<P>At <B>ASHTAR</B>, we seek only to express ourselves, not to announce
or proclaim anything. The main characteristic of our theatre is playing;
to find logic through describing and transforming. And, in that sense,
we hope that in our productions we have revealed a ‘common’ truth. </P>

<CENTER><P>For our students, we have tried to chose plays that will combine
a sense of joy with a voyage of self-discovery. During their three years
of training with us, we tried to find a story/ an approach, that would
be contemporary with their level of understanding as well as relevant to
their everyday lives.</P></CENTER>
