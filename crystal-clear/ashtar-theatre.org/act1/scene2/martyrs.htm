<P>&quot;Martyrs are Coming Back....&quot;, was staged by our resident
professional team working with two of our graduates who had gone on to
become part of our first ‘Drama Teachers’ Training’ course . </P>

<P>Although based on the novel of the same name by the Algerian writer,
At-Taher Wattar, &quot;Martyrs are Coming Back....&quot;, was re-arranged
and re-visualized for stage by our very own Sameh Hijazi, who also included
as an prologue and epilogue, two poems by the German playwright and director
Heiner Mueller. </P>

<P><B>In Islam, a martyr becomes immortal and his sacrifice bestows great
honour upon his family. In the play, Um El Izz is the mother of a martyr,
who died for his country. She is visited by a sign, an anonymous letter.
She slips into a deep sleep and dreams. </B></P>

<P><B>She then wakes up, to talk only about her vision - the return of
the martyrs - and goes into the streets to proclaim the event. Yet for
the others in the city, her vision is unsettling. It presents them with
both a theological paradox and a social problem. </B></P>

<P><B>On a more fundamental level, Um El Izz herself becomes the problem:
As a woman she represents Mother Earth, struggling to survive in the midst
of social and psychological decay. As a mother, she is the symbol of criticism
of patriarchal society, she is the element that reveals the ultimate nakedness
of man. </B></P>

<P><B>She sees the dilemma of a mother, expected to break into cheers at
the martyrdom of her son. She describes herself as the earth when it is
divided and burnt. </B></P>

<P><B>At every turn, there is public fear and criticism of Um El Izz and
her dream. Speaking to people from all walks of life, she stumbles against
closed doors. Although her words pry open windows in their bare homes,
the sealed doors are much stronger. Her enthusiasm and vision gradually
fade. </B></P>

<P><B>She pierces the wall with her death. </B></P>

<P>We took the theological paradox of a Martyr and juxtaposed it with the
particular problems we see in our society, particularly the tradition against
a female’s vision. In this sense the play is highly topical, but we have
tried to approach it in an artistic, rather than overtly political way.

demonstrate the many faces in each person - and how we often react differently
to a problem when we view it from either a social, political or economical
point of view.</TT></TD>

<TD><TT>Two men each have two faces, represented with masks to the front
and back: . One mask is blue - bourgeois aspirations and pride. . The other
is yellow - commercial interest and greed. . The third man’s face is split

of MAN.</TT>
