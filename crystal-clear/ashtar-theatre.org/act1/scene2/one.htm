<P>As part of our recruitment drive for the Drama Teaching Program, we
got in touch with some members of the theatre community in <B>Gaza</B>.
When we arrived to hold auditions we were overcome by the scale of interest
and demand. We ran a two-year program of basic theatre training for 12
participants, the final flourish of which was a full production, in summer,
1996. </P>

<P>There were three performances to the general public, held at the YMCA
in Gaza city. The cast consisted of 8 actors and 1 actress - <B>the first
actress ever to appear on the stage in Gaza!</B> </P>

<P>&quot;<B>One For The Road</B>&quot;, written in the 1970’s, is regarded
as Pinter’s most complex work. He is attacking both the European middle-class
intellectuals and an imperial media. When it was performed in Gaza, it
was at a time of great social and political change.......the end of the
Intifada, the beginnings of autonomy with rule by the Palestinian National
Authority. </P>

<P>As it stood, the play was a reminder of a past time we hoped we were
rid of, and a warning of potential pitfalls in the long and difficult road
ahead. </P>
