<P>A double celebration, Shakespeare’s 400th birthday and our first ‘graduate’
production. </P>

<P>At ASHTAR we feel strongly that theatre should mirror the local language
and geographical dialects. Thus presenting translator Sameh Hijazi with
a double-sided concern: </P>

<P><B>&quot;On the one hand, I was deeply committed to preserving the spirit
of the discourse - the essence of the drama. At the same time I was seeking
a parallel, an indigenous frame that would render to our native audience
the same colours, shapes and themes&quot;. </B></P>

<P>Nevertheless, despite drawing inferences mainly from the realms of Greek
mythology and English/Irish folklore, the emotions wrought by the characters
evoke a universal philosophy; the strongest example or parallel of which
is the Islamic interpretation of <B>fate</B>. The story of &quot; <B><I>A
Midsummer Night’s Dream</I></B>&quot; is a combination of ancient history
and the present, nature and mythology which, in one way or another, streams
into our contemporary society. The theatrical experience attained here
involves the discovery of new realms by means of a mental adventure in
the unknowns of life through maxims, fables and an unprecedented manner
of challenging the present. That is why ASHTAR chose this theatrical dream
for its trainees to encounter. </P>

<TD><TT>While he was translating adapting the play Sameh noticed many comparisons
between Irish-based and oriental folklore. He wanted to bring the story
home to our audiences and so he gave it a typical Arab setting. The workers
names were translated into thier equivalent signifies in Arabic; tailor,
carpenter and so on. Here you can see Abu Tubeh (the tailor), Kamalekah
( the carpenter ) and Abu Hasweh ( the builder ) rehearsing their performance.</TT><BR>

<TD><TT>With her always, Titania kept a delicate glass orb containing smaller
glass cells and a flower. The flower represents life flow, the cells our
family and its fragilty reminds us of the tenuous position of the earth
- and a terrifying possibility ........</TT></TD>

a semi-circle, on stage, for the whole performance.</TT></TD>
