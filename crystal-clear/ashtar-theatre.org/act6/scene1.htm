<P>As you have by now, (we hope!), read through our pages of productions
and training programs with growing admiration and respect, you will, no
doubt, be wondering what you can do to get in on our act - so to speak......
</P>

<P>Well, there are hundreds of ways in which you can help us, starting
from simply learning about us and telling your friends, through linking
up with us on joint projects. But let us point out, ladies and gentlemen,
that we are also not opposed to, shall we say,...... a little financial
support....? </P>

<P>We are lucky enough to receive funds from a number of theatre bodies,
and we get grants from time to time. We do charge a fee from our students
too, but we try to subsidise them as much as possible due to the dire financial
situation most of them, as Palestinian youngsters are in. <B>We are not
an elitist theatre</B> - our programs are available to all, perhaps most
importantly to those who would not be able to get this kind of outlet anywhere
else. </P>

<P>So, what this all boils down to is an invitation or an opportunity to
<B>avoid </B>the hazards of, what the World Bank politely describes as
&quot;<B>mis-direction of funds</B>&quot;, and put your money directly
to work in one of the most open-minded, optimistic and successful educational
projects in Palestine today. </P>

<P>Following are some of the projects and ideas that, with your help, we
would like to put into operation: </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Audio Visual Room</FONT></B>. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">To read about and to see International Theatre,
has always been difficult in Palestine. Palestinian theatre makers had
to create their own home libraries. An expensive proposition especially
if one lacks the means and the facilities to do so. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">We have the room, now we need to fill it with
theatre books and magazines, drama and theatre reviews, video cassettes
and publications in the different fields of theatre such as; Drama in Education;
Youth Theatre; Senography; Make-up and lighting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">We need support to purchase books and magazine
and review subscriptions, and we would also greatly appreciate donations
of second hand theatre books (in good condition) from libraries, theatres
and institutions. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Getting around, festivals and tours.</FONT></B> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">Much as we love this little country of ours, a
vital part of our mission is to take opur stories, ideas and challenges
to the rest of the world. The problem is we don’t have a magic carpet .......
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">Often we are invited to participate in festivals
and cultural events in countries who, for one reason or another, are not
in a position to help us get to them. We hate to turn anyone down, yet
financial constraints time and again force us to stay put. A very frustrating
and unecessary situation .... it doesn’t have to be like this. With your
help, we can be the mouse that roars once again: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">1. We try to get to at least 2 festivals every
year. We’d like to go farther afield, and join our soulmates in Europe
and the United States. To do so, we need approximately $10,000 to transport
7 of us and our equipment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">2. At the moment, we are using our own cars to
transport eachother around. This is a big pain in the neck, because often
our famillies need them for other reasons. Also, small cars are not the
ideal way to get around, especially in this part of the world, where safety
lies in numbers and getting separated en route can literally be disasterous.
We would love to get a small minibus, so we can all travel together and
minimise overheads and driver fatigue. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Audio-visual equipment</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">We desperately need a VCR and TV set to go in
to the Audio-visual room mentioned above. We ahad an arrangement with one
organisation but unfortunately it seems they were just pulling our leg!
How would you like to restore our faith? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF4242">In addition we also need a video camera, in order
to make and send promotional videos for interested groups, potential funders
and co-workers, and to set up an archive of all our hard work. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">In order to send us money there is some important
information you need to know: <A HREF="scene2.htm">Vital Statistics</A></FONT></P>
