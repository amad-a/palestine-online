<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcome to the ASHTAR Theatre ( Virtual ! ) Walking Tour.
</H3>

<P>We’re very proud of our theatre, the building as well as the concept.
We call it the ASHTAR Studio, and its located on the Bir Zeit road in Ramallah,
the cultural capital of Palestine. We are here... </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="location.gif" HEIGHT=186 WIDTH=340></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
The ASHTAR STUDIO and facilities, are for us and for the community. We
use it to hold theatre workshops, and perform productions organized by
ASHTAR and to host those by other Palestinian groups or visitors. The two
halls are designed to have ongoing training and rehearsing programs during
the day, and small performances at nights. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">So, why are we in Ramallah and not the capital
Jerusalem? </FONT></B></P>

<P>The ASHTAR STUDIO is based in Ramallah for a reason. After the brutal
separation of Jerusalem from the West Bank, Ramallah again became the dynamic
city and trade center which it had been before the Intifada. We tried to
have our studio in Jerusalem but never succeeded ... the non-stop closures
of the West Bank were always in our way.At ASHTAR, we teach students coming
from Ramallah, Bir Zeit, Bethlehem and Jerusalem. </P>

<P>West Bank students cannot enter Jerusalem without permits from the Department
Coordination Office ... more often than not, they cannot get such a permit
... it takes months and if they get it ... it’s no guarantee... maybe they
will cross the ‘border’ too late... maybe collective punishment will cancel
all permits (as is so often the case) ... then they have to start the permit
process all over again. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">What the studio means to us... </FONT></B></P>

<P>We’re always talking about how our theatre work with the youth carries
them from a realm of wanting....to doing.... Well, the studio stands as
an example of our own journey in that way. </P>

<P>Firstly, because as a physical edifice it represents the hard work and
struggle we have gone through in the last six years, the endless round
of visits to schools and universities talking to them about our vision
.........the search for support and funds ......... the resistance of the
society. </P>

<P>Secondly, because even when we found the building our work didn’t end.
Theatres don’t exactly come ready made round here! </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">‘ Vital Statistics’ </FONT></B></P>

<P>The ASHTAR STUDIO is a 300 sq. meter complex made up of two studios,
each one is 12.50 x 5.00 meters. </P>

<P>- The EMW ( Black) studio has a wooden and PVC floor. <BR>
- The Canada ( White) studio also has a wooden floor and PVC floor and
funds permitting we will have mirrored walls. </P>

<P>Both halls are equipped with ceiling grids for lighting and technical
out-fitting to make them comfortable, practical, and efficient working
spaces. </P>

<P>The ASHTAR STUDIO complex also has:</P>

<P>- A Forum (8 x 4 meters) - A Costume and Make-up Workshop (9 x 4 meters)<BR>
- A kitchenette - 3 Administration Office - An Audio-Visual Room<BR>
- A Storage Space and set workshop (10 x 4 meters) - 3 Rest Rooms. <BR>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>To read about, and to see International Theatre, has always been difficult
in Palestine. Palestinian theatre makers had to create their own home libraries.
An expensive proposition especially if one lacks the means and the facilities
to do so. </P>

<P>ASHTAR’s Audio Visual Library will be a 4x4 metre room, surrounded by
shelves. Two tables and 8 chairs find space in it with a TV, a video recorder
and a small size screen. </P>

<P>For more infromation on how to help us with our Audio-visual library
- or other projects, see &quot;ýThe Bit Where We Ask You For Money...&quot;

<P>The nerve centre = a paradox. Where we hate having to be, when our natural
place is on stage. Yet without it, we wouldn’t be here, or there, or with
you. Without it, we wouldn’t have the money to do all the things we’ve
done. Or a snowball’s chance in hell of doing anything else! </P>

<P><B>But hey</B>! Just because we have a great office doesn’t mean we’re
rolling in dough. In fact, we are more than ready to help you spend yours
- if you have plenty and are wondering how to put it to good use. Look
no further, wait no longer, send us your cash and we’ll love you forever.
</P>

<P>Seriously though, we still have to equip our Audio- Visual room, which
is growing in real time, and like a baby wakes us up in the night sometimes,
when we’re worrying about how to pay for it! </P>
