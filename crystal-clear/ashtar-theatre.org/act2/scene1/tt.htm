Artistic Director </B></P>

<P>Team Training starts in October and runs for the next educational year.
It will be one full day per week. </P>

<P>The idea of Team Training is to provide a forum for our graduates and
professional acting team, about eight in all. It will give us an opportunity
to share new ideas, air our views, opinions and dreams. We see it as a
vital part of our mission, to cement our team together, to keep our group
alive and fresh. </P>

<P>Team Training - as its name suggests- is a program of meetings, seminars
and group activities, that enables us to build on and develop our understanding
of the theatre world. </P>

<P>The lectures and discussions are considered in terms of; Theatre History;
Theatre Theory and New Acting Methods and Techniques. </P>

<P>We cover a diverse and exciting curriculum. Reflecting the wide range
of knowledge and skills within the group and also the interests and directions
that the group wants to explore. </P>
