ASHTARTheatre has joined forces with MARALAM theatre to create a production thatis a frank but sensitive cultural dialogue of the persisting divisionsand differences between men and women (the female characters portray themen in their lives from their own perspective), East and West as well asEast and East (the Mashrek and the Gulf). The result is a production thatis as relevant to the West as to the Arab world, as important for men aswell as women to see and consider.<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Featuring?
