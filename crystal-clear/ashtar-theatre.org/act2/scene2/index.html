<P>Hand in hand with its teaching commitments, ASHTAR is also a professional
acting ensemble who undertake to produce two productions per year. This
year, 1998, we are continuing with our Forum Theatre serial production,
Abu Shaker's Affairs '98 and in honour of two important milestones for
Palestinian Theatre in 1998 our second production, due to tour in this
country and abroad is Fluchtlingeshprache (Meditation of a Fugitive) by
Bertolt Brecht. Chosen to <B>celebrate 100 years of Brecht's life and contributions
to Theatre </B>and also to commemorate the <B>50th year of the Nakba </B>-
the forced emigration of Palestinians following the 1948 war. More information
about both these productions can be found in the Hot Zone.</P>

<P>Between 1999 and 2000 our two international productions are also timed
to coincide with important events or contemporary issues. </P>

<P><B><U>1999 - The Women of Sand and Myrrh by Hanan El-Shaykh, adapted
for stage by Iman Aoun and Peter Braschler. </U></B></P>

<P>An all female cast of four characters, who lives cross somewhere in
the desert. It is the story about the lives of four women from different
social and cultural backgrounds whose meet in an unnamed Arab desert country.
These four very different women, living somewhere in the Middle East, show
us what it means to try to reach their own individual identity by expressing
their aspirations, hopes and actions in a male dominated society. </P>

<P><B><U>2000 - The Great King adapted for stage by Mazen Sae'deh and Sameh
Hijazi.</U></B></P>

<P>The Great King is based on a Cananite text discovered at the beginning
of this century at Ras Shamra (the old Augarit Kingdom). It is a play that
includes and exhibits important details and aspects of the rich Cananite
mythology, a mythology that has enriched others but has been intentionally
ignored or disclaimed , because of its paradoxes - within a long historical
burglary - with Hebrew mythology. It is due to tour the region during the
millennium celebrations, including the Bethlehem 2000 festival. </P>
