<b><h2>Cell Division:  An Aesthetic View</h2>

<p><b>
I was born in Jerusalem in Palestine in 1936.  Losing my country remained 
painful throughout my life.  Pictures have always fascinated me deeply.  
I spent hours of reverie looking at the little oil paintings my father 
brought to our home in Yafa.
<p>
There have been times when paintings possessed me and times when I remember
making them with the relaxed ease of a sunny afternoon.  Whenever I found
myself bored with them I tried to find new directions.  There were times of
confusion when my friends would fear coming to my house because at such times 
I would besiege them with requests for criticism.
<p>
Today, flat two dimensional pictures are so numerous, so cheep, and so 
omnipresent that we forget that only seventy years ago they were rare
expensive commodities.  I think more pictures were made during the past century
than in all previous centuries.  We use them for a variety of functions and
most of them serve our needs by aiding the production of life's necessities.
Pictures are a useful magnificent language.
<p>
I try to explore the language of pictures.  I do not believe that 
contemporary symbolist and surrealist tendencies will advance the art of 
picturing.  I think they are an artistic dead end.  But they are fashionable 
and my abstract paintings are very unfashionable now.  I know!  But, I think 
that it is in the area of abstraction as the concrete imitation of motion in
reality that new ideas will grow.
<p>
In computers I found a medium that caused new developments
in my painting.  To use this medium for what it can best do
and not for imitating older media meant learning to program.  I did.
Afterward, I wrote programs which produce kinetic paintings with sound.  
I did this on the Amiga.  Now I use a PC.  I have written a program which 
allows me to perform paintings live while jamming with musicians.
<p>
The computer has brought an intellectual cell-division in my thinking on
painting.  All that is gestural and textural has gone into my oil and acrylic
paintings while the hard geometry that used to be in my static paintings has
migrated to my programmed kinetic paintings.  Thus the paintings in this 
studio, although made with the computer, being static reflect more the 
gestural thinking.
