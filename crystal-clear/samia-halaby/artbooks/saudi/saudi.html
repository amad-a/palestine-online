<H2>Homage to Mona Saudi</H2>
<p>A drawing by Samia A. Halaby<p>
<b><p>

Please read this scroll from right to left.  These pictures are of a continuous drawing
which filled a scroll that is 72 feet long.  It records the stone sculptor, Mona Saudi, in 
her home and working in her studio.  It was painted in 1997 in Amman by Palestinian artists 
Samia A. Halaby to document her admiration and friendship with the sculptor.<p>

"After entering the gate on the right are some wonderful dark green trees.<p>
2..<img align=top src="118-1865tn.jpg"></a><p>
There are large antique urns which Mona Saudi has collected and placed between the trees.<p>
3..<img align=top src="118-1864tn.jpg"></a><p>
Through the dark green trees and up some terraces to the narrow back garden, I walk and draw with wash and brush.<P>
4..<img align=top src="118-1835tn.jpg"></a><p>
Here I find more antiques.  A collection of stones and potted plants 
speaks of her love affair with stone.<p>
5..<img align=top src="118-1863tn.jpg"></a><p>
Each friend of Mona's has adopted a tree. Mine is the little lemon tree 
which produces profusely.  It is a beautiful teenaged tree.<p>
6..<img align=top src="118-1862tn.jpg"></a><p>
This is a huge antique grinding stone in Saudi's collection. <p>
7..<img align=top src="118-1836tn.jpg"></a><p>
Found and favored stones are arranged in all parts of the 
garden -- in the flower beds and on the stone surfaces.<p>
8..<img align=top src="118-1837tn.jpg"></a><p>
More of the antiques and more flower pots line the garden.<p>
9..<img align=top src="118-1858tn.jpg"></a><p>
From the Back narrow patio-like garden, my brush jumps to the front 
garden.  There even more found stones line each part of the garden.<p>

10..<img align=top src="118-1838tn.jpg"></a><p>
As I draw just in front of the main entrance, Saudi sits to read her morning 
paper under the two fig trees -- my favorite spot -- and I continued drawing my scroll.<p>
11..<img align=top src="118-1856tn.jpg"></a><p>
Further down into the garden there are many trees each of which has been
claimed by a friend. A small fig tree is surrounded by stones<p>  
12..<img align=top src="118-1854tn.jpg"></a><p>
I go inside and look at prints and through windows.  <p>
13..<img align=top src="118-1842tn.jpg"></a><p>
Out the large windows are the tree friends.  The most important tree of 
all is the tree of Mona Saudi's daughter -- the wonderful beautiful Dia.<p>
14..<img align=top src="118-1843tn.jpg"></a><p>
In the living room are more and more stones.  The big stones have gone through Saudi's
hands and have been transformed into great sculpture.<p>
15..<img align=top src="118-1844tn.jpg"></a><p>
In the extreme right is the sculpture of the ancient Arab Goddess -- El Latt.  Mona 
told me that she carved her blindfolded so that she would not see the shameful acts
of Arab Governments.<p>
16..<img align=top src="118-1845tn.jpg"></a><p>
Here I find more stones, amazing sculptures.<p>
17..<img align=top src="saudi/118-1846tn.jpg"></a><p>
Here are more sculptures.<p>
18..<img align=top src="118-1848tn.jpg"></a><p>
Passing the table full of tools in the drawing studio, I enter her sculpting studio.
and I notice the inspirational remarks which she has scribbled on the walls in Arabic -- messages
 to herselff about stones.<p>
19..<img align=top src="118-1849tn.jpg"></a><p>
She is there working, examining pieces.<p>
20..<img align=top src="118-1851tn.jpg"></a><p>
She peaks at them around the corner; she pushes them into place; she examines and thinks.<p>
21..<img align=top src="118-1852tn.jpg"></a><p>
Hammer and chisel in hand, Saudi begins carving as I continue drawing <p>
22..<img align=top src="118-1853tn.jpg"></a><p>
Saudi picks-up an electric drill as I complete 72 feet of ink drawing."
