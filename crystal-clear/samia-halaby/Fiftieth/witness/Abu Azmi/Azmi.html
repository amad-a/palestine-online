<b>Abu Azmi</b>
<p>
<b>Speaking about the Kafr Qasem Massacre</b>
<p>

I saw the bodies of the martyrs scatters on the ground.  I was fourteen years old.  I was 
returning from the plain in the company of Muhammad Assi known as Abu Samaha.  Gazi Darweesh, 
my paternal unkle Ismail mahmoud, Muhammad Abdalraheem and the daughter of Ismail, Radiyya, 
and the daughters of Abu Samaha.  
<p>

We were traveling in two carts, and when we reached the spot of the event, the soldiers 
stopped us and took the men to one side.  I myself continue to proceed.  One of the soldiers 
called me screaming.  I went three steps and suddenly saw 3 bodies thrown on the ground, their 
bicycles on top of their bodies.  It appeared to me that they were the first three to die in 
the massacre.  They are Ali Uthman Tah, Abdalraheem Ismir Budeir, and Ahmad Sous Friej.

<p>

I reached a distance of 50 meters and heard the soldiers talking with the martyr Ghazi 
Darweesh and those who remained with him.  They said �Where are you from?  Where are your 
dentity cards?�  They did not give them the opportunity to bring out their identity cards.  
They fired on them and killed them.

<p>

As the place was open, I saw from a distance, Uthman Abed Himad 
Isaa, known as Abu Shareef, and his son with their goats.  I saw how the soldiers fired on 
the martyre Fathi and his father right in front of our eyes.  

<p>

I continued walking along with my cousin Muhammad Abdalraheem, and the girl Radiyya 
daughter of my unkle Ismail.  We were approached by the vehicle of Abdallah ismail Isaa 
while the soldiers were behind him.  I saw the martyre, Saleh Mahmoud Amer, try to hold 
onto the vehicle but the soldiers prevented him from climbing on to it.

<p>

And when I reached the home of Abu Fareed, I met an old man, the now departed Mousa Abu 
Dahoud, screaming �my son, my son!�  The least criminal of the border police stopped the 
jeep and they asked him what he wanted.  They pointed downward implying he is down below.

<p>

I reached home and told my father that they are killing the villagers.  He did not believe me.  
I have told the story of the massacre to all my children � four girls and two boys � so 
that no one will forget this horrific massacre.  I remember all the events as fresh as the 
first time � the moments of it pass clearly in front of me � oh my God! inspire me with patience!
