We were anxious as we drove to you.  My friend pointed out the total ethnic cleansing of the
surrounding area.  "No sign of Palestine remains here" she said.  My anger flashed.  I reject
this Israeli brutality as final.  I saw the name of an Arab town on a road sign.  It justified
my immediate objection.  But I could feel the stench of brutality in these scenes of Israeli
crime.  Images of their acts flashed in my head.  And then from far away we saw you on a 
hill.  As the first of your many minarets appeared, we voiced joy and relief.

Kafr Qasem! You move me.  You are a sign.  You are a beacon in the dark - a lighthouse 
for troubled travelers.  You fill the painful void of Palestine in my heart.   Grow and 
blossom.  I came to teach my art but received a better lesson on heroism.  I did not 
expect to find so much beauty and the precious traditions of Palestine so solidly embraced 
and preserved.  I feel again the power of our culture and determination.  This is a 
precious gift.

	Our meeting place was the monument to the victims.  We drove past 
it.  We returned and were found by our hosts who welcomed us with flowers.  I smiled 
from ear to ear at their beauty.  They too were flowers.  Then together, we went to the 
memorial stone located at the original scene of the massacre at Kafr Qasem.  There I placed 
my flowers.  I looked with dismay at the quantity of names etched there in the stone and was 
told that there were 49.  But really there should be 50 because one of the victims was a woman
in the ninth month of her pregnancy.

After the day's activities, a young medical student escorted our departure on his motor 
cycle.  Having arrived on our own the long way around, we were grateful to be shown the unmarked 
short way.  We hated to part from him and his wonderful town.  For goodbye he said:  
"Please give our message to all Palestinians.  Tell them to come back to their homes and 
lands."
<p>
One of the many missing services for Arabs under Israeli rule is adequate signage to 
towns and villages still occupied by Arabs.  Of course there is good signage to the vast 
majority of Israeli towns, and cities which are, in fact, occupied Arab towns and cities. 
Israelis do not provide services to Arab towns even while they collect heavy taxes and 
apply heavily the oppressive control by police and military forces.
<p>
Do you know about Kafr Qasem?  This was a village of approximate 1500 people in 1956 
when the French and the British helped Israel attack the Suez.  Under the cover of war, the 
Israeli forces decided to continue what had been done in 1948.  That 
is the brutal eviction of Palestinian Arabs from their homes and lands of Palestine.  These 
Israelis were after all building their little 
new state by destroying ours.  They felt that they had the right to kill, rape, rob, and 
torture. Their genocidal acts describe them well.  
<p>
It was the evening of October 29, 1956 when Israelis approached Kafr Qasem to kill unarmed 
workers returning home after work.  The massacre was cold blooded, premeditated, ordered from 
above, and part of Israeli State policy.  
<p>
The brutality of the act coupled with the isolation and social oppression of the village 
created deep psychological and emotional wounds.  In a struggle to survive the general
destruction applied by Israel to Palestinian life and culture, Kafr Qasem reacted by
giving life.  Having been a village of approximately 1500 residents in 1956, it has become 
now become a town of 15,000 in this year of 1999.  Grow Kafr Qasem.  You are a great gift.
