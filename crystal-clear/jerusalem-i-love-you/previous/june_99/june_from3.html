     <FONT size="-1"><B>OCCUPIED JERUSALEM (25 APRIL)</B></FONT>- The Israeli occupation authorities destroyed in 1997 as many as 170 Palestinian homes throughout the West Bank as part of punitive measures against the Palestinian population.
<P>A report published on 24 April by the Jerusalem-based Legal Centre for the Protection of Land said most of the demolished homes were located in the area "C", where the Israeli army maintains complete control.</P>
<P>Some of the destroyed homes, however, were in area "B", where Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authorityis supposed to exercise "civilian control".</P>
<P>The demolition of three homes late last year (in full view of Palestinian policemen) at Asira al Shamaliya, which is under PA civilian control, is a pertinent example.</P>
<P>The report also pointed out that the Israeli government had transferred large sums of money to the settlements for expansion.</P>
<P>Moreover, the report put the number of Jewish settlers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip at 161,000, of which 155,000 are in the West Bank and the rest in the Gaza Strip.</P>
<P>Finally, the report pointed out that the Israeli Government was about to transfer 3,500 Ethiopian immigrants to West Bank settlements.</P>

<FONT size="-1"><B>OCCUPIED JERUSALEM</B></FONT> - A Palestinian villager was seriously injured and a Jewish settler was killed on 23 April in a shoot-out that took place outside a Jewish settlement southwest of Hebron.
<P>Aqel (um Salah), recounted how her father and three children were gunned down and how she herself was going to face the same fate had she not pretended to be dead.</P>
<P>Latter on, Um Salah, along with some participants, commuted to the site of the massacre at Deir Yassin, now renamed Giva'at Shaul.</P>
<P>There the Israeli authorities have obliterated all but a few vestiges of what was once a prosperous Arab village. However, Um Salah's home, where her father and three children were butchered before her very eyes by the Irgun terrorists, is still intact. The occupant of the premise, a pharmacist, emerged shouting at Um Salah, who at the time deeply in tears, "Who are you and what do you want?" "Nothing ," she said, "nothing."</P>
<P>According to Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, the Dier Yassin genocide was "a deliberate act aimed at frightening the Arabs into fleeing the area." Even Menachem Begin, was one of Israel's arch terrorists, describes the massacre in his book, The Revolt, on pages 164-165, as "the biggest miracle to take place in the war of liberation because it made the Palestinians fleeï¿½"</P>
<P>Interestingly, Deir Yassin was only one massacre out of many, as the list of Jewish atrocities of the helpless Palestinian people is too long to be described in one article or even in one book.</P>

			<TD><A name="news4"><H3><FONT color="#FF0000">Jewish Militants Occupy Arab Houses in Jerusalem</FONT></H3></A>

<B><FONT size="-1">OCCUPIED JERUSALEM (AFP)</FONT></B>- Three Jewish couples occupied houses in an Arab quarter of East Jerusalem on Tuesday in a bid to create a new Jewish neighborhood and scuttle Palestinian claims on the city.
<P>Three couple linked to a far-right Jewish religious organization moved into the houses in East Jerusalem's Shaikh Jarrah neighborhood, claiming the area belonged to a "vibrant" Jewish community that fled Arab rioting in the 1930's.</P>
<P>Rabbi Benny Elon, a Member of Parliament, led the settlers from the extreme right-wing Molodet party who timed the move to coincide with campaigning for general elections next month.</P>
<P>"With God's blessing, we're finally renewing the Jewish presence in this neighborhood," said Elon, who setup a religious seminary last year in another Arab area in the nearby Mount of Olives.</P>
<P>The men in the three couples who moved into the area all study at Elon's Beit Orot seminary and did not appear fully aware of the political implications of the action.</P>
<P>"We heard it was important for us to live here came, it's a good deed," said Yohai Naor, a 21-year-old newlywed as he stood alongside his bride, Ayalett.</P>
<P>"They said the home belonged legally to Jews, I'm not invading or occupying anything," he said as other religious students hauled furniture, kitchen appliances and other goods to the three houses.</P>
<P>There was no immediate reaction from Palestinian residents of the area despite the warnings that the settler move could spark protests, notably due to the proximity of the area to Orient House, the controversial Palestinian political headquarters for Jerusalem.</P>
<P>The group plans to purchase back the rights to all homes in the area and has already renovated a nearby synagogue dating back to the days of the earlier Jewish presence and a nearby building for use as an office, he said.</P>
<P>Three other Beit Orot students quietly moved into Shaikh Jarrah houses late last week, but Tuesday's arrivals marked the first "families" to settle there, Bank sais.</P>
<P>Some 160,000 Jews have settled in East Jerusalem since 1967, but most live in new high-rise complexes built on the outskirts of the sector, which is home to around 200,000 Palestinians.</P>
