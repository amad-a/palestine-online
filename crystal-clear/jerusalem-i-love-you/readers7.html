<a href="previous/november_99/nov99_article1.html">The Growth of the Western Communities, 1917-1948
From Jerusalem 1948<br>
By Rochelle Davis</a></p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>

<p>I read the above article with great interest. I am a Palestinian, born in Jerusalem in 1938 and now reside in London England. I am the son of the late Wasfi Anabtawi who died in London in 1984 at the age of 83 after open heart surgery.</p>

<p>The information you have written about my late father on pages 17 and 18 of the above article is so accurate with the exception of one point i.e. my father graduated from Cambridge University in 1934 with a degree in Master of Arts.</p> 

<p>You may wish to include in your article the following brief information about my late father:</p>

<ol start="1">
<li value="1">In 1948 we moved from Palestine to Damascus Syria where my late father taught history, geography and English literature at Damascus University. He later went on to work for a while for the UN in Damascus.</li>

<li value="2">In 1952 we moved to Amman Jordan where my late father worked as a Director- Deputy to the Chairman at the Arab Bank until his retirement at the age of 62.</li>

<li value="3">He then went on to serve as a Minister of Finance during the late King Hussein's reign and worked as a visiting professor teaching geography at the Jordanian University and Military College.</li> 

<li value="4">After his retirement in 1974 his hobby was to translate books from Arabic to English until he died in London in 1984 and was buried in Jordan.</li>
</ol>

<p>My late father left 3 children, my elder brother Bassam., myself and my younger brother Osama.</p>
<p>
I hope the above information can be added to your library. Once again the above article was very educational and I may take this opportunity to wish you the best of success in your work. 
</p>
<p>Kind Regards.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully</p>

Thank you for the letter you sent by mail.<br>
The information about your father was taken from a book published by Badil in Jerusalem. You can visit their site at (<a href="http://www.badil.org">www.badil.org</a>).<br>
We faxed them your letter and hopefully it will help them when they update their book.<br>
The book is called Jerusalem 1948, we will mail you a copy as gift from us.</i>
