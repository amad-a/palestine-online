<p>Hi! I'm taking a class at Franklin University in Columbus, OH, United States, called Emergence of a Global Culture. We study the development of the world and its diverse cultures from the beginning of time. This
involves World History, World Geography, World Religions, and Philosophy.</p>

<p>I am writing an end term essay (as opposed to a final exam) and I am including the fact that within the Old City of Jerusalem, there are four quadrants named for the religious affiliations that exist in each quadrant, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian.</p>

<p>My question is: How do all of these diverse religious cultures coexist together? Are they peaceful? Or is there a lot of disagreements, uprisings, and fighting amongst the members of the different quadrants?</p>

<p>My thesis is that wisdom derived from an understanding of the past is imperative for members of diverse cultures to be able to live together peacefully as one country. So, I need to know if The Old City can be used as a good positive example of this occurring or as a negative example. Do the residents of The Old City get along? Are they tolerant of their neighbors regardless of what their religious beliefs may be?</p>

<p>Any assistance you can give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<i><p>Dear Jacqui:</p>
There are 2 people living in Jerusalem now, Palestinians (Moslems and Christians) and the Jews who are supported by the Israeli government and can live wherever they want while the Arabs are forced to leave the city one by one.<br>
Also you should know that Armenians do not have their own religious, they are Christians who have their own churches, just like Orthodox or Baptists.<br>
Historically, all these religious communities lived together rather peacefully. We can maybe say that the biggest disagreements were over who of the Christian communities will control the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. And yes, the old City of Jerusalem was a good positive example before the Zionists occupied it.</i>
