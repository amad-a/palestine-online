peace accord may begin after all  this week after Yassir Arafat,
president of the Palestinian Authority,  reassured Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israeli prime minister, he had no  intention of using violence
to achieve his goals. Mr Netanyahu had delayed implementation
until Mr Arafat retracted his  statement calling for an armed
struggle against Israel. However, the  Authority, at least publicly,
did not receive any apology from Ariel  Sharon, foreign minister,
who told settlers to grab land wherever they  could.</FONT></P>

Sharon's daily bread has for years been the encouragement of 
institutional and private settlement in every part of &quot;Judea,
Samaria  and the Gaza region,&quot; and the paving of roads that
criss-cross the  territories. In every position Sharon has held
in the Israeli government  in recent years - as Minister of Defense,
Agriculture, Housing and  National Infrastructure - he has invested
his best efforts and the  public's resources into encouraging
settlement.</FONT></P>

 British police have been asked to assist in investigating an
alleged  Israeli spy mission in Cyprus which has damaged the reputation
of the  Mossad intelligence service and embarrassed the Israeli
government. A Cyprus court heard yesterday that Scotland Yard
has been contacted in  an attempt to trace phone calls from Britain
to mobile phones carried by  two Israelis - Udi Argov and Ig'al
Damari - said by Cypriot police to be  Mossad agents. Israel has
not denied this claim. The district court in  Larnaca yesterday
extended the men's detention order for five more days. Phonecalls
traced so far include several to an intelligence institute in
 Tel Aviv. The phones used a billing address in England and one
in  Holland.</FONT></P>

In an attempt to rebuild religious identity among young Jews,
who are  marrying non-Jews and abandoning the faith in large numbers,
Jewish  organizations plan to start a program that will pay for
any Jew in the  world between age 15 and 26 to travel to Israel
for 10 days. The program, Birthright Israel, is expected to cost
$300 million over  five years and to be financed by the Israeli
government, a group of  major Jewish donors from North America
and the Council of Jewish  Federations.Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu plans to announce the program  in Jerusalem
on Monday night in a speech to the General Assembly of the  Council
of Jewish Federations -- whose many American participants had
 intentionally defied a State Department travel advisory that
warned  American civilians to leave Israel because of a possible
Iraqi attack. </FONT></P>

Common sense set in after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel urged clemency for Jonathan Pollard in the final hours
of the peace talks in Maryland last month.George Tenet, the Director
of Central Intelligence, promptly threatened to resign if President
Clinton complied, bracing the President to reject the misplaced
plea. Then Republican Congressional leaders made it clear to the
Israelis that clemency was unacceptable. Mr. Pollard gravely damaged
American interests during the 1980's by selling some of America's
most sensitive intelligence information to Israel. To release
him now would compound that harm and not greatly advance peace
in the Middle East. </FONT></P>

Israel set the stage for a new confrontation with Palestinians
 yesterday when it opened bids to build a Jewish housing project
in East  Jerusalem. An Israeli decision to break ground at the
same site, Har Homa, in March  1997 had contributed to a long
breakdown in the peace process. Palestinian officials and some
Israeli opposition politicians condemned  yesterday's decision
as an attempt by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  to derail
the interim peace deal, which was approved by his Cabinet on 
Wednesday.. The Har Homa site is particularly sensitive because
it is one of the  last undeveloped areas ringing Jerusalem. Palestinians
say the housing  site was planned to ensure that the West Bank
would be totally cut off  from East Jerusalem by Jewish settlements.
