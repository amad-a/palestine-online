fresh killings</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Occupied Jerusalem � From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Palestinians throughout Palestine observed on 28
September the first anniversary of their intifada (uprising) against Israeli
occupation and apartheid, trigger-happy Israeli troops killed at least seven
more Palestinian civilians, including a ten-years-old child in a Hebron village.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Palestinian sources said Muhammed Tarayreh, of the village
of Bani Naim, 10 kilometres southeast of Hebron, was killed when Israeli troops
fired indiscriminately on Palestinian boys in the western part of the village.
Five more boys were reported wounded, one seriously.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Hebron, Israeli occupation soldiers stationed on
rooftops strafed the city centre with machine-gun fire, shedding still more
blood and terrorizing the civilian population. A 25-year-old youth, named Imam
Muhammed Sharif, was killed when occupation troops opened fire on Palestinian
worshippers who were just leaving the Ali Bakka Mosque following Friday's
congregational prayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hospital sources in Hebron said 20 people were injured,
including a young man identified as Zakariya Abu Rajab, who reportedly sustained
serious-to-critical gunshot wounds in the head and neck.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Bethlehem to the north, Israeli occupation troops opened
fire on a peaceful march marking the first anniversary of the intifada, killing
a teenager named Muhammed Sukkar.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A fourth Palestinian from a Ramallah village also died of
wounds he sustained earlier. The boy was identified as Muhsen Arar and his
family said he was shot deliberately by an Israeli sniper without any
provocation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;He was killed because he was Palestinian.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli tank fired an artillery shell
on a Palestinian civilian car near Rafah on Friday night (28 September) killing
at least three people. The latest killing brought to 13 the number of
Palestinian victims of Israeli-State terror in a 48-hour time span.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A hundred other civilians were also injured and maimed by
merciless Israeli forces, among them a two-year-old child from Rafah who,
hospital sources said, sustained a serious wound in the face.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets in
many cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, vowing to keep up the struggle
until &quot;deliverance from the shackles of Jewish occupation and
apartheid.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thousands headed to cemeteries to pay their respects for
the martyrs and lay wreaths, while thousands assembled in a Gaza stadium to
listen to Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, who vowed that the struggle
against apartheid and occupation would continue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;We have no choice but to continue the struggle; our
enemies want us to accept apartheid and come to terms with perpetual military
occupation. We will not. Nobody else the world over would. The right to resist
oppression is guaranteed by man and God alike, and we will uphold this
right,&quot; said Yasin before thousands of his followers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He added that, &quot;Our struggle is not against Jews as
Jews; it is against oppression, occupation and apartheid.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yasin recognized that the Palestinian people were paying a
dear price for their struggle, but added &quot;if we don't pay the price for
freedom, we will pay a hundred-fold as much in terms of humiliation,
enslavement, torment and persecution.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He lashed out at &quot;this hypocritical world that views
terrorism selectively.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;When Jewish forces murder Palestinian children in
cold blood, and when Palestinian towns and villages are reduced to concentration
camps, the world is silent and refuses to condemn the murder and terror, but
when the victims are of a different color, or citizens of a powerful State, then
the whole world is mobilized to fight the great menace.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<font color="#000000"><u><b>Victims are mostly
civilians</b><br>
</u>The Palestinian people have already paid a huge price for their struggle
over the course of the last year. It was a year of blood, tears and pain, and
each and every Palestinian household was affected in one way or the other.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the
Israeli army and paramilitary Jewish terrorists have killed as many as 690
Palestinians in the first year of the intifada, a third of them minors and
children.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The victims are mostly civilians, representing the entire
socio-economic spectrum of the Palestinian society. There were doctors, nurses,
teachers, schoolchildren, peasants and farmers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the hundreds of martyrs, Israeli bullets and
artillery and aerial bombardment of Palestinian population centres wounded more
than 25,000 people, with 5,000 of them sustaining crippling disabilities that
will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, the barbarians demolished and utterly destroyed
nearly a thousand homes, and Israeli bulldozers ravaged as many as 300,000
Palestinian-owned olive and fruit trees as well as vast tracts of verdant
fields.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The former British Foreign Secretary Ian Gilmore, who
visited the West Bank and Gaza in June, described the havoc and destruction the
Israelis inflicted on the Palestinian environment as &quot;an affront to
civilization.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Furthermore, the Israeli army used virtually all lethal
weapons of death at its disposal, including, inter alia, cluster bombs,
explosive bullets, pin-shaped bullets designed to cause maximum damage to
demonstrators and many kinds of asphyxiating gases, euphemistically called
&quot;tear gas.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">More to the point, the Zionists used extensively their air
force, including Apache helicopters and F-16 fighter jets, mainly against
undefended buildings and houses and the scantily and lightly armed Palestinian
policemen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Zionists also resorted to the diabolic policy of
assassination, murdering over 40 Palestinian political leaders, including Hamas
officials Jamal Mansour and Jamal Salim, PFLP leader Abu Ali Mustafa and Fatah
official Dr. Thabet Thabet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On 6 February, Ariel Sharon, a certified war criminal by
any standard, was elected by a landslide as Prime Minister of the Jewish State
after promising that he would crush the intifada and guarantee security for
Jewish settlers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, Sharon apparently failed to crush the uprising,
and to cover his failure to that effect, he escalated brutal repression against
Palestinian population centres, imposing a hermetic blockade on every
Palestinian town, village and hamlet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Following the 11 September terror attack on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, the U.S. pressurized the Zionist apartheid regime and
PA leader Yasser Arafat to meet and reach a &quot;cease-fire&quot; agreement,
apparently to enable the U.S. to enlist Arab States in the American-led crusade
against America's enemies, particularly Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden whom the
U.S. has accused of being responsible for the attacks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And after some procrastination and reluctance, Israeli
foreign minister Shimon Peres and Arafat met on 26 September in Gaza and agreed
to begin implementing the so-called Mitchell recommendations, prepared by an
international panel headed by former American senator George Mitchell.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, very few observers in Palestine believe that
genuine calm will be restored in Palestine without achieving a political
solution that would meet Palestinian aspirations for freedom from Jewish
apartheid and occupation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hence, it is likely that the bloodshed will continue, if
only because Sharon and the rest of the Israeli establishment continue to refuse
to pay the price for real peace, relying instead on unlimited American
financial, political and military support.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Needless to say, this wanton American support of Israeli
hegemony and aggression will only generate more resentment and hatred for the
U.S. among Muslims.</p>

<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#666666"><font color="#0000FF">Israeli oppression pushes Palestinians<br>
&nbsp;to �martyrdom operations�</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p><b>Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT<br>
</b>Many people around the world might think of the Palestinian �martyrdom
operations,� (or �suicidal bomb attacks� as much of the Western media
refer to the growing phenomenon) as something �weird� or �absolutely
eccentric.� However, to many of the Palestinian youths whose horizons are
constantly narrowed by an indescribably brutal Israeli military occupation,
martyrdom operations are a natural and inevitable reaction to an overwhelming
evil, which often transcends reality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One Palestinian youth told this news agency recently that
it was Israel who was pushing the Palestinians to martyrdom. �Israeli
oppression has transformed our life into a hell, they (the occupation) are
offering us the choice between being killed as meek sheep or die as
martyr-bombers,� said the young masked man.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials, this young
man is one of hundreds of young Palestinian men (and women) who are broaching
the military wings of the two movements, wanting to be �martyr-bombers.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">�For the first time, we are unable to absorb all the
applicants,� said Abu Nimer, a Hamas military official, using his <i>nom de
guerre</i> for security reasons. He pointed out that more and more Palestinians
were realizing that �martyrdom operations� are the most potent weapons with
which Palestinians can put up a semblance of deterrence in the face of
Israel�s awesome death machine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">�Israel can�t possibly scare somebody who wants to die.
Death is the ultimate fear, and our people have been able to overcome this
fear,� said the middle-aged Palestinian man from Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Abu Nimer dismisses Israeli and Western media reports about
martyr-bombers being motivated by promises of beautiful brides in heaven after
they die. �This is Zionist disinformation aimed at besmirching the purity of
our struggle. Our martyr-bombers do what they do because of the Zionist
oppression that defies linguistic description. It is no more than a boomerang
effect of Zionist Nazism against our people.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He adds, though, that �Almighty God promises martyrs who
die for the sake of freedom and justice to go to heaven. In our Islamic faith,
martyrs actually don�t die; they are transformed into a different form of life
unknown to the living.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another Islamist leader, from the smaller but growing
Islamic Jihad organization, stressed that �it is Israel, first and foremost,
that forces us to adopt martyrdom as our ultimate weapon against Zionist
brutality.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">�Nobody wants to die because he or she likes death�this
is a normal human feeling�but when life is no longer possible and becomes
worse than death, death becomes desirable.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This reasoning seems to find increasing, even overwhelming
acceptance among all strata of the Palestinian society, an acceptance
transcending political and even ideological orientations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Husein al-Tawil, an erstwhile member of the Palestinian
Communist party, described martyrdom operations as representing �the highest
revolutionary level among humans.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tawil, whose Islamist son died in a martyrdom operation
last March, dismissed rumours as �cheap propaganda� that potential
martyr-bombers are subject to �intensive brainwashing� by Hamas and Islamic
Jihad.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">�It is a canard like the many calumnies the Zionists have
spread in the course of the past year for the purpose of distorting our
struggle�Well, Hamas might be able to brainwash a few people, but it can�t
brainwash most of the people, and most Palestinians support martyrdom
operations.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to an opinion survey published by the Beit Sahur-based
Palestinian Public Opinion Centre recently, as many as 80% of Palestinians said
they were supportive of martyrdom operations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, a prominent PA official warned that �Israeli
State terrorism against us is turning hundreds of our people into suicidal
bombers. They are trying to force us into the corner, but the inevitable result
will be more suicidal bombers in Israeli urban centres,� said PA information
minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Abed Rabbo blamed the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon
for the 4 September attack in West Jerusalem in which 16 Israelis were injured.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">�The government that orders its death squads to
assassinate Palestinian political leaders and murder Palestinian civilians,
including children, ought to expect a reaction of this kind,� said Abed Rabbo
during a press conference in Ramallah a few hours after the incident.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For its part, it is obvious that Israel is unable to stop
the growing phenomenon if only because �you can�t stop somebody who is
coming to die,� in the words of the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some Israeli voices from the far right have been calling on
the Sharon government�s military establishment to adopt �unorthodox
solutions� for Palestinian martyrdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rahbaa�m Zevi, the far right wing minister of tourism who
advocates ethnic cleansing against non-Jews in Palestine, proposed recently the
bodies of Palestinian martyr-bombers be wrapped up in a pig skin, an animal that
is considered impure by Muslims. Zevi reasoned that if the would-be
martyr-bombers knew they would be wrapped up in a pig skin, they would not be
able to go to heaven.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Zevi�s remarks drew sarcastic reactions from Palestinian
leaders. �Oh, I never read in the Qur�an that Zevi would mandate to God whom
to admit to heaven and whom to reject,� said one speaker in Ramallah.</p>

Jews,&nbsp;<br>
torment for the Palestinians</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b><span style="font-style:normal">Occupied
Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh<br>
</span></b>Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day in the Jewish
calendar. Jews, especially the pious, are supposed to spend the day in
introspection, fasting and prayer. In Israel, a particularistic Jewish State
where non-Jews are treated by law as second-class citizens, life comes to a halt
as Jews go to the synagogues to ask the Almighty to forgive their sins against
fellow Jews. (Many Orthodox Jews consider sins against non-Jews as only
forgivable minor transgressions.)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, for non-Jews, especially the four-million-strong
Palestinian population who have not yet been expelled from their ancestral
homeland, the Day of Atonement is effectively a day of torment and great
suffering.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Palestinian towns and villages are sealed off by
trigger-happy Israeli soldiers, ready to shoot any Palestinian daring to leave
his locality. All border crossings from and to the occupied territories are
closed. Even access to hospitals is often denied on Yom Kippur.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In short, millions of Palestinian Muslims and Christians
are forced to endure Yom Kippur in deference to the �imperial race and the
chosen people.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The effects of Yom Kippur-related sanctions on the
Palestinians can be very disastrous. Indeed, scores of Palestinians have died on
previous Yom Kippurs because Israeli soldiers manning roadblocks outside
Palestinian towns wouldn�t let them proceed to hospitals. The soldiers would
only say �sorry, we have orders not to let anybody pass.� Any argument over
the immorality of the orders could lead to the Palestinian getting shot, even
killed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Apart from this, Palestinians are made to feel that their
horizons are seriously narrowed as their life and businesses are forced to come
to a halt just because Jews happened to observe a religious holiday.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�I would like to ask Jews around the world: How would
you react if Jews in the United States or Britain were confined to their
localities and barred from travelling on Christian holidays?� a Palestinian
Christian from Bethlehem asked this writer on 26 September, after Israel imposed
a security blockade on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring Palestinians from
travelling from or to their country.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Asked why the Israeli government resorts to harsh
collective measures against Palestinians whenever there is a Jewish holiday, the
Palestinian from Bethlehem said, �Well, if you want me to be frank with you,
the Israelis don�t recognize our humanity; they think that they are God�s
chosen people and are entitled to superior rights and privileges; this is what
one would call Jewish racism.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Israeli government, for which lying is as essential
as breathing, would claim that its draconian measures against Palestinians
during the duration of Yom Kippur are taken for security reason, an Israeli
mantra whose intonation justifies the unjustifiable.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, the truth of the matter is that stringent
anti-Palestinian measures are not necessarily related to security, as closure of
the West Bank and Gaza on Yom Kippur holidays has been in effect since Israel
occupied the two territories in 1967.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hence, even when the situation is normal, still the
Israelis resort to closing �the areas,� and confining the Palestinians to
their great, open-air internment camps.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This year�s Yom Kippur also witnessed the murder of at
least six Palestinians by the Israeli occupation army.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">According to Palestinian sources, Israeli tanks and
armoured vehicles overran a defenseless refugee camp in Rafah at the southern
edge of the Gaza Strip, shelling with artillery and heavy machine-guns refugee
cottages and shanties.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the process, six civilians were killed, which means
that six families were bereaved, six mothers were widowed and numerous children
were made orphans.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Among the victims were two boys aged 14 and 16.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Jalal Qishta, the father of the second boy, Mahmoud
Qishta, couldn�t find the words to express his bitterness at the wanton Jewish
terror.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�My son, my only son, is now added to the victims of
the bombings in America. I hope the world will pay attention to the victims of
terror here as well. After all, we aren�t children of a lesser God, and
Americans don�t bleed redder than we do.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His nearly distraught mother had this to say.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�They have been slaughtering us like sheep for the past
year. It is a shame that the world is not paying any attention to this
unrelenting carnage. This is an unjust world.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to the six people murdered, Zionist shelling
wounded over 35 other civilians, including a toddler who sustained serious to
critical wounds.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hospital sources in Rafah said at least six of the
injured sustained serious to critical wounds and were in a life-threatening
conditions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On 28 September, four more Palestinians were killed, two
in Hebron, including a ten-year-old boy named Muhammed Tarayra from the village
of Bani Naim, one from Ramallah, and the fourth from the Dheishe refugee camp.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As if the killing and the maiming were not enough,
Israeli army bulldozers, which usually accompany the tanks, were busy destroying
the poor peoples� homes. Altogether, 14 homes were levelled to the ground with
the residents denied the chance to salvage any of their furniture and
belongings.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The new demolitions are added to an estimated 800 homes
that the Israeli army has destroyed since the outbreak of the Palestinian
uprising against Jewish occupation and apartheid.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The wanton destruction, along with the brazen ravaging of
thousands upon thousands of dunums of Palestinian orchards and vineyards, drew
indignant reactions from many parts of the world, save the United States. Former
British Foreign Secretary Ian Gilmor, who visited the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in June, described Israeli persecution of Palestinians as �an affront to
civilization.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The U.S., the main financier and enabler of Israeli-State
terrorism, continued to issue the same platitudinous calls for �restraint on
both sides� while supplying the Jewish State with the latest instruments of
death and destruction.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Meanwhile, most Jews, especially American Zionists who
hold extremist views on the Middle East even by Israeli standards, continue to
bless Israel�s rampage of murder and terror against the tormented
Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And the American administration, and the Congress, just
follows unscrupulously instructions from the Jewish lobby, and the result is
more Palestinian children killed, more Palestinian homes demolished, more
Palestinian orchards destroyed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So the obscenity continues as usual, and the hypocritical
world watches passively.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No wonder the Muslim world hates America so much.</p>

Israeli terrorism</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Occupied Jerusalem - </b>�If the world wants to
understand what happened in New York and Washington on 11 September, the world
must know first what happened to Khadeeja Fatafta in downtown Hebron on 17
September.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Khadeeja Fatafta, 22, and mother of two little children,
was not hurling stones on Israeli occupation soldiers tormenting Palestinian
civilians into subjugation and surrender.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Nor was she taking part in a peaceful demonstration
protesting Israel�s ongoing rampage of murder and terror against a people
whose only crime is their enduring desire to be free. In fact, Fatafta didn�t
even happen to be in a place where �confrontations� between the occupation
army and Palestinian resistors were taking place.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Khadeeja was sitting peaceably outside the Princess Alia
hospital in downtown Hebron, awaiting to see a cardiologist to examine her child
who suffers from a congenital heart anomaly, the occurrence of which doctors say
has increased significantly in Palestine due to the intensive and unbridled use
by the Israeli army of lethal weapons with long-lasting effects.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And suddenly, on 17 September, calamity struck when an
Israeli army sniper stationed on one of the strategic rooftops at Tel al-Rumeida
pulled the trigger; the result was an 800 mm-caliber bullet striking Khadeeja in
the face, plucking out her left eye and causing a deep, wide hollow in the upper
part of her face.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Unconscious and nearly dead, Khadeeja was rushed to Saint
Johns eye hospital in East Jerusalem for treatment. There her calamity was
described as the worst of all the estimated 193 Palestinian civilians who have
lost an eye or two as a result of being hit by Israeli bullets, often fired by
army snipers stationed on strategic rooftops in Palestinian urban centres.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Her treating doctor, Aghlab Khouri, describes
Khadeeja�s case as �the ugliest I�ve ever seen.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Speaking sorrowfully of Khadeeja�s tragedy, Khouri
laments that not only will the young woman be blind for the rest of her life,
but will have to live with serious disfigurement as well.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Khadija�s distraught mother, weeping outside the
hospital, mourns the tragedy that befell her only daughter.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">She asks in a lethargic tone, combining bitterness, anger
and helplessness, �What was her fault; why did they shoot her? May God avenge
my daughter�s calamity. May God destroy Israel, and American as well.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In fact, what happened to Khadeeja is only a small
representative example of what the Palestinian people have been going through in
the past year.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Last week, a Palestinian medical doctor, Hussein Ikdeimat,
was killed in similar circumstances in the same vicinity when he sought to give
first aid to a child who was shot by Israeli snipers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The child survived, but Ikdeimat, 50 years old and a
father of six children, died to be added to the long list of victims of the
American-funded Israeli oppression of a decimated people whose only crime is its
enduring desire to be free from occupation and apartheid.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Two other children had died earlier in similar
circumstances and in the same area, which townspeople have come to call �death
square.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All in all, the Israeli army and paramilitary Jewish
terrorists killed no less than 690 Palestinians in the last eleven months, a
third of them children and minors.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And the injured exceeds 25,000, many, very many, like
Khadeeja Fatafta, with crippling disabilities and handicaps which will stay with
them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Israeli army and government, indeed the heavily armed
fanatic Jewish settlers, and also the media, view the daily Palestinian
calamities blithely, even gleefully.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On 12 September, less than 24 hours after the tragic
disasters in New York and Washington, Israeli defense minister Benyamin
Benalizer boasted that the Israeli army killed 18 Palestinians and the world
didn�t utter a word of protest at the carnage.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He was alluding to the murder of 18 Palestinians in the
city of Jenin on 12 September, when as many as 60 Israeli tanks and several
thousand soldiers rampaged through the town, spreading death and terror
everywhere, taking advantage of the world�s preoccupation with events in the
United States.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Other Israeli spokesmen would only blame the victims,
suggesting that �this is a self-inflicted tragedy that the Palestinians
brought upon themselves,� an unscrupulous claim readily parroted by CNN and
other Zionist-controlled and Zionist-manipulated American media.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Needless to say, Israel�s indescribably wanton terror
and murder, which very often assumes a collective approach and often thinly
conceals genocidal undertones of unmistakable features, triggers deep feelings
of frustration, vindictiveness and hatred, not only toward Israel, the executive
and direct tormentor, but at the United States as well, perceived here as the
ultimate enabler of Israeli oppression and guarantor and sponsor of its
continuity.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Last week, most Palestinians did express genuine sympathy
with the victims of the suicide plane crashes in the United States. However, it
is morally imperative to point out that there was also a feeling permeating in
Palestine, as in the rest of the Arab and Muslim world, that the U.S. reaped
what it sowed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The wanton and brazen embrace by the United States of
Israeli apartheid and colonialism may not justify the deadly terrorist attacks
in the United States. The murder of innocent people can never be justified,
especially by Muslims whose religion teaches them that �killing an innocent
soul is like killing the entire humanity.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, it would be brashly dishonest and crassly stupid
to think that America�s misdeeds in the Middle East, to put it very mildly,
would not lead to equally diabolic reactions such as what we saw in New York and
Washington on 11 September.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It is wisdom�s turn now to mend the mess created so
blithely and insolently by greed and mindless power.</p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;From al-Amal refugee camp, which is subject to
constant Israeli military attacks especially at night, Malika says, &quot;My
child, who is in the fifth grade, insists on holding an onion while sleeping,
and when I try to take it away from him, he shouts and says, �The Israelis
will come and fire gas and I will die.� So, I take my hand back and leave him,
helplessly,&quot; she says.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Fadi has been holding a big onion in his hand for
several months, since the intifada started, even if we were in a place far from
home and the shelling,&quot; she said. &quot;I tried to take him to a
psychiatrist, but our financial situation prevented us from continuing with
these sessions,&quot; she added. &quot;I feel so frightened; he isolates himself
from other children, is always silent and refuses to play with his
brothers.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Tanks near the house<br>
</u></b>In Khan Younis refugee camp, near al-Tuffah Israeli military roadblock,
another child suffers symptoms similar to Fadi's. This child insists on staying
at home in his room. When his parents try to get him out of the house, he says,
&quot;What shall we do about the tank which is pointing at us?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Um Ala` explains that occupation forces at the military
checkpoint carry out provocative actions to frighten the children, such as
pointing the tank towards them and using bad, shocking language. She adds,
&quot;I cannot leave the house; where shall we go? We do not have money to eat;
my husband is unemployed, and we live on what people offer.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Fear from loneliness</u></b><br>
Maha says, &quot;My daughter Riham (7th grade) is terrified of staying at home
alone. Whenever we want to go out without her, she turns everything upside down
and refuses to stay at home without her father or I even though her uncle lives
just downstairs.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maha adds, &quot;Also, our youngest child (5th grade) gets
frightened whenever he hears any sound. We tried to reassure him and offer him
security by talking to him and trying to direct his attention away from the
shelling or firing.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maha says that despite her constant visits to their school
and talks with their teachers, her children find it extremely difficult to
concentrate. The school has described this as a general case for all the
students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b><u>Convulsions and involuntary urination</u></b><br>
Ruwaida describes her five-year-old son's behaviour as &quot;strange&quot;.
Despite her efforts and repeated visits to specialists, her son continues to
have convulsions. He freezes in his place until the shelling ends. The shelling
usually starts after midnight and ends at dawn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ruwaida adds, &quot;The suffering does not end here. My son
Amir who is in the 7th grade urinates involuntarily even when with a group of
people. When he sees that his pants are wet, he starts crying and becomes very
ashamed; this forces him to isolate himself in his room.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She said that her children's performance at school has
decreased considerably, since they so easily lose their concentration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mervat, who also says her children's level at school has
decreased dramatically, says, &quot;All my children are constantly in fear and
refuse to leave me for one minute; they have nightmares almost every night and
wake up extremely frightened.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>The parents� and specialists� role<br>
</u></b>Education specialist Wafa Musa, from the Palestinian Working Women�s
organization for development says, &quot;Children suffer from psychological
reactions which are expressed in their ideas, movements and playing.&quot; Musa
adds, &quot;Children react to what they see on television and their daily life.
If these reactions continue for a long time, they will form an obstacle in the
face of children's growth of mental and physical abilities, impeding the child's
accommodation with his surroundings.&quot;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><b>Occupied
Jerusalem -</b> Muslim Ulema (religious scholars) throughout Palestine have
issued an edict prohibiting Muslim States from joining the American-led crusade
against Afghanistan or any other Muslim countries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">A
fatwa or religious ruling issued recently by the League of Palestinian Ulema,
which represents over 500 religious scholars and academics in Palestine, stated
that &quot;it is amply clear in light of the Holy Qur�an and the traditions of
our Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) that it is inadmissible for Muslims to
enter into alliance with non-Muslims against fellow Muslims.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">The
edict cited evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah (the sayings, actions and
silences of the Prophet) to that effect. It warned Muslims against falling into
the trap of fighting and killing fellow Muslims under the rubric of
&quot;fighting terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Several
similar fatwas have been issued throughout the Muslim world, all forbidding
Muslims from joining the expected American campaign against Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Sheikh
Ibrahim Zaid al-Kilani, a prominent Islamic figure in Jordan, had also issued a
strongly worded statement admonishing Arab regimes against &quot;joining ranks
with the disbelievers against fellow Muslims.&quot; He invoked the Qur�anic
verse that states that &quot;whoever joins them (the disbelievers) is one of
them.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Sheikh
Nayef Rajoub, a member of the Palestine League of Ulema, also criticized
&quot;the harrowing to join the American drum-beaters against our Afghani
brothers.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">&quot;When
somebody is accused, evidence is presented and he is prosecuted in a court of
law, and if he is found innocent, he is acquitted and declared innocent, and if
found guilty, he is sentenced and punished. However, America, driven by the
hysteria of recent events, wants to shed Muslim blood indiscriminately, and
Muslims must not take part in this act of aggression.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Rajoub,
brother to Palestinian Authority Preventive Security Chief Jebril Rajoub, also
questioned the motives of the American crusade.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">&quot;Why
haven't we seen a similar international coalition against Jewish terrorism which
killed hundreds and wounded tens of thousands in the past 12 months? Do the
Americans bleed redder blood, or are we children of a lesser God?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Rajoub
further asked, &quot;If the victims of the recent tragedy in New York had been
Arab or Muslim, would the world have paid much attention to their
calamity?&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Muslim
organizations and Muslims in general have ostensibly sincerely expressed their
revulsion at and condemnation of the suicide plane crashes in the U.S.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, most Muslims also blamed the American embrace of
Israeli apartheid and colonialism as the root cause for terrorism against the
United States.</p>
