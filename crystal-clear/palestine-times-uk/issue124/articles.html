<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">These
are difficult times for Muslims worldwide but in particular for those of them
that live in Europe and America. Coming days may be as difficult for the
Palestinians, whose cries of pain�out of necessity�need not be heard if the
Americans are to wage their war of vengeance. Inasmuch as the Palestinians did
not need the Gulf war and were victims of Saddam Hussein�s invasion of Kuwait,
they definitely did not need the atrocities committed in America on 11 September
and are very likely to suffer as a result.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB">As for the Muslims in the West, although it would seem as if we have been
through this before several times already (during the Gulf war, in the aftermath
of the first World Trade Center bombing, and in the aftermath of the Oklahoma
bombing), this is a crisis of unprecedented dimensions. The symbols of Western
capitalism and U.S. military might have been attacked, several thousands have
been killed and the renowned U.S. systems of intelligence and reconnaissance
have been humiliated and discredited. Worse still, the suspect is a shadowy,
elusive figure that takes shelter in a country suffocated by sanctions and
ravished by war and tribal strife.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">While
most Muslims around the world condemn and regret the recent attack on innocent
civilians in the United States, the media coverage of the unfolding events since
Tuesday, 11 September has, wittingly or otherwise, been agitating Western public
opinion against Islam and the Muslims. Muslim mosques and schools have come
under attack, prompting some schools to send their pupils home and close their
doors until further notice. Muslims in America have been advised to lock
themselves in lest they are attacked as they walk the streets. The situation is
less serious in Europe though several incidents of abuse and attacks have been
reported in the U.K. Muslim women in particular, conspicuous by their
head-dresses and vulnerable by their feminism, have been easy targets. One is
tempted to think that what George Bush, Jr. and Tony Blair like to call the
�civilized world� is not so civilized after all.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">The
remarks made by George W. Bush on several occasions, despite his assurances to
the Muslims that this was not a war against them or their religion, included
references to a �crusade�, and the �civilized world�, the �free
world� and �democracy� being attacked by the �evil ones.� Such remarks
have not been helpful at all and have been criticized by many people both inside
America and across Europe. If the West is waging a crusade, are we to compare it
with the one Europe waged against the world of Islam ten centuries ago? If the
West is the civilized world, are the Muslims the savages? If democracy in the
West is what is under attack, why is the U.S. sponsoring and protecting a bunch
of despotic regimes across the Muslim region against the wishes of the people
who are struggling for democracy and freedom? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">The
Israelis and their Zionist propaganda worldwide immediately seized the pain and
sorrow of the American people as an opportunity to agitate the world against
Islam and the Muslims. Former as well as present political figures were given
ample space in the media to tell the world of their expertise regarding
�Islamic terrorism.� The Palestinian people�s struggle against occupation,
which is a legitimate right in accordance with United Nations Charter, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all UN Security Council resolutions
adopted on the issue since Israel was founded in 1948, was being equated and
likened to the atrocities of 11 September. Some Israeli figures, including
former Prime Minister Netanyahu, could not conceal their delight because this
attack on America was a golden opportunity for Israel to mobilize the world
against Islam and to regain some of the points it lost since the Palestinian
intifada erupted a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB">Without evidence of Netanyahu�s involvement and without much talk about
his background or likely motivation, right from the first day, Bin Laden was
presented to the world as the symbol of �Islamic terrorism� or to put it
more mildly �Islamic extremism.� To bridge the gap between terrorism (or
extremism) and Islam, the most frequently used term to describe the Bin Laden
phenomenon, not only by people in the media but also by prominent politicians
and decision makers, has been Islamic fundamentalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Academics know quite well the danger of applying this term to Islam
because</span> to the majority of liberal or mainline Christians
�fundamentalism� is pejorative or derogatory. Communal manifestation or
personal observance of religious practice or symbols can easily be labeled as
�fundamentalism.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm">No doubt, such treatment is
exclusive to Islam and its followers. No other religion is labeled in the same
manner when some or any of its followers are suspected of embroilment in acts of
terrorism. You do not hear the terms �Jewish terrorism� or �Christian
terrorism� or �Hindu terrorism� or �Sikh terrorism.� One important
factor compounds the problem in the case of Islam. The United States of America
and some of its allies in Europe are not liked in many parts of the Muslim world
because of their foreign policies and what is seen as their imperialist
attitude. The U.S. in particular is the most hated country in the Muslim world
thanks to its unconditional, uncritical support for Israel, its role in
perpetuating the suffering of the Iraqi people and the presence of its troops on
Islam�s holiest soil in Arabia. It is undeniable that the calamity that struck
the United States on 11 September may have been a source of joy for some Muslims
whose hatred for America prevents them from recognizing the savagery and
inhumanity of this attack.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm">U.S. policy makers may not be
oblivious to this fact. They probably know, only too well, that if Muslims were
actually responsible for the catastrophe, it is U.S. foreign policy that breeds
and provokes such elements that are willing to go as far as killing themselves
to inflict pain and humiliation on the United States. The leader of world
democracy and protector of international law and human rights is seen by many
Muslims in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa as supporting
dictatorships and military junta that resist political reform and that are up to
their ears in corruption. The real tragedy is that very few Americans know how
their country is perceived and what their policy makers are doing to the rest of
the world. Rather than asking questions about the failure of America in
protecting its citizens from the menace of terrorism and seeking to call to
account senior U.S. officials all the way from the President downwards, many
Americans are rallying behind their government to launch a war against
�Islamic terrorism.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm">In light of this feverish and
indiscriminate mobilization, the Muslim world is emerging as the enemy
Huntington once depicted. Unless sensible people in America and Western Europe
start speaking out against such mobilization, what Huntington prophesized may
just be realized. We should all do our best so that a war against terrorism does
not turn into a clash of civilizations. A sensible war against terrorism may be
won, but a war against Islam can never be won.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm">As for the Palestinians,
something similar to what happened in the early 1990s may be in the making. The
Gulf war paved the way for putting an end to the first intifada and the U.S. war
against Afghanistan may lead to putting an end to the current one. In an
unprecedented move, the U.S. administration used its verbal muscles to pressure
Israeli Prime Minister Sharon into agreeing to a ceasefire that had earlier been
agreed to by Yasser Arafat, also in response to U.S. demands. Ironically, this
shows, only too well, that the Americans can dictate to the Israelis what they
want when they deem it necessary to do so. Just as the Americans were eager to
build a coalition against Iraq in 1990, they are now so eager to build a
coalition against �terrorism.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Americans know well that if Muslim governments are not on board, such a
coalition will have no chance of succeeding.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm">Like other Arab leaders, and in
contrast with his position ten years ago, Yasser Arafat has pledged support for
the U.S.A. He has even placed all his resources under the command of President
George W. Bush. The best Arafat can do under the prevalent circumstances is
settle with the Israelis so as for U.S. strategists and decision makers to have
the piece of mind they need in executing their war, a war which many Muslims
fear will not be waged solely against bin Laden and the Taliban but rather
against whatever America deems to be a threat to its interests and the interests
of its alleged strategic ally, Israel, in the Arab and Muslim regions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:1.0cm">However, an imminent settlement
is unlikely to be permanent. Palestinians have tried this before. The symptoms
of the chronic Palestinian issue are impossible to do away with. Only hours
after both Arafat and Sharon agreed to the ceasefire, clashes between
Palestinians and settlers resulted in fatalities on both sides. The Palestinians
simply cannot coexist with Jewish settlers who live on land seized from them by
force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Israelis, on the other
hand, cannot do away with their contempt for the Arabs whose presence next door
is a continuous reminder to them of the crime they have committed against them.</p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="center"><b><i>Khalid Amayreh</i><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Contrary to Israeli propaganda that portrayed
Palestinians as being �gleeful� and �jubilant� over the 11 September
devastating suicidal plane-crash attacks in New York and Washington, most
Palestinians actually expressed genuine feelings of shock and sadness at the
terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The sheer magnitude of the tragedy seemed to have made it
almost humanly impossible not to be horrified at and by what happened. This was
true all over the world, and the Palestinians were no exception. Hence, reports
caricaturing Palestinians as celebrating the mega-tragedy should probably be
viewed as part of the unrelenting public relations showdown between Israel and
the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Palestinian Authority did condemn in the strongest
terms the terrorist acts in the U.S., voicing willingness to join in the
international efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Moreover, PA chairman Yasser Arafat responded positively
to an urgent request by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to declare a
cease-fire with Israel, which Arafat did and the cease-fire was more or less
observed by the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Furthermore, the PA and some affiliated NGOs made
strenuous efforts to counter and refute malicious Israeli propaganda aimed at
tarnishing the Palestinians� image.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Palestinian ministry of health organized a
blood-donation campaign throughout the occupied territories on behalf of the
victims in the U.S., and many Palestinians, especially in Ramallah (where a
sizeable Palestinian-American community lives) and Jerusalem, held several
candle-lighting ceremonies, highlighting sympathy and solidarity with the U.S.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And in a gesture of solidarity with the American people,
Palestinian schoolchildren also stood silent for five minutes last week.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Nonetheless, it was amply clear that there was a great
deal of ambivalence toward the tragedy among most ordinary Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For while virtually all Palestinians were shocked by the
utter horror of the tragedy, many, probably most Palestinians thought that that
the U.S. was only reaping what it had been sowing for many, many years.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�We express our deep sympathy with the victims and
their families; Islam does not accept this blind violence against innocent
civilians. However, it is amply clear that the unjust policies of the American
government were responsible, at least in part, for what happened,� said Hamas
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, commenting on the terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Coming from a people who for so long have been (and
continue to be) tormented by American policies, this feeling seems to be quite
natural.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This ambivalence was expressed in mosques throughout the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, with Juma�a (Friday) speakers, denouncing the
terrorist attacks as �inhuman and unjustifiable from an Islamic
perspective,� while at the same time blaming �criminal American policy�
toward Muslims, especially the Palestinians, for making the tragedy inevitable.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�Let the world make no mistake about it; Muslims
condemn in the strongest terms this enormous tragedy in America. We are not
barbarians; we are victims of Western and American barbarity,� said Nayef
Rajoub, Imam of the Grand Mosque in Dura during the Juma�a sermon on 21
September.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He added, though, �while American enabling of Israeli
occupation and terror does not justify the catastrophe in Washington and New
York, it undoubtedly makes such things inevitable.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�As you sow, so will you reap. America is responsible
for the extermination of millions of Muslims and non-Muslims around the world;
America is responsible for killing a million Iraqi children; American allowed
the State of oppression (Israel) to torment and enslave our people for the last
50 years; America made every effort to impede the realization of democracy and
liberty in the Arab-Muslim world, and now America is harvesting what it has been
sowing for years. We hope this will awaken America and make it use its power and
resources humanely,� said Rajoub before some 6,000 believers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Other Islamists seized on the word �crusades,� in
reference to the launching of such against terrorism, according to President
Bush.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Some Muslim preachers, even journalists, considered the
use of the word �crusades� more than just a slip of the tongue or a poor
choice of words.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sheikh Muhammed Hussein, Imam and preacher at the Aqsa
Mosque, said �Bush was only spelling out what he thought and what he felt.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The use of the word �crusades� by President Bush, and
despite his swift retraction and clarification, hardened popular reactions
toward the current crisis.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Jerusalem, the Mufti of Palestine, Sheikh Ikrema Sabri,
declared that it would be inadmissible from the Shariah (Islamic law)
perspective for Muslims, States and individuals to join the U.S.-led campaign
against fellow Muslims, unless it is absolutely clear that Bin Laden is the
perpetrator.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A similar ruling was issued by the Mufti of Egypt, Dr.
Muhammed Hussein Tantawi, and Sheikh Yusef al-Qaradawi.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Both demanded that the United States produce irrefutable
evidence incriminating Bin Laden before Muslims States can decide whether to
join the American-led campaign.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These rulings reflect strong feelings throughout the
Muslim world that the U.S. does not have solid proof that Bin Laden is indeed
responsible for the 11 September carnage and that the U.S. wants only to destroy
Afghanistan to satiate the American people�s thirst for revenge.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Needless to say, this feeling is not confined to ordinary
Muslims, but is actually expressed by some Muslim leaders as well, such as
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, a long-time ally of the United States.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mubarak has repeatedly urged the United States to produce
absolute evidence linking Bin Laden to the attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon before embarking on a destructive war against Afghanistan, a
country already decimated by 20 years of internecine wars.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This, and the likelihood that many innocent people will
be killed and injured in any American-led attacks on Afghanistan, would turn
collective Muslim feelings decidedly against the United States.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And in the words of one political analyst: �Instead of
one Bin Laden now, we will then have thousands like him.�</p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="center"><b><i>Andy Clarno</i><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;On Tuesday, 11 September, I was walking down the
street with two friends in Gaza City when I got a phone call from my father. His
usually calm voice sounded deeply shaken as he told me the news: two airplanes
had crashed into the World Trade Center and another into the Pentagon. The TV
was reporting that a Palestinian group had claimed responsibility. All of a
sudden, the world came to a standstill. In shock and disbelief, we rushed to the
nearest television. For hours we sat in front of CNN and al-Jazeera. With the
rest of the world, we watched in horror as the buildings collapsed and felt an
unexplainable combination of fear, disgust, anger, frustration, sadness and
confusion.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Outside, Gaza was eerily quiet. In one of the most
densely populated places on earth, you could hear a pin drop. For two to three
days, Palestinians were glued to their television sets, except in Jenin and
Jericho where they were under attack by Israeli forces. The only thing that
anyone talked about was the attack in the United States: the possible
perpetrators, the numerous causes, and the likely effects. Most of all, people
expressed an overwhelming sadness and a deep sense of pain. They were outraged
and angry about the attacks on American civilians. They said that these attacks
were horrible and should never have happened.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Immediately after the attacks, the press began to claim
that the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) or the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) had carried out the attacks. The
absurdity of such claims seemed to escape the commentators. But Palestinians
knew better: these groups are so small and disorganized that they could not
possibly have carried out such a large-scale operation. Besides, all of their
efforts are directed towards resisting Israeli military aggression and
challenging the ongoing colonization of Palestine and the racist oppression of
Palestinians by Israel.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Soon reports claimed that Palestinians were celebrating
in the streets and handing out candy to children. A single clip of a few people
claiming victory in the streets of Nablus had been repeatedly broadcast on
American and European television for the first week after the calamity. I can
assure you that this was a rare and isolated incident. There was absolutely no
celebration in the Gaza Strip. I called friends throughout the West Bank to find
out from them what was happening in their cities. They said that there had been
one or two random shots fired into the air, but that the atmosphere was one of
horror and sorrow rather than celebration.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These attacks are not something that Palestinians can
celebrate. On the contrary, most Palestinians had a powerful and spontaneous
reaction of disgust at the bombings and empathy with the people who suffered
from the attacks. They know exactly what it feels like to be a civilian
population under attack. For the last 34 years, the Palestinians have been
living under a brutal Israeli military occupation that uses terror to control
the occupied population. For the past year, the Israeli military has escalated
the amount of violence it uses against the Palestinian people: fighter planes,
helicopter gun-ships, tanks and heavy assault weapons are regularly used against
the civilian population of Palestine. These attacks are rarely called terrorism
because they are carried out by the Israeli government rather than by a
secretive and mysterious organization. But they are intended to terrorize the
population and to instill a sense of fear that will suffocate the will to resist
Israeli oppression. The Palestinians recognized the attacks on American
civilians as a form of terrorism no different than that used against them by the
Israeli military. They know very well the fear that Americans are experiencing
right now, and they feel a great deal of empathy with the American pain. On
Friday night, 14 September, in Jerusalem, Palestinians held a candlelight vigil
in memory of the victims of the attack in the United States. Although the vigil
received no press coverage, CNN and the BBC continue to broadcast the clip of
Palestinians celebrating the attacks. But the empathy is real; the Palestinians
feel a connection right now with the American people that they want to express.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There is another reason that Palestinians cannot
celebrate: they are literally running for their lives. Palestine has been under
siege and the world does not know about it because all of the media attention
has been on the United States. Israeli officials have openly stated that this is
a golden opportunity for Israel to annihilate the Palestinian resistance. That
is the word that is most often repeated by Israeli government officials:
opportunity. Now that the world has turned its attention to the United States
and Afghanistan, Israeli military officials feel that they have a freer hand to
do as they please in the occupied Palestinian territories. And they have
definitely not wasted the opportunity. Israeli forces have besieged almost every
Palestinian city during the week following the U.S. attacks. On Tuesday, 11
September, the very same day as the attack on the United States, 15 Israeli
tanks, along with attack helicopters and ground troops, rolled into the
Palestinian city of Jenin. Nearly a week later, they were still there. On
Wednesday, 12 September, 22 tanks with ground and air support besieged Jericho.
Nablus remains surrounded and under fire.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The current escalation of the siege against the
Palestinians has two primary aims. First of all, it is an attempt to crush the
Palestinian resistance and instill fear in the Palestinian people. On Saturday
night, helicopters and tanks shelled every Palestinian police and security
building in the south-west part of Ramallah. The Israeli military is attempting
to finally and brutally smash the centres of Palestinian resistance. But the
buildings that belonged to the security forces made up roughly 5% of all the
buildings that the Israelis shelled that night. The other 95% were civilian
homes, stores and offices. These attacks were clearly meant to create terror
among the Palestinian people and to destroy their will to resist.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But there is another, more appalling reason behind the
Israeli assault. Sharon and his cabinet are once again attempting to provoke the
Palestinians to respond with violence. By backing the Palestinians into a corner
and assaulting them from all sides, Sharon is hoping that someone will lash out
with a vicious bombing in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. It is sick to think that Sharon
would want such a thing to happen to his own people, but it is not a new policy.
For years, the Israeli military has used assassinations and assaults on
civilians to provoke a violent Palestinian reaction. This policy has been pushed
to new limits during the current intifada. In fact, the intifada began as a
response to a very purposeful provocation by Sharon when he, along with 200
soldiers and a team of journalists, entered the Haram al-Sharif compound,
asserting Israeli sovereignty over an extremely important and sensitive Islamic
holy site in Jerusalem. It now appears that Sharon is currently pushing for an
immense reaction from Palestinians. Such an attack would provide the Israeli
government with the perfect symbol to condemn Palestinians as terrorists, no
different than the group that carried out the attacks in the United States.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In recent weeks, Israeli officials have been doing
everything possible to brand the Palestinians as terrorists in the eyes of the
world. Sharon and other officials have repeatedly referred to Arafat as
�another Bin Laden.� The public relations firms hired by Israel have
circulated the images of Palestinians celebrating in Nablus after the initial
reports of an attack on the Pentagon. Palestinian groups were even accused of
committing the attacks. Last week, the French Ambassador to Israel declared that
terror attacks on Israel must be condemned, but that there is a difference
between those attacks and the attacks in the U.S. The Zionist press and
establishment immediately branded the Ambassador as an �anti-Semite� in
order to de-legitimize and silence him. All of this must be seen in the context
of a heated phone conversation between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon
on the Friday following the U.S. attacks. Sharon demanded that the Palestinian
Authority and Syria be officially and publicly excluded from the American-led
coalition to fight terrorism. He stated that these two governments support and
harbor terrorists. Instead of being encouraged to join the coalition, he said,
they should be branded as enemies and destroyed by the coalition. But Bush faces
a dilemma: he desperately wants the Arab States to join his coalition, but they
have agreed to do so only if the coalition focuses on Bin Laden and not on the
Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">During recent weeks, the Palestinian/Israeli conflict has
become a symbol in the construction of two major global struggles. On Tuesday,
11 September, Palestinian groups were fingered from the very start as being
responsible for the terror attacks in the United States. Ever since that time,
the Israeli government and the Zionist-controlled media have not stopped in
their efforts to condemn Palestinian resistance as inherently terrorist. They
want the Palestinian/Israeli conflict to become a central symbol in the
developing global struggle against terrorism. By branding Palestinians as
terrorists, the Israelis are attempting to align themselves with the forces of
moral authority in the war between civilization and terror. Israel is doing
everything in its power to convince the U.S. to declare the Palestinian
Authority, and along with it the Palestinian people, an enemy. They are waging a
powerful campaign to associate Arafat with Bin Laden and the forces of terror in
the world. If they manage to do so, and to isolate the Palestinians as
terrorists, Israel will have global support for its efforts to annihilate the
Palestinian resistance.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On the other hand, one week before the attacks on the
U.S., the Palestinian-Israeli conflict stood out as a key symbol in the global
struggle against racism and apartheid. The NGO forum at the World Conference
Against Racism made great strides in demonstrating to the world the fact that
Israel is a colonial, apartheid State. Over 300 NGOs from around the world
released a strong declaration that highlighted the racist nature of the Israeli
State. They declared:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�The Palestinian people are one such people currently
enduring a colonialist, discriminatory military occupation that violates their
fundamental human right of self-determination�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�We declare and call for an immediate end to the
Israeli systematic perpetration of racist crimes, including war crimes, acts of
genocide and ethnic cleansing (as defined in the Statute of the International
Criminal Court), including uprooting by military attack, and the imposition of
any and all restrictions and measures on the population to make life so
difficult that the only option is to leave the area, and State terrorism against
the Palestinian people, recognizing that all of these methods are designed to
ensure the continuation of an exclusively Jewish State with a Jewish majority
and the expansion of its borders to gain more land, driving out the indigenous
Palestinian population�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�We declare that this alien domination and subjugation
with the denial of territorial integrity amounts to colonialism, which denies
the fundamental right of self-determination, independence and freedom for
Palestinians...</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�We declare Israel as a racist, apartheid State in
which Israel�s brand of apartheid as a crime against humanity has been
characterized by separation and segregation, dispossession, restricted land
access, denationalization, bantustanization and inhumane acts�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�Appalled by the inhumane acts perpetrated in the
maintenance of this new form of apartheid regime through the Israeli State war
on civilians, including military attacks, torture, arbitrary arrests and
detention, the imposition of severe restrictions on movement (curfews,
imprisonment and besiegement of towns and villages), and systematic collective
punishment, including economic strangulation and deliberate impoverishment,
denial of the right to food and water, the right to an adequate standard of
living, the right to housing, the right to education and the right to work.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Palestinians are on the brink of what seems like
utter destruction at the hands of the Israeli military. The current moment is
critical. If Israel is able to frame public discussion of the conflict and to
declare the Palestinians as terrorists who must be dealt with accordingly, then
the future for Palestine is certainly bleak. We must remain focused on
demonstrating to the world the racist nature of the Israeli State. We must
articulate the Palestinian struggle with the growing movement against racism,
colonialism and global capitalism. The only hope that Palestinians have shown
over the last few months has been in response to the NGO forum. The images of
60,000 people in the streets of Durban demonstrating against Israeli apartheid
gave strength to millions of Palestinians living under occupation. In the wake
of the terrible attacks in the United States, the Palestinians cannot afford to
allow Israel to control the public discourse. Palestine can either become a
symbol in the struggle against terror or a symbol in the struggle against
oppression. Now, perhaps more than ever, it is absolutely imperative that the
racist, colonial nature of the Israeli State be openly and publicly discussed
throughout the United States and Europe.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;A six-year-old
  Palestinian girl kneeled and nervously, yet gently laid a flower to join
  hundreds of other flowers, banners and candles in a small vigil held in
  Jerusalem to commemorate the death of thousands of Americans in New York,
  Pennsylvania and Washington.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The little girl rushed back, bashful, and held her
  mother�s hand and both stood quietly gazing at a burning candle.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">At the scene, only a few reporters gathered, none of them
  represented foreign agencies; they were all Arabs and Palestinians.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">But Americans who witnessed the world weeping for their
  victims never learned of the deep sympathy that was felt by many Palestinians
  across Palestine and around the world.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">However, they did see, with horror and dismay, a few
  Palestinian children dancing on an old car, two men shooting in the air and an
  old woman with thick spectacles waving her arms, in celebration of the
  attacks, we were told.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Every major American news network prides itself with
  having its own exclusive footage and reporting. When it came to the scene of
  the dozen dancing Palestinians, they were willing to share the report, which
  was syndicated all over the world, and aired endlessly.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A quick conclusion was drawn: Palestinians dance on the
  pain of Americans.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Even if the short report was accurate, a few kids and an
  old woman hardly represent the Palestinian population, which consists of
  millions of people, tens of thousands of them are also American citizens.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">If your grief and pain allow you to roll the tape of
  memory a few years back, try to remember New York City following the Gulf War
  in 1991.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The American army had just returned from a mission in the
  Middle East. Former President George Bush described the nature of the mission
  once on TV, so bluntly and in simple terms, to &quot;bomb Iraq back to the
  Stone Age.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Mission accomplished. The American army led the allied
  forces in the region and bombed Iraq for months and killed with no remorse as
  the whole world watched, and as all Americans watched, the same way they
  watched the World Trade Center being levelled to the ground.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Those killed in Iraq were mostly civilians, innocent men
  and women, not any more or less innocent than the New Yorkers who fell to
  their deaths while sipping their coffee on a seemingly beautiful morning.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">American soldiers returned home with hands covered in the
  blood of civilians, after they bombarded every city, town and village in Iraq,
  south and north. They used every weapon; they experimented with the highest
  killing technology against a largely defenseless nation; they bombed, killed
  and sometimes ridiculed their victims.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">They were seen on TV loading warplanes with missiles that
  read &quot;Say goodbye, Ahmed,&quot; &quot;Happy Ramadan&quot; and &quot;Say
  hi to Allah.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">But when they returned from their mission, they were not
  booed, nor were rotten eggs thrown at them; they were celebrated. As far as
  America was concerned, &quot;our boys and girls&quot; were heroes.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">And right in New York, where now half of the city stands
  in dust and rubble, hundreds of thousands took to the streets, lined up with
  happy faces, and sang the �Star Spangled Banner� for the returning chaps;
  they cheered and chanted, &quot;USA, USA.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Elsewhere in the United States, millions of people
  celebrated the victory; unlike the Palestinians, where only a dozen kids and
  an old woman rushed to the streets to celebrate the killing of Americans,
  nearly every American newspaper, TV station, millions of people, their
  representatives, young and old danced for the death of Iraqis.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Then, like now, Americans were told that it was a battle
  between good and evil; the good has won.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Iraqis might not have been able to watch the celebrations
  in the United States; by that time, their houses were rubble, their dearest
  possessions were sold in the black market to buy some bread and milk, and
  their electricity was cut off, for it was, like their water supplies,
  hospitals, schools and every thing else, &quot;bombed back to the Stone
  Age.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The attacks on the United States were horrid; humanity
  was in a shambles when some people thought they had the right to take the
  lives of others as an expression of political views, likely social or perhaps
  religious ones.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">But the attack lasted for several hours. The Congress
  three days later assigned $40 billion for emergency funds to rebuild the
  country, to aid the victims and to secure the country against future attacks.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">But the Palestinian tragedy has lasted much more than a
  few hours; it has lasted for generations.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">For 53 years now, Palestinians have been subjected to
  some of the most notorious military police ever used; for 53 years they were
  forced to live in concentration camps, to drink polluted water, to have their
  loved ones killed, their homes razed, their futures shattered, deprived of all
  God-given rights and even UN-given rights. They were forced to flee for their
  lives from one place to another; they were imprisoned, tortured and
  assassinated.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Not one day in the calendar passes without Palestinians
  citing a massacre or two. They go to the streets to protest the killing of a
  child; they return home carrying another after being shot while protesting.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You might think: I am already overwhelmed by my own
  grief, why should I worry about yours?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The answer is simple. Every bullet that killed a
  Palestinian was &quot;Made in the USA&quot;, every shell, missile and tank was
  &quot;Made in the USA.&quot; Every massacre was financed by America.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When 3,000 Palestinians were killed in the refugee camps
  of Beirut in 1982, the killers left the camps with piles of skinned bodies,
  butchered and raped women, and thousands of empty bullet shells, also Made in
  the USA.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Even the bulldozers that tried to hide the crimes in mass
  graves as the killers departed were supplied by the United States.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Since the creation of the State of Israel in occupied
  Arab land in 1948, the United States has paid more than $125 billion to
  finance the Israeli army, to construct its illegal settlements and to aid a
  racist State that sustains itself at the expense of a subdued population.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Just two days before the attacks on New York and
  Washington, DC, President George W. Bush decreed that the fact that Israel is
  using U.S. supplied arms to assassinate Palestinians does not violate the U.S.
  policy on arms exports.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">After all of this, unlike what you would expect, only a
  dozen children and an old woman rushed to the streets to celebrate the death
  of Americans.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Despite all of this, most Palestinians mourned the death
  of Americans and were able to comprehend the tragedy, for they have been
  living the tragedy for decades.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Unlike the millions who celebrated the
  &quot;victory&quot; against Iraq in 1991, Palestinians didn�t parade in the
  streets; they didn�t chant, &quot;Palestine, Palestine;&quot; they did not
  raise coloured balloons and break champagne bottles, but rather they stood in
  lines in Ramallah and in Gaza, cities that have been devastated by
  American-made weapons, and donated blood.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The six-year-old Palestinian girl at the vigil finally
  went home with her mother. Their trip to Ramallah from Jerusalem, a trip of
  half an hour, would take hours because of the Israeli military checkpoints.
  Nonetheless, they decided to come and show solidarity with the American
  victims and their families.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Close to them stood many Israeli soldiers, gazing with
  suspicion at the mourning family as they tried to find their way home.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The little girl, who is forbidden to carry a Palestinian
  flag, held a small American flag and appeared enthusiastic for the idea that
  no soldiers rushed to take her flag away.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Back in the West Bank town of Jenin, thousands of
  Palestinians desperately tried to defend their community, as the Israeli army
  bombarded their homes and killed 11 people in a raid that lasted several days.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The helicopters are back,&quot; screamed a
  Palestinian teenager as he was armed with a slingshot and a pocket filled with
  rocks. The people began running in panic to nearby alleyways. Two
  American-made Apache helicopters emerged from behind the hill and showered the
  fleeing residents with automatic rifle bullets, American-made bullets.</p>

all began more than 52 years ago when Arab nations sold Palestine to marauding
Jews from Europe and America who came to the land of Milk and Honey to pillage,
plunder and massacre the native inhabitants.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">At the time, the natives were under the British Mandate
and were not allowed to have any weapons at all, not even a pistol. Anyone
caught with any kind of gun would be thrown in prison for an undetermined length
of time. Thus when the heavily armed Jewish invaders stormed into peaceful
Palestine, the natives were not prepared<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>or equipped to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It was then that Jews began their campaign of terror and
slaughter. Whole villages were wiped out. Women and children, babies and the
elderly were brutally killed. Palestinians were driven out of their homes and
forced to leave all their worldly possessions behind. Many thought that the
scourge would pass and that they would return home. Thinking this, they kept the
keys to their houses buried in treasure chests or deep within their aching
hearts.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There was a feeble Arab attempt to help the Palestinians
but the British and the Jews made sure that such attempts were foiled. As a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>result, nearly a million Palestinian refugees flooded to other parts of
Palestine. Some crossed over into Syria, Lebanon or Jordan. Life was never easy
for Palestinians who lived within their occupied country or those who fled to
neighboring ones.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Today, 52 years afterwards, Intifadas later, Arab leaders
still watch unconcerned as Palestinians are slaughtered. They watched others
murder their Arabs counterparts in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>and in 1990. They were spectators to the civil war in Lebanon and when
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 in order to destroy the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Israel re-invented the excuse that it was for security. But the
purpose was to create a puppet-regime of pro-Western Maronite Christian Lebanese
that would cater to Israeli demands. Major targets of the Israeli invasion were
Palestinian refugee camps, many of which were totally desecrated. An estimated
19,085 people were killed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Then in September 1982, after the PLO had withdrawn from
Lebanon, the Israelis aided the massacre of more than 3,000 to 3,500 men, women
and children at the Sabra-Shatila refugee camps.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Israeli soldiers surrounded the camps and sent in troops
from the fascist Lebanese Christian party known as the Phalange. For 36 hours
while Israelis watched, the killing continued. Some Israelis disguised
themselves as Phalanges and physically took part in the slaughter of the
innocents.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On January 17, 1991 again, Arab and Muslim nations
watched as foreign forces mercilessly bombed and devastated Iraq. More than
140,000 people died. The sanctions have taken a further enormous toll of around
5000-6000 lives a month. Most of the fatalities are infants. And even more than
this, the intricate infrastructure of a civilization dating back to the eons of
early mankind was destroyed.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">That Arab/Muslim countries aided and abetted the assault
on another Arab country is beyond belief. That Arab and Muslim countries helped
foreign invaders to bomb and kill innocent civilians in beyond comprehension.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And now the world is asked by a war monger and the son of
a warlord to support America�s �crusade� against terrorism. According to
President George W. Bush, nations are either �with� the Americans or
�against� them.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">All the Arab and Muslim countries will feign concern and
disunited, will join a new coalition led by the American aggressors against the
Arab nations, against Islam, against one another.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yes, Bush told the world that this is a crusade. It is
not a crusade against terrorism because the real terrorist is not Osama Ben
Laden who has given up all his worldly possessions and the comforts of an easy
life to plot and plan the attacks on American installations, thereby taking the
lives of thousands of innocent victims. Ben Laden would not wage a war on women
and children. Israeli Prime Minister Sharon would. He has a proven track record
for atrocities against unarmed civilians. He practices murder on a daily basis
in Occupied Palestine. He has the blood of more than 20,000 people on his hands
as Israeli Defense Minister when his army invaded Lebanon in 9182.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He has molded the word �terrorism� as a pejorative
one that describes all acts committed against Israel and the U.S. What the
Palestinians are doing are not acts of terrorism but the resistance to the
occupation of their land by a cruel tyrannical foreign power. What Israel is
doing is waging a war against the innocents, against women, children, elderly.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Let us celebrate then the shame of our defeats as our
victories are only those won by Palestinian infants casting<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>stones before being martyred by the invincible enemy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let us once again watch Americans and their coalition tear
us apart, bomb our countrysides, destroy the fabric of our lives, push us to the
depths of despair, and plunge us into abject poverty. As one member of our body
bleeds and suffers, so does the rest of our body. United we could have stood,

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Certainly, the attacks on the United States have
roots. As an Arab, I understand why so many Arabs and Muslims hate the U.S. and
look at it as a power of evil. The U.S. is being accused of robbing the wealth
of the Arabs and insisting on dominating the Arab countries, particularly the
Gulf States. It is also labeled as a supporter of Arab and Muslim dictatorships
that have no respect for basic human rights. But above all, the U.S. is the
prime supporter of Israel, which is considered a strange cancerous body in the
area. The U.S. extends economic, political, diplomatic and military aid to
Israel without the least consideration for Arab feelings, and exerts great
efforts to obstruct attempts toward Arab independence or unity. For the sake of
Israel, partially at least, the U.S. has so far attacked Libya, the Sudan, Iran,
Afghanistan, the Syrian troops in Lebanon, and Iraq, and have been imposing
embargoes in one way or another on these countries. Besides, the U.S. has been
trying relentlessly to prevent Arabs and Muslims from acquiring weapons of
mass-destruction while at the same time it doesn�t even criticize Israel�s
nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, the Arabs have a very long history in
seeking the heart of the U.S. So many Arab leaders have been trying for several
decades to explain to the U.S. the importance of mutual interests based on
friendship, and some of them have been behaving as puppets. So many Arab
intellectuals, writers and lecturers have been trying to convey a message of
friendship and cooperation, but the American leadership has been irresponsive
and insulting. At the best of times, when there is a kind of cooperation or a
rising trust among Arabs with regard to American policy in the area, the U.S.
president announces more military or economic aid to Israel, disregarding
completely the fact that the Arabs have feelings, that they are humans. And the
American president would bluntly justify that peace in the Middle East would be
only brought about through a strong Israel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">American policy towards Arabs and Muslims goes
extravagantly beyond reason to the extent that one would think that this great
country is actually run by amateurs who have very little knowledge of
psychology, or whose hearts have been driven away from the truth. There is a
great Arab nation that accounts for hundreds of millions of people, that extends
over an area stretching from the Atlantic to the Gulf and rests over great
wealth looking toward a friendship with the U.S., but receives only defiance,
humiliation and an endless chain of bombs falling from American-made warplanes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As events unfolded, it became clear that the U.S. is not
actually interested in friendship with the Arabs based upon mutual respect but
rather in subjugating them. Somebody might listen to Arab leaders praising the
relationship with the U.S. as built on equal footing, but these are dictators
who are very much hated by their own peoples and are not an illuminating source
for understanding Arab feelings toward the U.S. Over the years, the U.S. has
persistently and intentionally pushed the Arabs into a corner and mounting its
pressure against them to the point that the law of physics concerning pressure
and explosion became applicable to the behaviour of Arabs toward the U.S. Some
Americans might argue against this, but here I am just conveying how the Arab
majority perceives and understands the situation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is unfortunate that the U.S. has been manipulated by
Zionist and Jewish pressure groups to an extent that it lost direction and
discretion in building healthy relations with the Arabs. The Zionist and some
Jewish machinery has been pumping so much faulty information about the Arabs and
Muslims in an effort to mislead the Americans and create a negative public
attitude against them. This machinery has so much media and financial power, and
has dug so deep into the American system of elections and the influence
connected with it. These lobbies, together with Israel, have been working hard
on American Congressmen and the White House personnel so as to insure the
continuous flow of aid for Israel at the expense of the Arabs, and have been
utilizing the concept of anti-Semitism to the utmost in an effort to terrorize
Americans from expressing themselves or questioning American policy in the
Middle East.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Israel and the lobbies connected with it have not only been
monopolizing American policy in the Middle East but also have been working hard
on distorting the image of the Arabs and the Muslims. As a direct result of
their propaganda, misconceptions about the Palestinians, the Arabs and the
Muslims have developed and intensified. And as a result of Arab unwillingness to
counteract, the American public is still unaware of the profit America gains
from trading with the Arabs and of the annual $3.2 billion in economic and
military aid given to Israel from the American government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The result must be clear: hatred of the U.S. in Arabia and
the Muslim world has been soaring. There are hundreds of millions of frustrated
and furious Arabs and Muslims who could be easily mobilized. In the end, it is
the Americans, the Arabs and the Muslims who pay the price. What about Israel
and the Zionist and Jewish lobbies in the U.S.? They are now sitting there
pouring more fuel on the already blazing fire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Muslims and the Arabs would love to have a friendly
U.S., but first the American politicians and the American public should free
themselves from misconceptions and Zionist manipulations. Part of realizing this
responsibility should fall on Arabs and Muslims, but it should be stated clearly
that Arab and Muslim public opinion remains very sensitive to an American
foreign policy that favours Israel. Instead of waging an attack or imposing an
embargo on Arab and Muslim countries every now and then, the Americans need to
learn that the stronger victimizes himself if he always thinks that power need
not be coupled with wisdom.&nbsp;<o:p>

</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This is indeed a sad, painful and trying time for the
American people. To you my fellow Americans, I offer my condolences and I share
with you your sorrow.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But, this is not a time of hasty revenge, to give sway to
blind hate, or to believe everything that our government dishes out to us via
the media. Few of us have seriously questioned the ineptitude of our Secretary
of State, Colin Powell, or how our president who barely won the elections was
not able to protect our great country from attack. Where was our good president
when we needed him the most, out playing golf again? Where was Powell, asleep?
How can civilian planes from within the US attack the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In order to cover up the inefficiency and shame of our
government, and our defense forces, our noble president with an IQ of a
chimpanzee, is ready to bomb to smithereens civilian people in other geographic
places far away from American shores, who are guilty of nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The massive offense that Bush plans will not only cost an
enormous sum of money, but the lives of our fellow countrymen at an alleged
enemy who has already stated that he did not take part in the attacks against
American installations or the people themselves. If Ben Laden were really a
terrorist, he would have been proud of this dark dank evil deed and boasted
about his success. For a man who has given up all worldly possessions in order
to help Afghanis fight for their freedom, it is hardly likely that he would
derive pleasure in the massacre of over 5000 men, women and children. He is a
devout Muslim and Islam does not wage war against innocent or unarmed civilians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Please beware that this is not all a staged performance
by our government to protect the people who really are guilty of this heinous
crime against America. In Newark, NJ, witnesses reported seeing five men
celebrating the attack on the WTC and the Pentagon. These men are Israeli
citizens so of course, they were not charged with anything and were set free.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Too, some, if not all of the names of the hijackers have
been faked. Some of the names that were used belonged to persons who have been
dead for a number of years. One of the names of the hijackers belongs to a Saudi
man who is a pilot but who was in Saudi Arabia at the time of the hijacking. He
was not one of the dead in one of the hijacked planes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I urge you to think about this fact. It is the Israelis
who stand most to benefit from this assault against Americans. They, thanks to
the blind support of the US by the way of money, weapons and the latest
technology, have the means to carry out this sabotage on NYC and the Pentagon.
The Israelis have an elaborate spy system and they know just where every
strategic site is in America. They knew exactly where Bush was that fatal day of
September 11.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While Americans are out to kill anyone and everyone, it
really doesn�t matter who, Israelis, never known for their kindness to the
Palestinians, are escalating their attacks against the indigenous inhabitants.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I urge you to search your hearts and souls for the
answers to this tragedy that has so severely shaken us all. We must realize too
that it was American planes that bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, taking the lives
of hundreds of thousands of people. Did we expect that the Japanese had no souls
and no tears that would fall to mourn their dead and wounded?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">We
messed up Vietnam so bad and we were responsible for the deaths of tens of
thousands and then when our own soldiers came home in countless body bags, we
disgracefully pulled out.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We were there in Iraq in defense of Kuwait, or so we
claimed. But, let�s face it; we no more cared about Kuwait than we did Iraq.
We cared about keeping the supply of oil flowing into the bank accounts of
nefarious people like George Bush Sr. It really didn�t matter if over a
million Iraqis lost their lives from the heaviest bombing in recent history. But
I forgot, after all, Iraqis aren�t human like we Americans are and they
don�t cry real tears like Americans do. Actually, we aren�t really concerned
whether they feel pain or not.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">We suddenly cherish our own freedom but persist in
denying it to people all over the world. Freedom is not just an American
commodity.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As we try to recover from this terrible disaster, we must
move cautiously, wisely, in a direction that will discover the true culprits. We
must steer ourselves away from deceptions and from blanket hate. If we are
unjust and attack people who are guiltless, we will destroy ourselves in the
process and it will be as sure as if we are pointing a gun to our heads and
pulling the trigger.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Our forefathers died to make our nation free from the
oppression of British tyranny and independent from foreign rule. Our
constitution was written on the basis that all men are created equal and are
entitled to the same inalienable rights and also to the dignity and respect of
others. It was written by the blood of those early Americans who so courageously
gave their lives so we may be free.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Liberty is the inherent right of every person. Let us
promote the freedom of those who struggle for it. Let us act with wisdom,
fortitude and a noble spirit so our freedoms that we cherish so dearly will be
preserved.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Let us not think and act like a mob without reason and
let us not revert back to our old sport of hunting witches when and where they
do not exist. If we do not tread softly and with an enormous amount of sagacity,
we will not lead the world to safety and peace, but instead to an apocalypse
which will mean the final hours of us all.</p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="center"><b><i>Jared Taylor*</i></b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">On
11 September, President George W. Bush explained to us on national television
that &quot;America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon
for freedom and opportunity in the world.&quot; Two days later, he spoke of
terrorists who &quot;hate our values&quot; and &quot;hate what America stands
for.&quot; The next day, at the National Cathedral, he said, &quot;They have
attacked America because we are freedom's home and defender.&quot; If that were
indeed what motivated the men who flew airplanes into the Pentagon and the World
Trade Center, there would be reason for the huge military operation President
Bush now tells us we need in order to &quot;whip terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">But
what the President said about the attacks is not just nonsense; it is dangerous
nonsense. If our country believes him, and we go to war against Islamic
fundamentalism, we will succeed only in adding millions more to the millions who
already hate us, and some of them will launch yet more attacks on us, perhaps
even worse than the ones we have just suffered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Does
President Bush really imagine Osama bin Laden saying to his men: &quot;Those
Americans are just too damn free; they've got too much opportunity. Let's kill
as many as we can&quot;? The idea is absurd. Islamic militants have a grudge
against us because of our attacks on Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq and the Sudan. But
the main reason they hate us and want to kill us is that we support Israel. Can
anyone deny that if we were not Israel's enthusiastic backer those thousands of
Americans would still be alive? It is no coincidence that the two nations
against which suicide attacks are now launched are the two nations out of 160
that walked out together from the Durban racism conference in defense of Israel.
To Muslim fundamentalists, America and Israel are one and the same, and we have
given them ample reason to think so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Fundamentalists
dislike us for what we are, but they hate us and kill us for what we do. They
despise our loose sexual standards, and many of them have not forgotten the
Crusades, but that does not make them mad enough to kill us. They kill us
because we support and finance a country they see as having been illegitimately
carved out of the very flesh of their Islamic kinsmen. With so much at stake, it
is vital that we not be confused about what motivates the terror we plan to
combat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">If
there really were something about the essential nature of the United States that
made people try to kill us, the President's plans would be justified. Congress
would be right to appropriate an emergency $20 billion for a war against Islamic
terrorism. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz would be right to promise, as
he did on 13 September, a &quot;sustained and broad&quot; campaign on the scale
of the Gulf War. The Senate would be right to authorize the president, as it did
on 14 September, to use &quot;necessary and appropriate force&quot; to
retaliate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">But
that analysis is wrong, and acting on it will bring calamity. The real question
is: Why have we so obviously chosen sides in a bitter, decades-long fight in the
Middle East? Is Israel so clearly in the right that we should risk the hatred of
half the world in order to support it? With the risks so great, we should
understand what we are doing with perfect clarity. If we go to war, it will not
be because we are the land of freedom and opportunity, but because we are the
best friend and benefactor of Israel. Should we go to war for Israel? Should we
spend $20 billion to kill Muslims, and thereby expose our cities to inevitable
reprisal for the sake of Israel? There had better be convincing answers to those
questions, but no one is even asking them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Americans
are prepared to kill and die for America; they will think twice about killing
and dying for Israel. Surely, it is because he dares not say thousands of
Americans have just died because of Israel that President Bush invents
preposterous motives for the men who killed them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">But
even if Americans were prepared to fight for Israel, a war to &quot;whip
terrorism&quot; will only whip up terrorism. Israel has responded with great
force to terror attacks, and the fury this provokes among Palestinians leads
only to more terror. What we are planning will have the same effect, except that
the terror will be directed at us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Of
course, there is a way Israel could end all Palestinian terror attacks. It need
only act on the principle President Bush announced on 11 September: to make
&quot;no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those
who harbor them.&quot; By that terrible logic, Israel should exterminate every
Palestinian�it has the means to do that. By that logic we should exterminate
every Iraqi, Afghani, Yemeni and Iranian�we have the means to do that, too. Of
course, we would then have to exterminate all Muslims, since by then all would
be potential terrorists.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">If
we fight Israel's enemies, the United States will become like Israel: a garrison
State and battleground. Our leaders are already warning us that our safety will
henceforth require more inspections, restrictions and intrusions. There will be
worse. The latest series of revenge killings in the Middle East has finally
driven some of Israel's own Arab citizens to violence. Is it out of the question
to suspect that if we launch our own jihad against terrorism, we may eventually
drive some of our 7 million Muslim citizens to violence against us?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">By
all means, let us find and even kill the people who helped carry out these
terrible acts of terror against us. But it is madness to invent false motives
for them, to pretend we have done nothing to provoke them, and to launch a war
for Israel that will only give even millions more reasons to hate us. If that is
our response to terror, we will only ensure for ourselves yet more terror, yet
more smouldering ruins and shattered lives.</p>

36.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:auto;text-autospace:ideograph-numeric ideograph-other">&nbsp;From
the very beginning, even before there was any evidence at all, American
officials blamed Osama Bin Laden for the strikes against the World Trade
Center�s twin towers and the Pentagon.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The accusations against the millionaire Saudi dissident
fanned the fires of hatred against Arabs and Muslims who live in America. In one
day, Zionism accomplished what it could not do in more than 50 years of
anti-Arab and anti-Muslim propaganda via the cinema and through the media.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">What happened to the innocents who happened to be on the
hijacked planes or present in the buildings that were hit is a horrible tragedy.
Now, angered beyond belief, Americans are thirsty for blood�anyone�s blood.
They need a scapegoat and the media has given them all too conveniently the idea
that this scapegoat is to be found in Arabs and Muslims all over the world.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It would not be in good taste to say that these attacks
are the result of the American foreign policy in the Middle East that is
consistently pro-Israel and anti-Arab. No one cares right now that it is
American missiles, bombs, aircraft and bullets that cut down and murder
Palestinians just because they are Palestinian. No one is concerned about how
many Palestinians have been slaughtered by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
and right now through his crocodile tears, he is trying to portray himself as
the �good guy.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But think about it. Who would really stand to gain the
most from such an attack against the American people? No one Arab country would
be stupid enough to carry out an attack against the military might of America
and its allies. Any Arab leader, however impotent he might be, would not be fool
enough to bring about the wrath of the world�s greatest power.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And this is not a case of some disgruntled isolated
patches of people trying to get revenge for various wrongs. What happened took a
lot of money and know-how to carry it through. The country best enabled to carry
out such a humongous feat is not an Arab or a Muslim one, but Israel.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Israel is the one country that stands the most to gain
from such an unfathomable attack on American institutions and military. Israel
is the one country that has, thanks to US assistance; the most sophisticated
spying devices in the world with the exception of the US itself. Remember
Jonathan Pollard?</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Zionists have penetrated every echelon of America. They
are there in the FBI, the CIA, in conglomerates, in Congress, in the White House
and in every neighborhood and at every workstation throughout America.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Israel would stand most to gain. Even though Sharon has
declared a day of mourning for America�s dead, he sheds false tears and it is
very very likely that in his heart he could not be happier. In the meantime, he
has stepped up his crimes against Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">It is not just what American officials are telling their
people, it is what they are not telling them as well that is very important.
Evidence can even be planted to make it look like Arab and Muslim terrorists
carried out the evil deed of killing thousands of innocent Americans.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By accusing Islamic groups of the attacks on American
people, the media has jeopardized the safety and lives of Arab Americans and
Muslim Americans who reside in the United States. The hate directed against
these ethnic Americans is blind and evil.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">What is equally surprising is the response today by one
of Reverend Billy Graham�s sons who said that America must retaliate with mass
weapons of destruction against the perpetrators of the attack and anyone who
harbors them. Even if Osama Bin Laden is responsible for what happened in New
York and the Pentagon, he is not a country and innocent people should not be
slaughtered for something they have not done. But for a person who should be
preaching about peace and harmony, for forgiveness, for seeking the roots of the
tragedy and trying to eradicate evil in a sane way, Reverend Graham�s son is
advocating death, destruction, murder and perhaps an Armageddon.</p>

rise up</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="center"><b>�there are no impregnable
fortresses�<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><i>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;This was the message from President Thabo Mbeki to
the NGO Forum of the World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. It
was a general caution about the �wretched of the earth,� who in many
instances are poor and dispossessed. Being the consummate politician that he is,
Mbeki also had some specific words on Palestine:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">�I would like to believe that we want to make the
assertion boldly that no human being anywhere in the world can be truly
fulfilled if other human beings on our common planet continue to be dehumanized
by racial and gender oppression and discrimination and poverty and even by
Statelessness, as has happened to the Palestinian people.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mbeki�s address was delivered on 28 August 2001,
exactly one month before the first anniversary of the Aqsa Intifada (uprising).
All that he witnessed throughout the previous twelve months must have, to some
degree, reinforced his convictions. Although the South African President did not
mention the persecutor by name, as he should, everyone knew he was referring to
Zionist Israel. Armed with the best and latest military hardware from
America�s arsenal, the Jewish State has waged a relentless campaign of terror
against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. When representatives
from the South African NGOs visited Palestine shortly before the Durban
Conference, they were confronted by realities of a system that were far worse
than what existed during the heyday of apartheid rule in their country. It was
against this background that 3,000 NGOs from 166 countries decided to brand
Israel as a �racist apartheid State.�</p>
<h1 align="left" style="text-align:left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#000066"><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font color="#000000">A racist solution
</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></u><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The road to Durban was a long and torturous one. Those
who undertook the journey to join the global fight against racism encountered
numerous obstacles along the way. Through their perseverance and exercise of
political will they accomplished their mission. With all its history of racial
discrimination and then reconciliation, South Africa provided the perfect
setting for an open and frank dialogue. The occasion, however, demanded
recognition of past and present injustices from the Atlantic slave trade to the
Zionist occupation of Palestine. In the case of Palestine, the ongoing Aqsa
Intifada ensured that it was certainly remembered. Then came the questions.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">How much longer can the Palestinian people continue in
their resistance to foreign military occupation? Will the international
community ever dump the manufactured stereotypes and accept that the
Palestinians are a people who have the right to live in peace with honour and
dignity in their own land? When will the leaders of the �free and democratic
world� act according to established laws and not by the jaundiced
interpretations of a bigoted minority who stalk the corridors of global power?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Given all that has happened in the last twelve months, it is only the
morally bankrupt or those driven by fanaticism and prejudice that would stand up
today and deny that the Palestinians are not wronged.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the present circumstances, historians have
understandably identified similarities between the Nazi 900-day siege of
Leningrad during the Second World War and the current Zionist blockade of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. With water supplies being effectually rationed by the
military occupation and agricultural land destroyed by marauding settlers, the
threat of widespread famine and epidemics loom larger than ever. But even in the
face of this deprivation, the Palestinians are prepared to continue. Everything
confirms this. The more Israel commits atrocities, the more the conflict
intensifies. The more arrogant and outrageous it becomes in its demands, the
more unrelenting the resistance becomes. These truths are not peculiar to
Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims, but it is the natural way of all peoples who are
denied the freedom to determine their destiny.</p>
<h2 align="left" style="text-align:left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399"><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font color="#000000">Unlimited demands</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></u><!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The story of what has unfolded in the occupied
Palestinian territories over the last year is a classic case of a people seeking
their own fulfilment through the degradation of another. It is also one of human
greed in its most primitive form. Here are a people who refused to assimilate
into the European societies from which they originate. Motivated by delusions of
power and grandeur, they resurrect a claim to another land based on an
historical episode that occurred 3,000 years earlier. Unlike Mussolini, the
Italian Fascist who resurrected a similar claim to recreate the Holy Roman
Empire, they gained the support of the �great powers� for a national home in
Palestine. Since then, the national home was transformed into an expansionist
State without a constitution or geographic borders, which claims the right to
determine the nature and timing of Palestinian independence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Can Israelis realize their human potential and fulfilment
while the Palestinians are degraded on their own land? The events since
September 2000 belie this. Inasmuch as the Palestinians have paid a high price
for their freedom and would have to make many more sacrifices, Zionist Israel
will not have an easy ride. A cursory view of the material costs confirms
massive losses for the Jewish State. Since the outbreak of the Aqsa Intifada 83
factories were partially closed and 14 fully closed in Israel. The Occupation
Army, which, according to its sources, requires three-quarters of a million U.S.
dollars a day to stay in the territories, is now experiencing extreme
difficulties in conscripting personnel despite their superior firepower both in
numbers and kind.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although many in officialdom would like to pretend
otherwise, the rules of the conflict have also undergone a dramatic change over
the last year. For one thing, Israel has long abandoned its facade of �land
for peace� and has chosen instead to chant the mantra of �peace for
peace.� Needless to say, this means peace on its terms. It entails a peace in
which the Jewish State maintains its settler-colonies in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, completes its annexation of Jerusalem, and denies the right of five
million Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. This security proposition
is not only untenable but is, moreover, wholly unacceptable because it seeks the
complete subjugation of one people by another.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<h2 align="left" style="text-align:left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399"><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font color="#000000">Attainable
objectives</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></u><!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Israel�s illegal occupation of Palestinian land, wanton
slaughter of its people and destruction of their infrastructure are all intended
to frustrate the Palestinian march to independence. The extra-judicial killing
of Abu Ali Mustafa at the beginning of the Durban Conference did not in any way
help the Israeli cause. To the contrary, it illustrated to the international
gathering the parallels between apartheid South Africa and Zionist Israel.
Moreover, it did nothing to alter the basic fact that the conflict is not one
between two sovereign countries but rather one between a foreign Occupying
Power, Israel, and an indigenous Occupied People, the Palestinians, who are
determined to be free and independent on their land. The sad news for the former
is that no alien domination has ever survived in a land where its people have
been motivated by the will to be free.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Durban marked a watershed in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict not because the United States and Israel walked out of the
inter-governmental talks but because the issue was restored to the top of the
international agenda. Try as they did to stifle, ignore and minimize the dangers
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it remained the talk of the city. While
expressing solidarity to the Palestinian people, the international assembly
underscored that theirs was not simply intended to end the immediate repression
but it was, in the longer term, geared to assist in their quest for freedom and
justice.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In retrospect, Zionist Israel must have learnt a few
things from the South African colonial experience. Hence they continue to deny
that Zionism is a form of racism. They must have recalled that when the
Afrikaans acknowledged that apartheid was a crime against humanity, they had to
take remedial measures to expunge its curse. The first of these was the system
of one man, one vote, which inevitably brought black majority rule to the
country. This was, of course, not the end of the road. As they celebrated
victory, the African National Congress made it clear that the struggle had to
continue. Black political empowerment would not be complete without progress on
the economic front. After all, the indigenous population was poor not because
they were lazy but because they were impoverished by the system. The whites who
expropriated their land used it to access loans from financial institutions,
expand their businesses, and eventual dominance of the economy. The relationship
between land dispossession and poverty is not, however, peculiar to South
Africa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been a primary cause
of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and will, likewise, be central to its
resolution.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">That the Durban conference had devoted so much attention
to Zionism was largely expected. The previous UN conferences held in Geneva in
1978 and 1983 both focused on the issues of decolonization and apartheid. It was
only natural, therefore, that this conference should focus on the last remaining
bastions of foreign domination and institutionalized racism. As the unwilling
victims of a military occupation, the justice of the Palestinian cause was
self-evident. Thus they found natural allies among the once-disenfranchised
South African people, as well as the thousands more who had journeyed to Durban.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For the first time in many years, the Palestinians had seized the moral
high ground in the international arena.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
other image demonstrated this more than the poster that depicted the 12-year-old
martyr of the Soweto revolt, Hector Peterson, and that of Muhammad al-Durra, the
12-year-old Palestinian martyr of the Aqsa Intifada. The poster read,
�Apartheid lives on in the land of Zionism.�</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One year after the murder of Muhammad al-Durra, the Aqsa
Intifada shows no sign of abating. Driven by a kind of self-perpetuating logic,
it remains focused on the national objectives of an independent State with
Jerusalem as its capital and the return of its exiled population. Since such
priceless objectives are seldom granted but frequently won, the Palestinian
people, as they have shown, will have to pay a price no less than the Algerians,
Kenyans or even the Americans. The question today, therefore, is not whether
they will achieve their objectives but rather when. For as long as there is
resistance, there remains a hope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
the veteran of the South African resistance wisely observed, when the oppressed
rise up, �there are no impregnable fortresses.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Samah Jabr*</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Once upon a time, there was a little colony of beings
living peacefully among themselves at the top of a rocky hill. Life at the
summit was good, food and comfortable housing aplenty and few enemies. The
population of this society was happy. They profited from being alone and all
alike, each exactly like the other. Being sea anemones, this group had only
nerve nets that allowed them to stretch and fetch, all the while clinging
together. In their brainless state, all the sea anemones were &quot;neophobians,&quot;
meaning they all feared change. This condition existed among the cloned citizens
as it had for all time, being passed from one generation to the next via their
DNA messenger cells. It was, evidently, a genetically-created means of
protection.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anemone neophobians were a bit like radically conservative
folks today. They lived amidst their own past, present and future as if the
progression of time had no power to influence them at all. But events were to
prove them wrong. Not far away, another anemone society sprung up in the rocky
cliff's largest crevice. These beings were the progeny of the first group,
children who had drifted away from home. They were still afraid of anything new
and had clung together just as tightly as their parents had in the home they had
left behind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But after many years, the children of these anemone's
children vaguely began to be less afraid of change. And with that, some of those
children left to seek more fertile territory. Oddly, unlike their forefathers,
they grew eager to expand and to fill up the entire mountainside with their own
selves, whom they now believed were superior. This group was warlike. They began
to attack neighbouring colonies. As they did, they realized that some nations
struck back immediately and with enough ferocity to keep them at bay. When this
happened, the warriors moved on and peace resumed among those attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Other groups were more circumspect, pulling into themselves and sending
out fighters only as needed. But against those who opposed them but did not
manage to defeat them, the warriors kept pressing and pressing until they had
totally destroyed all life in the area they desired. Then, they moved in and
expanded their territory without restraint or opposition, until, that is,
another warring group appeared.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On and on the wars went between those begotten by the many
divisions. One group became more and more aggressive, another preemptive and a
third ready and eager to fight back. A fourth integrated into the world of their
conquerors, while another group became so powerful that its members attacked
only when they were sure they could win. Truces occurred from time to time, but
there was absolutely no possibility of peace among the colonies, all of whom (we
must remember) had originally been born of the members of the first colony, once
staunchly established peacefully at the top of the hill, but now completely
gone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The wars still continue among the brainless sea anemone
societies. Sea anemones, bags of flesh and tentacles, act only through their
nerves, a system that allows no possibility at all of intellect or thought. They
reproduce by dividing themselves, which is not much fun, but does the job and
fills the sea with identical members. And many anemones in the sea are able to
sting another anemone to death.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sea anemones, like human beings, send messages from one
generation to another in a spiral notebook called DNA. The DNA, however, does
not suggest carrying out complex systems of war on other colonies. It gives us
the tools and instincts of defense, but we are not slaves to these. We also have
reason to override the red lights and sirens that blare when we are threatened.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sea anemones do not go to church, the synagogue or the
mosque to find out how they should behave. They have no ideology or constitution
to follow. They have no memory of history. They can only eat and replicate and
sting each other to death. It's not surprising, then, that instinct among sea
anemones leads to warlike behaviour rather than acceptance and willingness to
live together in peace. I am, however, surprised at our behaviour.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After experiencing a full year of war and violence between
us Palestinians and colonizing Israelis (a war that is backed financially and
emotionally by the world's remaining superpower) and now at this very time
watching America shiver in vain after the criminal attacks that targeted its
economic and defense systems, and also now waiting apprehensively with everyone
else for what is yet to come, I am thinking about those sea anemones.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have to wonder if humanity has reverted to the
brainlessness of the sea anemone and forgotten what we know of being human:
happiness, productivity and our responsibility as stewards of a world that is
changing as we watch. Sea anemones are only a mass of flesh and tentacles,
neither of which has the capacity�as far as we know�to suggest to another of
its kind that the population might find community and right-living without
harming others. We wage our wars with full knowledge of what we are doing and
why. We do have intellect, ideology, education, experience and religion to guide
us. Still, in spite of all the moral and intellectual training presented to us
century after century, we, like the anemones, choose war over peaceful
coexistence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I feel that disconnect acutely, as a Palestinian under
occupation. Israel takes what is not hers to take; citing her own fear of
prejudice for the reason the world must stand against us Palestinians. Israelis
destroy our lives and then point the finger at those whom they destroyed.
Israelis do not appear to consider our reasons for fear at all, let alone that
we are fellow human beings, enmeshed with them through heritage and moral
exactitude. And so we Palestinians resist, determined to hold onto earth we call
our own, earth left behind by those who died in the struggle to protect our
community, sacrificing themselves for the good of the group.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And now the United States government declares a war against
an undefined enemy called &quot;terrorism.&quot; In a Godly manner, the leaders
of the U.S. &quot;will lead the world to victory.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;You are either with us or with the terrorists&quot;,
they tell the rest of the world in elevated and imposed morality. And then they
drop to the greatest depths in the language to say, &quot;We want Osama dead or
alive.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From over here in Palestine, I think I can see a bit more
clearly. After all, what is the difference between admitting that one wants to
destroy the terrorists, even at the cost of innocent people, and the logic of
those who wanted to punish the American government by killing thousands of
innocent Americans? It's as if we can only perpetuate violence if we remain as
brainless as the anemone. Where has our sense of human responsibility taken
flight? Never before in the history of mankind have we known as much as we do
today. Once we were no more than hordes ranging about on horseback, uncivilized
pillagers, acting without benefit of university and house of worship, let alone
the mass media. Then, people followed their leaders thoughtlessly like lemmings
to the sea. Perhaps, now, you can see why I am thinking of sea anemones. Even as
recently as the Second World War, news took days, if not years, to reach the
other side of the world and people didn't know truth from fiction. Now, we see
war, genocide and oppression as it happens. Even so, friends of Israel insist
that it is we Palestinians who challenge them, denying what people can see for
their own eyes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is no longer any possibility of saying, &quot;We
didn't know.&quot; We know. And it is inexcusable. I've been taught that a wrong
does not make another wrong right. I think there are lots of people�Jewish,
Christian and Muslim�who believe that, too. Unlike the thoughtless anemone, we
know better. And that is the most disturbing factor of how I experience life a
year into this current flare-up of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We know too
much in this new millennium to be absolved of the crimes we allow to happen.
That is true for us, the Palestinians who react to instigation, and for the
Zionists who deny over and over again the racist undertones of their desires.
And it is also true for the Americans, as they set out to decimate something (it
is yet unclear what, nor how doing so will turn the world aright).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Watching the streams of thousands of Afghan refugees on
television, I think I have a better idea. The Americans should bomb them with
bread. And what a sweet victory it would be over those who charge the United
States with being self-interested and bloated with revenge!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I cannot help but think of the deceptive vintage cigarette
ad, promoting the poor health and browning teeth of smoking. It shows a
beautiful woman inhaling deeply and smiling above the caption, &quot;You've come
a long way, Baby!&quot; From where I sit, humankind hasn't come very far at all.
We seem just as brainless and amoral as sea anemones, killing ourselves through
the haze of smokers' denials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the anniversary of the Second Intifada, I'd like to run
a notice that shows an Israeli with an Uzi, a Palestinian with a stone and an
American waving a dollar and run the caption over it: &quot;You've come nowhere
at all, man!&quot; Do you think anyone would get the point?</p>

Religious Background of Rabin's Assassination</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="p2" style="line-height:150%">Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered
for religious reasons. The murderer and his sympathizers were and still are
convinced that the killing was dictated by God and was therefore a commandment
of Judaism. Comprehensive surveys, published in the Hebrew press, of people in
religious neighborhoods and especially religious settlements indicated great
sympathy for the murder. The polarization of approval and disapproval in the
Israeli Jewish community over the killing of the prime minister of the Jewish
state has increased since the time of the murder. Many Israeli Jews, significant
numbers of Jews living outside Israel and most non-Jews do not possess
sufficient knowledge of Jewish history and religion to put this kind of an
assassination into its proper context. In this chapter we shall attempt to
provide the historical-religious background necessary for an understanding of
the Rabin assassination.</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%">Jewish
history has been replete with religious civil wars or rebellions accompanied by
civil wars in which horrifying assassi�nations were committed. The Great
Rebellion (AD 66-73) of Jews against the Romans that culminated in the
destruction of the Second Temple and in mass suicide in Masada is exemplary. The
defenders of Masada were, as many present-day visitors to the Masada site are
seemingly unaware, a band of assassins called Sikarikin, a name taken from the
word for a short sword that group members hid under their robes and used to kill
their Jewish opponents in crowds of people. In the Talmud the word means
terrorists or robbers and is applied only to Jews. Neither Masada nor this
particular group are mentioned in the Talmud or in any part of the traditional
writing preserved by Jews. Actually the Sikarikin were an ancient Jewish
analogue to modem-day terrorists. Their suicide activity resembled the terrorist
behavior of the suicide bombers who are so abhorred in the state of Israel. The
Sikarikin escaped to Masada not from the Romans but from their Jewish brethren.
Shortly after the rebellion against the Romans began, the Roman army that was
advancing to Jerusalem was initially defeated and had to withdraw. The Sikarikin
attempted forcefully to establish their leader, Menahem, as absolute king. The
Jews of Jerusalem then attacked and defeated the Sikarikin in the temple itself,
killing most of them including Menahem. The remaining Sikarikin escaped to
Masada where they stayed during the rebellion; they did not fight the Romans but
instead robbed neighboring Jewish villages. Three years after the Sikarikin
defeat, the Roman army, commanded by Titus, approached Jerusalem for the final
onslaught. (Titus' chief of staff, Tiberius Julius Alexander, was a Jew, the
nephew of the great philosopher, Philo.) Jerusalem was divided into three parts;
each part was under the command of a different leader; the leaders had already
been fighting with one another for two years. The Roman Empire at that time was
then concerned about a civil war. One of the leaders, Eliezer the Priest,
commanded the Temple and used it as his stronghold. On Passover eve in the year
AD 70, another rebel leader, Yohanan of Gush Halav, utilized brilliant strategy
to overcome Eliezer. He dressed his soldiers as pious pilgrims who seemed to be
coming to the temple for the Passover sacrifice. After being admitted to the
temple by the gullible Eliezer without a body search, they, after guessing
correctly that Eliezer and his men would not carry arms in a place so holy,
pulled out their swords and slaughtered all their opponents. The well-known
Masada terrorists became Jewish and Israeli national heroes, as did the
Jerusalem Jews who killed most of the Sikarikin. Yohanan of Gush Halav also
became a national hero, but Bliezer the Priest, perhaps because he was killed by
Jews, was completely forgotten. In these and in many similar incidents in Jewish
history, killing was allegedly committed for the greater glory of God. Yigal
Amir, Rabin's assassin, made such an allegation.</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%;
tab-stops:11.0pt">The violence between Jews did not end with the loss of Jewish
independence and the ceasing of Jewish rebellions. (The last Jewish rebellion
occurred in AD 614.) From the Middle Ages until the advent of the modern state,
Jewish communities enjoyed a great degree of autonomy. The rabbis who headed and
had the authority in these communities were most often able to persecute Jews
mercilessly. The rabbis persecuted Jews who committed religious sins and even
more harshly persecuted Jews who informed upon other Jews to non-Jews or in
other ways harmed Jewish interests. The rabbis generally tolerated violence
committed by some Jews against other Jews, especially against women, so long as
the Jewish religion and their own interests were not harmed. The relevancy of
this aspect of Jewish history to the Rabin murder is obvious. The assassin,
Yigal Amir, is a talmudic scholar who was trained in a yeshiva that inculcated
its students to believe that this violence committed by rabbis over a lengthy
time period was in accordance with God's word.</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">Long
before Rabin's assassination, scholarly studies of Jewish history, written in
Hebrew, recorded the violence mentioned above. The assassination aroused so much
public interest in this topic that the Hebrew press published numerous articles
either written by or resulting from interviews with distinguished Israeli
scholars. Rami Rosen's November 15, 1996 <i>Haaretz Magazine </i>article, titled
&quot;History of a Denial,&quot; is an excellent and representative example.
Although Rosen interviewed several distinguished historians, he relied primarily
upon the views of Professor Yisrael Bartal, the head of the department of Jewish
history at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem Bartal began his statement:<o:p>

<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">Zionism
has described the diaspora Jews as weak people who desire peace and abhor every
form of violence. It is astonishing to discover that orthodox Jews are also
providing similar descriptions. They describe past Jewish society as one not
interested in anything other than the Halacha and the fulfillment of the
commandments. The entire Jewish literature produced in eastern Europe, however,
teaches us that the reverse is true. Even in the nineteenth century the
descriptions of how Jews lived are filled with violent battles that often took
place in the synagogues, of Jews beating other Jews in the streets or spitting
on them, of the frequent cases of pulling out of beards and of numbers of
murders.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="p4" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">Citing
the authorities interviewed, Rosen explained that many murders were committed
for religious reasons. It was usual in some Hassidic circles until the last
quarter of the nineteenth century to attack and often to murder Jews who had
reform religious tendencies, even if small ones. These Hassidic Jews also
attacked one another because of frequent quarrels between different holy rabbis
over spheres of influence, money and prestige. After having learned the opinions
of the best Israeli scholars, Rosen asked:<o:p>

Avrushmi [who threw a hand grenade into a Peace Now demonstration, killing one
and wounding a few people] and Ami Poper [who killed seven innocent Palestinian
workers and was adopted as a great hero by extremists] parts of the Jewish
tradition? Is it only by chance that Baruch Goldstein massacred his victims on
the Purim holiday?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="p4" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">Rosen

historiography of the last 1500 years shows that the picture is different from
the one previously shown to us. It includes massacres of Christians [by Jews];
mock repetitions of the crucifixion of Jesus tat usually took place on Purim;
cruel murders within the family; liquidation of informers, often done for
religious reasons by secret rabbinical courts, which issued a sentence of
&quot;pursuer&quot; and appointed secret executioners; assassinations of
adulterous women in synagogues and/or the cutting of their [the women's] noses
by command of the rabbis. <o:p>

<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">Rosen included in his long article
many well-documented cases of massacres of Christians and mock repetitions of
the crucifixion of Jesus on Purim, most of which occurred either in the late
ancient period or in the Middle Ages. (Some isolated cases occurred in
sixteenth-century Poland.) From the eleventh century until the nineteenth
century, Ashkenazi Jews were more violent and fanatical than were the Oriental
Jews<sub> </sub>although the fanaticism of the Spanish Jews during both Muslim
and Christian rule was exceptional. Jewish historians have not yet determined
the causes of those differences. The influence of Christian fanaticism on the
Jews may have been a cause. The Jews who lived in Spain may have been influenced
by the fact that Muslim Spain was more fanatical than the rest of the Muslim
world.<o:p>

<p class="p4" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%;
tab-stops:11.0pt 49.0pt">The violence perpetrated against women for centuries
and other aspects of internal group violence influenced the developing character
of traditional Jewish society. This character set the contextual framework for
Rabin's assassination Citing a few case examples here may further understanding
of this character. Rabbi Simha Asaf's book, <i>The Punishments After the Talmud
Was Finalized: Materials for the History of Hebrew Law </i>(Jerusalem, 1922) is
a marvelous source of information. Rabbi Asaf, who subsequently became a
professor at the Hebrew University and in 1948 was one of the first nine judges
of the Israeli Supreme Court, was a distin�guished scholar and a religious Jew.
Convinced that a Jewish state would be estab1ished, he wrote his book in order
to show that a sufficient number of legal cases existed in the history of
punishments inflicted by Jewish religious courts to provide precedents.</p>
<p class="p4" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%;
tab-stops:11.0pt 49.0pt">Although some variances in halachic interpretation and
in practice existed, violence against women, as defined in any reasonable and
modern way, was routinely practiced for centuries in most Jewish communities.
Some rabbis allowed the Jewish husband to beat his wife when she disobeyed him.
Other rabbis limited this &quot;right&quot; by requiring that, prior to the
beating, a rabbinical court, after considering the husband's complaint, had to
issue an order. Presumably as an extension of this husband's right, rabbinical
courts in Spain ordered the cruellest punishment for Jewish women suspected of
fornication, prostitution and adultery and a much lighter punishment for Jewish
male fornicators. In the early fourteenth century a local Jewish notable asked
the famous Spanish rabbi, Rabenu<sup> </sup>Asher, whether it was correct
punishment to cut the nose of a Jewish widow, made pregnant by a Muslim. The
notable added that, although the evidence itself was not conclusive, the
pregnancy was well-known in the city. Rabenu Asher answered: &quot;You have
decided beautifully to cut her nose in order tat those committing adultery with
her will find her ugly, but let this be done suddenly so that she will not
become an apostate [before her nose is cut]&quot; (Asaf, p.69). In a case
wherein a male fornicated with Muslim women, Rabbi Yehuda, the son of Rabenu
Asher, ordered only excommunication or imprisonment (Asaf, p. 78). This same
punishment was prescribed when male Jews owned a Muslim female slave with whom
other male Jews fornicated. The rabbis regarded the commission of adultery of
Jewish women with Jewish men as less serious. In such a case one rabbi ordered
that the woman's hair be shorn and that she be officially excommunicated in the
synagogue in the presence of other women (Asaf, p. 87). The Sephardic Jews of
Jerusalem sheared women�s hair as punishment for such sexual sins still in the
nineteenth century. In some recorded cases the punishment was based upon the
belief that the sexual sins <span style="color:black">of Jews, especially those
committed by women, prevented rain from falling. The rabbis supposed that the
rain would fall if Jewish women sinners were punished. Enlightened Hebrew press
commentators at the time humorously noted that the rain did not fall even after
women had been punished. In places where more modern attitudes prevailed,
however, Spanish and Portuguese Jews desisted from these ancestral customs. Asaf
quotes the elders of the Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg in the late
seventeenth century who, although having publicly accused members of their
community of having intimate relations with non-Jewish women, expressed their
regret that they could not punish them. Asaf pointed to the reason: &quot;In
every such case they must get permission from the town judges&quot; (p.95). The
Jewish community, Asaf wrote, could only inflict religious sanctions, such as
telling two brothers that they could not enter the synagogue until they had
dismissed a notorious servant from their home (p.97).<o:p>

<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">The
Jewish rabbinical authorities in some eastern pans of Europe could inflict
somewhat tougher punishments. These punishments, however, were less severe than
those that had been imposed in Spain. The heads of the Jewish community in
Prague decided in 1612 that all Jewish prostitutes had to leave the town by a
certain date or be branded after that date with a hot iron (Asaf, p. 114). The
prostitutes' main offence was that they were seen drinking non-�kosher wine
with some unnamed notables of the community. The most tolerant communities were
those in Italy who, as Asaf recorded, gave full encouragement to the
prostitutes, because they saved &quot;bachelors and fools from the worse sins-
of adultery or of cohabitation with non-Jewish women.</span></p>
