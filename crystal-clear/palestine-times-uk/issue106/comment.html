<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#0000FF">The Pope, Palestine and Islam</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Pope John Paul II is the head of the Vatican and spiritual leader of
hundreds of millions of Catholic Christians. Hence, his direct and especially indirect
political influence cannot be underestimated, especially in an age in which religion is
increasingly becoming the ultimate ideology.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His recent visits to Egypt, Jordan and Palestine were said to be religious
and spiritual in nature. However, one does not need much imagination to observe the
political ramifications of these papal visits.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The main goal of the visits, it seemed, was to further enhance the status
and stature of Christians, particularly Catholics, in this predominantly Muslim region. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, there is nothing wrong about bettering the Christian lot if it is
done in a non-sectarian manner and in the context of an overall societal advancement,
covering such vital aspects as human rights, rule of law and civil liberties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the destiny of Christian Arabs, whether in Egypt, Jordan or in
Palestine, is inextricably entwined with that of their Muslim brethren and countrymen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Christian Arabs, although they comprise less than 4% of the Arab
population, are a minority only in the numerical sense. Otherwise, they view themselves
and are viewed by Muslim Arabs as an inseparable part of the socio-cultural fabric of the
Arab-Islamic civilization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabs, proceeding from the Islamic ideals of hospitality and religious
tolerance, welcomed the Pope as fit for the leadership of Roman Catholic Christianity,
despite the troubled historical and present relationship between the latter and Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Palestine, and despite the many overtures the Pope has made to the
Zionists (often at the expense of both Muslims and Palestinians), Palestinians were
looking forward to welcoming the Pope to their land, still bleeding from decades of
Zionist occupation and oppression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians hoped the Pope would see face to face what the brutal
ugliness of Zionism did to a peaceable people whose only &#147;crime&#148; was its refusal
to dispossess to advancing Zionists fleeing Christian persecution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And he did, at the Deheishe refugee camp, which is merely a small sample
epitomizing the enduring plight of millions of dispossessed refugees, dispersed to the
four corners of the world, and still denied their right to return to their homeland. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The refugees and all Palestinians wanted to hear from the Pope what any
just man would have said, in particular that &#147;you have an absolute and inalienable
right to return to your homeland.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nobody, of course, would want to put words in the Pope&#146;s mouth.
However, the Vatican should have realized that the cause of justice in Palestine
couldn&#146;t have been served without the Pope siding with the oppressed against their
oppressors, with the victims against their victimizers and with right against wrong.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, we, as Palestinians, would have liked the Pope to
refrain from issuing free apologies to the Zionists because such apologies were mainly
used to render legitimacy to Zionist torment of Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionism simply thrives on anti-Semitism, and if there was no
anti-Semitism, Zionism would create one. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then there is another issue that needs to be discussed in a frank and
genuine manner, and that is the horrible sins that Christendom committed against the
followers of Islam throughout the centuries. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Muslims have always been on the receiving end of Christian,
especially Catholic, persecution, aggression and genocide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Inquisition, the Crusades, the colonial wars and invasions, and
especially the sinister implanting by Christian powers of the Zionist State in the heart
of the Muslim world, in Palestine, are all Christian attempts at decimating and
liquidating Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, Muslims were greatly disappointed at the Pope&#146;s failure to
mention Muslims by name among the peoples and the groups entitled to received the
Vatican&#146;s apology. After all, they have been Europe&#146;s premier victim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even today, Muslims are still killed and persecuted by Christians in a
whole host of countries and regions from Bosnia to Indonesia.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent gruesome genocide in Bosnia, Kosovo and the ongoing war of
extermination against the Muslim people of Chechnya are only a vivid reminder that the
Church still has to make strident leaps in its moral awakening.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We hope it will never be too late for the &#147;Holy See&#148; to
apologize to Muslims as he did for the Jews.</p>
