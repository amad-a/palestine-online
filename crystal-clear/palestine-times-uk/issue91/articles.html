<h3><center>Netanyahu spoils Clinton's visit, demands more Palestinian
concessions<br>
</center></h3>

<p><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> <b><i>From Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p>In a calculated step that is ostensibly meant to woo the Israeli
far-right to his side in advance of a probable early general election
in the Jewish State, the Israeli Prime Minister sought to and
succeeded in bringing U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel
and the Palestinian autonomous enclaves to a disappointing end.</p>

<p>On Monday night, 14 December, Netanyahu told Mr. Clinton that
he was satisfied with the public show in Gaza, during which hundreds
of Palestinian leaders and dignitaries endorsed, by way of raising
their hands, a letter that Arafat had sent to Clinton two years
ago, nullifying clauses in the Palestinian Charter that are incompatible
with the peace process.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also informed Clinton that he was willing to attend
a three-way summit at the Beit Hanun juncture on the borders between
Israel proper and the Gaza Strip, where, he said, &quot;things
will be sorted out and the peace process will be brought back
on track.&quot;</p>

<p>The meeting was supposed to take place soon after the public
annulment of the Charter in Gaza. However, Netanyahu demanded
that the summit be held Tuesday morning instead, saying that there
were a few matters he was trying to sort out.<br>
The initial Israeli reactions to the Kapuzoka at Rashad al Shawa
convention centre apparently gave Clinton and Arafat a false impression
that everything was all right and that Netanyahu was willing to
reciprocate on matters such as the release of Palestinian prisoners
and the resumption of Israeli redeployment in the central and
southern parts of the West Bank, as indeed stipulated in the Wye
River memorandum.</p>

<p>Indeed, Netanyahu did publicly praise the public reaffirmation
of the Charter annulment in Gaza, describing it as &quot;a positive
and enormous step that would bury the covenant forever.&quot;</p>

<p>He added, rather gleefully, &quot;that it was significant that
Arabs everywhere witnessed the proceedings in Gaza to realize
that Israel is an immutable reality in this part of the world&quot;,
which suggested that he was willing to meet at least some Palestinian
demands.<br>
But there was none of that. On Tuesday, when the three-way meeting
was convened, Netanyahu gave every impression that he was opting
for a crisis with the Palestinians and if need be with the Americans
as well.</p>

<p>He told Arafat and Clinton that what happened in Gaza the night
before was good, but never sufficient to cause Israel to change
its position.</p>

<p>He also reiterated his declared stance on the subject of Palestinian
political prisoners, saying it was out of question that Israel
would agree to release &quot;murderers of our children.&quot;</p>

<p>Sensing that Netanyahu was after a breakdown rather than a
breakthrough, PA President Arafat turned to President Clinton,
asking him to tell Netanyahu that the Palestinians had already
fulfilled their part of the Wye River agreement.</p>

<p>Soon, an acrimonious verbal exchange between the Palestinian
and Israeli delegations ensued, with the Americans, especially
Mr. Clinton, acting as peace maintainers.</p>

<p>In such atmospherics, Arafat, who had come to the meeting smiling
and hopeful that a breakthrough would be achieved, walked out
of the meeting looking somber and left speechless.</p>

<p>For his part, Clinton left the meeting, probably realizing
that there was no point in talking Netanyahu into changing his
position.<br>
Like Arafat, he refused to speak to the press, only contenting
with telling a group of American reporters that there was a lot
of mistrust and a number of complicated issues that were still
separating the two sides.</p>

<p><b><u>Netanyahu's Charade</u></b><br>
As both Arafat and Clinton left Erez for Bethlehem, where the
American president and his wife and daughter visited the Church
of the Nativity, Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon held a press conference,
during which each sought to outmatch the other in political extremism.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said that while he welcomed the public nullification
of the Palestinian Charter in Gaza, he demanded that the annulment
be translated on the ground into tangible facts.</p>

<p>He said the Palestinians ought to stop talking about Palestine,
stop seeking to re-divide Jerusalem, change their curricula and
change the maps in their classes where Palestine stands in place
of Israel.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also demanded that Palestinians indoctrinate their
children into loving Jews, and above all, he said, they must terminate
their plans to declare Palestinian Statehood next May.</p>

<p>If and when they did this, Netanyahu said, Israel would do
its part of the Wye River agreement. For the Palestinian Authority,
Netanyahu's remarks meant that he was reneging on the Wye agreement
altogether.</p>

<p>&quot;We knew from the very inception that we can never achieve
peace with this man&quot;, said Hasan Asfour, the senior Palestinian
negotiator, commenting on Netanyahu's statements following the
failed meeting at Beit Hanun.</p>

<p>In practical terms, however, the Palestinians had no choice
but to demand that the United States pressure Netanyahu into adhering
to the terms of the Wye River agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;We have an agreement at hand bearing Netanyahu's signature.
We are not concerned about early electioneering or any statements
from Netanyahu aimed at polarizing the Israeli population&quot;,
said Nabil Amre, PA minister of Parliamentarian affairs, in reaction
to Netanyahu's new demands from the Palestinians.</p>

<p>For its part, the Israeli opposition accused Netanyahu outright
of &quot;spoiling Clinton's visit.&quot;<br>
Ehud Barak, leader of the Labor Party, argued that Netanyahu was
more interested in keeping his narrow coalition intact than in
achieving peace with the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Barak described Netanyahu's and Sharon's vitriolic statements
at Erez as manifestations of early electioneering, saying they
were mainly addressing the far right in Israel.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Symbolic but historical</u></b><br>
Obviously, the Palestinian Authority attached paramount significance
to Clinton's visit to the autonomous enclaves, the first ever
by an American president still in his term. The PA had insisted
that Clinton arrive at the Gaza Airport aboard his Air Force-1
jumbo jet.</p>

<p>However, due to strong Israeli objections, Clinton decided
to come to Gaza aboard a U.S. Marine helicopter, causing a little
consternation among PA officials. When Clinton did arrive at the
Gaza airport, he was generally circumspect in his public statements,
obviously lest he unduly upset the Israelis or create the wrong
impressions among the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Clinton was given a brief tour in the small Gaza airport, but
insisted that the American and Palestinian national anthems not
be played in order that this not be interpreted to mean tacit
American recognition of the Palestinian struggle for Statehood.<br>
This circumspect posture on Clinton's part in no way made Arafat
shy away from exploiting the visit to the fullest. At the airport
main terminal hall, Clinton was asked to cut a red ribbon, signaling
the operational opening of the airport.</p>

<p>However, as Clinton did cut the ribbon in a somewhat nonchalant
manner, Arafat asked him to repeat the ceremonial act over and
over again, probably out of realization that the act, however
symbolic it may be, was very significant as it implied, Arafat
reasoned, some sort of American recognition of a prospective Palestinian
Statehood.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, the cutting of the ribbon at the airport was
not all that Arafat got infatuated with during Clinton's visit
to Gaza. In his speech before the &quot;people's conference&quot;
at the Gaza convention centre, President Clinton told the Palestinian
audience that he recognized &quot;the right of the Palestinian
people to determine their destiny.&quot;</p>

<p>On several occasions during his speech, President Clinton touched
the hearts and minds of the audience when he evoked Palestinian
suffering and made an analogy between suffering Israeli and Palestinian
children.</p>

<p>He did receive a standing ovation when he said that this was
the first time he visited a Palestinian city governed by Palestinians.<br>
Still, it remains to be seen how and indeed if Clinton's visit
to the autonomous enclaves will leave a lasting effect on the
way American policy toward Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

<p>That remains to be seen.</p>

<h3><center>December, a month of sad and happy anniversaries</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</i></b></center></p>

<p>It is ironic that while the world in mid-December celebrated
the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the Palestinians remembered how, 50 years ago, the same institution,
or the same powers that produced the UDHR, legitimized one of
the most brutal violations of human rights in modern history,
namely the creation of an entire population of refugees in order
to allow for the creation of a nation of Jewish immigrants. It
is even more ironic that U.S. President Harry Truman, who, after
Roosevelt, led the process of developing a universal declaration
on human rights, was the same one that at the same time led the
Western world in seeking to atone for the sins of Europe during
the Second World War by sanctioning one of the greatest injustices
ever perpetrated in the history of humanity, namely the banishment
of Palestinians from their homes to compensate the Jews for what
they had suffered at the hands of the Nazis.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the role played by Truman's administration
to secure the UN Partition (of Palestine) Resolution adopted on
29 November 1947. Then, Jews made up about 32% of the population
and owned no more than 5.6% of the land. The demographic character
of Palestine had already been mutilated by the influx of Jewish
immigrants during the British mandate. (Slide) The Partition Resolution
offered the Jews 56% of the territory, with the most fertile land.
It was President Truman who put unprecedented pressure on the
State Department to make sure that the necessary majority was
attainable. The coercion and duress brought on other nations in
the General Assembly was scandalous, according to the U.S. Secretary
of Defense himself. Between the Partition decision and the effective
end of British mandatory rule on 15 May 1948, the Zionists seized
territory in the zone allotted to the Arabs; for example, Jaffa
and Acre. Seizing the land was not enough for the Zionist project.</p>

<p>It had to be cleared of its inhabitants, so as to provide not
a traditional colony of the sort where a native labour force is
exploited, but a colony of settlement where immigrants take the
place of the natives. In order to achieve this end, the Zionist
State engaged in what can only be called 'State terrorism'. The
most glaring example was what was done at Deir Yassin.</p>

<p>On 9 April 1948, 254 of the inhabitants of the village of Deir
Yassin-men, women, children and the elderly-were massacred by
the troops of the Irgun, whose leader was Menachem Begin. In his
book The Revolt, Begin writes that without what was done at Deir
Yassin, there would not have been a State of Israel, and he adds,
&quot;Meanwhile, the Haganah was carrying out successful attacks
on the other fronts...The Arabs began fleeing in panic, shouting
Deir Yassin!&quot; By 1949, the Zionists had control over 80%
of Palestine, and 780,000 Palestinians had been driven out of
their country.</p>

<p>A total of about 900,000 Palestinians were displaced from their
homes upon the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. The UN-appointed
mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte, wrote about the refugees: &quot;It
would be an offence against the principles of elementary justice
if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right
to return to their homes while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine,
and, indeed, at least offer the threat of permanent replacement
of the Arab refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries.&quot;
His report (UN Document A.648, p. 14), which described the large-scale
looting, pillaging and plundering and &quot;instances of destruction
of villages without apparent military necessity&quot;, cost him
his life. On 17 September, Count Bernadotte and his French assistant,
Colonel Serot, were murdered in the part of Jerusalem occupied
by the Zionists.</p>

<p>The second wave of mass displacement of Palestinians occurred
as a result of the 1967 war during which Israel occupied the rest
of Palestine, the Sinai and the Golan Heights. A total of about
400,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes in the West
Bank and Gaza when these territories were seized by the Israelis
as a result of the 1967 war. It is now estimated that the population
of Palestinian refugees is well in excess of 4.5 million dispersed
around the world but mostly concentrated inside the West Bank,
the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.</p>

<p>The 50th anniversary on 11 December of the UN Partition Resolution,
just one day after the 50th anniversary of the UDHR on 10 December,
was an occasion for a discussion of proposed solutions to the
refugee problem. Although the Partition Resolution stipulated
the return, or compensation, of refugees, current proposals discount
completely the practicality of a return. Thus far, two proposals
have been promoted for resolving the Palestinian issue and for
putting an end to the plight of the refugees. The two-State solution
is one possibility and the bi-national State is another. The former
is assumed to be the end-product of the Oslo agreement. It would
entail the setting up of a Palestinian State within the territories
currently administered by the Palestinian Authority, a State that
has no sovereignty and one that is divided into bantustans separated
by Israeli-controlled territories, bypasses and Jewish settlements.
The return of Palestinian refugees to this State is said to be
impossible because of lack of space and a potential security threat
to the State of Israel.</p>

<p>Secret meetings have taken place in different European cities
over the past two years to discuss proposals as to how to deal
with the refugee problem in the final status negotiations of the
Oslo Agreement's schedule. It has been suggested that the discussions
reached the understanding of ruling out the possibility of return
and of the necessity of settling refugees wherever they happen
to live now as refugees or guest workers. The bi-national State
solution, which is advocated in the U.S. by Dr. Edward Said, in
the U.K. by Dr. Ghada al-Karmi and in Israel by the Arab member
of the Israeli Knesset Dr. Azmi Bishara, is based on recognizing
the impossibility of reversing or altering the status quo. Since
the 1967 territories have been infested with Jewish settlements
and bypasses, and since Palestinian population centres are widely
dispersed and separated by Israeli-controlled territories, a Palestinian
State, it is argued, is not an option. Therefore, a single State
in which both Arabs and Israelis live together is the best solution.</p>

<p>Similarly, the advocates of this solution see the impracticality
of the return of refugees. However, they call for recognizing
the right to return in a prelude to financially compensating those
who cannot return for practical reasons, and these happen to be
the majority, if not all, of the refugees. Although these are
two different approaches, they share the following:</p>

<p><b>1.</b> They recognize the legitimacy of the occupation of
Palestine, or at least part of it, by Israel; something which
the Palestinians continued to oppose until the PLO changed course
from a national liberation movement to a policing agency.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> They both surrender to the status quo as if the present
situation is destined to be eternal. This involves a violation
of the right of present as well as future Palestinian generations
to aspire for the liberation of their lands and the land of their
forefathers.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> They both downgrade the conflict in the Middle East
to some of its lateral symptoms, in this case the refugees. Although
one of the most disastrous consequences of the conflict is the
creation of such a huge refugee population, the real cause of
the conflict is the injustice inflicted as a result of the creation
of the State of Israel. Therefore any solution to the problem
must begin with addressing this illegitimate, illegal and inhumane
act.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> They both disarm the Palestinians, while placing
them in a boxing ring, as Munfir Shafiq suggests, with the Israeli
entity, by dissociating the problem from its Arab and Islamic
dimensions.</p>

<p>However, the other option which the majority of the Palestinians,
both inside and outside of Palestine, believe to remain available
to them is to continue the struggle until justice is served and
legitimate rights are restored. This option is problematic for
those who espouse the options of capitulation. In addition to
being overwhelmed by the power and might of the Israeli camp,
that is Israel and its supporters in the West, they find it hard
to adhere to the option of legitimate struggle because the banner
is no longer in 'nationalist-secularist' hands. This was eloquently
expressed by Dr. Azmi Bishara at a recent meeting in Washington.
He said there were two projects on the ground; the PA's project,
which he said he could not accept because it fell short of achieving
Palestinian rights; and the Hamas project, which he could not
be part of because he was a liberal who just could not imagine
himself as part of an Islamic project. He suggested that liberals
(or secularists) needed to come up with another project. This
is believed to be his main motive for espousing, together with
others, the bi-national State solution.</p>

<p>Hamas, which in December celebrated its 11th anniversary, needs
to convince those who are still in doubt that its project, in
spite of it being indeed Islamic, is not exclusive to Islamists.
It is a continuation of the Palestinian national liberation project,
which has not ceased since aggression was first committed, nor
will cease until Palestine is liberated. Hamas must provide all
Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian, with convincing proof
that it is the lawful inheritor of the Palestinian struggle for
justice. Millions of Palestinians, many of whom still treasure
the keys to the homes from which they, or their parents, were
once driven from, are looking for leadership, and Hamas seems
to be the only credible candidate.</p>

<h3><center>Infringing upon international law to fund the &quot;unfinished
business&quot;</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></center></p>

<p>It is a saga that has no end. Like a soap opera, it brings
with each day a dramatic twist and turn. International Zionists
call it the &quot;unfinished business&quot;. So huge are its dividends
that Western capitals have now become the favourite rendezvous
of bankers, insurers, journalists and diplomats; all vying to
cash in on the memory of the Jewish holocaust. Thus, what started
at Nuremberg in 1946 as a genuine attempt to award justice to
Nazi victims has finally turned into an excited search not only
to locate looted gold, but also find dormant bank accounts, insurance
policies, stolen art and other property of survivors and their
relatives.</p>

<p>Last month, the Jewish holocaust inquest entered a new phase
when two leading American automobile companies, Ford and General
Motors, were accused of profiting from &quot;slave labour&quot;
in their German subsidiaries during the Second Great War. The
disclosure was, apparently, timed to coincide with the 44-nation
conference in Washington on the fate of Nazi-looted property.</p>

<p>As expected, several senior officials in the U.S. administration
capitalized on the opportunity to reinforce Jewish claims for
compensation. While opening the conference, Secretary of State,
Madeleine Albright, urged countries all over the world to open
their archives so that the truth about the holocaust would be
known. Unlike her Under-Secretary of State, Stuart Eizenstat,
who demanded the maximum economic restitution possible, Mrs. Albright
managed somehow to appear slightly more diplomatic in presenting
both the form and content of her package. Hence, instead of dwelling
entirely on the issue of material restitution, she, quite rightly,
also recognized the need for honesty and justice, emphasizing
that &quot;Only by knowing and being honest about the past can
we gain peace in the present and confidence in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>As a descendant of former victims of war crimes, one could
not have asked for a more or less candid presentation from the
U.S. Secretary of State. But, the fact that the oppressed of yesterday
have themselves become the oppressors of today demands, moreover,
that Mrs. Albright should have, at the very least, expressed some
measure of human concern for the victims of Israeli persecution.
Having chosen not to do so, we are, therefore, obliged to ask,
what crimes did the Palestinians commit to warrant torture, expulsion
and banishment from their land? Or, to put it another way, why
should they be made to pay the heaviest price for crimes committed
by Hitler's war machine?</p>

<p><b><i><u>Counting the costs</u></i></b><br>
Ever since the Nakba (Catastrophe) of 1948, Palestinians in the
occupied lands and in exile have been generally reluctant to discuss
the question of compensation before all their land was liberated.
This was largely due to the fear of being held responsible by
future generations for selling their birthright; for which there
is absolutely no price. Notwithstanding, there is presently a
growing recognition that compensation must be a central and necessary
part of any final settlement of the outstanding issues with Israel.
Most estimates have been based on the calculation of Palestinian
property losses in 1948. They invariably include human capital
losses and moral reparations. The relative absence of figures
for similar losses suffered under the British Mandate does not,
in any way, minimize their importance. Be that as it may, none
of the available estimates can be considered exhaustive precisely
because the loss of Palestinian life, property and capital has
continued uninterruptedly until today.</p>

<p>A quick review of some of the available estimates does, nevertheless,
shed some light on the extent of damage and destruction caused
by the Zionist project. In the immediate years after the Nakba,
the UN Conciliation Committee for Palestine estimated the value
of lost Palestinian property at �122 million, approximately
$1.85 billion 1990 US dollars. During the same period, the Arab
League produced its own figures, which proved to be 20 times higher,
valued at $35 billion in 1990 dollars. Several other major studies
have since been published by Yusif Sayigh, Don Peretz, Sami Hadawi
and Atif Kubursi.</p>

<p>Although violence and terror have been the dominant weapons
used by the Zionists against the Palestinians, their methods and
intensity changed considerably with time and circumstances. The
period 1947-1948 still stands out in the collective memory of
the Palestinians for its extreme carnage and sweeping destruction.
Terrorist attacks were intensified against local cafes, markets,
buses, trains, hotels and apartment buildings. These were accompanied
by no less than 30 massacres against villages throughout the length
and breadth of the country.</p>

<p>After 1956, the pattern of terrorism took a more organized
and systematic military form. Backed by a gruesome campaign of
letter and parcel bombs against Palestinian and other Arab officials,
it escalated into military assaults against the Gaza Strip, Jordan
and Syria; ostensibly to exterminate the refugees. This process
eventually culminated in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, during
which internationally banned chemical weapons and cluster bombs
were used, notably in the south, against the Palestinian resistance
in Rashidiyeh camp. Officers from the invading forces later acknowledged
that they resorted to these methods after they had failed to crush
the resistance with conventional weapons. The investigating commission
led by the 1974 Nobel Peace Laureate, Sean MacBride, confirmed
that contrary to international law and methods of warfare, Israel
committed wanton acts of violence against Palestinian refugee
camps, hospitals, schools and cultural, religious and charitable
institutions.</p>

<p><b><i><u>Genocide</u></i></b><br>
Admittedly, one of the worst crimes that any Government can be
accused of is that of genocide or genocidal policies. The United
Nations General Assembly confirmed this when it unanimously adopted
Resolution 96-1 in 1946 declaring that the crime of genocide can
also occur independently of war crimes. It includes the destruction
of libraries, museums, schools, national monuments, places of
worship and other cultural institutions. Hence, it was on this
premise the Jewish Holocaust Educational Trust based its claim
before the international conference in Washington in November
1998. In responding, the U.S. Government severely criticized the
'lukewarm commitment' displayed by several east and central European
countries to the return of Jewish property confiscated by the
Nazis. Under-Secretary of State, Stuart Eizenstat, warned, &quot;The
return of this property is very important for countries that wish
to become part of the Western family of nations.&quot;</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the return of assets and stolen
property is not a right exclusive to either Jews or the &quot;Western
family of nations.&quot; Other victims of war crimes are equally
entitled to knowledge of their history in order to gain peace
in the present and confidence in the future. The Palestinians
are, of course, no exception. After being evicted from their homeland,
they established a considerable infrastructure in Lebanon not
only to provide jobs, education, training and medical services
but also social institutions to preserve their national heritage
and traditions. Under the pretext of eliminating the PLO, the
Israelis destroyed this entire social infrastructure in 1982.
Apart from their refusal to recognize the status of the Palestine
Red Crescent Society as a humanitarian body, they systematically
destroyed and transferred to Israel records, documents, artifacts,
and books associated with the Palestinian people. The destruction
of the Centre for Palestinian Studies and removal of its archives
is also well documented. All of this was part of a deliberate
campaign to disrupt the social organization of the Palestinians
and substantially weaken if not destroy their national identity.
On account of these atrocities, international jurists have unanimously
categorized Israel's policies toward the Palestinians in Lebanon,
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jerusalem and Mandatory
Palestine as genocidal.</p>

<p>By keeping the holocaust issue alive and preserving it in the
conscience of the guilt-ridden West, international Zionists have
succeeded in effectively silencing the critics of Israel. So effective
has this stratagem become that thousands of dignitaries, including
presidents and prime ministers, flock to the Yad Vashem memorial
in Jerusalem each year and yet do not feel the pain of Israeli
occupation. They cry tears of sadness and lay wreaths in memory
of fallen Jews and, quite remarkably, remain unmoved by the violation
of Palestinian civil and human rights in Jerusalem. These include
the violation of rights to a fair trial, administrative detention,
torture and denial of freedom of speech, expression and worship.
Once in the shade of the Yad Vashem, they, like terminally ill
patients under the sedative control of anesthetics, immediately
forget all the relevant international laws and resolutions which
proclaim that no territory, including Jerusalem, can be legally
acquired by war. In the circumstances, therefore, it appears that
the Palestinians may have to erect a memorial of their own heroes
and martyrs before the civilized nations would recognize their
fundamental rights. Perhaps the time has indeed come that they
should initiate moves within the United Nations for an international
Remembrance Day for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
killed by Zionists before and after 1948.</p>

<p>That human suffering and pain is as much a feature of the Palestinian
Nakba as it was of the Jewish holocaust is all too evident. Yet,
there are injustices in the Palestinian experience which are absolutely
peculiar to them. Professor Israel Shahak recalled that in order
to totally extinguish their memory, the invading Zionist did not
only destroy villages and massacre their inhabitants but even
erased their graveyrads.2 Furthermore, while Hitler did not settle
German civilians on land seized from French peasants, Israel as
an occupying power has maintained Jewish colonies in occupied
Palestinian land for over 30 years, a clear violation of the international
law, particularly Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (12
August 1949). That; &quot;The occupying power cannot proceed with
a transfer of one part of its own civil population into the territory
occupied by it.&quot;</p>

<p>Like the Jewish holocaust inquest, the issue of Jewish settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has also become a lucrative &quot;unfinished
business.&quot; Despite their illegal status in international
law, the United States has, since the Wye agreement, pledged yet
another $1.2 billion for Israel to dismantle its settlements in
the territories. Since no other member of the United Nations is
rewarded so generously and frequently for infringing the law,
one cannot but conclude that there are, in effect, special laws
for certain victims of war crimes and other laws for other victims.</p>

<p>As any other people would when they suffer injustice and oppression,
Palestinians naturally feel intensely embittered toward their
persecutors and those who endorse genocidal policies against them.
They have, in fact, become incapable of concealing their anguish
and resentment when legal double standards are used to deny them
their fundamental rights. As Mrs. Albright did at the Washington
conference, they also think aloud about the blood that is in their
veins, and they instinctively ask as she did; &quot;Does it matter
what kind of blood it is?&quot;</p>

<h3><center>Side Note: &quot;Wye&quot; Oslo is Way Too Bad</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Sami Howrani- <a HREF="showrani@alif.com">showrani@alif.com</a></i></b></center></p>

<p>It was a touching moment, some say. I thought it comical to
the point of entertainment. The Wye ordeal and its aftermath creates
a world of possibilities in this ongoing drama we affectionately
refer to as Oslo. With Clinton the Good, Bibi the Bad, and Arafat
the, well you know what, it was deja vu all over again.</p>

<p>I have grown to like Oslo, but for all the wrong reasons. Perversely,
there is a sense of sports-like adventure involved in Oslo not
unlike bungee jumping with minimal energy loss. It's a matter
of time before one stares the brink in the eyes again, and again,
and again.</p>

<p>Oslo and its nephew Wye have signaled the end of conspiracies
almost over night. You see, there has to be an element of mystery
to a conspiracy. As of Wye, many Arab conspiracy theorists have
been put out of business. Now the CIA is a publicized part of
the Oslo arrangement just as the Mossad was before. CIA and Mossad
regional offices in Amman and Ramallah are ready for applicants.
Next time an old Hajji at the corner caf� cries CIA conspiracy,
please remind him politely it's now modus operandi.</p>

<p>Another fringe benefit to Oslo is in the field of Israeli physics.
Only in the West Bank is 13.1% less than 5%. It all depends on
time and space. To be more specific, it's a matter of wasting
more time to grab more Palestinian real-estate space. Einstein,
while a genius, did not anticipate the Israeli version of Relativity.
I propose the GMAT and the GRE consider a section on Illogical
Reasoning to prepare the future generations of negotiators.</p>

<p>While Camp David seemed a decisive step, Oslo is the mother
of all processes. For Palestinians, Oslo is a process of a process
of a process. It's a permanent test of their worthiness to Israelis.
Oslo has left an indelible mark on the psyche of Palestinians
and Arabs. It was the crowning achievement of Arafat's failures
and that of his advisors. The more progress made under Oslo, the
greater the risk of explosion at a later stage possibly erasing
prior achievements.</p>

<p>This escalation has been the hallmark of this poor incrementalism
devised in Washington and adopted in Tunis. Many have predicted
Arafat will run out of rabbits before reaching the end point.
Well, they have exaggerated. Not only is he out of tricks before
the halfway point, he has taken it upon himself to kill the few
rabbits still up his sleeve. Arafat's systematic liquidation of
the Palestinian resistance will prove costly. Good intentions
can never be an excuse for incompetence, again, and again, and
again.</p>

<p>Now that Oslo is part and parcel of the Palestinian experience,
and in recognition of the immense contributions of this accord
to our political nomenclature, I propose the following engraving
on future coins of the PA: &quot;In Oslo We Trusted.&quot; Such
coins could make a great addition to any collector's set.</p>

<p>Many of us have grown to like Oslo. Sure it's a nerve-racking
experience, but it would have been a dull life in its absence.
The Palestinians have been living on the brink of annihilation
since the founding of Israel either from direct confrontation
with the Jewish State or nearby Arab regimes. It's only befitting
even during a political settlement that Palestinians continue
to walk a tightrope under the threat of total violence.</p>

<p>May 1999 is the Palestinian's date with another cataclysm.
With Arafat cornering himself and the Palestinians, again, into
a corner, the future looks less promising as the expiration date
of the Oslo can of worms looms near.</p>

<p>While the world gears up for year 2000 bug glitches and stoppages,
Palestinians are left with the almost surreal scenario of the
last fight for their existence. In May 1999, an all or nothing
battle, albeit one-sided, will ensue with an enemy trained in
killer and unrefined ways. Welcome to the &quot;May 1999 Arafat
Bug&quot; and there seems to be no antiviral fix in sight to download.
What a thoughtful gift to the Palestinians that promises to keep
on giving even after Arafat is gone.</p>

<p>In light of this historic moment, I call upon Mustafa Akkad,
the great director, to start plans immediately for the first Arab
science fiction epic movie. It should be titled, &quot;Oslo Strikes
Back, again, and again, and again, &#133;&quot;</p>

<p>The closing dialog should read something like this:</p>

<p>KIRK: Beam me up Scotty.<br>
<i>(silence) </i><br>
KIRK: Scotty, are you there. Scotty, get me out of here NOW. <br>
<i>(silence)</i> <br>
KIRK: Scotty, that's an ORDER. <br>
SCOTTY: I am behind you Captain . You don't have to shout like
this. <br>
KIRK: OH NO! IF YOU ARE HERE SCOTTY, WHO IS UP THERE?!? <br>
ARAFAT: Hello, my friend and partner Captain Kirk, this is your
partner President, not Chairman, Arafat. You have nothing to worry
about. Your safety is my safety. I know how to run the Starship
Enterprise, the ship of the brave. <br>
KIRK: DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING ALIEN BEING. <br>
ARAFAT: I know what I am doing my dear partner Captain Kirk. I
promise to get you out of there in an Oslo minute. <br>
<i>(Collective cries of horror.) </i><br>
FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<h3><center><br>
A Salute to the &quot;Opposition&quot;</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Ramzy Baroud</i></b></center></p>

<p>Some call them radicals. Others call them the Opposition. President
Clinton referred to them on various occasions as the &quot;enemies
of peace&quot;. Yet, for many Palestinians, they represent the
uncompromising segment of the living conscience of Palestine.
They are the Palestinian National and Islamic parties that refused
to join the celebration of the newly signed peace accord at the
Wye River Plantation. They are a very well-educated group of Palestinians
that live inside Palestine and in Diaspora who have been carrying
the torture of revolution for many years passed and many years
to come.</p>

<p>In the midst of celebrations for Clinton's visit, so many questions
remained unanswered and unprecedented accomplishments remained
ignored. Politics are about give and take. Before celebrating
an event, a question needs to be asked: &quot;At what expense
will this event occur&quot;? It's hard to deny the importance
of President Bill Clinton's visit to Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

<p>At a time when Israel had insisted on isolating the Palestinian
territories as &quot;no ones' business, but Israel's&quot;, an
American President, accompanied by his wife, for the first time
visited this isolated land. Very significant, but at what expense?
With the issue of the prisoners still hanging, and settlements
still being built or expanded and security arrangements that are
allowing the mistreatment of Palestinians to satisfy Israel's
never-ending demands, Clinton's visit appears to be a kiss on
a bruised cheek.</p>

<p>The cheek is so bruised, in fact, it has lost its ability to
feel, even a presidential kiss.</p>

<p>Many of those who couldn't feel the kiss would rather worry
about treating the bruised cheek than proceed to run with small
American flags in the muddy streets of Gaza. Also, many were those
who rushed to attack any attempt to jeopardize the &quot;historical
achievement&quot; of Clinton's visit.</p>

<p>In Jordan, many Palestinian and Jordanian opposition leaders
were not allowed to cross borders to Syria. Those leaders were
on their way to join hundreds of Palestinians and Arabs who raised
their voices and condemned &quot;the unjust sacrifice of Palestinian
rights&quot;.. However, the difficulties created to prevent the
Damascus conference failed, turning the gathering into a great
achievement.</p>

<p>Clinton's visit to Gaza was an historical one for sure. But
the gathering of very different Palestinian ideologies in Damascus
on 12 December was a greater accomplishment, even though it lacked
the blessing and added glamour of the extensive media coverage.</p>

<p>The leaders of Hamas, Hizbollah and Islamic Jihad embraced
and shook hands with leaders from the Palestinian Popular Front
and Democratic Front. It was one great message sent to the Motherland,
which shows that our differences and frequent conflicts can never
stand in the way of our first and most important struggle for
Palestine.</p>

<p>The Damascus meeting also included an Arab and Islamic presence
which proves that Palestine is an Arab issue and an Islamic Issue,
as much as it is a Palestinian one. The former Algerian president,
Ahmed Bin Billa, and former Lebanese Prime Minister Ayman Al-Hafiz,
in addition to Arab and Muslim leaders from Jordan, Morocco and
Egypt, the Arab Gulf countries and Iran stood in support of the
Palestinian United Front and its demands.</p>

<p>The Palestinian &quot;opposition&quot; now has more reasons
to believe in the need for a more united front. Amending the Palestinian
Charter made them feel that refusal alone is not enough. If their
refusal is not combined with some serious steps to provide a solid
and effective base for the new era of resistance, no real fruits
of revolution could be cultivated.</p>

<p>The Damascus meetings resulted in the election of a group of
10 members to lead the newly formed alliance, including the Palestinian
symbol of resistance, Bassam Al-Shak'a, who lost both of his legs
in a Mossad-led assassination attempt a few years back. The right
to resist was never and will never be a right for some and denied
for others. Rich Palestinians and poor, Muslim and Christian,
men and women, have been part of a long fight to liberate Palestine
and defend the rights of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>The unwritten attempt that these generations have made to themselves
and their people have not been achieved. Therefore, a call for
their unity is badly needed, and an alternative route must be
found.</p>

<p>Palestine belongs to all Palestinians, including the millions
of refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and around the world. If
we don't expect them to act fast and to try to take a stand when
their fate is being decided, perhaps forever, when should we expect
them to? The almost quarter of a million Palestinians who have
been killed since 1948 at the hands of Israelis &quot;also had
a dream&quot;.. Their dream was turned into a nightmare but many
millions remain with the same dream in Ayn al-Hilweh and Al-Wihdat
camps in Jordan and Al-Yarmouk camp in Syria. If they don't hurry
to defend and protect the dream, no one else will.</p>

<p>So before we rush to judge and to condemn, before we describe
them as radicals and enemies of peace, we must listen to their
story. The story of suffering through Black September, South Lebanon
and the Intifadah. Once we listen, I believe, all that we can
do is to stand for them and salute, salute them for a heavy price
they have paid, rather than those who took the easy way out.</p>

<h3><center>The Crusaders Are Back</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Fatima Hamilton</i></b></center></p>

<p>The old religious hatred of the ancestral Crusaders against
Islam and Muslims is back. It has returned under a new guise of
so-called diplomacy and humanitarianism, which is nothing more
than cruel inhumanity as we watch American and British troops
bombard the poor, suffering Iraqi people. This is not only the
work of &quot;Crusaders&quot;, but also the Zionists, who are
their partners in crime. The aims of this new attack are very
clear: the Crusaders' old hatred and desire to rid the world of
Islam and Muslims, the Zionists' desire to fulfill their dreams,
and the petty desire of Bill Clinton to escape his pending impeachment.<br>
First, we find the &quot;Crusaders&quot;, who are following a
so-called humanitarian policy to rid the world of Saddam Hussein,
striking a poor and defenseless Iraq. If they are so humanitarian
and do not want innocent people killed by Saddam's weapons, then
why are they in turn killing and injuring innocent Iraqi people?
Double standard?</p>

<p>Whenever there is a war against Muslims that does not involve
American or Western interests, we find them turning a blind eye
as in Bosnia, Kashmir, Kosovo, Burma and so many other places
in the world where Muslims suffer. They are not &quot;humanitarian&quot;
unless it involves people who think, dress and act like them-a
true WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant). Western Powers try to
fight Islam everywhere; for example, France does not allow women
to wear Islamic dress if they want to attend university, if they
want to work or to get a driver's license. Turkey, which desires
to become a Westernized and secular State (though they were historically
an Islamic leader) has also fought against women wearing Islamic
dress as well as fighting against other Islamic activities. During
the Gulf war in America, Muslims were harassed, beaten and sometimes
killed, as well as mosques and Islamic centres were vandalized.
And this happened in a country that supposedly supports freedom
of religion.</p>

<p>In America, if one looks really close, he'll find that freedom
is actually very limited there. Some Christian organizations raise
money to fight against Islam. What is this, if it isn't war? Muslims
respect the Christian and Jewish religions because they come from
one source-Allah, who is our Creator. Yet, they do not respect
Islam. Historically, Christians and Jews who lived among Muslims
were able to practice their religions freely and were respected
without persecution. If they are so humanitarian and free, then
why doesn't the West leave the Muslims to be free in their countries?</p>

<p>They fear Islam, for some reason-mostly ignorance of the true
Islam as well as intentional media misinformation-and they want
to destroy it before the Muslims who have lost their way rediscover
its greatness. What they don't understand is that Islam came from
Allah (God) and it can never be destroyed, now matter how hard
they try.</p>

<p>They strike now at Iraq to destroy Muslims and to destabilize
the region. These strikes will affect the whole region in one
way or another. If we are kept busy just trying to rebuild, to
live, to eat, to work, etc., then we cannot think of advancing
ourselves. This is what the West wants; they don't want any competition.
Iraq used to be the strongest country in the Middle East. Now
other rising countries will be future targets of these &quot;Crusaders&quot;,
namely Iran, Syria, Pakistan and Sudan and maybe even Afghanistan.
Any country that technologically advances and/or exhibits any
Islamic strength or inclination, the West wants to find some excuse
to break them.</p>

<p>History has a way of repeating itself, so these strong Western
powers, in particular America, will find themselves declining
one day, just as Rome once fell. All great nations fall while
new ones rise. They cannot stay on top forever, and they know
it. That's why they are taking such desperate measures.</p>

<p>The second aim of these barbaric, cruel attacks, perpetrated
by cowards who strike sleeping people in the night, is being pushed
and supported by the Zionist State of Israel. They have supporters
in America, and in the West, as well as many supporters in the
American Government who hold key positions. They are trying to
fulfill their &quot;dream&quot;. They are greedy and selfish and
are not satisfied with only taking the land they've already taken
from Palestinians, but also they want to take the rest of the
Middle East.</p>

<p>Well, they've almost taken Jordan now without fighting; they've
bought so much land in Jordan and have infiltrated it. They are
having problems with Iraq and Syria, so they must battle for it.
They are very afraid of Iraq and see it as a threat because Iraq
has always, historically, refused to normalize with Israel.</p>

<p>Also, in their State motto, the Israelis claim that their borders
are from &quot;the Nile to the Euphrates.&quot; The Nile, meaning
they want to take Egypt and maybe other parts of Africa some day,
as well as up to the Euphrates, which includes all the area into
Iraq.</p>

<p>So, they do not mind to have a war and to kill innocent people
to achieve their dreams. They daily kill and torture people in
Palestine and they're still bombing South Lebanon regularly.</p>

<p>Instead of risking their own lives in a war with Iraq, they
push the Americans, their &quot;servants&quot;, to do their dirty
work for them. They don't even like Americans; they only use them
for the advantages they provide. In their religion (not the original
one but the one they have now), they believe that all non-Jews
are animals. We can see this reflected in their attitude with
all non-Jews.</p>

<p>For example, Golda Meir, Former Prime Minister of Israel, once
stated that &quot;Four million Arabs are not worth one Jewish
fingernail.&quot; We can hear this kind of thinking echoed in
a recent statement by Madeleine Albright. A reporter asked her
if risking the lives of one million Iraqi children was worth striking
Iraq. She said that if it got rid of Saddam, then it is worth
it. What about the value of human lives? Or, does it just matter
what country these people come from in order to be considered
as humans??</p>

<p>Let us recall how Shakespeare defended the Jews in his character
Shylock from &quot;The Merchant of Venice.&quot; The Jews, who
were persecuted, wanted to be considered equal with the Westerners
and to be considered as humans. So, Shylock says to the Christians
in the court:</p>

<p>&quot;Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
subject to the same disease, healed by the same winter and summer
as a Christian is? If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle
us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you
wrong us, shall we not revenge. If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what
is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should
his sufferance be by Christian example? Why revenge. The villainy
you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better
the instruction.&quot;</p>

<p>This Jewish character tried to say that Jews are human. So,
why is it that Zionists refuse to recognize the humanity of others,
especially their cousin race-the Arabs? Arabs bleed and cry as
they do. Aren't they human, too? Don't they have a right to live?
Both Zionists and Western Powers do not seem to recognize anyone's
humanity except for their own.</p>

<p>If they really want to get rid of Saddam and hate him so much,
then why don't they just send their agents to kill him and spare
the lives of the poor, suffering people? Don't get me wrong. I'm
not saying it's right for them to assassinate anyone, but instead
of millions suffering because of one man, doesn't it seem logical
to spare the suffering population and to get rid of what they
consider &quot;a thorn in their side?&quot;</p>

<p>The last aim, which ties in with the first two, is Bill Clinton
trying to escape his impeachment. He wants to rebuild his image
in front of the public. He was pressured to strike Iraq by certain
groups and people. Isn't it strange that after he went to Gaza
to meet with Netanyahu and Arafat that he suddenly decides to
strike Iraq? Maybe certain people promised him they'd sweep away
his impeachment if he catered to their wishes. Clinton has been
pressured since the beginning of his problems, and finally he
took the big decision to strike.</p>

<p>What a coward! He is a man who dodged the Vietnam draft and
has never served in the military. Yet, he sends others to fight
for him. He has neither honour nor respect! What kind of a cruel
human can strike a defenseless country while its people are sleeping,
repeatedly strike them and do so at the beginning of their religious
month of fasting, Ramadan? Where is the respect for God and for
religion? There is none!</p>

<p>While he saves his job, tries to reclaim what little reputation
he has left after the Lewinsky affair, and is safe in his home
with his family, others are being killed and injured. Their lives
are being turned upside-down, and they can't live out their dreams
of a nice job, a nice home or even to be with their families.
Clinton, as well as other Western powers, is selfish and does
not think of the suffering of others. Collectively, they only
think of how to inflict suffering upon others.</p>

<p>Most of Europe and Canada backed the U.S. They struck without
bothering to get United Nations approval. Kofi Anan tried to get
a diplomatic solution and was visibly distressed at how things
turned out. He tried to be fair, but how can he voice his opinions
when he is in a den of lions? The UN has just shown that it is
only a representative of America. The rest of the world has no
opinion anymore.</p>

<p>China and Russia spoke out against these strikes. Yet, what
will they do to help right this injustice? And why should they
help while our own Arab governments are refusing to fight back
or even to speak out against this atrocity?</p>

<p>When will the Arab Governments stop hanging onto America's
shirt-tails and grab some Arab pride to stand on their own?</p>

<p>When will they awaken from their deep sleep? The people are
slowly awakening, but how can they get their Governments to also
wake up?</p>

<h3><center>And They Call Ben Laden A Terrorist!<br>
<i><font SIZE="+0">By Erik Paul</font></i></center></h3>

<p>War is the greatest form of terrorism and the latest U.S. led
military air strikes against the Iraqi people are acts of terror
aimed at destroying what is left of the Iraqi socio-economic infrastructure.
The country guilty of the greatest acts of terror is America.</p>

<p>America is the same evil power who has continually supported
Israeli intransigence, its military occupation of a land not Israeli,
and aided and abetted further subversive acts of terror against
the Palestinian and Lebanese people. America, in fact, has never
been a paragon of moral virtue. We only have to look back at the
horror of the Vietnam war to remember how the Americans relentlessly
dumped thousands of tons of chemicals not only on the North Vietnamese,
but on the South Vietnamese too. And how can we forget the not
so long ago Gulf War?</p>

<p>As for Britain's part in the whole scenario, well, it is merely
the tail that the dog wags.</p>

<p>It is no great surprise that American President Bill Clinton
chose to strike the Iraqi people just hours before the House of
Representatives was to vote either for or against his impeachment.
It is indeed a sad irony that a guilty man desperate to deflect
attention away from his own sins decided to bomb innocent people
when only hours earlier, that same man placed an ornament on a
Christmas tree in the city of Bethlehem, the birthplace of Prophet
Jesus. It is another sad irony that Christmas is supposed to be
a time of peace, joy and love and when those who celebrate it
often try to turn over a new leaf of giving and compassion. The
evil and satanic strikes against Iraq coincide with the Christmas
season and also the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</p>

<p>Surely there can be no such thing as peace and joy in the American
White House this year with visions of former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and her illicit sexual escapades (What a father
figure he poses for his daughter Chelsea and what a role model
he symbolizes for American youth!) with the deviant Bill Clinton
all too engraved in the minds of the Clinton family and impeachment
no longer a vague possibility but an accomplished fact. Too, how
can any killer of innocent people, of babies and children ever
sing songs of Christmas when the blood of the innocent indelibly
stains his hands?</p>

<p>The decoy of the American air strikes in Iraq only temporarily
deflected attention and impending impeachment for Bill Clinton.
That the American president also did not even try to secure the
necessary approval and full support of the House of Representatives
does not do him any good politically. His efforts to play the
role of the great hero by his mass genocide of helpless Iraqis
only momentarily delayed the process of impeachment.</p>

<p>Israelis and Zionists can now openly applaud the air strikes
against Iraq as not only they but the Jewish lobby in the U.S.
have been pushing for such an attack for a long time.</p>

<p>It is a very black day for the Arab people. They are also to
blame for giving America the opportunity and the means to fight
one of their fellow Arab brothers. Despotic selfish Arab leaders
too long greedy for power and money have lost sight of the significance
of being united and facing evil forces as one people. While the
blood of innocent Iraqis stains Clinton's devious hands, it also
cannot be washed from the hands of Arab leaders. It is the impotency
of the Arab leaders that sold Palestine to the Jews in the first
place and it is this same impotency that is selling the remnants
of what is left of Palestine to Israelis who respect no treaties
or ethics.</p>

<p>This Christmas, there is no peace on earth and no good will
towards men. The spirit of Christmas is dead and fasting during
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan will be filled with regret and
shame for Muslims around the world.</p>

<p>Compared to Clinton, Osama Ben Laden's efforts are nowhere
near terror. The real terrorist on a big time scale is none other
then Bill Clinton and it is he who should go into hiding for his
crimes against his own people and humanity.</p>

<p>The more appropriate title for Operation Desert Fox is Operation
Monica. But even Bill Clinton was not able divert attention for
long from his own inevitable impeachment. What is even scarier,
is that Vice President Al Gore, a Jew in hiding, will take Clinton's
place if the American Senate decides to send him to trail and
then Israelis and Zionists can really have a field day.</p>

<p>There will be nothing to stop them.</p>

<p><b><u>A visit to the refugee camps near Amman</u></b></p>

<h3><center>No to Jordanization</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Asma Agbarieh</i></b></center></p>

<p>After 50 years of dispossession, the fundamental hope of every
Palestinian refugee-the right to return-seems more distant than
ever. The areas encompassed by the Oslo accords and the Israel-Jordan
treaty include 2.5 million of the poorest refugees, 80% of those
registered by UNRWA (the United Nations Relief Works Agency).
These agreements have succeeded in shunting them out of sight
and out of mind-a remarkable feat, considering that their plight
is at the root of the conflict.</p>

<p>The authorities in Jordan are pressuring the Palestinians who
live in the camps to give up their refugee status, become full-fledged
Jordanians, replace their shacks with brick houses, become, in
a word, normal. One would expect, indeed, that after half a century
of misery, they would want to improve their living conditions.
Paradoxically, however, to go this route would be to undermine
the hope that has given meaning to their lives. Ever since their
expulsion from Palestine in 1948, their status as refugees has
formed the core of the conflict, and if they give it up, this
will signal a surrender of their right to return. With resolution
194, the United Nations confirmed this right. After the Arab States
failed them in 1967, the PLO rose to give them a voice. The Zionists,
on the other hand-on every occasion, in every international forum-have
insisted that their host countries should assimilate them, that
they should forget Palestine.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Principles at Oslo (1993) was a staggering
blow. It deferred the refugee question, separating it from the
issues of land and authority, which have preoccupied both sides
ever since. The effect has been to redefine the conflict: not
as one between Israel and the Palestinian people as a whole, most
of whom remain in exile, but as a dispute between Israel and the
2 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The others
will have to fend for themselves. The refugees in the camps are
no longer to constitute a political issue, but rather a mere humanitarian
one, which can be solved, therefore, by the Arab States or the
international community.</p>

<p>This is precisely what Jordan, as a result of its treaty with
Israel, is attempting to bring about. It has demolished camp houses
to make way for new roads. It has offered the Palestinians long-term
loans to buy homes, which would nullify their former status.</p>

<p>The refugees call this process taw'tin (naturalization). If
they succumb to it, they will be paying a terrible price-the irrevocable
surrender of the right of return.</p>

<p>They reject the Jordanian programme out of hand. They answer
with sumud (steadfastness, perseverance, determination). They
curse the Oslo agreement, and they hold on to their UNRWA cards
as proof that they belong somewhere and as their tickets of return.</p>

<p>From the Jordanian capital of Amman it's a short trip to the
squalor of the refugee camps that surround it. There are 1,328,766
refugees in Jordan, half of whom live in camps. Unemployment stands
at 50%.</p>

<p>The human meaning of these statistics is plain to see: Idle
people everywhere. Terrible poverty. Children collect plastic
containers for recycling and old bread to sell as animal food;
it takes them days to fill a sack, which fetches 1 Jordanian dinar
($1.70).</p>

<p>It is considered all right to accept support from UNRWA, since
that goes with the refugee status, a source of pride. But it is
regarded as a disgrace to be in a condition where one must accept
mere charity. Nonetheless, many families have no choice nowadays
but to look forward impatiently to the holy month of Ramadan,
the traditional time for handouts.</p>

<p>In one camp, al-Baqaa, where unemployment is &quot;only&quot;
40%, people rent a newspaper instead of buying it. The bright
side is, in spite of the poverty, people still read the paper.</p>

<p>In the house of Fatima Sliman, at Hussein camp, memory mingles
with fear. Her story is interwoven with that of her people. She
was born in 1946 in Kartieh (a village near Beer Sheba in southern
Israel). During the war two years later, Fatima lost her father
and her homeland in a single blow. When the family fled from the
fighting, her father returned to the village in search of food.
No one ever saw him again.</p>

<p>Then began her life as a refugee. In September 1970 (later
known as &quot;Black September&quot;), King Hussein attacked the
PLO and drove its leaders out of the country. The 10-day bombardment
killed Fatima's mother and child. A bullet destroyed her right
eye. It remains in her skull today. The doctors were afraid to
remove it, fearing the loss of the left eye too.</p>

<p>Fatima views the current Jordanian policy with disdain: &quot;As
if all we went through is not enough, now they want to kill us
with 'development'.&quot;</p>

<p>By 'development', Fatima is referring to a new highway that
cuts right through the Hussein camp. The road will connect Amman
to Irbid in the north. The latter happens to be the tax-free zone
for Israeli-Jordanian ventures. People in the camp call it &quot;Israel's
road&quot;. Houses on both sides have received demolition orders-all
in the name of development.</p>

<p>Hania Saleh is a refugee from the village of Sarafand-today
a huge Israeli military base. She asks: &quot;Why do we need such
a road? For our great big trucks? For our helicopters to land
on? All we need is a roof over our heads. The Government is trying
to lure people into taking compensation and leave, but most don't
agree. Those who do leave the camp 'bite their fingers' in remorse.
The Government wants us out so badly, they're offering 9,000 dinars
for a house that's worth 2,000.&quot;</p>

<p>It's late afternoon at Mahatta, one of five &quot;unrecognized&quot;
camps. Lacking schools and clinics, they have to rely on other
camps for such services. Hani al Hindi, from the Camp Committee,
tells a familiar tale: Under the slogan of 'development', the
authorities are trying to squeeze the refugees out of the camps.
&quot;On 15 March 1996&quot;, he says, &quot;we were honoured
with a visit by Amman's then-mayor Mamduh al-Abbadi. He talked
about repairing the infrastructure, building new roads and broadening
the entrances. All this development falls under a new law called
'The Social Security Pact'. We didn't have any doubt about the
real purpose of his visit: dispersing the camp. He hinted at the
need to demolish 200 houses. The camp decided to resist. We elected
a committee to defeat these plans. When the municipality saw the
extent of the opposition, they passed the task of implementation
on to the Ministry of Housing.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me make myself clear: We do not oppose development.
We are all for improving conditions, but the purpose of any change
should be to help us endure, until we can go back to our homeland-not
as a way to undermine our return.&quot;</p>

<p>As I was walking with Hani al-Hindi in the poor alleyways of
the camp, we saw an elderly man sitting on his doorstep. His eyes
seemed far away, but something in his look, a kind of wariness,
made me stop. Fuad Abed al Rahman is a refugee from the vanished
village of Kbab near Ramleh. He tells his story: &quot;After the
fighting in Abu Shusheh, we fled to Beit Shanah.&quot; The villages,
you can tell, still live in his mind, like everyday places where
you go to buy radishes or get your hair cut, places that everyone
will recognize at once. &quot;When we returned after three days,
we found our village destroyed. I saw a body in the well. We left
and camped in Uqbat Jaber (beside Jericho). Then we crossed the
river and built this camp here in 1951.&quot; Fuad Abed al Rahman
told his story without emotion, but then I asked him whether he'd
be willing to move into a new modern house in exchange for his
right of return. His eyes lit up. &quot;I'd sooner see my children
die.&quot; He pointed at a potted plant nearby: &quot;Look at
that plant. Its stem is weak, and its leaves are wilted, but its
roots are alive. This plant has no choice but to live and to grow.</p>

<p><i>We too. We have no choice except to return!&quot;</i></p>

<h3><center>Now that the Iraq Attack is &quot;Paused&quot;</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Ray Hanania</i></b></center></p>

<p>Now that the American-British bombing of Iraq has come to a
brief &quot;pause,&quot; what next?</p>

<p>Did the attack achieve its goals?</p>

<p>Ironically, Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein is correct in one
very important aspect: The attack against Iraq is a &quot;failure.&quot;</p>

<p>It is a failure because it did not redress the causes that
prompted the attack: United Nation's inspectors led by Richard
Butler were denied access to an area Butler insisted was of utmost
urgency to inspect. Upon being denied access, the UNSCOM Inspectors
fled the country, and the bombing was initiated.</p>

<p>The timing of Butler's action was odd, because it happened
to come just when President Clinton needed some crisis to distract
American emotions from the ongoing crescendo of the televised
congressional hearings into his impeachment.</p>

<p>With the backing only of Britain's Tony Blair, Clinton ordered
the bombing. He further insulted Muslims around the world by asserting
that he wanted to bomb now rather than later to avoid bombing
during Ramadan and desecrating the reverence of the Islamic Holy
month.</p>

<p><b><u>What was achieved?</u></b></p>

<p>The question begs an answer: Now that the bombing has come
to an end, what was accomplished?<br>
Well, for one thing, Richard Butler still can't get in to inspect
the sites he claims he must inspect. Saddam Hussein, riding high,
again, has declared that Butler's inspectors will never return.
We'll see, of course.</p>

<p>Dozens of Iraqi civilians were murdered in the unprovoked American
and British air strikes.</p>

<p>And, President Clinton was able to achieve his own domestic
goals. The bombing ended just after the Impeachment vote. Only
two of the four original impeachment resolutions were approved.
I would venture to say that had Clinton not bombed Iraq, all four
would have passed. But Clinton's attacks made it difficult for
Republicans to turn the heat up during the Iraqi attacks.</p>

<p>Clinton is now galvanizing an emotionally charged American
public in the hopes of further using them to pressure the US Senate
to abandon an impeachment trial.</p>

<p><b><u>The Shadow of My Lai</u></b></p>

<p>The last time the United States tried to bully a small country
was in the 1960s when we invaded and bombed Hanoi in Vietnam.
The might of the American Military-Industrial Complex was unleashed
upon sandal wearing peasant farmers in Vietnam's rice paddies
... and the Vietnamese won.</p>

<p>They defeated the Americans, and sent the US Marines whimpering
in disgrace, tails between their legs, clinging to the skids of
helicopters that barely made it off the top of the US Embassy
in Saigon.</p>

<p>Oh, and who could forget the Vietnamese who the Americans enlisted
to help fight the Viet Cong? How the Americans abandoned those
allies when this great American champion of &quot;hypocrisy&quot;
decided it was time to depart?</p>

<p>And even leaving could never erase the memories of the war
crimes committed by American Marine Officers at Vietnamese villages
like My Lai. That massacre occurred some 30 years ago.</p>

<p>At 7:30 AM, March 16, 1968, Charlie Company, Task Force Baker,
Eleventh Brigade of the America Division, entered My Lai, a tiny
village on the northeastern coast of Vietnam, near the South China
Sea, by helicopter. The Charlie Company massacred 347 civilian
women, children and old men.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the end for America's military drive
to crush the will of the Vietnamese people.</p>

<p>Like many Americans, I served in the U.S. military during the
Vietnama War. I was lucky. My service came during the end of the
war, as we were running yellow tail out of the South East Asian
nightmare that we created, and I was left stateside.</p>

<p>Vietnam was a terrible war, where many Americans lost their
lives fighting for something that they were told was the right
thing to do, in much the same way as US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright contends the bombing of Iraq is also the right thing
to do.</p>

<p>The same arrogance that motivated our politicians back then,
motivates them today: I can never forgive Ms. Albright for correlating
Iraqi civilian deaths to the term &quot;avoiding collateral damage.&quot;</p>

<p><b><u>Will Americans ever learn?</u></b></p>

<p>Will Americans ever recognize when they are being manipulated
by politicians desperate to cling to their high priced jobs?<br>
President Clinton boasts that the 72-hour bombing of Iraq has
resulted in destroying Iraq's ability to create weapons of mass
destruction.<br>
Oh, really?</p>

<p>Does that now mean the embargo can end?</p>

<p>Or is that claim like all of Clinton's other claims? Just more
meaningless, political rhetoric?</p>

<h3><center>Lesson for other nations</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Aisha Khan</i></b></center></p>

<p>With the bombing of Iraq on 16 December, the United States
has shown once again that might is right; that in the global jungle,
the U.S. is the king; that it is bound by neither world opinion
nor international law nor conventions nor humanitarian considerations.</p>

<p>The ostensible justification of the bombings was the need to
put Saddam in his place for not cooperating with United Nations
weapons inspectors. But the saddest part of this sordid episode-even
assuming Iraq had thwarted the UN-is that the actual reason for
the bombing can be found in the chambers of the U.S. Congress,
where a debate on Bill Clinton's impeachment began the very same
day.</p>

<p>Inside Congress, passionate Democrats debated about 'subversion
of democracy', 'overturning the Constitution', 'poison of personal
vendetta' and 'victimization'.</p>

<p>Outside, their object of concern was raining bombs on a country
already starving and devastated, knowing full well that the only
losers would be the Iraqi people. The reasons cited by the U.S.
for the bombings do not stand up under the slightest scrutiny.
Nobody can seriously believe that Iraq poses a threat to any country,
neighbouring or otherwise. What threat can a country that was
comprehensively destroyed in 1991 and has since then been continuously
and systematically strangled by sanctions pose? It could not even
put up a resistance in 1991, what could it have done now?</p>

<p>Clinton claimed the bombings were for the security of Iraq's
Arab neighbours. But not one of these neighbours has welcomed
the attacks, nor was any one of them consulted before the decision
to bomb was taken.</p>

<p>Who actually poses a security threat to the Arab region? Is
it not Israel with its secret stockpile of nuclear weapons as
well as chemical and biological arms? What about the U.S. itself,
which has over 17,000 nuclear bombs and in fact used warheads
made of depleted Uranium both in 1991 and in the recent bombings?
Are these not weapons of mass destruction?</p>

<p>Clinton claims that Saddam violated UN resolutions regarding
the work of UNSCOM and therefore had to be taught a lesson. First,
after eight years of harassment and provocation, UNSCOM has not
been able to unearth any weapons of mass destruction. Secondly,
the UN did not sanction the use of force in the case of non-cooperation,
therefore the U.S. actions are in gross violation of international
law and the UN Charter.</p>

<p>In fact, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan went on record to
say on 16 December that it was a very sad day for him and the
UN. Which UN mandate is the U.S. talking about?</p>

<p>Apart from that, Slobodan Milosevic-the Serbian incarnation
of Hitler-has been merrily violating umpteen UN resolutions regarding
Kosovo. Why isn't he being taught a lesson? In spite of the fact
that hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have been systematically
uprooted, driven out or killed, this does not merit anything more
than hollow threats.</p>

<p>While for Iraq, a partisan report written by UNSCOM head Richard
Butler (with the help of U.S. security officials) is enough to
provoke a response within a matter of hours.</p>

<p>The U.S. has made much of Saddam being the worst incarnation
of Hitler given the fact that he has not spared even his own people.
It's interesting to note that the U.S. and the UK only discovered
this facet of Saddam after he was through with gassing Kurds and
Shiites and fighting a protracted war with Iran. All that while,
the West aided him in building his stockpile of &quot;weapons
of mass destruction&quot; and using it on innocents. The moment
their oil interests were in danger, the West discovered that he
was a murderous maniac.</p>

<p>But do these bombings really harm Saddam, who will be safely
ensconced in his presidential bunker, or innocent civilians? Everyone
knows the answer. In fact, some commentators, such as Robert Kagan
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, conclude that
he may emerge stronger than ever.</p>

<p>One American commentator has made an interesting point; that
being the U.S. and the UK are 'engaged in a deadly form of biological
warfare in Iraq. The destruction of infrastructure and the ban
of imports to repair it has caused disease, malnutrition and death
on a huge scale.' In fact, Denis Halliday, who ran the UN oil-for-food
programme in Iraq until he realized that thousands of Iraqi children
were dying every month because of the sanctions, resigned, saying
&quot;We are in the process of destroying an entire society. It
is illegal and immoral.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton lost the battle against impeachment and, hopefully,
in the long run, will lose the battle for world hegemony. That
is if the Third World and other lesser powers learn a lesson from
this brazen act of aggression. No country is safe or immune from
becoming the next target. If world opinion is not forged and expressed
strongly enough, the only message the U.S. will get is that it
can repeatedly get away with such acts.</p>

<p>The time has come for post-colonial nations to forge strong
alliances amongst themselves and stand up to this kind of bullying
and jungle law. Organizations such as the Non-Aligned Movement
have to be revitalized to build South-South cooperation and end
Western economic and political hegemony.</p>

<p>The aggression might be worth the loss and destruction if it
can shake Asian and African countries out of their abject servility
towards the U.S. The Arab countries, in particular, must learn
the lesson of how a former blue-eyed darling of the West has now
become the favourite scapegoat and punching bag.</p>

<p>India, ever since the process of 'liberalization' began, has
been wont to bend over backwards to win the approval and dollars
of the U.S. and its monetary bodies. But it also should learn
a lesson. Tomorrow the U.S. could impose sanctions or worse bomb
it claiming that its human rights record is bad, or to destroy
the weapons of mass destruction it has. The attack may even give
a boost to the U.S.'s worst nightmare: Islamic revival movements
in the Arab countries.</p>

<p>Increasingly, movements are forming that recognize the West's,
at best, disregard and, at worst, animosity towards Islam.</p>

<p>These continued acts of aggression would only help to sharpen
the focus of such movements, which could hopefully spell doom
for the puppet regimes the U.S. maintains in the Gulf. Hopefully,
other nationalist and anti-neocolonial movements will also get
a shot in the arm from this.</p>

<p>An interesting sidelight to this disgusting drama is Russia's
outspoken criticism of the attacks. Russia, along with China,
outrightly condemned the aggression and the former even recalled
its ambassador for consultation.</p>

<p>On Sunday (20 December), Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
arrived in New Delhi and immediately called for a strategic alliance
between India, China and Russia. If it materializes, it could
pose a serious discomfort to the U.S. It does seem unlikely in
the near future, but unless regional alliances independent of
U.S. control or hegemony grow, many more situations like that
in Iraq are bound to happen in the years to come.</p>

<p><b><i><u>Jewish History, Jewish Religion</u></i></b></p>

<h3><center>The Weight of History</center></h3>

<p><center><b>Part 11</b></center></p>

<p><center><b><i>By Israel Shahak</i></b></center></p>

<p><b><u>The Muslim World</u></b><br>
The same general scheme applies to Jewish communities during the
classical period in Muslim countries as well, except for the important
fact that expulsion of Jews, being contrary to Islamic law, was
virtually unknown there. (Medieval Catholic canon law, on the
other hand, neither commands nor forbids such expulsion.)</p>

<p>Jewish communities flourished in the famous, but socially misinterpreted,
Jewish Golden Age in Muslim countries under regimes which were
particularly dissociated from the great majority of the people
they ruled, and whose power rested on nothing but naked force
and a mercenary army. The best example is Muslim Spain, where
the very real Jewish Golden Age (of Hebrew poetry, grammar, philosophy
etc) begins precisely with the fall of the Spanish Umayyad caliphate
after the death of the <i>de facto</i> ruler, al-Mansur, in 1002,
and the establishment of the numerous<i> ta'ifa</i> (faction)
kingdoms, all based on naked force. The rise of the famous Jewish
commander-in-chief and prime minister of the kingdom of Granada,
Samuel the Chief (Shmu'el Hannagid, died 1056), who was also one
of the greatest Hebrew poets of all ages, was based primarily
on the fact that the kingdom which he served was a tyranny of
a rather small Berber military force over the Arabic-speaking
inhabitants. A similar situation obtained in the other <i>ta'ifa</i>
Arab-Spanish kingdoms. The position of the Jews declined somewhat
with the establishment of the Almoravid regime (in 1086-90) and
became quite precarious under the strong and popular Almohad regime
(after 1147) when, as a result of persecutions, the Jews migrated
to the Christian Spanish kingdoms, where the power of the kings
was still very slight.</p>

<p><b><u>Christian Spain</u></b><br>
I have left to the last a discussion of the two countries where
the position of the Jewish community and the internal development
of classical Judaism were most important - Christian Spain (or
rather the Iberian peninsula including Portugal) and pre-1795
Poland.</p>

<p>Politically, the position of Jews in the Christian Spanish
kingdoms was the highest ever attained by Jews in any country
(except some of the <i>ta'ifas</i> and under the Fatimids) before
the l9th century. Many Jews served officially as Treasurers General
to the kings of Castile, regional and general tax collectors,
diplomats (representing their king in foreign courts, both Muslim
and Christian, even outside Spain), courtiers and advisers to
rulers and great noblemen. And in no other country except Poland
did the Jewish community wield such great legal powers over the
Jews or used them so widely ant publicly, including the power
to inflict capital punishment. From the I1th century, the persecution
of Karaites (a heretical Jewish sect) by flogging them to death
if unrepentant was common in Castile. Jewish women who cohabited
with Gentiles had their noses cut off by rabbis who explained
that 'in this way she will lose her beauty and her non-Jewish
lover will come to hate her'. Jews who had the effrontery to attack
a rabbinical judge had their hands cut off. Adulterers were imprisoned,
after being made to run the gauntlet through the Jewish quarter.
In religious disputes, those thought to be heretics had their
tongues cut out.</p>

<p>Historically, all this was associated with feudal anarchy and
with the attempt of a few 'strong' kings to rule through sheer
force, disregarding the parliamentary institutions, the Cortes,
which had already come into existence. In this struggle, not only
the political and financial power of the Jews but also their military
power (at least in the most important kingdom, Castile) was very
significant. One example will suffice: both feudal misgovernment
and Jewish political influence in Castile reached their peak under
Pedro I, justly nicknamed the Cruel. The Jewish communities of
Toledo, Burgos and many other cities served practically as his
garrisons in the long civil war between him and his half-brother,
Henry of Trastamara, who after his victory became Henry II (1369-79).
The same Pedro I gave the Jews of Castile the right to establish
a countrywide inquisition against Jewish religious deviants- more
than one hundred years before the establishment of the more famous
Catholic Holy Inquisition.</p>

<p>As in other western European countries, the gradual emergence
of national consciousness around the monarchy, which began under
the house of Trastamara and after ups and downs reached a culmination
under the Catholic kings Ferdinand and Isabella, was accompanied
first by a decline in the position of the Jews, then by popular
movements and pressures against them and finally by their expulsion.
On the whole, the Jews were defended by the nobility and upper
clergy. It was the more plebeian sections of the church, particularly
the mendicant orders, involved in the life of the lower classes,
which were hostile to them. The great enemies of the Jews, Torquemada
and Cardinal Ximenes, were also great reformers of the Spanish
church, making it much less corrupt and much more dependent on
the monarchy instead of being the preserve of the feudal aristocracy.</p>

<p><b><u>Poland</u></b><br>
The old pre-1795 Poland- a feudal republic with an elective king-
is a converse example; it illustrates how before the advent of
the modern state the position of the Jews was socially most important,
and their internal autonomy greatest, under a regime which was
completely retarded to the point of utter degeneracy.</p>

<p>Due to many causes, medieval Poland lagged in its development
behind countries like England and France; a strong feudal-type
monarchy - yet without any parliamentary institutions- was formed
there only in the 14th century, especially under Casimir the Great
(1333-70). Immediately after his death, changes of dynasty and
other factors led to a very rapid development of the power of
the noble magnates, then also of the petty nobility, so that by
1572 the process of reduction of the king to a figure head and
exclusion of all other non-noble estates from political power
was virtually complete. In the following two hundred years, the
lack of government turned into an acknowledged anarchy, to the
point where a court decision in a case affecting a nobleman was
only a legal licence to wage a private war to enforce the verdict
(for there was no other way to enforce it) and where feuds between
great noble houses in the 18th century involved private armies
numbering tens of thousands, much larger than the derisory forces
of the official army of the Republic.</p>

<p>This process was accompanied by a debasement in the position
of the Polish peasants (who had been free in the early Middle
Ages) to the point of utter serfdom, hardly distinguishable from
outright slavery and certainly the worst in Europe. The desire
of noblemen in neighbouring countries to enjoy the power of the
Polish pan over his peasants (including the power of life and
death without any right of appeal) was instrumental in the territorial
expansion of Poland. The situation in the 'eastern' lands of Poland
(Byelorussia and the Ukraine)- colonised and settled by newly
enserfed peasants - was worst of all.</p>

<p>A small number of Jews (albeit in important positions) had
apparently been living in Poland since the creation of the Polish
state. A significant Jewish immigration into that country began
in the 13th century and increased under Casimir the Great, with
the decline in the Jewish position in western and then in central
Europe. Not very much is known about Polish Jewry in that period.
But with the decline of the monarchy in the 16th century- particularly
under Sigismund I the Old (1506-48) and his son Sigismund II Augustus
(1548-72) Polish Jewry burst into social and political prominence
accompanied, as usual, with a much greater degree of autonomy.
It was at this time that Poland's Jews were granted their greatest
privileges, culminating in the establishment of the famous Committee
of Four Lands, a very effective autonomous Jewish organ of rule
and jurisdiction over all the Jews in Poland's four divisions.
One of its many important functions was to collect all the taxes
from Jews all over the country, deducting part of the yield for
its own use and for the use of local Jewish communities, and passing
the rest on to the state treasury.</p>

<p>What was the social role of Polish Jewry from the beginning
of the 16th century until 1795? With the decline of royal power
, the king's usual role in relation to the Jews was rapidly taken
over by the nobility- with lasting and tragic results both for
the Jews themselves and for the common people of the Polish republic.
All over Poland, the nobles used Jews as their agents to undermine
the commercial power of the Royal Towns, which were weak in any
case. Alone among the countries of western Christendom, in Poland
a nobleman's property inside a Royal Town was exempt from the
town's laws and guild regulations. In most cases, the nobles settled
their Jewish clients in such properties, thus giving rise to a
lasting conflict. The Jews were usually 'victorious', in the sense
that the towns could neither subjugate nor drive them off; but
in the frequent popular riots Jewish lives (and, even more, Jewish
property) were lost. The nobles still got the profits. Similar
or worse consequences followed from the frequent use of Jews as
commercial agents of noblemen: they won exemption from most Polish
tolls and tariffs, to the loss of the native bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>But the most lasting and tragic results occurred in the eastern
provinces of Poland- roughly, the area east of the present border,
including almost the whole of the present Ukraine and reaching
up to the Great-Russian language frontier. (Until 1667 the Polish
border was far east of the Dnieper, so that Poltava, for example,
was inside Poland.) In those wide territories, there were hardly
any Royal Towns. The towns were established by nobles and belonged
to them - and they were settled almost exclusively by Jews. Until
1939, the population of many Polish towns east of the river Bug
was at least 90 per cent Jewish, and this demographic phenomenon
was even more pronounced in that area of Tsarist Russia annexed
from Poland and known as the Jewish Pale. Outside the towns very
many Jews throughout Poland, but especially in the east, were
employed as the direct supervisors and oppressors of the enserfed
peasantry - as bailiffs of whole manors (invested with the landlord's
full coercive powers) or as lessees of particular feudal monopolies
such as the corn mill, the liquor still and public house (with
the right of armed search of peasant houses for illicit stills)
or the bakery, and as collectors of customary feudal dues of all
kinds. In short, in eastern Poland, under the rule of the nobles
(and of the feudalised church, formed exclusively from the nobility)
the Jews were both the <i>immediate exploiters of the peasantry
</i>and virtually the only town-dwellers.</p>

<p>No doubt, most of the profit they extracted from the peasants
was passed on to the landlords, in one way or another. No doubt,
the oppression and subjugation of the Jews by the nobles were
severe, and the historical record tells many a harrowing tale
of the hardship and humiliation inflicted by noblemen on 'their'
Jews. But, as we have remarked, the peasants suffered worse oppression
at the hands of both landlords and Jews; and one may assume that,
except in times of peasant uprisings, the full weight of the Jewish
religious laws against Gentiles fell upon the peasants. As will
be seen in the next chapter, these laws are suspended or mitigated
in cases where it is feared that they might arouse dangerous hostility
towards Jews; but the hostility of the peasants could be disregarded
as ineffectual so long as the Jewish bailiff could shelter under
the 'peace' of a great lord.<br>
The situation stagnated until the advent of the modern state,
by which time Poland had been dismembered. Therefore, Poland was
the only big country in western Christendom from which the Jews
were never expelled. A new middle class could not arise out of
the utterly enslaved peasantry; and the old bourgeoisie was geographically
limited and commercially weak, and therefore powerless. Overall,
matters got steadily worse, but without any substantial change.</p>

<p>Internal conditions within the Jewish community moved in a
similar course. In the period 1500-1795, one of the most superstition-ridden
in the history of Judaism, Polish Jewry was the most superstitious
and fanatic of all Jewish communities. The considerable power
of the Jewish autonomy was used increasingly to stifle all original
or innovative thought, to promote the most shameless exploitation
of the Jewish poor by the Jewish rich in alliance with the rabbis,
and to justify the Jews' role in the oppression of the peasants
in the service of the nobles. Here, too, there was no way out
except by liberation from outside. Pre-1795 Poland, where the
<i>social</i> role of the Jews was more important than in any
other classical diaspora, illustrates better than any other country
the bankruptcy of classical Judaism.</p>

<h3><center>CHRISTMAS 1998</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By E. Yaghi</i></b></center></p>

<p>You know, I've never celebrated Christmas before though I've
always wondered exactly what it's like. I've seen Christmas trees
with bright colored lights blink on and off and curl around pine
branches. I love to see silver, gold, green and red balls twirl
and multi-colored tinsel wrap itself in a magical world of seeming
love and peace. And oh, what lies hidden under the tree? I've
never really had a present before. It must be simply great to
wake up on Christmas morning while everyone else is still sleeping
and tiptoe up to that majestic glowing tree and shake a shiny
wrapped gift trying to guess what's inside.</p>

<p>I've seen shows about Christmas. Safe homes where children
have the luxury of warmth in the winter, shelter and a turkey
on the table on Christmas day. Well, I'll soon tell you what happened
to me this month of December, but it wasn't really like I dreamed.</p>

<p>My father was a street cleaner in the occupied city of Jerusalem.
I am one of eight children. My name is Ahmed and I am 11 years
old. My family and I are Palestinians. My forefathers have lived
in Jerusalem for nearly two thousand years. Not too far from where
I live is the Haram Square where you can see both mosques of the
Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa. My father used to pray in both mosques
and when I was old enough, took me with him to pray too.</p>

<p>I loved my father dearly. I am the third oldest child of my
siblings and the oldest boy. The other day, tragedy struck my
family. I heard yells not too far from my simple home where I
live. My father used to say that there is no harm in being poor
as long as one has honor and integrity. He tried to teach me love
for others and to avoid hanging around with anyone who was not
ethical. He worked hard to put food on the table and taught us
to always be appreciative of what little we had. But when I heard
the yells, I ran out the door of my one story home and pushed
my way through a crowd of people only to see my father lying on
the ground bleeding profusely. I ran up to him screaming, &quot;Father,
father, what happened to you?&quot;</p>

<p>Some strong hands pulled me away and a voice very solemn and
heavy said, &quot;Stay away lad. We have sent for an ambulance.
Your father needs help as soon as possible or he won't make it.&quot;</p>

<p>Again I screamed, saying, &quot;No, no! Please dear God, it's
not possible. My father never hurt anybody. He was just a street
cleaner!&quot;</p>

<p>No ambulance came and my father's blood coated the sidewalk
where he lay, life pumping out of his veins. He was in a state
of shock and gave no visible signs of being aware what was going
on around him. I wormed my way back and threw myself next to him
sobbing, crying out his name, begging him not to die. But Death
does not hear anyone's pleas and my father was not able to delay
his rendezvous for one second past its deadline.</p>

<p>Through my tears I heard a voice from the gathering crowd say,
&quot;Who could have done such a thing?&quot;<br>
Another voice answered, &quot;I saw a Jewish settler stab him
repeatedly and then run away.&quot;</p>

<p>I watched my father bleed to death before an ambulance finally
arrived. It is the belief of the onlookers that the Israelis delayed
sending an ambulance on purpose as they so often do, so that victims
of Israeli atrocities would die before help arrived. Such was
the case with my father. An ambulance paramedic threw a sheet
over my father and his stiff and lifeless form was carted away
as I stayed frozen to the spot, looking at his blood that still
thickened on the cold sidewalk. Cameramen appeared and filmed
footage of my father's blood and where he had lain only moments
before. Then they accompanied me to my family's simple home where
more footage was taken of my mother, now crying and saying, &quot;Why
was he killed? My husband never hurt anyone in his life! Why was
he taken from us? How shall we manage now that he is gone?&quot;</p>

<p>I try to rectify in my mind what has happened. I search for
the Christmas star at night over the little town of Bethlehem
and I think of children my age, warm around their Christmas trees
with an abundance of presents at their feet, and envy them, not
their trees, nor their presents anymore but the peace they have,
and the gift they have of fathers.</p>

<p>My father is dead. No Christmas carols for me. No Christmas
cheer for me. And now to share my misery are Iraqi children who
will lose perhaps their fathers too and maybe their own lives
because of massive American led air strikes against Iraq.</p>

<p>I wonder where is the peace on earth and good will to men during
this holy time. This year, Ramadan will be very bleak for myself
and my younger brothers and sisters. Though some Israeli officials
came to our house and gave their condolences, I am not impressed.
I just want my father back. I don't want their hollow sympathy
for I know that if they had their way, no Palestinian children
would have fathers or grow up to become ones themselves.</p>

<h3><center>RAMADAN</center></h3>

<p><center><b><i>By Ruth Anderson</i></b></center></p>

<p>As a convert to Islam and as a person who has lived in the
Middle East for a number of years, Ramadan has always been a special
time of year for me and my family. It is a time of spiritual growth
and a confirmation of religious faith. It is a time when the hungers
and passions of the physical give way to spiritual devotion and
reinforce religious conviction.</p>

<p>Ramadan is not the only time of year one must remember the
poor and less fortunate, but it is a time when the pangs of hunger
rock a person's being, that one is more conscience of those who
lack basic necessities and the luxury of food on the table.</p>

<p>What the prayers offered five times a day do, i.e. strengthens
faith, paves the way for obedience to God and life of virtue,
refreshes belief, purity of heart, advancement of the soul and
enrichment of morals, fasting in Ramadan does for a whole month.
A fasting person does not eat nor drink from dawn to dusk regardless
of how hungry or thirsty that person may be or how inviting the
food may seem. The spirit of patience increased by incessant fasting
for one full month strengthens faith and the rigor and discipline
of the fast itself bring us face to face with the realities of
life and helps make our lives for the rest of the year in submission
to God's will.</p>

<p>Fasting has an immense impact on society, for all Muslims,
irrespective of their social or financial status must observe
the fast during the same month and in the same time zones, break
the fast in unison to the call of the evening prayer. In Ramadan,
we are reminded of the essential equality of us all and this goes
a long way towards creating in us sentiments of love and brotherhood.
During Ramadan, evil conceals itself while good becomes prominent
and the atmosphere of each house of the faithful is filled with
piety and purity.</p>

<p>Of course, fasting (Sawm) is a form of worship and also the
fourth pillar of Islam, along with the Shahadah (Declaration of
Faith), Salah (prayers), Zakah (giving alms), and Hajj (the pilgrimage
to Mecca). Fasting develops self-control and should help those
who fast to overcome their selfish inclinations, greed and other
faults.</p>

<p>The month of Ramadan is a month of forgiveness, mercy and a
way of avoiding the punishment of Hell. A Muslim is to avoid bad
actions during his fast. He should not tell a lie, break a promise
or commit any deceitful act. The purpose of fasting is to help
a Muslim control his passions so that he becomes a person of good
deeds and intentions. Fasting also controls anger, which is a
common human weakness.</p>

<p>Fasting is the one faithful act that Muslims do for God. All
other acts are done for ourselves, such as praying. We pray to
God, not because He needs our prayers, but because praying enhances
our faith and gives us discipline. But we fast out of our love
for God. There is a special gate in Heaven called Al Rayan. On
the Day of Resurrection, those pious who fasted will enter this
gate.</p>

<p>My fasting will be mixed with family duties and obligations,
but it is my hope that I do not lose sight of the spiritual meaning
of Ramadan. It is my greatest hope too, that the spirit of Ramadan
reaches out and touches Arab and Muslim leaders and that they
reassess their moral and political goals at a time when the Iraqi
people are suffering more than ever before after the American
led air strikes against them.</p>

<p>May you all have an enriched and pleasant Ramadan and may you
have a warm and beautiful Eid and may all of you who are sincere
and who observe the month of Ramadan enter Heaven through Al Rayan.</p>
