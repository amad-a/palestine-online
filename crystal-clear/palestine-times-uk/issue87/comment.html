<H3><CENTER>Time To Challenge American Hegemony</CENTER></H3>

<P>So, the Great Satan, the perfect label the late Imam Khumeini attached
to the United States, did it again, this time against two impoverished Muslim
countries, Sudan and Afghanistan. <BR>
The declared justification for this cowboy-minded aggression was &quot;to
hit terrorism&quot;, especially in the aftermath of the bombing of the two
American embassies in Nairobi and Dar el Salaam. <BR>
However, the more likely motive for the bombing of the two Muslim countries
was Bill Clinton's apparent desire to divert attention from his domestic
troubles, mainly his adulterous relationship with former White House intern,
Monica Lewinsky.<BR>
Never the less, this shouldn't alone account for American savagery against
Muslims. <BR>
To begin with, there is absolutely no evidence linking Sudan, especially
the bombed-out pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, to any form of &quot;terrorism&quot;
or alleged production of chemical weapons. <BR>
Indeed, why would the Government of Sudan so openly and so earnestly invite
the UN or other international bodies to inspect the bombed-out site if it
ever had anything to hide? In fact, it is the American Government that is
resisting inspection of the site by an impartial international body, which
could only mean that the Americans want to avoid appearing as naked liars
in the full view of the world. <BR>
Never the less, it would be naive to think the Americans, with all their
intelligence-gathering abilities, didn't know that. They surely did, but
decided to go ahead and hit Sudan anyway. Why is that?<BR>
The reason is amply clear. The Zionist-dominated Clinton Administration
despises all Muslims, Governments and individuals, who take their faith
seriously, e.g. by refusing to be subservient to American hegemony. <BR>
Indeed, this is first and foremost the reason behind American enmity and
vitriolic hostility towards countries such as Sudan and the Islamic Republic
of Iran. It is also the same morbid perception that prompted the American
Congress to dispatch two congressmen to Indonesia recently to warn President
Habibi against &quot;slackening restrictions on Islamists lest democracy
be undermined.&quot;<BR>
What democracy? We all know too well in this part of the world that the
United States, through its successive administrations-republican and democrat-has
been impeding democratization in the Arab world in favour of despotic and
autocratic regimes that trample on their peoples' will.<BR>
This shameful policy apparently stems from the premise that if Arab-Muslim
masses were allowed to choose their leaders in fair and democratic elections,
a new breed of leaders would come to power who would be more responsible
to their people than they are to the White House, which means that American
economic and strategic interests in the region would be endangered.<BR>
So despotism in the Arab world and cheap oil for America go hand-in-hand.
In other words, if you want to have cheap oil, you shouldn't think about
democracy, and sustaining despotism in the Arab world is the only way through
which American interests are safeguarded.<BR>
Obviously, this is nothing but evil-incarnate. Protecting, sustaining and
seeking to perpetuate despotism in the Arab world (despotism is essentially
incompatible with the principles America claims to adhere to), along with
the blind and scandalous American support for Jewish colonization of Palestine
and torment of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, is and will continue
to be translated into &quot;terrorism&quot; against American targets around
the world.<BR>
This is not something good or bad. It is inevitable, given American morbid
determination to ignore the collective feelings of hundred of millions of
Muslims around the world who have come to believe that the United States
is truly evil and truly satanic, if only because it supports and protects
evil and satanic regimes in many Muslim countries.<BR>
None the less, one should probably not think that Muslims and Americans
are to be doomed to endless confrontations of violence-breeding violence.
However, in order for the United States to revert to its senses, Muslims
(especially the masses since the regimes are hopelessly dead) must put up
fierce resistance to American aggression and hegemony. <BR>
America must understand, or be made to understand, that Muslim rights, dignity
and freedom are not expendable. America must change its scandalous approach
to the two main subjects of concern to Muslims: the Palestinian issue and
democracy in the Arab world. <BR>
This should mean that continued American support for Israeli territorial
aggrandizement and colonization at the Palestinians' expense and continued
American backing of the impotent but despotic regimes in the Arab world
will continue to backfire.</P>
