<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Netanyahu displays more extremism ahead of
elections</font></font mstheme></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel escalated its sabre-rattling against the Palestinian Authority this
week after PA President Yasser Arafat threatened to resume the intifadah, or popular
uprising, if the Jewish State sought to deprive the Palestinian people of their right to
self-determination and Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials, from Prime Minister Benyamin Netanayhu down the line,
issued a plethora of statements warning the PA against &#147;misreading Israel&#146;s
resolve&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 20 March, a statement came out of Netanyahu&#146;s office warning
Palestinians that Israel would take &#147;strong and swift action&#148; in case the PA
unilaterally declared Palestinian Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement did not explain what &#147;strong and swift action&#148;
would entail, but the Israeli Hebrew daily, <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i>, pointed out in its 21
March edition that Israel would annex the vast bulk of the West Bank in the case of a
formal Statehood declaration by Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to preparing to annex 70% of the West Bank, Israel is also
preparing contingency plans to over-run the seven Palestinian towns currently under PA
administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Israeli press, the two plans, code named &#147;Operation
Thorn Field&#148; and &#147;Musical Fascination&#148;, involve stationing snipers at
rooftops of high buildings, as well as deploying special forces inside the towns in
addition to using helicopter gunships to quell violent protests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The renewed Israeli warnings surrounding the subject of Palestinian
Statehood came a few days after the latest row between Israel and the European Union over
the status of Jerusalem, following the recent EU acknowledgement that the whole of
Jerusalem was, as far as Europe is concerned, a <i>corpus separatum</i> or &#147;a
separate body&#148; belonging to neither Israel nor the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Netanyahu, appearing inclined to make the subject of Jerusalem the main
issue in the Israeli election campaign, attacked the EU &#147;for daring to interfere in
Israeli internal affairs.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Israel&#148;, he said, &#147;will never allow any country or group
of countries to dictate the boundaries of our capital.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Utterly ignoring the fact that Arab East Jerusalem was occupied by Israeli
troops in 1967, as was the rest of the West Bank, Netanyahu suggested that Jerusalem was
not subject to negotiation with the Palestinians or anybody else.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I believe the final status talks on Jerusalem would be very brief,
because there will be nothing to talk about as far as we are concerned&#148;, said
Netanyahu in a Jerusalem press conference on 18 March.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the Israeli elections only 55 days away, it is clear that Netanyahu
wants to exploit the general Israeli Jewish consensus on the town to bolster his election
prospects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this context, Netanyahu reacted nervously to a visit to the Orient
House (formerly the headquarters of the Palestinian Delegation to the Madrid Peace
Conference) on 19 March by some ten Western diplomats who were received by three PA
officials&#151;Faisal Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and Ziad Abu Ziad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Netanyahu, who earlier had sought to prevent the convening of the meeting
through his Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, responded to &#147;the provocation&#148; by
stripping the three PA officials of their VIP status.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This implied that the three Jerusalemites would be frisked and humiliated
by Israeli soldiers manning roadblocks and checkpoints at key intersections throughout the
West Bank and between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, just like the rest of the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Husseini described the Israeli reaction to the meeting as
&#147;provocative and probably meant to serve the election considerations of
Netanyahu.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ashrawi labelled it a sign of &#147;political bankruptcy&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The draconian measure taken against the three Palestinian leaders is
consistent with Netanyahu&#146;s express policy of &#147;lowering Palestinian
expectations&#148; regarding Jerusalem and the rest of the Palestinian territories
occupied by Israel in 1967.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From Netanyahu&#146;s viewpoint, lowering Palestinian expectations clearly
implies Palestinian acceptance of the fact of Israeli occupation of at least 50% of the
West Bank and 30% of the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It also implies that Palestinians, particularly the Palestinian Authority,
will come to terms with Jerusalem as &#147;Israel&#146;s eternal and united capital&#148;
as well as the &#147;indelible&#148; 206 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, Netanyahu expects nothing short of capitulation from the
Palestinian Authority, and his way of doing that is first by insisting on his stance and
resisting international, especially American, pressure.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Postponement of declaration</b></i><br>
Meanwhile, Arafat seems to have taken a decision to postpone the declaration of
Palestinian Statehood until at least after the Israeli elections. It is not clear yet if
the postponement will be open-ended, as the Americans seem to insist, or for a limited
period of time, as the Palestinian public opinion demands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That postponement decision was actually widely expected, given the
American opposition to the unilateral declaration of Palestinian Statehood. The American
administration reportedly made clear to Arafat that &#147;unilateral actions&#148; were
unacceptable whether taken by Israel or the Palestinians. However, it is all too clear
that when applied to the Palestinians, &#147;unacceptable&#148; means &#147;active
opposition&#148; whereas it means &#147;passive opposition&#148; when applied to Israel,
e.g. the expansion of Jewish settlements and the unilateral Israeli suspension of the Wye
River memorandum.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the Palestinian leader had been hoping, to no avail, that
the United States would reward or at least compensate him for taking such a difficult
decision, which is quite unpopular among Palestinians who had been made to believe that
the fourth of May was a watershed signifying Palestinian Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, Arafat, along with many others in the Middle East, must wait to see
the outcome of the Israeli elections before taking his next step. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Palestinians: UN report on human rights<br>
doesn&#146;t tell the whole story</font></b></font mstheme></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Human rights observers in the Occupied territories criticized a recent UN
report on human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for &#147;understating
the severity of human rights violations by both Israel and the Palestinian
Authority.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report, prepared by UN investigator Hannu Halinen of Finland and
published in early March, claimed that Israel had discontinued the most flagrant torture
methods, but failed to specify which methods were actually discontinued and when.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report argued that &#147;while there is a positive development to be
recognized on the Israeli side&#151;such as the decrease in administrative detention and
the discontinuation of &#145;the most flagrant torture methods&#146;&#151;it appears that
such violations are increasing on the Palestinian side.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report did mention, though, that Israel was continuing to use a wide
range of physical and psychological methods of torture against Palestinian detainees as
well as depriving Palestinians as a whole of their economic and other basic human rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Halinen didn&#146;t say what made him conclude that there had been a
certain mitigation in the severity of torture methods used by Israeli interrogators, nor
did he explain the reasons for &#147;reduced administrative detention&#148;, namely the
fact that fewer Palestinians are now living under Israel&#146;s direct military rule.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it seems amply clear that what he had in mind is a set of petty
&#147;improvements&#148;, which Israel reportedly introduced as part of its torture
methods of late.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These included the substitution of the filthy-smelling sack placed on
detainees&#146; heads for prolonged periods of time by another less rancid one, and also
the substitution of hard-pressed metal handcuffs by others made of rubber.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basem Eid, Director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group,
described Halinen&#146;s report as &#147;understating the truth about human rights
violations by Israel and the Palestinian Authority.&#148; Eid said that while the report
certainly contained useful information, it didn&#146;t reflect the depth and extent of the
human rights tragedy in the occupied territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;He (Halinen) didn&#146;t produce any evidence supporting his claim
that the brutality of torture by Israeli interrogators against Palestinian detainees had
been reduced or mitigated in any significant manner.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eid argued that Halinen failed to ascertain the veracity of the
&#147;vague Israeli claims&#148; that some of their most sinister and flagrant torture
methods were no longer used by Shabak interrogators.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Eid questioned whether the present data concerning the use of
torture by Israeli interrogators justify Halinen&#146;s conclusion that &#147;there is an
improvement on the Israeli side.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There is a blackout on what is going on inside the interrogation
chambers, and no serious human rights investigator can or should take statements to that
effect by torturers or their bosses at their face value.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eid pointed out that there was no evidence suggesting that the use of the
notorious &#147;shaking technique&#148; (which killed at least one Palestinian detainee,
Abdul Samad Hureizat) was discontinued.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eid&#146;s assertions are in fact corroborated, even vindicated, by the
report itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, far from presenting credible evidence supporting his conclusion
that there has been &#147;a positive development to be recognized on Israel&#146;s
side&#148;, Halinen did in fact cite another little-known but no less sinister torture
method employed by Israeli interrogators.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That method, he explains, involves the cutting off of a detainee&#146;s
blood circulation by placing him in extremely tight handcuffs whereby the resulting strong
pressure on the upper arm causes the person to lose consciousness in approximately three
minutes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The use of this method, which reportedly is becoming widespread, can
hardly be considered an improvement, particularly when viewed in the context of the other
&#147;traditional&#148; forms of torture that are sanctioned by the Israeli High Court.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These forms include, <i>inter alia</i>, moderate beating (the task of
defining what is moderate is left to the interrogator&#146;s own discretion), the
above-mentioned hooding, sleep deprivation, handcuffing, blindfolding, fettering,
confining detainees in agonizing positions for many hours, placing opaque dark glasses on
detainees&#146; eyes (which could inflict irreparable damage to their eyesight) and the
shaking technique. Added to that is a variety of psychological forms of torture, including
sexual humiliation, all designed to demoralize detainees and break their will to resist.
Unfortunately, the UN report didn&#146;t sufficiently underscore the nightmarish nature of
these torture methods and the flagrant human rights violations inherent in employing them
on Palestinian detainees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel considers the use of &#147;moderate physical pressure&#148; against
Palestinian detainees an indispensable method in combating Palestinian, especially
Islamist, resistance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is sufficiently clear from victims&#146; testimonies that
Israeli interrogators use torture as the &#147;norm&#148; rather than the
&#147;exception&#148; to punish Palestinians for their ideas, mainly their ideological
orientation and affiliation with certain organizations, e.g. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.
Last year, the Israeli lawyer Lea Tsemel, who has defended Palestinians before Israeli
courts since 1967, testified that the employment of torture by Israeli interrogators was a
routine practice that is aimed first and foremost at punishing Palestinian detainees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government and its Shin Beth interrogators (Shin Beth is the
main torture agency in Israel) remain unmoved by local and international protests against
the legalization, let alone the use of torture against Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 2 March, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled in favour of keeping
the torture methods employed by the Shin Beth secret, a very telling step about the
complementary relation between Israel&#146;s judicial system and its security apparatus.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">UN report ignored by Israeli authorities</b><br>
&#147;The UN report on human rights violations in the occupied territories&#148;, as it is
officially termed, was generally ignored by the Israeli authorities. David Bar Illan, head
of the political planning department at the Israeli Prime Minister&#146;s office,
criticized the report for &#147;failing to take Israeli security needs into account.&#148;
He indicated that Israel was trying to minimize the use of torture, a claim which, as we
saw, doesn&#146;t seem to be genuine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likewise, the PA said nothing about what the report described as &#147;the
increasing violation of human rights and civil liberties by PA security
organizations.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One official at the PA Ministry of Justice said, &#147;We aren&#146;t
allowed to comment on these matters.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Normally, when PA officials are confronted with human rights violations
within the autonomous enclaves, they retort with a shrug saying &#147;we are not living in
Sweden or Denmark.&#148;</p>

Of Palestinian Dissatisfaction</font></b></font mstheme></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the most violent protests ever against Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat&#146;s self-rule government broke out on March 10 after a local Palestinian
man from Rafah, south Gaza, was condemned to death for slaying a policeman from the
Palestine Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hundreds of demonstrators rioted in the Yabna refugee camp after a
security court in Gaza City condemned a local resident, from a prominent Rafah family;
Ra&#146;d al Attar, to death for the February 1 killing of a policeman in Rafah. Attar,
25, a member of a PA security force, was accused of acting as a double agent for the
Islamic group Hamas. An associate of Attar, Mohammed Abu Shamallah also 25, was sentenced
to life in prison and a third man, Osama Abu Tahar, 24, was jailed for 15 years hard labor
for involvement in the shooting. This has been the first time that the PA has handed down
the death sentence against a suspected member of Hamas. <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(-1,2) (306,24) {Relatives of the convicted protest in Rafah } {Times New Roman} 10 B #ff0000 CT 0  " src="attar-protest.gif" alt="attar-protest.jpg (25846 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" u-originalsrc="attar-protest.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/news.html_txt_attar-protest.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the camp of Yabna, PA police opened fire when hundreds of protesters
threw stones at them and blocked roads with burning tires to protest the sentences. PA
police killed two teenagers, Ala&#146; Al Hams and Khamis Mahmoud Salama, both 17. Three
other persons were also wounded, one a 10-year-old boy. Police quickly withdrew from the
camp streets after the shooting.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later, during a 1000 strong funeral procession for Ala&#146; Al Hams,
people stoned local police stations when the cortege passed by, which in turn prompted
officers inside to fire in the air. Further unrest followed after the burial. News of the
rioting let President Arafat cut short a scheduled visit to Amman, Jordan. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attar, Abu Shamala and Abut Taha were charged with killing PA captain
Rifa&#146;at Joudeh after he tried to get the three men to surrender to him. The three men
tried to flee and in their escape attempt, they also hit and killed two children, one of
whom was a 6-year-old girl, with their speeding car.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to PA sources, Attar, Abu Shamallah and Abu Tahar were
recruited into the PA police force three years ago after declaring they had quit the armed
wing of Hamas, Izzedin Al Qassam. Prosecutors accused the three of secretly continuing to
work for Hamas and when they were discovered and agents moved in to arrest them in Rafah
on February 1, they shot and killed a captain in the Palestinian internal security
service, Rif&#146;at Judeh. However, Hamas officials stated that the three men had quit
Hamas and that the shootout that occurred was the result of a dispute between rival
branches of the Palestinian security apparatus.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequently, President Arafat ordered a review of the death sentence
against Attar. Mahmoud Hussein, Secretary of Arafat&#146;s Fateh movement in Gaza Strip,
told reporters that, &#147;President Arafat met the killer&#146;s family and granted their
wish to review the death sentence handed down to Ra&#146;d Al Attar and the sentences
given by the court to his two accomplices.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arafat&#146;s decision to review the sentence against Attar brought
calm to the streets of Rafah on March 13 and shops and schools reopened and residents went
about their business as normal witnesses stated. In a further attempt to ease tension,
Arafat promised the families of the two 17-year-olds slain when PA police opened fire on
the stone-throwing protesters, that the circumstances surrounding the killings would be
investigated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The passing of the death sentence and the subsequent rioting have
intensified the growing and even sometimes violent rift between supporters and opponents
of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and the peace process itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, a Palestinian human rights group operating in the Palestinian
autonomous enclaves criticized the death sentence which a PA Gaza court passed earlier on
an erstwhile Hamas member, Ra&#146;ed Attar, on suspicion of killing a PA security officer
in Khan Younis last month.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basem Eid, Director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group,
described the court verdict as &#147;unjust and unlawful&#148;, saying the trial of the
defendants in the Judeh&#146;s case lacked the internationally observed procedures.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eid said the court failed to establish beyond any doubt that the
Preventive Security Force officer, Judeh, was killed by Attar.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eid accused the PA courts of &#147;issuing sentences under street
pressure&#148;, saying that &#147;this is not justice; it is vengeance.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eid argued that the trial of the three suspects in the killing of Judeh
should have involved more investigation and forensic testing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, PA courts have passed 27seven death sentences; 5 of them were
actually carried out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Tuesday, 16 March, a high-ranking PA official quoted Yasser Arafat as
saying, &#147;We can&#146;t establish the authority of law because we don&#146;t have the
money to employ competent judges.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>&#150; <b>Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hundreds of Fatah supporters demonstrated in Ramallah on 16 March, to
protest PA failure to bring to justice the murderer of Wisam al-Tarifi, who was killed by
a stray bullet during inter-Fatah disturbances in Ramallah last year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The demonstrators shouted slogans against Musa Arafat, who reportedly gave
orders to open fire on a peaceful march of Fatah activists, resulting in the death of
Tarifi.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The protesters called on Arafat to see to it that the authority of law is
respected.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They vowed to &#147;take the law into their own hands&#148; if the PA
failed to punish the murderer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, Tarifi&#146;s father criticized the court where two suspects
were being tried, calling it &#147;a court of injustice.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is the third time in two weeks Fatah activists have taken to the
streets to demonstrate against the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, supporters of Preventive Security Chief Jebril Rajoub
demonstrated in East Jerusalem against Tawfik Tirawi, head of the PA General Intelligence
Force. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least three Palestinian citizens in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were
killed in March in shooting incidents involving Palestinian Authority policemen.<br>
On 22 March, one Palestinian, a Fatah activist from Ramallah, was killed when a random
bullet, apparently fired by Fatah supporters who were celebrating a certain anniversary,
hit him in the head.<br>
Two persons in Gaza also died earlier last month, one of them a policeman, as a result of
the &quot;misuse of firearms&quot; by policemen.<br>
The Palestinian human rights organization, al Qanun, or the &quot;law&#148; denounced
&quot;the wide misuse of firearms by PA policemen&quot; and &quot;the use of firearms by
security cadres in during squabbles and quarrels.&quot;<br>
Al Qanun pointed out that five Palestinians were killed in the last five months in
shooting incidents.<br>
The PA issued regulations banning the use of firearms in public, but police largely failed
to enforce the law mainly because there are as many as ten independent security agencies
operating in the Palestinian autonomous enclaves with little or no coordination among
themselves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In another development, four Palestinian Legislative Council members
participating in a symposium on &#147;Democracy in Palestine&#148; in Jenin on 17 March,
unanimously agreed that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat was the chief factor
impeding the development of democracy in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The four councilors, Ahmed Irsheid, Burhan Jarrar, Fakhri Turkuman and
Jamal Shati, pointed out that Arafat very often neither respects nor carries out the
decisions of the Legislative Council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They pointed out that Arafat&#146;s political thinking is incompatible
with such democratic principles as civil society, constitutional rights and separation of
powers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shati pointed out that there was only one way out of the
&#147;impasse&#148; facing our country, namely the recognition by the executive authority,
e.g. Arafat, that it is not above the law, and that its powers are not absolute.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shati accused Arafat of &#147;making concerted efforts to sideline the
Legislative Council.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These attempts, he said, were taking many forms, including disregarding
the Council&#146;s decisions and recommendations, undermining the immunity of the Council,
corroding the independence of the judiciary, and fettering press freedom and expression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shati argued that &#147;what we are ending up with is an autocracy, where
the president takes all the decisions and controls everything.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<font SIZE="4">Arafat gets Netanyahu&#146;s blesses</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu praised the PA for foiling
an alleged military operation by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) against Israeli
targets.<br>
Speaking in a brief press conference following his return from a visit to Russian, the
Ukraine, and Georgia, Netanyahu said &quot;what the PA did was commendable and
admirable.&quot;<br>
However, he demanded that the PA do more in the field of combating Palestinian resistance
against Zionist occupiers.<br>
Moreover, Netanyahu criticized the PA for adopting the &quot;revolving-door policy,&quot;
an allusion to the release from PA jails of a few political detainees who had spent up to
three years in PA custody without charge or trial.<br>
Observers and human rights activists in Palestine believe the PA incarcerate hundreds of
Palestinian activists and opposition supporters for no reason other than pleasing and
appeasing Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<font SIZE="4">Corruption</font></p>

<p>Palestinian jurists criticized the Palestinian leadership last month for
&quot;personalizing the entire Palestinian Authority in the person of Yaser Arafat.&quot;<br>
The jurists, who included law professors and observers monitoring the quality of
governance under the PA regime, pointed out that the concentration of nearly all powers in
the hands of Arafat created a situation where an average Palestinian citizen became unable
to distinguish between Arafat and the Palestinian Authority.<br>
The cited the allocation of financial assistance to Palestinian local councils as a
flagrant example of &quot;the patriarchal system being fostered under the PA .&quot; <br>
They pointed out that all financial allocations paid to local councils, and other
institutions and societies are offered under the title &quot;generous grants from the
President&quot; when in fact they come from the budget of the Palestinian authority.</p>

warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu might order the assassination of a

The sources intimated that Netanyahu was still committed to &quot;liquidating&quot; Khalid

from Hizbulla pertaining to possible assassination by the Mossad.<br>
According to Lebanese sources, several Israeli agents in Hizbullah custody confessed to
having visited Jordan several times using falsified Turkish and Canadian passports for the
purpose of monitoring the movements of Islamist leaders based in Amman. </p>

Two Mossad agents sprayed a poisonous chemical material in Misha&#146;al&#146;s ear. His

Netanyahu to send the anti-poison chemical which was the only way to save Mr.
Misha&#146;al&#146;s life. This and the release of Sheikh Ahmad Yasin, Hamas founder and
spiritual leader were King Hussein&#146;s conditions to release and return the Mossad
agents to Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in
the Hebron region are experiencing what seems to be the severest water shortage crisis
ever.<br>
According to Palestinians sources, the problem is acute in Dura, Yatta, Dahiriya, as well
as in hundreds of villages and hamlets along the former armistice line separating the West
Bank and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948.<br>
The problem, said the sources, is exacerbated even two main factors, first the scarcity of
rainfall this winter which didn't exceed one third of its annual average, and the
arrogation by the Israeli authorities of the virtually all water resources in the West
Bank. <br>
The Palestinian Authority stands almost completely powerless to help the Palestinian
people overcome the problem.<br>
In Dura for example the PA told townspeople it couldn't help them and suggested that they
make arrangements with the Israeli occupation authorities to obtain drinking water.<br>
One official at Dura municipal council commented on this saying &quot;this is the first
time in history a government asks its people to contact a foreign government for essential
services.&quot;<br>
In the meanwhile, water prices have skyrocketed in the black markets in the West Bank.<br>
Palestinian sources said a cubic meter of water is sold in Hebron at $10 US dollars,
probably the highest anywhere in the world.<br>
The water crisis is expected to deteriorate even further in the weeks and months ahead,
especially with the continuation of the drought.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, a study published in Palestine last month revealed that the
Zionist<b> </b>regime arrogates 720 million cubic meters of Jordan River Waters, of which
650 million cubic meters are drinking water.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Zionists get 50 million cubic meters of drinking water
from the lake of Tibariya in northern Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The study, prepared by the two Palestinian geologists Sael Washahi and
Dr. Hisham Oratani, also pointed out that the Zionist completely arrogated the
Palestinians' share of the River Jordan's water since Palestinians are not allowed to
reach the river or the strip of land adjacent to it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still more, the study revealed that the remaining water ending up in
the Dead Sea is contaminated with poisonous industrial wastes, including cancer-causing
chemicals.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The study comes at a time when Palestinians and Jordanians are
embracing for the severest water shortage crisis ever this summer due to the severe
drought that hit much of the Middle East this winter.<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"> </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b></font><font SIZE="4">Worst summer</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The head of the Water Department in the Palestinian Authority, Fadel
Ka&#146;awash, warned recently that Palestinians living under PA rule would experience an
acute water shortage crisis, which he said &#147;will be the severest ever.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;If the Israelis deny us the amounts of water allocated to us in
accordance with the Oslo Accords, many Palestinians will literally go thirsty this
summer&#148;, Ka&#146;awash said in a press interview on 16 March.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ka&#146;awash pointed out that the water situation in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip is already ominous, saying that people in many localities were already
storing water for the summer.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian official said Israel controls over 80% of Palestinian
waters, adding that Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza consume the bulk of these
waters.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He pointed out that while a single Palestinian receives an average of
30 litres of water per day, a Jewish settler receives an average of 800 litres per day.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Oslo Accords, Israel is supposed to give the
Palestinians 80 million cubic metres per year.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Ka&#146;awash said, &#147;We have been lied to; we have only
received 8 million cubic metres since 1995.&#148;</p>

Palestinian Authority Chairman Yaser Arafat of putting too much emphasis on attaining
&quot;statehood&quot; and in return ignoring the substance of statehood, Zionist pullout
from Palestinian land, including Jerusalem.<br>
One official, Ibrahim Yousef of the Ramallah area, pointed out that the main problem
facing the Palestinians was the Zionist occupation of our land not the establishment of
statehood.<br>
&quot;It is difficult to imagine how Arafat will establish his state while the Zionist
occupation remain intact,&quot; said Yousef during a seminar in Ramallah Wednesday.<br>
Yousef said he was worried Israel and the United States would seek to satiate Arafat's
infatuation with the trappings of a state by giving him a deformed quasi-state on a small
part of the West Bank whereby Jewish settlements will remain in place and al Quds
(Jerusalem) is left under<br>
Zionist hands.<br>
&quot;If he is so much bent on having a state, they (the Zionists and the Americans) will
probably give him one, but that is deformed, and lacking independence and freedom, and
above law one that covers a small fraction of Palestinian territories,&quot; said Yousef
in a telephone interview.<br>
Hamas supports the declaration of statehood on the 4th of May as a new phase of
