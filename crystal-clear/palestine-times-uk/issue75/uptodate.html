<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> <FONT SIZE=+2>Human Rights organizations censure Arafat</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> for closing Gaza institutions</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT(29 September)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights organizations have renewed their criticisms
of Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat for closing down sixteen
charitable and educational institutions in the Gaza Strip in submission
to Israeli and American demands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) has
labeled the closure of the civilian Islamic institutions &quot;a flagrant
violation of human rights and a serious transgression on the pillars of
civil society.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Basem Eid, Director-General of the PHRMG said in a telephone
interview on Monday 29 September the closure of the Gaza institutions amounted
to &quot;a blind submission to Zionist dictates.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the draconian measure was &quot;totally unjust,&quot;
opining that &quot;it will increase rather than reduce violence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eid, who is gathering details on each of the closed institutions,
said the only people who are now going be hurt by the closure are the poor
and orphan who have no where else to turn to for daily subsistence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;Some of these institutions used to provide the poor
with daily food supplement, so I don't  understand what purpose does it
serve to starve the poor, the orphan and the underprivileged.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eid ridiculed PA claims that the closure of the institutions
was aimed at serving Palestinian interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is extremely hard to believe that depriving children
from going to schools and closing kindergartens serves Palestinians' interests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Eid pointed out that the closed institutions
are located in the Gaza Strip where Arafat's authority is stronger, not
in the West Bank where the latest spate of bombings were presumably planned
and executed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said this suggests that the closure was politically
motivated, and had nothing to do with any genuine security considerations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, the another human rights organization, al Damir
(conscience) lambasted the PA for &quot;succumbing to Israeli demands.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The organization issued a written statement describing
the closure of the Gazan institutions as &quot;a clear assault on justice
and human rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, PA chairman Yasser Arafat reportedly told a
group of Hebron civic leaders that he realized that the closure of the Gaza
institutions was unjust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Arafat added that &quot;I have no choice in light
of the intense pressures I am facing.&quot;<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jordanian intelligence source: Israel stands</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>behind assassination attempt on Misha'al</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(28 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A junior Jordanian intelligence source revealed on Sunday
that the two Canadian &quot;tourists&quot; who attempted to assassinate
Hamas political bureau chief in Amman on Thursday were Canadian Jews from
Toronto and bore Israeli as well as Canadian passports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source also intimated that the two were part of a wider
network of Israeli secret agents who entered Jordan in early September for
the purpose of &quot;liquidating Hamas leaders in Jordan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source, who arrived in the West Bank on Friday and
who demanded anonymity, added that several Islamist leaders were on the
cell's hit list including, Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghoshe, Musa Abu Marzuk,
Muhammed Nazzal and Khalid Misha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the source pointed out that Israel and the United
States were exerting &quot;lots of behind-the-scene pressure&quot; on the
Jordanian government in order &quot;not to make a big fuss about what happened&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the treating American cardiologist who arrived
in Jordan on Friday from Cleveland, Ohio, at King Hussein's request, the
effect of the laser torrent which the perpetrators directed at Misha'al's
head was designed to cause Misha'al to die of &quot;respiratory failure
&quot; while sleeping, in order to make his death look as &quot;quiet and
as natural as possible.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The American physician, believed to be an authority on
brain functioning, reportedly said that the ray or laser torrent that penetrated
Misha'al brain had an after-effect on his respiratory system, which could
bring about sudden death if not resuscitated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the Gaza Strip, Hamas spokesman and leader Abdul Aziz
al Rantisi said he was now convinced that the Israeli intelligence stood
behind the assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi pointed out that the electronic device used by
the perpetrators was the state-of-the art, opining that a technologically
advanced country must have been behind the operation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi praised the &quot;vigilance and swift response&quot;
of Misha'al bodyguards who chased the perpetrators and enabled the Jordanian
police to catch them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Rantisi revealed that the Jordanian authorities
informed Hamas that &quot;the entire death team&quot; had been apprehended.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He expressed hope that the Jordanian government would not
succumb to Israeli and American pressure &quot;not to make an issue of the
incident&quot; because &quot;this is a flagrant assault on Jordanian sovereignty.&quot;<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat's police close down 16 Gaza institutions</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT(26 September)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a step that is ostensibly meant to appease Israel and
the United States, Palestinian Authority police closed down 16 social, charitable
and educational institutions in Gaza Thursday night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The closed institutions are reportedly run by Islamic elements
sympathetic to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Israel's arch enemy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The institutions include, inter alia, the Islamic Charitable
Society which provides freed food and clothing for the poor especially during
the month of Ramadan, the multi-activity Center known as al Mujamma'a al
Islami, the Muslim girl society, and the Holy Land society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, PA police closed down a private TV station, known
as the Al Ufuq (horizons) in Nablus which broadcast Quranic readings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources admit that there is no direct or indirect
linkage between the closed institutions and any political or military activities
related to Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A high-ranking PA official intimated that the closure was
only meant to &quot;mitigate the intensive pressure being exerted on us
by the Israeli and the Americans.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We told our brothers that we didn't mean to hurt
them...they didn't commit anything wrong after all...we just want to silence
those SOB's for a while.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, PA police arrested 12 Islamist activists in Nablus,
including Isa Abu al Ez, owner of the Ufuq TV station.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Israeli army continued its campaign against
suspected Islamic supporters throughout the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday 26 September, Israeli troops arrested Ismael
Al Awawdeh, head of the Engineering Department at Dura municipality and
Hashem Rajoub Secretary General of the Islamic Charitable Society in Dura.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, more than 700 Palestinians
have been arrested since the 31 July suicidal bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At least 500 people were sent to detention camps in central
Palestine where they are detained as hostages without charge or trial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elsewhere, in Dura thousands of townspeople performed the
congregational Friday prayer in the main street after the Israeli army closed
down the town's main mosque.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The imam, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub, described the closure of
the mosque as &quot;the most evil form of terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Can you think of a form of terrorism more diabolical
than preventing believers from praying at the house of God?&quot; Rajoub
said, addressing several thousand worshipers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub said Israel was no longer fighting Hamas, accusing
the Israeli occupation army &quot;of waging war on Islam, on the mosques,
and on our Prophet Muhammed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli army has closed down over 50 mosques in the
West Bank since the two recent suicidal bombings in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli authorities recognize the measure to be unfair.
However, they argue that Israel can not fight Palestinian resistance effectively
without &quot;inflicting collective pain and punishment on the larger Palestinian
population, Hamas' ultimate base.&quot; </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas: Israeli intelligence is behind assassination
</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>attempt in Amman</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (25 September)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has accused Israeli
intelligence of master-minding an assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al,
the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, that took place in Amman the morning
of 25 September.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas leader and spokesman in Gaza, Dr. Abdul Aziz al Rantisi
said he had no doubt whatsoever about the identity of the perpetrators,
saying &quot;Khalid Misha'al has one and only one enemy in this world and
that is the Zionist criminals.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi said in a telephone interview from his Gaza home
on the afternoon following the incident that he would not like to be hasty
in drawing conclusions, adding that if indeed it turned out that Israeli
agents were behind the assassination attempt, it would mean that Israel
has &quot;chosen to open wide a new door of confrontation with Muslims everywhere.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another Islamist spokesman, who asked for anonymity, said
&quot;Israel is playing with fire, and fire doesn't burn only Islamist leaders.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al's life reportedly
took place as he was on his way to work in Amman. According to Islamist
sources in the Jordanian capital, the incident was preceded by Mr. Misha'al
sensing that he was being followed by an unidentified car carrying five
men. Upon reaching his destination and alighting from his vehicle, two of
the men from the unfamiliar car were close behind him as he reached the
entrance of his building. As they got closer to him, he noticed that one
of the men was carrying a small, unidentified device which the assailant
attempted to deploy close to Mr. Misha'al's ear. However, one of the two
security guards looking after Mr. Misha'al was able to strike the assailant's
arm just before detonation. There was a loud noise and a sort of electric
shock that made Mr. Misha'al lose his sense of balance. It is still unknown
what the effect of this device would have been had the detonation been complete
and without interference. The two men attempted to flee the scene but were
captured by the security guards who subdued them until the arrival of the
police and their eventual arrest. The other three accomplices escaped in
their vehicle. According to the security guards, all five are believed to
be non-Arab nationals. In the interim, Mr. Misha'al was rushed to hospital
and is still under observation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier this month, the internal Israeli ministerial council
on security adopted a number of secret recommendations against Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, the recommendations included
&quot;reactivating Mossad death squads in Jordan,&quot; an allusion to carrying
out assassinations of Islamist leaders in Jordan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two years ago, the murder of the Palestinian Islamist guerrilla
Yahya Ayyash by the Israeli intelligence sparked off a series of deadly
urban bomb attacks in Israel in which over 100 Israeli soldiers and civilians
were killed.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Following Hitler's footsteps:</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Victims of Jewish ethnic cleansing languish
in homelessness</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(23 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hundreds of Palestinian victims of the Israeli policy of
ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem have entered their second month at a
makeshift refugee camp at the Suwwana neighborhood, across the Mount of
Olives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The camp, say Palestinians, only epitomizes the increasingly
acute ordeal of Jerusalemite Arabs whom the Israeli seek to drive out &quot;by
hook or crook&quot; in order to check Arab population growth in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Today, the &quot;Jerusalem Camp of Steadfastness&quot;
is &quot;home&quot; to as many as seventy Palestinian families, including
at least 35 children below the age of eight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, the Israeli municipal authorities have behaved
totally callously towards the refugees, refusing to &quot;recognize the
camp&quot; nor provide refugees with electricity and water supplies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Israeli callousness doesn't seem to deter the
refugees or weaken their resolve.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are here to demonstrate to the whole world the
racist, Nazi nature of the Israeli authorities which refuse to treat us
as human beings,&quot; said Um Ahmed, a woman refugee at the camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Look! they just don't want us to be in Jerusalem
because we are not Jews...It is like the Nazis who wanted to have a pure
Arian Germany.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another woman, Maha Jayyousi, cited a different reason
for becoming a refugee in her own town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;For 15 years my husband and I have been trying to
obtain a building license from the Israeli municipal authorities, but to
no avail...they told us 'if you don't like it, you can leave the town..
and we would help you leave if and when you decide to do so,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jayyousi recognized that &quot;life here is difficult&quot;
and that &quot;things are particularly difficult for the children.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Life here is difficult, but being contiguous to Jerusalem
makes us forget all hardship.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Virtually all refugees vow to stay at the camp until &quot;our
just demands are met.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are not asking for the impossible.. we just want
to be treated on equal footing with other human beings,&quot; said Waheed
al Resheq, pointing out to his married son Muhammed, also a refugee, whose
residency right had been withdrawn by the Israeli interior ministry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;See, they took away his identity card because he
lived for six months at the Ram outskirt after he couldn't find housing
in East Jerusalem.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdullah Burqan, another refugee at the camp, voices essentially
the same grievances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Israelis have one goal, that it is to force us
out of Jerusalem; and since they can't just collectively expel us outside
the town for public relations considerations, they create a situation in
which our life in the town becomes unbearable, so that we would leave <I>voluntarily.</I>&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The refugees hope that media coverage of their plight would
prompt Israel to reconsider its stance on their cause. However, this doesn't
seem to forthcoming.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians: Israel is launching war on
Islam</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (22 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation troops raided the Grand Mosque in Dura
after midnight Sunday in the latest attack on Islamic holy places in the
occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to local Palestinian sources, scores of Israeli
soldiers forced an entry into the mosque around shortly after midnight Sunday,
presumably to carry out searches for &quot;inciting materials.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Mosque Muezzin, Ja'afar Dasseh, said the soldiers behaved
with obvious disrespect inside the mosque and stepped on copies of the Qura'an.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the commanding officer then produced a poorly-written
closure order saying that the mosque, the largest in the Hebron area, be
closed off for one month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Salah al Natshe, Head of Hebron Wakf Department,
strongly condemned the Israeli army transgression against Islamic holy places
.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;When somebody writes a graffiti at a Jewish grave
in a remote part of Europe or North America, they make a big fuss about
it; however when their murderous soldiers and settlers desecrate Muslim
mosques and Christian churches, nobody says anything.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Natshe pointed out that Israeli army attacks on Islamic
holy places in the West Bank have assume phenomenal proportions of late.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said Israeli raids on mosques and their imams have become
&quot;almost a daily occurrence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The matter is simply a dirty war by Jews on Islam,
the Qura'an and the holy prophet.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Muhammed Ayyash, a clerk at the Bethlehem Wakf Department,
concurred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He pointed out that the Israeli army has arrested as many
as local imams at the villages of Tku, al Khader, Beit Fajjar and the Dheisheh
refugee camp in the last two weeks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ayyash admitted that the vindictive arrests were undermining
the holding of prayers at the respective mosques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, as many as 600 Israeli soldiers raided the village
of Asira al Shamaliyya near Nablus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Assa'ad Sawalmeh, head of the local council, said the heavily-armed
soldiers raided homes, beat up defenseless villagers and arrested scores
of youth for &quot;harboring Islamic tendencies.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sawalmeh pointed out that the Israeli troops, commanded
by Uzi Dayyan (Israeli army commander in the West Bank) forced as many as
600 local citizens into the local school where they subjected them to various
forms of humiliation and occasional beating.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meanwhile, the Israeli troops confined Palestinian
Authority policemen to their local center, preventing them to leave the
premise &quot;until further notice.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli operation at the village lasted for more than
12 hours, and as many as 25 local citizens were arrested. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians reject the Ras-al-Amud &quot;Joke&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(20 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A general state of tension continued to prevail in Israeli-occupied
East Jerusalem despite the conclusion on Thursday night of a &quot;compromise
agreement&quot; between the Israeli government and the Jewish settlers who
earlier had seized two Arab houses at the Ras al Amud neighborhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The agreement, which Palestinians branded as &quot;silly
joke&quot; stipulated that the three Jewish families who had entered the
premise be evacuated and replaced by ten students belonging to the ultra
fanatic Gush Emunim movement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources described the new settlers as &quot;potential
murderers&quot; and &quot;indoctrinated in hate of everything Arab.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians at all levels flatly rejected the &quot;silly
joke,&quot; labeling it as &quot;a deal between thieves.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faisal Husseini, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in the
Palestinian Authority, described the &quot;deal&quot; as &quot;a naked trick&quot;
and &quot;a crime greater than its predecessor.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA minister of Information, Yasser Abed Rabbu, said the
&quot;Jewish-Jewish deal&quot; was like an understanding between &quot;field
gangsters and mafia heads.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abed Rabbu denounced the American stance on the matter,
saying it provided a political cover for colonialist Jewish activities in
Arab Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat rejected the deal between
the Netanyahu government and settler leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This is a big trick, a public relations ploy to perpetuate
Jewish colonialism at Ras al Amud,&quot; Arafat reportedly told a meeting
of the Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo on Saturday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Jewish settler leaders lauded the &quot;deal&quot;
as &quot;a victory for our cause.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The families have left; the people who remained are
here to guard the property and make renovations, because at some point the
families will come back here..this is only temporary,&quot; said settler
leader Hagit Harel, a spokesman for the group of settlers who seized the
building last week.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another settler, Shimon Gaznov, said he and five fellow
settlers planned to get to work soon on putting up partitions and laying
ceramic tiles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, more Palestinian protests are planned for this
week outside the premise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Saturday, Palestinian school children in East Jerusalem
staged a demonstration demanding &quot;the removal of settlers from our
midst.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Palestinian leaders vowed to continue their protests
until the Israeli government remove the settlers for good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Palestinian Islamist sources discounted
Israeli claims concerning the apprehension of two armed Islamic cells in
East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Islamist source in the West Bank town of Hebron said
the Israeli claims to that effect &quot;were fraught with exaggeration&quot;
and &quot;aimed at boosting the morale of the Israeli public following recent
bombings in West Jerusalem and Israeli army losses in South Lebanon.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, the Israeli intelligence service (Shabak) disclosed
that two Hamas and Islamic Jihad cells had been captured, and that members
of the first cell had planned to kidnap West Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli interrogators torture Palestinian
detainee to death</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (17 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Intelligence agents have tortured a 31-year-old
Palestinian political detainee to death, Israeli and Palestinian sources
said Wednesday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The detainee, Marwan Hasan Ibrahim Ma'ali, of the village
of <I>A'jja</I> near Jenin was strangled to death at the hands of three
Israeli Shabak interrogators at the Megiddo detention camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli army spokesman said Ma'ali died in &quot;vague
circumstances&icirc; and &igrave;may have committed suicide.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, a number of his friends reportedly strongly denied
the Israeli claim, saying &quot;it was a routine ruse to conceal the crime.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Marwan didn't commit suicide, he was murdered by
the criminal thugs&quot; said one inmate from Hebron, referring to Shabak
interrogators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to his family, Ma'ali never had mental or psychological
problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>His friend, Ragheb, from <I>A'jja</I> flatly denied the
Israeli insinuation that Ma'ali committed suicide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Why would he commit suicide. He was in good health,
he was married and father of three children, and had no social or psychological
problems,&quot; said Ragheb.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Isa Karaqe'i, head of the Palestinian Prisoner Club, said
&quot;I'm a hundred per cent sure that Shabak agents murdered Marwan.. he
was not the kind of person who would commit suicide.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This (the suicide claim) is not the first, nor would
be the last claim of its kind by those evil murderers...They always perpetrate
their crimes and then seek to conceal them in a variety of sinister ways.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group,
Ma'ali was arrested on 4 August following the 31 bombing in West Jerusalem.
An administrative detention order for two months was issued for him. His
family was not allowed to visit him, despite an illness that Ma'ali suffered
from. The family tried to pass medical documents related to the illness
through the Red Cross, but without success.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ma'ali's body was taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute
for an autopsy. He was due to be buried Wednesday night at his village.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ma'ali was detained without charge or trial, like about
a thousand other Palestinians currently held hostage by the Israeli government,
not knowing why they are being detained nor if and when they would be let
go.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ma'ali leaves behind him a pregnant wife and three children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel is the only country in the world that legalizes
the use of torture against detainees. So far, as many as 15 Palestinians
died of torture in Israeli custody since the signing of the Oslo Agreement
four years ago. <BR>

E. Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT(15 September)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Flying in the face of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright who called on Israel to refrain from taking unilateral steps in
the West Bank, Israeli settlers last night seized two Arab houses at the
Ras al Amud neighborhood in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The settlers, supported by influential government ministers
and American Jewish businessmen, apparently hope the two houses would make
a nucleus for a larger Jewish colony in the heart of the predominantly Arab
neighborhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ultimate aim of the settlers and their supporters seems
to be the obliteration of the Arab-Islamic identity of East Jerusalem and
pushing the Palestinians to leave the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the seizure of the houses, hundreds of Palestinians
and Israelis staged a protest against the new provocative colony in the
heart of East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Among the protesters, were Faisal Husseini, Legislative
Council member Hatem Abdul Kader, and several Israeli Knesset members representing
the Meretz movement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking to reporters, Husseini reminded the Israelis that
Palestinians still owned &quot;more than 70 % of West Jerusalem.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, Palestinians do have land rights covering more
than 80% of real estate in Palestine, which Zionists occupied through aggression
and terrorism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Palestinian sources expressed doubts about the
reality of what happened at Ras al Amud last night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One Palestinian official told this reporter that Benyamin
Netanyahu wanted to improve his image and appear as opposing the settlers
in case he would decide to evict them from the site.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu and his foreign minister David Levy have expressed
reservations about the seizure of the two houses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli occupation troops continued
to round up Palestinians and dump them into collective detention camps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday night, more than 20 people were arrested in villages
around Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, more than 500 Palestinians have been abducted or
detained since 31 July.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Normally, the detainees don't know why they were arrested
or how long they will stay in the detention camp. No charges are brought
against them, nor are they tried. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Albright's Odious Lies</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Comment by: Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During her maiden visit to Palestine and the Autonomous
enclaves, US Secretary of State Madleine Albright made a preponderance of
half-truths, corrupt analogies, spurious conclusions and even some malicious
outright lies. In fact, one can safely argue that willful mendacity and
deliberate malice represented the gist of her numerous speeches and statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Making &quot;Israeli security&quot; at the heart of her
talks and conversations with her Israeli and Palestinian interlocutors,
Albright unashamedly claimed that &quot;terrorism&quot; was by far the main
cause of the current stalemate of the moribund peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Obviously, this is an outright lie, and the Zionist lady,
who has all pertinent CIA reports ready at her service, knows as well as
anybody else and, certainly, more than most people, that her assertion was
false to put mildly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright knows that Benyamin Netanyahu sent his bulldozers
to pulverize occupied land at Jabal Abu Ghuneim long before there were bombings
in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionist lady must also be aware that the &quot;massacre
of Palestinian homes&quot; or home-demolition, along with flagrant land
seizure, ethnic cleansing in al Quds, and Jewish settlement expansion were
continuing at a frantic pace well before the bombings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other words, what she so lightly calls &quot;terrorism&quot;
effectively has nothing to do with the fate to which the originally precarious
process has been consigned. The truth of the matter is Israeli, Jewish terrorism,
towards which she is either silent or supportive, caused the current stalemate,
triggering off the recent bombings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, and with all honesty, it is more than fair to
say that the bombings, as indeed all other forms of Palestinian resistance
to the evil Zionist occupation, have been, are, and continue to be the &quot;<I>EFFECT</I>&quot;
rather than the &quot;<I>Cause</I>&quot; of Israel's persistent policy in
the West Bank that is aimed at dispossessing the Palestinians of their homeland,
which would turn them in effect into the &quot;Red Indians of the Middle
East.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, for God's sake, what are the Palestinians supposed
to behave in the face of the overwhelming Israeli oppression and torment.
They did give peace a chance, and the result was only narrower horizons
and tighter nooses around their necks. Now, If they don't do anything, they
will be &quot;disposed of&quot; quietly and silently. And if they try to
fight back their wicked and arrogant enemy, which has the US at its beck
and call, they will be branded as &quot;terrorists and murderers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright's most scandalous and manifestly idiotic statement
was, however, when she unashamedly and nonchalantly claimed that &quot;Hamas
and the Islamic Jihad movements (not Israel) were the average Palestinian's
enemy.&quot; Clearly, this is a cardinal insult to peoples' intelligence
because Mrs. Albright would like to make us believe that Hamas, not Israel,
is the party that is destroying Palestinian homes, confiscating Palestinian
land, besieging Palestinian towns and villages, and, not the least, practicing
ethnic cleansing against Palestinians in East Jerusalem...!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas is not the enemy of the Palestinian people. And 99.999%
of the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim peoples do believe that Israel and her
backers are the enemies of the Palestinians and Muslims the world over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our enemy is our tormentor, the occupier of land, and the
usurper of our rights. Our enemy is the one that says to our enemy &quot;we
are with you for ever&quot; and vows to &quot;maintain your qualitative
edge over all other Arabs and Muslims.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But one should not be surprised by statements as such,
coming from the lady who refused to blame the Israeli army for massacring
100 defenseless Lebanese men, women and children at Qana in April of 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, one should be surprised, even affronted, by those
Arab and Muslim leaders who entrust the American Zionist lady with paramount
Arab and Muslim issues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright openly says that all Arabs and Muslims are not
worth a Jew's finger-nail &quot;as far as she is concerned.&quot; In other
words, she already made up her mind about us, and the verdict is negative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, no amount of sycophancy and pleasantry would
change her mind on or about us. She is simply the enemy and the judge combined,
isn't she?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Arabs and Muslims do have an option, if they decide
to free themselves from the curse of subservience to America. They must
start giving more attention to their own peoples' feelings. They must learn
to value the legitimacy that comes from their peoples' acceptance more than
that which comes from the foreigners' acceptance, because then they would
be stronger and less vulnerable to external blackmail and pressure.<BR>

qualitative edge&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(10 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived in
Tel Aviv Wednesday morning, has reasserted &quot;America&iacute;s iron-clad
commitment to Israel's security and well-being.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking in West Jerusalem at a reception hosted by Israeli
President Ezer Weisman, Albright said she was carrying &quot;a clear message
from President Clinton that the United States stands firm behind Israel
in the fight against terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright said the United States also supports Israeli demands
that Palestinian chairman Yasser Arafat make a hundred per cent effort to
fight terrorism and dismantle terrorist infrastructure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Albright reiterated the traditional American
commitment to Israel&iacute;s security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I'd like to reaffirm our unflinching commitment to
Israel's qualitative military and technological edge,&quot; she Weisman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright, flying in the face of Arab and Palestinian expectations,
didn't touch on the subject of Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank,
which is widely viewed as the root cause of the present crisis in the peace
process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Predictably, Albright&iacute;s remarks invited Palestinian
consternation and anger.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Her statements don't auger good for the future...we
hoped she would take a fairly balanced approach to issues, I am very disappointed,&quot;
said Yasser Arafat's media advisor Marwan Kanafani.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kanafani added that &quot;if indeed her remarks epitomized
here mission in the area, she would fail in her task to bring the peace
process back on track.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright is slated to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu this afternoon, and latter with foreign minister David
Levy and Defense Minister Yitshak Mordechai. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Later on, she is expected to meet with Labour Party leader
Ehud Barak, before traveling to the West Bank of Ramalla where she will
meet with Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright, a Jew of Czech origin, will also visit some of
the wounded from the latest bombing at hospital and meet with families of
Israeli missing soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, she will return to the Ramalla to brief Arafat
on her talks with Netanyahu, then she will leave for Damascus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Netanyahu sought to dispel Arab hopes that Albright
would exert pressure on Israel on the settlement issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;No pressure will be exerted on Israel. We are not
operating in a framework of pressure...So far as Israel is concerned what
is at stake are the most basic existential issues and the US fully comprehends
that this is the case.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Netanyahu dismissed suggestions that the American
Secretary of State might go over his head and address the Israeli people
directly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are allies, and it is most natural, logical and
desirable that she speak to the Israeli people,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last night, the Israeli government released a document
containing ten Israeli demands on the PA considered prerequisites for the
resumption of peace talks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These include, among other things, the disarming of thousands
of Palestinian policemen, cutting the size of the Palestinian police force
to half the current number, handing over suspected &quot;terrorists,&quot;
stopping incitement against Israel, arresting the opponents of the Israeli
occupation and dismantling their social, educational and religious infrastructure,
and fighting terrorism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The stated Israeli dictates were labeled as &quot;impossible&quot;
by Nabil Amre, a legislative council member and advisor for PA chairman
Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas: Albright, Netanyahu &quot;tweedledum
and tweedledee&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (10 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has condemned American
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the Middle East, saying
it is aimed at &quot;pressuring the Arabs into giving yet more concessions
to the extremist government in Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An official spokesman for the movement in Hebron contended
that &quot;all that Albright is trying to do is bring the Palestinian Authority
to its knees.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You know, in the final analysis Mrs. Albright and
Mr. Netanyahu are tweedledum and tweedledee.&quot; said Hasan al Natshe,
a prominent Islamist leader in the southern part of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Natshe, who spent several years in an Israeli detention
camp, said the PA and other Arab leaders shouldn't expect good &quot;from
this Zionist lady.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Building hopes on her current mission is like expecting
justice at a thieves' den and safety at a snake's hole...America is the
executive enemy of Muslims,&quot; said al Natshe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamist leader, furthermore, lambasted Arab leaders
for &quot;trusting the collective Arab and Muslim interests to the good-will
of the United States.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said the United States doesn't respect Arab leaders
precisely because they strive to appease the White House in blunt disregard
for their peoples' feelings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The way to force America to view us with deference
and respect is to extract ourselves from subservience to the Americans and
to try to be free and independent.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Which comes first, &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;security?&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh (West Bank)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As US Secretary of State Albright embarks on her much-heralded
mission to the Middle East, Palestinian Authority officials have expressed
hopes that America's top diplomat would take &quot;a balanced and equitable
approach to the grave crisis engulfing the peace process.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We hope that Mrs. Albright won't be carried away
by Netanyahu's tendentious overemphasis on security issues,&quot; said PA
Chairman Yasser Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, on the eve of Albright's
arrival in Palestine. He added, rather ominously, that &quot;if the root
causes of violence are not dealt with effectively, the crisis will only
deepen in gravity and widen in scope.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Chief Palestinian negotiator, Dr.Saeb Ureikat,
stressed that the success of Albright's current mission in the region &quot;would
mostly if not solely depend on the extent to which she makes a genuine balance
between our need for justice and freedom, and the Israeli need for security.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The two are inextricably entwined; there can be no
peace without security, and no security without peace,&quot; said Ureikat,
adding that &quot;Israel can't continue to arrogate our rights and have
security at the same time.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, most Palestinian officials don't seem to give Albright
the benefit of the doubt, given her anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian record
during her tenure as US Ambassador to the United Nations. On Tuesday, 9
Sept. a high-ranking PA official intimated to this correspondent that the
Palestinian leadership didn't expect the &quot;flatly pro-Israeli lady to
pressure Netanyahu to change his heart and mind on the central issue of
Palestinian rights.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian official added, with marked disillusionment,
that &quot;it would be naive on the part of the PA leadership to expect
the United States under any circumstances to be an impartial and evenhanded
broker between Israel and the Palestinians, unless it is forced to do so.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As to what would force the American administration to reconsider
its oblique approach to the Palestinian problem, the official said &quot;a
united Arab stance.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly, the Palestinians seem to be seriously worried
that Albright would pay unduly ample attention to the &quot;symptom&quot;
(e.g. the terrorism issue ) but give a disingenuous, passing glance at &quot;the
root cause.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 8 Sept. a prominent Palestinian official warned that
&quot;if peace is not achieved on the Palestinian track, there will eventually
be no peace on the other tracks.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Tayyeb Abdul Rahim, Secretary-General of the PA Ministerial
Council, told the &quot;Voice of Palestine&quot; that &quot;Israel's peace
treaties with both Jordan and Egypt would suffer seriously if Netanyahu
reneged on the peace process and insisted on adopting a take and leave it
approach to Palestinian rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are at the heart of the problem in the Middle
East, and if the heart of the problem is left unresolved, chaos and turbulence
will spread all over the region,&quot; Abdul Rahim Rahim said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Rahim's remarks probably the present mode of thinking
in the Palestinian Authority and the region at large. Earlier, another Palestinian
official who spoke on condition of anonymity hinted that Israel's continued
disregard for Palestinian rights was &quot;creating new generations of suicidal
bombers not only in Palestine but throughout the Arab and Muslim world.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The grave hint coincided with revelations, reportedly made
last week by the Israeli intelligence and communicated to the United States,
that the two suicidal bombers who carried out the 31 July double-bombing
in West Jerusalem came from abroad, a view all along held by PA chairman
Yasser Arafat. If indeed, this turns out to be true, a new significant and
grave variable would be appearing at the Palestinian-Israeli arena, resulting
in unpredictable ramifications.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat's dilemma</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The exacerbation of the &quot;suicidal phenomenon&quot;
must have been in Arafat's mind when he met in Cairo earlier this week with
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan. According to
aides, Arafat told Mubarak and Hussein that Netanyahu's policies in the
West Bank were pushing the Palestinian public opinion to the boiling point
and that, given this, he (Arafat) was finding it increasingly difficult
to fight violence let alone isolate Hamas without risking being viewed as
an Israeli collaborator along Antoin Lahed's lines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat's argument seemed to be largely justified. The bulk
of Palestinians in the occupied territories, while not overly supportive
of suicidal bomb attacks such as the two that hit West Jerusalem in the
last few weeks, do pin the blame for the escalation of violence and bloodshed
almost squarely on the Israeli government policies. A University of Hebron
professor told a local audience last week that &quot;Netanyahu was offering
us either of two choices, surrender or suicidal bombers.&quot; Interestingly,
this view seems to be shared by a growing number of Palestinians who have
already lost or about to lose hope of a genuine and just peace &quot;as
long as things remain as they are.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This state of hopelessness and &quot;frozen rage&quot;
does explain Arafat's relative reluctance to launch massive arrests among
Hamas supporters in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the past, Arafat carried out such arrests with little
compunction, presumably because he thought that Hamas was undermining national
achievements and seeking to &quot;kill the Palestinian new-born.&quot; Moreover,
the two former Israeli premiers, Rabin and Peres, at least gave him something
to build on, actually or imaginatively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, all that has changed, with Netanyahu working strenuously
and relentlessly to narrow Palestinian horizons and eviscerate the Oslo
Accords of any meaningful substance. Indeed, it seems that Arafat has come
to realize that Netanyahu may be after him and after the Palestine Authority
as much as he is after Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Hence, Arafat's hesitation
to succumb to Israeli dictates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Added to this is the re imposition by Israel of the month-long
closure on Palestinian population centers, which effectively reduced towns
and villages into &quot;closed off ghettoes.&quot; Moreover, the re imposition
of the &quot;closure,&quot; ostensibly prompted by the triple suicidal bomb
attack in West Jerusalem on 4 Sept, placed the originally weak Palestinian
economy in an unprecedently precarious situation, forcing the PA cut on
public spending and to postpone until further notice the payment of salaries
to its 100,000 or so military and civilians employees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The logic behind Israel's draconian measures against the
Palestinians is that by &igrave;further narrowing their horizons and tightening
the noose around them, they would be prompted to turn against Hamas, which
brought on them Israel's wrath.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the draconian Israeli measures, often accompanied
by brutal mistreatment of ordinary Palestinians at ubiquitous Israeli checkpoints
and roadblocks, seem to boomerang against Israel. The seizure of the occupied
territories and the cordoning-off of Palestinian towns and villages only
serves to direct Palestinian indignation towards the occupiers not Hamas.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Islamist leaders have strongly criticised the
Jordan for arresting Hamas spokesman, Ibrahim Ghosheh, on Monday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, issued a carefully-worded
statement describing the arrest as &quot;provocative&quot; and denouncing
it as &quot;totally unjustified.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement said Ghosheh didn't do any wrong-doing, adding
that his &quot;flagrant arrest&quot; was only meant to &quot;appease our
enemy, Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The arrest of Gosheh has also been condemned by the Muslim
Brotherhood movement in the Occupied Territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the movement in East Jerusalem, Jamal Sharif,
castigated the arrest of &quot;brother Gosheh because he spoke out against
Israeli occupation and savagery.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ibrahim Gosheh's son, Omar, said his father had gone on
hunger strike to protest his flagrant detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, the Jordanian Information minister, Samir Mutawi'
said &quot;Gosheh was arrested because he posed a threat to state security.&quot;</FONT></P>

in West Jerusalem was a reaction to Israel's blatant treatment of Palestinians.</FONT></P>

to inflict</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>maximum distress and pain on Palestinian
families</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (8 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights organizations in the occupied territories
have accused the Israeli army of seeking to &quot;inflict maximum distress
and pain on Palestinian families by sending hundreds of innocent Palestinians
to detention camps in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, the Jerusalem-based Human Rights Centre (HRC)
said in a statement that &quot;Israeli soldiers were using a variety of
physical and psychological methods designed to inflict maximum suffering
on Palestinian detainees.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These methods, include, inter alia, hand-cuffing, hooding
(placing a filthy-smelling sack on the detainees head for weeks or months),
sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, severe beating and kicking, shaking,
and threats of physical liquidation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>the statement said the latest Israeli army arrests were
random in nature and were aimed at &quot;rounding as many people as possible
in order to make things difficult for their families.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In numerous cases, the statement said, the arrests were
carried out haphazardly, adding that it was manifestly obvious that they
didn't have any legitimate security justification, but mainly meant to &quot;inflict
harm and collective punishment on the entire Palestinian community.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The HRC cited the example of Khalil Elyas Karrat, 30, of
Betunya near Ramallah. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (7 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A high-ranking Palestinian Authority official warned on
Sunday 7 September that Israel's peace treaties with both Jordan and Egypt
would suffer irremediably if Israel reneged on the Oslo Agreement and insisted
on adopting &quot;a take it or leave it&quot; approach Palestinian rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Tayyeb Abdul Rahim, secretary-general of the PA ministerial
council, said in an interview with <I>Voice of Palestine</I> that Israel
should understand that there can be no peace between Israel on the one hand
and Egypt and Jordan on the other, if there is no peace between the Jewish
state and the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are the heart of the problem in the Middle East,
and if the heart of the problem is left unresolved, chaos and instability
will spread all over the region,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Rahim castigated the Israeli government for &quot;seeking
to evade the fundamental issue of its occupation and colonization of Arab
land by placing disproportionate emphasis on the security issue.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The security issue is the effect, not the cause,&quot;
said Abdul Rahim, adding that by so doing, Israel was trying to eviscerate
the Oslo Accords of any meaningful substance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another Palestinian official, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, accused
the Israeli government of &quot;seeking to alter the pillars upon which
the entire peace process is based,&quot; namely, UN resolutions 242 and
338 and the principle of land for peace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Rudeineh told Journalists in Gaza Sunday that the Israeli
suggestion that both sides move immediately to the final status talks was
aimed at diluting the peace process and exempting the Israeli government
from carrying out commitments stipulated under the intermediate phase.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These, Abu Rudeineh said, include, among other things,
the opening of the Gaza airport and the safe passage between Gaza and the
West Bank, release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention camps
in addition to the second and third redeployment phases.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sharpening tone of the Palestinian authority follows
an Israeli government decision on Friday to effectively freeze the peace
process, including the scheduled Israeli army redeployment from parts of
&quot;area C,&quot; slated to begin in November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The subject is expected to the heart of US Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's upcoming talks with Israeli and Arab leaders.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>On Netanyahu's perverted logic, latest Jerusalem
bombing</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (7 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As usual, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu sought
to twist the facts following the 5 September aborted raid in Lebanon in
which 12 of his soldiers were killed by Hizbullah fighters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu said on Friday 5 Sep., hours after his army's
fiasco at al Ansariyya, and again on Sunday, that Israel would continue
to launch a determined and merciless war against what he called &igrave;those
vile terrorists,&icirc; an obvious allusion to Hamas and Hizbullah freedom-fighters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, the pugnacious and impetuous premier would like to
make us believe that his soldiers were on a humanitarian mission in Lebanon..
to heal the sick, feed the hungry and comfort the inflicted, only to be
suddenly intercepted and confronted by <I>evil</I> Hizbullah fighters who,
not realizing the lofty nature of their altruistic mission, slew them into
shreds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other words, Netanyahu thinks that the normal order
of things is for Lebanese to make their land a &quot;free arena&quot; for
the <I>T'sahal</I> (the Israeli army) and not to intercept or harm any Israeli
soldier, tank, or plane, implanting death and havoc on Lebanese towns and
villages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, when one is affronted, as often, with a sick mentality
as such, with an oblique mind-set as such, with a logic as perverse and
wicked as Netanyahu&iacute;s, he or she can only marvel at the depravity
and morbidity of the collective thinking of the Israeli political establishment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Israel has always sought to change the black into white,
the lie, the ugly lie, into a <I>truth</I> glorified by thousands, and,
of course, the oppressed victims of aggression and occupation, into terrorists
and gangsters intent on the destruction of Israel and the extermination
of its people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Lebanon, Netanyahu and his parroting mouthpieces try
relentlessly to project the problem as that of &quot;terrorists resisting
the Israeli occupation&quot; not one of &quot;the Israeli occupation of
Lebanese land.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Likewise, in the West Bank the problem becomes the security
of the military Israeli occupation and that of the murderous Israeli settlers,
not that of Israel's evil occupation of the life and land of the Palestinian
people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, what are the Muslim fighters and peoples supposed to
do in the face of Zionist hegemony, savagery and occupation. Turn the other
cheek? Or perhaps, thank the sons of the spirit for their humanitarian missions
in Lebanon and the West Bank?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionist cannibalists, one must point out, were on their
way to murder and maim innocent civilians at al Ansariyya. They were going
to pour death on the heads of Lebanese men, women and children. They were
going to cause more Lebanese mothers to become widowed, more children to
become orphaned, and more families to get bereaved. Their mission was &quot;Mission
Blood.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, they received their just nemesis, and others would
receive theirs, because those who live by the sword will die by the sword.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian situation is no different. The Israeli
establishment has been trying to annihilate the Palestinian people in ways
not dissimilar from the fate that the American Indians eventually faced
in North America.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thus, Palestinian land is stolen at gun point, Palestinian
homes are destroyed at gun point and Palestinians, men, women and children,
are murdered by blood-thirsty Israeli soldiers and settlers who believe
that a non-Jewish life is utterly insignificant in the Lord's sight and
may be, therefore, disposed of without much compunction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, when Palestinians seek to resist their Israeli tormentors,
they are branded as &quot;vile terrorists&quot; and vilified a &quot;killers
who seek to destroy Israel and murder its citizens.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Given this obliquity of thinking, it becomes amply clear
that any change on the ground must be preceded by a change, even a radical
metamorphosis, in Israel's abnormal and morbid perception of its actual
and potential Muslim victims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, this change doesn't seem to be forthcoming,
to say the least. Hence, the plains of Lebanon, like the streets of Jerusalem,
will continue to soak in blood, Muslim and Jewish, until right prevails
over might. </FONT></P>

triple bombing</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (5 September)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu launched a vitriolic
attack on Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat Friday, accusing
him of &quot;utter inability to fight terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking on Israeli television channel I, Netanyahu said
Thursday's triple suicidal bombing in West Jerusalem was a stark proof that
&quot;something ought to be done,&quot; adding rather ominously that &quot;from
now on we won't continue this way.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many observers here interpreted Netanyahu's remarks as
giving a green light to Israeli security forces to operate freely and less
discreetly inside the PA-administered autonomous enclaves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday night while visiting some of the wounded of the
bombings at Shaar Zedek hospital in West Jerusalem, Netanyahu seemed determined
to punish the Palestinian authority for the second suicidal bombing in a
month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The citizens of Israel will not be guinea pigs to
test Yasser Arafat's goodwill or credibility. I am not ready to continue
this way. We will go a different route. We will fundamentally reassess the
entire process,&quot; Netanyahu said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli premier added that &quot;we had given Arafat
and the Palestinian Authority a chance and they had failed abysmally. The
time has come for us to draw the proper conclusions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Under the Oslo Agreement, Israeli forces, particularly
the so-called &quot;undercover death squads&quot; are accorded &quot;full
freedom&quot; to operate within PA-held areas provided their movement not
be conspicuous.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, an Israeli undercover unit entered the PA-controlled
town of Tulkarm, abducting an Islamist activist who had escaped from an
Israeli detention centre.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Netanyahu government, as did the Rabin-Peres
governments, has not sought to &quot;overuse&quot; this &quot;right&quot;
for fear of corroding PA chairman Arafat's credibility in the eyes of his
people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meanwhile, Israeli security officials admitted that
here was not much they can do to &quot;put an end to suicidal bombings.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, the Israeli Hebrew daily Yedeot Ahranot quoted
a high-ranking Israeli army commander as saying that &quot;under current
circumstances there is not much we can do to stop terrorist attacks of this
kind.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The commander pointed out that &quot;the deployment of
more troops in urban centres proved inadequate to prevent suicidal attacks
and the closure of the territories (the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) also
proved ineffective.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Voicing mounting frustration at his own inability to prevent
suicidal bombings by radical Islamists, Israeli Police Inspector-General
Assaf Hefetz, suggested that Israel &quot;reoccupy Palestinian towns and
destroy terrorist infrastructure.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;If we don&iacute;t take care of the infrastructure
then we can&iacute;t ensure that three won&iacute;t be more attacks. The
way we handle the infrastructure is the key. we can&iacute;t rely on defensive
measures.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat Condemns</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Facing mounting Israeli and American pressure to &quot;fight
terrorism,&quot; Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat repeatedly
condemned the triple suicidal bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Palestinian leader dismissed the Israeli charges
that he bore responsibility for the attack as &quot;silly.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat said he was sure that the perpetrators of the bombings
came from outside, hinting that they were sent by Hizbullah to avenge the
killing by the Israeli army last month of three of its military commanders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I can&iacute;t be responsible for this. I don&iacute;t
control the borders and the crossing points,&quot; Arafat said in an interview
with CBS Thursday night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the beleaguered Palestinian leader defended his
meetings with Hamas leaders in Gaza two weeks ago, saying that (Hamas leader
Abdul Aziz) al Rantisi was against terrorism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Arafat doesn't seem to be able to retain his ostensible
steadfastness in the face Israeli and American coercion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, PA security agents arrested
two leading Islamists in the Nablus and Ramalla areas last night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources said Preventive Security agents detained Jamal
Mansur, and Islamist leader in Nablus, and Muhammed Muslih from Ramallh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA acknowledged the arrest, saying that &quot;the two
made interviews with foreign TV networks during which they made statements
incompatible with Palestinian national interests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (3 September)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jewish settlers went on the rampage Monday 2 Sept. in several
Nablus villages, uprooting trees, vandalizing agricultural crops and shooting
a Palestinian teenager.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to local sources in Nablus, a group of heavily-armed
settlers from the Settlement of Kadumim marauded throughout the villages
of Kufr Kaddum, Ainabus and Deir Abu Daif near Nablus, ostensibly to terrorize
Palestinian villagers in the hope that they would abandon their land for
the Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Villagers said the settlers rooted out as many as 100 olive
trees at Kufr Kaddum.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The villagers said the settlers engraved several racist
slogans on tree stems including &igrave;Kahane Hay,&icirc; &igrave;death
to Arabs,&icirc; &igrave;revenge,&icirc; and &igrave;kill the Arabs.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed M. Jaludi, who owns some of the extirpated trees,
said the settlers were carrying a diesel-operated saw which they used in
cutting off the trees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The latest vandalism by Jewish settlers came one day after
Palestinian peasants staged a protest at the area during which settlers
fired shots in the air to intimidate demonstrators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources stress that the seizure of Arab land
by Jewish settlers are taking a &igrave;plague proportions&icirc; with settlers
stealing Arab land on a daily basis while the Palestinian Authority, the
Arab world and much of the international community are busy with a dubious
peace process that is used by the Israeli government as a smoke screen to
hid or blure Jewish colonization in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>&quot;Mission Brutality&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Demolishing Arab homes in the occupied territories</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Demolition of Arab homes in the West Bank by the Israeli
occupation authorities has become a daily affair since Benyamin Netanyahu
came to power in Israel over a year ago. The brutal practice has become
so rampant that observers began to use labels such as &igrave;demographic
genocide&icirc; and &igrave;house massacres&icirc; to describe its wide-use
and devastating effect on Palestinian families.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In East Jerusalem, where the established but undelclared
Israeli policy is to throttle Arab population growth &igrave;by hook or
by crook,&icirc; the spectre of home demolition is haunting tens of thousands
of Jerusalemite Palestinians. On 15 August, the newly-made homeless families
decided to demonstrate their plight in the full view of the world public
opinion. Hence, they created a makeshift refugee camp they named &igrave;the
Jerusalem camp.&icirc; The camp, located at the Suwwana neighborhood, now
houses more than 30 Jerusalemite Arab families whose homes have been destoyed
by the Israeli occupation authorities and/or whose residency rights have
been withdrawn from them for reasons concocted by the Israeli interior ministry.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;The Israeli government is waging war on us, they
don&iacute;t want us here and they are using all kinds of cunning tactics
and legal tricks to get us to leave al Quds al Sfharif,&icirc; said Ahmed
Daoud, one of the victims of the Zionist ethnic-cleansing policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;If any country did something like this to the Jews,
there would be a clarion outcry in protest, but much of the world is just
silent, watching Israeli authorities implements this manifestly racist policy
against us,&icirc; an embittered Daoud added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to data recently released by Netanyahu&iacute;s
office, the Israeli army plans to destroy as many as 2000 Arab homes located
within area &igrave;C&icirc; which makes up about 80% of the total area
of the West Bank and covers all rural Palestinian areas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, Chief Palestinian negotiator Sa&iacute;eb Ureikat
placed the number of demolished Palestinian homes since Netanyahu came to
power at 385.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As usual, the occupation authorities claim the houses were
built without &igrave;proper permits&icirc; and are located on land needed
for bypass roads, settlement expansion, or in the vicinity of army camps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, it seems amply clear that the real motive behind
the planned destruction of Palestinian homes and the social, emotional and
economic devastation which befall affected families is first and foremost
to curtail, as much as possible, Arab population growth, particularly in
those parts of the West Bank where the Palestinians still have some space
for future expansion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, by stepping up this savagery, the current Israeli
government is in effect reverting to the ill-reputed policies of Yitzhak
Shamir, who sought to &igrave;narrow Palestinian horizons so much that they
would eventually be forced to leave their homeland for good.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Tactically, the demolition of Palestinians&iacute; homes
is primarily aimed at inflicting maximum emotional distressed pain on Arab
families. In addition to the building-without-permit excuse, the Israeli
army routinely resorts to the evil practice when a member of a Palestinian
family is involved, in fact or merely by suspicion, in acts of resistance
against the occupation. In some cases, throwing a stone at a passing Israeli
military vehicle, would be a sufficient ground for demolishing the perpetrator&iacute;s
home.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>House demolition is a particularly overwhelming experience
because of the symbolic status which Palestinians attach to their home.
To express extreme condemnation in Arabic, Palestinians say &igrave;Yikhrib
Beitak&icirc; may your home be destroyed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly, the Israeli occupation authorities have understood
this &igrave;weak point&icirc; in Palestinian social psychology and spared
no effort in utilizing it to the full. Hence, the policy of destroying residential
Arab homes was adopted immediately after the end of the 1967 war. Since
then, thousands of homes have been demolished, leaving indelible scars in
hearts and minds. In fact, the effects of such barbaric acts are incalculable,
especially on children of the affected families who are most prone to mental
distress. They are likely to suffer prolonged or permanent psychological
and emotional disorders for the rest of their life. It is not difficult
to imagine what goes through a child&iacute;s mind as he sees his home uprooted
and destroyed by a bulldozer driven by soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unmoved by such suffering, the Israeli army actually introduced
stringent restrictions on the rebuilding of destroyed homes. The situation
has become even more difficult for Palestinians during the Oslo process
if they live outside the boundaries of area &igrave;A,&icirc; the towns
and villages administered by Yaser Arafat&iacute;s Palestinian Authority,
which doesn&iacute;t exceed 2.5 per cent of the total area of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with the prospect of homelessness, many Palestinians,
especially young couples who have nowhere to live, often venture to build
a home without obtaining the precious building permit beforehand only for
Israeli bulldozers to move swiftly to destroy it. Many take the risk of
building without a permit because they are extremely difficult to obtain,
due to the Israeli policy of restricting to the bare minimum Palestinian
demographic expansion, the ultimate goal behind the home-demolition policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The manner in which a house is demolished is telling in
itself. The operation often begins by declaring the place where the doomed
house is located a closed military zone. Then , after soldiers have taken
position around the house, an officer would approach the head of family
to inform him that he has a two-hour grace period to get all belongings
and furniture out. Distraught family members would then rush to get some
of their valuables out. A crying wife would beg an apathetic army officer
to spare the home the family so laboriously built brick by brick and spend
all their life savings on, but to no avail, because &igrave;we are only
carrying out orders.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As the deadline approaches, an all hope of saving the home
fades, a child, returning from school and not knowing what is going on,
would make a last dash into the home before it becomes a pile of debris
in order to get his favourite toy or story-book. Then the deadline would
arrive and the commanding officer would order the family to move away. Soon
afterwards, explosives are attached to the house and detonated, the home
becomes rubble and &igrave;Mission Brutality&icirc; is executed.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Catholic Patriarch: Israel is spoiling religious
life in Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(3 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Catholic Patriarch of Jerusalem, Michael Sabbah, has
accused Israel of spoiling religious life and undermining religious freedom
in the holy city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking to journalists during a &igrave;face the press&icirc;
program in Ramallah on 2 September, the Patriarch said Israel was inhibiting
believers, including Christian clerics, from reaching holy places in East
Jerusalem and Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;We all witnessed how the Israeli occupation authorities
imposed a severe collective punishment on all Palestinians in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, denying pilgrims and believers access to holy places.
If this practice is to be repeated in the year 2000, it will seriously undermine
Christian celebrations of Christ&iacute;s 2000th birthday, &igrave; said
Sabbah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Sabbah contended that &igrave;given the current
circumstances, Jerusalem will not be ready for the paramount anniversary.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Jerusalem is open to all, but shut off in the face
of its Christian and Muslim sons and daughters,&icirc; added the Patriarch
with bitterness marking his tone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More to the point, Sabbah said that tit was unlikely that
the Pope of Rome would attend the celebrations in Jerusalem because the
&igrave;political situation in and around the city is not conducive to such
a visit.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sabbah, the highest-ranking Christian clergyman in the
Middle East, said the Holy See was following up the tense situation in the
Holy Land, particularly in Jerusalem, pointing out that Pope John Paul II
had sent letters of late to Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, urging them to revert to
the negotiation table.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, Sabbah denounced anew the sacrilegious posters
blaspheming the Prophet Muhammed and Virgin Mary, describing them as &igrave;dangerous
and reflecting a very worrying phenomenon throughout the Israeli Jewish
society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In June, an Israeli female settler pasted blasphemous drawings
on Arab shopfronts in Hebron, depicting the Prophet of Islam as a pig writing
the Quran.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sacrilegious act then sparked off widespread condemnations
throughout the Muslim world and, observers speculate, may have been the
chief motive behind the 31 July suicidal bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, an Israeli journal depicted the Virgin Mary as
a cow, prompting Muslim and Christian protests in several Palestinian towns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, the woman settler who pasted the blasphemous
caricature in Hebron, Tatiana Sussnik, has been freed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She never expressed remorse or even regret for what she
did.<BR>
