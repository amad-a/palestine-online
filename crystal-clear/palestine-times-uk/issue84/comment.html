<H3><CENTER>Grim Prognosis</CENTER></H3>

<P>One need not be a prophet of doom and gloom to testify to the virtual
death of the &quot;peace process&quot; between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Americans (the conspiring sponsor), the Israelis (the arrogant aggressor)
and Yasser Arafat (the vanquished supplicant) have all come to recognize
the demise and death of the peace process.</P>

<P>Indeed, Netanyahu, the megalomaniac Israeli leader who thinks he is the
greatest man on earth, left no doubts as to his prognosis of that process.
On 22 May, he told the diplomatic corps in Jerusalem that &quot;as far as
I'm concerned, the peace process died two years ago...even before I became
Prime Minister.&quot;</P>

<P>For its part, the American administration, the only remaining hope for
breathing life into the process, seems to be so terrified by the powerful
Jewish lobby in Washington, D.C. that the President of the United States
et al. will not dare to formally spell out the general outlines of the latest
talked-about American initiative, which was accepted by Arafat and utterly
rejected by Benyamin Netanyahu.</P>

<P>As to Yasser Arafat and those who gave him the benefit of the doubt,
it is now amply clear that the &quot;dream&quot; has turned into a nightmare,
a big nightmare. Needless to say, Arafat must have found by now, although
somewhat belatedly, that he has been cheated, betrayed and deceived by the
Americans and the Israelis alike, and also by some Arab leaders who encouraged
him to make the White House his ultimate Qibla (House of Worship).</P>

<P>But Arafat has only himself to blame. Indeed, it was a sign of utter
political na&iuml;vet&eacute; to capitalize on American &quot;evenhandedness.&quot;
America, after all, is par excellence the tormentor of the Palestinian People,
and Palestinians have never had &quot;a true friend at the White House,&quot;
as Arafat wantonly claimed on several occasions.</P>

<P>Moreover, Arafat has, probably willfully, heeded American-Israeli instructions
and dictates to persecute and repress a good many of his fellow-Palestinians
merely for speaking out against the Oslo sell-out. Very often, appeasing
the Americans and satiating Zionist thirst for Palestinian blood seemed
to be &quot;the policy&quot; that Arafat adopted in the vain hope that this
would make the Israelis relent and hand over more territory to him in the
West Bank.</P>

<P>Even now, as the moral and political bankruptcy of Arafat's policy becomes
manifestly clear, the Palestinian Authority is still incarcerating hundreds
of Islamist activists on no other account than pleasing the Americans in
order to qualify for a White House certificate of good conduct.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, Arafat has a long history of sacrificing the vital interests
of his people, thinking that this would at one point help the Palestinian
cause. Thus, he accepted the Hebron Agreement, which was &quot;a take it
or leave it offer&quot; solely structured to serve the security and economic
interests of the Israeli occupier at the expense of the Palestinians.</P>

<P>Furthermore, he lightly agreed to hold virtually all aspects of the Palestinians'
individual and collective lives hostage to Israeli security whims, an act
amounting to treachery.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding, Arafat, along with those Arab leaders who pushed him
to launch the &quot;peace offensive&quot; despite all considerations to
the contrary, are yet to awaken to the full consequences of their disastrous
miscalculations.</P>

<P>The Zionist leader Netanyahu has declared solemnly that the River Jordan
will always be Israel's eastern border, meaning that the Zionist State would
never allow the creation of a Palestinian State west of the river.</P>

<P>This is not rhetoric. The West Bank, the supposed home of Arafat's State-in-the-dream,
is now swarming with Jewish settlements so much so that very little room
is left for a viable or semi-viable Palestinian political entity. And as
for Jerusalem, which Arafat wishes (rather than hopes) to make the capital
of his would-be Palestinian State, it has been nearly completely Judaized
and encircled by settlements in every direction. Hence, it is unrealistic
to give any credence or credibility to Arafat's recent avowals that he will
formally declare the establishment of &quot;the Palestinian State&quot;
by 4 May 1999, when the interim phase is due to end.</P>

<P>Hence, in light of the imposing facts on the ground, it is completely
safe to label Arafat's proclamations as no more than &quot;rhetorical overindulgence,
wishful thinking and without substance.&quot;</P>

<P>This should bring us to the crucial question of &quot;what is next?&quot;
In order to answer this question honestly, one would have to obtain an accurate
prognosis of the state of affair in Palestine, the Arab-Muslim world and
the world at large. To begin with, one must come to terms with the fact
that it is already too late to achieve a real peaceful settlement between
Israel and the Palestinian people. The &quot;land-for-peace formula&quot;,
the essence of the peace process, has been rendered unworkable, to say the
least, for the simple reason that the &quot;land&quot;, e.g. the West Bank,
is no longer &quot;returnable&quot; to the Palestinians, given the new demography.</P>

<P>Moreover, it is highly unlikely that the United States or the EU countries
will go, at least in the foreseeable future, as far as pressuring Israel,
e.g. to &quot;comply with UN resolutions,&quot; for the former is virtually
in the Zionists' pockets and the latter are yet to recover from their enduring
&quot;guilty conscience&quot; vis-&agrave;-vis the Jews.</P>

<P>This leaves the Palestinians, the Arabs and Muslims, with one and only
one choice: Resistance in its various and multifaceted forms. A strategy
of resistance must rest on the conviction that Palestine in its entirety
is an Arab-Muslim land that was occupied by the Zionists by sheer military
force and that sooner or latter it will have to be recovered in full. No
one harbours any illusion about the long duration of this historical conflict
between Zionist invaders and Muslims. Likewise, no one should be deceived
into thinking that resistance would force the Zionists to capitulate in
a matter of a few years. The battle will be bloody, bitter and above all
long, and many generations will likely pass away before seeing Palestine
back where it eternally belongs.</P>
