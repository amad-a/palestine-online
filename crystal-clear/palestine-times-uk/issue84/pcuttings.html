<P>With an emphasis more on war than peace, Israel yesterday staged the
biggest military parade in Jerusalem for 25 years to celebrate the anniversary
of the capture of the Arab eastern half of the Holy City in 1967 and its
annexation... Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, who received
moral support from the presence of the US House Speaker, Newt Gingrich,
sparked a political storm by telling diplomats that the peace process had
&quot;collapsed&quot; two years ago, before he took office, after four Palestinian
suicide-bombs killed scores of Israelis, most in Jerusalem.</P>

<P>Hassan (A Lebanese of South of Lebanon) had no warning of his release.
After 12 years of imprisonment without trial at Al-Khiam jail in south Lebanon,
he was suddenly free to go..&quot;They would put a hood over my head and
I could hear one man hand-cranking a generator and another sprayed me with
water until I passed out. I was starved and denied sleep for three months.
Since then I have been beaten regularly, and they use psychological torture.
They told me again and again that they would kill my family. One prisoner
even had his sister brought in and they told him they would torture her,
too.&quot;</P>

<P>... In these two respects Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gingrich (Speaker of
the US House of Representatives) see eye to eye. &quot;Israel and the Republicans
will use the visit for their own ends but they are quite similar,&quot;
said a foreign ministry official. &quot;They both blame the Palestinians
for the stalled peace process. They both criticise the Clinton administration
for trying to pressure Israel into handing over land to the Palestinians.&quot;</P>

<P>In contrast to earlier tensions between Israel and the United States,
the current struggle to break a 15-month stalemate in the quest for an enduring
peace deal with the Palestinians highlights how the deep enmity between
a Democratic administration and a Republican-controlled Congress has shattered
the bipartisan consensus toward the Middle East. No Israeli prime minister
can afford to be indifferent to Israel's ties to the White House. But during
Netanyahu's U.S. trip last week, even members of his entourage were amazed
at the willingness of prominent members of Congress to denounce their own
government and express support for the leader of a foreign power that receives
$3 billion in U.S. aid each year.</P>

<P>Last June 10, the House (US Congress) focused attention on the sensitive
issue of Jerusalem--holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians--by voting 406-17
on a non-binding resolution endorsing an &quot;undivided&quot; Jerusalem
as Israel's capital and calling on Clinton to do the same. It was followed
with a House vote the next day to authorize $100 million to move the U.S.
Embassy to Jerusalem. The votes sparked violence in the Palestinian territories
and outrage throughout the Arab world. Gingrich's ( House Speaker Newt Gingrich)
plan to visit the site and declare his support for the Embassy transfer
could magnify the frustrations among Palestinians over the deadlock in peace
negotiations. Still, informed of Erekat's warning Wednesday, a spokesman
for Gingrich in Washington reiterated the Speaker's intention to go to the
site to declare his support for the move.</P>

<P>Last week, the Commission (EU) formally warned Israel it would act to
stop imports from the occupied territories which benefit from trade privileges
granted to Israel. It said the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza, in east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights were &quot;not part of the
state of Israel&quot;, adding that goods exported to the EU should not benefit
from preferential treatment under the EU's trade agreement with Israel.
The Commission said that it had not referred to sanctions or a boycott in
discussions with Israel.</P>
