<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israeli torment of Palestinians continues <br>
despite renewed contacts with PA</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Israel remembered &#147;the holocaust&#148; and celebrated
&#147;independence day,&#148; her army continued to torment Palestinian civilians in a
sustained effort to crush their seven-month uprising against Israel&#146;s 34-year
military occupation and to force them into submission.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, and despite renewed security talks between the two sides, the
killing of Palestinians, the destruction and demolition of their homes and the
pulverization of their farms continued unabated, as the intifada is about to enter its
eighth month, without showing signs of waning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In April, the Israeli army murdered at least 25 Palestinians, including
six children, four male adolescents and a Palestinian security officer who died after one
week of wounds he sustained during heavy Israeli bombardment of Khan Younis in the central
Gaza Strip. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a particularly grisly incident on Wednesday, 25 April, Israeli
occupation troops detonated a land-mine planted near the Salahuddin Gate in Rafah, at the
southern tip of the Gaza Strip, killing four Palestinian civilians and injuring six, two
of them seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources described the killing as a &#147;premeditated
massacre.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>This is not death in a cross-fire; this is not criminal
negligence; this is cold-blooded murder perpetrated with malice aforethought,&#148; said a
Palestinian spokesman in reference to the incident.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the children murdered by the Neo-Nazis were two who were gunned down
while returning home from school.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One child from Rafah was killed by an Israeli army sniper while returning
from a math lesson at his teacher&#146;s home not far from his own, having been unable to
attend school due to continual Israeli strafing of the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the blood-letting, the Israeli army kept up its incursions
into PA-controlled territories, particularly in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, unlike the brief reoccupation of a Palestinian position in
northern Gaza during mid-April, which then drew strong international (including American)
criticisms, forcing a prompt Israeli withdrawal, the occupation army is now adopting a
slightly different tactic, based on the formula &#147;go, destroy, and leave.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This way, the Israeli political leadership hopes tactical goals can be
achieved without inviting a strong international reaction. Indeed, this seems to be
working to some extent, especially in the southern part of the Gaza Strip where Israeli
troops entered PA-controlled territory twice during the last week of April, destroyed
Palestinian security installations and withdrew immediately afterwards.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the occupation army continued to carry out intermittent blanket
bombardments of Palestinian population centres in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During
the last week in April, an entire Palestinian family in Hebron narrowly escaped what could
have been a terrible massacre.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli tanks and artillery reportedly bombarded residential homes
throughout the town, home to 170,000 Palestinians, with one shell landing on the veranda
of the Abedeen family, ravaging their home and injuring everybody in the house.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>It was a miracle, a real miracle, that we were not killed.
This is the real terror carried out by true terrorists,&#148; said Ibrahim Abedeen, who
was injured by shrapnel along with his wife and six children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bethlehem, Jericho and much of the Gaza Strip also came under heavy
bombardment from Israeli tanks in which numerous houses were partially damaged or
completely destroyed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army routinely claims that the often ferocious bombardment is
in reaction to Palestinian firing toward Jewish settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, an objective examination of the situation on the ground reveals
the utter falsehood of the Israeli claim.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Whenever they hear a gunshot sound, even if it is 10
kilometres away, they immediately start bombarding us with tanks, artillery and heavy
machine-guns,&#148; said Mustafa Abdul Nabi Natshe of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He adds, with frustration clear in the tone of his voice, that &#147;their
real aim is not to protect the settlers, but rather to kill the Palestinians and drive
them away.&#148;</p>
<b><i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></i><u>Frustration fuels determination</u></b><br>
This frustration, or collective powder keg, is not driving Palestinians away from their
towns and villages, but is rather pushing at least some of them to carry out more attacks
against Israelis and in the heart of Israel itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday, 22 April, a 17-year-old Palestinian schoolboy detonated
explosives strapped to his waist near an Israeli bus in the Israeli Jewish town of
K&#146;far Saba, 15 miles north of Tel Aviv, killing himself, an Israeli man, and injuring
scores of other Israelis&#150;civilians and soldiers alike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following day, a car-bomb blast injured four Israelis in what the
Israeli police described as a &#147;terrorist act.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas took responsibility for the first blast while the small military
wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) took credit for the
second.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The car-bomb attacks inside the Jewish State are likely to continue and
even increase as the Israeli army continues to narrow Palestinian horizons further and
further, all for the purpose of forcing the leadership to accept the <i>fait accompli</i>
as decided and defined by Ariel Sharon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Sharon government, staffed with the most hawkish of the
hawks in the Jewish State, seems to be hell-bent on tampering with the extremely sensitive
issue of Haram al-Sharif of Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, 20 April, scores of Israeli policemen armed with assault rifles
mounted a show of force at the esplanade of the Islamic shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials claimed the provocative measure was directed against
&#147;stone throwers.&#148; However, Palestinian waqf officials charged, with some
justification, that the Israelis were only trying to test the limits of Muslim
forbearance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, the right-wing Israeli President Moshe Katsav
&#147;suggested&#148; that Jews and Muslims &#147;share&#148; the Haram al-Sharif
compound.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Using a characteristically sly language, Katsav asked, &#147;Why
can&#146;t there be arrangements at the Haram al-Sharif similar to those at the Ibrahimi
Mosque in Hebron?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What Katsav failed to mention is the fact that the usurpation of the
&#147;partitioning&#148; of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was carried out unilaterally by
the Israeli army and neither the Palestinians nor Muslims at large ever accepted the
effective Jewish take-over of the Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haram al-Sharif is considered one of the most sacred holy places in
Islam, and Muslim officials have repeatedly warned that any Jewish encroachment on the
holy site would spark an inextinguishable fire throughout the Middle East that no
government would be able to put out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is unlikely though that Muslim warnings will deter Israeli extremists,
who enjoy almost total support and backing from the Sharon government and the official
Jewish establishment, from proceeding with their ominous designs against the Islamic
shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This means that the chances for a showdown are increasingly building up
and menacingly moving toward a climax, one that many politicians dread even to imagine. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Rantisi: Hamas will continue mortar and other
operations</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza </b>- Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi, a prominent leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement, Hamas, in the Gaza Strip, has affirmed that Hamas would continue
firing mortar shells in addition to launching martyrdom operations for the sake of
liberating Palestine regardless of circumstances.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Responding to news on Palestinian Authority chairman&#146;s orders to ban
firing mortar shells, he said, &#147;We are an Islamic resistance movement and our option
is resistance. We have realized since the Madrid conference that our sole option for
liberation was struggle, and our option has proven successful. Everybody now knows that
any other option was a failure and that negotiations bore no fruit except more suffering
for our people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rantisi wondered, &#147;If the mortar shells, as some like to publicize,
did not bring about any benefit, why then are the Zionists panicking and America is
pressuring to stop them? It is a very serious contradiction because the enemy is screaming
as a result of the use of the shells&#133;yes, maybe the casualties are very few, but they
forced the enemy to take refuge in shelters for many days.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hamas official explained that the mortar was the strongest deterrent
weapon now available even though it inflicted few casualties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked what would happen if the PA security bodies intercepted Hamas
commando units launching mortar shells, he said, &#147;We will not be dragged into a civil
war, and we will continue resistance,&#148; but he stressed, &#147;We will use any
available means to fight occupation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, a Zionist army report yesterday revealed that the Palestinian
fighters had fired more than 100 mortar shells at Zionist targets since the start of this
year, according to AFP.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report said that one shell was fired in January, nine in February, 13
in March and 80 in April.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report noted that all mortar shells were fired from the Gaza Strip and
targeted military positions, settlements and towns within the entity.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Jewish Nazism flaunts itself in Hebron </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron &#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian civilians in this Arab town of 180,000 are forced to fight a
daily battle for survival against bands of virulently racist, Messianic Jewish settlers
protected by thousands of often trigger-happy Israeli occupation soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians and many Israelis routinely label the settlers &#147;Jewish
Nazis,&#148; to underscore their brash racism against everybody and everything that is not
Jewish.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is striking though is that many settlers in Hebron don&#146;t feel
offended by the term which some of them at least see as connoting the &#147;fear and
terror&#148; which Jews ought to cast in the hearts of their enemies, in this case the
Palestinians.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Some of our tactics might be described as Nazi,&#148; said
Daniel Rider, a spokesman for the estimated 250-300 Jewish settlers in Hebron, but not
without adding that &#147;unlike German Nazism, our Nazism is ordained by God.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rider, who immigrated from New York to Israel 20 years ago, continues,
&#147;using harsh methods against one&#146;s enemies is something commended in
Judaism.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The Torah teaches us that we should have no mercy with the
enemy; the concept of human rights in Judaism is entirely different from the same concept
in Western liberal traditions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron, as elsewhere in the West Bank, the racism of the settlers is
translated every day into blatant provocation against Palestinians and flagrant vandalism
against their property.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 26 April, for example, a band of settlers, including children and
women, attacked a Palestinian family with stones and iron bars outside the small
settlement of Kharsina, on Hebron&#146;s northern suburbs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers shouted at the Arab family, &#147;Get out of here&#133;go
away; this is a Jewish house.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, as members of the Palestinian family sought to defend themselves
against the obviously rabid settlers, Israeli army soldiers watching from a fair distance
started firing machine-guns at the Palestinian house.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few minutes later, many soldiers arrived at the scene to arrest the
Palestinians for &#147;disturbing security&#148; and for &#147;attacking Israeli
citizens.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers, gleeful and content, returned to the Jewish enclave in the
old town, apparently to plan another expedition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similarly, on Tuesday, 25 April, the settlers asked a Jewish woman to hurl
stones at a group of Palestinians who were standing peaceably outside their stores, not
far from the Ibrahimi Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And as always, and according to plan, the Palestinians try to stop the
woman; the woman becomes even more rabid; then the soldiers arrive, beat up the Arabs, and
declare the area a &#147;closed military zone.&#148; Mission accomplished.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the Hebron settlers belong to the fascist Jewish movement known as
Gush Emunim, which combines nationalism and religion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The movement, represented in the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, by seven
MPs, believes that &#147;all goyem (a derogatory Hebrew word for non-Jews which literally
means beasts or animals) ought to be massacred, expelled or enslaved by the Jews.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This virulent ideology is not confined to the theoretical sphere. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 25 February, 1994, a member of Gush Emunim, a doctor named Baruch
Goldstein, murdered 29 Palestinians while they were praying at dawn at the Ibrahimi
Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers praised the carnage and sought to immortalize the murderer,
who was subsequently killed by Palestinian survivors, by building a memorial for him in
Kiryat Arba&#146;a.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The place became a pilgrimage site for Jews from San Francisco to
Canberra, who come in throngs to be blessed by the grave of the &#147;great Jewish saint
and martyr.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, while Goldstein&#146;s body is no longer around, his ideas, ideals
and way of thinking are still very much alive among the settlers and their supporters, not
only in Hebron but throughout Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, one wouldn&#146;t overstate the fact by saying that virulent
racism is today more rampant and more rooted among Jewish settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last March, Israeli settlers detonated explosives attached to a large gas
canister that demolished an Arab building.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrorist act was reportedly perpetrated in full view of Israeli
occupation soldiers, who made no efforts to stop the settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The soldiers&#146; connivance with the settlers, an established reality,
only gives credence to the Palestinian assertion that the &#147;snake wouldn&#146;t bite
its tail.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources as well as foreign observers from the
Temporary International Presence in Hebron or TIPH, the real goal of the settlers is to
drive away the estimated 34,000 Palestinians living in the old town so that the settlers
might be able to build an all-Jewish town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the Israeli army, which often acts towards the Palestinians like the
Nazi police (the Gestapo) did toward Jews in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, does all it
can to expedite the silent expulsion of the Palestinians from one of the most ancient Arab
towns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To achieve the sinister goal, the army adopts a combination of
psychological and economic measures to torment the Palestinians, all designed to make life
(Arab life) in the old town unbearable, so much so that the Palestinians would leave.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising nearly seven
months ago, the Palestinians (not the settlers) have been under an intermittent
debilitating curfew which forces men, women and children to stay indoors, occasionally for
days and weeks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The suffocating and psychologically tormenting curfews are interrupted by
a respite lasting for one or two hours a week to enable the decimated Palestinians to buy
food which many of them can&#146;t afford to buy, given the town&#146;s destroyed economy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The situation in Hebron has now become even worse, even much worse, with
the almost daily bombardment of Palestinian residential areas by Israeli tanks and gunners
and the mounting casualties sustained consequently.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, an Israeli tank shell landed on the home of Muhammed Abedin,
damaging it beyond repair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Luckily, this time a massacre was averted, and the family of seven
sustained only moderate to medium injuries by the flying shrapnel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers, interestingly, welcome the rising violence. They think it
will accelerate the coming of the Messiah.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Palestinian scholars reject Saudi Mufti&#146;s <br>
view on martyrdom operations</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- Muslim ulema or religious scholars in Palestine
have disputed a view by the Mufti of Saudi Arabia expressing reservations about the
&#147;the compatibility of martyrdom operations with Islamic tenets.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Saudi mufti, Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdullah al-Sheikh was reported as saying
that &#147;as far as I know, these operations are not validated by the shariah (the Muslim
code of Islamic law).&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>It depends on how the question was worded to him; the man is
not well acquainted with the Palestinian situation,&#148; said Mustafa Shawar, an Islamic
scholar in Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that there was a fundamental difference between
&#147;suicide&#148; and martyrdom.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Suicide is the result of hopelessness and despair; it is
something psychological; while martyrdom is a wish to sacrifice one&#146;s soul for a
noble cause for the sake of God,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For his part, the famous Egyptian religious scholar and propagator Dr.
Yousef al-Qaradawi said that the martyrdom operations were not suicide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He emphasized that such operations in the light of the present
circumstances were a religious duty on all those capable of performing them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qaradawi called on the youth in Palestine to launch martyrdom operations
without any hesitation as long as they were the only means available to launch Jihad and
to offer one&#146;s life for the sake of raising high one&#146;s religion and Nation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dr. Hamdi Murad, professor of Islamic Shariah at the Jordanian Balqa&#146;
University said that the martyrdom operations were considered Jihad for the sake of Allah
as long as they were serving right and deterring oppression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He affirmed that such operations were the highest degree of sacrifice,
adding, &#147;we might resort to martyrdom operations if the results of which proved to be
better than other methods and if the enemy was better equipped and militarily superior to
us.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>All means are legitimate for the sake of ending oppression,
including the infliction of losses in the ranks of the enemy, which would include
martyrdom operations, especially when other means failed to end the aggression,&#148; he
elaborated.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We hail such operations when they serve as a deterrent to
that arrogant enemy and in the absence of other weapons,&#148; the professor pointed out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Israel&#146;s Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Yisrael Meir Israel Lau has
condemned Muslim ulema or religious scholars for supporting martyrdom operations against
Israeli targets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lau made his remarks at a K&#146;far Saba hospital last month where he
visited several Israeli civilians and soldiers injured in a martyrdom operation in
K&#146;far Sava on 22 April. One Jewish settler was killed and scores of others injured in
the incident, along with the Palestinian martyr who carried out the attack.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>There is nothing more repugnant than telling young people
that they will go to heaven if they die fighting Jews,&#148; Lau, who holds extremely
racist attitudes against non-Jews in general and Palestinians in particular, was quoted as
saying.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lau suggested that Palestinians shouldn&#146;t resist Jewish oppressors
&#147;because the latter happen to be God&#146;s chosen people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A Muslim scholar from the Hebron area retorted saying, &#147;The moment
the rabbi stops viewing non-Jews as sheep and goats in human form to be slaughtered and
enslaved, Muslims will reconsider their views&#133;we are waiting to see if he will.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last March, Lau tacitly approved virulently racist statements by Shas
mentor Ovadia Yosef in which Yosef, a former chief rabbi, called for the extermination of
all Arabs whom he referred to as &#147;an evil race.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yosef&#146;s remarks were not widely condemned by Jewish religious leaders
or even by the Israeli political establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some Israeli officials described the remarks as &#147;bad public
relations,&#148; but not racist.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lau and the other chief rabbi representing Sephardi Jews (Jews originating
in the Middle East) have refused to denounce the genocidal actions of the Israeli
occupation troops against Palestinians, including the uprooting of vast tracts of
Palestinian trees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Torah makes explicit injunctions against uprooting trees, which
suggests that the rabbis place political expediency first and religious idealism second. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 2 April, settler terror took a turn for the worse when seemingly armed
rabid settlers, in full view of Israeli soldiers, brought in and detonated a huge gas
canister attached to a highly explosive substance inside a Palestinian-owned business in
the Sahla neighbourhood, not far from the Ibrahimi Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The powerful blast rocked Hebron, utterly destroying the Palestinian store
and irreparably damaging a three-storey building.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers proved that they were thieves besides being terrorists, as
they looted all the merchandise at the store and other businesses in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, as always, none of the perpetrators were arrested, a message
construed by the settlers as a tacit approval from the army and the Sharon government to
carry out further acts of terror and vandalism against Palestinians with impunity, of
course. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the Israeli army, instead of arresting the terrorists,
turned to public relations and misinformation in order to extenuate the damage done to
Israel&#146;s image.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An army spokesman claimed it was investigating &#147;whether or not the
Jews were involved in the incident,&#148; a carefully concocted statement that is
apparently designed to cloud settler crimes and deceive international public opinion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are close to 3,000 Israeli troops stationed in the old town of
Hebron, whose total area does not exceed 1 square kilometre, and it would be highly
unlikely that the settlers could do what they have been doing without being observed by
the soldiers.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>It is impossible for a rat to move in the old town without
being observed by the Israeli army,&#148; said one Palestinian, scoffing at the
army&#146;s claim that it didn&#146;t see the settlers embark on their crime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, and after deliberate postponement lasting for five days, the
parents of a Jewish settler toddler, who was accidentally killed in late March during an
exchange of fire between Israeli occupation troops and Palestinian resistance fighters,
agreed to bury their daughter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The parents and fellow settlers had vowed not to bury the little child
until the Israeli army &#147;re-conquers or bombs-out&#148; the Abu Sneineh neighbourhood,
from which the settlers alleged the shot that killed the baby was fired.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Chief
Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, sought to convince the settlers to bury the child quickly in
accordance with Jewish traditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to an Israeli journalist covering the funeral, the Israeli army
commander in Hebron, Arnon Shimon, sought to comfort the bereaved family by telling them,
&#147;We have killed ten Arab children for your daughter.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mother of the toddler reportedly said, &#147;No! ten is not enough; I
want a thousand Arab children killed for my daughter; all Arabs are not worth a Jew&#146;s
fingernail.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis actually killed 12 rather than 10 Palestinians in five days,
including 11-year-old Mahmoud Darawish, who was riddled with bullets on 27 March, a few
hours after the settler child was killed, while sitting in his living room watching
television in Dura, 12 kilometres south-west of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli media, including the State-run radio, made no mention of
Darawish, or Lauay Tamimi, another 11-year-old Palestinian child who died on 1 April of
wounds inflicted earlier by an Israeli army sniper near Ramallah. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, the burial of the child received unusually ample coverage by
the Israeli media and the Zionist-influenced American television networks which normally
barely give any attention to the even more tragic Palestinian deaths wrought by Israeli
soldiers and settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Seeking to exploit the tragic death, the Israeli foreign ministry even
instructed Israeli diplomatic representatives around the world to highlight the incident
and manipulate it to the hilt in order to besmirch the Palestinians&#146; image.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The right-wing Israeli paper, the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, went as far as
describing the incident as &#147;a little holocaust.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similar corrupt analogies and hyperbolic labels were also made by Israeli
commentators, not only in Israel but in North America, where the Israeli government
recently began a huge public relations blitz aimed at enhancing Israel&#146;s image.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government and media maintained that the incident was
deliberate, and that a Palestinian sharpshooter deliberately targeted the baby, a claim
that seems to have not an iota of credibility.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, a report by the Jewish human rights group &#147;Gush
Shalom,&#148; released on 1 April, stated that &#147;there is not the slightest shred of
evidence suggesting that the killing of the child was done on purpose.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the death of the settler, the Israeli army has been intermittently
bombarding Palestinian neighbourhoods on a daily basis, using artillery and heavy
machine-guns, and inflicting widespread havoc and destruction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the buildings directly hit was a clinic at the Abu Sneineh
neighbourhood, an indisputable fact belying Israeli army claims that it only fires at
&#147;terrorist targets.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdul Nabi Natshe, over 2,000 buildings
in Hebron have been hit and damaged by Israeli artillery bombardment since the Palestinian
intifada erupted more than six months ago.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Their aim is to inflict as much destruction as possible; they
just want to prove to us that they are the powerful party and that we should come to terms
with this reality.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the incident, the Zionist army brought in to Hebron three tanks
and directed its large guns toward Palestinian neighbourhoods. The tanks were not for
show, for as soon as the Jewish child was buried, the tanks fired salvos of artillery and
machine-guns at the Abu Sneineh and Takruri neighbourhoods.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are 250-300 Jewish settlers living in Hebron&#146;s Old Town among
the local Palestinian inhabitants totalling 170,000.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers belong to the Gush Emunim movement, which believes that all
non-Jews ought to be expelled from &#147;the Biblical Land of Israel&#148;&#133;and if
they refuse, then they ought to be massacred.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 2 April, Uri Avnery, one of the last remaining voices of moderation and
common sense in Israel, called on the Sharon government to remove the settlers from
Hebron.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Hebron is a Palestinian town,&#148; Avnery wrote, &#147;and
the only way to maintain peace and stability in the city is by removing the settlers from
it, once and for all.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, as expected, Avnery&#146;s words fell on deaf ears.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The Jewish presence in Hebron will remain forever,&#148;
retorted Sharon. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Open Letter to Crown-Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdulaziz</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your Highness: Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After some hesitation, I&#146;ve decided to write to you publicly about
the Palestinian plight and the shocking failure of the Arab-Muslim Umma (community) to
offer real tangible support for the struggling Palestinian people against Jewish-Zionist
terror.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I won&#146;t elaborate in describing the dire situation in Palestine and
the real genocide the Jews are carrying out against Palestinian men, women and children
whose &#147;crime&#148; is their desire to be free from Jewish colonialism and occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, the gruesome atrocities we are facing, the wanton
destruction of property, the suffocating siege, the sinister torment are all too real to
be described in words. Indeed, whatever finds its way to the screens of Arab and foreign
televisions communicates only a small part of the reality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, we are facing a real genocide, a holocaust in the making, which
often transcends reality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness: the Palestinian people, with God&#146;s help, are still
steadfast and resisting the barbarian Jews with whatever meagre tools are at their
disposal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But that steadfastness is not without a price, and its continuity
can&#146;t be guaranteed without truly active Arab-Muslim support, which, unfortunately,
hasn&#146;t been forthcoming.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, the price we have been paying for the last seven months is,
as always, in blood, the blood of our children, whom the criminal Zionist barbarians
target in order to destroy us psychologically.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, the barbarians deliberately and intentionally target our kids, who
might be playing in their backyards, walking in the street, or returning home from school,
in order to make us depressed and break us from within, all for the purpose of defeating
us and forcing us to surrender.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in addition to murdering nearly 500 innocent civilians so far&#150;a
third of whom are children below the age of 14&#150;the barbarians effectively destroyed
our fields, burned our trees and demolished many of our homes. They ravaged our economy so
much so that mere survival has become our sole preoccupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, the barbarians are doing to us what the Nazis had done to them,
although we are innocent of any crimes against them save our desire to be free from their
terror and domination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, this overwhelming terror is leaving a devastating effect on
all of us, including our children who ask bitterly and helplessly, &#147;Why are we alone?
Where are our Arab brothers? Where are our Muslim brothers? Why don&#146;t they come to
our aid?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a Muslim talking to a Muslim, I believe it is imperative to remind your
highness of the saying of our Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) that &#147;a Muslim is
brother to his fellow Muslim; he mustn&#146;t betray him, he mustn&#146;t deliver him into
the hands of the enemy.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, your highness, the Muslim world is effectively delivering us into the
hands of the barbarian Zionist Jews to kill us, demolish our homes, burn our fields,
desecrate our mosques and, yes, destroy al-Masjidul Aqsa, the first Qibla of Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, we know that Arab and Muslim States have held several meetings in
which they decided to offer the Palestinians some money. And we know of the many other
decisions and empty rhetoric which can only enforce a feeling of helplessness and
impotence in the ranks of the umma.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, what the Palestinian people and the Aqsa Mosque badly need
these days is concrete political action, not money.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And we truly believe that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as indeed the rest
of the Arab and Muslim States, is capable of delivering that kind of support if and when
there is the political will on the part of officials in the Kingdom.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You know, your highness, that the terrorist and war criminal Sharon
wouldn&#146;t be doing what he is doing to the Palestinians as I write these words were it
not for the unlimited and unconditional military, political and economic support Criminal
Israel is receiving from the United States. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is the American support, connivance, encouragement and protection that
feed Zionist insolence, murder and aggression. America, your highness, is the ultimate
tormentor of the Palestinian people; it is our executive killer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, the Aqsa Mosque is in danger; the Jews are only waiting for
the opportune time to destroy it and make it a thing of the past, and the stream of our
children&#146;s blood is flowing, even overflowing, while the Americans are brashly flying
in our faces by shielding the Zionist entity with their veto power and by refusing to
allow the deployment of international observers in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, the U.S.&#150;Israel&#146;s ally&#150;needs Saudi Arabia
more than Saudi Arabia needs the United States. The planes, the cars and the merchandise
you purchase from the U.S. can always be purchased from other countries that are less
hostile to Muslims and their just causes. And your oil can be sold elsewhere if the
Americans stop buying Saudi oil. In the final analysis, &#147;the noble woman would rather
starve than breast-feed for money!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, in the name of the bereaved mothers, in the name of the murdered
children whose tender bodies were riddled with Zionist bullets, in the name of Muhammed
Durra and Faris Oudeh, and the other 100 children murdered by the disciples of Hiter, we
call on you, we appeal to you, we implore you to reconsider Saudi ties with the United
States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your highness, the Palestinian people are appealing to you to tell the
Americans that they can&#146;t have it both ways: enable Israel to kill us and at the same
time continue to enjoy the benefits of its strategic and economic relations with the
Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Please, tarry not in protecting the honour of the umma.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">May God give you strength to do what is right.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon to create more &#147;facts&#148; in the
West Bank </font></h3>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem- </strong><b>From Khalid Amayreh</b><br>
Despite claims to the contrary, the Sharon government has apparently endorsed plans to
create at least one large Jewish settlement south of Jerusalem and significantly expand a
number of existing settlements throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Hebrew press, the Israeli housing ministry has already
prepared plans for building a new Jewish settlement that would include 6,000 flats in an
area located between Bethlehem and Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new settlement, to be called Giva&#146;ot, would be inhabited by Jews
from the &#147;national-religious camp,&#148; considered to be among the most racist and
anti-Arab of Jews anywhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If built, the new settlement would further truncate the southern part of
the West Bank, bisecting it into two main enclaves cut off from each other and lacking
territorial continuity with the Ramallah region in the central West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the planned settlement, a Jerusalem municipal committee has
approved new plans to build another 3,000 apartments on confiscated Arab land at Jabal Abu
Ghneim (Har Homa).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The governments of Benyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak had already
constructed hundreds of settler units at Jabal Abu Ghneim on Jerusalem&#146;s southern
suburbs, apparently in order to complete the chain of Jewish settlements around occupied
East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The political aim of this settlement is clear, namely to render impossible
the return of land to the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the grabbing of Palestinian land by armed Jewish settlers
continued unabated throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources reported earlier this month that Jewish settlers were
seizing land in the vicinity of their settlements throughout the West Bank, cordoning it
off with barbed wire, all with the Israeli army&#146;s tacit approval.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron, for example, the Israeli army confiscated a large expanse of
Palestinian farmland adjacent to the former armistice line of 1967.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The owners of the land, peasants from the nearby village of Beit Kahel,
organized a sit-in on the land on 26 March to protest the illegal seizure. However,
Israeli soldiers stationed at the site threatened to shoot the villagers if they
didn&#146;t disperse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli army bulldozers were similarly busy this week pulverizing
Palestinian vineyards and olive groves south of the town of Dura, 10 miles south-west of
Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There the Israeli army is opening another bypass road that would link the
tiny settlement of Otnael, inhabited by no more than 30 settler families, with inter-city
roads in southern Israel more than 15 miles away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The opening of the road, and the accompanying brutality of destroying
Palestinian fields on which villagers depend for their livelihood, underscores the brutal
ugliness of the Zionist mentality and the extent to which the Sharon regime is willing to
go to torment the Palestinians for the sake of guaranteeing the welfare of a handful of
settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And as the expansion of settlements continues, so do the often murderous
attacks of Jewish settlers against Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied
territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 March, the bludgeoned body of 44-year-old Jabri Abu Ras of Dura was
found dumped outside the Jewish settlement of Halmish north of Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian hospital sources in Ramallah said Abu Ras was shot several
times in the chest and head before his skull was crushed by stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His relatives affirmed that they had no doubt whatsoever that the settlers
committed the gruesome crime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two weeks ago, settlers from the settlement of Navi Yaccoub north of
Jerusalem reportedly murdered a 10-year-old Palestinian child who was playing soccer near
the settlement, using very much the same gruesome method of murder.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In both cases, the Israeli occupation authorities made no arrests among
the settlers nor even launched an investigation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, far from investigating the two murders, an Israeli police
spokesman even sought to divert attention from the true culprits, claiming that the
Palestinian Authority was behind the murders, an incredible claim scoffed at by
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from their murderous attacks, which have come lately to assume a
daily frequency, the settlers continued to carry out wanton acts of vandalism against
Palestinian civilians often in the full view of Israeli army soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a recent report, the Israeli human rights group B&#146;Tselem accused
the Israeli army of tolerating and tacitly encouraging settler violence against innocent
and unprotected Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report stressed that the settlers&#146; often wanton violence and
vandalism against Palestinians and their property occur against a background of leniency
and prolonged impotence of the Israeli law-enforcement authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the report, the settlers&#146; violence took many forms,
including firing at Palestinian civilian neighbourhoods, killing and wounding Palestinian
civilians, firing and throwing stones at Palestinian cars, damaging property, uprooting
trees, burning a mosque, harming Palestinian medical teams, attacking journalists and
preventing farmers from reaching their fields.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report mentioned two telling facts, which are known all too well to
the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the fact that Israeli soldiers and police officers are often
present when settlers attack Palestinians but do absolutely nothing to stop or prevent the
attacks. Indeed, in many cases, the report said, the soldiers respond
&#147;derisively&#148; to Palestinian appeals for assistance against settler violence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, and that is extremely significant, the fact that settler violence
against the Palestinians is very often not investigated, with two thirds of the cases
being closed, ostensibly due to &#147;lack of interest.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron, the rampaging violence and terror by Jewish settlers against
Palestinians and their property reached unprecedented gravity when settlers looted,
torched and blew up as many as 35 Palestinian businesses and stores.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most, if not all, of the rampage is perpetrated in collusion with the
Israeli army, which does next to nothing to arrest the settlers who are treated as
&#147;above the law.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The plague of Jewish settlers is not confined to physical violence and
wanton rampage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 26 March, as much as 3.5 million cubic metres of partially treated
sewage waters originating at the Jewish settlement of Nahal Oz, east of Gaza, deluged
several Arab neighbourhoods in Gaza City, causing a huge environmental disaster.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The huge torrent occurred when an Israeli water storage facility at the
settlement broke down (or was deliberately broken), inundating much of the Shujaiya
neighbourhood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The flood reportedly caused incalculable damage to houses as well as to
farmland and livestock in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian officials put the damage and losses incurred at tens of
millions of dollars.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Palestinian official remarked on the incident, saying that the Jews
have introduced a new weapon against us </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">PA admits inability to end intifada </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>A high-ranking Palestinian Authority official
admitted on 14 April that the PA was not able to put an end to the nearly seven-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli military occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Gaza branch of the Preventive Security Force,
told the Zionist State-run radio that &#147;ending the intifada is not a simple
task&#133;we have to offer the people something in return.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan pointed out that the Zionist regime seriously undermined his
organization&#146;s ability to carry out its function, adding that the &#147;the matter is
not one of willingness but of ability as well.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan said Palestinian security agencies would resume the task of
restoring calm once the Israeli occupation army removed its troops from Palestinian
territories and stopped its aggression.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Israel,&#148; he said, &#147;killed security coordination
between PA and security agencies.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA official also described security meetings between Israeli and
Palestinian officials, which are held under CIA supervision, as &#147;futile.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, the Zionist paper <i>Hatsofae</i> (mouthpiece of the Jewish
religious/fascist party known as Mifdal) reported that the CIA was eavesdropping on
Palestinian officials telephones, including those of Dahlan, and forwarding the content to
Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources intimated that Dahlan hardened his posture <i>vis-�-vis</i>
security coordination with the Zionists after his motorcade came under fire from Zionist
troops near the Beit Hanun crossing last month.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan had also said that the security coordination with the Israelis was
&#147;ordered from above,&#148; in reference to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other statements, Hindi claimed that any decision passed by the PA
National Security Council, such as barring the firing of mortar shells, primarily targeted
the people and the country&#146;s higher interests.</p>

expected to meet soon with PA officials.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- An orthodox Jewish group dedicated to the
destruction of Islamic and Christian holy places in Jerusalem and the rest of Palestine
has labelled Muslims as &#147;pagans.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The outrageously blatant label appeared in a leaflet distributed on the
internet by the &#147;Temple Mount Faithful,&#148; a Jewish Messianic group intent on
destroying the Aqsa Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The leaflet, written by the group&#146;s head, Girshon Solomon, suggested
that Israel should exterminate the Palestinian people in the same manner that Joshua Ben
Nun did at Jericho, 3,300 years ago.</p>

to death all Cannanite men, women and children, as well as their animals and their

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Together with the help of the brave and visionary Israeli

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islam is considered the most monotheistic of all the three monotheistic
religions, given that Shirk or associating gods with God is considered in Islam as the
greatest of all sins.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to &#147;remove the foreigners, their pagan shrines
and their abomination of the holy hill of God and to rebuild the Third Temple, the task
for which he was chosen by a great majority of the Israeli nation.&#148;</p>

Messiah named &#147;Mashih Ben David&#148; was about to appear to bring about
