<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Mossad's fiasco and the release of Sheikh
Yassin</FONT></H3>

<P>	<FONT SIZE=+1>It was no coincidence nor change of heart that led to
the Israeli release on 1 October 1997 of the founder of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, from a life imprisonment sentence passed down by an Israeli court
in 1989. And it is not a surprise that tens of thousands of Palestinians
turned out to welcome Sheikh Yassin's heroic return to Gaza after he received
treatment in a Jordanian hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	What actually led to Sheikh Yassin's release can be traced
to two main factors: (1) the Israelis fear that the quadriplegic, who is
not only the founder of Hamas but a charismatic symbol to the Palestinians
as well, would die in prison (since his health had been slowing deteriorating)
and thus become not only a greater exemplification of the Palestinian struggle
but also a martyr, and martyrdom could ignite a situation that might not
be possible to keep under control and may even set the stage for another
intifadah; and (2) Yassin's release was in fact in exchange for two Mossad
agents captured in Amman, Jordan, on 25 September for their botched assassination
attempt on Khaled Misha'al, the head of the Hamas Political Bureau.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In a show of goodwill, Yassin has offered to call a halt
to suicide bombings if the Israelis withdraw completely from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, remove all Jewish settlements, and release Palestinian prisoners.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is essential to point out that the Palestinian people
are not terrorists as suggested in a recently published list by the Clinton
Administration. The list contains about 30 names of 'terrorist' organizations
and labels around 10 of them as Palestinian in origin. The Sein Fein is
not listed at all, yet for years it's military wing, the Irish Republic
Army, has engaged in an armed struggle against its own oppression and was
involved in multiple bombings in the United Kingdom.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestine was Palestinian for more than 3,000 years until
an influx into Palestinian territory of mostly European Jews was allowed
by British colonists prior to the end of the Second World War.  War broke
out in 1948 when the heavily armed Jews (supplied with weapons by the West)
made Palestinian homes and orchards theirs and either killed or expelled
the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine to make way for a gathering of Jews
from all over the world who had and still have no claim to the land either
historically or legally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is only natural that through the years of ruthless
and cruel oppression, the surviving Palestinians would resist the occupation
of their land.  It is a fact that no Palestinian man, woman or child is
safe from Israeli tyranny that in turn produces counter-actions and -resistance
in a multitude of forms and shapes. As long as this oppression goes on,
the Palestinian people will continue to resist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Added to Israeli intransigence, the Palestinians now must
endure a double occupation against their new oppressor and tyrant, the Palestine
Authority who, often seen to be an agent for the Israelis, arrests those
who allegedly belong to the opposition or are Hamas activists. Thus, the
Palestinians are surrounded on all sides and from every angle, increasing
their despair and hopelessness and often making them desperate. The Oslo
accords have brought no significant changes and day-to-day living is never
secure and seldom fruitful. When a man is starving to death, he may be tempted
to steal in order to live.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that such heroes
as Sheikh Yassin are symbols to the masses.  Peace cannot be real unless
and until the Israelis withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jewish
settlements are removed, refugees return to their homeland, Palestinian
prisoners are released and the Palestinian people are given the freedom
they need to conduct their own affairs within a statehood they are entitled
to.  As long as these conditions do not exist, then there will always be
resistance in one form or another and it is more likely to become more desperate,
perhaps even more violent, than ever before.  It is a dangerous thing when
people are poor, are hungry, are cold, have no proper means to earn a living,
are without freedom and dignity, and have nowhere to turn.  The only way
to stop suicide bombings is to create an atmosphere where they are no longer
deemed necessary. There will always be war until the Israelis decide they
really want peace and are willing to listen to and act upon the demands
of a people who have already lost more than they can afford.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The real terrorists are not those Palestinians who concoct
molotov cocktails from nothing or who blows himself up with a homemade bomb
in order to set his people free, but the State of Israel, an armed state
that wages a war of terror and oppression against the native inhabitants
of Palestine. The next U.S. list published about terrorist organizations
should have Israel at the top.<BR>
