<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israel targets the Palestinian political leaders</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a grave escalation of Israel&#146;s undeclared war on the Palestinians,
the Israeli occupation army has begun targeting for assassination political leaders of the
Palestinian resistance groups.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new policy found expression on 31 July when American-made apache
helicopter gun-ships fired several electronically guided missiles at a building in
downtown Nablus that housed a media office affiliated with the Palestinian Islamic
resistance movement, Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deadly rockets reduced the building to rubble and twisted metal,
instantly killing eight civilians, including two prominent Islamist political leaders
(Jamal Salim and Jamal Mansour), two journalists, two academics and two children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bodies of the victims, which were shown on TV screens around the
world, were incinerated and mutilated beyond recognition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamist sources in Nablus described as &#147;cheap disinformation&#148;
Israeli media claims that Jamal Mansour, 42 and father of five children, was associated
with the Hamas military wing, the Izzedin al-Qassam Brigades.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Israelis know quite well that he had nothing to do with the
Hamas military wing; all he did was media work,&#148; said Sheikh Hasan Yousef, an
Islamist leader in Ramallah and a close friend of both Mansour and Salim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salim, 45, and father of seven children, was a lecturer at the Najah
University and apparently had no connections with the Hamas military wing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two killed journalists, Othman Katamani, 30, and the newlywed Fahim
Dawabshe, 22, were reportedly conducting an interview with Salim and Mansour at the time
of the bombing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both were ordinary journalists with an Islamic orientation but had no
affiliation with Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two other adults killed in the bombing were Omar Mansour, a cousin and
bodyguard of Jamal Mansour, and Muhammed Bishawi, a human rights activist who worked for
the Nablus-based society &#147;Solidarity International,&#148; which researches and
documents human rights violations in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most tragic of the victims are Ashraf Abdul Munim, 8, and his brother
Bilal, who were buried under rubble while sitting outside a grocery store down the street.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing triggered unprecedented bitterness and indignation throughout
the West Bank and Gaza Strip as tens of thousands of Palestinians spontaneously took to
the streets shortly after the bombing, denouncing the carnage and demanding revenge.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the slogans voiced also denounced Arab regimes for failing to
offer tangible political support for the Palestinians and especially for refusing to exert
pressure on Israel&#146;s strategic ally, the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, Hamas reacted to the murder of two of its most prominent and
intelligent political leaders by vowing to avenge their blood sooner rather than later.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza spokesman for Hamas, Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, described the killing in
Nablus as &#147;exceeding all red lines.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;From now on, all Israeli politicians, Knesset members and ministers,
from the criminal Sharon downward, will be legitimate targets for our martyrdom
operations.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah leaders, too, had a similar reaction, calling the carnage &#147;a
new hideous massacre added to Sharon&#146;s long list of massacres against our
people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, some of Fatah indignation was directed at the PA leadership for
failing to &#147;provide real protection for our people who are being killed and maimed
round-the-clock.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These strong words came from Husam Khader, a popular Fatah leader in the
Nablus region who in the past warned PA leader Yasser Arafat against caving in to Israeli
and American pressure on the question of the right of return for Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an interview with an Arab satellite television station an hour after
the carnage, Khader lashed out at Arafat for &#147;behaving as if things are normal.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have 70,000 guns in storage under PA disposal; my question to Abu
Ammar (Arafat) is: why don&#146;t we use them to defend ourselves? Should we wait until
they (the Israelis) liquidate half of our people?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The horrible killing in Nablus ended a week of murder and &#147;quiet
assassinations&#148; carried out by the Israeli occupation army that claimed the lives of
at least 18 Palestinians and scores of others, including four children who were badly
wounded and disfigured by indiscriminate Israeli artillery bombardment of civilian
neighbourhoods in Gaza and Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 29 July, another wholesale &#147;quiet assassination&#148; took place
at the village of Tubas just outside Nablus. The Israeli army detonated via remote control
a large bomb which Israeli agents had planted at a junkyard where six Fatah activists were
about to have their dinner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The powerful blast mutilated the bodies of the six youths, severing the
head of one of them and scattering their flesh and limbs over a 50-metre radius.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing was bitterly condemned by the PA, which called on the world
community to &#147;protect us from the neo-Nazis.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Without jury, without trial, without arrest, without charge, without
anything they decide that somebody ought to die, and they send their murderers and kill
them,&#148; said Nablus Governor Mahmoud Alul.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></i><u><strong>Retaliation</strong></u><br>
The assassination of that many Palestinians, including unmistakable political leaders of
the Palestinian political movements, in such a short time is expected to put tremendous
pressure on Hamas, Fatah and other resistance groups to mount what one Hamas spokesman
called &#147;qualitative retaliatory attacks.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We must strike terror in their hearts, otherwise they will kill us
all, one by one,&#148; said the spokesman who asked for anonymity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloodied escalation of the Israeli rampage against the Palestinians is
also likely to prompt the PA to be more outspoken in demanding that influential Arab
States with good ties to the U.S. exert pressure on the Americans to rein-in Israeli
savagery.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few days ago, PA official Sa&#146;eb Ureikat told the Voice of Palestine
that &#147;our problem is not only with Israel and the United States; it is also with the
Arab regimes that refuse to tell the U.S. that enough is enough.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There are thousands of American companies operating in the Arab
world; if the Arabs stopped drinking Coca Cola, this alone would force the Americans to
review their blind support for Israel.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Muslims thwart Jewish attempts to lay <br>
&#147;Temple cornerstone&#148; at Haram al-Sharif</font></b><i></h3>
</i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thousands of Muslims converged on Jerusalem&#146;s Haram al-Sharif on
Sunday, 29 July, in response to an earlier call by Muslim officials and succeeded in
thwarting a high-profile attempt by a Jewish terrorist group to lay a &#147;cornerstone
for the third Jewish temple&#148; at the esplanade of the Aqsa Mosque, Islam&#146;s third
holiest shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks to the presence of so many Muslims, and due to stern warnings from
Muslim leaders in Palestine and abroad, the messianic Jewish group was forced to conduct
its &#147;cornerstone-laying ceremony&#148; outside the confines of the old town and to
make it as brief as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrorists, who were protected by thousands of Israeli troops and
policemen, brought a rock on a truck to the Maghariba Gate, set it down for a while and
then took it back to West Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The symbolic act, said Jewish terrorist leader Gershon Solomon, was meant
to show Jewish determination to destroy Islamic holy places in Jerusalem in order to
expedite the &#147;rebuilding&#148; of the Jewish temple.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, thousands of Muslims from Jerusalem itself and 1948-Palestine
(not a single Muslim from the West Bank and Gaza was allowed to reach Jerusalem since the
two territories have been hermetically closed for the past ten months) arrived at the
Haram al-Sharif to repulse the terrorists from desecrating Islamic shrines.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamist leaders in Palestine and abroad had warned that Muslims would
under no circumstances allow Jews to desecrate their holy places.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Jews know well that any aggression against Islam&#146;s third
holiest place will lead to grave consequences including bloodshed,&#148; said a statement
released by the Muslim Ulema League, which has a membership of hundreds of Muslim
religious scholars.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Yemen and Iran, among other countries, voiced
strong protests at Zionist provocation, calling the stone-laying ceremony a &#147;naked
aggression.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The strong Muslim stance prompted the Zionist regime to assure Muslims
that &#147;the matter was blown out of proportion&#148; and that the Temple Mount Faithful
will not be allowed to enter the Haram al-Sharif.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, both Muslim and PA officials in Palestine rejected Israeli
assurances.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mahmoud al-Zahar of Hamas said the Zionists couldn&#146;t be trusted. He
accused the Israeli government and official religious establishment of conniving with the
terrorist group of the Temple Mount Faithful to test the extent of Muslim forbearance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They want to test our determination before taking the next
step,&#148; said al-Zahar in a press interview on 29 July.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, PA official Yasser Abed Rabbo accused the Zionists of seeking to
gain time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said the Israeli government was trying to prepare the international
public opinion for another attempt at desecrating the holy places of Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He argued that the problem was the Israeli occupation, adding that
&#147;as long as the occupation structure remains intact, the dangers facing Muslim and
Christian holy places will not disappear.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bloodshed at holy site</b></u><br>
As Muslims repulsed a group of Jewish fanatics from desecrating the holy places a few
hours after the stone-laying ceremony ended in failure, hundreds of Israeli occupation
soldiers and policemen, in full rioting gear, stormed the normally tranquil holy place,
triggering violent clashes with peaceful worshipers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists fired rubber-coated metal bullets, stun grenades and tear gas
canisters into the crowd consisting of thousands of men, women and children who were
getting ready to perform their congregational noon prayer. In addition, crack border
policemen used clubs rather savagely to beat the defenseless worshipers and journalists
and cameramen who came to cover the showdown.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The worshipers, infuriated by the brazenness of the Zionist provocation,
sought to defend themselves and and their holy place by hurling stones and shoes at the
encroaching Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And by the time of the noon prayer, the toll was 70 Palestinians injured,
including people with serious eye injuries and brain concussions, according to medical
sources in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists State-run radio spoke of 15 policemen getting injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslim Wakf officials accused the Zionists of provoking the clashes by
allowing Jewish extremists to come close to the gates of Haram al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I hold the Israeli occupation government fully responsible for this
mad violence; they should have realized that allowing the terrorists to provoke the
Muslims would invite a strong Muslim response,&#148; said Sheikh Muhammed Hussein, the
most senior Wakf official at the Aqsa Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tension eventually subsided toward the afternoon when the Zionist police
left the site, thus allowing Wakf officials to calm down angry protesters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is likely that any &#147;calm&#148; in Jerusalem would be
short-lived, given the determination of Jewish terrorist groups to ignite the flames of
hatred and violence in Jerusalem and throughout Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, most messianic Jewish groups believe that it is imperative that
violence and bloodshed on a very large scale take place in order to induce and accelerate
the advent of the Jewish messiah or redeemer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Palestinians marched through the West Bank
and Gaza on 29 July to protest Jewish designs against Islam&#146;s third holiest place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As many as 15,000 Hamas supporters marched in Gaza, vowing to defend and
protect al-Aqsa mosque with &#147;blood and soul.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We call upon Muslims around the world to be vigilant and to open
their eyes in defense of al-Aqsa Mosque&#133;the Jews are continuing their sick efforts to
destroy our holy place, the first Qibla and the third holiest Islamic site,&#148; said a
statement issued by Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement called on Muslims everywhere to show the Zionists by words
and deeds that &#147;we will not stand idle while our holy places are attacked and
targeted for destruction.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials, seeking to downplay the entire episode for public
relations purposes, claimed that the Temple Mount Faithful was a small and marginal group
and that it didn&#146;t pose a threat to the Haram al-Sharif and Islamic holy places
thereon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is amply clear that the group enjoys the support and backing
of hundreds of thousands of Israelis, including government officials and cabinet ministers
such as Rahba&#146;am Zeivi, Avigdor Liberman and other ministers from right-wing and
religious parties in the Sharon coalition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the right-wing Israeli newspaper, the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>,
published an on-line poll on 30 July showing that as many as 69% of its readers support
the designs and goals of the terrorist group.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This shows that Muslims ought to be vigilant, irrespective of what the
Zionists and despotic Arab and Muslim governments, for whom the dignity of Muslims means
nothing, say about this grave assault on one of Islam&#146;s holiest places.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, an Umma (community) that can&#146;t protect its honour and
dignity from Zionist vandalism and insolence doesn&#146;t have the right to life in a
world that believes only in force.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon opts for &#147;quiet assassinations&#148;</font></b><font SIZE="2"></h3>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist regime stepped up its undeclared war on the essentially
unarmed Palestinian population, employing a new method known as &#147;quiet
assassinations&#148; aimed at murdering as many activists as possible and as quietly as
possible for the purpose of avoiding negative international reactions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new virulent policy, adopted in mid-July during a special session of
the Israeli Inner Council on Security, assumes the form of murdering &#147;wanted
activists&#148; at point-blank range or planting high-intensity bombs in their homes and
cars, and then claiming that they were killed as a result of &#147;internal
vendettas&#148; or &#147;work accidents&#148; while preparing explosive devices intended
to be used against Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In so doing, the Israeli army hopes it will kill two birds with one stone:
first making sure the &#147;terrorists&#148; are liquidated and, second, creating a
modicum of vagueness surrounding the murder, thus avoiding international criticisms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli occupation army (IOA) began putting the new virulent policy
into effect on 19 July when Shin Bet agents placed and detonated via remote control a
large bomb in Fatah&#146;s main office in downtown Hebron, killing 34-year-old Raja&#146;e
Abu Rajab, a father of three.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli media carried an IOA statement denying any involvement in the
murder and parroted the charge that Abu Rajab was actually killed in a &#147;work
accident&#148; while preparing a bomb intended for use against the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, there was not one iota of truth in either claim. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The campaign of murder went on as Israeli helicopter gun-ships on 22 July
fired several missiles at the home of Ibrahim Jaber, who is involved in Islamic youth and
charitable activities, destroying the house completely. Jaber himself was not hurt as he
was praying at the nearby mosque at the time of the bombing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas spokesman in Jenin, Khalid al-Haj, described the bombing as &#147;a
criminal assassination attempt on the life of a person because of his political
beliefs.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They (the Israelis) are acting like street thugs and
gangsters&#133;.Israel is a criminal State and its leaders are war criminals who ought to
be prosecuted for their crimes sooner or later.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following day, 23 July, Israeli undercover soldiers, disguised as
Palestinian labourers, attempted to assassinate an Islamic Jihad activist in Bethlehem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The masked soldiers, armed with guns fitted with silencers, fired several
bullets at Khalid al-Heremi, 29, while walking well inside area (A) which is supposed to
be under full control of the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fortunately, the man was only moderately injured. The Israeli terrorists
fled toward the nearby army outpost at the Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque which the Israeli
government had converted into a synagogue despite strong Muslim opposition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The IOA spokesman said in a terse statement that he had no knowledge of
the incident, adding that &#147;it was probably an internal Palestinian scuffle.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two similar &#147;quiet&#148; assassination attempts took place in Nablus,
this time targeting PFLP activists and resulting in two of them being injured, one
seriously. Again, the Israeli spokesman dismissed the two incidents as &#147;work
accidents.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The murders continued and with little media coverage from the Israeli
side. On 23 July, the Israeli army raided Anin, near Jenin in the northern part of the
West Bank, placing the small hamlet under curfew.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anin falls within area � meaning that the Israeli army has full control
over it. However, this did not prevent ten Israeli soldiers from walking straight to one
of the homes at the village and murdering Mustafa Isa Yasin at point-blank rage as he
stepped out of his home after being ordered to do so by the soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They could have arrested him; he was unarmed and murdered in cold
blood,&#148; said his brother Ahmed Yasin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasin had earlier been detained for 12 hours but was released, apparently
so that he could be murdered in a less suspicious manner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And as usual in such circumstances, the Israeli army spokesman concocted a
statement alleging that Yasin was killed while trying to escape.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In the midst of an attempt by an undercover border police unit to
arrest Yasin, he tried to escape, and after calling for him to stop and issuing a warning,
he was shot and killed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two more Palestinians were murdered on 23 July; one identified as Nasser
Hasan, 32, who was found hung on a tree near the Jewish settlement of Kukab Sabah, and the
other, a 15-year-old boy whom Israeli occupation soldiers shot and killed while sitting in
the front yard of his home in Rafah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Virtually all these acts of murder pass without being investigated, a
clarion testimony to Israeli callousness and indifference to the loss of non-Jewish lives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the policy of murdering Palestinians and then lying about
it was adopted and announced by no other person than Sharon himself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few months ago, while on a visit to the Jordan Valley settlements,
Sharon told the settlers, &#147;There will be things which we will take credit for, and
there will be things we will deny, and there will be things we will never talk
about.&#148;</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></i><u><strong>Carnage at Edna</strong></u><br>
The latest spate of killings and murders by the Israeli occupation army was preceded by
the heinous murder of the Etmeizi family by Jewish terrorists at the village of Edna, 10
miles west of Hebron, on 19 July.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrorists, armed with M-16 rifles supplied by the Israeli army and
parked in a car just outside Edna, fired dozens of high-velocity bullets into a
Palestinian car carrying eight people home from a pre-wedding party.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a result, three persons, including 10-week-old infant Diya Helmi
Ethmeiz, and a recently married young man, Muhammed Etmeizi and his cousin Muhammed, were
immediately killed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Four other members of the family were seriously injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrorists fled westward toward the Jewish town of Kiryat Gad, built
on the ruins of the Arab town of Faluja, passing quietly through the army roadblock
without any of them stopped for the routine identity checking.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli officer in charge at the roadblock reportedly claimed that he
&#147;forgot&#148; to stop the car, suggesting a clear and definite connivance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some Israeli officials denounced the carnage, ostensibly for public
relations purposes, while others, like tourism minister Rahba&#146;am Zeivi, had the
chutzpah to charge that the Palestinians murdered their own people in order to expedite
the deployment of international observers in the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian officials described Zeivi&#146;s remarks as &#147;sick words
from a sick person.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, the terrorists have not been apprehended, probably because the
Israeli security services don&#146;t want to catch them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The list of conspirators and connivers and culprits in the Etmeizi family
carnage is indeed long. It includes the police, the Israeli army, the Shin Bet, the courts
and the Israeli President who routinely pardons Jewish murders of Palestinians after
serving a symbolic prison sentence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In November of last year, the Israeli court released two Jewish terrorists
(Yaron Degani and Gad Tena both of the settlement of Itamar near Nablus) only six days
after they murdered Farid Nassrah while harvesting olives at his orchard on the grounds of
insufficient evidence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the past nine moths, Israel has demonstrated in a brazen manner that it
is actually an apartheid State applying different rules to Arabs and Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, heavily armed Jewish settlers have, almost on a daily bases,

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Demolishing homes.. Sharon&#146;s message to the
Palestinians</font></b><font SIZE="2"></h3>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</b><br>
As the Israeli propaganda machine continued to lay the blame on Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat for the continuation of violence and bloodshed in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the Israeli government was busy demolishing more Arab homes in East Jerusalem
and elsewhere in the occupied territories early in the month of July. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new rabid onslaught against natural Palestinian demographic growth
began in the early morning hours of Monday, 9 July, when 15 army bulldozers, escorted by a
contingent of heavily armed soldiers and border policemen, raided the Shufa&#146;at
refugee camp, just north of Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The raid bore all the marks of a military operation. Heavily armed
soldiers took positions at strategic places and a helicopter gun-ship was hovering above,
ostensibly ready in case the tormented Palestinians decided to resist &#147;operation
peace for Jerusalem.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the bulldozers rumbled menacingly toward their targets (17 newly
constructed homes sheltering 17 abject refugee families), the nearly distraught
proprietors sought desperately to prevent the bulldozers from shattering the dream of
their life&#150;a concrete structure sheltering their families.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Soon the bulldozers &#147;went into action,&#148; pulverizing one home
after the other while the soldiers were busy beating the furious homeowners and angry
protesters, Jews and Arabs alike, who arrived at the refugee camp to express their
solidarity with the victims and indignation at the crime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At one point, the driver of one of the bulldozers threatened to crush a
Palestinian and an Israeli peace activist who lied down before the huge earth-moving
machine in a desperate attempt to prevent the destruction of the houses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the end of the day, the 17 houses were reduced to rubble and the lives
of 17 families were shattered for a long time to come as they started a new life of
homelessness because of the Israeli apartheid policy toward non-Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I don&#146;t know what to do; where will these children go
now?&#148; asked Jamal Subhi al-Faqih, whom the soldiers didn&#146;t even allow to get his
furniture and belongings out before the demolition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I can&#146;t build a new house; I&#146;m not even able to pay off
the debts of the demolished home&#133;there is so much oppression in this world.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli occupation authorities claimed the houses were built without a
license, a routine pretext used by the Jewish mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, to keep
Arab demographic growth at the very minimum.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The victims at Shufa&#146;at acknowledge the fact that their homes were
built without their obtaining a license beforehand. However, they earnestly insist that it
was virtually next to impossible for a Palestinian in Jerusalem to extract a building
license from Olmert&#146;s parsimonious hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I applied for a license 15 years ago, but since I&#146;m an Arab and
not a Jew, they told me I would have to wait,&#148; said Abdul Rahman Alkam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked how much longer the Israeli municipal council asked him to wait, he
said, &#147;Maybe until I die.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Authority official Yasser Abed Rabbo described the demolitions
as &#147;a nefarious and callous crime aimed at subjugating our people and breaking their
will to survive and withstand their oppression and persecution.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Destroying peoples&#146; homes is the ultimate violence; how can we
convince those tormented people that peace with Israel is possible? These crimes are only
deepening the hatred.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Legislative Council member Hatem Abdul Qader, who also arrived
at the scene to comfort the victims, dismissed the Israeli reasoning for demolishing the
homes as &#147;a dirty joke.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The license story is a big Israeli lie, and nobody knows this fact
better than the Israelis themselves; the naked truth is that they want the land to go to
the Jews for expanding Jewish settlements, and the Palestinians can go to hell.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Expansion of settlements</b></u><br>
According to Palestinian and Israeli press sources, the wholesale destruction of the 17
houses at Shufa&#146;at, along with the planned demolition of scores of other houses, is
apparently aimed at confiscating the land where the demolished homes stood for expanding
the Jewish settlement of Pisgat Zeiv and creating Jewish demographic continuity with the
French Hill settlement north of Jerusalem.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More demolitions</b></u><br>
On 10 July, the Zionist occupation army destroyed as many as 20 additional houses at the
Yibna refugee camp in Rafah. The destruction of the homes left as many as 200 men, women
and children homeless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army bragged about the barbarian act, suggesting it was
carried out to break the will of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We destroyed the homes so that the Palestinians will understand that
we have the upper hand,&#148; said a gleeful Zionist spokesman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest destruction in Rafah brings to 200 the residential homes the
Zionists have destroyed in the Rafah area alone during the past nine months.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the beginning of the Palestinian intifada, the Israeli army
destroyed as many as 600 Palestinian homes throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strp, mainly
as a reprisal for the Palestinian intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The brutal measure resulted in thousands of men, women and children
becoming refugees, some for the third time, and homeless in their own homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Home demolition had been adopted as an &#147;official policy&#148; since
the early days of the Israeli occupation in 1967, and human rights groups estimate that as
many as 30,000 Palestinian homes were destroyed since then.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the Israeli government virtually pays no attention to the
callous practice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a Nobel Prize winner,
didn&#146;t object to the latest demolitions as a matter of principle, e.g. as an act of
brutal immorality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These dramatic demolitions are not received well in the world;
I&#146;m afraid we will have a difficult time explaining them to the world,&#148; said
Peres.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat losing control over public</b></u><br>
The largely unmitigated Israeli repression of the overall Palestinian population is making
it extremely difficult for Yasser Arafat to convince his people that they have anything to
gain from the present &#147;cease-fire&#148; which is rich in form but very poor in
substance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, with the Sharon government upholding its policy of subjugation,
assassination, abduction and home demolition toward the Palestinian people, Arafat will be
utterly unable, even if willing, to control the Palestinian public.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But weakening Arafat and corroding his authority may well be Sharon&#146;s
ultimate policy toward the PA since it could perceivably enable the certified war criminal
to declare that &#147;Arafat doesn&#146;t control his people,&#148; and eventually allow
him to dislodge from the peace process altogether. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon obfuscates futile strategy with brutal
tactics</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b><br>
Notwithstanding his declared &#147;policy of restraint&#148;, and despite his ostensible,
though disingenuous, acceptance of the Mitchell Committee report and the Tenet work plan,
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, along with his coterie of war criminals and big-time
murderers, has again instructed the Zionist occupation army to kill, maim, destroy and
terrorize the Palestinians as much as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new policy is euphemistically called &#147;active defense
posture&#148; and aimed at ravaging and crippling the Palestinian people in general,
particularly those active in the struggle for freedom from 33 years of malignant Israeli
apartheid and occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This policy of &#147;active defense&#148; or more correctly &#147;active
terrorism&#148; manifests itself in the most brazen manner nearly everyday.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the almost daily targeted assassinations, murders, abductions,
detonation of booby-trapped cars and planting of bombs in Palestinian homes and cars earns
Israel the status of the world&#146;s premier terrorist nation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s terrorists status becomes even more justified in light of
the fact that the vast bulk of Jewish terror victims happen to be ordinary Palestinians
who are occupied more with securing a loaf of bread for their starving children and less
with resisting Jewish apartheid and colonialism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, the Jewish mill of mendacity spares no time or effort in
trying to justify and rationalize the silent Zionist holocaust against the Palestinian
people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, we see Zionist officials and media making frantic efforts to
justify the genocidal acts which Israeli troops and ultra-orthodox and heavily-armed
Jewish fanatics carry out against defenseless Palestinian civilians, concocting claims
that the victims were either on their way to carry out attacks against Israeli targets or
had been involved in past attacks and &#147;acts of terror&#148; against Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, given the brazen campaign of lies, misinformation, disinformation
and virulent propaganda the Sharon government and Jewish-controlled American media are
waging around the world, which often obfuscate many vital facts pertaining to the
Jewish-perpetrated genocide against the Palestinians, it would be na�ve to believe
anything said these days by the liar-slayer and his government of liars and murderers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A glimpse at recent Zionist terror throughout the West Bank demonstrates
that Jewish criminality and barbarianism are limitless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In late June, the Israeli occupation army sent its bulldozers to Yatta to
destroy scores of houses and shanties, leaving as many as 300 men, women and children
homeless. Likewise, vineyards, orchards and vegetable fields belonging to the Arabs were
vandalized and destroyed. Eighteen more homes in Shufa&#146;at and an equal number of
houses in Rafah were destroyed in mid-July.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As usual, army spokespersons claimed the homes were built without a
license, a mantra whose intonation has justified every conceivable act of savagery against
the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the Palestinians and human rights activists, however, this claim is,
of course, a farrago of nonsense.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the assassination of the five Palestinian activists near Jenin
earlier in July demonstrated that Sharon has ordered his army to act as a gang of thugs,
hoodlums and street criminals but, unlike street criminals, with the service of a powerful
army, apache helicopters and F-15 and F-16 fighter jets at their disposal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, the autopsies of two of the martyrs killed in Jenin,
performed at the Abu Kabir forensic institute and carried out by Israeli, Palestinian and
Scottish doctors, showed that they were tortured extensively in manners defying linguistic
description before they were executed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, the Zionists lied about what happened, claiming that the two were
killed in an exchange of fire. The truth, however, as determined by the autopsy, was that
the Zionists captured the two alive, took them to an unknown place, tortured them in a
barbaric manner, and then killed them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing continued unabated in July by the Israeli occupation army
(IOA) and the settler terrorists alike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the assassination and extra-judicial execution near Jenin, the
Zionists assassinated the Sa&#146;ada brothers in Bethlehem (one of them was a peace
activist and member of an Israeli-Palestinian group called &#147;educators for
peace.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The massacre was executed using American-supplied apache helicopters and
resulted in the death and incineration of two brothers and their cousins, who were
drinking tea in a building near the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then came the massacre of the Etmeizi family and the celebration by
Jewish settlers of the killing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then there was the killing of Raja&#146;e Abu Rajab in Hebron, followed by
the murder of Salah al-Din Darwaza in Nablus on 25 July. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An eye for an eye</b></u><br>
Enraged by the continuing Israeli onslaught and exasperated by any appreciable improvement
in the overall situation on the ground, Palestinian leaders have warned that the
Palestinians would &#147;meet bullets with bullets and death with death.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah West Bank leader Marwan al-Barghouthi, who may have been placed on
the updated version of Israel&#146;s &#147;assassination list,&#148; described the
cease-fire as a &#147;big lie.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He told the Qatari satellite television station, al-Jazeera, on 2 July
that it was Sharon, not the Palestinians, who is violating and corroding the cease-fire by
giving his army a free rein to murder Palestinian cadres and his settlers to keep up their
rampage of violence and vandalism against Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These bullets, rockets, explosives and missiles that target our
cadres, freedom strugglers and ordinary citizens undermine all understandings and
agreements.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He castigated the CIA-arranged cease-fire as &#147;a big lie which Sharon
uses to mislead the international public opinion and block attempts at providing
protection for our defenseless people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamist leaders were even less diplomatic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We will meet death with death; we shall not accept that our blood be
shed and their blood be spared; the battle with the Zionists is long and painful, and we
shall not flinch from carrying out our duty,&#148; said an Islamic Jihad activist in the
Jenin area, who asked for anonymity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When pressed to say if his group would abide by the cease-fire, the
Islamist leader said the &#147;cease-fire can go to hell&#133;I don&#146;t see a
cease-fire; what I see is assassinations, rockets and missiles&#133;do you call that a
cease-fire?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas, too, promised to avenge the assassination of one of its prominent
political leaders in Nablus, Salah Darwaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;His blood will not go in vain,&#148; said an Islamist leader during
the funeral procession that was attended by tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, this view is enjoying almost universal acceptance among
Palestinians, including some of the closest people to Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We made every conceivable effort to consolidate the cease-fire, but
it is becoming abundantly clear that Mr. Sharon has neither the will nor the inclination
to abide by the cease-fire. The Palestinian Authority can&#146;t possibly ask people not
to defend themselves in the face of brazen aggression and acts of murder by the occupation
army and settlers,&#148; said Ahmed Abdul Rahman, a senior Palestinian spokesman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Arafat himself, while reiterating PA adherence to the cease-fire,
accused the Sharon government of seeking to &#147;crush the Palestinian people and destroy
the Palestinian Authority.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We know what he is up to; he wants to crush the Palestinian
Authority and subjugate the Palestinian people,&#148; said Arafat before meeting with
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah in Alexandria, Egypt, on 3 July.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Public relations ploy</b></u><br>
Arafat&#146;s diagnosis of Sharon&#146;s intentions doesn&#146;t seem to be far-fetched or
phobic by any measure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon&#146;s only public acceptance of the Mitchell Committee report, the
Tenet plan and the cease-fire was never motivated by any genuine desire to bring about
calm and put an end to bloodshed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hebrew press, even some officials and ministers in the Sharon
government, made it amply clear that &#147;public relations,&#148; not &#147;good
intentions,&#148; mandated his &#147;tactical acceptance&#148; of the Tenet plan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If true, Sharon&#146;s tactical goal of ravaging the Palestinian
Authority, e.g. carrying out massive and widespread operations against the autonomous
enclaves, remains largely intact and is only awaiting opportune timing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And it seems clear that Sharon hopes he can seize the opportunity to
achieve his ominous goal by provoking the Palestinians to carry out &#147;acts of
terror&#148; against Israeli Jewish settlers or, worse, one or two martyrdom operations
inside 1948-Palestine, in the hope that this would provide the former general and his
war-like chief of staff Shaul Mofaz with the needed excuse to go &#147;wild&#148; against
the PA and bring the Palestinians to their knees. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the Palestinian Authority seems to be fully aware of
Sharon&#146;s designs and is doing all it can to foil them, adopting a two-track policy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the PA is reasserting Palestinian commitment to the cease-fire
despite the spate of assassinations carried out by the Israeli army and in spite of
mounting Palestinian indignation at the Israeli provocation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, Arafat is trying to mobilize as many countries as he can to
restrain Sharon and prevent him from carrying out his threats.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian leader seems to have made some success in this regard as
the United States and European governments criticized the latest targeted killings of
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More significantly, Arafat is finding some solace in the fact that Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres is succeeding, at least for the time being, in restraining the
raging bull (Sharon) from launching a blitzkerg on the Palestinians as demanded by his
right-wing colleagues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 3 July, Peres went as far as threatening to quit the government if he
was not allowed to practice his authority as Foreign Minister and if the government
decided to de-legitimize Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear, though, if Peres&#146;s warnings were a genuine
expression of disenchantment with his boss&#146;s bellicose policies or just meant as a
ruse to encourage Arafat to be make more efforts to restore calm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, it seems that there is not very much Arafat can do to meet
Peres&#146;s expectations, especially in light of the reactivation and expected escalation
of the &#147;assassination policy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, at the same time, is having an increasingly vigilant public
opinion which can&#146;t be easily controlled and is difficult to beguile.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Arafat&#146;s ability to control the Palestinian public opinion,
presuming he has the desire to do so, is almost wholly dependent on the behaviour of the
other side, Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And since Sharon is unwilling to make any &#147;concessions&#148; to the
Palestinians due to political or ideological reasons, Arafat can&#146;t be expected to be
able, even if willing, to budge to Israeli demands and pressure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this case, desensitizing the current showdown would be extremely
difficult, and more deterioration can be expected.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the final analysis, this might be Sharon&#146;s ultimate tactic, namely
inducing a situation whereby Arafat can be declared as &#147;unable to control his
people,&#148; which then would give Israel the right to take whatever measures it deems
appropriate to defend itself against &#147;Palestinian terror.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such could be the scenario whereby Sharon would be able, at least
temporarily, to obfuscate the futility of his strategy toward the Palestinians (presumably
Zionist orthodoxy) by highlighting , once again, the brutality he is capable of meting out
to the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hasn&#146;t that always been the case?</p>

munitions against civilians</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The Israeli occupation army admitted using
internationally-prohibited munitions against Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli State-run radio quoted a senior army officer as saying that
the army &#147;has been using tank-fired flechette anti-personnel shells&#148; against
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This lethal type of munitions killed three Palestinian women from one
family from south of the Gaza Strip on 9 June, and claimed many other lives in the course
of the 8-month-old Palestinian intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli officer said the use of the deadly shell against individuals
was &#147;legitimate,&#148; claiming the army was authorized to use it &#147;outside
populated areas.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians, however, strongly dispute the claim, stressing that
hundreds of flechette shells were fired on residential areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hospital sources in Gaza, especially in the Rafah area, spoke of hundreds
of civilians wounded by the darts released when the shell explodes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to <i>Jane&#146;s Defense Weekly</i>, the Israeli army is using
a modified version of the M949 105 mm APERS-T round provided by the U.S. in the 1970s.
According to a U.S. manual, the round is &#147;designed for close-in assault against
massed infantry assaults and for offensive fire against exposed enemy personnel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army fitted the M949 shell with the Reshef Technologies OMEGA
M127 electronic fuse, which is set, before the round is fired. At the set range, the
forward section of the M949 round ruptures, releasing approximately 5,000 small flechette
darts and a dye marker. The flechettes are dispersed in a cone-shaped pattern, which is
300 metres long, and about 94 metres wide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian security official Abdul Razzaq al-Majayda described the use of
the flechette shells against Palestinian civilians as &#147;a manifestly blatant war
crime.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Their aim is to maim, cripple and kill as many people as
possible,&#148; said Majayda.</p>

from Palestine, which they call Eretz Yisrael, or Land of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1994, a settler named Baruch Goldstein, a physician, murdered 29
Palestinian worshippers as they were praying at the Ibrahimi Mosque in downtown Hebron.</p>

and erected a memorial plaque for him in the settlement of Kiryat Araba to perpetuate his

troops demolished as many as 20 homes, for no other reason than tormenting the
Palestinians for their resistance against the Zionist occupation and domination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hansen pointed out that the proprietors of the demolished homes were
surprised by Israeli tanks rumbling menacingly toward their homes shortly after midnight,
forcing them to flee for their lives, even without getting their belongings out.</p>
