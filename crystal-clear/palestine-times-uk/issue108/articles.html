<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; From Khaled Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After 20 years of sinister military occupation of Southern Lebanon, the
Israeli army, and its puppet quislings, known as the South Lebanese Army, left Lebanon on
23 May with their &#147;tail between their legs.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ignominious retreat was carried out under the cover of dark after it
became apparent that the southern Lebanese militia were collapsing and fleeing to Israel
to escape possible retribution from Hizbullah and certain prosecution from the Lebanese
government for treason and grand treachery.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the quislings, especially those who couldn&#146;t make it to
northern Palestine for one reason or the other, surrendered to Hizbullah fighters, who in
turn handed them over to the Lebanese authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the bulk of the disgraced collaborators and their families,
around 6,400 of them, crossed to Palestine to become refugees, an inescapable, though
small, price they had to pay for betraying their country and their people and also for the
numerous crimes they perpetrated against their people, including murder, rape and torture.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Hizbullah and other Lebanese resistance groups entered the
villages and towns of South Lebanon almost as soon as they were vacated by the Israeli
soldiers and the disintegrated militia of the quislings. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There, the Islamist fighters were given a hero&#146;s welcome by the local
population who apparently breathed a sigh of relief, having delivered themselves from the
shackles of the Zionists for over two decades of occupation, persecution, repression and
constant torment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And within a short time, Hizbullah fighters, wielding their automatic
rifles, were walking with their heads held high along the Lebanese side of the border with
only a few metres separating them from Zionist troops on the other side of the
Lebanon-Palestine border.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Lebanese citizen screamed at the Zionists, &#147;We&#146;ll see you in
liberated Jerusalem&#133;today is Lebanon, tomorrow is Jerusalem.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Freeing detainees at Khiam</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a triumph of victory, the Islamic fighters, along with ordinary
Lebanese citizens, stormed the notorious Khiam Prison, liberating hundreds of Lebanese
inmates who were routinely tortured by the Zionists and their SLA quislings for refusing
to collaborate with Israel or on suspicion of aiding the Lebanese resistance movements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There, the torture tools were all in place: the whipping pole, the spikes,
the window grilles where prisoners were tied naked for days, the handcuffs, and the
electric machines used to jolt prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The abandoned manacles were testimony to the horrible crimes that had
taken place just a few days earlier, very much like what goes on in Israeli jails and
detention centres inside Palestine Proper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shouting &#147;Allahu Akbar&#148; (God is the most Great), hundreds of
prisoners were able to see freedom, not realizing that their torturer prison-keepers had
just fled like panicking rats southward.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The scene was too overwhelming and fraught with outpouring emotions to be
described by words, as many of the prisoners thought they would never see freedom again.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khiam was one of the stories of horror, terror and sinister inhumanity
that the retreating Israeli occupation left over in Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was a weird and terrifying place of torture, where Lebanese citizens
were systematically subjected to all forms of torture for the purpose of extracting
confessions from them or simply to get them to collaborate with the Zionist occupation
troops against their own people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the internees suffered irreparable damage, losing a hand, a leg,
eyesight or suffering a psychological trauma that will stay with them for the rest of
their life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I was hung naked for 13 days&#133;they put a bag on my head and
threw cold water over me night and day,&#148; said a liberated prisoner, quoted by Robert
Fisk of the British newspaper, <i>Independent</i>,<i> </i>on 25 May.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Fisk, who visited the notorious lockup on 24 May, the
handcuffs bore the trademark &#147;The Peerless Handcuff Co., Springfield, Mass. Made in
USA.&#148; These handcuffs were used to bind the arms of prisoners before
interrogation&#133;and they wore them day and night, as they were kicked so badly that in
Ramadan&#146;s case they had to amputate his arm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The hoods were still there, big light-blue corduroy sacks with
towels inside&#150;some of the towels bought from Norwegian Unifil soldiers because the UN
globe was embroidered on some of them&#150;and so was the wire with which other prisoners,
including women, were beaten&#133;big, thick wire bound in blue plastic&#133;the torturers
were sadistic, often stupid men&#133;there were pornographic magazines and cheap comics
and puzzle books in their filthy quarters. Israel has admitted teaching these men how to
do their job.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sacrifices breed victory</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli retreat from Lebanon was not precipitated by a change of heart
on the part of the Zionist establishment or by a sudden awakening of a human conscience
among the leaders of the Israeli establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The retreat was forced upon the Zionist regime by the mounting losses that
the Zionists incurred in the course of their lengthy occupation of a large area of
Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Over 1,200 young Israeli soldiers have been killed in Lebanon since 1980,
and several thousand soldiers and civilians were injured, prompting Israeli military
leaders and ordinary soldiers to question the wisdom of staying in Lebanon and continuing
to suffer a &#147;curse&#148; called Hizbullah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But more importantly, the Israeli society itself grew increasingly
impatient and unwilling to bear the bloody costs of its enduring occupation in southern
Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, large segments of the Israeli Jewish population began to question
the logic of endangering and losing young Israeli lives especially in the absence of a
convincing cause. And this feeling would always be vindicated and justified, with every
televised image of Israeli soldiers brought from Lebanon in coffins.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, Lebanon in effect became Israel&#146;s Vietnam, a thorn in
Israel&#146;s side, and a source of perpetual suffering and death for the Zionist
establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the source of all of this was a small, irregular but dedicated
fighter-force of a few hundred fighters called Hizbullah, the Party of God.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This force, built around 500 core members, represented a new generation of
fighting Muslims, unlike anything seen in the previous Arab-Israeli
wars&#133;well-organized, well-trained and above all well-motivated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, what made Hizbullah&#146;s fighters excel in the battlefield
against the greatest military power in the Middle East is their almost innate and
unlimited readiness to die as martyrs for a noble cause deserving all possible sacrifices.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was Jihad, or just sacred struggle against oppression and aggression, a
struggle against the occupation and rape of their homeland by an arrogant enemy that was
only interested in subjugating them and usurping their human and natural rights and
occupying their land&#133;on the mere account that it was stronger than them and that
might was right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But might did not make right in the Lebanese context thanks to the Muslim
David who exhausted the Jewish Zionist Goliath who found that his unwanted presence in
Lebanon was not without a price and that since conditional withdrawal was not possible,
given Hizbullah&#146;s determination to keep up the struggle no matter what, unconditional
withdrawal was therefore inevitable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the leadership of Hizbullah, in addition to its determination and
resilience, was also exemplary in its integrity and steadfastness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Hasan Nasrullah, like his late predecessor martyr Abbas Musawi,
would not allow any distance to separate him from his fighters, as his own son was among
the martyrs. In short, the leader was just one of the fighters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And he was not infected by the virus of corruption, as many other leaders
in the contemporary Arab world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That alone commanded the respect of enemies and friends alike, and made
the fighters and the would-be martyrs embarking on Jihad against the Zionists do so with
serene hearts, free of doubts, suspicions or grudges.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there was more to the Hizbullah leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It didn&#146;t indulge in behind-the-curtain dealings with the Zionists,
nor did it compromise on the general principles, and it didn't allow itself to be used and
manipulated by the enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The leadership stood by its words&#133;that the fighting would continue
till the last Israeli soldier left our homeland&#133;and so it was.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There was complete concordance between its words and its actions, and it
did not say one thing and did quite the opposite in secret, as the PLO leadership often
has done and continues to do.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All this produced a clean victory, without interim agreements, without
redeployment phases, without truncating South Lebanon into areas A, B and C, or H-1 and
H-2, and certainly without security coordination with the occupying powers against their
own people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Will Arafat learn the lesson from Sheikh Nasrullah? We doubt it very much,
for Arafat and ilk come from a different breed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, it is clear that only through the route of Hizbullah and
Hamas, the path of Jihad and resistance, will the Palestinians be able to regain their
homeland and dignity. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since its creation in 1948 Israel has never, not even once, recognized,
let alone complied with, a UN Security Council resolution. Assured of unconditional U.S.
support, for more than fifty years Israelis terrorized the peoples of Palestine, Lebanon,
Jordan and Egypt and perpetrated the most <br>
hideous of crimes. <br>
Israel could afford to expand and occupy more land over the years because Arab weakness
gave it the green light to do so. After several years of venturing into Southern Lebanon
since 1978, Israeli political and military leaders defied all laws and norms by storming,
unprovoked, deep into Lebanon in 1982. More than half of the country, including the
capital Beirut, came under direct Israeli occupation. Former Israeli defense minister
Sharon stood in the heart of Beirut to announce that his troops were there to stay.
Indeed, nothing would have compelled the Israelis to withdraw. The UN and international
law meant nothing to them and they did not believe the Arabs had the guts to do anything
having failed repeatedly in the past. <br>
Soon afterwards, the Israelis discovered they had ventured into a quagmire. Lebanon was to
become a graveyard for their troops. Still over confident and blinded from seeing the
implications of their adventure, the Israelis created an army of collaborators whom they
thought could be relied on for maintaining a buffer zone in the south of the country. The
ploy was alleged to have been aimed at protecting Jewish settlements in the north of
Palestine from 'terrorist' attacks. But in time neither the army of collaborators nor the
so-called 'undefeatable' army of Israel with its sophisticated weaponry and mythical
reputation was of any good. In May 2000 the entire world watched with amazement as Israeli
troops pulled out under the cover of darkness <br>
leaving behind their army of collaborators to disintegrate within hours. <br>
Hizbullah has succeeded where the Arab states have failed. The two decades of Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon have exposed Israel and enlightened the world about the real
nature of this Jewish colonial enclave in the heart of the Muslim world. The Israeli
humiliating defeat at <br>
the hands of Hizbullah has proven beyond doubt that the Hebrew state understands no
language but that of force. This is an entity that is comprised of Jewish immigrants who
came in search of the land of milk and honey and not of pain and agony. Paradise had been
promised to them by those who recruited them for one of the most inhumane projects in the
history of humanity. Occupying other people's lands and homes turned to hell compounded by
the fact that Israeli cowardice and fear of death is met with unique bravery by their
victims and love of death in martyrdom. <br>
During the glorious days of the Palestinian Intifada (uprising), former Israeli Prime
Minister Isaac Rabin wished that one day he'd wake up from his sleep to be told that Gaza
had been swept away by the sea. So deep was the trouble he found himself in although his
troops were the ones that broke the bones of stone-throwing Palestinians and shot at them
with live bullets. At the time the Intifada had still been restricted to the use of stones
and peaceful means of protest. Nevertheless, that was too much for the Israelis who grew
accustomed to meeting no resistance and engaging no real fighters except for intermittent
guerrilla operations by various PLO factions every now and then here and there. What had
boosted Israel's confidence in the past was the fact that all previous wars with the Arabs
were no real wars. In 1948, Arab troops, mostly commanded by British officers, only
prepared the ground for the creation of Israel and the displacement of the bulk of the
Palestinian Arab population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1967, the Arabs were not in a mood for war and had not prepared the
least for it. Israel took the initiative while knowing the lack of willingness on the part
of the Arabs to engage it. In 1973, former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat embarked on what
initially was truly a glorious conquest of occupied Sinai only to effect tactical changes
in prelude to making a humiliating U.S.-brokered peace with Israel. <br>
The Intifada made a real difference. It exposed Israel's predicament and restored
confidence in the hearts of millions of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Furthermore, it
opened the eyes of many millions around the world to the cruelty and inhumanity of Israel.
When in response to the massacre of Palestinian civilians by Israeli troops or settlers
Hamas and Islamic Jihad introduced military tactics including 'martyrdom' bombings, the
Israelis sensed more trouble. Now we know how much concern that escalation in resistance
posed for the Israelis. We know more surely because of what has happened in South Lebanon.
Simply, Israelis cannot afford to die in combat. Someone else should die but not them. If
they are the ones that are excepted to pay, they'd rather relinquish their positions and
retreat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let us try for a moment to envisage what could have happened had the
Lebanese scenario been allowed to unfold in occupied Palestine. Like the Lebanese, the
Palestinians were prepared to continue the struggle despite the clear imbalance of power.
Like Hizbullah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad had the ability to recruit fighters whose love for
death in the cause of regaining their people's rights exceeded the Israelis' love for a
life of security, safety and comfort. As in the case of Hizbullah, Arabs and Muslims all
over the worlds sympathized with the Palestinian struggle and were prepared to support it
until it reaped its fruits. However, unlike the case of Lebanon, the Palestinian struggle
was stabbed in the back and betrayed from within. Israel was presented with a golden
opportunity by the ailing, corrupt and bankrupt PLO leadership. As a result of the 1993
Oslo agreement between the PLO and Israel, the task of securing Israel against Palestinian
<br>
reprisals has been undertaken by the forty thousand or so policemen and security agents
recruited by the Israeli-sponsored Palestinian Authority (PA). The PA deserves credit, and
has indeed been credited by the Israelis, for doing an excellent job hunting down
resistance members of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad murdering them, incarcerating them or
handing them over to Israel. It is also credited for opening the doors wide open before
Israel to establish relations with other Arab countries and with so many nations around
the world that until then had refrained from recognizing Israel in support of the PLO. Had
Israel not found a helping hand from the PLO, it might have had no option but to withdraw
unilaterally from the territories occupied in 1967. <br>
Intelligence sources say that at one time, Israeli politicians were seriously considering
an offer of truce by Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin according to which Hamas would cease
its military operations for an agreed period of time in exchange for a total Israeli
withdrawal from 1967-occupied territories, the release of all Palestinian prisoners and
the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Israel did not need to
spend much time considering that option when Yassir Arafat offered it peace of mind in
exchange for some trivial VIP concessions. <br>
Fortunately, it has not taken long for most Palestinians, including many of those who
initially welcomed the creation of the PA, to discover the truth. The PA has turned to be
nothing but a new Israeli agency of collaborators little different from the disintegrating
South Lebanese Lahd's army of collaborators. Year after year since its creation, and from
one round of negotiations to the other, the PA has signed away Palestinian rights. Aware
of the predicament it led itself into, the PA's response to the defeat of Israel in
Lebanon was a mix of disregard, indifference and denial. There is no clearer evidence than
the attempt by Yassir Arafat, PA leader, to uplift the morale of Israelis following the
most humiliating moment in the history of their state. As if nothing was happening in the
region, he flew to Europe to attend a football match between a European team and a joint
Israeli-Palestinian team in support of a peace process few people now believe in. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clearly embarrassed by Hizbullah's historic success, Arafat insisted in a
television interview that the Israelis withdrew from Lebanon not because of Hizbullah but
because of compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 425, an argument the Israelis
themselves found too good to believe and too feeble to present. Clearly Israel's defeat in
Lebanon was also a defeat for Yassir <br>
Arafat and his PA. In the fate of Lahd's army, Arafat and some of his lieutenants may have
seen the end of their unholy enterprise. Perhaps it is time for those of them who still
associate with the cause of their people to reconsider their positions before their PA is
no more just as Lahd's army is no more. <br>
Today Lebanon is free and tomorrow Palestine will be. This is the essence of the message
Hizbullah has sent to the Palestinians by awarding to them its victory.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>By Ramzy Baroud*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was a fierce battle at Rahwa location near the Israeli Jordanian
borders. Dozens of Palestinian and Jordanian fighters who defended the area were declared
dead as the military compound was transformed into the ashes of khaki tents, columns of
flames and human remains. On the day of 13 September 1956, the bodies of the Arab fighters
were unrecognizable. But since no survivors were reported, a large mass grave and the
naming of the fallen martyrs was all that was needed for that chapter to be closed. For
the families of the dead, the pain and the loss was never redeemed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What made the Rahwa battle more memorable than most of the tragic battles
fought at the time was the eye witness testimony of an Arab shepherd, who declared that
departing Israeli soldiers took one last survivor, blindfolded and handcuffed. Although
such testimony sparked a glow of hope, the passing of the years were enough to snuff it
out. Saleh al-Qaisyia was that captive who survived the Israeli raid by a miracle, yet the
slow death of 44 years inside Israeli prisons was the cruel alternative. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is difficult to be a prisoner of war. It is more difficult to be an
Arab prisoner of war in Israel, where your human rights have no value or place. But what
is much more difficult than all of that combined is being Saleh al-Qaisyia. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What drove Saleh&#146;s brother Muhammad al-Qaisyia to believe that his
brother had a better chance of being that captured solider is the fact that he came to the
location the day after the battle ended. When he arrived, he found a hat, a small handmade
hat laying away from the destroyed camp. He knew is his heart that it belonged to his
brother Saleh.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The story was aired live on a local Palestinian TV station, al-Majd, where
Saleh&#146;s brother, son and grandson retrieved that past. With tears and despair, they
told what they knew of the story. While the past appeared as vivid as an open book for
Saleh&#146;s brother, his son was only six months old when his father became a martyr. So
for him, the only memories remaining were those of the long journey of suffering he
endured to become a man without the love and care of a father. Yet he dreamt, like any
child growing up under the same circumstances, that his father was alive. The fantasy
became a reality one day when a man who escaped from an Israeli prison in the late 1960s
told the family that Saleh had been held in an Israeli prison since his capture. Yet with
few avenues available to investigate and Israeli&#146;s refusal to cooperate, that
revelation faded quietly. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While a Palestinian mother was waving goodbye to her son after their short
visit ended at the Askelon Israeli prison and was readying herself to head home, she saw
an old man sitting dressed in his prison uniform with a long white beard weeping alone.
After approaching and trying to comfort him, the old man lamented that his tears were
caused by being imprisoned for 44 years without his family knowing that he was alive. The
old man was named Saleh al-Qaisyia. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Saleh&#146;s story and tears were quickly disclosed to his family who
became firm believers that Saleh was the blindfolded soldier captured 44 years ago at
Rahwa. Days later, through the intervention of the Red Cross, Saleh&#146;s son was able to
hear loud and clear from the administrator of Israeli prisons that his father was alive. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet while the story still lacks a true happy ending, since Saleh is still
incarcerated and since two thirds of his life were spent away from his family in torture,
humiliation and loneliness, vital questions remain. How many Arab prisoners are secretly
held in Israel? How many of them passed away and were buried without their families even
knowing of their imprisonment? Why would a 70-year-old man be forbidden from meeting his
family? In fact, why is he still being held years after the signing of the peace treaty
with Jordan? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Saleh is a reflection of Israel&#146;s disregard for human life and
values, a fact that has not changed after the signing of many meaningless papers called
&#147;peace agreements&#148;. Most of us already know how Israel would react if Saleh was
an Israeli soldier held secretly for 44 years in Jordan or elsewhere. While we cannot
expect Israel to treat its enemies like its own people, we may have hoped that years of
handshakes would have brought about some change in Israel&#146;s inhumanity. Yet when
Saleh and thousands like him are enduring the worst in life and are used as bargaining
chips in Israel&#146;s manipulative peace schemes, we know that little has changed despite
the ceaseless talks about peace. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Military victory and the attainment of national
rights: <br>
from South Vietnam to South Lebanon</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The issue of Israel&#146;s withdrawal from southern Lebanon is no longer a
question of speculation. It is now only a matter of timing. Whether it takes place in July
or not seems unimportant to Lebanese and Palestinians alike. While it may not be as
dramatic as the humiliating American withdrawal from South Vietnam 25 years ago, the
historical significance of this event would not go unnoticed: that no military power,
however advanced technologically, can defeat a resolute people armed with faith in the
justice of their cause. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When it finally comes, Israel&#146;s withdrawal would be an unparalleled
victory for the Lebanese resistance. This shall be the first time that a resistance
movement would have forced the Jewish State to abandon occupied Arab lands. From a
different position, Palestinians may rightly perceive the withdrawal as a victory. For
although the 1982 Operation Peace for Galilee was intended to &#147;rid South Lebanon of
its Palestinian population&#148;, the military occupation that followed failed to
accomplish this. The &#147;transfer&#148; of Palestinians, which Menachem Begin suggested
to a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee in June 1982, has since
proved more difficult than expected.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Traditionally speaking, Lebanon has always been a place where the
region&#146;s weak and oppressed sought refuge. Christians who left the Orthodox Church
and adopted Roman Catholicism found refuge there in the eighteenth century. Two hundred
years later, Armenians fleeing Turkish massacres also ended up in Lebanon. Others included
Kurds, Chaldeans and Assyrians from Iraq, albeit in smaller numbers. None of these
arrivals compared in size and impact to that of the 125,000 Palestinians who entered
Lebanon in 1948. As their number multiplied to over 400,000 during the past five decades,
they have on account of their religious identity and national cause determined the
direction of Lebanon&#146;s political discourse more than any other exile group. This was
helped by the fact that unlike other countries in the Middle East where political power is
wielded by army officers and influential families, consensus and the balance of sectarian
interests have been the guiding forces behind Lebanese politics. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Race for the camps</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The search for consensus in Lebanon was not only determined by conflicts
between competing confessional communities. It was also defined by conflicts within
individual communities as they fought to overthrow ruling elites and install new power
brokers. With regard to the Palestinians, this latter factor appears to be one of the most
important that may make this summer the longest and hottest in Lebanon&#146;s modern
history. The telltale signs of a struggle for the camps have become increasingly clear
during the last nine months as Syria and the PLO jockeyed for position of leadership over
the camps.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When a Lebanese military court condemned Sultan Abu al-Aynen, a Fateh
leader and Secretary General of the PLO in Lebanon, to death in October 1999 for leading
an armed group and trafficking in arms, tensions in and around the Palestinian refugee
camps in southern Lebanon rose automatically. One reason is that unlike other countries in
the region where they took refuge, the Palestinians in Lebanon had, after decades in the
camps, successfully transformed themselves from a stream of defenseless refugees into an
ocean of armed combatants. The clearest manifestation of this was the November 1969 Cairo
Agreement between the PLO and the Lebanese authorities which enabled them to administer
the camps and maintain an armed presence there in return for respect of Lebanese
sovereignty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, as Israel prepares to withdraw from occupied southern Lebanon, the
central government in Beirut has come under increasing pressure to disarm the Fateh
factions in the camps. The contradictory signals from the administration have not helped
matters. While President Lahoud openly espoused the disarming of the camps, other
officials favour a pro-Syrian leadership that will probably take the fight to Israel. The
second sentencing of Abu al-Aynen in April to prison for collaborating with Israel is seen
by many as an attempt to increase the pressure on Fateh loyalists. In the event of this
happening, the latter have vowed to defend their positions. For its part, the PLO
leadership has repeated, time and again, that the refugee issue is a Palestinian one and
only the Palestinian leadership can speak on their behalf. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Admittedly, the apparent lack of chemistry and trust between Presidents
Arafat and Assad has obstructed Arab coordination on the refugees, especially after Syria
became militarily embroiled in Lebanon in 1976. Despite their claim of support for the
refugees&#146; right to return, Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss confessed in a recent
interview (<i>Shu&#146;un al Awsat</i>, February 2000) that there is no coordination
between the Arab parties on the matter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By demanding the disarmament of the camps and expansion of a UN
peacekeeping role in southern Lebanon, Beirut has unwittingly played into the hands of the
Israelis. The latter believe that this arrangement would prevent the south from remaining
a war zone after withdrawal. Having failed to obtain any such security guarantees from
Lebanon and Syria, military strategists in Israel fear their Prime Minister is leading
them into a trap. It is in this context Tel Aviv has called upon America to use its
influence in the Security Council to create an expanded military role for the UN in south
Lebanon. Its main task would be to prevent the Palestinians from infiltrating or using
southern Lebanon as a base to launch attacks from across the border. This was, after all,
the <i>raison d&#146;�tre</i> of the occupation. While disarmament may be the surest way
to preempt this, attempts to implement it militarily may turn out to be a bloody and
costly affair, especially if Israel&#146;s surrogate South Lebanon Army is allowed to hold
on to its weapons.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a related matter, the Lebanese argue that conditions in the camps
should remain as they are because improvements would amount to a form of naturalization.
This position is untenable because there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in
Europe and the Americas who live in dignity and still have not given up their right to
return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whatever measures the Jewish State adopts to deal with the Palestinian
presence in Lebanon, nothing short of repatriation has the slightest chance of succeeding.
The Israeli Ministry of Defense nevertheless has other ideas. It recently approved the
construction of a 40-kilometre wall along its northern border with Lebanon. In the age of
internet communication, it seems utterly ludicrous that the Jewish State should resort to
the erection of a Berlin-type wall in order to prolong the division and exile of the
Palestinian people. The sad irony of this situation is the same democratic States that
supported the reunion of Soviet Jewish families during the Cold War are the very nations
who today oppose the reunification of Palestinian families. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Military defeat and political bankruptcy</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s humiliating military defeat in south Lebanon has spawned a
virus of political bankruptcy among its ruling elite, hawks and doves alike. Shimon Peres,
the pre-eminent dove and author of the New Middle East project, recently entered the
debate concerning the withdrawal agenda and its impact on the peace negotiations. Like the
rest of the Tel Aviv establishment, he joined the campaign for the postponement of
negotiations on the issue of refugees (<i>Ha&#146;aretz</i>, 1 May 2000). He argues that
since there is no likelihood of a solution in the immediate future there would be no harm
in postponing discussions of the issue. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, there would be no harm for those who do not live in the
derelict concrete huts that shelter dark memories of bloody massacres with stench from the
sewers and rats that roam the garbage heaps. Britain&#146;s prize-winning journalist,
Robert Fisk admitted, &#147;If I lived there, I always think, I&#146;d go mad.&#148; From
Nahr el-Bared in the north to Rashedieh in the south, Lebanon&#146;s 12 Palestinian
refugee camps are saturated with guns and pent-up anger. Shoot-outs are commonplace both
within and without the camps. This is one of the forgotten parts of the world where 40% of
the children leave school before the age of 11 and 60% of the workforce is unemployed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As far as the Lebanese are concerned, asking them to permanently resettle
hundreds of thousand of Palestinians seems unfair as well as impracticable. Lebanon simply
does not have the capacity to absorb the refugees. It has, besides, yet to recover from
its 15-year civil war. More than 450,000 of its own citizens fled the country during the
period 1975-1990. It is inconceivable, therefore, how the government will balance their
return with the resettlement of the Palestinians. With a gross domestic product (GDP) of
$16 billion and an external debt that exceeds $20 billion, most of the country&#146;s
earnings go toward interest payments. Yet, friendly countries that are larger and richer
than Lebanon continue to pressure it to naturalize 400,000 Palestinians while they cringe
at the prospect of accommodating 4,000 refugees from the Balkans. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the absence of genuine incentives, Palestinians must remain
hopeful that good sense, probity and justice will eventually prevail. That elected
governments in the world&#146;s leading democracies will respond positively to the call of
the 103<sup>rd</sup> International Parliamentary Union Conference, which met recently in
Jordan and unanimously called for the Palestinian right of return, according to United
Nations resolution 194. And, that they would, likewise, respond to the United Nations
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) meeting in Paris which also called for Palestinian
repatriation. As a leading member of the international community and a global power with
historic ties and interests in the Middle East, much attention is now being focused on the
British government. Indeed, observers are waiting for the autumn when the European
Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into the United Kingdom&#146;s law. This
event, widely seen as the most significant constitutional change in Britain since the 1688
Bill of Rights, will open mechanisms for the legal debate of unresolved historical issues.
These are expected to cover a spectrum that extends from Britain&#146;s involvement in the
African slave trade to its creation of Jewish Israel in Arab Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian refugees in Lebanon have, over the years, displayed great
resilience, restraint and courage. They survived attempted genocide and numerous crimes of
war. They defied the prognosis of those who assumed that the expulsion of the PLO&#146;s
leadership from Lebanon would break their will and bury their cause. They continue to live
for the return. This objective is one of the few remaining certainties in their daily
lives. Their social, cultural and human identity revolves around it. Despite efforts to
reduce it to the level of a political demand that can be traded in the negotiations of
unequal partners, it remains for them a legitimate and inalienable right that must be part
of a just peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With over 400,000 Palestinians exiled in Lebanon, Israel&#146;s decision
to withdraw from South Lebanon can only produce a temporary lull in hostilities. It can
lay no claim to a final settlement or closure of the Palestinian file. Any attempt to
legitimize Palestinian exile would, just as night follows day, give rise to a new
leadership that will champion the cause of return.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestine&#146;s Rejection of the UN Partition
Plan</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shihadeh*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I would like to examine here the much talked about Israeli myth that the
Palestinian tragedy was a result of their rejection of United Nations resolution 181
outlining the Partition of Palestine. In other words, what would have happened had the
Palestinians and the Arabs accepted the UN Partition Plan of resolution 181? Would Israel
have implemented it in good faith?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To keep Israel&#146;s image unblemished in the eyes of the world and to
dismiss the contention that Israel was born in sin, Zionist apologists blame all the
tragedies that befell the Palestinians on their rejection of the UN Partition Plan as
embodied in resolution 181 of 29 November 1947. Such a theme would cloak Israel with
importantly needed morality, justify Israel&#146;s atrocities, massacres and the uprooting
of the Palestinians in the war of 1947-1948 in order to take over their lands. In
retrospect then, the Zionists claim that if the Palestinians accepted the UN Partition
Plan as the Zionist leadership did, none of the miseries of 1947-1948 would have taken
place&#150;no wars, no victims, no refugees, no land expropriations&#150;and the two
peoples would have enjoyed peaceful co-existence for the last 50 years! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the risk of intruding into the realm of speculations, let me explore
the possibilities that could have evolved had the Palestinians and the Arabs accepted the
UN resolution in its entirety, assuming of course that the Zionists accepted it also in
good faith. To minimize the speculative approach, one has to understand that when the UN
Partition was adopted on 29 November 1947, the combined ownership of land by Jewish
organizations did not exceed 7% of Palestine while the Jewish population (even with all
the illegal massive Jewish immigration) was inferior to that of the Palestinians at a
ratio of 1:2 (records of the UN Commission on Palestine, JNF records, the Israeli
custodian of absentee properties established 1950, and the new historians). Add to this
status quo the fact that the UN Partition Plan (resolution 181), which divided Palestine
into 55% Jewish and 45% Arab, prohibited any forced transfer of any inhabitant from either
sector to the other. This means that the lands in the Jewish State would have been owned
by Arabs while the majority of its inhabitants would have been Arabs, too. Calling this
type of State a Jewish one would have become a practice in theatrics. How and where would
Israel settle hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees waiting in European camps to
immigrate to the newly born Jewish State?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To justify the creation of a Jewish State, many Zionist apologists claim
that the demographic ratio was not in favour of the Arabs in the Jewish sector of the UN
Partition, but it was in the ratio of 55% Jewish and 45% Palestinians. Assuming for the
sake of argument that this ratio was true, it was also true that the Arab birth rate was
much higher than the Jewish birth rate. Simple calculations would bring the Arab
population to a much higher ratio in less than a generation. Nowadays, the Arab population
in Israel Proper is close to a million from a number of 150,000 that were left behind in
the 1947-1948 war. This shows that an increase of the Arab population multiplied almost
sevenfold in the period of the last 50 years. If those refugees of around 850,000 were not
forced to leave (since everybody would have accepted the UN Partition as we premised
above), then the number who would have remained in Israel Proper would be almost a million
(150,000 + 850,000 evicted refugees). Therefore, multiplying this number by seven in
accordance with the above ratio would have brought the Palestinian population to 7 million
which would be twice the entire Jewish population of today. This means that keeping this
State a Jewish State until today would have become a farce. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If, however, the early Zionist plans were unveiled prior to the
establishment of the State of Israel and if what had taken place on the ground were
objectively compared to these plans, one would have to come to the inescapable conclusion
that most of the Israeli premeditated plans were to violate resolution 181 in favour of
acquiring as much land as possible while evicting the indigenous Palestinians from the
same lands. (Let&#146;s keep in mind here that the UN Partition Plan divided Palestine
into roughly 55% to the Jewish State and 45% to the Arab State, even though the Arabs
owned at least 90% of the land and represented a two-thirds majority of the population. I
would also like to point out here that the UN Partition prohibited the forced transfer of
any inhabitant from any sector to the other.) Assuming then that Israel was genuine and
honest about accepting the UN Partition, the long-sought objective of establishing a
Jewish State would become a farce, since anyway you divide it, Palestine had a majority
Arab population. It would be very hard to believe that a Jewish State would be named as
such if the majority of the inhabitants in that sector would be non-Jewish. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding the above, let us assume that a democratic Jewish State
was established. In this case, the Arab majority would vote Arab representatives into the
Jewish Parliament and an Arab for the Prime Minister; after all, no one can deny that in a
free democratic society the majority rule. Aside from the name, the Jewish State would be
in effect an Arab government with the majority of its inhabitants being also Arabs. Since
the UN Partition stipulates very clearly that no one from either sector would be
dispossessed from his land, except for the common welfare, there would be no place for new
Jewish immigrants as most of the land was under Arab ownership and control. Therefore, the
UN Partition, if implemented honestly, would make the establishment of a Jewish State in
Palestine nearly an impossible Jewish dream. Therefore, to cling persistently to the
actual establishment of a viable Jewish State, two preconditions had to be fulfilled: the
expropriation of land from the indigenous Arabs and the creation of a system under which
the Arab majority would become a minority. Since it would be ludicrous, if not insane, to
expect anybody volunteering to give up his land and property and exchange that for the
status of becoming a miserable refugee, somebody else had to do the job. In order for the
Zionist leadership, then, to establish the Jewish State in a land whose majority of people
and land were Arab, it had to use force to evict the Arabs and take over their land and
properties as there was no other way indeed as many Jewish sources confirm. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Simha Flapan, Benny Morris, Ilan Pappe, Professor N. Neuberger and Norman
Finkelstein are a few of the Israeli historians who confirm such a view, and that the
uprooting of the Palestinians was the implementation of a premeditated plan with the
Zionist leadership as far back as 1930, when even Ben-Gurion himself favoured the transfer
of Palestinians out in order to create a viable Jewish State. Mr. Yoram Ben Porath (JNF)
and a Zionist leader exposes this further when he, on 14 July 1972 (Yediot Aaronoth),
stated that there is not such a thing as Zionism, or colonization by the Jewish State
without the eviction of the Arabs and the expropriation of their lands! Haim Weizman
(Exile and Return, page 117) confirms a similar view when he stated that Israel should be
as Jewish as England is English! Joseph Weitz, Deputy Chairman of the JNF (1951-1973)
stated as early as 1940:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Among ourselves it must be clear that there is no place in the country for
    both peoples together...With the Arabs we shall not achieve our aim of being independent
    people in this country. The only solution is Eretz Israel, at least the west part of Eretz
    Israel, without Arabs...and there is no other way but to transfer the Arabs from here to
    the neighbouring countries, transfer all of them, not one village or tribe should remain,
    and the transfer must be aimed at Iraq, Syria and even Transjordan. For this purpose money
    will be found, much money; and only with this transfer could the country absorb millions
    of our brothers. There is no other alternative...One should investigate now the
    neighbouring countries in order to determine their capacity to absorb the Arabs of Eretz
    Israel.&#148;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s no wonder, therefore, that plans like Nachsen, Misparayim,
Galilee, Dalet and others were prepared before the war to cleanse the Arabs from the
entire Jewish sector. It was no wonder that massacres and uprooting took place in Deir
Yassin, Haifa, Jaffa, Safad, W. Jerusalem and hundreds of others to make sure that the
Jewish State became indeed very Jewish! Mr. Rabin in his memoirs has also confirmed how he
participated in the eviction of almost 60,000 unprotected Arab civilians in Lud and Ramleh
after surrendering to the Zionist forces. He ordered that they start walking toward the
East, women, children and the elderly! We all have read history of wars which established
an undeniable fact that most occupiers take over the control of the country with their
military presence, but how many would evict the indigenous people and replace them with
people if their own? In Palestine the Zionists could not create a Jewish State when the
majority of the people were not Jewish, as stated by the Israeli historian Benny Morris:
&#147;Any way you divide it, you would have a fifth column&#148;, in an interview with the
associated press (16 December 1997 with Dan Perry).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Again, if the Zionist claim is true, that the eviction took place because
of the Palestinian rejection to the UN Partition, why would Israel practice similar
evictions when the war was over and everybody was settled? Can Israeli history deny the
expulsion of the inhabitants of Ikrit in Western Galilee and the village of Rama in 1949?
Can Israel deny that on 5 November 1949 they evicted, by force, the inhabitants of Kfar
Anan from their homes and were forced to cross the borders into the West Bank? How about
the forced evictions of 700 inhabitants from Kfar Yusuf on 28 February 1951&#150;long
after the 1948 war&#150;who were loaded onto trucks and dumped on the Jordanian borders.
Should we thank the Israelis for supplying the transportation? Actually, in February of
1951 alone, the inhabitants of more than 13 villages were transported out of their homes
and dumped across the Jordanian borders! Do all these forced evictions lend any
credibility to the Israeli claim that it was not within the Zionist plans to evict the
Palestinians? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A further proof of Zionist immoral history in Palestine is the Israeli
practices in the West Bank. The expropriation of lands, the evictions, the demolitions and
the military cruel rule do not point to the illegal and immoral behaviour of the Zionists
alone, but they do confirm the evil practices of the past. Using the same logic now, are
we to be evicted further because we are rejecting the further partitioning of whatever is
left of our homes and land? Are we to be &#147;punished&#148; again by further evictions
for rejecting to be evicted? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was normal for the Palestinians as much as for any people on this earth
to reject the UN Partition, which allots the best part of their land to foreign intruders,
but what is not normal is to &#147;punish&#148; them so severely for such a normal
attitude by disinheriting them and turning them into tragic refugees. To claim that Israel
should not accept them back in conformity with so many UN resolutions, including the UN
Partition, because they might pose a fifth column is an exercise in theatrics, because
those Arabs who stayed did not become a fifth or a fourth column for that matter. The hard
core fact is that Israel was born in sin, and it has robbed the indigenous Palestinians of
their homes and properties and then claimed to the world in a very obvious chutzpah that
it was the Palestinian&#146;s fault. It&#146;s like the convicted thief who does not stop
stealing but resents being called a thief. It should behoove Israel and its allies to
realize that success in fooling the world would not bring it any closer to any real peace,
as the proof lies in the non-peaceful status quo. To address the victims and to tell the
truth of what has taken place might be the only first step toward real peace.</p>

thoughts of a Palestinian Islamist</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khaled Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The image of Islam in the West has always been negative owing to
historical and religious reasons. Many excellent academic works explain this very
satisfactorily.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In &#147;Chanson de Roland&#148;, the great medieval French epic of the
wars between Christians and Muslims, the Christian poet envisioned the religion of Islam
as a trinity consisting of the Prophet Muhammed and two other entities&#150;both of them
devils&#150;Appolin and Tervagant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This conceptualization of Muslims and their religion, comic and fabulous
as it is, was nonetheless typical of the manner in which Christian Europe viewed Islam and
Muslims. Interestingly enough, some of these perceptions have lingered in some form or
other to this day.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, since 1948, the mostly Zionist-controlled or Zionist-influenced media
in the West have deliberately besmirched the image of Arabs and Muslims. And the reason
for that is the Zionist conviction that &#147;image&#148; must be part of the conflict
between the Arabs and the Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists thought, politically rightly, that if they wanted to defeat
the Arabs, kill them, arrogate and usurp their land, then they should begin with
demonizing and vilifying their image; this is what Hollywood and the so-called
agenda-setters of the Western media have been doing for the last five decades.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists learned this from the Nazis. Hence the numerous anti-Arab,
anti-Islamic, hate-filled movies, such as the recent Hollywood film &#147;Rules of
Engagement&#148;, can be considered replicas of Hitler&#146;s &#147;Mein Kamph&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, the Zionists are launching a vitriolic campaign of vilification
against Islam and the contemporary Islamic movements, seeking to rescue the Muslim world
from the claws of despotism and political, economic and cultural subservience to Western
hegemony.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, they focus on anecdotal examples here and there, claiming that this
is Islam...and this is how an Islamic State would look like.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Very often they would cite the Taliban Movement, ignoring the fact that
Islam&#146;s real potentials can&#146;t really appear in an environment infested with
illiteracy, poverty and ignorance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Iran seems to be a different story. Yes, in the first few years of the
revolution, things were very unpleasant. Sadeq Khalkhali (the hanging judge) was the
symbol!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But now Iran is in a state of labour, and everybody hopes that the
&#147;newborn&#148; will be an Islamic, democratic and civil Islamic society, where all
citizens enjoy the full protection of the law irrespective of their faiths.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this wouldn&#146;t be a new invention as the Islamic civil society
was encapsulated and embodied through the &#147;constitution of Medina&#148; in the first
days of Islam, where Muslims, Christians, Jews and even polytheists lived together as
&#147;citizens&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The &#147;re-institution&#148; of the Political Islamic authority is not a
&#147;philosophical end&#148; <i>per se</i>. It is rather a means that would lead to a
much hoped-for end, and that end is the restoration of &#147;normalcy and civility&#148;
to the Muslim world, lost with the collapse of the Islamic caliphate.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just imagine what we have been going through. A hundred years of Ottoman
stagnation, a hundred years of European colonization (virtually all Arab and Muslim
countries were raped by European powers), and then came those despotic police States,
which are still around, tormenting us and killing our humanity. So, we are like orphans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Muslims are the victims everywhere&#150;victims of foreign powers and
victims of their own ignorance and disintegration&#150;such as Bosnia, Kosovo, Palestine,
Lebanon, Kashmir and Chechnya, to name a few.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We experienced all kinds of ideologies and isms: Pan Arab nationalism,
communism, Ba&#146;athism, territorial nationalism, and all of them have been gigantic
fiascos.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, the bulk of the masses in the Arab world would like to reinstitute
the Islamic rule, not in order to subjugate non-Muslims, not in order to suffocate human
rights and civil liberties (which virtually don&#146;t exist anyway), and certainly not in
order to establish a new form of despotism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The goal is &#147;dignity, civil liberties, human rights, and above all
freedom.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Frankly, we feel the West (particularly the U.S.) is against this because
they are afraid that allowing democracy to take root in the Arab world would eventually
produce rulers that are hostile to Western economic and geopolitical interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel, of course, is the number-one enemy of democracy in the Arab
world...since a democratic Arab world would acquire strength, and Arab strength is
inherently not in Zionism&#146;s favour.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, what do we exactly want?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like anybody else, we, Muslims, want democracy, human rights, civil
liberties, the rule of law, and a higher standard of living (BUT) without losing our
human, religious and cultural values.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, we don&#146;t want democracy without Islam, and we
won&#146;t accept Islam without democracy. In any case, Islam is anything but despotic, so
what we aspire for is the reinstitution of the authentic Islam, the Islam of Shura,
justice, equality and tolerance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We don&#146;t want to see anybody attack Islam in the name of liberty, but
likewise, we won&#146;t like to see anybody attack liberty in the name of Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, if Islam has a bad name in the West, should we just shove it away to
gain acceptance in the West?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, does democracy have to be secular? What is secular? Is the U.S.
secular? Is Europe secular?And can&#146;t there be Islamic democrats as there are
Christian democrats?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And why does the world tolerate Shas, Agudat Yisrael, the Mifdal, Yahdut
Hatorha, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart, Pat Robertson and so on and yet shakes at the mere
appearance of an Islamic political party? Doesn&#146;t that indicate that the West is not
really interested in democracy...but rather something else, namely imperialism and
hegemony?</p>

undermines progress toward Statehood</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ray Hanania*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When I was a young Palestinian, the &#147;fight&#148; was so much easier.
We (the Palestinians in the United States) were all together. We worked together and we
fought together. We celebrated together and we cried together.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, all that has changed. It&#146;s not that we have changed. We
haven&#146;t. The Arabs in America are as confused today as they were 25 years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But what has changed is that our people back home are divided. And the
fact is Palestinian Americans are a mere reflection of their people back home. Why are we
divided?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, when we were victims of a blanket Israeli policy of repression, we
were all suffering. And the issue wasn&#146;t how to make peace, but rather how to force
the Israelis to recognize us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now that we have achieved our initial demands, we find ourselves divided.
Divided in Palestine. And divided in the Diaspora.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I will be honest with you. I don&#146;t enjoy the new reality. In one
sense, I miss those days when we were all together, fighting against a clearly
identifiable danger. Everyone was against us. It wasn&#146;t like we could argue about who
we could talk to or not talk to.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, it&#146;s very different. And we see it in the confrontations that
now exist between our own people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sadly, both sides seem to be uncompromising. The PA is as harsh against
its own people as the Israelis. And the critics of the PA are as harsh against their own
people, too.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Someone needs to explain to our people that Democracy is not a systematic
and clearly defined process. It is an evolution of freedom, meaning that as the process
evolves, we all get better at it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most egregious crimes of the PA are so blatant and avoidable it&#146;s
pathetic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most important principle of true Democracy is the ability to be able
to speak out and say whatever you want. It doesn&#146;t matter how caustic the criticism.
The expression of one&#146;s views is as inalienable to Democracy as the Palestinian right
to national self-determination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA officials are undermining their own goals by responding harshly to
their critics by censoring them, imprisoning them and even beating them, and that includes
their subordinates, such as the commissions and agencies they control. A good example is
the so-called appointed Palestinian Bar Council which is applying one of the most
ridiculous provisions to expel lawyers who are critical of PA policies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the founders of Democracy have many other problems, they have
learned one thing: criticism is the measure of strength. The harsher the criticism and
your ability to withstand and tolerate criticism, the stronger you are morally.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Criticism of the PA should be a mark of strength, not a cause for
weakness. Instead of the tactics they are using, the PA should respond with reason.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the United States, we refer to the PA&#146;s unfortunate practices as
tyranny of the majority. And when a majority becomes tyrannical, it suggests that the
confidence they should have in themselves and their policies are weak.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let me explain it another way: if you are confident of what you are doing,
you don&#146;t need to overreact when criticized.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The overreaction is, in effect, a reflection of weakness on the part of
the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, this principle also applies to those who attack the PA, too.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most unreasonable of the PA&#146;s critics are the academics who
dominate most of the major organizations, more commonly referred to as the NGOs. These
organizations are a hotbed of unfair criticism, distorted analysis and, frequently,
selfishly motivated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Academics rely on the word of the textbook. And those who live by the
purist view of the world are the ones who are out of touch with reality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The NGOs claim to represent the grass-roots Palestinians, but the fact is
few have real memberships or constituencies. Most NGOs are established by individuals who
have created mini-empires that preserve their power indefinitely. Some NGO presidents are
like the leaders of many Arab world governments, tyrannical
&#147;presidents-for-life&#148; who care first and foremost for their own survival and,
only after, about the foundation of their ideals.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, the fact that the NGOs are poorly organized, undemocratic (none are
elected by real constituencies) and, to be brutally frank, incompetent and ineffective is
not a reason for the PA to apply equally unjustified and unreasonable responses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You can measure the ineffectiveness of the NGOs by using computers to scan
their impact on the American media. Search the archives and you will find so little you
wonder if they exist. The standard response to this fact is that the &#147;media is
controlled by Jews&#148;, a fallacy that many Arab dictators have used to explain away
their own failures.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact is, the NGOs should be concerned about swaying American and
foreign public opinion, the standard method of influencing politics in democracies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But since the NGOs are not democracies themselves, they don&#146;t seem to
care that the media has totally ignored their activities and view their spokespeople as
inconsequential players.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sadly, this struggle between the NGOs and the PA dominates the Palestinian
evolution toward true Democracy and freedom.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It requires intelligent and reasonable people to recognize this fault and
set aside their petty differences and childish policies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As we move toward the establishment of Palestinian Statehood, we should be
seeking ways to work together. Certainly, if the two sides in this drama could find a way
to work together, we might realize greater concessions from the Israelis, who are keenly
aware that these internal Palestinian struggles undermine our bargaining strength.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Does Israel Really Want Peace?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Fatima Hamilton</em></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel says it wants peace. It makes a big song and dance every now and
then with the U.S. as a mediator or some other party. Yet, what &#147;peace&#148; have
they achieved? They normalized relations with Egypt, Jordan and other Arab and Muslim
countries, but this is not really peace. It is peace on paper. The two peoples&#150;Arabs
and Jews&#150;have been enemies for centuries, and it is not something either can easily
forget. Zionism is the same as racism and even akin to Nazism. The Israeli Zionist thinks
he is superior to all other people. Even he makes the Christians believe this, in order to
gain their support, by emphasizing that they are the &#147;Chosen People.&#148; Their
racist creed is one wedge that is keeping peace from existing. Also, the Arabs will never
forget what happened to Palestinians in the past and what is happening now. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Israel really wanted to achieve peace it could&#151;both with
Palestinians and other Arabs. Yet, they really do not like peace. It is evident in their
Zionist philosophy, which sparks hatred and war, and in their recent bombings in Beirut
and South Lebanon. They claim they are going to pull out of South Lebanon this coming
summer. If this is so, then isn&#146;t it strange that they say, on the one hand, they are
willing to leave the trouble-zone (which is the cause of the problem between the two
peoples) then, on the other hand, they bomb the country? This shows us just how much they
really desire peace!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also, the Israelis have nuclear weapons, which they tried to hide from the
rest of the world for years. Even they have refused to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
They want even more nuclear weapons. Why do they need all these weapons? Who do they plan
to fight? Their nearest neighbours do not even have this technology (and Iraq has been
crippled). So, why the need for nuclear weapons? It is not for defense. So, what are they
planning for in the future? This also does not work towards peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If we look at the past, we find that Israel inflicted atrocities on many
Palestinian villages such as Deir Yassin, where they cut open the stomachs of pregnant
women. Then they took all the dead bodies and stuffed them in a well. Also, they carried
out the same barbaric acts in Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon. What kind of humans can do
such barbaric and atrocious acts? Are these people who love peace? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As far as the Palestinian peace process goes, we have seen it put off and
delayed so many times. Will it ever come through? And if it does, will it be a real peace
settlement? No! No, it will create a peace on paper while the Palestinians will get the
short end of the stick, as usual. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Israel wanted peace, then it would stop building more settlements in
Palestinian areas and obey United Nations resolutions that restrict such building. Yet,
Israel has never obeyed a UN resolution (and there are many against them). They do not
respect the UN. They are building a new large settlement beside Jerusalem, which will
later be used to take away another part of Jerusalem from the Palestinians. The UN wanted
to declare Jerusalem an international city for the three faiths: Judaism, Christianity and
Islam. However, Israel does not agree nor does it respect other religions. It declares
Jerusalem to be its capital, and America has even agreed with this. They are also trying
to destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque (the third holiest mosque for Muslims) by digging under it and
weakening its structure in order to find the ruins of Solomon&#146;s Temple. Yet, they
have found nothing to prove that Solomon&#146;s Temple rested there. They even set fire to
the mosque but it was saved. This angers not only Palestinians but also all Muslims. The
Israelis have no respect for a place of worship, which happens to be centuries old. They
are picking the fight. Are these the actions of peace-loving people? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dr. Mahdi Dajani, lawyer and political writer, spoke on Nile TV&#146;s
&#147;Frontline&#148; (2 May 2000) about the peace process and the impediments to peace.
He spoke of new settlements being built around Tulkaram and Galilee (and even inside
Galilee). These settlements, he says, will later be used as bargaining chips in dividing
the land. The ridiculous part is the fact that because of Israel&#146;s racism, they will
make life more difficult on Palestinians through segregation. In Galilee, Palestinians
cannot walk in some streets near the Israeli settlement and this means that an owner
cannot even get to his shop to run it. How will these people support their families? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The so-called future Palestinian State will not even be a State. Dr. Mahdi
says that because of these new settlements (which are being built at a fast rate)
Palestinians will be isolated from each other and the planned future Palestinian State
will be just several &#147;islands&#148; that collectively will be called a State. What
kind of illogical process is this? Why would Palestinians accept this? It is meant to
destroy them and to keep them separated as well as to try to destroy the rest of their
identity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is Israel&#146;s cruel plan. They keep delaying and thereby buying
time so they can build more settlements in order to get what they want, which is to
destroy a people. They do not look for peace and they do not respect other human beings or
their rights. This is seen by the fact that they use torture on prisoners, which is legal
according to their own laws. Human rights violations abound within Israel. Yet, America
calls such cruel people their friend. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why is it that Iraq, Iran, Cuba, Serbia, Korea, Vietnam and China have
been punished for possessing nuclear weapons or reprimanded for human rights violations
while Israel remains unscathed in the face of documented crimes against humanity? </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Arjan El Fassed</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let&#146;s start with an easy question: What is your nationality?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Imagine if the answer was Palestinian. Suppose, for a second, you were
born in Palestine. You were born on the land of your father and forefathers, since time
immemorial. You were not an emigrant nor were you an alien to the land, a stranger to its
people, or a settler, who came to the country. Your family and culture were rooted to its
soil. Their homes and farms were their own. You planted your orchards. You established the
mosques and the churches. The towns and villages were their toil and the sweat of your
ancestors. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your life all revolves around this one place. You love the land and its
people. It might not be perfect, but it&#146;s the place you call &#145;home&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To start with, at least. Maybe you work hard for education. (Maybe you
don&#146;t even get the chance to get an education.) Let&#146;s say you go on to get a
degree. You find yourself a well-paid job as a doctor or a teacher or an engineer. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You get married. You&#146;ve got everything you ever wanted. The smart
car, the nice house, maybe even a couple of fantastic kids. And then, suddenly, your
entire life is ripped away from you.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps you were living in Jaffa and you remember the orange groves.
It&#146;s the city you can see but not return to. It is so near but yet so far,
you&#146;re now outside its borders, lost in a limitless exile.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps you&#146;re a farmer. Your family have tilled the same soil for
six generations. You&#146;ve got a small herd of cows, some goats, a few chickens and a
couple of fields that provide wheat for flour and straw for animal feed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You&#146;re afraid of the attacks and violence. You heard of what they had
done in Qazaza, Sa&#146;sa, Deir Yassin, and they continued in Lajjun, Saris and Tiberias.
Your choice was between saving your life or dying. They targeted the whole area where you
live for an &#145;ethnic cleansing&#146; programme. Basically, this meant emptying the
land of its people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The neighbours were saying that they were going to do to us what they had
done in Deir Yassin. They had surrounded the village and were about to enter it. You were
frightened, terribly frightened.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You lie on your belly watching helplessly as scores of heavily armed men
fan out across your field. They burn your wheat crop to the ground. They kill all your
livestock. They take your sons captive and took them away. There were bodies scattered on
the road and between the homes and down the side streets. No one, not even women or
children, had been spared if they were out in the street. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They round up all the local men (those who aren&#146;t killed defending
their homes and families), drive them to the outskirts of town and shoot them into an open
trench.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then silence. Except for the sound of your own breathing. Your own
heartbeat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They went on towards town and village, systematically searching each and
every home. Anybody they find was dragged outside, beaten and forced to flee.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s time to escape. You&#146;re going to leave behind your home,
your family, your friends, your career, your country. Everything you&#146;ve ever known.
Throw yourself on the mercy of some strangers in a far-off distant land&#150;far away from
the violence, the murder, the destruction. By the thousands they fled: North to Lebanon
and Syria, south to Gaza, east to Arab Palestine or on to Jordan. Your life was turned
upside down. You were faced with disease, lack of food and water, life in unfamiliar
places and overcrowding. All in all, you lost your homes, farms, family and lives. Many
crowded into refugee camps in tents. Others lived in caves or in the open. All hoped that
they would soon be able to return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps you didn&#146;t flee but stayed under occupation. Suppose you were
a journalist. You write a newspaper article criticizing the oppression of your people. And
you&#146;re immediately branded a criminal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The occupation forces kick down your door at 2 a.m. and arrest you. They
take you to a cell where you are held for a week, without trial, without access to a
solicitor, without the right to even one phone call.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How are you treated? Every four hours they beat you. Or maybe they whip
you with electric flex wire. Or maybe they just won&#146;t let you sleep. Or maybe they
administer electric shocks to your lips, tongue, eyelids and genitals.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>What are the names of your friends?&#148; You say there
aren&#146;t any. They don&#146;t believe you. They torture you. You say there aren&#146;t
any. They don&#146;t believe you. They torture you. You say there aren&#146;t any. They
don&#146;t believe you. They torture you. You black out from the pain.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Or maybe, just maybe, your torturers decide to let you go. On one
condition: You must report to the police station once a week. And once a week, when you
show up, you&#146;re beaten again. Or they pay somebody else to beat you up. Or they
follow you everywhere. Or you and your family start to receive death threats, by post and
phone. When does the torture stop? It doesn&#146;t. They could kill you at any time, but
they don&#146;t. First they want to make an example of you. Torture you psychologically,
terrorize your children, harass your family, threaten your friends. Make your life a
living hell.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even now, few people appreciate what the Palestinians have experienced or
how reduced their prospects are compared with what they have lost. They know what home is.
It&#146;s the thing that is lost, the awaited return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Home is not a map, nor a birth certificate. It&#146;s, as Darwish wrote,
&#147;Your life and your cause bound up together. And before and after all of that,
it&#146;s the essence of who you are.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr Ghada Karmi*</p>

<p ALIGN="center">(1-2)</b></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">AS we approach the phase of the final status negotiations in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the question of what is to result from that process
becomes more urgent. Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, seems to have already stated
his position ahead of the start of negotiations. He has accepted the idea of a Palestinian
state, although its sovereign powers should be curtailed in line with Israeli security
demands and it must be physically separate from Israel; the settlers must remain under
Israeli rule; Jerusalem would remain Israel's &quot;united capital&quot;; and there would
be no refugee return - refugees must be settled in the countries where they now reside.
Hence it would seem that Israel has dictated ahead of time the terms on which it would
enter into the final status negotiations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For those who support the Oslo process and the idea of a Palestinian
state, these revelations must have come as a bitter blow, for the current peace process
between Israel and the Palestinians involves two central concepts. The first is that the
Oslo Agreement of 1993 is the best option in the circumstances and hence the only way
forward In fact, it has been rather superseded by the Wye Agreement of 1998, which is yet
to be fully implemented, and no one is quite sure what process is now taking place between
the two sides. The second is that a two-state solution should be the end result of the
process. These two ideas dominate the peace discourse, especially the first, so much so
that the difficulties with the process have been seen for some time exclusively in terms
of getting the two parties to re-start the negotiations on the basis of the Oslo accords.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both these ideas should now be re-examined. First of all, the Oslo
Agreement, irrespective of whether one supported it or not, has had a continual history of
serious difficulties. A number of its provisions, as agreed between the Palestinians and
previous Israel governments, have yet to be fulfilled. The most important of these are the
permanent status negotiations, which have been delayed but are now said to be starting
soon, and the changes taking place in the Palestinian territories ahead of these
negotiations. It will be recalled that the Oslo Agreement was structured on the basis of
two stages, a so-called interim or transitional period of five years, and a final phase
when a permanent settlement would be drawn up between the parties.<sup> </sup>The
Agreement stipulated that final status talks would start no later than the beginning of
the third year after it was first signed, that is by January 1997. Not only have the talks
not started, but Israel's previous prime minister tried to sidestep the interim terms
altogether and proceed directly to the permanent settlement. Ehud Barak has followed on in
this tradition by his latest proposal to merge the last stage of the Wye Agreement into
the final status talks. He was in any case no enthusiast for the Oslo Agreement, which he
thought too lax on security arrangements and whose timetable on withdrawal he regarded as
ceding too much territory to the Palestinians too quickly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, the Israeli government has been actively involved in
settlement expansion and building both in Jerusalem and the West Bank. The issue of
settlements and the future of Jerusalem were supposed to be decided only during the final
status negotiations. Nothing should have been done by either side to alter the status quo,
because it might preempt the final outcome. In fact, the settler population in Gaza and
the West Bank increased during the first year of Binyamin Netanyahu's premiership by 9.4
per cent. By 1998, it had reached 180,000 people in the West Bank and Gaza and the number
of settlers in and around Jerusalem was around 200,000. The population of the nine largest
West Bank settlements increased by 6 per cent during the first nine months of 1998. At the
same time, a number of existing settlements were expanded by the building of additional
housing, and new ones were established.<sup> </sup>On April 14 of this year, <i>Haaretz </i>reported
that twelve new settlements had been built in the West Bank since the Wye Summit.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In February 1997, the new settlement of Har Homa to the south of Jerusalem
was approved by Israel's last prime minister and in September another was established at
Ras al-Amud in the heart of East Jerusalem. For Har Homa 6,500 dwellings are planned and
the first 1,000 have already been advertised for sale. The current prime minister never
opposed construction of either of these settlements which he regards as &quot;housing
projects.&quot; His only criticism of the Netanyahu record on Jerusalem settlements is
that it attracted the wrong sort of publicity and their establishment could have been
ignored by the international community had his style not been so confrontational. Barak
himself regards the West Bank as part of the land of Israel where the state has every
right to build settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On November 13, 1998, the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to
condemn Israel for illegal settlement building, especially in Jerusalem. Of course, the
U.N.vote was taken within the framework of Israel's violation of international law, and
not of the Oslo Accords. Meanwhile, the timetable on troop redeployment from Palestinian
territory has been subject to many delays. The Oslo Agreement stated that the final
settlement would be based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. These resolutions
both stress the obligation of Israel to withdraw from territories occupied in the war of
1967, including the West Bank and Gaza. In accordance with this idea, a timetable for the
redeployment of Israeli forces from these areas was drawn up with successive Israeli
governments. But the process was incomplete and also agonizingly slow, the last withdrawal
being 2 per cent of the West Bank out of the 13 per cent agreed at the Wye Summit.
Furthermore, the present Israeli prime minister has already made dear that withdrawal by
Israel to the 1967 borders is ruled out. Other matters that had also been agreed prior to
the era of Netanyahu, such as the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, the
building of a port at Gaza, and the opening of a safe corridor between Gaza and the West
Bank, remain outstanding and await possible implementation during forthcoming Israeli
Palestinian talks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is in this framework that the Palestine state solution should be seen.
In the last few years, this idea has become accepted dogma. Of course, it is not a new
invention of the peace process, but it has never before enjoyed such credence. It was
first raised in 1974, when the Palestine National Council (PNC) voted at its 12th meeting
to establish a Palestinian &quot;authority&quot; on any liberated part of the Palestinian
homeland. In the later 1970s, this decision was defined further to mean that a state
should be set up on the liberated lands. This was not universally welcomed by
Palestinians, many of whom were dismayed that the goal of total liberation had been given
up. Despite this and ever since then, however, the Palestinian leadership has consistently
aimed for an independent state, to be set up in the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem
as its capital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, this position crystallized and
found support, both tacit and overt, from the Arab world and the international community
with the exception of Israel and the United States. The Arab League had in any case
accepted &quot;Palestine&quot; as a member state in 1976. In November, 1988, the PNC
meeting in Algiers formally accepted the existence of two separate states, Israel and the
new Palestine. Nine years later on November 13, 1997, Yasser Arafat announced that the PLO
would declare the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in 1999, that is, at
the end of the interim period of the Oslo Agreement.<sup> </sup>In fact, the May 4
deadline passed without the crisis that had been anticipated by the international
community The Palestinian leadership, which was cajoled into believing that a declaration
at that moment would be damaging to the chances of a Labor Israeli government being
elected in May, postponed the event to a later time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the exact boundaries of the proposed state have not been defined,
even by the Palestinians, and international support has not expressed itself in terms of
square meters of land that might constitute the new state, the idea of such an entity
&#147;alongside Israel&quot; has taken firm hold. And there is widespread if tacit
acceptance of the idea even in Israel; although there has never been any official
endorsement of a Palestine state, there is a feeling of resignation toward this as a
probable outcome. Even the hard-line Israeli minister for infrastructure at the time,
Ariel Sharon, was quoted on November 25, 1997, as saying that he recognised &quot;with
deep regret&quot; that giving the Palestinians an entity of their own would lead
inevitably to the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, the idea of two states so dominates the discourse about the final
outcome of the peace process as to exclude all other possibilities. Yet, in the
circumstances, the two-state solution for this intractable conflict seems ever more
impracticable. And, even if it had been, it would not be desirable for reasons that will
be explained below.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center">Is A Palestinian State Feasible?</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If we take first the question of feasibility, we see at once that there
are considerable logistical obstacles in the way of setting up a Palestinian state. A
glance at the latest map of the occupied territories explains the position. This shows a
West Bank pockmarked by Jewish settlements encircling Palestinian towns and separating
them from each other, criss-crossed by so-called bypass roads built for the exclusive use
of Israelis and breaking up Palestinian territory even more. Sharing the territory of the
West Bank and Gaza with the Palestinians are 180,000 Jews and some 200,000 in and around
East Jerusalem. With the latest settlement at Jabal Abu Ghoneim (Har Homa) to the south of
Jerusalem, the separation between Jerusalem and the West Bank has become complete. The map
thus shows no territorial continuity among the Palestinian areas in the West Bank, which
are cut off from each other, from Gaza, and from Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the settlements remain, then any projected Palestinian state would have
no meaningful territory on which to become established. The problem is further complicated
by the lack of natural resources, from which the Palestinian areas currently suffer. One
of the effects of thirty years of Israeli occupation has been a transfer of resources from
the Palestinian inhabitants to the settlers. It has been calculated that by 1989, 90 per
cent of the West Bank's cultivatable land and 75 per cent of its water had been switched
to the settlers and beyond them to Israel. Since the Palestinian economy is heavily
dependent on agriculture (in 1991, it accounted for 35 per cent of the West Bank's and
Gaza's GDP, as compared with 2 per cent for Israel) this depletion of land and water is
extremely serious. The shortage reached crisis proportions this summer with a once-weekly
availability of only drinking water to Palestinian West Bank inhabitants. To make matters
worse, there was a significant lack of investment in the infrastructure of the West Bank
and Gaza throughout the years of Israeli occupation. Sara Roy, who undertook a detailed
study of Gaza's economy in 1995, has described the impact of Israel's occupation of the
Strip as a deliberate process of &quot;de-development.&quot; She defines this as an
economic policy designed to ensure that there will be no economic base, even one that is
malformed, to support an independent indigenous existence. She found that over the period
of occupation, Gaza's economic resources in water, land, and public finance were
extensively expropriated by the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unskilled labor in Israel consequently became a major economic activity
for Palestinians from Gaza and the rest of the occupied territories. In 1990, nearly 35
per cent of the Palestinian labor force was working in Israel. Due to these factors, the
already weakened Palestinian economy became heavily dependent on Israel. Since 1993, the
economic situation in the Palestinian territories has deteriorated further as a result of
the Israeli policy of closures imposed on Gaza and the West Bank and the importation of
foreign labor into Israel which today houses an estimated 250,000 foreign workers. The
Palestinian areas are thus disadvantaged by high unemployment (at least 50 per cent in
Gaza and 20 per cent in the West Bank), imposed trade restrictions, an undeveloped
industrial base, and poor natural resources. Any Palestinian state set up on this basis is
obviously not viable and could only survive with a massive infusion of billions of dollars
in aid. It is in this context that a federation with Jordan, which has frequently been
proposed, would have the greatest value. Among other things, it is argued that this would
promote free movement of labor within the federation, easing the economic problems, and
Ehud Barak is on record as favoring a con-federation with Jordan.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">E. Yaghi</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No one should ever give up everything they hold dear in life, not for
anyone. For in the end, the one who sacrificed will not be satisfied, nor will those for
whom the sacrifice was made ever understand.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And so it happened, the young lady with dreams in her head and love in her
heart gave up her country, her parents, and her sibling to travel to a Middle Eastern
place. She gave it all up because of the great love she had for her husband and to ensure
that her children would grow up free from drugs, alcohol and immoral diseases.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She never expected the drastic way her life would change or all that she
would have to give up in order to try to make her dreams a reality. Looking back, Chris
often wondered if she had really made the right decision. Had she done the right thing?
But she always came back to the same conclusion that she would do it all over again for
the sake of her children. The same children now who had become her judge and jurors. The
same children who now passed sentence on her with ease of conscience. The same children
who expected her to go on living a life she was not happy living so they could comfortably
slot her away somewhere in the back of their minds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those were the children that she had struggled to keep clean, fed and free
from danger. Those were the children that she had lived through several wars for when what
she had really wanted to do was move back to America with them where they might have been
spared the dangers of those conflicts. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How she had loved his cause and his people. How she had tried to adapt to
their way of life. How she had tried so hard and got so tired doing it. Perhaps if things
had been different, all this would not have mattered. She could have done all of this,
made all these sacrifices. Even dying for the Palestinian cause seemed to be noble and
fitting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But somewhere along the way, once outside her country, and into her
husband&#146;s host country, Chris discovered that she suddenly was all alone. And her
husband knew that she was. On the other hand, he was at his prime and surrounded by his
relatives who could always encourage him to be very macho. Macho at the expense of his
wife and kids. Any time he flew into a violent rage, she had no one to protect her, no one
to turn to, and no one to defend her rights. In short, he was the king of his little
kingdom and he enjoyed abusing his power. It was at this time that her great love for him
began to wilt and die, for a flower, no matter how beautiful or how fragrant, cannot
survive without water, just as a marriage cannot survive without respect and justice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, she could have been stronger. She could have stood up for her rights
more. But most of what she did do was try to keep peace in her household and protect her
children from their father&#146;s wrath. She was wrong and she knew that now. And all the
years of pain she had suffered and all the tears she had shed as a result were gone with
the blowing of the wind.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And so it came to pass, one day after her children had all grown, Chris
packed a single bag and just walked out of her home. She left it all behind her. The house
she had worked so hard to maintain and save money for. The newly bought car that she would
never drive again. She walked out on the support of her kids and entered a new realm. One
of no money, no home of her own and no car to drive. Yet, she also now had freedom, no
outbursts of violent temper from her husband and no one to try to control her every
movement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Alone on the shores of America, Chris has had much time to reflect on her
escape to freedom and also what she had to sacrifice in order to gain that freedom. In so
trying to be honest with her feelings, to really be honest, there was no one to listen to
her. No one to help her get back up again. No one to tell her that she perhaps had done
the right thing. But now she had her children to condemn her and to let her know that as
long as she remained in a marriage she was miserable in, no one really minded. The moment
she stepped outside to freedom and to honesty, then she was all alone.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes it is really better to be yourself even if you are hated for it
than to be someone you are not and be loved. All Chris can do now is to try to make a
living in a country she has not lived in for most of her adult life and to continue to
write and work for the Palestinian people and for all the Arab people who do not have
honesty or freedom as a way of life. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Israeli journalists expressed similar fears and went further than
did Markus in their published articles. Some attacked not only the religious but also the
secular Jews who remained silent about the attacks upon them and their behavior and who
would allow continual efforts by religious surveyors to brainwash systematically. Many
Israeli Jews, whose opinions were represented by certain journalists, saw the activities
and actual victories by religious factions as advancements towards a full-scale Jewish
&quot;Khomeinism&quot; in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The discussion of the Aloni scandal continued for weeks in the Israeli
press and became increasingly political. Nahum Barnea wrote in his October 23, 1992 <i>Yediot
Ahronot </i>article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabin encouraged the torrents of anti-Aloni propaganda by advancing the
  slogan &quot;either Aloni or peace.&quot; What connection can there be between Aloni's
  dietary preferences and peace&#133;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">On four separate occasions Rabin summoned the leaders of Meretz [Aloni's
  party] to his office in order to convey to them the complaints about Aloni made by Rabbi
  Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual head of the Shas Party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his October 23, 1992 <i>Davar </i>article, Amir Oren censured Rabin for
being subservient to Rabbi Ovadia Yoseph and for equating the rabbi's power to be equal to
that of Stalin's in his time. Oren opined that the Shas Party had begun to fulfil in
Israel a role analogous to that of the Shi'ites in Lebanon. In Oren's view Israel,
&quot;far from being the only democracy in the Middle East was imitating Lebanon and Iran,
becoming in effect half a state of anarchy and half a theocracy.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amnon Abromovitz in his October 23, 1992 <i>Maariv </i>article put a
somewhat different spin on the Aloni scandal. He wrote: &quot;The vicious use of Aloni as
a scapegoat by the religious Jews generated public support for her. A repelling stench of
religious zeal, fundamentalism and sexism is emanating from the harassment of Aloni.&quot;
Abromovitz blamed Rabin for encouraging this harassment, but he added that despite all her
talk and non-kosher eating, Aloni had granted religious institutions, especially those of
the Shas, more money than had any previous Minister of Education. Abramovitz concluded:
&#147;Aloni may talk blasphemously about God, but she has been foremost in generosity to
those who believe in Him.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The leaders of the Labor Party and their non-traditionalist sympathizers
answered the above expressions of fear, especially after Oslo, by arguing that concessions
to the demands of the Haredim were necessary to ensure backing for the peace process. This
stock answer did not satisfy many secular Israelis. What Markus concluded represented
broad secular opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The reason for Rabin's servility to Shas is supposed to be politics. Labor
  experts in skullduggery assure us that the Shas Party may leave the coalition if it finds
  it no longer able to withstand pressure from the other Haredi circles... The conclusion is
  that Labor must do its best to placate them . . Politics is important, but freedom of
  conscience and everyone's right to follow one's creed are even more important. Jewish
  secularism is a creed. The crude hypocrisy, with which the ministers fake religious
  devotions, leads nowhere but only damages their government 's integrity. If Shas wants to
  leave Rabin's coalition, it will do so by order of its rabbis. It will then not help if
  Rabin puts on an Haredi garb and/or if Aloni shaves her head to cover it with a coif. [The
  reference here is to a commandment of traditional Judaism that a woman, before marrying,
  has to shave her head and cover it with a coif. The Haredim attempt to enforce this rule
  strictly. Many Jewish, religious women cut only some of their hair and cover the remainder
  with wigs. Many secular, Jewish women are enraged by this rule.]</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">By design, Haredi rabbis and politicians select secular women in politics
  as the primary targets of their attacks, even though they could pinpoint -secular men as
  much, if not more, for transgressions of religious law. The Haredim repeatedly refer to
  Jewish women, engaged in politics, as witches, bitches or demons. Although a bit crude at
  times in the use of descriptive language, the Haredim approach mirrors to a great extent
  traditional Judaism's broadly based position regarding women. This position not only
  restricts the rights of women but in many ways holds women in contempt. Rule 8 in Chapter
  3 of the <i>Kitzur Shulhan Aruch (Abridgment Shulhan Aruch), </i>an elementary textbook
  for Jews with little talmudic education, for example, dictates: &quot;A male should not
  walk between two females or two dogs or two pigs. In the same manner the males should not
  allow a woman, dog or pig to walk between them.&quot; All Haredi boys between the ages of
  ten and twelve study and are required to observe this rule. (Few dogs and no pigs can be
  found in Haredi neighborhoods.) Traditional Judaism also prohibits women from playing even
  insignificant roles in politics and/or in any public activities in which they may appear
  to be leading males. Women are forbidden to drive buses or taxis; they can drive private
  cars only if no males apart from those in their own families or other women are
  passengers. These and many rules are followed in Haredi neighborhoods. In these
  neighborhoods women who are &quot;dressed immodestly&quot; are often insulted and/or
  assaulted. Many traditionally religious Jewish males in other than Haredi neighborhoods,
  who do not observe inconvenient religious commandments, take the lead of the Haredim in
  resenting and opposing participation of women in politics. These traditionally religious
  males regard such participation by women as a threat to their domination of their own
  families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The numerous misogynistic statements in the Talmud and in talmudic
literature constitute a pan of every Haredi male's sacred study. The statement in <i>Tractate
Shabat, </i>page 152b, defining a woman is exemplary: &quot;A woman is a sack full of
excrement.&quot; The learned <i>Talmudic Encyclopedia </i>(volume 2, pages 255-7), written
in modern Hebrew and thus understandable to all educated Israeli Jews, devotes a section
to the &quot;nature and behavior of women.&quot; In this section the proposition appears
that the urge for the sexual act is greater among men than among women. The evidence
presented for this is that men tend to hire women prostitutes because their urge for sex
is greater than the urge of women. For that reason the Halacha punishes a wife who refuses
to have sexual relations with her husband much more severely than it punishes a husband
who refuses to have sexual relations with his wife. For the same reason a prospective
husband is obliged to see his wife-to-be before marrying her but a prospective wife is not
obligated to see her husband-to-be before marriage. After seeing his prospective bride,
moreover, the prospective husband can send a messenger and conduct the marriage through
the messenger. Jewish folklore contains stories describing the utilization of this
procedure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The halachic prohibition of teaching talmudic literature and/or the Bible
to women has been in the past and is currently still of great importance. Studying
&quot;Torah Sheba'al Peh&quot; (the oral law) is for the Halacha a supremely important
commandment. It is equivalent in importance to all the other commandments put together.
(The law, according to belief, was given by God orally to Moses and was handed down orally
for many centuries before being written.) This obligation, termed &quot;Talmud Torah&quot;
or &quot;learning the Torah&quot; is viewed as independent of time. Every pious male Jew
is obligated to devote a portion of all days and nights, including holidays and working
days, to this study. A basic talmudic rule frees women from positive obligations tat are
dependent on special times and obliges women only with positive obligations that are
independent of time. Women, for example, are obliged to keep the Sabbath and the holidays
that last more than twenty-four hours and are thus considered to be independent of time.
Women, on the other hand, are not obliged to hear the shofar (ram's horn) blown on the New
Year, which only takes a short time and is thus considered to be dependent on time. (There
are a few exceptions to this rule.) A woman is permitted to fulfill what she is not
obliged to do; hence she can choose to hear the ram's horn blown on the New Year. This
rule underlines the women's religious inferiority to men, since another talmudic dictate
is that a person who fulfills a commandment because he is obliged to do so is greater and
receives a greater reward from God than a person who fulfills a commandment he is not
obliged to fulfill. A Jewish woman that comes to the synagogue on the New Year and hears
the ram's horn being blown, according to traditional Judaism, will receive a smaller
reward from God than a male who does the same, because she is not obliged to hear whereas
he is so obliged. <i>Tractate Kiddushin</i> (page 34a) of the Talmud, however, ruled that
women are not obliged to fulfill &quot;Talmud Torah,&quot; even though it is an obligation
independent of time. This ruling is part of Halacha. The rule was later amended to mean
that women should learn only the special obligations that they must keep to the extent
that they know what to do and what to avoid. The issue, therefore, arose: What parts of
sacred studies are women permitted to learn or to be taught? The talmudic answer to this
question, based upon many quotations, was given by Maimonides. In his work, <i>Talmud
Torah Laws</i> (chapter 1, rule 13), Maimonides wrote:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A woman who has studied Torah receives a reward [from God], but it is an
inferior one when compared to man's reward. This is because she is not obligated [to do
so], and everyone who does what he is not obliged to do gets an inferior reward compared
to [the reward given to] one who does what he is commanded to do. The woman nevertheless
receives some reward. The sages commanded a father not to teach his daughter Torah,
because most woman never intend to learn anything and will, because of the weak
understanding, convert the pronouncements of Torah into nonsense. The sages said:
&quot;Everyone who teaches his daughter Torah can be compared to one who teaches her
insipid matters.&quot; This rule, however, applies only to talmudic studies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although a woman should not be taught the Bible, she, if taught, would not
have been taught insipid matters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A somewhat shortened version of this is given in the authoritative
compendium of the Halacha, <i>Shulhan Aruch (</i>Yorah Deah, rule 246, paragraph 6). In
modem times the Haredim have attempted to modify those rules to some extent. They have
taught and still do teach girls the easier parts of the Talmud, in which arguments between
the rabbis, that are considered to be dangerous for the &quot;weak female mind&quot;, do
not occur. Similarly, the Haredim have taught and do teach girls the Pentateuch but
reserve the highest level and most serious commentaries for the boys The Haredim maintain
in their schools a strict separation of girls from boys and do not allow the girls to
observe boys playing in the schoolyard.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Israeli Jews, who in their youth received thorough talmudic
educations, have later in their lives reacted antagonistically against Orthodox Judaism's
depiction and treatment of women. Some of these Jews in reaction have written articles
that are often published in the Israeli Hebrew press but are almost never translated into
English. Kadid Leper, for example, a well-known Israeli journalist who as a youth studied
in a yeshiva for years before becoming a secularist, wrote in his April 18, 1997 <i>Hai&#146;r
</i>article under the title &quot;Woman is a sack full of excrement,&quot; the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Beatings, sexual brutality, cruelty, deprival of rights, use of a woman as
  merely a sexual object; you can find all of this there [in the Talmud] ... For two
  thousand years women had a well defined place in the Jewish religion [Orthodox Judaism];
  this place is different from what the rabbinical establishment describes; according to the
  Halacha, the place of women is in the garbage heap together with cattle and slaves.
  According to the Jewish religion [Orthodox Judaism] a man buys for himself a slave woman
  for her entire life simply by providing food and dress and granting to his wife the sexual
  act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This kind of published article, together with the many published reports
of rabbinical harassment of women, have not only firmed polarization in Israeli Jewish
society but have contributed significantly to the growing secular enmity towards Haredim.</p>
