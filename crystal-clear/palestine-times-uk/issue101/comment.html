</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is increasingly clear that Yasser Arafat&#146;s mental ability has
considerably diminished of late, so much so that serious questions ought to be raised
about his fitness in fulfilling his obligations regarding the leadership of the
Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to confidential sources, Arafat is exhibiting several signs of
early senility, most likely resulting from brain degeneration. These include severe memory
loss, inability to focus, to speak clearly or to move about with ease as well as
increasing nervousness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In order to blur these signs, mainly from the eyes and minds of his
people, Arafat has refused to hold a single press conference in the autonomous enclaves
for over two years now, and whenever he is asked by journalists to comment on or respond
to important events, he usually gives extremely terse and poorly worded answers before he
is whisked away by his aides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In one particular recent event in Ramallah, Arafat spoke only for three to
four minutes, with clearly slurred tones, and then a cheer was enforced before he was
taken away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat&#146;s shivering lips, cheeks and hands suggest that even his
physical health is questionable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, what is important here is his deteriorating mental ability,
which most directly affects his decision-making process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is doubly important because Arafat is an autocrat that solely and
single-mindedly takes all the decisions affecting the Palestinian Authority, whether it is
a decision on the peace process or permission to repair a car or a request for vacation,
as Edward Said pointed out in a recent article.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No one else knows where the money is, where it came from, and where it is
spent except he.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the final analysis, it would not be an overstatement to say that Arafat
is effectively the Palestinian Authority. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given his autocracy, senility and ostensible indispensability (he has made
himself indispensable by eliminating other credible alternatives to him in case of a power
vacuum), Arafat&#146;s continued leadership could spell disaster for the Palestinian
people and the Palestinian cause, especially if he is allowed to take a central role in
the upcoming final status talks with the Barak government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The so-called agreements he has signed with the Israelis recently,
particularly the Sharm el-Sheikh and the Safe Passage protocols, suggest that there is
something clearly abnormal with Arafat&#146;s mental ability and the way he takes his
decisions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Take, for example, the sensitive prisoners&#146; issue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat reportedly rebuked and nearly fired his chief negotiator Sa&#146;eb
Ureikat who was insisting that Israel carry out the Wye River clauses affecting prisoners.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, even Fatah leaders, although they speak in indirect terms, have
recently spoken of the necessity of preventing the President from &#147;drifting away too
much&#148; and &#147;crossing our national red lines.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is amply clear that those &#147;leaders&#148; lack the courage
and integrity to stand up to the President, even if he chooses to cross the red lines.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, Sakher Habash, a high-ranking Fatah official in the West Bank,
resorted to silence when he was asked what he and the rest of his colleagues in the Fatah
leadership would do in case Arafat accepted an Israeli-dictated deal whereby a Palestinian
State would be established on a small part of the West Bank and without Jerusalem as its
capital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that Habash and his colleagues began looking at each others&#146;
faces, instead of giving a straightforward answer, suggested that they cannot be relied
upon to restrain Arafat from selling out Palestinian rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government, especially the intelligence services, are well
aware of Arafat&#146;s mental deterioration and his vulnerability and &#147;ultimate
willingness&#148; to concede on sensitive issues such as Jerusalem and the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the Israeli premier Ehud Barak, acting on recommendations from the
Shin Bet intelligence service and the Mossad, proposed in a recent interview with the
Jerusalem Post that Israel should enter into high-gear intensive talks with the PA before
Arafat is dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The rationale behind the sudden Israeli interest in accelerating the
&#147;peace talks&#148; apparently stems from the conviction of the intelligence apparatus
that no other Palestinian leader would grant Israel a better deal, one that would
presumably virtually liquidate the Palestinian question, including the paramount
refugees&#146; cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat has for some time made the Palestinian cause his own, so much so
that one can now speak about the two interchangeably. And given this, and in light of his
deteriorating mental ability, there is no doubt that his &#147;personal
circumstances&#148; will compel him to sign whatever the Israelis and the Americans order
him to sign.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, if Arafat were to realize what he has done and what the
enemy&#151;the peace partner&#151;expects him to do during the final status talks, he
should step down in dignity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, since this is unlikely given Arafat&#146;s egotistic obstinate
mindset, the Palestinian people, including Islamist and nationalist forces, ought to say
&#147;no&#148; to Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, an unmistakable warning should also be made to the United States
and to Israel that any agreement or deal signed with Arafat under these conditions would
be null and void and unbinding upon the Palestinians. </p>
