refugees inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daoud Abdullah*</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Security Council met on 6 November 1989, it failed to adopt draft
resolution S/20945/Rev.1. While 14 countries condemned Israeli human rights violations in
the occupied territories, one permanent member&#151;the United States of
America&#151;voted against it. Ten years later, life for the Palestinian civilians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) remain an absolute nightmare. Despite the numerous
agreements signed between the Palestinians and the Occupying Power, they have witnessed an
alarming decline of living standards in areas of employment, income, property ownership,
education and health. Arbitrary arrests, torture and deaths while in police custody have,
likewise, persisted along with draconian restrictions on freedom of movement, expression
and association. The United Nations&#146; failure to stop the abuses in 1989 has since
resulted in the consolidation of Israeli apartheid and the obstruction of every attempt to
bring peace to this tormented land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given his unshakable faith in the theory that &#147;high fences make good
neighbours&#148;, Israel&#146;s incumbent Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, is almost certain to
make matters worse. The total separation that he advocates involves the building of
overhead bridges in the West Bank to link the disjointed Palestinian entity and yet
preserve the status quo; us here and them over there. In the Gaza Strip, it means, among
other things, that 500,000 Palestinian refugees will remain holed up in 3 square miles of
derelict camps surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled 24 hours a day. Faced with
ever-increasing criticism, Zionist apologists still justify these policies with the claim
that &#147;we&#148; Jews are the harbingers of Western modernization to &#147;them&#148;
backward Arabs. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Cruel Facts</font></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With all the bloodshed and tears that it incurred, life in the refugee
camp represents the most horrific aspect of the Palestinian <i>Nakba</i> (Catastrophe). In
the WBGS and East Jerusalem, it is estimated that at least 60% of the population are
refugees. While the individual refugee in the overcrowded Balata, Dahaysha, Tulkarm, and
al-Ayn camps occupies only 15, 14, 12 and 8 square metres respectively, an individual
Jewish immigrant in Aylat and Afoolah has 4,160 and 1,300 square metres respectively.
Likewise, while more than 1 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have access to only 60%
of the land, 4,000 Israeli soldiers occupy 35%. The average Israeli settler has 146 times
more living space than his Palestinian counterpart. Thus, with the rapid shrinkage of
Palestinian land even to bury their dead, the similarity with apartheid South Africa is
all too self-evident. Under the latter system a 5% white minority appropriated 87% of the
land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are, clearly, several conflicting forces at work here. The United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) complains it has insufficient funds to purchase or
lease additional land to accommodate the refugees. In the Gaza Strip, Israel prevents the
Agency from rebuilding shelters which it destroyed for &#147;security reasons&#148;, let
alone to speak of expanding the camps. Still more fundamentally, the refugees themselves
are wary of any attempt to establish new camps. This, they fear, may be a mechanism used
to resettle and deny them the right to return to their homes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Being a traditionally agrarian people, the loss of their land has
certainly had a devastating effect upon the Palestinians. Although a few of them
subsequently became small-scale businessmen, many of the WBGS inhabitants became dependent
on Israel&#146;s economy for their incomes, particularly in construction, domestic and
retail services. Like the black shantytowns of apartheid South Africa, the Palestinian
refugee camps have become major sources of cheap labour. Israel&#146;s introduction of a
permit system for Palestinian workers after Oslo was, in effect, a crude adoption of the
hated South African pass laws. Both the difficulty of obtaining these permits and the
constant security closures have contributed to the 40% and 30% unemployment rates in Gaza
and the West Bank respectively.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under Israeli apartheid nothing is achieved without a struggle. Everything
which the Jewish State gives with one hand it takes back with the other. The safe passage
which it ratified at Sharm el-Sheikh is a notable example. After guaranteeing the free
movement of Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank, Israel retained the right to
issue magnetic identity cards to monitor, search and arrest travellers. Such
obstructionist measures can serve no other purpose than to undermine and frustrate
Palestinian aspirations to independence. They, moreover, make a mockery of the Palestinian
Authority who must send the names of would-be travellers to Israel for approval before the
<i>laissez-passer </i>can be issued. Nothing demonstrated the absurdity of this
arrangement more forcefully than the recent visit to the territories by a Jordanian
parliamentary delegation. The unsolicited stamping of their passports with Israeli visas
was considered one insult too many and thus resulted in the cancellation of the trip by
some members.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Brute force and guns are not the only instruments used to weaken the
Palestinians. Throughout the three decades of Israeli occupation, they have been
deliberately offered an inferior education geared to keep them an impoverished and servile
people. The current increase of illiteracy among refugee children in the WBGS is not,
therefore, a freak social phenomenon. It is instead the result of years of stagnation and
neglect. While the political, social, economic and security conditions engendered by the
occupation contributed to this for the most part, the educational policy of UNRWA was also
responsible. For whatever reasons, the international Agency still refuses to provide
educational training beyond secondary level for the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, when teachers&#146; meetings are forbidden because they are
deemed seditious, such an educational system can never become a vehicle of empowerment or
development. When libraries and laboratories are considered expensive luxuries and not
necessities, the task of motivating students and helping them to achieve high standards
inevitably becomes more difficult. When an occupation army controls the educational system
of the people it occupies, one must not expect the growth or expansion of their
educational infrastructure. Actually, there is no such thing as a benevolent occupation.
Since all these factors exist in the WBGS, it is wholly understandable why Palestinian
schools presently operate double and triple shifts where students attend for three and a
half hours and are then forced to make way for others.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Whose Agreements?</font></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That Palestinian import and export trade is still unable to break through
onto regional and international markets is yet another grim reminder of the consequences
of Israeli occupation. Equally, the annual decline of the Palestinian GNP per capita at
the rate of 35% since 1993 has less to do with the market forces of supply and demand than
with Israel&#146;s continued dominance of border crossings. These negative trends will all
persist and, indeed, become worse as long as the occupation of the WBGS continues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since every accord signed with Israel to date has failed to terminate its
status as the Occupying Power, the international community must now thoroughly reappraise
its policies toward these agreements. For one thing, the accords have not upheld the
humanitarian standards of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 7 of the Convention states
that <i>&#147;no special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of protected
persons.&#148;</i> As &#147;protected persons&#148;, the foremost right of the Palestinian
refugees is the right to return. Article 8 expressly forbids the refugees themselves from
renouncing this right. <i>&#147;Protected persons may in no circumstances renounce in part
or entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention,&#133;&#148;</i> As a
signatory to the 1949 Geneva Civilians Convention, Israel is legally bound to effect the
repatriation of persons expelled or made temporarily absent by war. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though many politicians and States have bowed to pressure from the Jewish
State, international law remains unalterably on the side of the refugees. It, moreover,
limits the scope and nature of agreements that can be signed between their representative
(the PLO) and the Occupying Power (Israel). Of course, Washington would always claim that
the outstanding issues are subject to the results of the current negotiations. The truth
of the matter, though, is that Article 47 of the Convention states:</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Protected persons who are in occupied territories shall not be deprived,
in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any
change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions
or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the
authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by
the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the States that
drafted the Convention consciously included this article following historical precedents
where Occupying Powers exploited their powers to force the authorities or representatives
of the occupied people to diminish or relinquish their rights. If the international
community does not take immediate and appropriate measures concerning the WBGS, the
American-sponsored peace process may very well lead to similar results. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the wheeling and dealing intensifies behind closed doors, tensions
continue to rise in the camps by the hour. Some observers argue that the powers-that-be
are quite prepared to allow things to become worse so that the desperate refugees will
accept any settlement thrown at them by the Israelis. Others have, on their part, raised a
call for increased international relief and aid. Is this really the way ahead? Past
experience invalidates this approach. For although the Palestinians have been the
recipients of generous international aid for the last 50 years, it did not improve the
quality of their lives in their overcrowded camps. Indeed, the billions of dollars worth
of aid did not stop the camps from becoming the fountains of revolution in the 1970s and
the <i>Intifadah</i> in the 1980s. Why?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The refugee camps are theatres of solidarity and resistance. They are
places where age-old Palestinian customs and traditions are preserved. They are bases
where social and communal ties are fostered and where national aspirations are fuelled.
The dream to return burns in the hearts of every refugee from Haifa, Galilee, Bethlehem
and Jerusalem. Wherever they came from in Palestine, be it village, town or city, they all
aspire to this common destiny. Their long and patient struggle against Zionist occupation
confirms that only this will satisfy them. Surely their demand is legitimate and
honourable. Is it not time, therefore, that they be allowed to live normal, stable and
productive lives free of racist discrimination, fascist repression and economic
exploitation?!</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Sheikh Ra'ed Salah: Al-Aqsa Mosque in danger</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Sheikh Ra'ed Salah is the leader of the Islamic
movement in pre-1967 Palestine (Israel proper). His uncompromising Islamic activism ,
especially his adamant refusal to render any moral legitimacy to the Zionist regime, have
invited vindictive hostility from the Zionist establishment. Recently, Israeli officials,
including government ministers, called for his arrest, following the recent ambiguous
failed bomb attacks in Haifa and Akka, which many Palestinians are convinced were
fabricated by the Israeli intelligence service, Shin Bet, in order to create a pretext to
crack down on the Islamic movement. Salah was interviewed recently by PT. The following
are excerpts of what he said:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: How do you read the latest wave of incitement against the
Islamic movement in Israel?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: This incitement and vilification campaign is merely a
continuation of the hostility that we experienced from the very inception of the Islamic
movement. It is also part of the overall hostility against the worldwide Islamic revival.
The current wave differs from past waves in the fact that the entire apparatus of the
Jewish State is mobilized against us, including the security apparatus, the police, the
intelligence, the opposition and the media, and they all vie among themselves to libel us,
incite against the movement and besmirch our image.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Are you surprised by the severity and scope of this campaign?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, I am surprised by the scope of this vindictive campaign and
the extremely virulent language used against the Arab masses in Palestine, the Islamic
movement and me personally. The purpose of this virulent onslaught is to test our reaction
and the people's reaction in case they decided to crack down on us. Luckily, their efforts
failed, and the people rallied around us as never before. Indeed, the impressive popular
solidarity which we received was the reason behind the government's decision not to crack
down on us.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: But the government apparently thought it could achieve its goals?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The government sought to have a sort of <i>carte blanche</i> in the
Arab Sector and its way of accomplishing that was by dividing Arabs into &#147;good
guys&#148; and &#147;bad guys&#148;. They used this exposed methodology in the past, and
now they are applying and employing it again, this time against the Islamic movement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This explained the Labour Party's audacity in repressing the Islamic
movement before the 1996 election, when they arrested a number of our activists and closed
down the Islamic Relief Society and the Orphan and Prisoner Society. This inherent
mentality is fueling the current campaign against us.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: The Israeli media and officials have sought to project the Arab
masses as &quot;moderate&quot; and the Islamic movement as &quot;extremist.&quot; However,
just last year, it was disclosed that the Israeli State viewed all Arabs as a strategic
threat. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: In fact, this is a form of political hypocrisy on the part of the
Labour government. For, on the one hand, the government is aware that the security
establishment views the entirety of the Arab sector, not just the Islamic movement, as a
strategic threat. And on the other, they want to beat the Islamic movement, by projecting
it as a strategic threat that ought to be liquidated and at the same time retain Arab
support for the government, which views Arabs as merely an inventory reserve of votes for
the Labour Party.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: But the collective reaction of Arab masses (in Israel) was
different?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank from the
heart the Arab masses with all their political parties, leaders, activists and media
organizations who refused to be swayed by the government's virulent propaganda.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe this principled position of the masses thwarted the evil designs
of the government against us. Moreover, the courageous stance of our people foiled the
sinister efforts of the government to divide us along sectarian lines. With this
opportunity, I propose that leaders of the Arab sector reach a solemn charter that would
formulate and mould a collective and united Arab stance in the face of government
provocation now and in the future.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: But don't you think that it is only a matter of time before another
campaign is launched against the Islamic movement?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: In my assessment of the situation, it is essential that we rid
ourselves of the cycle of &quot;reacting to their actions.&quot; We must instead adopt the
just cause of our people by taking a united effort that would enjoy collective Arab
support. In other words, we must transform a given cause to a national cause for all Arab
masses in this land. This approach would allow and enable us to deliver ourselves from the
shackles of &quot;hounded victim&quot; that can only react to events.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, there are scores of causes awaiting us in this regard, such as our
holy places which are being desecrated, the grab of our land in the Negev and in al-Ruha,
the battle for our education system, Ikret and Bar'im. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Could it be that part of the incitement campaign is due, at least
in part, to a lack of clarity in the way the Islamic movement projects itself?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The &quot;problem&quot; with the Islamic posture is that it is
uncompromising, and wouldn't give in to the government since this is a matter of
principle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We say in our literature that &quot;he that keeps silent when wrong is
said or done is a mute devil.&quot; Hence, we feel duty-bound to expose the ugly face of
the official Israeli policy of national and racial discrimination against the Arab
community. In my view, this mission is very important for all of us since the official
establishment, from the security apparatus to the ideological arms of the Israeli State,
has yet to realize that they have wronged the Arab masses and that their policy should be
brought to an end immediately. However, instead of coming to terms with what they have
been doing to us, as Arabs, they are now seeking scapegoats and trying to divert
attentions to unfounded illusions about the Islamic movement. Moreover, I believe the
official establishment suffers a certain impotence in understanding the semantics of the
Arabic language, which often results in a limited understanding of our speeches and
statements.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: We are living in a changing world, and the Islamic movement
probably needs to concentrate more on the quality of education. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Obviously, every ideology seeks to maintain and strengthen itself.
And our Islamic movement and Islamic scheme is no exception. However, in our case, we
often collide with scores of other ideologies and schemes, which seek to maintain and
strengthen themselves, often at our expense. Let us be frank, the other schemes have at
their disposal material means greater than that which are at our disposal. For example,
those who promote the Western values have at their disposal satellite channels and
internet sites along with hundreds of publications, in addition to political influence and
the ability to translate their decisions into facts on the ground. However, we should not
think that this situation will continue forever, and who knows, maybe with our limited
means we can change the odds in our favour. God is greater than the world.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What about the claims that the Islamic movement is inciting
violence?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The Islamic movement does not hesitate to say that it is an open
religious movement that bases its ideology and activities on the Qur'an through numerous
institutions and within the scope of the law. Hence, the activities of the Islamic
movement are perfectly legal, and all claims to the contrary are untrue.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Perhaps the Islamic movement's activities concerning the Al-Aqsa
Mosque sparked the incitement campaign.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: We shall not flinch from telling the truth. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is
in danger; we don't say that because we are interested in raising inciteful slogans, but
rather to make the Muslim world aware of the very real dangers and threats looming ahead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We know that certain Israeli groups are seeking to demolish the Mosque and
build on its ruins a Jewish temple. These groups make no secret of their sinister goals,
and we, as Muslims, should not ignore or underestimate the dangers facing Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even at the official level, one Israeli official intimated recently that
there would not be any agreement on Jerusalem as long as the Palestinians continued to
thwart the building of a Jewish temple on the Haram al-Sharif compound. Indeed, those
ignoring these ominous harbingers are actually evading their responsibilities and duties
toward Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: There are those who claim that Al-Aqsa Mosque is not part of the
Islamic religion?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: This is an exposed attempt to dilute the issue of Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Mosque, it must be made clear, is not a possession of the Palestinian people, or the
Arab world, or even the Muslim world. It belongs to all Muslims from the beginning to the
end of time. Hence, maintaining the Mosque is the duty of every Muslim.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Is it true that the Israeli government is interested in ceding Um
el-Fahem to a future Palestinian State?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The Israeli establishment has been thinking in this direction for
some time now. I understand that Israeli officials discussed the idea with PLO officials
even before the establishment of the PA. I also know that (former Israeli Prime Minister)
Shimon Peres discussed the matter with some Palestinian officials. Moreover, Areil Sharon
said openly on a local television in Um el-Fahem that if the people of Um el-Fahem wished
to join the PA, he would help them realize this wish. Furthermore, we see that the
Zionists often ignore the very existence of Um el-Fahem, for example, they don't place the
town on road signs erected at crossroads.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Is it true that the Israeli intelligence services recruited
schoolchildren to inform on their fathers and teachers?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: We at the Municipal Council began to document all these inhuman and
uncivilized behaviours by the Shin Bet. We know that the Shin Bet sought to recruit
schoolchildren, as well as teachers, to inform on their local society. We do this in order
to root out this phenomenon.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Finally, have you personally been the target of incitement?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: I believe there are a number of officials in the security apparatus
who deal with me from a personal consideration, as if they want to settle scores with me.
Some of these officials were worried that they might lose their jobs after I exposed their
role in recruiting children and youngsters in Um el-Fahem. There are also those who lost
their political stance during the al-Rawha uprising last year.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: A final word?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: We are a civilized movement based on Islam. We know that our march
is going to be long, hard and laborious. Therefore, we must be patient and resilient,
because we will succeed in the end, undoubtedly, with God's help.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Safe Passage.. Safe From Whose Perspective?</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>Ramzy Baroud</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before the &#147;safe passage&#148; agreement was reached, a Palestinian
from Gaza had to acquire an Israeli permit, in addition to his &#147;magnetic ID&#148; and
normal ID, so he could safely cross the Israeli borders on his way to or from the West
Bank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has used such advantages to filter Palestinians from both the West
Bank and Gaza attempting to pass through its borders. Those viewed by Israel as a
potential danger to the security of the State were always denied a permit; therefore tens
of thousands of Palestinians are forbidden to travel anywhere, including the outside
world, denied jobs and educational opportunities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians who have been denied passage are not necessarily those who
served years in Israeli prisons for political charges. Instead, the factor that determines
who enters and who stays out is the individual&#146;s position toward the Peace Process,
its fairness and whether it introduces a just solution. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such a reality has served for years as a line that has segregated
Palestinians based on their varied perspectives and stands. V.I.P. cards, granted to
Palestinian officials and other favoured individuals, were often criticized by the
Palestinian people. Thousands of students and unemployed workers had to hopelessly remain
in their homes while these officials were free to travel every day to Israel and the West
Bank with or without sufficient reasons. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps finding a solution to such a problem was one of the few points
that all Palestinians have agreed upon. Most Palestinians, especially those residing in
the Gaza Strip area (Gaza is in greater need for the West Bank than the West Bank is for
Gaza because the West Bank holds a larger job market, most educational institutions, and
it also borders Jordan), truly longed for the day in which they could freely and without
fear cross to the other side of what they perceive as a one national entity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the recent talks regarding these safe passages were initiated between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Palestinians were in a state of excitement and
disbelief for two important reasons. First, thousands of Palestinians had to stand in the
rain and cold or the blazing sun every day in long lines at Israeli checkpoints, holding
their cards in their trembling hands. It was truly exciting, regardless of the political
implications, to simply cross the borders without permits, never-ending lines, without
insults from the soldiers and certainly without the fear of rejection or arrest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second reason that ignited Palestinian excitement and overwhelming joy
is the innocent assumption that the passage was granted the title &#147;safe&#148; because
they would finally be able to &#147;safely&#148; cross the Israeli borders. While the
safety and security of Israelis and Jewish settlers in the West bank and Gaza was the
ultimate concern of the Israeli government and the United States peace brokers, Israel,
for the first time, acknowledged the need for safety and security for Palestinians as
well, or so they thought.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just a few days after the arrangements for the safe passage were
completed, a great deal of Palestinian enthusiasm quickly faded. Palestinians discovered
that Israel&#146;s ultimate concern was for the safety of Israelis, indeed not
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under the safe passage agreement, although every Palestinian is eligible
in principle, Israel reserves the right to grant or deny any Palestinian the privilege of
utilizing the route.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians still must apply for a permit to &#147;freely&#148; move
between the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian officials will collect these applications and
submit them to Israel, which will have the final say in who can freely move and who
cannot. Israel will also have the right to close or open the passage according to its
security needs. In fact, the passage is only opened from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. for Palestinian
traffic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the crossing-over procedure is compared before and after the opening of
the passage, a striking finding will emerge. There are no real differences between the
previous and current practices, save the expiration dates of the permits. While in the
past permits were granted for a few months, few days or few hours, now permits will be
valid for a whole year. Unfortunately, even that advantage is also controlled by Israel,
for it can simply invalidate any of these permits through its computerized methods at any
time after their endorsements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Any gains attained by Palestinians, no matter how insignificant, are still
significant, as the only real power that the PA has is pleading with the international
community to pressure Israel. Yet, driving Palestinians to believe that their needs will
finally be met every time talks resume will eventually hurt the relationship between the
PA and the people. For, as always, hopeful expectations turn out to be just another
disappointing and unpleasant reality. Consequently, this frequent disappointment will
surely lead to a complete loss of faith in both the peace process and the peace processors
themselves.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The intellectuals&#146; lack of rectitude</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Khalid Amayreh</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It seems that rectitude has become a rare commodity among many of the
so-called Palestinian &#147;returnee&#148; writers and poets, especially those who had
been moulded by the &#147;Beirut syndrome&#148;, the main features of which include
excessive leftist secularism and hostility toward Islamist activism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of late, some of these &#147;revolutionary&#148; or
&#147;nationalist&#148; intellectuals have been rallying in defense of the Lebanese
Communist singer, Marcel Khalifa, after a Lebanese judge served a summons on him for
&#147;offending religious sensibilities&#148; following the release of one of his songs in
which he used a verse from the Holy Qur&#146;an. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The controversial summons received widespread denunciation, in particular
from Arab writers and intellectuals. Even some Islamic authorities, such as the Lebanese
Shiite polymath Muhammed Baqer al-Sader, voiced reservations concerning the summons,
opining that the use by Khalifa of a Qur&#146;anic verse in his song did not undermine the
sanctity of Islam&#146;s holy book.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the matter did not stop there, where it should have. Several
Palestinian &#147;intellectuals&#148; and writers, including poets, artists and
journalists, who often act as obsequious mouthpieces for Yasser Arafat&#146;s autocratic
Palestinian Authority, took advantage of the largely anomalous incident in Beirut to
launch a vitriolic onslaught against Islamic revival.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Using vindictive labels and almost venomous phraseology, they attacked
political Islam as &#147;a dark force hounding progressive and free intellectuals.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even the virtually moribund Palestinian Journalists Association, which is
reputed more for its enduring dormancy and inaction and much less for its defense of
freedom of expression, joined the chorus of Islam-bashers, calling the Lebanese judge
&#147;a representative of the dark forces in the Middle East.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But is Islamic revivalism a dark force? Indeed, is Islam itself a dark
force opposed to modernity and freedom of thought? Or, to put it more frankly and
succinctly, is any thought or ideology, or ism dark or negative if it does not conform
with the leftist, internationalist, Leninist-Marxist thought? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is amply clear that this mostly tribal solidarity with Khalifa does not
stem from genuine concerns for freedom of expression and thought in the face of
authoritarianism and despotism. (Since when do Communists have faith in freedom of
thought? What happened to Trotsky?)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, if the defenders of Khalifa had been motivated by ethical
concerns, not by parochial partisan or ideological considerations, we would have seen them
say a word or two in defense of Yasser Arafat&#146;s odious despotism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given the fuss about Khalifa, one is prompted to ask the pseudo,
self-proclaimed defenders of &#147;freedom of thought&#148; the following questions:
&#147;What do you do when Yasser Arafat, your President, concentrates the executive,
legislative and judicial powers in his hands, and sends Palestinian intellectuals and
political activists to jails for prolonged periods of time, without charge or trial? Do
you ever voice even a gesture of dissatisfaction with the Chairman, who holds all the
reins, takes all the decisions, and controls all the money, when he rapes the rule of law
and orders judges to &#145;shut up&#146; or else he will make sure they are fired? Indeed,
are you not just faithful followers of Sa&#146;adi&#146;s adage, &#145;when money appears,
heads bow&#146;?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your deafening silence in the face of the human rights disaster and
strangulation of basic freedoms and civil liberties under Arafat&#146;s despotic rule is
suspicious, tendentious and unacceptable. It simply does not allow us to give you the
benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, there is no escaping judging you as merely practitioners of
&#147;moral selectiveness, duplicity, cowardice, even hypocrisy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let me remind you of just two incidents which took place in our country of
late.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two weeks ago, the Palestinian High Court of Justice ordered the executive
authority, e.g. the PA leadership, to release Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi from a Gaza
lock-up where he had been (and continues to be) interned for &#147;opposing the peace
process&#148; and &#147;voicing harsh criticisms of the PA.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA, to put it more correctly, Arafat (since he is the PA) utterly
ignored the ruling, and his Gaza police chief, Ghazi al-Jabali, argued, with an imperious
voice, that &#147;the Palestinian national interest was above all court orders,&#148;
adding that, &#147;I&#146;m answerable to Yasser Arafat, not to the High Court of
Justice!!!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similarly, the same court issued another ruling on 13 October, ordering
the Preventive Security Force (PSF) in Nablus to immediately free 34 college students from
political internment at the Jeneid prison.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the students have been in incarcerated for two years, again
without charge or trial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, the PSF dumped this court&#146;s order into the same trash
can in which numerous other court orders had been deposited, prompting judges and jurists,
such as Ibrahim Abu Sharar, to lament the &#147;loss of the rule of law in our
country.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I would like to ask you, our esteemed intellectuals, haven&#146;t these
developments been sufficient to kindle a red light in your minds and thoughts? Why
haven&#146;t you cried out and risen up for freedom, justice and the rule of law, without
which any society will plunge into chaos and degeneration?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Is it because the victims in Gaza and Nablus belong to a tribe not of your
own? Or is it because you are infested with ideological obliquity ? Don&#146;t you know
that fanatics, can&#146;t be true intellectuals, because they don&#146;t hold ideas but
are held by ideas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, moral and intellectual honesty mandates that a writer,
poet or intellectual he may be, must be un-selective in his judgement. Hence, voicing
support for and solidarity with Marcel Khalifa, if indeed it stems from genuine, ethical
considerations for intellectual freedom, should also stir up your conscience to identify
with the oppressed prisoners of conscience in our collective Palestinian house.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Until and unless you do that, the echo of your words, the luster of your
thoughts and the messages both carry, will be lacking moral authenticity.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>Flora Nicoletta*</strong></em></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza Strip</b> - The first time I met him, it was in 1998 in July. He had
been released three days from prison. He is sweet, soft-spoken and always joyful and
smiling. He lives in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Shaykh Khalil is an unmarried,
25-year-old member of Hamas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Many people came to visit me after my release, but nobody said he
was Hamas. In the <i>zinzana </i>(isolation cell), I was always smiling to the soldiers
every time they opened the door. Eventually they liked the man who was smiling to them in
the <i>zinzana</i>. One of them even came to visit me at home.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The first time I was arrested was in April 1995 by the <i>mukhabarat
</i>(intelligence service). They came to my home at 4 o&#146;clock in the morning. At that
time, the Palestinian Authority (PA) was newly established and their behaviour towards us
was very cleaver, not like now. In a polite way, they said they wanted me for five
minutes. The PA was new to this kind of job; they respected us; they did not beat us; they
did not push us. There were around 20 men from Amin El-Hindi&#146;s General Intelligence.
All my friends were arrested the same night. I asked them: &#147;Where is Rajib?&#148;,
because logically Rajib, too, should be arrested with me.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They asked us to look for the keys of the cells. They gave us a
dozen keys and we had to find which key opened which door. We were joking with them: we
took one as hostage and kept him handcuffed until an officer came to tell us it was not
the right way to deal with a soldier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I was freed after two weeks, others after one month. It was the
first wave of mass arrests following two (suicide) bombings near Kfar Darom and Netzarim
settlements. They arrested around 400 people from the Gaza Strip. We asked ourselves what
was happening. I said to my friends that if they started this way, the second time they
would be harsher, the third more and more till they reach this very moment. The point
reached today is similar to the Israeli occupation before and during the Intifada: the
same jails, the same cells, the same methods and even the same food. It&#146;s an exact
photocopy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;At the beginning, they were joking with us. They wanted to show they
were not against us, but rather they protected us because Israel wanted to kill a number
of us. They wanted us to believe it was not because we belonged to Hamas that they
captured us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Es-Saraya (or Gaza Central Prison in Gaza City) is a large prison
with more than 200 cells. At that time it was big enough for all the detainees. They asked
us only a few questions: &#145;When did you become involved with Hamas? How do you see the
situation after Oslo? Do you support the operations against the Israelis in Gaza, against
the settlers?&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The second time I was arrested was in March of 1996, after the four
(suicide) bomb attacks in Israel. It was an extremely difficult period for us, actually,
because they started to behave like tigers devouring their prey. They came at 11 p.m.,
around ten soldiers from Musa Arafat&#146;s Military Intelligence. Before the
establishment of the PA, these men (former revolutionaries) were a dream for the
Palestinian people; nowadays, all the people hate them. They took me; they beat me, and I
was subjected to a dozen interrogation sessions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In the jail there were two isolation cells measuring 40 cm x 40 cm.
They dumped me in one of them for three days. I want to ask all people how one can stay in
40 cm x 40 cm? It&#146;s like what? Like a pipe. How can you stay there? And without a
window! If I asked to go to the bathroom, maybe the guard would say no, or he would
approve only after five minutes or even one hour. When I refused to answer their
questions, they threw me there. They beat me with sticks and cables and threw me in this <i>zinzana</i>
every time I refused to answer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Remembering that time is very painful, and I thank God because I did
not become foolish. Even the day before our release, they interrogated us. Jibril and I
spent 70 days in a normal cell and 70 nights in the <i>zinzana</i>. All in all, we
languished for four months in Musa Arafat&#146;s jail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They hung me from the ceiling by my wrists. My hands were tied
behind my back and I was hung to the ceiling...from six in the evening until three in the
morning. It&#146;s a very long time... Those were the tortures of the day and the tortures
of the night. During the night, they tortured more than during the day. In the day, they
beat you with sticks and plastic pipes and your head is covered with a stinking sack. Each
group of three guards or more is busy with a sole detainee and they hit the sensitive
parts of the body: the thighs, the back. Look at my ankles!! They hit you until they
don&#146;t see blood on your back, your thighs. They put your hand on the table and hit
your fingers with a ruler. They didn&#146;t beat me on the genitals, but I have seen
another prisoner with blood there.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These are the routine tortures. There is no connection at all with
the questions; they first use routine tortures. The place is called an investigation room.
In every room there is a prisoner and three or four investigators, but they are not real
investigators. In the daytime, it happens this way: in the morning, they take you from the
<i>zinzana</i> and put you in the investigation room. They ask a few questions and then
they torture. There is not any welcome with coffee or tea, they welcome you with torture.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Even if the prisoner falls unconscious, they want him to recover in
order to get the information they are seeking. So he is dumped in the<i> zinzana</i> with
his head covered or not, it depends. No light, a black and narrow cell with an unbearable
smell: 40 cm x 40 cm or 1 m 50 x 40 cm. But if to be in the <i>zinzana</i> is terrible, to
be in the investigation room is worse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In Es-Saraya there are plenty of long corridors with a large number
of doors. If after being kept in the <i>zinzana </i>the prisoner doesn&#146;t speak, they
tie his hands behind his back and hang him by the wrists to one of the doors. His toes
don&#146;t touch the floor and he cannot move, otherwise they will come and beat him. If
they hear some noise, they come running and hit you. And every time the investigators pass
in the corridors, they torture you. I suffered a lot at that time and asked God to relieve
me.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The third time I was arrested it was at the end of last year. I
spent the first six months in isolation and then another two in the normal cell. This
time, too, I was detained by the Military Intelligence. Only the Qur&#146;an was permitted
in jail; now I know it by heart. The pen was forbidden. Musa Arafat forbids even the
masbaha (Muslim rosary). Only in his jail the masbaha is forbidden. Sometimes you cannot
keep with you even the toothbrush. By these means, they want to push our people to leave
the organization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;My friend Jamil was in the <i>zinzana </i>near mine for a period. We
used to speak from under the door. We were dreaming.&#133; We were dreaming to go to the
beach to eat roasted fish and rice once released. That time I was in an isolation cell 1 m
80 x 1 m 50. Under the Israeli occupation, there was a Turkish toilet and a shower. Many
have become foolish there because of the jinn (demon). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This third imprisonment was extremely, extremely harsh and also
extremely long. Imagine six months in the <i>zinzana.</i> In addition, I could not see my
family for eight months. It&#146;s a form of psychological torture. The second detention
was harsh because of the physical torture, the third for the psychological torture. In
both cases, it was very hard, and in both cases, it was in Musa Arafat&#146;s jail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Palestinians used to be kept in jail without charge or trial
more than the Israelis did. There is no law; the PA has no law. The Israelis could not
detain us for more than 18 days without seeing a judge [sic], but the Palestinians are
doing what they want. During the occupation, when one was brought before a court, his
family should be present [sic], but now the Palestinians simply say, &#145;You take 15
years&#146; and we don&#146;t need a trial. The Israeli laws were better for us than those
of our own Authority. Ask my friends here present: all of them have been arrested like me,
all of them have been tortured like me, all of them have been treated like me. We even
shared all of us the same room.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajib: &#147;When I was in the Israeli jails, I felt respect and dignity,
honour and glory because I was a hero and I suffered for the sake of my homeland and my
promising future. But in PA jails, I feel humiliation, frustration and psychological
destruction because they consider me a traitor: I was accused of jeopardizing the creation
of the Palestinian State!! Under the Israeli rule, I knew the laws, but the Palestinian
justice is like a labyrinth&#151;you know nothing. When you enter jail, you&#146;re dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They pass to the Israelis the information extorted under torture
from the prisoners. For us, they are only one enemy. When we fight them, we fight Israel:
the tail is here, the head there.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, Khalil, Rajib, their brothers and friends are all in prison. </p>

of Islam and the West</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</b><i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Mohommed A. Muqtedar Khan</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  </i><b><p ALIGN="center">( 1-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The end of history and the triumphal West</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the major themes that is reshaping the discourse on international
relations in the post-Cold War era is the emerging challenge of resurgent Islam to the
global hegemony&#151;material as well as intellectual&#151;of the West. After the initial
euphoria about the emergence of the West as the winner, not just in the Cold War but also
&#147;in history,&#148; the &#147;new fear&#148; that is now shaping Western destiny and
identity is Islam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The end of the Cold War precipitated basically a three-stage response in
the United States. This brief paper explains an emerging post-Cold War agenda in the West,
using what Nietzsche defined as the ethic of resentment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first response was the celebration of Western victory and by
association that of American and Western values. This was followed by a more sober
reexamination of the self and its relation to the new global scenario. This healthy
rethinking is still going on, as most scholars and policy makers seek to re-justify or
redefine existing institutions and policies. A similarly global movement toward
introspection replaced the initial euphoria as people sought solutions to problems
hitherto marginalized while the world stood silently as the two super powers struggled for
supremacy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, Francis Fukuyama, playing to
the triumphant jingoism in the West, declared that history had come to an end and we were
now a witness to the emergence of the &#147;Last Man&#148; (1). His analysis was based on
the Hegelian idea of a universal history progressing through a dialectic between ideas
until the ultimate triumph of liberal democracy as the final destiny of humanity. He made
it interesting by arguing that &#147;this dialectic takes place not only on the level of
philosophical discussions, but between societies&#148; and the ideologies which constitute
these societies (2). Thus, in winning the Cold War, the West had achieved a victory for
itself and its ideas. He is also implicitly laying claim to Western history being the
Universal History of Man. And since Fukuyama sees no further challenge to liberal
democracy or to the West and its global material and intellectual domination, <i>voila</i>!
The End of History and the Last Man is here. In his analysis of the resurgence of Islam
(3), Fukuyama contends that Islam&#146;s days of cultural conquests are over. He asserts
that it may win back lapsed adherents but has no resonance in Berlin, Tokyo or Moscow.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But other scholars, and an intransigent history itself, do not seem to
share Fukuyama&#146;s sanguine triumphalism. The growing conflicts between emerging ethnic
identities, the redrawing of fault lines of economic and political regionalism,
accompanied by a global resurgence of religion and its increasing impact on the
contemporary course of history, not only disagree but make a mockery of Fukuyama&#146;s
supercilious declarations about the end of history. The most interesting development, in
the context of this argument, is the global resurgence of most religions, not just Islam
(4). The resurgence of religion is a witness to the continuing presence of human
existential anxieties. The rampant consumerism of market economies, the superficial
liberty of democracy, and the synthetic homogenization/equality of modernity have failed
to curb the human desire to seek a transcendent meaning and purpose to life and history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This analysis is indeed a vote of no confidence in the present
institutions which purport to operationalize democracy and respect for equality in the
West (5). A survey of the condition of ethnic, religious and racial minorities in the
West&#151;Turks in Germany, Arabs in France and blacks in America&#151;will sufficiently
emphasize the hollowness of any claims about the triumph of liberal democracy. Foreign
policy analysts such as Rober Lieber are concerned that the absence of an external enemy
might weaken the Western alliance (6), suggesting perhaps that it was more the enemy
without that gave the West its reasons to cooperate than the assertion of its
&#147;self&#148; and the values that constitute that common self. From Lieber&#146;s
concerns it can be discerned that Western cooperation, unity and its very identity as the
&#147;West&#148; are purely instrumental and not a consequence of common values or the
dialectics of history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In response to the fears that in the absence of a &#147;self-defining
other&#148; the internal cohesiveness of Western States and their external alliances will
degenerate, some Western scholars have ended their hunt for this new &quot;other&quot; by
selecting Islam, or its resurgent political element&#151;fundamentalist/political/radical
Islam (7). For those who are cynical of Western interpretations of history, this
conclusion that Islam is the new threat to the West seems both silly and ridiculous. First
of all, it is amusing to see how this superficial analysis reverses one of the
constitutive elements of modernity and Western philosophy&#151;that history is linear and
progressive. If history is indeed a dialectic progression of ideas, then the return of the
old dialectic&#151;West/Islam, Occident/Orient, modern/traditional, democracy/aristocracy,
science/religion&#151;suggests a radical departure toward a cyclical nature of history,
for had not history progressed beyond this dialectic to the new one between Capitalism and
Communism, both modern categories? For more than 500 years, Islam was the quintessential
&#147;other&#148; that was used as the yard stick to define and redefine the West and its
values. For a brief moment in history, half a century, the Soviets had usurped
Islam&#146;s traditional role as the threat to the West. But Samuel Huntington&#146;s
argument that future conflicts will be between civilizations and not States has once again
put history into dialectical motion with Islam and the West as the primary protagonists
(8).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<u><font color="#0000FF"><b>The Ethic of Resentment</b></font></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The re-emergence of the fear of Islam in the West cannot be explained
through superficial analysis about the nature of history and/or arguments about the nature
of physical security in the post-Cold War era. An answer to this question lies in a more
fundamental and philosophical explanation of the origin and conception of self in the
West. Edward Said in his famous critique of Orientalism argued that for the West the study
of the Orient was essentially a process of developing the self. By creating an Orient as
the &#147;other,&#148; Western values were defined both in opposition and as superior to
Oriental values. Therefore, through various discursive practices, Orientalism created an
Orient that was antithetical and inferior to the West (9). Thus, according to Said, the
idea of Western identity is based more on exogenous elements, the inferiority, even
barbarity, of the Orient rather than on anything intrinsic to the West itself. Indeed,
Said further argues that this practice of constituting the Orient, especially Islam, as
the demonized &quot;other&quot; for the glorification as well as definition of the self is
still very much alive (10).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nietzsche identifies two kinds of ethics&#151;the ethic of nobility and
the ethic of resentment in his book entitled <i>On the Genealogy of Morals</i> (11). The
ethic of resentment, Nietzsche argues, is a creative and idealistic morality. It is the
consequence of the resentment and hatred of the slave toward his master or his oppressor.
He suggests: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Slave morality from the outset says, &#147;No,&#148; to what is
  &#147;outside,&#148; what is &#147;different,&#148; what is &#147;not itself,&#148; and
  this &#147;No&#147; is its creative deed (12).</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Slave morality always first needs a hostile external world; it needs,
  physiologically speaking, external stimuli in order to act at all&#151;its action is
  fundamentally reaction (13).</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his ruthless analysis, Nietzsche concludes that the one with the ethic
of resentment conceives of the &#147;evil enemy,&#148; which is precisely his deed of
creation, and from this basic creation he himself evolves, as an afterthought, as a
&#147;good one&#148; himself (14). Nietzsche attributes the genesis of the ethic of
resentment to the Jews who for 2,000 years, according to him, meted out their revenge to
satisfy their hatred of their oppressors. Interestingly, while Nietzsche is rather rough
on the Jewish people, he is also clear that this ethic of resentment has pervaded and
overwhelmed Christian as well as modern Western philosophy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This contrasts with the noble whose morality develops from an assertion of
self. Bryan Turner describes this aristocratic equation as good = beautiful = happy =
loved by Gods, whereas the ethic of resentment reverses this equation as the
&#147;wretched,&#148; the lowly, alone are good (15). Thus Nietzsche, after distinguishing
the ethic of resentment from the ethic of nobility, juxtaposes Islam and Christianity on
opposite sides of this ethical divide. He argues that Christianity, by inculcating the
slave morality &#147;robbed humanity of the harvest of the culture of the ancient world
and Islam,&#148; because they were noble and based their identities on the assertion of
the self and not through a demonization of the other (16).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bryan Turner, however, provides an interesting twist to this entire
debate. He asserts that there are three distinct civilizational antecedents to the present
modern world. These are the Hellenistic, the Islamic and the Judeo-Christian. He argues
that contemporary construction of the origin of modernity in a progressive sequence
(Hellenistic&#150;Islam [as a neutral
transmitter]-Judeo-Christian-enlightenment&#150;Modern) allows Western scholars to connect
scientific freedom and political democracy (17). In my opinion, it also allows Western
scholars to claim the progress of history for the West and deny others&#151;especially
Islam&#151;any credit for the development of human civilization. It also sustains the
self-other relationship between the West and Islam. To attribute anything positive to
Islam would corrupt this Islam-free construction of the evolution of modern history and
modern values. This is clearly a manifestation of the ethic of resentment at work. Turner
further problematizes the general understanding of the philosophical development of modern
values. He argues that, contrary to Said&#146;s contention that Orientalism was all
negative, a thin, but nevertheless important, strain of positive Orientalism did emerge.
This positive Orientalism, according to Turner, posited Islam as superior to Christianity
in terms of monotheism and rationality and was used to critique Christian theology. He
advances an analysis of Hume&#146;s and Nietzsche&#146;s treatment of Islam as support for
his contentions (18).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having understood the distinction between the ethic of resentment and the
ethic of nobility, we must now tackle the relevance of this philosophical distinction to
Islam and the West. The ethics of resentment evidently continues to inform Western
perceptions of Islam and itself. The search for a &#147;new enemy,&#148; the need for an
&#147;other&#148; to sustain internal cohesion (19) and external effectiveness (20)
suggests that the ethic of resentment is still at work. More than this mere search for a
new enemy, the proliferation of literature on Islam and democracy, on Islam and civil
society, on Islam and fundamentalism, and on Islam and women emerge as the West itself is
confronting the problems of civil society, domestic terrorism, crime and domestic
ungovernability, and the growth of feminist movements that challenge the status quo. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF"><big>Jewish Fundamentalism Within Jewish Society</big></font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Almost every moderately sophisticated Israeli Jew knows the facts about
Israeli Jewish society that are described in this book. These facts, however, are unknown
to most interested Jews and non-Jews outside Israel who do not know Hebrew and thus cannot
read most of what Israeli Jews write about themselves in Hebrew. These facts are rarely
mentioned or are described inaccurately in the enormous media coverage of Israel in the
United States and elsewhere. The major purpose of this book is to provide those persons
who do not read Hebrew with more understanding of one important aspect of Israeli Jewish
society.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This hook pinpoints the political importance of Jewish fundamentalism in
Israel, a powerful state in and beyond the Middle East that wields great influence in the
United States. Jewish fundamentalism is here briefly defined as the belief that Jewish
Orthodoxy, which is based upon the Babylonian Talmud, the rest of talmudic literature and
halachic literature, is still valid and will eternally remain valid. Jewish
fundamentalists believe that the Bible itself is not authoritative unless interpreted
correctly by talmudic literature. Jewish fundamentalism exists not only in Israel but in
every country that has a sizeable Jewish community. In countries other than Israel,
wherein Jews constitute a small minority of the total population, the general importance
of Jewish fundamentalism is limited mainly to acquiring funding and garnering political
support for fundamentalist adherents in Israel. Its importance in Israel is far greater,
because its adherents can and do influence the state in various ways. The variety of
Jewish fundamentalism in Israel is striking. Many fundamentalists, for instance, want the
temple rebuilt on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem or at least want to keep the site, which
is now a holy Muslim praying place, empty of visitors. In the United States most
Christians would not identify with such a purpose, but in Israel a significant number of
Israeli Jews who are not fundamentalists identify with and support this and similar
demands. Some varieties of Jewish fundamentalism are clearly more dangerous than others.
Jewish fundamentalism is not only capable of influencing conventional Israeli policies but
could also substantially affect Israeli nuclear policies. The same possible consequences
of fundamentalism feared by many persons for other countries could occur in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The significance of fundamentalism in Israel can only be understood within
the context of Israeli Jewish society and as part of the contribution of the Jewish
religion to societal internal divisions. Our consideration of this broad topic begins by
focusing upon the ways sophisticated observers divide Israeli Jewish society politically
and religiously. We then proceed to the explanation of why Jewish fundamentalism
influences in varying<i> </i>degrees other Israeli Jews, thereby allowing fundamentalist
Jews to wield much greater political power in Israel than their percentage of the
population might appear to warrant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The customary two-way division of Israeli Jewish society rests upon the
cornerstone recognition that as a group Israeli Jews are highly ideological. This is best
evidenced by their high percentage of voting, which usually exceeds 80 per cent. In the
May 1996 elections, over 95 percent of the better educated, richer, secular Jews and the
religious Jews in all categories of education and income voted. After discounting the
large number of Israeli Jews who live outside Israel (over 400,000), most of whom did not
vote, it can be safely assumed that almost every eligible voter in these two crucial
segments of the population voted. Most Israeli political observers by now assume that
Israeli Jews are divided into two categories: Israel A and Israel B. Israel A, often
referred to as the &quot;left,&quot; is politically represented by the Labor and Meretz
Parties; Israel B, referred to as the &quot;right&quot; or the &quot;right and religious
parties,&quot; is comprised of all the other Jewish parties. Almost all of Israel A and a
great majority of Israel B (the exception being some of the fundamentalist Jews) strongly
adhere to Zionist ideology, which in brief, holds that all or at least the majority of
Jews should emigrate to Palestine, which as the Land of Israel, belongs to all Jews and
should be a Jewish state. A strong and increasing enmity between these two segments of
Israeli society nevertheless exists. There are many reasons for this enmity. The reason
relevant to this study is that Israel B, including its secular members, is sympathetic to
Jewish fundamentalism while Israel A is not. It is apparent from studies of election
results over a long period of time that Israel B has consistently obtained a numerical
edge over Israel A. This is an indication that the number of Jews influenced by Jewish
fundamentalism is consistently increasing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his article &quot;Religion, Nationalism and Democracy in Israel,&quot;
published in the Autumn 1994 issue of the periodical, <i>Z'<b> </b>Manim </i>(no. 50-51),
Professor Baruch Kimmerling, a faculty member of Hebrew University's sociology department,
presented data pertaining to the religious division of Israeli Jewish society. Citing</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">numerous research studies, Kimmerling showed conclusively that Israeli
Jewish society is far more divided on religious issues than is generally assumed outside
of Israel, where belief in generalizations, such as &quot;common to all Jews,&quot; is
challenged less than in Israel. Quoting the data of a survey taken by the prestigious
Gutman Institute of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Kimmerling pointed out that
whereas 19 per cent of Israeli Jews said they prayed daily, another 19 per cent declared
that they would not enter a synagogue under any circumstances. Influenced by the Gutman
Institute analysis and similar studies, Kimmerling and other scholars have concluded that
Israel A and Israel B contain hard-core believers who hold diametrically opposed views of
the Jewish religion. This conclusion is almost certainly correct.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More generally, the attitude towards religion in Israeli Jewish society
can be divided into three parts. The religious Jews observe the commandments of the Jewish
religion, as defined by Orthodox rabbis, many of whom emphasize observance more than
belief. (The number of Reform and/or Conservative Jewish in Israel is small.) The
traditional Jews keep some of the more important commandments while violating the more
inconvenient ones; they do honor the rabbis and the religion. The secularists may
occasionally enter a synagogue but respect neither the rabbis nor the religious
institutions. The line between traditional and secular Jews is often vague, but the
available studies indicate that 25 to 30 per cent of Israeli Jews are secular, 50 to 55
per cent are traditional and about 20 per cent are religious. Traditional Jews obviously
belong to both the Israel A and Israel B categories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli religious Jews are divided into two distinctly different groups.
The members of the religiously more extreme group are called Haredim. (The singular word
is Haredi or Hared.) The members of the religiously more moderate group are called
religious-national Jews. The religious-national Jews are sometimes called &quot;knitted
skullcaps&quot; because of their head covering. Haredim usually wear black skullcaps that
are never knitted, or hats. The religious-national Jews otherwise usually dress in the
more usual Israeli fashion, while the Haredim almost always wear black clothes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haredim are themselves divided into two parties. 'The first, Yahadut
Ha'Torah (Judaism of the Law) is the party of the Ashkenazi Haredim who are of East
European origin. Yahadut Ha'Torah itself is a coalition of two factions. The second is
Shas, the part of the Oriental Haredim who are of Middle Eastern origin. The
religious-national Jews are organized in the National Religious Party NRP). By analyzing
the 1996 electoral vote and making some necessary adjustments, we can estimate the
population percentages of these two groups of religious Jews. In the 1996 election the
Haredi parties together won 14 of the 120 total Knesset seats. Shas won ten sears; Yahadut
Ha' Torah won four. The NRP won nine seats. Some Israeli Jews admittedly voted for Shas
because of talismans and amulets distributed by Shas that were supposedly valid only after
a &quot;correct&quot; vote. Some NRP members and sympathizers, moreover, admittedly voted
for secular right-wing parties. Everything considered,<sub> </sub>the Haredim probably
constitute<b> </b>11 per cent of the Israeli population and 13.4 percent of the Israeli
Jews; the NRP adherents probably constitute 9 per cent of the Israeli population and 11
per cent of the Israeli Jews. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The basic tenets of the two groups of religious Jews need some
introductory explanation. The word &quot;hared&quot; is a common Hebrew word meaning
&quot;fearful.&quot; During early Jewish history, it meant &quot;God-fearing&quot; or
exceptionally devout. In the mid-nineteenth century it was adopted, first in Germany and
Hungary and later in other parts of the diaspora, as the name of the party of religious
Jews that opposed any modern innovation. The Ashkenazi Haredim emerged as a backlash group
opposed to the Jewish enlightenment in general and especially to those Jews who refused to
accept the total authority of the rabbis and who introduced innovations into the Jewish
worship and life style. Seeing that almost all Jews accepted these innovations, the
Haredim reacted even more extremely and banned every innovation. The Haredim to date have
insisted upon the strictest observance of the Halacha. An illustrative example of
opposition to innovation is the previously mentioned and still current black dress of the
Haredim; this was the dress fashion of Jews in Eastern Europe when the Haredim formed
themselves into a party. Before that rime Jews dressed in many different styles and were
often indistinguishable in dress from their neighbors. After a brief rime, almost all Jews
except for the Haredim again dressed differently. The Halacha, moreover, does not enjoin
Jews to dress in black and/or to wear thick black coats and heavy fur caps during the hot
summer or at any other time. Yet, Haredim in Israel continue to do so in opposition to
innovation; they insist that dress be kept as it was in Europe around 1850. All other
considerations, including climatic ones, are overridden. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In contrast to the Haredim, the religious-nationalist Jews of the NRP made
their compromises with modernity at the beginning of the 1920s when the split between the
two large groupings in religious Judaism first appeared in Palestine. This can be
immediately observed in their dress, which, with the exception of a small skullcap, is
conventional. Even more importantly, this is evident in their selective observance of the
Halacha, for example, in their rejection of many commandments regarding women. NRP members
do not hesitate to admit women to positions of authority in many of their organizations
and in the political party itself. Before both the 1992 and 1996 elections the NRP
published and distributed an advertisement, containing photographs of various public
figures including some women supporting the party, and boasted more broadly on television
of female support. Haredim did not and would not do this. Even when Haredim, who ban
television watching for themselves, decided to present some television election programs
directed to other Jews<sub>3 </sub>they insisted that all participants be male. During the
1992 campaign the editors of a Haredi weekly consulted the rabbinical censor about whether
or not to publish the above-mentioned NRP advertisement. The rabbinical censor ordered the
paper to publish the advertisement with all photographs of the NRP women blotted out. The
editors did what the censor ordered. Outraged, the NRP sued the newspaper for libel and
sought damages in Israeli secular courts, disregarding the rulings of Haredi rabbis
prohibiting using secular courts to settle disputes among Jews.</p>

Of Our Signs: for He<br>

And seeth (all things).</i> Holy<br>
Koran, Sura XVll<br>
<br>
One of the greatest events in early Islam happened one night when Prophet Muhammed (pbuh)
traveled from Mecca to the hill of Moriah, where the Dome of the Rock is situated. From a
rock inside the Dome, he ascended through the sphere of heavens.<br>
His eventful night journey to Jerusalem in Arabic is called, Al-Isra and the
Prophet&#146;s ascent to Heaven in Arabic is Al-Mi&#146;raj. The journey began when the
angel Gabriel woke up Prophet Muhammed. The archangel brought a white horse-like creature
with wings, which was quick in<br>
speed. The Prophet rode it and it carried him to Jerusalem.<br>
In Jerusalem, Muhammed met al the prophets including Adam, Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa
(Moses), Isa (Jesus) and Harun (Aaron). There he led them in prayer. After this, Muhammed
was taken on the same unicorn to the seven heavens. At the first heaven, Prophet Muhammed
was greeted by an angel who was guarding it. The angel told Muhammed, &#147;Blessed be thy
arrival!&#148; and then opened the gate of that heaven. There at the first heaven, he met
the prophets Jesus and John and saluted them. They then said, &#147;Good brother, blessed
be thy arrival!&#148;<br>
At the third heaven, Muhammed met prophet Joseph and saluted him. He was then greeted by
Joseph. After that he went to the fifth Heaven where he met and greeted prophet Harun
(Aaron). At the sixth Heaven he met Moses and at the seventh Heaven, he met Abraham. He
also saw Paradise and Hell. He experienced then the Divine presence of God and was given
the number of prayers that were to be ordained on all Muslim followers. At first the
number was 50, but this number was reduced to 5 daily prayers.<br>
The unbelievers questioned the authenticity of the Prophet&#146;s journey but were amazed
when Muhammed could explain in graphic detail the city of Jerusalem. He was also able to
accurately describe a caravan that he saw on his way to Jerusalem which later arrived at
Mecca.<br>
The Prophet&#146;s journey to Jerusalem and his ascent to heaven were not only memorable
events and but a unique experience and a miracle. This journey and ascent took only a part
of the night and was proof that the same God who created the heavens and the earth and all
living things and<br>
creatures is capable of doing anything He wishes.<br>
God honored Prophet Muhammed by letting him experience this extraordinary journey and
ascent and it gave the Prophet a great opportunity to see the glory of God and the
workings of the universe. It was also a boost in morale for the Prophet and even further
strengthened his faith in God.<br>
Muslims the world over observe this wondrous event and appreciate its significance and
uniqueness. Its mention in the Holy Koran proves that Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock are
sacred to Muslims as it is from this area that the prophet began his ascent to the
heavens. In fact,<br>
Al-Aqsa is the third holiest shrine in Islam after the mosques in Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Kamal Wahid and I am only 13 years old. Most boys my age in
countries where there are no wars, play football, soccer, basketball or fly kites at their
leisure. I wish that I could tell you how it feels to be a child, but I really don&#146;t
know and have not known for years what it is like to be young. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I live not too far from the West Bank city of Hebron in Al-Arrub refugee
camp. Al-Arrub is under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but let me tell
you, the people who inhabit this camp live under a double occupation. The other night,
when I was at home, some Israeli soldiers beat down my door, broke into my home and yanked
me away from my parents. Before I knew what was happening, I felt a club sink into my head
and from the newly formed gash in my skull, a fountain of blood gushed forth, soaking my
shirt and pants, running down onto the living room floor. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My mother&#146;s screams fell on the deaf ears of the Israeli policeman as
she demanded, &#147;What are you doing? He&#146;s just a boy. He&#146;s done nothing
wrong. Let him go!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Israeli club fiercely struck out, hitting her on her arm. The last
scene of home I saw was of my mother sinking to the floor in a faint, my brothers and
sisters crying, and my father valiantly attacking with his bare hands those heavily armed
soldiers closest to him. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rough hands grabbed my wrists and I was handcuffed, blindfolded and thrown
into the back of an Israeli jeep. I have never known such great fear in my life. If it
were not for the blood still gushing from the gash in my head, I would not have remembered
that I was hurt. All I could feel was this great numbness overwhelming me and a huge lump
forming in my throat as if it was going to choke me. In fact, I wish it had, for death
would have been so much better than what I am now facing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was taken to a jail, the blindfold ripped off me, the handcuffs wrenched
away, and shoved into a cell where I found seven other young Palestinians, some very badly
beaten, being held in detention. I searched for my voice. My mouth moved, but no words
seemed to come out. I tried harder and heard myself asking my fellow inmates, &#147;Why
are we here? What have we done? What are we supposed to be guilty of?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the young prisoners only moaned. One of the more able answered,
&#147;The Israelis are accusing us of belonging to Hamas. How old are you, boy?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Hamas? Me?&#148; I stuttered. &#147;I may have thrown a stone or two
at Israeli soldiers armed to the teeth, but I belong to no organization. I am too young!
I&#146;m only 13.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After talking to my fellow sufferers, I discovered that all of them ranged
in age from 18 to 20. I was the youngest but I knew that no mercy would be shown to any of
us, regardless of age. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By now, I have received many beatings. My body is covered with huge black
and blue spots where I have been clubbed. Though my torture sessions last hours, each
session seems like an eternity and I cuss that inhuman creature, towering over my small
figure, who metes out such harsh punishment on me and my newfound friends. Surely, not
even a dog should suffer what I have suffered. Sometimes I faint from torture. Sometimes I
cry. Sometimes I beg for mercy. But there is no mercy for me. What am I guilty of? All I
can think of is that I was born Palestinian and that these cruel Hitlers of today are
trying to not only take my land away from me, but my dignity as well. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I keep thinking of my mother, father, brothers and sisters. Is my mother
okay and what happened to my father when he charged into the soldiers who arrested me as a
bull would to a matador who speared him. My head wound is now festering and flies buzz
endlessly about the crusted blood and puss that continues to ooze out and thickly coat my
matted hair. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My young prison mates have said that the International Organization for
the Defense of Childhood, based in the West Bank town of Ramallah, has stated that the
Israeli army has arrested 19 other youths aged between 14 and 16 since August 1998. Mind
you, these are reported cases. And how many 17-20 year olds have been arrested? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My blood and torture is the responsibility of all Arabs. My stolen youth
has been confiscated because no Arab or Muslim leader cares what happens to children like
me. My cries and my tears are heard and seen by no one. I have not had a trial and could
be in this prison indefinitely. I wish I could just be a normal child. I so long to know
what it feels like. I so wish to be free or dead, whichever comes first. I do not think I
can bear more torture much longer, for my body is small and frail and cannot withstand the
kind of barbaric treatment that a grown man could not endure. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I do not need royal poetry read to me by someone who has never known
thirst or hunger, much less torture and incarceration. I need my freedom and to live my
life in peace where I can learn to be a child for once instead of a hunted animal. I have
committed no crime. I am guilty of nothing. And you all have my blood indelibly staining
your hands. You will never wash it off until all Palestinian children like me are free. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once upon a time in a green, green beautiful place called VP2, there lived
a flock of innocent, pure, sweet lambs. The leader of these innocent, pure, sweet lambs
was known to all far and wide as Tem Per. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tem was the best of all the little lambs in the land of VP2 and had the
densest coat of wool. Every day he would trit trot, trit trot across the bridge down to
the valley where he would then play and make all the other lambs happy, especially the
girl lambs, for he was known far and wide as a kind of Casanova. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, all the girl lambs loved Tem to flirt with them and some even
fell in love with him. This made him quite conceited, and he started to think that the
universe revolved around him and that he was very unique indeed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It came to pass one day that a Lady Troll came to settle in the place
called VP2. She was not an evil troll, but a fairly decent one. She was also a vegetarian
and when she got to know all the innocent, pure and sweet lambs in the valley, she loved
them as if they were part of her own family. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She especially liked the lamb called Tem for he would bleat nice things to
her and she figured that he was as sweet as any lamb could possibly be. Naturally, when
Lady Troll paid attention to Tem, he thought he was more important than ever and his ego
grew by leaps and bounds until his head almost fell off because it was far too heavy for
his small body. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Poor Troll! She began to love Tem with all her heart. For, after all,
wasn&#146;t he the most innocent, pure and sweet lamb she had ever known? But how much she
loved him, she knew that her love for him could never be. She was but a Lady Troll. He was
an innocent, pure, sweet lamb. So she began to search for girl lambs that would love her
Tem and take good care of him when she knew that the day would come when she had to leave
the land of VP2. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For days she cried and worried about Tem. Would he be all right, she kept
asking herself. Would he be okay without her and be able to carry on with his life? So,
she asked some of the girl lambs something like this, &#147;Hello, can you please take
care of Tem for me? Can you love him for me? I am so worried about him and need to know
that he will be okay when I leave!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When she asked a few of the most beautiful and sweetest lambs of all, they
reassured her with, &#147;Of course we will take care of him for you. Do not worry. We
will love him, too, of that you can be sure.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So the poor Lady Troll left the land of VP2 and sadly traveled back to her
former home. She felt secure, however, knowing that all the lambs in the green, green
valley would be happy without her, especially the lamb who knew that the universe revolved
around himself. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Time passed. The Troll once had thought that she would never see Tem ever
again or would ever know how he was doing. She worried and worried and thought and
thought. Her heart was aching and she felt that there was nothing in the world to stop all
the pain that raged inside her. Her face even rained blue tears and her tears, because she
cried so much, at last turned to blood. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, Tem was sad for the Troll. Who knows why really? He would
go and sit near her former homestead and just sigh and sigh all day long. Then the lambs,
innocent, pure and sweet as they were, began to spread rumours about the Troll, for she
was, after all, a troll and everyone knows that all trolls are bad! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the lambs even went so far as to say, &#147;The Lady Troll eats
lambs, and we found lamb bones at her homestead. This is proof of her guilt!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tem swallowed all the preposterous stories he heard about the Troll. He,
having thought that the universe revolved around him, became violently angry and tore up
part of the Troll&#146;s homestead. He tried to write her a few feeble letters during this
time about love and all that, but then he gave up because, after all, he did have so many
other lambs in the valley that adored him. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, the Troll was able to make a secret journey back to the
land of VP2&#133;to the green, green valley where all the innocent, pure and sweet little
lambs grazed. She just had to see all the lambs that she so dearly loved. And more than
anything, she just had to see her Tem Per. Even if it was for only one last time. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;To see him,&#148; she vowed to herself, &#147;is worth dying
for!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She ran to all the lambs with open arms, yelling all the way down to the
green, green valley in the loudest voice she could find, &#147;I&#146;m back! I&#146;m
back, I&#146;m baaaaaaaaaaccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The innocent, pure, sweet lambs hardly noticed her return for they were
hungry and would rather eat grass anytime than be bothered with a troll. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though some did tell her nonchalantly, &#147;Welcome back, Lady
Troll.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She almost stumbled and fell because of the flock&#146;s unconcern that
she had returned but she would not let that get her down because she just had to know
about her Tem. So she asked some of the lambs, who were so very busy eating, &#147;Excuse
me, have you seen Tem lately?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Green, green grass dropped out of their mouths as they chewed, and they
replied in a bothered way, &#147;Baaaaaaaaaaaa! No, we haven&#146;t seen him lately. But
we do know he used to sit in front of your homestead every day until he tore part of it
down. We don&#146;t really blame him for that because all lambs know that trolls are not
innocent, not pure and certainly never sweet! Besides, you feasted on some of us lambs and
this is unforgivable!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Her blue tears streamed down her face. She could take anything, bear
almost any pain, but she just had to know where her Tem was and if he was okay. But the
words that she had eaten some of the lambs kept echoing in the back of her mind,
especially since she was a vegetarian and never ate meat at all...and certainly not lambs!
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At last, one day after searching everywhere for her little lamb, she found
him. He had skipped all the way down to the meadow and was joking and flirting happily
with some girl lambs. Her heart beat faster and faster and all she could do was shout,
&#147;Teeeemmm! I&#146;m back!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She ran to see him. Down, down to the bottom of the valley where red
poppies grew in Flander&#146;s Fields and where jasmine smelled like heaven. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He looked up at her as if he did not recognize her and pulled another
bunch of that sweet, delicious, green, green grass up with his mouth. He began to chew and
then he remembered her. Her face seemed a bit familiar though she obviously didn&#146;t
realize that the universe revolved around him. Then he said with an irritated bleat,
&#147;Oh, you&#146;re back. Nice to see you again.&#148; And kept on chewing the green,
green grass. Just as Judas did at the Last Supper. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Had he slapped her on the face with his little lamb hoof, it would have
been better. Had he plunged a knife into her troll&#146;s heart, it would have been
easier. She just stood there frozen on the spot. Once again, tears began to stream down
her face, this time red, as red as blood. She could see the coldness in the lamb&#146;s
eyes. She could tell that she no longer mattered to him. It was as if she did not exist. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Later on, when she was able to get a word with him alone, he accused her
of many dark and horrible things. No matter how hard she tried to convince him, no matter
how she cried, no matter how bloody her tears looked, it did no good. He believed all the
ugly rumours that had been circulated after her departure. No matter how hard she pleaded,
he insisted that all trolls were evil after all and that she was nothing but a troll. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No matter that in her land she was known as the good troll and one who
fought against evil and hate. Regardless of how hard she tried, or how much she cried, she
could not convince Tem that she was innocent. She even cried beneath his wisdom like a
stone, but it was futile. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She had known him to be immature, very immature. She found out that he was
extremely self-centred. It shocked her to find out that he knew the universe to revolve
around himself. Most importantly, it hit her on the head like a sledgehammer that he never
really loved her at all. He only loved some kind of image he devised in his mind that
looked more like a young, innocent, pure, sweet lamb than her. He never failed to tell her
whenever he saw her after that that she was not innocent, she was not pure, she was not
sweet and that she was a carnivore. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Only lambs like me are innocent, pure and sweet. Trolls can never be
like lambs. Besides, you feasted on some of us lambs. How do you expect me to forget this
horrible thing that you did?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the end, Tem decided one day that he did not need Lady Troll at all. So
he took his dagger that was studded with red rubies and blue diamonds and went to her
homestead, knocked on the door and when the Troll opened the door, without one word, he
plunged the dagger deep into her heart. He kept twisting it and twisting it until he was
sure her Troll&#146;s heart no longer beat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She fell down in a pool of blood. The blood, the dead Troll and her sad
end did not bother Tem at all. In fact, all he could bleat was, &#147;I&#146;m so hungry
for more of that green, green grass in the valley. I think I&#146;ll trit trot, trit trot
down there and have more fun with the other girl lambs, especially with the blue lamb
because she is far, far better than Lady Troll and she is not a carnivore. And all the
other lambs know that the universe revolves around ME! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What you might learn from this very true story written in symbols, among
other things, is that all lambs, regardless of what they do, are innocent, pure and sweet,
and all trolls, no matter how much love they might have in their hearts for other
non-trolls, are evil and are never innocent, pure or sweet. Most important of all, the
universe really does revolve around Tem in his land of VP2! </p>
