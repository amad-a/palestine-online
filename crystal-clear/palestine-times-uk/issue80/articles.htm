<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu's statement on West Bank is in
the spirit of Oslo</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Yasser Zaatreh*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We really need to ask our fellow Palestinians who signed
or supported the Oslo Agreement (many of whom were enraged over Netanyahu's
pre-emptive proclamation that the West Bank is an integral part of 'Israel'),
since when did 'self-autonomy' as a concept begin to imply the independence
of the self-autonomous territory from the State which granted it?!  Doesn't
self-autonomy by definition merely involve the management of inhabitants,
not the land they inhabit?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We should also ask those who signed or supported Oslo exactly
where in the Agreement does it say 'withdrawal'?  Isn't the exact term used
'redeployment'?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If the text of the Oslo Agreement grants no sovereignty
on land but refers rather to the administration of the locals, what's so
odd about Netanyahu handing over to the so-called Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) only heavily populated Palestinian areas leaving for his Jewish settlers
all else?!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let's face it: when the researcher Israel Shahak commented
four years ago that Oslo was not in substance any different from the formula
of the collaborationist Village Associations (Rawabitt Al-Qurra) that 'Israel'
tried to impose on Palestinians in the 1970s, he wasn't too far off the
mark.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why Netanyahu's stonewalling doesn't really top
off that of Shimon Perez.  Both stalled for time to build or expand settlements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The same thing goes for the proportion of lands in which
the Israeli Army will be redeployed. As long as it's not heavily populated
with Palestinians, its size will increase or decrease depending on Israel's
mood, which is in turn allegedly determined by security considerations which
the Oslo Agreement gave priority to.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But then the supporters of Oslo might object that the questions
of sovereignty, settlements, borders, Jerusalem and refugees were all left
to the final status negotiations.  In fact, that is not even denied by Netanyahu.
 The real question though is whether leaving the door open for further negotiations
will necessarily mean that their outcome will be dictated by Arafat, not
the physical balance of forces on the ground that tend to favour the Israeli
leadership.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why won't those who signed that vague and loose agreement
on our behalf ask themselves what guarantees they got for attaining sovereignty,
Jerusalem, or other demands in the final status negotiations?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What are the actual pressures that will come to bear on
the Israeli leadership to cause it to respond to those demands, especially
since the Palestinian demands at stake are more or less the locus of a consensus
among different Israeli political shades, where the differences among those
shades have to do not with principle, but with the format of the self-autonomy
that will alleviate the burden of managing the Palestinians?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, we should question the current PLO leadership
about what it has now that can guarantee even the implementation of Oslo,
or lesser still, an effective response to Netanyahu's programme.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If the answer is 'nothing', then perhaps it's time for
the PLO leadership to heed the advice of its Political Officer, Farouq Al-Qadoumi,
to head right back to Tunisia.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>American, Israeli and Palestinian figures</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>debate images and realities of Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ghada Khouri*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shortly after coming into office, Israeli Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu declared that the &quot;battle for Jerusalem&quot; had
begun. Since then, the Israeli government has intensified efforts to rid
Jerusalem of its Palestinian inhabitants while consolidating exclusive Israeli
sovereignty over the Holy City. The battle is not only taking place on the
ground, but also on the airwaves, where Israeli and Palestinian officials
attempt to influence public opinion in their favour. Speaking at a conference
sponsored by the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C. on 16 January,
prominent American, Palestinian and Israeli figures came together to contrast
the realities and images of Jerusalem. While the ideas presented by the
participants varied widely, they agreed that Jerusalem remains one of the
most contentious issues between Palestinians and Israelis and that its future,
at least partly, rests over which side succeeds in winning the hearts and
minds of the American public. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Douglas Feith, co-Chairman of the Board of Advisers for
the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, epitomized the vision
of many of Israel's most ardent supporters by blaming the lack of progress
in the peace process on the Arab parties. He argued that Arab rhetoric calling
for Israel's destruction makes it impossible for Israel to make concessions.
As a result, the conflict remains an existentialist one whereby the very
survival of Israel is challenged by Arab rejectionists. Feith's depiction
of Israel as a tiny State surrounded by hostile Arab neighbours, intent
on destroying it, is all too common in the American media and the U.S. Congress.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The effectiveness of the pro-Israeli lobby in projecting
this image led to the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act passed by Congress
in 1995, a bill which outraged the Arab world. Feith justified the Act,
which calls for the relocation of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem
by 1999, as an assertion of U.S. support for Israel's right to exist and
a recognition that Jerusalem embodies the Jewish State's struggle for legitimacy.
The Act was designed to send a message to the Palestinians that their aspirations
for Jerusalem are &quot;unrealistically high,&quot; Feith said, as he dismissed
the Palestinians' legal and historical claims to the city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rashid Khalidi, President of the American Committee on
Jerusalem, sharply refuted Feith's arguments by pointing out that Arab hostility
is based on real issues and not an &quot;eternal wellspring of hostility
toward the Jews.&quot; He criticized Feith's portrayal of the Arabs as intent
on destroying Israel, pointing out that acceptance of United Nations resolution
242 by Israel's neighbours constitutes de facto recognition of Israel's
right to exist. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Khalidi, the image of Jerusalem espoused by
the U.S. Congress, the media and the public is based on several falsehoods.
He argued that the &quot;myths&quot; perpetuated by the American press,
which depict Jerusalem as the &quot;united and eternal&quot; capital of
Israel, are based on the following false assumptions: that the Israeli public
is unanimous in its belief that Jerusalem is &quot;indivisible&quot;; that
the city's current municipal boundaries are natural; and that the city is
not as important to Arabs, Muslims and Palestinians as it is to Israelis
and Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In reality, Jerusalem is a &quot;deeply divided&quot; and
&quot;segregated&quot; city where East Jerusalem is &quot;clearly Israeli-occupied
territory,&quot; Khalidi said. Citing recent public opinion surveys held
in Israel, Khalidi challenged the notion that Israelis are unyielding in
their belief that Jerusalem is the indivisible capital of Israel. He pointed
out that the current boundaries of Jerusalem are artificial in that they
were expanded by Israel to include large portions of the West Bank. Since
the boundaries of the city were changed in the past, he said, &quot;they
could be changed again.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The only viable solution to the problem of Jerusalem, according
to Khalidi, is shared sovereignty, with East Jerusalem as the capital of
a Palestinian State. Philip Wilcox, who served as Consul General in Jerusalem
during his 31-year career in the U.S. Foreign Service, agreed, pointing
out that Jerusalem is a &quot;political capital and religious centre&quot;
for both peoples. He suggested that a lasting peace must address Arab grievances
and correct the wrongs committed against the Palestinian population, half
of which was expulsed in 1948, leading to a mass refugee problem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Palestinians' legitimate claims over Jerusalem
seem to fall on deaf ears in the halls of Congress and U.S. newsrooms. The
crisis-oriented American coverage has generally failed to place the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict in perspective, often providing little analysis or historical background
to current disputes. As a result, sporadic Palestinian acts of violence
receive extensive coverage, while incremental and daily Israeli provocations
are under-reported. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab, who heads the Institute
of Modern Media at Al-Quds University, described life in Jerusalem as a
&quot;nightmare&quot; for its Palestinian residents. While any Israeli can
settle in Jerusalem at will, an unwritten Israeli policy seeks to drive
out Palestinian Jerusalemites from the city of their birth by confiscating
their residency permits. Jewish settlements, closures and Israeli-controlled
entry permits for Palestinians seeking to visit Jerusalem have effectively
severed the Holy City from the rest of the West Bank. Kuttab cited the case
of his brother-in-law, who can only visit his Jerusalemite wife by day,
then return to his home in Bethlehem by night. He is not permitted to permanently
settle in Jerusalem. In turn, his wife would lose her residency rights in
Jerusalem if she chose to move to Bethlehem. Like many Palestinian families,
the couple has fallen prey to what Khalidi calls a systematic Israeli policy
of &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Jerusalem is not only a city where Palestinians and
Israelis are deeply divided politically and psychologically. It is also
the site of a widening rift between secular Israelis and the Haredim, or
ultra-orthodox. Ori Nir, correspondent for the Israeli daily newspaper Ha'eretz,
expounded on this trend, which has led an increasing number of Israelis
to leave the Holy City to settle in more modern, secular towns such as Tel
Aviv. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to recent surveys, 51% of first-grade Israeli
children in Jerusalem are Haredim, signalling a dramatic increase in Jerusalem's
ultra-orthodox population. As a result, Jerusalem is now the second poorest
city in Israel. According to Nir, this is due to the fact that 70% of ultra-orthodox
men &quot;choose to be unemployed&quot; in order to pursue religious studies.
As a result, Jerusalemites pay the highest municipal taxes in the country
to subsidize the Haredim, who now make up the largest class of welfare recipients.
To secular Israelis like Nir, government policy aimed at altering the city's
demographic make-up comes at a high price. &quot;The best place in Jerusalem,&quot;
he said, &quot;is the exit to Tel Aviv.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As the Israeli government consolidates exclusive sovereignty
over Jerusalem by changing facts on the ground, the American media have
focused on the political demagoguery of Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
So far, the Israeli point of view has dominated the debate over the future
of Jerusalem. While the Arab parties cry foul, they have under-estimated
the power of the media in shaping American public opinion and have failed
to devote enough resources to countering the myths propagated by pro-Israeli
groups.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Loren Jenkins, a senior foreign editor at National Public
Radio and previous bureau chief of Newsweek in Beirut, blamed the one-sided
reporting on Jerusalem partly on Arab politicians' failure to effectively
present their case. He contrasted the poor performance of Arab leaders to
the savvy public relations skills of Israeli politicians, pointing out that
while Netanyahu is readily available to American journalists, obtaining
an interview with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could take days. Netanyahu's
effectivenein dealing with the media makes it difficult to &quot;find an
Arab voice that can compete at the same level,&quot; Jenkins said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The at-times heated debate, which brought to the fore the
disparity between the realities of life in Jerusalem and the images presented
in the U.S. media, left little doubt that the Israelis are decidedly on
the winning end of the battle over Jerusalem&shy;a contest with intense
repercussions over the entire Arab-Israeli peace process. As the power card
rests with Israel, winning the fight on the ground is a remote possibility
for the Palestinians. The battle taking place on the airwaves and in the
newsrooms may be the only one offering real hope of success, especially
in light of the fact that international law and the community of nations
support Palestinian claims over the Holy City, including Palestinian sovereignty
over Arab East Jerusalem. However, while Jewish lip service to Jerusalem
is backed up with substantial political and financial support to pro-Israeli
groups, Arab leaders have yet to meet the challenge of effectively countering
the myths about Jerusalem. Judging from the near absence of a concerted
Arab political strategy and media campaign on the issue of Jerusalem, critics
wonder if they are even trying. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Two Third World Examples of Democracy</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Mahmoud al Khatib</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The first example took place in Turkey last month with
the banning of the Islamic Welfare Party by the Constitutional Court.  The
secular military institution could not afford living behind the scenes,
so in order to stay in the limelight, the Turkish army leaders buried democracy
for the fourth time in the past four decades: three in military coups and
the last a semi-military coup, which resulted in the downfall of the Erbakan-led
coalition government by military pressure. Mr. Erbakan, who survived in
the prime ministry for one year, was the first Turkish, as well as worldwide,
Islamic prime minister in the aftermath of the First World War.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Erbakan's party, the largest political party in the
country (a total membership of 5 million), obtained 158 seats in the 1995
parliamentary elections leaving the True Path, the ruling party, in second
position with some 130 seats, which qualified the Welfares to form a coalition
government with Mrs. Tansu Ciller's True Path. When Mr. Erbakan came to
power, he asserted he would respect the secular regime and the political
pluralism in the country. The army leaders seeking a military alliance with
the Zionist State were afraid of democracy, not only because it could bring
Islamists to power, but also because it threatened their own interests.
They had been the actual rulers of the country over the past 60 years. The
Islamists who came to power through democracy wanted to be the actual rulers
and refused to remain in the shadows. Others, such as Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, the fragile man, accepted to play that role and to be a dummy in
the hands of the army leaders. That's why he submitted to the army chiefs
and continued his efforts to outlaw the Welfare Party, closing the religious
middle schools and imposing stricter enforcement of dress codes in the public
service, universities and schools.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the banning of the Welfare Party, which obtained more
than 6 million votes in the previous elections, and last month's decision
by the education minister banning the wearing of Hijab (Islamic dress) by
both teachers and female students in the secondary schools, will certainly
provoke the Turkish people, given that 99% of them are Muslims. Who should
be blamed if the millions of Muslim Turks, Welfares, Sufis or others went
out to the streets to protest the inhuman measures taken by Mr. Yilmaz under
pressure of the army leaders? Who should be blamed, the oppressed people
or the tyrant leaders?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Turkey is an example of a country that swings between two
worlds: the Islamic World, the natural environment for Turkey, which ruled
the Islamic World for about four centuries; and the Western World.  The
European Community has rejected all attempts made by the secular Turks to
join the European Union, not because the Turkish government, as Western
leaders say, has violated the human rights of its people, but rather because
it is a Muslim country even though it is ruled by a secular minority. Westerners
are only concerned over democracy and human rights in their countries. They
do not worry over the violations of human rights or over the non-democratic
procedures perpetrated by their allies who rule many of the Islamic countries,
especially if these procedures target Islamists and prevent them from enjoying
the fruits of democracy. Turkey and Algeria are perfect examples to this
fact.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>*****</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Algeria, a new holocaust has been committed in a savage
and primitive manner since 1992.  As in Turkey, Islamists were victims of
the impatient and greedy military institution, which could not stand seeing
an Islamic party at the top of the new democracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), a newly established
party, ran for the first parliamentary elections in Algeria in 1991.  Its
candidates swept about 80% of the parliamentary seats declared in the first
round, which infuriated the army leaders. Eventually, the army leaders forced
President Shazli Ben Jideed to abolish the results of the elections and
ban the FIS. The government escalated its measures against the party leaders
and arrested most of them. Not even that was enough. The army generals obliged
President Ben Jideed to resign when they felt he would not satisfy their
plans to crack down on the Islamists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Algerian FIS was different than Turkey's Welfare Party,
which is a moderate Islamic party that refuses to use violence against the
government. FIS covert leadership formed the Islamic Salvation Army, which
decided to confront the arbitrary measures taken by the government against
them. That was the spark that ignited the ongoing civil war in Algeria six
years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The FIS militants targeted only army soldiers, policemen
and Statesmen. In the past few months, the killings and sabotage actions
mainly targeted civilians in general and women and children in particular.
In many massacres, women and children were butchered like sheep, their bodies
ripped open with axes and swords. In some mass killings, civilians, including
infants, were burnt alive. The toll is estimated at 80,000 people, although
the government reports only 26,000 having been killed in the past six years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>FIS condemned the killing of innocent civilians, asserting
it has stopped its military attacks. It also announced a one-party cease-fire.
Observers believe that FIS has nothing to do with the recent massacres.
The government has accused another Islamic group called the Islamic Armed
Group (GIA) of being involved in these massacres. Some reporters say large
numbers of Algerian and foreign secret service agents penetrated GIA.  Interviewed
by several TV channels and newspapers, Algerian security officers, who fled
the country and took refuge in Europe, revealed that some of the massacres
were committed by the Algerian army and by the pro-government militia. This
accusation was confirmed by a number of international human rights groups
and by Amnesty International's Secretary General.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is one reality that no one can argue with; it is
that any Islamic group, however extremist it is, cannot accept the killing
of innocent women and children or the burning alive of any person.  These
groups might have their own claims or justifications to kill or slaughter
men or even mature women, a thing which we strongly reject, but they definitely
have no argument for killing infants and children. This is a fact known
by the common Muslims.  No, we can never believe that any Islamic group
would butcher women and children that way! We stick to the statements made
by the international human rights organizations and Amnesty International,
which all point an accusatory finger towards the government and the pro-government
militias.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why I call for legal international investigation
into the massacres committed and still being committed in Algeria. I do
not call for a military intervention, but rather for a legal team whose
only objective is to reveal the real criminals in Algeria who committed
these barbaric massacres.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why did the democratic West keep silent over the killings
in the past six years? Why did they keep silent when the army leaders butchered
democracy and removed the most popular political party in Algeria that was
about to take power in that country?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Democracy is encouraged and welcomed by Westerners as long
as it does not bring Islamists to power. What a hypocrisy!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	After more than 8 years, the United States government

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Although they won't release the details of the plan, asserting

search of their personal possessions, carry-on items and luggage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A special computer will analyze information on passengers
and identify those that need &quot;special attention&quot; at airports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Millions of dollars have been spent on devising this plan,
which advocates claim will stem the tide of airline terrorism -- the last
such act occurred on July 17, 1996 when 230 Americans were killed in the
on-flight explosion of TWA Flight 800. An exhaustive investigation of the
explosion ruled out international terrorism, a missile, and suggests it
was probably the result of a freak accident involving gaseous vapors from
fuel tanks aboard the plane.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The practice of profiling will augment technological safeguards
that already have been installed at airports, including the installation
of 54 high-tech bomb detectors and 220 trace explosive detectors. Additionally,
some 238 bomb-sniffing dogs will monitor passenger movements at US airports
by the end of this year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Still, the Federal Aviation Commission and a special US
Commission on Terrorism feels that it needs something more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why profile passengers?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Most non-Middle Eastern Americans would not be encumbered
by the profiling hassles. And, since most Middle Eastern Americans don't
vote, who cares if the burden of terrorism falls on their shoulders?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Reasoned arguments against profiling continue to fall
on deaf ears.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The most notable is the Tim McVeigh factor. You see, Tim
McVeigh is the terrorist convicted of blowing up a federal office building
in Oklahoma in April, 1996. Although the visceral reaction of the US Justice
system was to roust dozens of Arab looking passengers traveling out of Oklahoma
that day, it was an accidental encounter between an Oklahoma police officer
who pulled over McVeigh's car because it didn't have a roper license, that
resulted in McVeigh's arrest when bomb-making materials and weapons were
found in his car.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Picking on the Arab is easy, in the United States. Certainly,
it is easier than trying to disarm the hundreds of violent American militias
that operate in the American hinterlands, or stripping them of their automatic
weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And, the United States has to pick on someone, when its
policies simply fail to achieve their goal of protecting Americans from
the acts of terrorism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	You see, when government policies fail, government, by
its nature seeks out someone to blame, besides themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The easiest target in America is the Arab, who lives in
a disorganized cultural society fraught with internal political and social
divisions, and an absence of qualified leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Israelis have a word to describe the only option that
we, as Arab Americans, have in the face of this obvious form of discrimination:
It's called &quot;kvetching,&quot; or the act of whining out loud to no
one in particular.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We, Arab Americans, live in a world where it is easier
to criticize each other than it is to organize effectively and to speak
out in support of constitutional rights that have been consistently stripped
from us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	So, get ready to set aside your dignity at US Airports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It's all that we Arab Americans have left to surrender
these days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>	<B>Justice in the Eye of the Beholder</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Several major American newspapers recently carried very
expensive, full page advertisements entitled &quot;If We Forget ...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The ads reminded the world of the terrorist bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 which exploded in midair on Dec. 21, 1988, killed 259
passengers and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And, the ads, alleged, two Libyan nationals, Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali Al-Meghrahi, are responsible. It offers a $4
million reward for information on the two suspects, who were indicted by
a US court.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The United States used its power to force the United Nations
to impose an embargo against Libya, demanding that the two suspects be extradited
to England or the United States. Libya has refused, responding that the
two should be extradited to a &quot;neutral&quot; country where they have
a better than even chance of receiving a fair trial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In this case, the United States government is not really
interested in justice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Libyan refusal to surrender the two suspects to America's
kangaroo court --an American term used to describe a judicial system that
has already made up its mind against a suspect -- has given the United States
plenty of ammunition to punish Libya, which has remained a stalwart critic
of Israel and American double standards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Libya has offered to compensate the families of the victims,
but the victims have refused.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	You see, in America, the life of one American does not
have a price tag. The life of a foreigner, however, can be evaluated in
terms of dollars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Five months before Pan Am Flight 103 crashed in a fiery
explosion, gunmen on the USS Vincennes, ostensibly patrolling international
waters off the coast of Iran, fired upon Iranian Airbus A300, destroying
the commercial civilian aircraft and killing all 290 people on board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The ship's commander claimed his crew &quot;mistook&quot;
the giant commercial Boeing 747 plane for a much smaller, military F-14
fighter jet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A hastily arranged investigation by the United States,
blamed one &quot;operations officer,&quot; and issued the lowest possible
punishment, a letter of reprimand placed in the unknown officer's personnel
file. Behind-the-scenes, US Officials passed on rumors that the Airbus had
been pre-loaded with dead bodies, and intentionally sent to the war zone
believing it would be shot down to create a situation to rebuke the Americans.
(This was repeated often by family members of the victims on national TV.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	For more than four years, US officials insisted the Airbus
was at fault and had veered out of Iranian airspace into international waters,
and thereby justified the attack. Finally, in 1992, evidence surfaced that
in fact, the commercial Iranian airline had been on course and was in Iranian
airspace. It was the USS Vincennes that had been of course by more than
20 miles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Additional evidence showed that the commander of the American
cruiser, Capt.Will C. Rogers III, may have intentionally shot the commercial
airline down, and that he was egging for such a military hit. The Vincennes
had been called into the waters near Iran as a result of the Iran-Iraq war
and they claimed tiny little Iranian gunboats had fired upon the massive
US cruiser.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In all the bluster from then President Ronald Reagan,
he never once expressed remorse for the murder of the 290 Muslim civilians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The United States has never publicly apologized for the
downing of the commercial plan, and have resisted all efforts by the Iranians
to investigate Capt. Rogers and his crew.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, the United States was quick to offer monetary
compensation to the families of the 290 victims. More than $131 million
was paid to sweep the controversy under the rug.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Iranian protests to the United Nations were muted by allies
of the United States government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	No UN embargo was imposed on the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	No full page advertisements were purchased calling for
the extradition of that American buckaroo, Will C. Rogers. All evidence
suggests he knew it was a commercial Iranian airline, but wanted to bring
it down anyway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The families of the victims of Airbus A300 did not form
a special organization to hire lawyers to exact a punishment from the Americans.
They weren't given a forum on national American TV, as were family members
of the Pan Am 103 disaster.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And, no court marshall was held to indict Will C. Rogers
for a crime that he and the US Navy struggled to cover up these past 10
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Maybe the victims of Pan Am 103 downed off of Lockerbie,
Scotland do deserve justice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But do they deserve any more justice than the victims
of Iranian Airbus A300?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Clinton And The Peace Process.. History Does
Repeat Itself</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By David McLau</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Right when Clinton was finally
in a position this week to put</FONT></I></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>pressure on Israel to give back the
land it stole from</FONT></I></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians, look what happened!&quot;</FONT></I></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><I>&quot; There is no chance that Clinton
will put the pressure on now. The most pro Israel President in history needs
all of his Zionist supporters just to get him out of this mess.&quot;</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course, President Eisenhower didn't hesitate to put
pressure on Israel, and it's partners France and Great Britain, to get them
out of the Suez after their invasion of Egypt in late 1956.  Eisenhower
wasn't afraid, and he did put the pressure on without a worry of retaliation
from the weak Israeli lobby back then.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But, Eisenhower was the last U.S. President to stand up
to the lobby. During that crisis, President Ike had threatened to cut off
all tax exemption for the millions of needed donations to Israel from U.S.
citizens. Israel was out of the Suez lickety-split, within days, in early
1957.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before that there was President Truman, with the desperation
of re-election and at Clark Clifford's advice, but against George Marshall's
advice, who had struck a bargain and recognized Israel's statehood in 1948.
But this was more of a mutual benefit deal for both Israel and Truman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the days of Eisenhower, the Israeli lobby has gotten
a lot smarter and a lot stronger, and they have tried to control U.S. Presidents
any way they could.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1973, just when President Nixon, being immune from the
lobby in his second term, was in a position to put pressure on Israel, what
do we get? Watergate!  And with the pro-Israel Washington Post leading the
way. Nixon's second term essentially never happened. Another Mideast war
followed as a result as the Arabs tried to get back their land in October
of that year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just when President Carter was starting to put pressure
on Israel's Prime Minister Begin to stop the settlements in 1980 and proceed
with the second part of Camp David, which specified peace with Israel's
other neighbours, what do we get? We get the &quot;bad press treatment&quot;
from Israel's Zionist supporters, such as ABC's Nightline, with Ted Kopple
and Barbara Walters, night after night; the Iran hostage situation, for
one entire year. Meanwhile, Israel made sure that there would be no October
surprise release of the hostages that might swing the election back to Carter,
who would be sure to put more pressure on Israel in his second term. But,
of course, the second term never happened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just when President Bush, in a possible second term, might
have been in a position to again put pressure on Israel, what do we get
in 1992? Well, how is this for starters?  William Safire, New York Times
writer, who leads Israel's &quot;Amen corner&quot; in our country, all of
a sudden becomes a Bill Clinton supporter. That's right!  Never mind that
Mr. Safire is a life-long conservative Republican and former speech writer
for President Nixon.  Now he likes that liberal Clinton!  And Clinton wins
in 1992. No second term for that anti-Israel Bush!  And thus, no pressure
on Israel!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And then one month after the 1992 election, what do we
get from Mr. Safire?  Well, that was the start of Mr. Safire's incessant
two-year Whitewater expos&eacute;, whereby for a period of two years, Mr.
Safire wrote about nothing else except Whitewater!  Every day!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I thought he liked Bill Clinton!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And where was Safire getting all of his inside info during
that time? Some say it was from none other than Vincent Foster, the White
House insider, who, when confronted by Hillary Clinton with the leaks appearing
in Safire's columns, later committed suicide. But, we don't know that for
sure about Mr. Foster, other than the record and writings of Mr. Safire,
which couldn't be disputed during that time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What better way to control a President than to keep him
weak under constant threat of some scandal?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And now look what we have with Bill Clinton this week,
right when he was finally in a position to put pressure on Israel to give
back the land it stole from Palestinians? It's another scandal that will
tie the President's hands.  Does this explain why he was so friendly with
Mr. Netanyahu when the two met this week and Israel was supposed to come
up with an exact amount of land to give back, but defied the U.S. once more?
I thought there was supposed to be a big showdown with Netanyahu!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is no chance that Clinton will put the pressure on
now. He needs all of his Zionist supporters just to get him out of this
mess, just like they did back in 1992 with the Jennifer Flowers scandal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some would say that Clinton was not going to put the pressure
on Israel anyway. But, at least he was free and in position to do so. And
one must remember that he has resisted Israel's call to proceed directly
to the final status talks. Now, all bets are off.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clinton had advance knowledge of the breaking scandal as
early as last Friday (16 January). It was Newsweek magazine that was about
to break the story, but held back only to allow Mr. Star, the special prosecutor,
more time to possibly entrap Vernon Jordon and the President with another
wire, as Mr. Star already did to Ms. Lewinsky. I personally no longer will
be buying Newsweek Magazine! Newsweek Magazine is also owned by the Washington
Post.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Had they got to Mr. Jordon, they would have the President
for certain, and we would have Al Gore, who is a creation of the Israeli
lobby, as our new President. We would have at least another three more years
of suffering for the Palestinians, with the Israeli lobby totally in control
of our President, and probably another war over there too. And then it would
be Mr. Gore's turn to seek re-election.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If Clinton can survive this, and I think and hope that
he will, there will be a big backlash against all of this intrusion into
the President's private life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I am already tired of hearing about this story. And if
he does survive, I hope he takes the opportunity to get rid of his Zionist
advisers so we can get some justice for Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Interview with the Leader of the Islamic Action Front
in Jordan</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Dr. Arabiyat: We boycotted elections for
honest participation</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Pluralism, women and economy&shy;IAF's top
priorities</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman- Interviewed by Mahmoud al Khatib - </FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Abdel Latif Arabiyat, the newly elected Secretary-General
of the Islamic Action Front Party (IAF) in Jordan, said his party will address
political pluralism, and the situations of women and the economy. He pointed
out that his party boycotted the last parliamentary elections because it
sought a clean and honest election.  Following is the interview with Dr.
Arabiyat after he was elected as the new Secretary-General succeeding Dr.
Isaaq Al Farhan:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. It is said that a certain group in the Party dominated
the results of the internal Shura elections. What is your assessment?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The results of the elections
went in the general direction of the IAF's policies. The Party is leading
the Opposition parties in Jordan. It is the largest party in the country
and contains members of different qualifications and cultural levels. Therefore,
it is natural to have different and various opinions and views within the
Party. The members who ran for the elections of the Shura Council were competing
against each other over goodness and creativity. Our Arab societies are
not yet accustomed to the Islamic Shura concept, which allows pluralism,
creation and mutual competition. They understand it as a kind of dispute
or split. Whatever the opinions in the Party are, there is one authority,
the Shura principle, by which all members should abide. We should get ourselves
used to hearing the other views and co-exist with pluralism. Unfortunately,
the media classified owners of these different views into moderates and
extremists. We, the Muslims, find these classifications strange and not
accepted. Islam established the rules for freedom of expression and competition
for goodness. We need restrictions for the political Fiqh and a system of
Islamic consultations to control the conduct of the Islamic establishments.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How did the IAF deal with the various views concerning
the decision to boycott elections?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The decision to boycott
the elections was the most serious one made by the IAF. Some members resigned
in protest against the decision, but they came back after they referred
to the real authority, Shura. The internal front of the Party is united.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. It is said that the IAF has two authorities: the
Muslim Brotherhood on one hand and the IAF's Shura Council on the other.
Don't you think this is dangerous?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The Islamic Movement is
one. Islam is one everywhere, and it is against division or splits. We believe
in one God, one Holy Book. The prophets and messengers came with one message.
We are one Islamic Movement and therefore there is no difference between
the Muslim Brotherhood and the IAF or any other Islamic movement. The Muslim
Brotherhood has their own Shura council. They studied the parliamentary
elections and decided to boycott them.  IAF also has its independent Shura
council, which decided also to boycott the elections. This does not mean
that one body is dominating the other. The majority in the two councils
decided to boycott the elections.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What is your programme in the light of the current
situations?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The most important aspects
issued in our agenda are political pluralism, and the situations of women
and the economy. We should use Islamic solutions for the contemporary issues
that face the nation. New concepts have been created that should be addressed
such as globalization, the civil society and privatization. Islam can deal
with these concepts more than any other ideology. Women should be prepared
for participation in political life.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. After you boycotted the elections, how will you deal
with the newly elected parliament concerning the draft laws the government
has submitted concerning parties, professional associations, etc.?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> We don't have a problem
with the new parliament. We are ready to cooperate with it. We only had
objections against the &quot;One Man One Vote&quot; law and against some
procedures in the electoral process.  The draft law of parties is one of
a host of the so-called freedom laws that were submitted in 1992 when I
was the Speaker of the Jordanian Parliament. The government is now revising
the 1992 law of parties, but we still don't know what amendments the government
wants to make in the law. The government also wants to amend the law of
the professional associations because they are involved in politics and
because of their Islamic affiliation. If the amendments were made, the government
would harm the achievements of these associations and injure their morale.
We want to push the laws forward and preserve the present democratic achievements.
We don't want to go backwards.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jordan: &quot;Normalizing&quot; MPs face
angry crowds</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;The news struck us like thunder; the thought of
it just makes my stomach turn&quot;, said Mahmoud Abu Osbah, headmaster
at a school in Al Baqa'a Refugee Camp.  Dr. Nabeel Attursh said he was shocked
when he heard the news, while Sheikh Azmi Al Jawabreh described it as &quot;disappointing
and confusing news.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Those angry, yet sad, reactions came in response to the
visit to Israel by Sheikh Mohammed Ra'fat and Mr. Hammadeh Fra'aneh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Mr. Khalid Arar, the campaign manager of Sheikh Ra'fat,
said he was sorry for all those who gave their votes to Ra'fat, and asked
them to boycott him as a step to discrediting his representation of Al Baqa'a
Refugee Camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On the other hand, there was a wide public campaign in
the Palestinian camps to collect over 20,000 signatures for a petition declaring
a protest and outright disapproval of the acts committed by the two MPs
with a request for their respective resignations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The widespread discontent and condemnation of the visit
to Israel by the two Jordanian Parliament deputies, wherein they met with
the Israeli Knesset speaker and Shas leader, came as a loud and clear sign
to both of them and whoever plans to follow in their footsteps that the
public fully rejects and opposes any act of normalization.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	As for the official reaction to such a surprising visit,
the speaker of the Lower House, Eng. Sa'ad Hayel Al Srour, said in his comment
that the visit of the two MPs was on a personal basis and that they were
not delegates of the Jordanian Parliament.  However, he made sure that no
action would be taken against them by blocking the attempt by some opposition
deputies wanting to call for an investigation so as to question the two
MPs and determine what measures should be taken regarding their case.  Of
course, the fact that the two deputies were let go with no accountability
came as a disappointment to the angry public.  This incident just strengthened
the likelihood that the new Parliament is nothing more than a fa&ccedil;ade,
that it has no real power of its own or that it is in any way independent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The visit to Israel by the two Jordanian MPs drew so much
resentment for many reasons, especially towards Sheikh Ra'fat since Mr.
Fra'aneh was known for his normalization views long before he became a deputy.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	First, there was the timing of the visit.  It came at
a time when the peace process was at a standstill, when the Israeli Prime
Minister considered any withdrawal beyond 6% of Palestinian land as an act
of &quot;suicide&quot; that he's &quot;not willing to commit for anybody&quot;,
and when the colonial settlement policy of the Israeli government was in
full swing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Secondly, their level of representation, which could be
considered both official and public, is such that their positions hold some
weight in the political arena.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Thirdly, both Sheikh Ra'fat and Mr. Fra'aneh are representatives,
in a sense, of the two largest Palestinian camps in Amman.  Sheikh Ra'fat
took the second highest number of votes in the Kingdom.  He is a member
of the right-wing Islamic group Al Salafi.  So not only was he representing
the camps, but he was also considered to be representing the views of the
Islamists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Bearing in mind all these factors, one would surely come
to the conclusion that the visit was foolish and improper.  It should also
be realized that such a visit could be considered a gesture of approval
or even some sort of reward to the Israeli government at a time when everyone
is criticizing Israel's performance regarding the peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Jordanian people are determined to keep the peace
with Israel on ice, always acting vigorously and vigilantly to thwart any
trend of normalization.  One thing is for sure&shy;the two deputies can
safely bet that they will not be elected for a second term unless they show
true repentance.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Invoking past horrors to justify present
crimes</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Dr. Daud A. Abdullah*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was Christmas day 1977.  Egypt's President Anwar Sadat
was hosting the Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at a special luncheon
in the Suez resort city of  Ismailiya. The former leader of one of the world's
most ruthless terrorist organizations, Irgun Zvai Leumi,  took the opportunity
to lecture his host on the history of Jewish persecution from Roman times
until the holocaust. After his impassioned invocation of past memories,
the Israeli leader unrepentantly reaffirmed his country's refusal to grant
sovereignty to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By a strange
turn of history, the 'unfinished business' of Jewish suffering and Palestinian
rights have resurfaced twenty years later to dominate the political agenda
of the international community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 2 December 1997 the London Conference on Nazi Gold opened
in Lancaster House. Delegates from 40 countries, six organizations representing
the survivors, and four organizations responsible for handling the Nazi
gold came together in the stately building where many former colonies had
tediously negotiated their independence from Britain. The burning issue
on this occasion was not independence; for Israel had long fought and won
its 'war of independence' in 1948. Neither was it the independence of Palestine,
even though its sovereignty was recognized by the League of Nations in 1922
and remained suspended ever since. The purpose of the London Conference
was according to its convenor, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, to talk about
the Nazi gold - whom it came from, what the Nazis did with it, and what
happened to it after the war.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In an effort  'to clarify one of the darkest episodes in
human history'  Mr. Cook took the opportunity to announce a donation of
&uacute;1million to a new international fund for Jewish victims of the holocaust.
 America the co-sponsor of the fund pledged $25 million over the next three
years.  And, although Switzerland had under the 1946 Washington Accord handed
back $58 million to the Allies, it found itself facing a new demand from
the World Jewish Congress for an additional &uacute;1.5 billion in gold.
 Despite its enormity, this largesse of compensation will not, however,
'erase the sadness and loss' of the Jews.  For as  the Foreign Secretary
explained, their suffering was one 'that can never be expiated.'  At the
end of the three day gathering, world Jewry, it seems, had succeeded in
killing two birds with one stone. For not only did they come away with a
handsome package of compensation, but moreover, they had managed to keep
alive the memory of the evil crimes committed by the Nazis.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course, by keeping  alive the memory of 1939-45, world
Jewry has inadvertently drawn international attention not only to their
suffering but also their own accomplicity in similar crimes against humanity.
 While the modern political pragmatists may, understandably, feign ignorance
of ancient Jewish villainies, it would seem inexcusable that in the age
of 'ethical' diplomacy they should forget the injustices meted out against
the Palestinian people. How can they forget the 1947 partition of Palestine?;
the seminal act which precipitated the Palestinian catastrophe. The evidence
is overwhelmingly damning. It records that in 1947 the Jewish population
in Palestine numbered 650,000. The relative increase of their proportion
of the population which rose from 12.9% in 1922 to 33% in 1947 was primarily
due to a policy of mass immigration facilitated by the British Mandatory.
Though constituting a mere one-third of the population, the United Nations
through resolution 181, granted them 56.4% of Palestine. This regrettable
act of inequity which was sanctioned by the civilized nations has resulted
in a human catastrophe whose tragic destruction has continued until today.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian losses  </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For the Palestinians, the issue is not simply one of compensation,
important though it be. It is, first and foremost, a question of land, freedom,
and independence. Having obtained the backing of the United Nations in 1947,
the Zionists moved immediately to extend their control over Palestine. 
At the rate of more than one a day, they in 1948, obliterated 385 Palestinian
villages even with their cemeteries and tombstones. Through a systematic
campaign of murder, mayhem, and expulsion the gun-toting Zionist immigrants
transformed the Palestinian majority population into a minority community
in the very land where they had lived continuously and uninterrupted for
thousands of years. During the period 1947-49, they increased by force the
size of the territory granted to them by the UN partition plan from 5,900
square miles to about 7,800 square miles (77.4 percent).  Several years
later, the scale of the crime was poignantly described by Moshe Dayan the
former Israeli Minister of Defence.  While addressing students at the Haifa
Technion School in March 1969 he admitted that; 'There is not a single Jewish
village in this country that has not been built upon the site of an Arab
village.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the whole, Palestinian losses were enormous as well
as far-reaching. They extended from houses, farms, schools and, mosques
to jewelry, antiques, animals, industrial assets, agricultural capital,
and bank deposits.  More than a quarter of the buildings in use in Israel
were originally the property of Palestinians. Today, many of their owners
still live in squalid refugee camps holding the keys and deeds to their
stolen property.  In the same manner, about 90% of Israel's olive groves
and 50% of its citrus orchards were taken from their Arab owners. The value
of these olive groves and citrus orchards were so huge that the income which
they generated were used to alleviate the acute balance-of-payments problem
which Israel suffered from between 1948 and 1953. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In strict financial terms, Palestinian losses were meticulously
assessed and documented by internationally acclaimed scholars like Walid
Khalidi, Sami Hadawi, and Salman Abu Sitta. In his pioneering study, Hadawi
evaluated overall Palestinian losses to be about &uacute;743 million in
1948. Using the same criteria adopted by the Germans to compensate the Jews,
a recent study by Salman Abu Sitta  fixed the total Palestinian losses including
that for human suffering at $485 billion in 1995.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Zionism and Nazism   </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Obviously the glorification of violence was by no means
peculiar to the Nazis. The history of Zionism is similarly replete with
examples of terrorist crimes and mass murder not only of Palestinians but
other peoples as well. Following the assassination of Lord Moyne the British
Minister of State in Cairo on 4 November 1944, Prime Minister Churchill
condemned the Zionist Stern Gang after two of its members confessed to the
killing. He told the Commons on 17 November that 'If our dreams of Zionism
are to end in the smoke of assassins' guns and our labors for its future
to produce only a new set of gangsters worthy of Nazi Germany, then many
like myself will have to reconsider the position we have maintained so consistently
and so long in the past.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Michael Adams the veteran British journalist and former
Director of the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding
(Caabu) made a similar comparison between Jewish excesses and Nazism. Writing
in The Guardian on 26 January 1968 he noted: &quot;I had my ups and downs
during four years as a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany but the Germans never
treated me as harshly as the Israelis are treating the Arabs of the Gaza
Strip, the majority of whom are women and children.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the immediate post war years, very little was known
about the Zionist movement and its connection with Nazism.  With the gradual
opening up of governmental archives across Europe, researchers later gained
a better insight into this relationship. Several recent works have since
exposed the intense cooperation that existed between the Zionist leadership
and the Nazis not only in Germany but in other places which came under Nazi
influence. One of the main problems which seriously threatened the success
of the colonial project in Palestine was, significantly, the unwillingness
of European Jews to emigrate. In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, the
representative of the German Intelligence Agency in Jerusalem, Dr. Franz
Reichert, organized a visit for the head of the Haganah intelligence, Feivel
Polkes, to Berlin between 26 February and 2 March 1937. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While in Berlin, Polkes held a series of meetings with
senior Gestapo officials led by Adolf Eichman. From the onset Polkes emphasized
that his aim was to secure the mass emigration of Jews into Palestine. As
is always the case in circumstances of this kind, there had to be a trade
off. Thus according to the II/112 memorandum of 17 June 1937 Polkes '...declared
himself ready to gather information for Germany that did not conflict with
his own political ends. Among other things he would vigorously support German
foreign policy interests in the Middle East and use his influence to secure
sources of oil for the German Reich that would not touch upon British spheres
of influence if German currency regulations for Jews emigrating to Palestine
would be relaxed.'2  It is believed that Israel's subsequent kidnap and
execution of Eichman was provoked by the wealth of information which he
possessed concerning Nazi-Zionist cooperation and the massacre of Jews in
Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Summary</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The extended honeymoon between Zionism and western geo-political
interests has, for the past 50 years, obstructed every attempt to secure
a just settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  For although the destiny
of the Palestinian people constitutes the core of the conflict and its solution,
the world has continued to disregard their national existence and sovereign
rights. Indeed, the failure of the international community to acknowledge
that a horrendous injustice was done to the Palestinians has itself been
a primary cause for the prevailing sense of betrayal, anger and resentment
among Arabs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That world Jewry should today invoke the memories of Nazi
atrocities is not entirely surprising. Consequently, the current hue and
cry over the Jewish holocaust must be seen as the enactment of an orchestrated
plan intended to keep public opinion imprisoned in the Nazi era and cover-up
Zionist crimes. That the world should, however, ignore Zionist crimes is
indeed mind-boggling. Their destruction of Palestinian homes, villages,
and seizure of land has continued unabated since 1947.  Yet, Palestinian
attempts to draw attention to their on-going genocide are often disregarded.
It was precisely for this reason the eminent British philosopher Bertrand
Russel wrote shortly before his death in 1970; 'We are frequently told that
we must sympathize with Israel because of the sufferings of the Jews in
Europe at the hands of the Nazis.... What Israel is doing today cannot be
condoned, and to invoke the horror of the past to justify those of the present
is gross hypocrisy.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On their part, Palestinians maintain that all the efforts
at brokering a settlement have failed because they were founded on the wrong
premises. While few mediation efforts have insisted on justice, the vast
majority have sought to find a practical solution. They have consequently
failed because practical solutions are not necessarily just solutions. The
cornerstone of an acceptable settlement cannot, therefore, be short of an
independent and sovereign Palestinian state.  Any attempt to create an entity
less than a state, sprinkled with 'armed archeologists' under alien supervision
will not be a substitute for nationhood. Hence, Zionist attempts to exploit
indefinitely the holocaust should neither be perceived nor condoned as a
means to deny the Palestinians' right to their land, peace, justice, and
security. Now that the London Conference on Nazi gold has ended, the least
its convenors can do in the interest of global peace is to insist that Israel
itself makes immediate reparations from the very gold for the destruction
of Palestine and the suffering which it has inflicted upon its people over
the past 50 years.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Politics of Islamophobia</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Yaqub Zaki</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>(3- 3)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Someone once said that Muhammad (SAW) formulated the only
challenge Christianity has had to face in its history.  For 1,400 years
Islam and Christianity have confronted each other from opposite sides of
the Mediterranean as alternative and mutually antagonistic systems. The
historical roots of the conflict explain why the antagonism between Christianity
and Islam is deeper than the antagonism between Christianity and Hinduism
or between Christianity and Buddhism. Any religion predicated on a linear
view of history presumes its own finality.  Therefore it is na&iuml;ve of
Muslims to express astonishment at Christians' failure to see Islam other
than as a false religion:  Christianity can no more accept Islam than Islam
can accept Baha'ism or Qadiyanism; we cannot blame Christians for doing
what we do ourselves.  Christianity cannot accept a post-Christian revelation
without negating itself. This is, however, what Christians expected of Jews
for 2,000 years until the economic and political power of the Jews led the
churches to call off the campaign for their conversion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To the medieval mind, the success of a post-Christian,
consequently false, revelation could only be the work of the Devil: Muhammad
was the anti-Christ, the Qur'an a Satanic fabrication.  Only two hypotheses
could account for Islam's success:  either the Prophet was an emissary the
Devil had placed on earth to frustrate God's purpose or he was a charlatan,
an impostor.  These two views alternate throughout history. From the 7th
to the 18th century forward, Islam was considered the work of the Devil;
from the 18th century, Islam was viewed as an imposture.  Since, post-Enlightenment,
a metaphysical explanation was no longer tenable, the Prophet became a secular
devil.  Rushdie's view neatly fits the secular paradigm of history:  &quot;...
the closer you are to the conjurer,&quot; he says, &quot;the easier it is
to spot the trick&quot; (referring to his own Muslim origins). Thus, The
Satanic Verses, which has done so much to feed Islamophobic sentiment in
our day, is 18th century in its approach, exemplified by Voltaire's famous
play of 1742, Fanatisme ou Mahomet le Proph&egrave;te.  The 19th century
saw an unholy alliance forged between the secularists and the missionaries.
The missionaries, whose objective was to discredit Islam using whatever
tools at hand, espoused the secular hypothesis and denounced the Prophet
as an impostor.  Voltaire's letter to Frederick the Great epitomizes the
viewpoint of the Enlightenment: &quot;That a camel merchant should excite
a revolt in his townlet; that, associated with some wretched Quraishites,
he should persuade them that he holds converse with the angel Gabriel; that
he should boast of being rapt to Heaven, and of having received there part
of this unintelligible book which affronts common sense at every page; that
he should put his own country to fire and sword to make this book respected;
that he should cut the fathers' throats and ravish their daughters; that
he should give the vanquished the choice between his religion and death;
this certainly is what no man can excuse.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Church was too powerful for Voltaire to attack; it
was safer to attack religion under the guise of Islam.  The man who saw
through this tactic was that great tactician Napoleon. Napoleon said:  &quot;He
attacks Jesus Christ in Mahomet&quot;.  The crucial phrase in Voltaire's
letter is &quot;this unintelligible book which affronts common sense at
every page&quot;.  Ignoring that this is coded language for the Bible, the
missionary view coincides with that of secular agnostics such as Patricia
Crowe and Michael Cook, whose phraseology in their book Hagarism echoes
Voltaire:  the Qur'an is &quot;rather opaque&quot;, &quot;lacking in structure&quot;,
&quot;obscure&quot;, &quot;inconsequential&quot;, &quot;disparate&quot;,
and &quot;repetitious&quot;.  Secular humanists and missionaries employ
identically the same terminology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is an explanation for this paradox. Muir, Margoliouth,
Rodwell, Lammens: it is no accident that the writers most hostile to Islam
belonged to countries with colonies in Muslim lands.  There is therefore
a convergence between missionaries and secularists, producing what we can
call anti-Islamic syndrome. This convergence was epitomized in the person
of Gladstone, Evangelical Christian and imperialist;  in fact, Britain may
be said to have declared war on Islam the day Gladstone held up the Qur'an
in the House of Commons and said, &quot;So long as the Muslims have this
book, we shall never be able to defeat them.&quot;  Gladstone thundered
against the Turks with their &quot;abominable and bestial lusts&quot;. 
The Turks, he said, &quot;were guilty of such unspeakable crimes that Hell
itself might almost blush.&quot; The liberation of the Serbs and the Bulgarians
was, he said, a just and honourable cause, anticipating thereby the fatwa
of the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1990 declaring the Gulf War to be a just
war.  Gladstone's remarks were uttered in the context of the Eastern Question,
1876 - 1889. (Serbia has been Britain's ally in the Balkans since that time;
John Major is in the straight line of descent from Gladstone.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A pamphlet published by the Bosnian Muslim Intellectual
Forum in Sarajevo accounts for the recent growth of Islamophobia in these
terms: &quot;Depending on the intensity of Christian-Islamic conflicts,
this revulsion [toward Islam] inevitably developed into a recognizable anti-Islamic
syndrome.  ... Anti-Islamic syndrome has not been consigned to history.
 It is still alive and growing today. but often in different forms and under
different names. Being susceptible to transportation, it is transferred&shy;mutatis
mutandis&shy;to many other areas where the followers of Islam are living,
including, of course, Bosnia-Hercegovina. After the collapse of the Soviet
Empire, which was 'the evil empire' for the West, it intensified.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In essentially different forms, there appeared the
Green Threat, especially after the Khomeini Revolution in Iran, transferring
its striking power to another Islamic environment with substantial social
difference.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This report identifies only two out of three factors: 
it sees the proximate cause of the current rise in Islamophobia as the revolution
in Iran, which decisively changed the balance of the Middle Eastern power
equation, and the collapse of communism, which left the whole military-industrial
complex of the West bereft of a visible target.  Islam, the former Cold
War partner, moved overnight from ally to enemy. Kilroy-Silk said that Muslims
are &quot;backward and evil, and if it is racist to say so then racist I
must be and happy and proud to be so.&quot;  A third factor, overlooked
by the Sarajevo conference, is international zionism: the late unlamented
Rabin never made a speech without once referring to the Islamic Peril, thereby
raising the same atavistic fears in the Western psyche that the Yellow Peril
raised 100 years ago. Virtually identical language is in fact used by Islamophobes:
 newspapers in speaking of a FIS victory in Algeria raise the spectre of
a Europe inundated by hordes of North Africans, a peril all the more real
for being 6,000 miles closer than the fictitious Yellow one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We repeat what we said earlier that the Prophet formulated
the only challenge Christianity has had to face in its 2,000 years of otherwise
successful history. But it is not only that:  Islam came to found a civilization.
Islamic civilization, based as it is on universally valid predicates, is
perhaps the sole valid alternative today to Western civilization. The intellectual
underpinning of modern Western civilization is liberalism. The origins of
liberalism lie not only in the Enlightenment but in laissez-faire capitalism,
Manchester economics and Darwinism. It relies on an anthropology. According
to this anthropology, human nature is not fallen, it is basically good;
man, therefore, if left to his own devices, will naturally opt for what
is good both for himself and others. This is why liberals cherish such pathological
hatred for Islam. Liberalism encourages freedom without responsibility.
Absolute freedom does not exist because our rights are limited by the rights
of others.  An is the freedom of speech. The Labour Party proclaims its
belief in freedom of speech, particularly Rushdie's freedom to insult Islam,
but wants to pass a law making it an offence to question the Holocaust.
 This is precisely the difference between Islam and the values of the West.
The jungle is free: civilization is not.  Those who want the freedom of
the jungle must, like Rushdie, be prepared to accept the retribution of
the jungle. Islam is diametrically opposed to liberalism because it posits
the existence of absolutes. The alternative to belief in absolutes is moral
relativism, which leads to anarchy. Islamic civilization is the opposite
of anarchy: it is order, obedience, discipline and equilibrium; the Islamic
ideal of the state is one that enables the individual to attain the highest
degree of taqwa so as to earn the ridwan of Allah.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islam infuriates the liberals by its refusal to lie down
and die; it challenges the presumptions on which Western superiority rests
by its mere survival.  This drives the liberals to fury, polarizes their
predictable reaction and provokes them to ever more hysterical pronouncements.
The hysteria discloses an atavism they would be the first to repudiate,
but it is there.  It reveals depths of fear and insecurity that one might
never otherwise have suspected, with horsetails waving again before the
gates of Vienna.  One example of such hysteria is Peregrine Worthsthorne,
another Kilroy-Silk.  To paraphrase the latter: Western liberals are evil
and decadent and if it be racist to say so then I am proud and happy to
be so.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Targeting Egypt via Sudan: Albright's African
Tour</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Munir Shafeeq*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright's bold statements, following her meeting with
Jon Garang and four members of his entourage at the helm of the movement
to secede from the Sudanese south, pulled aside the fake cloak with which
the U.S. Administration sheaths its policies in the region of the African
Great Lakes towards rebellion in southern Sudan, and in the way of inciting
neighbouring States to wage war against the State of Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright exposed everything this time&shy;her cards as
well as those of many regional co-conspirators hell-bent with the U.S. Administration
and the Mossad upon breaking up Sudan, controlling the lifeline of the Nile,
and setting up a pro-Western puppet regime in the capital Khartoum.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unashamedly, Albright voiced support for the separatist
rebellion in southern Sudan while calling out to the Sudanese opposition
to pull its ranks together&shy;behind the Zionist and U.S. strategy, of
course&shy;to launch a military offensive and to resort to all available
means to clinch power in Khartoum. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That is, of course, an overt interference in Sudan's internal
affairs, a blunt call to resort to violence and terrorism, and an indisputable
effort to divide up the sovereign State of Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But these policies and practices sharply contradict the
principles of international law and the codes of international relations.
 Yet their active adoption by the U.S. Government leaves no room for any
doubt that the justifications it furnished for its pro-Zionist Mideast policies,
especially those ostensibly based on protecting human rights, defending
international legitimacy, or stopping Mideast violence, are nothing but
a fine collection of quintessential lies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Here the question arises as to the particular timing Albright
chose to drop the fig leaf instead of going on with the traditional game
of conducting U.S. policy from behind ornate charades.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly enough, Albright's tour occurred right after
the Government in Khartoum almost concluded a peace deal with Jon Garang,
which she had already thwarted while in the final phases.  More important,
however, her tour came on the heels of a drastic improvement in Egyptian-Sudanese
relations and the Sudanese Government's calls for a major and effective
Egyptian role in the mediation to resolve the south Sudanese problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This means that the nervous and outlandish moves Albright
ventured in her African tour may have been directed at Egyptian-Sudanese
relations.  More to the point, they targeted Egypt and its Arab, Sudanese
and African roles as much as they targeted Sudan and its regime, territorial
integrity, identity and future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Predictably, U.S.-Israeli strategy has always moved to
isolate Sudan from Egypt, wreaking havoc between the two Arab and Islamic
neighbouring States whenever possible.  The same strategy consistently sought
to tear Sudan into pieces and to place a client regime in Khartoum to complete
the process of suffocating and besieging Egypt as the cornerstone of the
colonial strategy to implode and subdue the whole Arab landscape to total
U.S.-Israeli control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Degrading Sudan thus becomes the natural complement to
the military siege from the side of the Gulf, the Turkish-Israeli pact from
the side of the Syrian north, in addition to the military presence borne
out by the Jewish State in Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the Western front, the Spanish Al Mondo revealed in
December a secret document in which the U.S.-led NATO alliance endorsed
the formation of a force of 50,000 strong, to be headquartered in Spain,
for speedy military intervention in the Western States of the Arab Maghreb,
namely Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even after all the foregoing, we still manage to find some
Arabs among us whose feelings actually get hurt upon hearing any criticism
of the U.S. Government!! </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Turkey: a despotic banana republic</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The recent decision by the so-called Constitutional Court
in Turkey to dissolve the moderate Islamist party, the Refah, was outrageous
as it was expected. The draconian decision reminds everybody, particularly
the European Union, that Turkey is still, as it has always been since Kemal
Attaturk terminated the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, a military despotism
disguised as a &quot;democracy.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This time, however, the transparent disguise, actually
merely a thin fig leaf, has been removed, exposing a military junta bent
on suppressing the will of the Turkish Muslim people whenever its arrogated
privileges are questioned let alone challenged.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Constitutional Court, a mouthpiece of the anti-Islam
and anti-democracy military establishment, sought to justify the dissolution
of Refah on the grounds that the peaceful-minded party held ideas and principles
incompatible with the &quot;republican principles of Attaturk.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is a corrupt excuse, to put it mildly, for if the
Turks were to stick with the highly authoritarian and fascist-like teachings
of Attaturk, they would be doomed for ages to despotism, given the fact
that democracy is never a part of Attaturk's principles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the contemporary history of Turkey is fraught with
examples of military intervention in the democratic process. The tragic
ousting from power and execution of Prime Minister Adnan Mandaris in 1951,
the military coup in 1980, and the recent dissolution of a political party
which only three months ago was at the helm of the regime, speaks volumes
about Turkish &quot;democracy.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To give the decision a legal dressing, the court cited
two anecdotal incidents that it claimed proved that Refah leader Necmeddin
Arbakan violated the secular tenets of the republic (ostensibly the official
religion of the military establishment).  First, a reception hosted by Arbakan
at the Premier's Office to which Muslim religious leaders were invited and,
second, a call by Arbakan on his supporters to financially support an Islamist-oriented
TV station. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The petty &quot;offenses&quot; cited by the court actually
invite derision and revulsion. By clinging to such trivialities, the Old
Turks, e.g. army generals, would have us believe that the governments of
Western Europe and the United States are all &quot;anti-secular&quot; and
therefore &quot;a threat to true democracy&quot; because they happen to
have amicable coexistence, rather than confrontation, with religion.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the out-of-date followers of Attaturk, seemingly
the last staunch guardians of anti-religious secularism in the world, should
think twice before continuing to beg for EU membership lest their &quot;pure
secularism&quot; be contaminated or made impure by the rudimentary religious
aspects of Christian Western Europe.  After all, some important European
countries are governed by religious democrats, which could blemish Attaturk's
legacy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Far from undermining the Islamist phenomenon in Turkey,
the Constitutional Court decision reflects the insecurity felt by the military
establishment.  Some say that Turkey is experiencing an identity crisis
after 70 years of unidimensional authoritarian republicanism.  Indeed, that
crisis is likely to continue and even deepen in scope because the Muslim
people of Turkey will not just play deaf and dumb in the face of the new
sinister Kemalist-Zionist conspiracy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Turkey's hopes of &quot;going European&quot;
will consequently suffer irreversible damage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Europe just can't grant EU membership to a country where
the political and judicial authorities are subservient and not effectively
controlled by the military. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, the dissolution of Refah would undoubtedly
herald a period of political instability in that important country.  In
fact, the Islamists could eventually stand to gain, being projected as the
only popular and ideological power contesting the erstwhile-uncontested
hegemony of the military establishment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In any case, the &quot;battle for Turkey&quot; is far from
over.  In fact, it has just begun.</FONT></P>

or even thousands of Jewish children would stop the Crusade of Zionism should
remember Ben-Gurion's words.  Sure, the parents of dead children feel that
stealing a nation is not worth such a price.  But within a week of each
suicide bombing, the rest of Israel counts the dead as the cost of doing
business.  And when business is good, those costs are followed by profits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In this case, the pay-off is sympathy from parents around
the world&shy;sympathy which Israel can spend like cash to cover the public
relations cost of killing more Palestinians, destroying more Palestinian
homes, stealing more Palestinian land and expanding Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  How many Palestinians can they
kill in exchange for one picture of one lifeless Israeli child on the front
page of the New York Times: 10, 50, 100?  This is a very poor exchange rate
for Palestinians, and it is very bad business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Imagine, instead, a front-page picture of a blown up bridge,
the inside of a burnt-out university computer centre, a toppled electrical
power station, a ruptured water main, or a commercial or government building
that caught fire during the night.  After a few months, such pictures would
be moved to page 2, then to page 5, and eventually to page 16, because the
people who publish the news would soon realize that too many readers are
looking at those pictures and thinking &quot;If Israel would be more reasonable,
this kind of thing would not happen&quot;, which is not a message that the
owners and editors of the New York Times or the Washington Post want to
propagate. It is not the kind of message that can be used to excuse breaking
agreements and breaking bones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So violence against property would cost less, in terms
of adverse publicity, but would it have an impact on Israelis?  If they
are not moved by seeing Israeli children die, will they care if they cannot
access the Internet for a few weeks because their local server has been
destroyed, and their records were lost in a fire at municipal offices, and
they cannot water their lawn for three months because emergency delivery
systems only supply enough water for cooking, drinking and bathing?  Astonishingly,
the answer is yes, and it is not because these people are Jews.  Jews are
ultimately the same as everybody else. They are just people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No, it is not because they are Jews; it is because they
are 'haves' (as in 'the haves and the have-nots').  Most poor people, like
most Palestinians, find it difficult to understand most rich people.  They
need to remember the words immortalized by Janis Joplin, &quot;Freedom's
just another word for nothing left to lose.&quot;  Rich people do not have
that freedom, especially rich people who have not earned their wealth. 
That is why they get so upset, so defensive, whether they are up-scale Zionists
or corrupt Palestinian officials, when a little piece of their material
wealth is threatened.  These people would be more chronically distraught
over a deep scratch in the paint of their new car than over the death of
a distant neighbour's child, especially if the scratch is located where
they see it every time they get into the car, and it reappears two weeks
after they spent 1,200 shekels to have it repaired.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The New Intifadah should take advantage of the freedom
of the poor and the curse of the rich.  Palestinians must realize that they
will get a better return on 100 kilograms of sugar, slipped 1 kilogram at
a time into 100 Israeli gas tanks, than they will get from a suicide bomb
that kills ten children.  And better to poison a Mercedes than a Fiat. 
If you can seriously inconvenience the rich, the rich will compromise. 
South Africa abandoned apartheid when it began to hurt the high-end 'haves'
economically, when it became difficult for them to get maids and servants,
and when the distance between the rich and their less fortunate White countrymen
began to shrink.  'Haves' are the same all over the world.  Aim for their
wallets, not their hearts.  Their rear pocket is more vulnerable than their
shirt pocket.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And when you do that, do it against the background of an
alternative that will strike every enlightened person on the face of the
earth as fair, reasonable and right.  Propose a new nation for the Middle
East&shy;a nation in which no citizen will be discriminated against, or
receive privileges, on the basis of religion.  Propose that Israel, without
the Golan Heights, join the West Bank and Gaza.  This new country should
not be called Israel and it should not be called Palestine.  Any other name
would be acceptable, but I suggest New Canaan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Propose that all current inhabitants of Israel, the West
Bank and Gaza would be citizens of New Canaan, and that people residing
outside of New Canaan who were born in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza could
immigrate to New Canaan with their family and receive automatic citizenship.
 Otherwise, immigration policy should be determined by a democratically
elected government in any manner that would not discriminate by religious
affiliation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because the United States has been critically responsible
for creating the circumstances which require such a major solution, it would
also be reasonable to propose that America guarantee the security of New
Canaan's international borders for 15 years subsequent to its creation and
grant expedited U.S. citizenship to any former Israeli citizen of New Canaan
who wishes to immigrate to the United States.  Every stick needs a carrot.
 Let New Canaan be the carrot, and let violence against property be your
stick.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Islamaphobia: its affect on world politics</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Islamaphobia has been a much-talked about subject recently.
 This term was coined to mean &quot;the fear of Islam,&quot; particularly
in the West.  Some would say this is an over-exaggeration or others might
say that it doesn't concern their part of the world.  However, it is a global
concern, for there are Muslims living in every part of the world that may
suffer harassment or worse owing to Islamaphobia.  Not only does Islamaphobia
concern all Muslims, but also the rest of the world population who are being
led to fear Islam and Muslims, thus causing certain problems, misunderstandings
and unnecessary hatred.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why has this come about?  Well certain groups of people
or certain personalities have led campaigns of bigotry against Arabs and
Muslims as well as providing intended, or even unintended, misinformation
about the religion of Islam and its followers.  However, these stereotypes
and misinformation lead back to the West's historical roots. In some English
literature, we find unrealistic portrayals of Muslims and Arabs.  British
poet Lord Byron sided with the Greeks against the Turks in a war, and his
writings have left some impact on the historical mind of the Western people.
 Also, some people today still believe that Arabs and Muslims are backward
and primitive.  Some still think that Arabs live in tents and ride camels,
without knowing that they have universities, hospitals and restaurants.
 The only other information they receive is from films like &quot;Aladdin&quot;
and stories like &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;, which were written hundreds
of years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Western people, especially Americans, are ignorant of
the facts, and no one explains to them the true, genuine Islam.  They see
flashes of misinformation and scenes of violence in some Islamic countries,
so they just assume this comes from the religion of Islam.  However, Islam
is against aggression while supporting one to defend himself from oppression
and injustice.  The root of Islam is 'salaam', meaning 'peace'.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Added to this, certain scholars, politicians and famous
personalities are at odds with Islam and their biased and bigoted remarks
are imprinted upon the public. Thus, such people influence public opinion
and government policies.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We find American policy turned against world Muslims;
they even encourage the United Nations and the world at large to go against
Muslims.  We find examples of such behaviour when we see America initiating
embargoes and sanctions against Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Iran.  Why are they
lighting the fire and trying to make wars while causing the people of these
countries to suffer?  If anyone wants to deal with these countries and to
show them any sympathy, they get penalized.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The United Nations agreed with Iraq to allow them a food-for-oil
deal; however, Iraq complains that the process is moving very slow due to
the needed approval of the UN sanctions committee.  Also, a humanitarian
group, Voices in the Wilderness, recently took medicine to the Iraqi people
to ease their suffering, even though it was prohibited for Americans to
visit Iraq and to give aid.  Then, upon their return, customs agents confiscated
the videos they had taken of the people's suffering, and now they face charges
from the American government.  What's the harm in helping suffering people?
The showdown is between the American government and Saddam Hussein. Children
are dying in Iraq from lack of food and medicine.  There are now more cases
of leukemia among children. Operating rooms and incubators are out of commission
due to lack of spare parts and lack of anesthesia.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The American government rushed to the aid of Kuwait, but
they waited to the very end of the battle to initiate some kind of mediation
in Bosnia. Why did they falter when people were being massacred?  Only because
they were Muslims?  I guess they had no oil and no strategic military purpose.
Besides, they were only Muslims&shy;were they humans like themselves? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Other countries have tortured and are torturing Muslims
now with no one coming to their rescue.  For example, Burma tortured the
Muslims in their country until they fled and now live as refugees.  Kashmir
and India have harassed, tortured and killed Muslims; they have destroyed
their property and places of worship.  They disrespect them in many ways.
 Yet, the world does nothing.  The Turkish soldiers are slaughtering the
Kurds.  Yet, no sanctions are initiated against Turkey.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Turkey is trying to gain a Western image so it can join
the European countries. Yet, it remains rejected by Europe owing to its
own human rights violations.  However, the U.S. still deals with the Turks.
The Turkish, Israeli and American forces are joining together for military
exercises.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Turkey even abuses its own Muslim population. It has closed
Islamic schools, and forced out the Islamic Refah (Welfare) Party led by
Erbakan. Turkey fears Islam because it wants to keep a secular image. Some
women wearing Islamic dress have received harsh treatment from fellow Turkish
people and their opportunities are limited.  Why are the Turks afraid of
Islam?  Erbakan and the Refah Party gained influence through the democratic
process. It was fair.  Now, the government has outlawed the Refah Party.
We find the country preaches democracy but doesn't practice it. In the past,
when the army didn't like a government, they staged coups. Still no sanctions
are initiated against them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The worst incident of Islamaphobia is when the federal
building in Oklahoma was bombed.  Major newspapers and government sources
immediately suspected Islamic terrorists. Muslims in the U.S. were harassed
and threatened and even Islamic centres and mosques were vandalized. The
irresponsibility of the media to present a balanced report of the news as
well as the latent fear that already existed in the minds of Americans,
who have been conditioned for years to fear Islam and Muslims, led to a
surprised public when the bomber turned out to be a militant, white American.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If Americans and Europeans would visit any Arab or Muslim
country, then maybe they'd lose some of their fear as they realize all humans
are basically the same and that Islam is a religion of peace and good ethics.
They would find Arabs, in general, and Muslims, in particular, to be hospitable
and friendly as well as peaceful. Not all Muslims should be blamed for the
acts of a few people, yet it is in human nature to uphold stereotypes, unfortunately.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Islamaphobia has a great impact on politics and government
policies. We find President Bill Clinton in a showdown against Iraq and
Iran. In general, he has sided with the Israelis against the Palestinians,
even after Israeli atrocities and even after the world found out that the
Israeli society supports torture against Palestinians. No world court has
ever punished the Israeli government for its human rights violations.  Even
the Israeli court has allowed certain methods of torture, thus opening the
way for new and experimental methods of torture.  Now, as in the past, the
Israelis want to destroy the Dome of the Rock Mosque and Al-Aqsa Mosque,
the third holiest site in Islam, in Jerusalem.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israeli extremists are itching to start a war with all
Muslims by insulting the Muslims and their religion. Last summer, an Israeli
drew a pig and put the name &quot;Muhammad&quot; under it to insult the
Prophet of Islam. Then, recently, two Jewish extremists were arrested for
planning to throw a pig's head wrapped in pages of the Qur'an into Al-Aqsa
Mosque. However, these abuses against a respected world religion and the
Palestinians have almost gone unnoticed as world governments try to force
a failing peace process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In his programme, Robertson said of American converts
to Islam: &quot;Any thinking American to embrace Islam is nothing short
of insanity&quot; and he called the Muslims slave-traders and asked, &quot;Why
would people in America want to embrace the religion of the slavers?&quot;
It is usual for Robertson to insult Arabs and Muslims on his show, which
is viewed by millions. &quot;Robertson's group was among the strongest advocates
for the congressionally passed 'Jerusalem Embassy Bill' and other anti-Palestinian
legislation,&quot; says Dr. Zogby. Imagine if he gets to become president,
then what will he do to increase the fear of Islam and the bigotry against
Muslims? What harmful political decisions will he make?  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Islamaphobia is a growing reality. When it affects world
politics, then it affects all Muslims and non-Muslims as well.  How can
it be stopped? Only through world Muslims educating non-Muslims about the
true Islam and what it really stands for. Also, it would help if non-Muslims
around the world would have an open mind, not believe everything they hear
or read and would search for the truth from a Muslim. If they befriend a
practicing Muslim, then they may learn something of the religion and lessen
their fear of Muslims.  </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Something must be done for Algeria</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khaled Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As the grisly slaughter of innocent people in Algeria continues
relentlessly, the military-dominated government in that despotism-stricken
North African Arab Muslim country has so far adamantly refused any international
effort to &quot;know what is going on there.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Usually, the ready-made excuse for this refusal, which
is no longer acceptable given the huge scale of blood-letting, is &quot;interference
in our internal affairs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is not a genuine excuse for two reasons: first, the
Algerian government has failed scandalously, to put it mildly, to protect
its own citizenry. The government doesn't allow independent journalists
and human rights workers to search for the truth &quot;lest they discover
what should remain secret.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, a government, such as the one in Algeria, that
views the massive killing (bordering on extermination) of its own citizens
from the public relations and parochial political standpoints loses its
very raison d'&ecirc;tre and all and any forms of legitimacy whatsoever.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The other reason, however, is the most significant in all
this haze engulfing the Algerian tragedy. We all know that there have been
consistent reports from the &quot;field&quot; in Algeria suggesting that
the government and its various military, paramilitary, and civilian agencies
of killing, such as the notorious death squads known as &quot;le eradicateurs&quot;,
are responsible for much, if not most, of the killings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact that at least some of the recent massacres took
place only a few hundred metres away from army garrisons, suggest unmistakable
government responsibility and complicity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The government is also clearly incriminated by the fact
that the bulk of killings have targeted villagers who had voted for the
Islamic Salvation Front in 1992, which warrants the question &quot;Who is
killing whom?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are many more signs suggesting active and indirect
army involvement in the ongoing carnage. The fact that the Algerian authorities
cordoned off the regions where the killings take place, barring independent
journalists from reaching the sites, suggests unmistakably that the government
has something to hide from the people and the world.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Added to that is the shroud of vagueness surrounding the
so-called &quot;Islamic extremists&quot; whom the Algerian government routinely
accuses of carrying out the massacres.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It has been reported for some time now that the &quot;armed
Islamic group&quot;, originally a small breakaway faction of FIS, has been
heavily infiltrated by the Algerian army agents to the point of its becoming
a ruthless government tool against the mainstream FIS and the Islamist phenomenon
in Algeria as a whole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, in light of all of this, it is imperative for the world
to break the deafening barrier of silence and do something. Unfortunately,
we can't expect much from the West, especially France and the United States,
which have sought to sustain the Algerian junta in power ever since the
latter cancelled the 1991 elections which FIS was poised to win.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for the Muslim world, it is sufficiently safe to say
that its reaction to the unabated spilling of Muslim blood in Algeria has
been a great disgrace. After all, many of the governments in the Islamic
countries are of the same ilk of L'amin Zeoural's junta.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Islamic Republic of Iran is probably the only
Islamic country that has voiced genuine concerns over the Algerian genocide.
 But that is not enough. Iran, by virtue of being Chairman of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC), is called on to take the initiative to
give Algerian Muslims new hope.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The military junta in Algeria would undoubtedly be dismayed
and likely reject any &quot;foreign interference in the internal Algerian
affairs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Notwithstanding, this shouldn't discourage Iran, the contemporary
leader of the Muslim world, from trying to do what all Muslims should have
done a long time ago&shy;stop the bloodshed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, if the OIC stands powerless to do something vis-&agrave;-vis
the Algerian case, what raison d'&ecirc;tre will it still have?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Algeria:  Savage butchers on the loose</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Why did this happen?  Why didn't anybody stop it?
 There's no law anymore!!&quot; reported to Amnesty International by one
of the survivors of a massacre that took place at Sedi Rayis, located to
the south of the capital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Since 1992, Algeria has been trapped in a vicious circle
of violence.  It first broke out when the army stepped in and claimed a
sweeping victory over the Islamic Salvation Front in the national elections.
 Revenge for what happened took the form of violence.  Things just got out
of control, and a lot of &quot;WHYs&quot; grew louder and louder by the
day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	During the holy month of Ramadan, it was expected that
the massacres would stop, but to the contrary new records were set in an
even uglier and crueler way.  Thus the &quot;Why?&quot; still stands; the
&quot;Who?&quot; still puzzling as ever; and the cries of &quot;For how
long?&quot; tirelessly echoing the desperateness of hundreds of thousands
of helpless citizens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the beginning, some Islamic groups did, in fact, get
carried away in the aftermath of the lost victory and committed some acts
of violence, especially those targeting the army and security forces.  However,
the ongoing violence in Algeria suggests, despite testimonies of those who
survived the massacres, that the army and security forces are involved,
either in the killings themselves or in the covering up for the perpetrators.
 This could be accomplished by passivity or by intimidating eyewitnesses
and journalists, especially considering that most massacres take place close
to army troop points or among strong supporters of the Islamic groups.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A recent testimony by a former member of the Algerian
Intelligence Service confirms the involvement of the army generals in the
terrorist acts.  The individual cited mere greed as their motive, since
they are seeking to own vast areas of land.  The only way to accomplish
this goal is to damage the overall favourable image of the Islamic groups
in the eyes of the public.  For over a year, the Islamists have been calling
for a dialogue with the Algerian leaders to secure a truce and eventually
peace in the country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	What is very strange is that the government is insisting
that those responsible for the horrifying slaughter of innocent people are
none other than the Islamic groups!  Why won't the government agree to an
independent investigation to pinpoint those directly responsible and thereby
justly prosecuted?  The government's silence is contributing to the rising
death toll as the perpetrators continue their heinous acts in absolute immunity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	No one would argue that a State's sovereignty is a very
important issue to be respected, but to keep hiding behind it, using the
phrase &quot;internal affairs&quot;, has nothing to do with making a genuine
effort to stop the bloodshed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The crisis in Algeria is a stain of shame on the forehead
of humanity.  It is as if someone is determined to turn the whole country
into a ghost town.  One really wonders what is there to gain by terrorizing
the peaceful civilians or by causing waves of refugees to cross the international
borders into neighbouring African countries or to European countries across
the Mediterranean.  Definitely the answer is not arming the unarmed because
that's just adding fuel to the fire; the spread of weaponry is not the answer.
 What is really needed is a firm stand on behalf of the government, an iron
fist to control the crazy spiral of violence that the country is caught
in.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish History, Jewish Religion</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Israel Shahak</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I have always known Shahak to be
a prodigious historian, brilliant intellectual and polymath scholar, and
political activist, but I have come to realize his central 'hobby' has been
a study of Judaism, of the rabbinical and Talmudic traditions, and of the
scholarship on the subject..&quot; Edward Said</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestine Times will publish Professor Shahak's book
in parts.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Part 1</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A Closed Utopia?</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This book, although written in English and addressed to
people living outside the State of Israel, is, in a way, a continuation
of my political activities as an Israeli Jew. Those activities began in
1965-6 with a protest which caused a considerable scandal at the time: I
had personally witnessed an ultra-religious Jew refuse to allow his phone
to be used on the Sabbath in order to call an ambulance for a non-Jew who
happened to have collapsed in his Jerusalem neighbourhood. Instead of simply
publishing the incident in the press, I asked for a meeting with the members
of the Rabbinical Court of Jerusalem, which is composed of rabbis nominated
by the State of Israel. I asked them whether such behaviour was consistent
with their interpretation of the Jewish religion. They answered that the
Jew in question had behaved correctly, indeed piously, and backed their
statement by referring me to a passage in an authoritative compendium of
 Talmudic laws, written in this century. I reported the incident to the
main Hebrew daily, Ha'aretz, whose publication of the story caused a media
scandal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The results of the scandal were, for me, rather negative.
Neither the Israeli, nor the diaspora, rabbinical authorities ever reversed
their ruling that a Jew should not violate the Sabbath in order to save
the life of a Gentile. They added much sanctimonious twaddle to the effect
that if the consequence of such an act puts Jews in danger, the violation
of the Sabbath is permitted, for their sake. It became apparent to me, as
drawing on knowledge acquired in my youth, I began to study the Talmudic
laws governing the relation between Jews and non-Jews, that neither Zionism,
including its seemingly secular part, nor Israeli politics since the inception
of the State of Israel, nor particularly the policies of the Jewish supporters
of Israel in the diaspora, could be understood unless the deeper influence
of those laws, and the world view, which they both create and express is
taken into account. The actual policies Israel pursued after the Six Day
War, and in particular the apartheid character of the Israeli regime in
the Occupied Territories and the attitude of the majority of Jews to the
issue of the rights of the Palestinians, even in the abstract, have merely
strengthened this conviction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Defining the Jewish State</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Without  a discussion of the prevalent Jewish attitudes
to non-Jews, even the concept of Israel as 'a Jewish slate', as Israel formally
defines itself, cannot be understood. The widespread misconception that
Israel, even without considering its regime in the Occupied Territories,
is a true democracy arises from the refusal to confront the significance
of the term 'a Jewish state' for non-Jews. In my view, Israel as a Jewish
state constitutes a danger not only to itself and its inhabitants, but to
all Jews and to all other peoples and states in the Middle East and beyond.
I also consider that other Middle Eastern states or entities which define
themselves as 'Arab' or 'Muslim', like the Israeli self-definition as being
'Jewish', likewise constitute a danger. However, while this danger is widely
discussed, the danger inherent in the Jewish character of the State of Israel
is not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 	The principle of Israel as  'a Jewish state' was supremely
important to Israeli politicians from the inception of the state and was
inculcated into the Jewish population by all conceivable ways. When,  in
the early 1980s, a tiny minority of Israeli Jews emerged which opposed this
concept, a Constitutional Law (that is, a law overriding provisions of other
laws, which cannot be revoked except by a special procedure) was passed
in 1985 by an enormous majority of the Knesset. By this law no party whose
programme openly opposes the principle of 'a Jewish state, or proposes to
change it by democratic means, is allowed to participate in the elections
of the Knesset. I myself strongly oppose this constitutional principle.
The legal  consequence for me is that I cannot belong, in the state of 
which I am a citizen, to a party having principles with which I would agree
and which is allowed to participate in Knesset elections. Even this example
shows that the State of Israel is not a democracy due to the application
of a Jewish ideology directed against all non-Jews and those Jews who oppose
this ideology. But the danger which this dominant ideology represents is
not limited to domestic affairs. It also influences Israeli foreign policies.
This danger will continue to grow, as long as two currently operating developments
are being strengthened: The increase in the Jewish character of Israel and
the increase in its power, particularly in nuclear power. Another ominous
factor is that Israeli influence in the USA political establishment is also
increasing. Hence accurate information about Judaism, and especially about
the treatment of non-Jews by Israel, is now not only important, but politically
vital as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let me begin with the official Israeli definition of the
term 'Jewish', illustrating the crucial difference between Israel as 'a
Jewish state' and the majority of other states. By this official definition,
Israel 'belongs' to persons who are defined by the Israeli authorities as
'Jewish', irrespective of where they live, and to them alone. On the other
hand, Israel doesn't officially 'belong' to its non-Jewish citizens, whose
status is considered even officially as inferior. This means in practice
that if members of a Peruvian tribe are converted to Judaism, and thus regarded
as Jewish, they are entitled at once to become Israeli citizens and benefit
from the approximately 70 per cent of the West Bank land (and the 92 per
cent of the area of Israel proper), officially designated only for the benefit
of Jews. All non-Jews, (not only all Palestinians) are prohibited from benefiting
from those lands. (The prohibition applies even to Israeli Arabs who served
in the Israeli army and reached a high rank.) The case involving Peruvian
converts to Judaism actually occurred a few years ago. The newly-created
Jews were settled in the West Bank, near Nablus on land from which non-Jews
are officially excluded. All Israeli governments are taking enormous political
risks, including the risk of war, so that such settlements, composed exclusively
of persons who are defined as 'Jewish' (and not Israeli as most of the media
mendaciously claims) would be subject to only 'Jewish' authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	I suspect that the Jews of the USA or of Britain would
regard it as antisemitic if  Christians would propose that the USA or the
United Kingdom should become a 'Christian state', belonging only to citizens
officially defined as 'Christians'. The consequence of such doctrine is
that Jews converting to Christianity would become full citizens because
of their conversion. It should be recalled that the benefits of conversions
are well known to Jews from their own history. When the Christian and the
Islamic states used to discriminate against all persons not belonging to
the religion of the state, including the Jews, the discrimination against
Jews was at once removed by their conversion. But a non-Jew discriminated
against by the State of Israel will cease to be so treated the moment he
or she converts to Judaism. This simply shows that the same kind of exclusivity
that is regarded by a majority of the diaspora Jews as antisemitic is regarded
by the majority of all Jews as Jewish. To oppose both antisemitism and Jewish
chauvinism is widely regarded among Jews as a 'self-hatred', a concept which
I regard as nonsensical.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The meaning of the term 'Jewish'' and its cognates, including
'Judaism', thus becomes in the context of Israeli politics as important
as the meaning of 'Islamic' when officially used by Iran or 'communist'
when it was officially used by the USSR. However, the meaning of the term
'Jewish' as it is popularly used is not clear, either in Hebrew or when
translated into other languages, and so the term had to be defined officially.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to Israeli law a person is considered 'Jewish'
if either their mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother
were Jewesses by religion; or if the person was converted to Judaism in
a way satisfactory to the Israeli authorities, and on condition that the
person has not converted from Judaism to another religion, in which case
Israel ceases to regard them as 'Jewish'. Of the three conditions, the first
represents the Talmudic definition of 'who is a Jew', a definition followed
by Jewish Orthodoxy. The Talmud and post Talmudic rabbinic law also recognise
the conversion of a non-Jew to Judaism (as well as the purchase of a non-Jewish
slave by a Jew followed by a different kind of conversion) as a method of
becoming Jewish, provided that the conversion is performed by authorised
rabbis in a proper manner. This 'proper manner' entails, for females, their
inspection by three rabbis while naked in a bath of purification', a ritual
which, although notorious to all readers of  the Hebrew press, is not often
mentioned by the English media in spite of its undoubted interest for certain
readers. I hope that this book will be the beginning of a process which
will rectify this discrepancy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But there is another urgent necessity for an official
definition of  who is, and who is not 'Jewish' . The State of Israel officially
discriminates in favour of Jews and against non-Jews in many domains of
life, of which I regard three as being most important: residency rights,
the right to work and the right to equality before the law. Discrimination
in residency is based on the fact that about 92 per cent of Israel's land
is the property of the state and is administered by the Israel Land Authority
according to regulations issued by the Jewish National Fund (JNF ), an affiliate
of the World Zionist Organization. In its regulations the JNF denies the
right to reside, to open a business, and often also to work, to anyone who
is not Jewish, only because he is not Jewish. At the same time, Jews are
not prohibited from taking residence or opening businesses anywhere in Israel.
If applied in another state against the Jews, such discriminatory practice
would instantly and justifiably be labeled antisemitism and would no doubt
spark massive public protests. When applied by Israel as a part of its 'Jewish
ideology', they are usually studiously ignored or excused when rarely mentioned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The denial of the right to work means that non-Jews are
prohibited officially from working on land administered by the Israel Land
Authority according to the JNF regulations.  No doubt these regulations
are not always, or even often, enforced but they do exist. From time to
time Israel attempts enforcement campaigns by state authorities, as, for
example, when the Agriculture Ministry acts against 'the pestilence of 
letting fruit orchards belonging to Jews and situated on National Land [i.e.,
land belonging to the State of Israel] be harvested by Arab labourers',
even if the labourers in question are citizens of Israel. Israel also strictly
prohibits Jews settled on 'National Land' to sub-rent even a part of their
land to Arabs, even for a short time; and those who do so are punished,
usually by heavy fines. There is no prohibition on non-Jews renting their
land to Jews. This means, in my own case, that by virtue of being a Jew
I have the right to lease an orchard for harvesting its produce from another
Jew, but a non-Jew, whether a citizen of Israel or a resident alien, does
not have this right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Non-Jewish citizens of Israel do not have the right to
equality before the law. This discrimination is expressed in many Israeli
laws in which, presumably in order to avoid embarrassment, the terms 'Jewish'
and 'non-Jewish' are usually not explicitly stated, as they are in the crucial
Law of  Return. According to that law only persons officially recognised
as 'Jewish' have an automatic right of entry to Israel and of settling in
it. They automatically receive an 'immigration certificate' which provides
them on arrival with 'citizenship by virtue of having returned to the Jewish
homeland', and with the right to many financial benefits, which vary somewhat
according to the country from which they emigrated. The Jews who emigrate
from the states of the former USSR receive 'an absorption grant' of more
than $20,000 per family. All Jews immigrating to Israel according to this
law immediately acquire the right to vote in elections and to be elected
to the Knesset - even if they do not speak a word of Hebrew.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other Israeli laws substitute the more obtuse expressions
'anyone who can immigrate in accordance with the Law of Return' and 'anyone
who is not entitled to immigrate in accordance with the Law of Return.'
Depending on the law in question, benefits are then granted to the first
category and systematically denied to the second. The routine means for
enforcing discrimination in everyday life is the ID card, which everyone
is obliged to carry at all times. ID cards list the official 'nationality'
of a person, which can be 'Jewish', 'Arab', 'Druze' and the like, with the
significant exception of 'Israeli'. Attempts to force the Interior Minister
to allow Israelis wishing to be officially described as 'Israeli',  or even
as 'Israeli-Jew' in their ID cards have failed. Those who have attempted
to do so have received a letter from the Ministry of Interior stating that
'it was decided not to recognise an Israeli nationality'.  The letter does
not specify who made this decision or when.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are so many laws and regulations in Israel which
discriminate in favour of the persons defined as those 'who can immigrate
in accordance with the Law of Return' that the subject demands separate
treatment. We can look here at one example, seemingly trivial in comparison
with residence restrictions, but nevertheless important since it reveals
the real intentions of the Israeli legislator. Israeli citizens who left
the country for a time but who are defined as those who 'can immigrate in
accordance with the Law of Return' are eligible on their return to generous
customs benefits, to receive subsidy for their children's high school education,
and to receive either a grant or a loan on easy terms for the purchase of
an apartment, as well as other benefits. Citizens who cannot be so defined,
on other words, the non-Jewish citizens of Israel, get none of these benefits.
The obvious intention of such discriminatory measures is to decrease the
number of non-Jewish citizens of Israel, in order to make Israel a more
'Jewish' state.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Trust in Allah</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some people in the world today, who consider themselves
&quot;modern&quot;, believe that real &quot;truth&quot; is in the eye of
the beholder and that between truth and wrong there exist grey areas of
leniency. These people are gravely mistaken, for truth does exist.  The
truth is with Allah, and He has sent Messengers and Messages to tell us
the truth and to guide us. Allah says in the Qur'an, &quot;Truth stands
out clear from error&quot; (2:256). When the world ends and we are all dead,
the only truth and reality facing us will be Allah.  So, we should seek
the truth now and prepare ourselves for our future life.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, being human, we let the life of this world sidetrack
us.  We are busy earning money, earning degrees, having children, amusing
ourselves with the latest technology and we forget our duties to Allah;
we actually live in a dream world. This life is like a short dream while
the Hereafter is an eternal reality. We must wake up and not join the unbelievers
who numb their senses with amusements in order to stop themselves from thinking.
 &quot;The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and
they scoff at those who believe&quot; (Qur'an 2:212).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We must keep in mind that this life is an exam from Allah,
and if we do well, then we'll be in Paradise; however, if we refuse to worship
our Creator and cause mischief in this life, then we'll be in the Hell-fire.
 We must realize the temptations of this life and how to avoid them.  Always
remember the advice Allah gave in the Qur'an, &quot;That which is on earth
We have made but as a glittering show for the earth, in order that We may
test them&shy;as to which of them are best in conduct.  Verily what is on
earth We shall make but as dust and dry soil (without growth or herbage)&quot;
(18:7-8).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Keeping this in mind, we should go through life as a traveler
and pick up the supplies we'll need for the next life&shy;good deeds.  We
have to keep this and our other purposes in mind.  First, Allah created
us to worship only Him.  Secondly, He placed us on the earth as a vicegerent
to support justice and to put down evil.  We are to carry the truth throughout
the world.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some Muslims today say that it is impossible in today's
world to carry out the Islamic mission. Many complain that Muslims are being
assaulted from all sides. This is true, yet we still must stick to the mission
of our lives and not despair.  Allah tells us in the Qur'an, &quot;Do not
despair of Allah's Mercy&quot; (39:53). There are many methods of jihad
(struggle). We can speak, write, change things, protest and fight, if necessary.
The greatest jihad is the personal jihad.  We must change ourselves before
we can change others.  So, we must be great role models of the true Islam.
 If we really lived Islam in the way it should be lived, then according
to Said Nursi, a Kurdish scholar during this century, &quot;If we were to
display through our deeds the perfections contained in the ethics of Islam
and the truths of faith, the followers of other religions would definitely
enter Islam, in masses; indeed, certain continents and States would also
join Islam&quot; (The Damascus Sermon).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Indeed, in today's world, to practice Islam is becoming
increasingly hard.  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) predicted that one day practicing
Islam would be like &quot;holding hot coals&quot; (Hadith).  Yet, imagine
the great reward we'd receive from Allah for our patience and strength during
such hard times.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We must be courageous, brave and self-sacrificing.  The
next life is the most important because it'll last forever.  So, we must
be righteous and ready to serve Allah in any cause that we can.  We must
support the truth and put down injustice and oppression.  The Prophet told
us that &quot;if we see something wrong, we should change it with our hand,
but if we can't, then with our tongue, and if we still can't, then we must
hate it in our hearts, which is the least of faith&quot; (Hadith).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We should not make excuses and say that if things were
easier, then we'd do them.  We must always strive for righteousness, even
if we fear the loss of our property or our own lives.  &quot;And there is
the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure of Allah; and Allah
is full of kindness to (His) devotees.  Oh, you who believe!  Enter into
Islam whole-heartedly and follow not the footsteps of the Evil One, for
he is to you an avowed enemy!&quot; (2:207-208).  The Prophet said, &quot;The
one most honourable in Allah's estimation is the one most pious&quot; (Bukhari
and Muslim).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On the Day of Judgment, Allah will ask us what we did
with the possessions He gave us. Did we abuse them or did we use them to
gain His pleasure and to work righteousness? The Prophet said, &quot;Allah
does not look at your forms or your possessions, but He looks at your hearts
and your deeds&quot; (Muslim).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We must weigh the important things in this life and never
waste our time, talents or possessions. Everything should be used to gain
Allah's pleasure. Each of us can do something for Islam and to help other
Muslims, as well as other human beings, even if it is some small act. If
we do so, we should know that Allah is always ready to reward us; no small
deed goes unnoticed. Allah says, &quot;Whoever works righteousness, man
or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a new life, a life
that is good and pure, and We will bestow on such their reward according
to the best of their actions&quot; (16:97), and &quot;Oh, My servants who
believe!  Fear your Lord.  Good is (the reward) for those who do good in
this world.  Spacious is Allah's earth!  Those who patiently persevere will
truly receive a reward without measure!&quot; (39:10). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We should be open to do whatever we can to help those
in need, whether it is the beggar, the poor, the orphan or the oppressed.
 We must speak out the truth, no matter to whom we are speaking.  &quot;The
best striving (jihad) is uttering a word of truth before an unjust sultan&quot;
(Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	To perfect our faith, we must have unlimited trust in
Allah, for He never forsakes his faithful servants.  We must remember, no
matter how much we fear the unbelievers and their armies or the wicked rulers
or unjust men, that Allah is with those who truly have faith and trust in
Him.  Allah says, &quot;Whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah has grasped
the most trustworthy Hand-hold that never breaks, and Allah hears and knows
all things.  Allah is the Protector of those who have faith&quot; (2:256-257).
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We must know that Allah has all the Power.  Miraculous
things have happened in the past and in today's life.  We only need a strong
iman (faith).  Allah sent angels to help the Prophet fight the unbelievers
in the Battle of Badr, and though the Muslims were greatly outnumbered,
they still achieved a victory.  Even in this century, a great example of
fighting against great numbers of soldiers and without sufficient weapons
can be seen in the Battle of Karameh; the Palestinians and Muslims won.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Allah is always on the side of justice, and all we have
to do is to join Him in this justice, then we'll truly be victorious&shy;in
this life and in the next.  </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Miller</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Once, when imperialism was still the rage and its oppression
felt around the world, in a certain land, honey bees buzzed and orange blossoms
hung in clusters in the thick orchards of one man by the name of Abdul Haleem.
 He lived in relative peace and contentment on the same land that his forefathers
had tilled with love and patience for eons gone by.  He was sort of an aristocrat
in his &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; and had many children who played for hours
in the summer sun between their water pump and the dirt, taking turns rolling
and fighting in the rich red earth and then showering in the sprinkling
system all over again. Although Abdul Haleem was known to be kind and generous,
he was also respected and feared by his neighbors and relatives and, for
miles around, his reputation had spread about his daring feats of bravery
and the honesty of his spoken word. One afternoon, while he was sitting
on the porch of his house drinking in the scent of his orchard under the
shade of a huge mulberry tree, a distant relative of his approached.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Uncle,&quot; the young man said politely, &quot;I've
got a very urgent request.  I hope you can help me.&quot;  He stood wrenching
his hands and fidgeted nervously.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Well, what is it man? Speak up! I have no time for
people who beat around the bush,&quot; the uncle said, his hazel eyes at
work scrutinizing his nephew.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I've come to ask for your protection. In the village
where I live, no one can come or go without the consent and approval of
our rich landlord who governs us. I must leave that village. I am a poor
miller who is trying to support my family and business is very bad in my
village. I know you to be brave and just.  Please accompany me back to my
home so that I may get my wife and children and move somewhere else.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Haleem could smell excitement in the air and he loved
a challenge, besides, he never refused a request for help. &quot;You have
nothing to fear,&quot; he said happily, &quot;I will go with you and see
what I can do.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And he did.  In the black of night when the only light
was the pale yellow moon, he and the miller rode past watermelon patches,
apple groves, fragrant citrus blossoms in thick wooded orchards while they
listened to the laugh of the wild hyena, the howl of the mad dog, the hoot
of the barn owl and the caw of the mockingbird. Although the British Imperialists
forbade the native inhabitants weapons, Abdul Haleem carried his hidden
gun in an old leather pouch.  Every once in a while, he patted it to be
sure that it was still there. He knew that if he was caught with a weapon,
he would immediately be imprisoned so he had to be cautious. After some
time, he and his companion approached the obscure village which lay quiet
and sleepy. &quot;We must go at once and get the landlord's permission for
my leaving. Otherwise, he will surely punish me and probably even beat me,&quot;
said the nephew.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I told you not to be afraid,&quot; Abdul Haleem said
brusquely. He was usually exceptionally good in dealing with men and more
often than not, knew how to handle them. He went up to the landlord's house,
knocked on the door, and after he had a few words with him, returned in
victory to his nephew. The smiling miller embraced his uncle and placed
his Judas kiss on his cheek and said, &quot;Oh, Uncle, I'm so glad that
you were with me.  Now let's go and get my family.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Wait a minute. Where are you planning to take them?&quot;
the concerned uncle queried.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He saw his nephew look at his feet dejectedly and then
answer in a forlorn voice, &quot;I really have no place to go.  I am at
your mercy!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Haleem never refused anyone hospitality so he said,
&quot;you are welcome to live on my land as long as you want!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was a warm feeling to be of service to his poor relative.
 But he didn't have time to be emotional right now. He and his nephew proceeded
to the small house which was home for a wife and a brood of children. Soon,
they had the drowsy family and their meager possessions bundled up on an
old creaky wagon and headed for Abdul Haleem's orchards. Days later after
saturating his nephew with the best food and comfort, the good uncle gave
him a small plot of land free where he could set up his mill and grind wheat.
The two men drew up a verbal contract which went something like this, &quot;I'll
let you live here as long as you like on  the condition that I, my brothers
and my sister and their children grind our grain in your mill without paying
any money.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Oh, no, Uncle, I will grind the grain free for all
your relatives, it is the least I can do to repay you.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the uncle refused, saying that the entire family was
too large and that the miller would never make any profit, so it was agreed
that only the uncle's closest relatives could grind their grain free. A
small but suitable house was then erected on the donated plot and soon the
sound of heavy stones whetting together filled the orchard air.  Everything
went smoothly at first. But, Abdul Haleem's brother was unhappy with the
arrangement. On a cool morning as the two sat outside on the porch, drank
mint tea and smoked their hand rolled and home grown cigarettes, Abdul Haleem's
brother said to him, &quot;I warned you before, you are making a serious
mistake. There will come a time when our nephew will cause trouble, just
wait and see.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Summers came and went. The miller wasn't poor any more.
 Business was good and success had gone to his head. He forgot his uncle's
generosity and kindness and started to complain to his wife. &quot;I will
never be rich if  I keep grinding all uncles' family's grain free.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Just refuse to do it then,&quot; said the wife matter
of factly, forgetting that time when her husband's uncle had saved her and
her family from misery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So the coward who had once taken advantage of his uncle
then refused to grind anyone's grain free. Abdul Haleem was furious when
he found out what was going on. When he confronted his nephew he was answered
with, &quot;But Uncle, no one said they can't mill their grain here.  They
just have to pay like everyone else.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He had not reckoned dealing with his uncle's anger and
inspite of his fear, he tried to gain support and advice from another leading
family in the village. But to his chagrin he was told, &quot;No, we won't
help you against our good friend. How can you act this way after all he's
done for you?  He gave you land when you had no place to go.  Have you no
shame?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However rather than letting his uncle's family use his
mill free, he moved his business to another town but still kept some of
his family on the gifted plot of land so that he could keep his claim to
the area.  Then one day, the invaders came and nothing remained the same.
 Everyone lost their homes and land, including the innocent and the greedy.
Abdul Haleem's seed became refugees but later again prospered. But the nephew
became poor once again and never succeeded. On a quiet day, if you look
past the sprawling settlements of a  people who confiscated a land not theirs
and now don't love it as its former owners once did, if you listen carefully,
you can still hear the old mill grinding, children laughing while they splash
in the orchard fountains and smell Abdul Haleem's home grown and hand rolled
cigarettes as he sits on his porch beneath his beloved mulberry tree in
the land of milk and honey. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gone are those beautiful scenes and innocent days that
at one time seemed would last forever. Here to stay it appears is a tyrannical
rule of oppression and bloodshed. The seed of Adbul Haleem has been dispersed
across the four corners of the globe and forever is gone those carefree
times when life was beautiful and simple.</FONT></P>
