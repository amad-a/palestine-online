Nablus</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nablus</b> <b>(Occupied West Bank) &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Belying PA and Israeli allegations that support for Hamas was plummeting,
over 50,000 Palestinians converged at Nablus Friday, 25 June, to mark the annual
anniversary of the Prophet Muhammed's birthday.<img src="pic1.jpg" width="244" height="331" alt="pic#1.jpg (283109 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2"></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bulk of the huge multitude were young Palestinians from the city
itself and surrounding rural areas, which shows that Palestinian youngsters are, for the
most part, still looking to Hamas for the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The thousands of Islamist young men and women shouted in unison &quot;God
is Great&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem is ours forever&quot; and &quot;Hamas! We are your
soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Huge portraits of Islamic Holy Places and verses from the Holy
Qur&#146;an, emblazoned in beautiful calligraphy, decorated the site of the rally.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several speakers saluted the huge rally, including Allama (intellectual
authority) Sheikh Yousef al-Qaradawi, who spoke via telephone from Qatar.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qaradawi called on all Palestinians to stand united in the face of their
enemy in defense of their homeland and Holy Places.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I urge all the sons and daughters of Palestine to stand united in
the face of the common enemy,&quot; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added, &quot;Whether you are members of the police force or ordinary
citizens, you are all believers in God, and must stand united in this confrontation
against this sinister enemy that thrives on our division and disunity.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qaradawi urged Muslims worldwide to pay more attention to the message of
the Prophet and to seek to translate it in their daily life and in all aspects of their
societies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We are not only celebrating the birth of the Messenger; we are
celebrating the birth of the message, so let us get incentive from this occasion to
increase our awareness of the message and the Messenger.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas leaders, for their part, urged the Palestinian Authority to take
real, sincere and earnest action to cement national unity among Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;It is never enough to wish for national unity; it is never enough to
speak about it; you must, we must, work for it and sacrifice for it,&quot; said Jamal
Salim, a prominent Islamist leader in the Nablus area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salim said Hamas was always extending its hands to the Palestinian
Authority for national reconciliation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas, he said, always placed national interests above all considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We will not allow schism to divide us, and we will not allow
Palestinian blood to be shed, and we will continue to be the safety valve for our people
and our cause.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salim also pointed out to the &quot;creeping cancer of the
settlements,&quot; saying, &quot;We will not succeed in checking the growth of this
malignancy if we don't unify our ranks and make available to us all alternatives.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, Hamas lauded the recent agreement in Algeria between the FIS and
the Algerian government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We give our blessing for national reconciliation in Algeria and we
express our solidarity with the Islamist movement in Algeria and the Algerian President
and urge them to open a new chapter that would stop bloodshed in the sisterly
country.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Hamed al-Beitawi, the grand Mufti of Nablus, and Head of the
Palestine Ulema Association, warned against &quot;giving up even one iota of
Palestine.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;This is an Islamic land with a decision from God&#133;this is the
sacred land to which the Prophet made his journey by night; this is al-Aqsa Mosque; this
is the first Kibla&#133;and the third of the holiest shrines in all of Islam.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Islamist speakers called on the PA to uphold the rule of law and
guarantee peoples' rights and civil liberties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several rallies were due to take place throughout the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in commemoration of the solemn occasion, including one at al-Aqsa Mosque in East
Jerusalem.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA Attacks NGOs</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>The Palestinian Authority has launched a smear campaign against
non-government organizations (NGOs) operating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, accusing
the heads of these bodies of theft and corruption as well as besmirching the image of
&quot;our people's struggle.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA justice minister Freih Abu Maddin, who spearheaded the campaign,
branded NGOs as &#147;a bunch of thieves&#148;, &#147;fat cats&quot; and &quot;a band of
foreign agents who are working against Palestinian national interests.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;These organizations are serving suspicious goals and their overall
role in our country is by no means constructive,&quot; said Abu Maddin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Maddin told the PA's Voice of Palestine (a mouthpiece for Chairman
Yasser Arafat) that NGOs, particularly the so-called &#147;human rights
organizations&#148;, were only acting at their masters' and financiers' beck and call. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He claimed some NGO directors receive a monthly salary reaching as high as
$10,000, a sum, he said, equals the salaries of ten judges combined.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same charges were parroted several times by PA printed and electronic
media, which charged that NGOs were playing a negative role in the march of the
Palestinian struggle and were purposefully distorting the image of the Palestinian
Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These charges, including allegations of financial irregularities, were
vehemently denied by Iyad al Sarraj, a prominent human rights activist in the Gaza Strip
who accused the PA of &quot;launching a discrimination attack on NGOs and human rights
organizations for political reasons.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sarraj argued that the PA, particularly the Justice Minister, was seeking
to punish and discredit human rights organizations for their role &quot;in exposing the
many flaws and violations of human rights and the rule of law under the PA.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He challenged Abu Maddin to name the organization whose director receives
a monthly salary of $10,000.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We reject this indiscriminate vilification of NGOs. If the PA has
evidence of any financial irregularities or wrong-doing against a given organization, it
should name the villain organization,&quot; Sarraj told the Palestinian daily al Quds on
13 June.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basem Eid, Head of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, welcomed
any sincere efforts by the PA to make sure that NGO operations are in full conformity with
the law.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In return, however, Eid demanded that the PA &quot;put its house in
order&quot; and &quot;open its doors to human rights organizations if indeed it has
nothing to hide.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;NGOs have nothing to hide, and the PA should have nothing to hide as
well, especially concerning human rights and the upholding of the rule of law.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The vitriolic attack came two days after Agance France Presse (AFP)
circulated a report from Gaza, describing the PA justice system as &quot;primitive&quot;
and suggesting that PA officials squandered $100 million that had been earmarked for
rebuilding the Palestinian system.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report quoted the Special UN Coordinator in the Gaza Strip as saying
that there is still no real separation of powers in the PA regime and that a thorough
reconstruction of the PA justice system was needed in order to meet requirements for a
modern civil society.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Campaign against NGOs politically motivated</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA campaign against NGOs seems to be first and foremost politically
motivated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is evident from the fact that the ten or so human rights
organizations were singled out from more than 1,000 NGOs currently operating within the
autonomous enclaves and covering a whole range of activities from agriculture to public
health.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the largest NGO in the occupied territory is the Palestinian Red
Crescent Society, headed by Fat&#146;hi Arafat, PA President Yasser Arafat's brother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The finances of the Red Crescent never truly came under scrutiny despite
widespread charges of theft, embezzlement and misspending. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reason for that is, of course, Arafat's proximity to Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA, which is in itself infested with corruption, nepotism and theft,
in addition to embezzlements amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, ostensibly aims
to discredit human rights bodies following the adage &quot;offense is the best
defense.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, in the absence of a free press and a competent judicial authority,
human rights organizations become the premier watchdog monitoring the Palestinian
Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that the PA often finds such a watchdog annoying<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> even disturbing<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> hence the interest to
vilify the NGOs, with the apparent intent to discredit human rights organizations,
particularly the more outspoken amongst them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the campaign comes amidst persistent demands from human rights
organizations for the publication of the Palestinian General Comptroller's Report.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to reliable Palestinian sources, Arafat has suppressed the
publication of the report, arguing that it is politically damaging to release the report
at this time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two years ago, a report issued by the General Comptroller' s Committee
revealed the disappearance of over $300 million, nearly a third of the entire PA budget,
eventually forcing the PA cabinet to resign.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the discredited ministers, whose names the report mentioned in
connection with the scandal, were reinstated or promoted by Yasser Arafat in a new cabinet
reshuffle a few months later.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Weisman: I congratulate Arafat for fighting Hamas</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Ezer Weisman, the President of the Zionist regime, said he was
impressed by the ability of PA Chairman Yaser Arafat to combat Palestinian resistance
against the Israeli occupation.<br>
Weisman said in statements published Saturday Arafat took it upon himself to fight
&quot;terror&quot; and &quot;I congratulate him for that.&quot;<br>
The Zionist leader said the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians shouldn't allowed
to assume a religious nature.<br>
Weisman said Israel would have to avoid the possibility of the conflict with the Arabs
being transformed into a religious conflict.<br>
&quot;What I am trying to avoid with all efforts possible is make sure that the conflict
with us doesn't become religious in nature, I say that because there is a lot of
similarity between Islam and Judaism. Christianity has caused much more harm to us than
Islam has done&#133;Islam treated Jews well until the establishment of Israel, but in
Islam there were no Auscwitz, no concentration camps, nothing of this sort.&quot;<br>
Weisman, whose statements were published in the London-based Arabic daily al Hayat, said
Arafat wouldn't get 100% of the West Bank under any circumstances.<br>
Weisman claimed Arafat was controlling forty per cent of the West Bank, saying Arafat was
in control of Gaza, Jenin, Tulkarm, Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron.<br>
In reality, Arafat doesn't control more than 4% of the West Bank, as the so-called (b)
areas are still controlled by the Israeli army. <br>
Finally, Weisman suggested that the Arabs and Muslims &quot;forget about the
refugees.&quot;<br>
There are four million Palestinian refugees living in the Diaspora, waiting to return to
their homeland from which they expelled in 1948. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Amnesty says PA and Israel torture <br>
detainees, violate human rights</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The London-based Amnesty International has
accused Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority and the Zionist regime of using torture on a
wide scale and of grossly violating human rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In both cases, Palestinians are the victims of these violations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a report covering the year 1998 and published last month, Amnesty
International said the Zionist regime continued to detain Palestinians without charge or
trial for prolonged periods of time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Amnesty pointed out that Palestinian suspects were given lengthy
prison sentences based on confessions extracted from them through torture. &quot;Torture
and ill-treatment continue to be officially sanctioned and used systematically during
interrogation of detainees,&quot; the report said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the Amnesty report pointed out that Israeli security forces
killed 20 Palestinians in vague circumstances over the course of 1998.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report also castigated the PA for employing torture against political
detainees, which resulted in three deaths in 1998. The report blamed the PA for hundreds
of arrests on political grounds, detentions without charges or trials, grossly unfair
trials by State security courts, widespread torture of detainees, and the carrying out of
death sentences on three people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA chairman Yasser Arafat often justifies the gross violations of his
people's human rights and civil liberties by his security forces on the grounds that
Israel and the United States are not interested in seeing true democracy and rule of law
prevail in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the printed and electronic media operating within the
Palestinian autonomous enclaves have chosen to ignore the scathing criticisms of PA human
rights records by &quot;Amnesty International,&quot; and instead focused on the human
rights organization's criticisms of the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The three Palestinian dailies, al-Quds, Alayyam, and al-Hayatul Jadida
featured prominently Amnesty's charges that Israel extracts confessions from Palestinian
detainees under torture and uses these confessions as the main evidence in disingenuous
trials.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist regime employs a variety of torture techniques, including
hooding, beating, electric shocks, sleep deprivation, as well as the notorious shaking
technique which causes brain dislocation and hemorrhage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The law in the Zionist regime sanctions torture (physical and
psychological).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The premier torture means employed by the Palestinian Authority is beating
on the head.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Three Palestinian inmates died of torture in PA jails in 1998.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and political detainees in PA jails
intend to go on an open-ended hunger strike to protest their continued detention,
Palestinian sources said.<br>
The sources said the prisoners and detainees would probably start their hunger strike by
the first of July.<br>
The prisoners and detainees, of whom Islamists make up the vast majority, accuse the PA
and the Zionist regime of reneging on earlier promises to release them.<br>
The prisoners went on a protracted hunger strike last year to pressure Israel and the PA
to release them.<br>
The PA promised the detainees that they would be released and their files would be studied
and re-evaluated.<br>
However, very few prisoners were released and the detainees, most of whom haven't been
accused of any wrong doing, accused the PA of deceiving them. <br>
The PA incarcerates over three hundred Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, mainly to
appease Israeli security whims and to prove to the United States that it is fighting
terrorism. </p>

Crossroads&quot;<br>
conference lash out at Yasser Arafat</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> (24 June) - Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
(PA) received some of the severest criticisms ever during the three-day conference
entitled, &quot;Palestine at the Crossroads&quot;, organized by the Arab Though Forum at
Beir Zeit University from 21-23 June.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A multitude of academics, intellectuals, experts and politicians,
including PA officials, took part in the symposium.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Papers presented during the conference and speeches by guests covered a
wide array of subjects, including diagnoses of the present state of the peace process, the
election of Ehud Barak as Israel's Prime Minister, the expansion of Jewish settlements,
the state of the Palestinian economy, the future of the Oslo process, Palestinian
Statehood and a critique of the Palestinian PA administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The strongest criticisms came from Salim al-Za&#146;anoun, who heads the
Palestinian National Council (PNC). He lashed out at the current PA leadership for its
corruption, incompetence, autocracy and despotism during the plenary session of the
conference.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Za&#146;anoun, an ally of Yasser Arafat but a reluctant supporter of the
peace process, pointed out that the justice system within the self-rule areas was utterly
underdeveloped and even primitive, adding that its overall shape was much worse than it
had been 40 years ago when the Gaza Strip was under the Egyptian administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Za'anoun pointed out that Palestinian courts and jurists were being
harassed by some junior officers in the PA security agencies, adding that in contrast a
single judge of the Israeli High Court was able to prevent the Israeli Prime Minister from
closing down Orient House a few weeks ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I am ashamed of what is going on in our justice system,&quot; said
Za'anoun, with bitterness clear in the tone of his voice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He wished well for the newly appointed Attorney-General Zuheir Surani and
President of the High Court Radwan al Agha saying, &quot;I hope you will not be afraid; I
also hope they will not face what their predecessors had faced.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(The former A-G Fayez Abu Rahma and former High Court President Qusay
Abadleh resigned a year and a half ago after the PA executive authority refused to carry
out court decisions to release political prisoners who had been incarcerated for prolonged
periods without charge or trial.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, Za'anoun castigated the PA for ignoring the decisions and
recommendations of the Legislative Council (PLC) and the Palestine National Council (PNC),
saying the PLC made tremendous efforts in enacting new laws and legislation, and preparing
the Basic Law, only to be ignored by the executive authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;When the PLC prepared the Basic Law, the executive authority refused
it arguing that only the PNC and Central Council were qualified to promulgate a draft of
the Basic Law. However, when the two councils did just that, the executive authority said
nobody except the Arab league could be entrusted with preparing the Basic Law.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He warned that unless the PA put its own house in order, the Palestinians
wouldn't deserve a State and any amount of foreign and American aid wouldn't benefit the
Palestinian cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmed Qrei', speaker of the PLC, refrained from voicing direct criticisms
of Arafat. However, he warned that reverting to &quot;business as usual&quot; with the
Zionists while the expansion of Jewish settlements continued unabated and at a frantic
pace was a stupid and disastrous policy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;There is no way Palestinians can return to the negotiations table
with Israel while the Jewish bulldozer is pulverizing our land,&quot; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Never the less, it is all well-known that Qrei' and his PLC don't make
policy in the Palestinian Authority, hence his views to that effect shouldn't be treated
as much more than public recommendations to Arafat, the sole decision maker in the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ziad Abu Amre, a political science professor and a Legislative Council
member, accused Arafat's PA of killing Arafat's PLO.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The leadership that signed the Oslo Accords,&quot; he said,
&quot;did so in order to save the PLO from extinction and to put an end to attempts to
create an alternative leadership.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &quot;paradoxically, as we see it manifestly clear, it is
the PA that is killing, replacing and corroding the PLO.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The PLO,&quot; he argued, &quot;is in a state of gradual death and
there is no way it can be revived since it achieved none of the goals it was created to
achieve&#133;it failed its <i>raison d'�tre.</i>&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the economic level, most of the economic experts who took part in the
conference agreed that it was virtually impossible to develop a meaningful and prosperous
Palestinian national economy as long as &quot;everything remained in the hands of the
Israeli occupation.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hisham Oratani, Professor of Economics at the Najah University in Nablus,
called on Palestinians to have &quot;a moment of accountability with themselves&quot;
concerning the economic situations in the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that Israel was still in control of the Palestinian economy
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by virtue of controlling border crossings, taxes, the
labour market and all natural resources, including the land itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This economic subservience, he said, couldn't and wouldn't produce
political independence, adding that the Palestinian economic future looked very bleak,
indeed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA minister of Commerce and Industry, Maher Al Masri, agreed with
Oratani.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He imputed the current economic anarchy in the self-rule areas to the fact
that the Palestinians were in effect under the Israeli occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;As long as we don't have control over the land, there is no way the
Palestinian Authority can achieve real development.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He further predicted that it was becoming increasingly difficult to
rectify economic conditions in the occupied territories because the Palestinian issue
&quot;has reached the realm of the unknown since the expiry of the interim
agreement.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the third and final day of the conference, some speakers revisited some
of the topics raised in the plenary session, particularly those pertaining to the absence
of the rule of law under the PA and the failure of Yasser Arafat to bring about a genuine
separation of powers in the autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Azmi al-Shueibi, a PLC member, demanded that &quot;everybody, including
Arafat himself and the security agency, be under the law not above it.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Without fixing our justice system, nothing will work,&quot; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conference issued a final statement summing up its works, calling on
the PA to respect the sovereignty of the law, justice, accountability, transparency and
sound public administration, saying without these, there could be no meaningful
Palestinian State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement also demanded that there should be certain mechanisms
guaranteeing &quot;our people's right to exercise their inalienable rights on their
national soil to back up UN resolutions supporting these rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conference was another resonant vote of no-confidence in Yasser
Arafat's Authority at a time when the Palestinian public opinion began seriously drifting
away from the PA leadership and demanding political reform and genuine democracy. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA justice system in disarray</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> <i><b>From Khalid Amayreh</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has apparently taken some
promising steps toward the restoration of the rule of law within the autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This week, Arafat appointed Zuheir Surani, a veteran Gazan jurist and
lawyer of reportedly impeccable credentials, a new Attorney-General.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Surani, 63, succeeds Fayez Abu Rahma, who resigned from the
Attorney-General office he held a year and a half ago in protest against &quot;undue
interference&quot; in the administration of justice by the executive authority and the
refusal of PA security agencies to carry out court orders. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The appointment of Surani at the helm of the Palestinian judicial system
coincided with the appointment last week of Radwan al-Agha as Head of the PA High Court, a
post that had also been vacant for over 16 months due to the resignation of the former
chief judge Qusay al-Abadleh, virtually for the same reasons cited above. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian jurist community and human rights organizations have
generally lauded the two appointments as &quot;a step in the right direction.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Raji Surani (a cousin of the new A-G) said he hoped the two appointments
would deliver the Palestinian justice system from &quot;the catastrophic conditions&quot;
it is undergoing now.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Surani warned that the new A-G and Chief Judge would eventually
meet the same fate as that of their predecessors if the executive leadership, e.g. Arafat,
refuses to come to terms with the fact that the law is above everybody, including Arafat
himself and his generally undisciplined security agencies. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I am not sure if the new Attorney-General has received assurances
from Arafat that he will be empowered to establish the rule of law,&quot; said Raji Surani
of the Palestinian Independent Commission on Human Rights, adding with a skeptical whiff
in his voice that &quot;if he hasn't, then he won't make much of a difference.&quot; The
new A-G and the Chief Judge will face a justice system that is on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In mid-May, the Palestinian Bar Association (PBA) asked its members to
refrain from litigation for three days in order to show their displeasure with the
&quot;judicial paralysis,&quot; currently prevalent in the self-rule areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In one instance, the single judge assigned to serve over 120,000 citizens
in the city of Jenin in the northern West Bank had to shut down his office, telling a
multitude of awaiting litigants to go home &quot;because the court is closed until further
notice.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, the head of the Palestinian Bar Association, Abdul Rahim Abu
al-Naser, appealed to Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to take meaningful
steps to save the entire justice system from complete collapse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We are sending out an outcry to the officials to save the justice
system,&quot; said Naser in statements published in leading Palestinian newspapers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the flaws cited by Naser were the permeation of lawlessness in
society, the vacancy of the Attorney-General&#146;s Office for the second consecutive year
and the utter indifference with which the security apparatus view court rulings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, what Naser omitted to say was the fact that there was simply no
&quot;Palestinian law&quot; in operation in the autonomous enclaves since the so-called
Palestinian laws currently functioning in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are in fact a
confluence of Ottoman, British, Jordanian and Egyptian laws, in addition to the hundreds
of Israeli military orders, issued over the course of the past 30 years solely to serve
the interests of the Israeli occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, much of this legislation is no longer relevant and should
be defunct, since it was introduced to fit circumstances that are no longer pertinent. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Numerous obstacles to administration of justice</b></u><br>
Numerous manifestations underscore the judicial disarray, ranging from understaffed courts
and under-trained lawyers to widespread interference in the administration of justice by
the 15 or so security agencies answerable to PA President Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Rani Abdo, a Palestinian lawyer from Jenin, the security
agencies often act as a parallel &quot;judicial authority,&quot; effectively undermining
the credibility of the courts and seriously corroding public trust in the entire justice
system.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Many of the security chiefs don't understand the concept that the
authority of law is paramount and that nobody should be above the rule of law.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another lawyer, Saber al-Tawil, pointed out that &quot;the PA leadership
is not interested and certainly not serious about upholding the rule of law, since this
would seemingly be incompatible with the parochial interests of some influential
operatives in the executive authority.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tawil warned that if the present situation continued, the justice system
would collapse completely, and the Palestinian society would drift menacingly to anarchy
and chaos, eventually bringing about the downfall and collapse of the Palestinian
Authority itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that a growing number of Palestinians are abandoning the
courts in favour of other avenues, such as the traditional tribal forums where
&quot;justice&quot; is quick &quot;and without all these complications.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lawyers&#146; diagnoses of the justice system are by no means an
overstatement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the PA justice minister, Freih Abu Maddin, used very strong terms
to describe the dire state of affairs, saying the justice system was undergoing a
&quot;nakba&quot; or catastrophe.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The term &quot;nakba&quot; is normally reserved for describing the loss of
Palestine to Zionist Jews in 1948 and the consequent dispersion of Palestinians throughout
the region and the world.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat: Law of the Land</b></u><br>
Given that Arafat holds all the reins, controls all the money and takes all the decisions,
the chairman effectively is the law of the land in the guise of the Palestinian Authority,
either directly by issuing all sorts of &quot;presidential decrees&quot; or indirectly by
acquiescing to the mainly unlawful activities and behaviour of his senior and junior
security chiefs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In part, Arafat's &quot;judicial autocracy&quot; stems from the utter
contradiction and incompatibility between the need to meet the &quot;security
commitments&quot; he took it upon himself to carry out under the Oslo Accords, and later
under the more scandalous Wye River Memorandum on the one hand, and the requirements for
building a modern society where people's rights and liberties ought to be upheld
irrespective of any other considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, these fetters and crippling restrictions explain why
political detainees and prisoners of conscience are locked up in PA jails for periods
ranging from six months to four years (roughly the same period of time other Palestinian
&quot;administrative detainees&quot; would serve in an Israeli jail, virtually for the
same suspicious charges, e.g. active political opposition to the Oslo process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It must be made clear that the matter goes beyond planning and carrying
out acts of violence against Israeli targets to include &quot;all acts of incitement&quot;
against the Israeli occupation authorities. And, in the final analysis, it is the Israelis
who have the right to determine what constitutes &quot;incitement&quot; and decide whether
a given incitement is &quot;harmful&quot;, e.g. when it is carried out by Hamas, or
&quot;innocuous,&quot; or &quot;tolerable&quot; when it is carried out by Fatah. In the
former case, Arafat is expected, in accordance with the agreements and other secret and
tacit understandings, to lock up the practitioners of the harmful incitement, such as
Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, who has been locked up in a PA jail for over 16 months, without
charge or trial, simply because &quot;his detention is necessitated by the
agreements.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Does this mean that Arafat is acting at Israel's beck and call? The
continued detention of hundreds of political activists (without charge or trial) suggests
he is.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Never the less, the security agreements with Israel can't be blamed for
all PA actions and behaviour that contravene the letter and spirit of the existing laws.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, a recent case in Gaza, where a citizen of the Jabalya refugee
camp, Ayman Amasi, nearly lost his life as a result of the torture to which he was
subjected at a Gaza police lockup, sheds some light on the lawlessness permeating
throughout the PA enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amasi was arrested on 15 May by the Gaza Criminal Investigation Squad in
connection with a theft and rape crime he had allegedly committed six months earlier while
working in the Israeli Arab village of Tira.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amasi, who had been completely acquitted by an Israeli court after genetic
and blood tests found no connection between him and the crime alleged, was beaten
mercilessly on the head, resulting in a brain hemorrhage from which he is still
recuperating at Gaza's Shifa hospital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But why would the Gaza police re-arrest a Gazan citizen on charges and
crimes of which he was acquitted by an Israeli court? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Basem Eid, Director of the Palestinian Human Rights
Monitoring Group, Abdul Wahab Darawshe, a former Arab Knesset member, had telephoned his
friend Yasser Arafat and requested that Amasi be arrested and punished for &quot;his
crime&quot; at Tira.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat immediately acted on Darawshe's call, ordering his Gaza police
chief Gazai Jabali to apprehend and punish Amasi for the crime of which he was supposed to
be innocent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still worse, when Amasi maintained that he was innocent and his police
&quot;torturers/interrogators could not extract any confessions from him, they offered to
let him free in return for 5,000 Jordanian dinars, roughly US$ 7,000.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, when Amasi told the story to his visiting brother, which
eventually found its way to the media, the torturer got very furious with him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That fury found expression in a savage beating to all parts of
Amasi&#146;s body, especially the head, rendering him unconscious.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After Amasi was transferred to hospital half-dead, Jabali claimed in a
statement to the press that he had tried to commit suicide, a claim vehemently denied by
Amasi's family and human rights activists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One police officer at Jabali's office, who spoke off the record, commented
half-seriously that &quot;Amasi was punished enough for his crime, and that should satisfy
Darawshe.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amasi was released from the Shifa hospital on 1 June.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He is now appealing to international human rights organizations as well as
all &quot;those to whom justice means something&quot; to help him receive justice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Amasi story didn't end right there. Ghazi Hamed, Editor-in-chief of
the Gaza-based Islamist weekly, al Risala, was arrested last month for reporting on the
case and publishing testimonies, including an affidavit from Amasi's Israeli lawyer,
refuting Jabali's &quot;assertions&quot; that Amasi committed rape and theft in Tira.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked by this correspondent why he ordered the arrest of Hamed,
Jabali said Hamed &quot;was caught red-handed while he was committing a crime.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked what his crime was, Jabali said, &quot;He was caught falsifying
facts, disseminating lies and doubts about the credibility of the Palestinian justice
system as well as trying to protect a hideous criminal.&quot; </p>

are a farm for the Israeli economy</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- A high-ranking Palestinian Authority official dismissed the
Palestinian economy as &quot;not really an economy in the true sense of the word.&quot;<br>
Bassam al Shaka'a, a member of the PLO executive committee and mayor of the West Bank town
of Nablus, argued that the Palestinian economy is an economy based on providing certain
services.<br>
&quot;Our economy is seasonable, and depends on some buyers here and there and has no
relations with the real meaning of a modern economy.&quot;<br>
Al Shaka'a pointed out in an interview with the daily newspaper al Ayyam, published
Sunday, that the occupied territories imported all their needs from Israel, adding that
Palestinians couldn't either import or export because they don't control the borders.<br>
&quot;We only sell to them (the Israelis) when they need a certain commodity, and at a
very low price.&quot;<br>
He added that without having control over the borders, the Palestinian economy would
remain &quot;a farm for the Israeli economy.&quot;<br>
In 1994, the PA signed the &quot;Paris Agreement&quot; with Israel, which many experts
say, consolidated Israeli economic control of the Palestinians. </p>

justice system</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Palestinian National Council (PNC) speaker Salim al Za'anoun
has castigated Palestinian Authority President Yaser Arafat for corroding the Palestinian
justice system preventing a real separation of power.<br>
Za'anoun, a founder of Fatah, surprised the opening session of a conference at Bir Zeit
University on &quot;Palestine at a the Crossroads&quot; yesterday, lashed out at the
Palestinian leadership for the virtual absence of a separation of powers under the PA
regime.<br>
&quot;If we don't put our own house in order, do we really deserve a state? If there is no
separation of powers and protection of powers, and the foundations are no good, and then
nothing that we receive from the European Union will benefit us. If we are not our own
friends, then don't expect<br>
others to be our friends.&quot;<br>
Za'anoun pointed out that PA justice system is worse than the system which prevailed in
Gaza more than forty years ago when &quot;the courts at least had some credibility and
respect.&quot;<br>
He further said that Palestinian courts, the judges and jurists are insulted and
humiliated by the security agencies which are only answerable to Yaser Arafat.<br>
&quot;I feel ashamed, really ashamed because of this scandal.&quot;<br>
Finally, Za'anoun wished the newly-appointed attorney-General Zuheir Surani and High Court
President Radwan al Agha success in their new tasks.<br>
However, he said half-jokingly &quot;I hope Surani and al Agha will not be afraid to face
the same fate that their predecessor had met.&quot;<br>
The former A-G Fayez Abu Rahma as well as the former High Court President Qusay Abadleh
stepped down after the executive authority refused to carry out court orders to release
political detainees. </p>
