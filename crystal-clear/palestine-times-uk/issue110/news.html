Arafat likely to cave in to pressures</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khaled Amayreh</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was almost certain by <i>Palestine Times</i>&#146; press time that the
marathon talks between Israel and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would end in
failure. According to Palestinian sources familiar with the talks, little or no progress
has been made on any of the major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, the refugees
and the borders between the Zionist regime and a prospective Palestinian State.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We haven&#146;t reached agreement on any of the fundamental
issues including the status of Jerusalem and the refugees,&#148; said PLO representative
to the U.S., Hasan Abdul Rahman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that Israel was still refusing to come to terms with the United
Nations resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian issues which he said must be observed
and carried out if an agreement was to be reached at Camp David.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Rahman&#146;s downbeat mood was also echoed by Arafat&#146;s aide
and confidant in Gaza, al-Tay&#146;eb Abdul Rahim, who said in an interview on 24 July
with the PA-run radio, the Voice of Palestine, that Barak was essentially sticking to his
recalcitrant positions and seeking to evade international legitimacy.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The Palestinian delegation has achieved no progress on the
important issues of the negotiations, such as the status of Jerusalem, settlements, the
return of refugees and borders,&#148; he said in a speech at the Egyptian consulate in
Gaza on 23 July.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Rahim argued that the Palestinian delegation to the talks was
insisting that Israel would have to accept in principle at least the need for full Israeli
withdrawal to the borders of 4 June 1967 as well as come to terms with UN resolution 194
on the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that within these principles, the Palestinian leadership was
willing to show flexibility for the sake of reaching a just and durable peace with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian official did not elaborate on what he meant by
&#147;flexibility&#148; and whether, for example, Arafat would be willing to accept
Israeli annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza or the repatriation of
a symbolic number of Palestinian refugees as proposed by Israel and the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Zionist regime continued to leak reports about alleged
Israeli &#147;concessions&#148; to the Palestinians concerning the future status of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is amply clear that none of these concessions&#150;dubbed by
the Israeli media as &#147;painful&#148;, &#147;far-reaching&#148; and other similar
hyperbolic labels&#150;meet the minimum Palestinian demands, much less aspirations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, Israel has reportedly proposed to grant Palestinians a certain
degree of autonomy in a number of East Jerusalem&#146;s neighbourhoods and &#147;safe
passage&#148; to the Haram al-Sharif along with allowing the Palestinian Authority to
raise its flag atop al-Masjidul Aqsa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, the ultimate sovereignty and control would remain in the
Zionists&#146; hands, meaning Muslims would be able to worship at Islam&#146;s third
holiest shrine only in the shadow of Israeli guns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The United States&#150;the nominal honest broker who is also Israel&#146;s
strategic ally&#150;is effectively adopting Israel&#146;s positions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, before Clinton&#146;s sojourn to Japan, the Americans presented
to the Palestinians what was described as a &#147;bridging proposal&#148; on Jerusalem
that echoed Barak&#146;s position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The proposal, which was, at least ostensibly, rejected by Arafat,
suggested that the fate of the Old Town of Jerusalem be postponed for two years, while
Israel and the PA would have &#147;shared&#148; sovereignty over the two Arab
neighbourhoods in the interim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Americans reportedly told the two sides that they either have full
agreement or no agreement at all.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One American official compared the negotiations to pushing a rock up a
hill. If full agreement formally bringing an end to the 52-year-old conflict between
Israel and the Palestinians is not achieved, then whatever progress has been made on
various issues could be wiped out as the rock rolls back down the slope.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anxiety back home</b><br>
Meanwhile, the bulk of Palestinians at home and in the Diaspora continued to voice
mounting anxiety at the prospects of Arafat caving in to combined American and Zionist
pressure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 July, a group of prominent Palestinian leaders and figures, among
former delegates to the Madrid Peace Conference, in particular Dr. Haidar Abdul Shafi,
signed a petition that stresses the adherence of the Palestinian people to their
legitimate, national and inalienable rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition, addressed to the PA delegation at Camp David as well as to
the international and Arab public, demanded that any agreement that might be reached at
Camp David be subject to a Palestinian public referendum at home and abroad so that
Palestinians can determine their own destiny.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Signatories stressed that a just and lasting peace in the region would not
prevail without full Palestinian sovereignty over all territories within the 4 June 1967
borders, including East Jerusalem, the indispensable capital of the independent
Palestinian State as well as the full implementation of the right of return for the
refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition was added to a number of even more strongly-worded petitions
by Islamist and national forces, warning the Palestinian delegation in general, and even
Yasser Arafat directly, against compromising Palestinian rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Palestinian anxiety mounted considerably after it was rumoured
that only the issue of Jerusalem remained the main obstacle impeding the conclusion of an
agreement, which many Palestinians interpreted as a virtual sell-out of the refugees&#146;
right of return on Yasser Arafat&#146;s part.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some PA officials sought to dissipate reports to that effect, saying
Arafat was still committed to UN resolution 194.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, given the almost hermetic media blackout on the talks, and also
the scantiness of Arafat&#146;s reactions to Israeli and American leaks to that effect,
there seems to be no justification to give the Palestinian leader the benefit of the
doubt, at least for the time being.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Muslim authorities reiterate Islamic stance <br>
on Palestine, Jerusalem, refugees</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<strong>Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslim Ulema, or religious scholars, in Palestine have issued a series of
fatwas (Islamic edicts) prohibiting Muslims from conceding any part of Palestine and/or
al-Quds al-Sharif to the Zionists even under the rubric of a peace treaty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Ikreman Sabri, the Mufti of Jerusalem and the whole of Palestine,
issued a fatwa on 23 July, ruling that it would be haram (sinful) for Muslims in Palestine
to accept compensation or indemnification in return for their land which was seized by the
Zionists when the Jewish State was created in Palestine in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri said the fatwa was based on a similar decree by Islamic authorities
in the 1930s strictly forbidding any sale of the land of Palestine to Zionists.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Because all of Palestine is holy land, any acceptance of
compensation would be regarded as selling the land and that is inadmissible. Those who do
not want to return have no right to compensation, whatever their reasons,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Mufti opined that it was permissible for the refugees and
their descendants to receive compensation for their movable property and similar losses,
and also for their suffering.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The right of compensation should be linked and qualified.
Palestinian refugees have the right to return to their homeland and to get compensation
for their own suffering and that of their children and grandchildren,&#148; Sheikh Sabri
said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Saudi, Jordanian and Egyptian Ulema issued similar fatwas,
forbidding Muslims to give up land rights in Palestine in return for money, saying that
whoever willfully agrees to sell Muslim land to unbelievers would commit a grave sin
against God, his messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) and the community of
believers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 22 July, a group of Muslim Ulema in Palestine also issued a manifesto
rejecting the Camp David talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They called the talks at Camp David an exposed attempt to liquidate the
Palestinian cause, including the paramount issue of al-Quds al-Sharif and the equally
significant right of return of the refugees. The latter is enshrined in UN resolution 194,
which grants the estimated 4 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants
repatriation and restitution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The manifesto was signed by a group of prominent Islamic figures from the
West Bank, Gaza and what is now Israel, including Hamas founder and spiritual leader
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The manifesto declared the following: First, that Palestine in its
entirety is holy Muslim Wakf land and that no person, group, organization or State is
authorized to concede any part of its soil to the enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, that the estimated four million Palestinian refugees have an
absolute and inalienable right to return to their ancestral homeland and to their
villages, towns and homes from which they were expelled at gunpoint when Israel was
created in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Third, that whoever concedes on the right of return and accepts &#147;the
permanent settling of the refugees in the Diaspora, in return for compensation, or without
it, would be considered an outcast and enemy to Allah, his messenger, and the community of
believers. This is so, the manifesto said, because, the Prophet (peace and blessings be
upon him) said, &#147;Whoever transfers the possession of Muslim land to Kafirs
(unbelievers with whom Muslims are at war) will possess a resting place in hell.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fourth, that any agreement, pact or deal that concedes on Muslim rights
would be viewed as null and void, and that the Muslim Umma will not be bound by it,
neither in the present nor in the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The manifesto followed a massive rally by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, during
which Islamist leaders in Palestine reasserted their opposition to selling out Muslim
rights in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Addressing the rally in downtown Gaza, Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, the
number-two man in Hamas, declared that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would be
committing political suicide if he buckled under American pressure and accepted a
compromise on al-Quds and the refugees&#146; right of return.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We exhort the President to come back now, because nothing
positive could come out of this summit at Camp David.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rantisi warned Arafat that the Palestinian people will tear into pieces
any agreement with Israel that fails to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that neither Arafat nor the Palestinian people have any right to
give up even one atom of Palestine because &#147;Palestine and al-Masjidul Aqsa don&#146;t
belong to the Palestinians alone but to the whole Muslim world from Jakarta to
Casablanca.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Iran&#146;s supreme Islamic leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenai told
Islamic Jihad leader Ramdan Abdullah that any agreement between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority that lent recognition and legitimacy to the usurpation and arrogation of Muslim
rights in Palestine would be utterly rejected by Muslims all over the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdullah reportedly vowed that his organization will resist any
capitulatory agreement prejudicing Muslim rights in Palestine, particularly the right of
return and the restoration of al-Quds al-Sharif, the Muslims&#146; first Qibla (the
direction toward which Muslims turn their faces during prayer) and the third holiest
Islamic shrine, directly after Mecca and Medina. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Has Arafat surrendered to
American-Zionist dictates?</strong></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special to PT</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It seems increasingly clear that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat, the sole decision maker in the PA regime, is budging to American pressure on
virtually all the vital issues of the Palestine question.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to reports leaked from Camp David, where Arafat was said to have
been under virtual arrest, the Palestinian leader reportedly voiced a willingness to
retreat from the erstwhile declared Palestinian constants, which include the following: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- Full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- East Jerusalem must be the capital of a prospective Palestinian State</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- The fulfilment of the refugees right of return in conformity with UN
resolution 194</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- The dismantling of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, these &#147;constants&#148; represent the &#147;bottom
line&#148; of the position of the PLO, as they have repeatedly been confirmed and
reasserted, the last time during the PLO Central Council meeting early in June.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, these constants represent no more than a small part of the
Palestinian people&#146;s historical rights and give Israel the lion&#146;s share of
Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Reports from Camp David indicated that Arafat effectively budged on all
the above-mentioned constants.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On withdrawal to the 1967 borders, Arafat reportedly consented to the
annexation by Israel of major settlement blocks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And, as
it is known, there are now as many as 200 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip covering up to 40% of the former and 35% of the latter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This means that Arafat may have only settled for nearly 60% of the West
Bank and 65% of the Gaza Strip. If true, the Palestinian leader would be accepting the
Israeli stance which states that the West Bank and Gaza Strip were &#147;disputed
territories&#148;, rather than &#147;occupied territories&#148;, as enshrined in UN
resolutions 242 and 338.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And by agreeing to sidestep and effectively ignore the UN legitimacy,
Arafat would actually be caving in to Israeli intransigence at a time when the whole
international community urge for the implementation of all pertinent UN resolutions on the
Palestinian question. Hence, it is difficult to understand how Arafat could turn his back
to these resolutions when the whole world, including the United States, still consider
them the legal reference for any settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the reported Israeli offer to hand over up to 90% of
the West Bank to Arafat was just another tactical deception. Israel and the PA, as we all
know, don&#146;t agree on a common definition of what the West Bank is: For while the PA
considers the West Bank to include all the territories seized by Israel from Jordan, West
of the river, the Israeli government doesn&#146;t consider &#147;Greater Jerusalem&#148;
as part of the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And since Greater Jerusalem and the surrounding settlements make up
25%-30% of the West Bank, this means that Israel is offering Arafat only 90% of the 75% of
the West Bank. In other words, the Israeli offer would give the Palestinians in reality
less than 3,400 square kilometres of the 6,220 square kilometres that make up the total
land area of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, this would amount to less than 13% of historical
Palestine. Predictably, this would be viewed by most if not all Palestinians as a
disgraceful sell-out of Palestinian, Arab and Muslim rights, given the scandalous and
conspicuous obliquity whereby the Jews would get up to 87% where the Palestinians, the
indigenous people of the land, would only get the remaining13%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, Arafat, who always vowed he wouldn&#146;t give up even one
atom of East Jerusalem, seemed to be caving in on this issue of cardinal importance.
Reports from Camp David suggested that Arafat was willing, in principle at least, to
exclude the Armenian quarter and the so-called Jewish quarter in the Old Town, in addition
to the Al-Buraq Wall, which the Jews had transformed into the &#147;Wailing Wall&#148; and
later on to the &#147;Western Wall.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat&#146;s ostensible willingness to accommodate Zionist demands, by
accepting a certain compromise on Jerusalem, is particularly ominous. In fact, virtually
all Palestinians and Muslims view any concession on Jerusalem and the Aqsa Mosque as a
straightforward act of treason and treachery. In other words, it is unlikely that Arafat
would concede on Jerusalem and remain alive at the same time. Jerusalem is simply an
integral central part of the collective Palestinian, Arab and Muslim psychology, and any
submission to Zionist intransigence on the city would be inherently unacceptable to
Muslims around the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Arafat must be aware of the dangers inherent in conceding on
Jerusalem. He reportedly told President Clinton that &#147;I cannot concede on this
matter; they would kill me, and then you would have Sheikh Yassin to negotiate with.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another scandalous aspect of Arafat&#146;s negotiating position on
Jerusalem is the fact that he agreed to confine &#145;the bargaining&#148; to only East
Jerusalem. Arafat and his negotiating team reportedly made no mention of West Jerusalem,
70% of which is actually owned by Palestinians. Thus, no mention was made of the Arab
neighbourhoods of West Jerusalem, namely Talibiyya, Malha, Lifta, Ein Karem and Deir
Yassin, among others, which the Zionists took over and depopulated in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, Arafat has effectively retreated from his earlier red lines on
Jerusalem, a disgraceful act that would cost him dearly, sooner or later, unless he
reverts to Arab-Muslim consensus on this issue of utmost sensitivity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the settlement issue, Arafat has also budged to the Israeli dictates.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to some Palestinian sources close to the PA, Arafat readily
consented to an Israeli proposal whereby the Zionist regime would annex the bulk of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank. If true, Arafat would enable the Zionists to reap the
harvest of their occupation for the last 30 years. It would also ravage Arafat&#146;s
dream and that of the other marketers of the Oslo nightmare of seeing the settlements
re-populated by Palestinian refugees from the Diaspora.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, Arafat apparently agreed to virtually revoke the refugees&#146;
right of return. Palestinian sources at Camp David had pointed out that the issue of
Jerusalem remained the &#147;main obstacle to reaching a framework agreement with
Israel.&#148; In fact, one understands from this announcement that the two sides reached a
concordance on this issue, which either means that Israel agreed to carry out UN
resolution 194 and allow the refugees to return to their former homes in 1948 Palestine,
or that the Palestinian Authority agreed to simply forget about the right of return. If
true, this position by the leader of the PLO would amount to a blatant crime against the
refugees&#146; inalienable right to return to their former homes and villages from which
they were physically expelled at gunpoint by Zionist gangs in 1948. The outlook of this
crime is made even bleaker considering that the <i>raison d&#146;�tre</i> of the PLO was
to attain the right of return. The PLO was a refugees&#146; movement, and undoing the
right of return by the PLO leader would be a nightmarish paradox of incalculable
proportions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The right of return issue is in a certain sense even more crucial than the
issue of Jerusalem, since this right is personal and collective in nature and is also
inalienable and explicitly enshrined in resolution 194. And being so, the right of return
can&#146;t be canceled, negated, suspended or conceded by anybody, save by the very person
directly concerned, namely the individual refugee himself or herself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, Arafat and his hangers-on, such as Muhammad Dahlan, have been
trying for sometime to signal their willingness to concede on the refugees&#146; rights,
but without saying so publicly and openly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A couple of months ago, Dahlan, who is Chief of Preventive Security in
Gaza, reportedly told a refugee committee to forget about the right of refugees because
&#147;the bulk of the refugees don&#146;t want to return anyway and that Israel would
never accept the return of five million refugees.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This treacherous statement on the part of Dahlan, which observers believe
couldn&#146;t have been voiced without receiving a certain yellow or green light from
Arafat, is triggering deep and widespread indignation among Palestinians at large and
refugees in particular.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One refugee leader in Balata, near Nablus, on the West Bank gave a stern
warning to Arafat, advising him not to play with fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a sacred issue, and Arafat should stay away from it. He must
understand that if he concedes on the right of return, we&#146;ll kill him.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even some Fatah leaders, in particular Husam Khader of the Balata refugee
camp near Nablus, warned the PA leader that &#147;this is a red line&#148; and &#147;we
will not be bound by any agreement you sign that doesn&#146;t meet our aspirations and
rights.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, it seems that Arafat must realize that any &#147;peace&#148;
deal with Israel that doesn&#146;t achieve real liberation and freedom for the
Palestinians and doesn&#146;t enable millions of Palestinian refugees to return to their
homeland will be worthless and torn into pieces and shreds, and eventually buried with
Arafat when he dies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Palestinian Authority's tourism ministry
announced it would organize this summer a nudity contest under the rubric of a
&quot;beauty queen contest.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Semi-official Palestinian press today featured large advertisements to
that effect, inviting Palestinian girls to take part in the contest to register their
names from July 20 to August 10.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said the contest to choose Miss Palestine would
coincide with preparations to declare Palestinian statehood in September.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The newspaper al-Ayyam featured a topless girl in its add, emblazoned with
the phrase &quot;take part in the Miss Palestine contest now.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A spokesman for the organizers of the contest said the participants would
eventually be asked to wear &quot;swim suits&quot;, and would represent Palestine in the
Miss-World contest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked if he was worried about possible reactions from Islamic and
conservative circles who view this kind of activity as a form of promiscuity, the
spokesman said &quot;the PA will provide protection for our activities.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since its installment more than six years ago, Arafat's regime has sought
to encourage many negative western lifestyles, such as drinking of alcoholic beverages,
gambling, and even prostitution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron-</b> Scores of Palestinian youths and Jewish settlers clashed in
downtown Hebron on 23 July after some settlers stoned Palestinian cars travelling through
the Shuhada street.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said settlers sought to prevent Palestinian motorists
from using the main thoroughfare linking downtown with the rest of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers of Hebron are considered among the most extremist of all
settlers in the West Bank and they make no secret of their ultimate goal of obliterating
the Arab Muslim identity of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1994, a settler terrorist, Baruch Goldstein, murdered 29 Arab
worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque while praying at dawn at the Ibrahimi Mosque.</p>

as result of PA lawlessness</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tension swept over much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the first
fortnight of July following the killing of a Gazan woman by Israeli soldiers and the death
of two Palestinian boys in Hebron and Ramallah by explosive devices left over by the
Israeli army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 7 July, shortly after midnight, Israeli soldiers manning a garrison
outpost outside the Jewish settlement Kfar Darom in the southern part of the Gaza Strip
fired heavily at a civilian Palestinian car travelling on the Rafah-Gaza main road,
instantly killing 33-year-old I&#146;tidal Mua&#146;mar and seriously injuring her husband
and their two children. The cab driver was also moderately injured in the shooting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, an Israeli army spokesman sought to justify the shooting by
claiming that the military outpost came under fire, prompting the soldiers to return fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, later on, and after it became clear that the Israeli account of
the incident was concocted, the Israeli government apologized, though halfheartedly, to
the PA, admitting the soldiers made a mistake.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA officials and media described the killing as &#147;cold-blooded
murder&#148; and blamed it on &#147;the venomous anti-Palestinian incitement&#148; among
Israeli soldiers and settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA security officials in the area urged the Israeli government to remove
&#147;trigger-happy soldiers from the outpost&#148; and try the perpetrators for their
&#147;hideous crime.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Israel (as usual) effectively ignored PA complaints, as none of
the soldiers involved in the incident were transferred to another post, let alone
tried&#150;a characteristic pattern of Israeli behaviour under such circumstances.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians taking part in Mua&#146;mar&#146;s funeral called for
&#147;revenge&#148; and urged the Palestinian Authority to &#147;give us protection.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We must defend ourselves; we just can&#146;t accept this situation
where they shoot and we get killed...we must defend ourselves,&#148; said
Mua&#146;mar&#146;s brother during the funeral.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing of Mua&#146;mar was preceded by the death of two Palestinian
boys as a result of detonated munitions left over by the Israeli army: one in Yatta (near
Hebron) and the other in Beit Lukia (near Ramallah) on 5 and 6 July respectively.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sixteen-year-old Khalil Yousef Abu-A&#146;ram of Yatta was killed as he
stepped on an explosive device while grazing his flock near the village.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least three other Yatta boys were killed in similar circumstances in
the last three years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following day, another Palestinian high school student from the
village of Beit Lukia, situated near the former armistice line west of Ramallah, was also
killed when an explosive device detonated while he was working on his family&#146;s land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian villagers in the area accused Israeli settlers of deliberately
planting such devices in order to drive them into abandoning their land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As in Yatta, several boys and shepherds had been mutilated or killed by
explosions of this nature.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Israeli human rights group, B&#146;Tselem, 83 detonations
of abandoned explosive devices have taken place since 1987, resulting in the death of 33
Palestinians, among them 25 children, and the injury of 90 others, among them 69 children.
B&#146;Tselem also cited an incident in which one Jewish child from the settlement of
Ma&#146;ali Adumim was also killed as a result of an explosion of abandoned munitions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sona Al-Ra&#146;ee, Nasreen Taha, Suad Ghazal and Suad Abu Laban have

second-degree relatives and of obstructing visits by first-degree relatives by
intentionally delaying them for hours.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For her part, Abu Laban said that she was punished with solitary
confinement for several weeks while Taha said that she was threatened with handcuffing her
hands during the rest hours outside their cells because she tried once to rig up a shade
that protected them from the sun&#146;s heat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The prisoners said that they were regularly called offensive names and
mistreated by the jailers in addition to unnecessary searches of their rooms twice weekly,
which included confiscating their property.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They also charged the prison administration with preventing entry of any
new books and newspapers and of giving them lesser food rations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem-</strong> Zionist chief of staff General
Sha&#146;ul Mofaz warned against the possible abduction of Jewish soldiers from the
northern areas then taking them into Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mofaz underlined that it was difficult to completely close the borders and
that attempts to kidnap soldiers or civilians in the border area with Lebanon are a
possibility. He called on the Jewish settlers not to approach the border areas that were
not yet duly protected, though he affirmed that his army was intensively patrolling those
areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mofaz, who was speaking to inhabitants of the northern settlements, said
that those who throw stones at Israeli soldiers at the borders with Lebanon were
encouraged by Hizbullah, which was not interested in prevailing calm in the border area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that Lebanon would witness public elections in August and
Hizbullah was interested in increasing their political weight, so there was no need to
indulge in confrontations with it in that period.</p>

in Jordan rejecting refugees&#146; resettlement </strong></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Amman-</strong> Jordanian professional syndicates started a
campaign last month to collect two million signatures rejecting the resettlement of
Palestinian refugees in the diaspora and insisting on their right of return and
compensations at the same time.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Arab Al-Yawm</i> daily quoted Saleh Armouti, chief of the
syndicates&#146; council, as saying that the campaign would aim to mobilize popular
rejection of resettlement and compensation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He also pointed out that the council was discussing a proposal to organize
a popular march that would head to King Hussein Bridge, the link between Jordan and the
West Bank, demanding an endorsement of the refugees&#146; right of return and
compensation, in addition to condemning capitulation agreements with the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The council had issued a statement denouncing the Camp David talks and
affirming that the road towards liberating Palestine, including the issue of Jerusalem,
along with other occupied Arab lands was through the launching of Jihad and reviving armed
struggle by striking Zionist targets as well as American and Western economic interests in
the Arab region. </p>
