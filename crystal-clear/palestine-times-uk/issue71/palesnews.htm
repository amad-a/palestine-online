<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Torment in Surif</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Following
the discovery and arrests of the &quot;Surif Cell&quot; members, responsible
for a number of attacks against Israelis in the West Bank and Israel, including
the suicide bombing at a cafe in Tel Aviv on 21 March, the entire village
of Surif has been facing collective punishment. The village has approximately
15,000 residents. Collective punishment has taken the form of repeated violations
against the personal human rights of the villagers who have NOT been charged
or suspected with illegal activities. This is in addition to the demolition
of the &igrave;Surif Cell&icirc; family member homes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Curfews have been imposed on the village from 21 March
through 6 April and again from 16 through 21 April (during the Eid ul Adha
holiday). On 23 April, yet another home was demolished. The entire area
has been declared a closed military area up til the end of April, thus entering
and exiting from the village is prohibited. Journalists are also prevented
from entering. This has been the most brutal and lengthy curfew since the
signing of the Declaration of Principles in September 1993. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Strict curfew and beatings</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The curfew was interrupted every few days for two hours
to allow villagers to obtain food and water. According to testimony collected
by Bassem Eid of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, the interruptions
in the curfews did not allow the villagers enough time to obtain food supplies,
since all village entrances and exits were closed off by the IDF. Furthermore,
residents were beaten by border policemen in the streets as they rushed
to prepare for the re-imposition of the closure. Bilal Muhammed Arar, age
22, was attacked on 14 April during a break in the curfew. A jeep with three
border policemen on board stopped next to Arar and two other Palestinians.
The driver of the jeep got out and accused him of throwing stones. At the
time, there was no disturbance in the village. The policeman held Arar's
head between his legs, and beat him on his back with a helmet. Then four
other policemen spread him on the floor and began to hit him, claiming that
he was throwing stones. After being hit with a rifle butt, Arar lost consciousness
and woke up two hours later at the clinic in the village. The Red Cross
complained to the border police, and two soldiers will be tried for this
offense, according to Israel Radio.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ishak Ismail Ghneimat, age 19, left his house at 11:30
a.m. on 28 March to pray, in violation of the curfew. Ghneimat and other
villagers were attempting to assemble at the mosque. He was stopped by a
border police jeep and driven around the village for two hours while two
policemen beat him in the back of the jeep. Afterwards, the jeep went to
the school in the centre of the village and threw him on the ground. Another
border police jeep arrived and eight border policemen began hitting him.
Two and a half hours later, he was released, but not before being threatened
that if he leaves his house again, he will be run over by the police. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Denial of urgent medical care</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Residents were not allowed to leave even to seek urgent
medical treatment. A Jordanian tourist, Khalid Mustafa Arar, aged 61, who
was visiting relatives in the village, died after being denied exit to a
hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 14 April, Arar decided to end his visit and return to
Jordan. As he was leaving, he encountered a disturbance in progress and
fell unconscious from tear gas inhalation. Residents gathered around him
to provide first aid, and the soldiers fired more tear gas at the gathered
people, with the unconscious Arar in the centre. Residents tried to evacuate
him through the Beit Ummar checkpoint, but soldiers refused to let him pass.
The delay lasted for nearly two hours. After a lengthy argument, the residents
forced their way through the checkpoint. Arar died on the way to the hospital.
Gas inhalation caused his heart attack, although Arar might have been saved
if his evacuation was not delayed for so long.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In another instance, a pregnant woman approached the authorities
two days in a row, begging for permission to leave the village and give
birth in a hospital. On 10 April, Ifrikiya Ahmed Irnimat, age 18, called
for an ambulance since she was in labour. The village midwife examined her
and determined that she should be taken to the hospital, but the hospital
explained that the soldiers were preventing ambulances from entering the
village. On 11 April around 8 a.m., Irnimat tried to leave the village,
but the police turned her back. Again in the afternoon she tried to leave,
and this time she succeeded. However, after giving birth in the hospital,
the baby was born dead. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Complaints of brutality and violence</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The entry of the soldiers to the village was accompanied
by brutal and unnecessary violence and destruction of property. At least
60 homes were entered and private property destroyed by the soldiers. Hazem
Ghneimat, age 31, was arrested on 10 April at 7 a.m. Border policemen damaged
kitchenware in his house during their search and arrest. The police knocked
over a container of paint on the floor of another house. This onslaught
of violence included the destruction of rooftop water cisterns shot by soldiers
during disturbances in the village. Dozens of windows were shattered, and
the residents reported that border police shouted insults and obscenities
at them during the night through loudspeakers mounted on jeeps, and shock
grenades were detonated in narrow streets and alleys for the purpose of
disturbing and intimidating the residents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At least 45 villagers were arrested at the beginning of
the curfew and remained in detention after the members of the &quot;Surif
Cell&quot; were captured. Twelve of the detainees remained in administrative
detention without being charged of any crime or link to the Cell. The administrative
detention orders last for 2-6 months. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Denial of education to the children</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the imposition of the curfew, the children of Surif
were unable to attend school, losing four weeks of education. At the same
time, 60 teachers employed by the Surif schools, but living outside the
village, were unemployed as a result of the curfew. Seventy-two teachers
living in Surif and employed in other villages were unable to leave to tend
to their classrooms, thus denying hundreds of children outside Surif of
their teachers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The residents of Surif are furious because of the collective
punishment. During the intifada, the villagers suffered similar measures,
but largely as a result of participation in the mass uprising. This time,
the suspects wanted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority were apprehended,
and the measures taken against the rest of the village constitute illegal
violations of human rights.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendations</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The success of the Israeli army in arresting the Surif
Cell was a result of cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and the
Israeli security forces. The PHRMG has a problem with such security cooperation
(ostensibly aimed at upholding the law) being used to violate human rights
and international law. The destruction of houses, the use of violence and
extended curfews, the denial of medical treatment and of education, as well
as administrative detentions are all violations of human rights and international
law. We call on the Palestinian Authority to condition their cooperation
with Israel, on the assurance that human rights will be respected, and that
information provided will not be used to violate human rights and impose
collective punishment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel must understand that in the context of the ongoing
political process in which the Palestinians are partners in fighting &quot;terrorism,&quot;
that the imposition of collective punishment only creates more distrust
and hard feelings. Israel must cease the arrogant treatment of Palestinians,
and recognize that they are not the collective enemy that must be collectively
punished. We call on the international community to serve notice to Israel
that human rights violations are not justified by the need to fight &quot;terror&quot;,
especially not when that fight is being assisted in dramatic ways by the
Palestinian Authority. (This article is published by courtesy of The Palestinian

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+2>After 42 months in Israeli prisons </FONT></I></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Rantisi assails security cooperation between
the PA and Israel</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron- From: Mohammed Halaika</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A prominent leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
who was freed last month after spending more than 42 months in an Israeli
prison declared his opposition to any reconciliation with the Palestinian
self-rule authority. &quot;There is no common ground between Hamas and the
Palestinian Authority,&quot; said Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi from his home in
Khan Yunis refugee camp south of Gaza City.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Rantisi, who was the spokesman for the 400 Hamas deportees
in Southern Lebanon in 1992, criticized a decision made by the Hamas leadership
to participate in a national reconciliation conference between the main
Palestinian factions organized last February by the PA in Nablus in the
northern part of the West Bank. &quot;I would only agree to such a national
dialogue if its aim was to prevent bloodshed between Palestinians,&quot;
Dr. Rantisi said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Commenting on statements made by Chairman Arafat's adviser,
Nabil Abu Rediana, who denied security coordination between the PA and Israel,
Dr. Rantisi told the Palestine Times that coordination had not stopped.
&quot;The PA should release three Hamas activists from Surif who were accused
of kidnapping and murdering an Israeli soldier, Sharon Edri, if, as they
claim, security coordination had stopped,&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Asked whether the leakage of information to the Israelis
by the PA about the activities of the Hamas military wing has any impact
on the Palestinian national unity, Dr. Rantisi said that Hamas is the one
that always pays the price of national unity. &quot;Despite this fact, Hamas
will not direct its guns against any Palestinian because Zionists are its
only enemies,&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Rantisi, however, said that Hamas was keen not to push
the Palestinian Authority into the &quot;enemy's trench&quot; because the
Zionists will blackmail it and force it to give more relinquishments which
would only further harm the interests of the Palestinian people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Rantisi makes no secret of the possibility that he
could be arrested by the Israelis again even though he is living now in
a Palestinian self-rule area. &quot;The Israeli authorities arrested Sheikh
Hassan Yousef, a Hamas leader in the West Bank, when he was crossing the
bridge to perform his pilgrimage duty although he was living in Ramallah
which is also a Palestinian self-rule area,&quot; Dr. Rantisi said, adding
that occupation still exists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Remembering his last moments in prison, the Hamas leader
said that the Deputy Chief of the Israeli Bearsheba prison told him &quot;leave,
your detention is over, but do not force us to arrest you again.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He expressed concern over the fate and living conditions
of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. &quot;They are sad and disappointed
because Palestinian officials do not give priority to their problem.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Rantisi had founded, with Sheikh Ahmad Yaseen, the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in late 1987, one week after the eruption
of the Palestinian uprising (Intifada).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1988, he was put in administrative detention (without
trial) for 30 months on the charge of leading Hamas. He was released in
1990 but arrested again and remained in administrative detention for 12
months. On 17 December 1992, he was also arrested but this time to be deported
with more than 400 Hamas leaders and activists to Marjel Zuhour in Southern
Lebanon. When Israel allowed the deportees to return home in 1993, he was
arrested before reaching his home. On 20 April and after 42 months of detention
in various Israeli prisons, he was released. Rantisi, 50, is a podiatrist
and a lecturer in the Islamic University of Gaza<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas leader calls on Palestinians to escalate
uprising</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>against Israeli occupation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-The head of the political bureau of
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Khalid Misha'al called on the Palestinian
people in the occupied territories to escalate their popular uprising in
order to confront Israeli occupation and settlement policies. He also vowed
to continue Hamas' armed struggle against Zionist occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Misha'al said in a letter he addressed to the Palestinians
under occupation that the Palestinian question is now at a cross-roads.
&quot;The question is either to continue our Jihad and resistance against
Zionist plans by escalating our popular intifada which has spread to all
Palestinian cities, villages, and camps or to enter into an endless circle
of negotiations,&quot; the Hamas leader added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The (Israeli) enemy is establishing its aggressive
entity and completely overrunning our land and holy places amid international
silence, while America, in collaboration with Israel, is benefiting from
the so-called peace settlement which crushed the rights and hopes of our
people and legalized the usurpation of Palestinian land. It also allowed
the enemy to complete usurping the parts it was not able to seize by force.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Misha'al stressed the importance of National Unity adding
that after 50 years of suffering under Israeli occupation &quot;our people
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have started a new blessed intifada: a rebellion
that has dissipated the enemy's delusions, ruined its plans to liquidate
the people's cause and halted its malignant growth.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hamas leader said that unity among the Palestinian
people should be based upon resisting and facing the Zionists. &quot;The
uniting with Palestinians in diaspora completes the circle of resistance
and supports our people in the West Bank and Gaza,&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Palestinian people have succeeded in maintaining
their unity by God&iacute;s grace and by the wisdom and awareness of Hamas
and other resistance factions who prefer being patient rather than waging
a civil war among Palestinians.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hamas political leader emphasized that the &quot;experience
obliged our people to continue their Jihad and their resistance and to reject
all promises of a divided homeland that would realize the interests of Israel
and achieve its security.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The events proved that the Zionist enemy only understands
the language of force. Therefore, Hamas will continue with its Jihad and
its members will keep on fueling the fire of the popular revolution.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Misha'al accused the Palestinian Authority of attempting
to abort the new intifada.&quot;Neither did they make an effort to close
the tunnel under al Aqsa Mosque nor did they try to stop the settlement
in Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; he said.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas Boycotts Dialogue Session; Israeli
Repression Continues</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem: PT- By: Khalid Amayreh </FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority efforts to co-opt and rally the Islamist
opposition behind Chairman Yasser Arafat suffered a serious set-back on
28 April when Hamas boycotted a follow-up national dialogue session in Nablus.
It is still unclear why the main Palestinian Islamist opposition organization
chose to stay away since earlier indications had prognosticated the movement's
active participation. A popular Islamist leader from the Hebron area told
the Palestine Times (PT) on 29 April that Hamas was &quot;increasingly discovering
that Arafat is not really serious about conducting a meaningful dialogue
with the opposition.&quot; The Islamist representative accused the PA leadership
of &quot;only seeking to reap propagandistic fruits&quot; from the dialogue.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jamal Mansur, a prominent Hamas leader from Nablus said
the PA reneged on the &quot;confidence-building measures&quot; which the
Palestinian leadership had promised to take following the preliminary national
dialogue session in Nablus nearly two months ago. The said measures reportedly
included, among other things, promised freedom for incarcerated Islamist
activists in PA custody. Mansur also hinted that the PA was trying to manipulate
the &quot;dialogue with Hamas&quot; as a means to regain some of its lost
popularity in the Palestinian Street.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to confidential Islamist sources, Hamas is increasingly
upset by Arafat's apparent willingness to resume full security and intelligence
cooperation with Israel. Hamas reportedly was furious at PA Preventive Security
Chief Jebril Rajoub for colluding with Israel in apprehending the so-called
&quot;Surif Cell&quot; which reportedly stood behind a series of attacks
on Israeli targets, including the suicidal bombing at a Tel Aviv coffee
shop several weeks ago on 21 March. According to Israeli sources, confidential
information passed on to the Israeli General Security Service, the Shabak,
by the Preventive Security facilitated the apprehension and arrest of a
dozen Hamas activists in Surif, 15 kilometres north-west of Hebron. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The small town itself has been under siege and intermittent
curfew for the past six weeks. Palestinian sources in Surif reached by the
Palestine Times spoke of Israeli soldiers routinely raiding Palestinian
homes during the night, beating people and causing incalculable damage to
house utensils and appliances. Human rights activist Basem Eid, who was
able to visit the town on 23 April, pointed out that the IDF was &quot;inflicting
severe collective punishment on the local population.&quot; Eid cited one
example of Israeli soldiers deliberately damaging as many as 130 water tanks
on rooftops in Surif, depriving the population of a readily-available water
supply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli draconian measures against Palestinians outside
the &quot;liberated&quot; towns found expression in the killing on 27 April
of 18-year-old Mahmud Abu Amiriyya in the nearby village of Kharas. Palestinian
sources pointed out that Abu Amiriyya was killed by a random bullet in the
head fired by an Israeli soldier whose jeep was stoned by village children.
Three additional youngsters were also injured in the incident. An Israeli
military spokesman admitted that Abu Amirriya &quot;may not have been involved
in the stoning,&quot; adding, rather laconically, that the matter was being
investigated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the village of Deir Samet, 20 kilometres to the south,
Israeli troops raided many homes on 27 April, arresting five people and
causing extensive damage to furniture. At least on one occasion, occupation
soldiers threw stun grenades into one home causing serious injury to an
elderly woman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meantime, Israeli soldiers manning roadblocks and
checkpoints intensified the practice of arresting Palestinians traveling
on West Bank roads. Palestinian sources told (PT) that as many as 30 Palestinians
were arrested at checkpoints and roadblocks and sent to the Meggido Detention
Centre without charge or trial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Isa Karakei, Head of the Prisoner's Club,
as many as 400 Palestinians were arrested by the Israelis during April.
Karakei said most detainees are subjected to intensive interrogation before
they are sent to Meggido where hundreds of Palestinians are kept as hostages
under the rubric of the so-called administrative detention. Human rights
organizations point out the utter illegality of the administrative detention
as detainees have no way of knowing when they will be freed since the Israeli
prison authorities routinely extend by six months the detention terms of
inmates.<BR>

infrastructure</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas assails PA for security cooperation
with Israel</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Israeli
security sources said that the Internal Security Service (Shin Bet) is investigating
alleged links between a Hamas cell, arrested last month in the West Bank
village of Surif, and a number of prominent activists of Ezzul Deen al Qassam
Brigades, a military wing of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, Shin Bet had arrested two
members of the cell suspected of having contacts with two military leaders
of al Qassam Brigades. The leaders were identified as Muhyel Deen Sharif
(known by the Israelis as Engineer No. 2, a reference to Yahya Ayyash who
was known as the Engineer) and Mohammed Dief, a Hamas military leader in
the Gaza Strip. Sharif and Dief are at the top of the Israeli security&iacute;s
most-wanted list of Hamas leaders. Until now, the security has failed to
identify their whereabouts believed to be somewhere in the West Bank or
Gaza.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Haaretz newspaper, Israeli sources accused
the Hamas cell in Surif of carrying out a series of attacks against Israeli
targets during the last two years which resulted in the killing of 11 Israelis
and wounding more than 60 others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli sources said that Shin Bet would reveal new
information about the Surif cell pointing out that the Palestinian Authority
had arrested four other members of the cell. They added that the Palestinian
security services had provided the Israeli Shin Bet with important information
which led to the discovery of the place where an Israeli soldier had been
buried in the village of Surif seven months before.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli sources alleged that questioning members of
the Hamas cell would lead to further arrests among Hamas members in the
West Bank, including the Palestinian self-rule areas. They also boasted
that the arrest of the cell aborted a series of attacks which were to be
carried out in the 1948-occupied Palestinian areas and against Jewish settlers
in the West Bank. The sources pointed out that Israeli security is preparing
for a widespread campaign to crack down on Hamas in the Hebron area, in
cooperation with the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 21 March, the Israeli occupation troops imposed a strict
curfew on Surif, which has a population of 13,000. They also arrested many
of the young people in the village. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the leader of the rightist Moledet movement,
Rahba'am Zaefi, called on the Israeli government to impose strict mass punishments
on Surif and even to &quot;remove it from the face of the earth&quot;. Yuli
Eldeshtine, Israeli Minister of Immigration (Israel B'aliya party), called
for expelling all residents of Surif.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In another instance, two brothers of Martyr Musa Ghneimat
of Surif said that Shin Bet interrogators have been savagely torturing them
since their arrest following the Tel Aviv bombing carried out by their brother.
Ghazi and Mohammed Ghneimat submitted a petition to the Israeli Supreme
Court saying that the Israeli interrogators were using all kinds of systematic
torture including &quot;violent shaking&quot; and keeping their hands and
legs tied for long periods. They requested the court to issue an order preventing
the interrogators from torturing them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli occupation authorities had arrested the parents
of Martyr Ghneimat, his wife, and four of his brothers on 21 March after
the Tel Aviv bombing. All of them, except Ghazi and Mohammed, were later
released.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two detainees complained that the Israeli interrogators
kept them naked for long periods in very cold rooms and prevented them from
sleeping or resting by playing loud music. They also complained of being
denied the right to see a lawyer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ghazi was allowed to see his lawyer only once, at Eshkelon
prison. The Israeli interrogators did not allow the lawyer to see her client
again. During that sole meeting with his lawyer, Ghazi told her that the
interrogators tried to force admissions from him and his brother about an
alleged relation with the suicide bombing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In another development, Andrie Rosenthal, an Israeli lawyer
and human rights activist, expressed his fears over the fate of his client
Ayman Qufaisha of Hebron who has been detained by Shin Bet since 5 April
on the charge of having links with the Surif Hamas cell. Appealing to the
Israeli Supreme Court, Rosenthal feared that his client might be tortured
by his interrogators</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli prosecutor replied that Ayman was suspected
of being the link between the Surif cell and the military leadership of
Hamas. He also accused Ayman of taking part in the attacks carried out by
the same cell since 1995, including last September's kidnapping and murder
of Sharon Edri, an Israeli soldier. He alleged that Shin Bet had a strong
foundation to assume that the Palestinian detainee was withholding important
information which, if revealed, would protect Israel and its people from
serious danger.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The court finally accepted the justifications of the Israeli
prosecutor to prevent Ayman from seeing his lawyer which would give the
Israeli interrogators more time to use violence to force information from
the prisoner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, in two separate communiqu&Egrave;s, the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and its military wing (Ezzul Deen al Qassam
Brigades) assailed the intelligence cooperation between the PA's security
services and the Israeli Shin Bet which led to the arrest of the Hamas military
cell in the West Bank last month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas accused the Palestinian Authority of misleading the
Palestinian people by threatening to halt security coordination with the
Israelis if construction was not stopped in the Abu Ghneim settlement. &quot;The
arrest of a number of 'our heroes' directly after the meeting between Chairman
Arafat, the Chief of the Zionist Shin Bet and a CIA official after the Tel
Aviv bombing was to Jerusalem &euml;a stab in the back' over which the PA's
officials are now lamenting. It was also a stab in the back to all Muslims,
Arabs and Palestinians who are staging an uprising and sacrificing everything
in order to defend Jerusalem,&quot; Hamas said. It condemned the &quot;suspicious
role&quot; of the U.S. Administration saying it has been directly involved
in suppressing the Palestinian people. &quot;Such a role is a dangerous
development that foreshadows extraordinary developments in the future,&quot;
the Islamic movement added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas called on the self-rule authority to release all
detainees at once and to stop security and intelligence cooperation with
the Zionists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the other hand, al Qassam Brigades described the arrest
of several Hamas activists by the PA and the help it offered to Israeli
occupation authorities to identify the burial place of the Israeli soldier
as &quot; a real crime&quot; against not only Hamas but also against all
Palestinian people. Al Qassam Brigades warned that they would not be &quot;scapegoats&quot;
for the breakdown of the &quot;so-called peace accords which resulted in
our people being lost and torn apart.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Qassam Brigades stressed that the &quot;shameful crime&quot;
committed by the PA would neither undermine its abilities nor stop its 'Jihad'.
It called on the political leadership of Hamas to suspend any contacts or
dialogues with the PA until the latter &quot;expiates its sins&quot; by
releasing detained Hamas supporters.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA's Security detains Palestine Times Correspondent</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>American Committee Protests PA Harassment
of Journalists</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- The New
York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has protested to Yasser
Arafat concerning recent Palestinian Authority police harassment of Palestinian
journalists in the Hebron area. On 11 April, CPJ informed Arafat that it
was &quot;deeply disturbed by the actions of a Palestinian police officer
responsible for inciting physical attacks against journalists covering Palestinian
demonstrations in Hebron.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Committee pointed out that Wasfi Abu Ayman, a force-17
member, publicly provoked a group of youngsters to attack 10 Palestinian
journalists whom he labeled &quot;collaborators&quot; with Israel. Furthermore,
the protest letter pointed out that both local and foreign correspondents
on the scene were subsequently pelted by a hail of stones thrown by the
youngsters in the crowd. Ayman also attacked an unidentified cameraman,
punching him in the head, and threatened to break the camera of Associated
Press correspondent Nasser Shoukhi.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CPJ argued that harassed journalists were targeted for
carrying out their professional duties. Such actions, the letter went on,
represented clear violations of the right to free expression guaranteed
by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United
Nations, and exacerbates an already dangerous situation for journalists
covering the clashes in the West Bank between Palestinian demonstrators
and the Israeli army.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Observers in the autonomous enclaves have cited growing
police intolerance and intimidation of the few remaining &quot;non-conformist&quot;
journalists who refuse &quot;to go with the flow.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 23 March, Preventive Security Chief, Jebril Rajoub,
ordered his men to briefly detain and interrogate Palestine Times Correspondent
Khalid Amayreh for &quot;distorting Rajoub's image and communicating inaccurate
information.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amayreh was questioned at the Preventive Security offices
in Dura, 10 miles south-west of Hebron, about a televised report he had
dispatched to the United Arab Emirates (Sharja Satellite Television) on
a meeting in Jerusalem between Israeli Intelligence Chief Amy Ayalon and
Rajoub and his Gaza counterpart Muhammed Dahlan. Rajoub accused Amayreh
of &quot;tendentious reporting&quot; when the Palestinian journalist reported
that &quot;Ayalon demanded that Rajoub and Dahlan immediately put Hamas
activists and leaders behind bars.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The following day, 24 March, Rajoub said on a phone-in
programme aired by &quot;Sawt Falastin&quot; (Voice of Palestine) that &quot;first
of all Khalid Amayreh is insane&quot; adding that &quot;we didn't arrest
the great &euml;munadel&iacute; or fighter for freedom (he used the words
sarcastically)...we just questioned him briefly concerning a big lie in
a television report he prepared for UAE television in which he said that
the Preventive Security was beginning to arrest Hamas leaders in Gaza.&quot;
Rajoub went on saying that &quot;we didn't do anything incompatible with
the law; we have to protect our national interests. Amayreh and others can
always write against Oslo.&quot; At the end of the tirade, the presenter,
seemingly mesmerized by Rajoub's words, said &quot;indeed, we have to protect
our national experiment and interests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Again, the CPJ wrote to Arafat about the incident. According
to the media law promulgated by the PA and signed by Arafat, &quot;no security
agency has the right to detain, arrest, question or interrogate journalists
on matters relating to their profession.&quot; <BR>

unveiled Israeli plans to expand Jewish settlements in occupied Arab East
Jerusalem and other parts including the Jordan Valley, and Ramallah in the

dunam is about 1,000 square metres) west of Betonia village near Ramallah.
He pointed out that while the attention of the international community and

planning to expand other Jewish settlements in the northern and eastern

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gaza-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The Palestinian Human
Rights Centre said more than 3,000 Palestinians and Arabs are still detained
in Israeli prisons under harsh conditions despite the peace accords signed
between the PA and the Israeli government. The centre added that only a
very limited number of detainees have been released since the signing of
the Oslo accords while many others have since been detained. The Palestinian
Centre accused the occupation authorities of escalating the arbitrary measures
against the Palestinian and Arab prisoners by imposing harsh restrictions
on visits from families and meetings with lawyers. &quot;These measures
are considered a violation of the 4th Geneva Convention regarding the protection
of civilian residents during war. Article 116 of the Convention states that
&igrave;any detainee should have the right to receive visitors regularly,
especially his relatives,&quot; the Centre pointed out, adding that such
measures &quot;weaken the trust between the Palestinians and Israelis which
was established by the peace process.&quot; The Centre warned that prisoners'
lives were endangered after the rulings by the Israeli Supreme Court which
allowed Shin Bet interrogators to use violence and torture against the detainees<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Quiet deportation- Israeli residency policy
in East Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Policy aims to create new demographic and
geographic reality </FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>B'Tselem is an Israeli independent, non-governmental
organization established in 1989 to monitor human rights violations in the
occupied territories. It publishes reports, conducts advocacy campaigns,
engages in public education and serves as a resource centre.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>ISRAELI RESIDENCY policies have caused the displacement
of thousands of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem and threaten thousands
more. The forced eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem is clearly
in breach of international human rights and humanitarian law. Beyond this,
however, is the acute human suffering of people who have moved out of East
Jerusalem - temporarily, they thought -for a variety of reasons (the following
are just some examples):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Study or work abroad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- The acute housing shortage for Palestinians in Jerusalem,
a result of deliberate Israeli policies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- The refusal by Israeli authorities to allow a &quot;non-Jerusalemite&quot;
spouse to dwell in the city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Normal population movement from the heart of a city to
its suburbs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>People belonging to any of these categories are at the
risk of loosing their right to &quot;residency&quot; in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This means that they may not enter their hometown, let
alone work in it, unless by special permit, and that they are no longer
entitled to social benefits, such as national insurance, child benefits,
pension and health insurance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It should be stressed that these policies affect a Palestinian
moving 50 yards north of the municipal boundaries, but not a Jewish Jerusalemite
moving to West Bank settlements in the vicinity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Such a person suffers no loss of freedom of movement, residency
rights or social benefits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What is frustrating to us as human rights activists is
that these grossly unjust and inhumane policies, which have already affected
thousands of Palestinians, and may affect tens of thousands more, are carried
out discreetly, through invisible, bureaucratic procedures backed by Israeli
laws and court decisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are no trucks, no weeping women and children dragged
by brutal soldiers, no physical violence- in other words, little for the
media to &quot;cover.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the actual effect resembles what the most extremist
political factions in Israel have advocated: large-scale displacement of
Palestinians which threatens to permanently alter the demographic character
of Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We believe that for these policies to be halted, public
opinion and decision makers, both in Israel and internationally, must be
made aware of them and the damage they cause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The goal of Israeli residency policy in East Jerusalem
is to reduce the number of Palestinians living in the city, and to create
a demographic and geographic reality that will preempt any future effort
to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some 170,000 Palestinians holding Israeli identity cards
reside in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For the past two years, Israel's Interior Ministry has
been revoking the residency rights of Palestinians in East Jerusalem who
at some stage of their lives lived outside the municipal borders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Consequently numerous Palestinians have been required to
leave their houses and families and move to areas outside the Green Line,
the demarcation line of Israel at the outset of the Arab-Israeli war.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is estimated that some 120,000 Palestinians (70 per
cent of the Palestinian population of the city) may lose their right to
live in Jerusalem because of this new Israeli policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the war, in contravention of international law,
Israel annexed East Jerusalem an area of 70 km2 in East Jerusalem, and applied
Israeli law in the annexed territory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Immediately after the war, Israel conducted a census in
East Jerusalem and granted the status of permanent resident to everyone
present in East Jerusalem at the time of the census. Israel also declared
that residents of East Jerusalem could receive Israeli citizenship upon
request, but for political reasons, most East Jerusalem Palestinians did
not request citizenship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel's Supreme Court held that the Entry into Israel
Law applies in determining the status of Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem,
and that the identity card issued to them is comparable to the permit to
permanently reside in Israel granted under that law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The court also held that when a permanent resident settles
outside Israel, the permanent residency status expires. &quot;Expiration&quot;
of the permit, contrary to revocation, leads to the loss of residency without
explanation and without any procedure that would enable the subject to appeal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The law stipulates that a person is considered to have
settled outside Israel if he or she remained abroad for more than seven
years, received a permit to permanently reside in another state, or became
a citizen of that state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Supreme Court held that residency may also be revoked
if other facts indicate that the individual settled outside of Israel even
where the period of residency outside Israel was less than seven years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By applying the Entry into Israel Law to residents of East
Jerusalem, Israel relates to them as immigrants, even though the families
involved have lived in the area for scores of years, and it was; Israel
who entered the area, and not vice versa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The legal status, described above, reflects only a small
part of the picture. The Interior Ministry uses unwritten criteria and unclear
procedures in revoking residency status. Human rights organizations and
attorneys have failed in their attempts to determine the applicable criteria
and procedures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ministry refuses to publish its criteria for issuing
or revoking residency permits, or data regarding the number of persons whose
residency has been revoked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Not only Palestinians who have moved abroad are threatened
by this policy. Over the years, many Palestinians have moved to neighbourhoods
and villages outside the Jerusalem municipality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This migration is the result of the following Israeli policies
designed to entrench Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Israel has greatly restricted Palestinians in residential
building, causing overcrowding due to the serious housing shortage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Prior to 1994, Israel rejected requests for family unification
submitted by Jerusalem Palestinian women on behalf of their spouses who
are not Jerusalemites.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli policy compelled these women to leave the city
in order to be with their husbands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>East Jerusalem Palestinians living outside the city borders
customarily went to the Interior Ministry's office in Jerusalem to renew
their exit permits, thereby restarting the seven-year counting period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Interior Ministry's policy had been that only a continuous
seven-year stay outside of Jerusalem would result in the loss of the right
of residency. In the past two years, however, Israel changed its policy
retroactively, and those who have not lived within the Jerusalem Municipality
continuously lose their right to live in the city, even if they lived outside
the city for less than seven years and even if they did not become permanent
residents or citizens of another country. Persons who require the services
of the Interior Ministry in a variety of matters, such as replacing an identity
card, registering a child, or receiving an identity card for the first time
at age 16, are required to provide documentary proof that they live in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Those unable to provide suitable documentation lose their
right to live in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This requirement is excessive and unduly severe, and serves
as an additional bureaucratic tool to reduce the number of Palestinians
holding Israeli identity cards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The requirement of proving residency in Jerusalem applies
both to Palestinians living in the United States and to those living in
Al Ram, which lies only a few kilometres from Jerusalem's municipal borders.
Since the residency status &quot;automatically expires,&quot; denial of
residency status occurs without a hearing, without explanation, without
any notice of the right to appeal, and without being informed that the policy
had changed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The authorities have also taken Jerusalem residency status
from East Jerusalem Palestinians who moved to the Jerusalem suburbs (which
are within the West Bank).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Loss of Jerusalem residency status has significant implications.
Residents of East Jerusalem are not subject to the military government,
as are residents of the rest of the occupied territories. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Those without Jerusalem residency status are not allowed
to enter freely and work in Israel, and require special permits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Loss of residency also results in the immediate cessation
of national insurance benefits and health insurance through Israeli sick
funds, as well as access to education and other benefits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli Supreme Court has approved the policies of
the Interior Ministry. Therefore, no domestic remedies are available to
the victims of these policies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the Interior Ministry does not publish its criteria
for revoking residency status, East Jerusalem's Palestinians are uncertain
about their status. Consequently, many do not utilise the services of the
Interior Ministry, fearing that their residency in Jerusalem will be questioned
and that they will be found not to be entitled to an Israeli identity card.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Within the next six months, the Interior Ministry intends
to replace the identity cards of all Israeli citizens and residents. Palestinian
residents of East Jerusalem will then have to go to the Interior Ministry,
where the clerks will check whether they are entitled to an Israeli identity
card.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to estimates, some 70 per cent of Jerusalem's
Palestinian residents are liable to lose their residency status.This would
have severe consequences in terms of this populations ability to enjoy civil
rights as well as economic and social benefits. In addition, Israeli residency
policies are liable to dramatically change the character of the City.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian teachers in West Bank end 18-day</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>strike under threats from PA security</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ramallah (West Bank)- Special to PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 23 April, West Bank teachers ended a strike against
the Palestinian Authority after Chairman Arafat authorized the release of
25 striking teachers and promised to offer the teachers a pay raise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A coordination committee of the striking teachers decided
to end the strike and return to work on 24 April ending an 18-day walk-out
which involved more than 18,000 teachers and kept more than 200,000 pupils
out of their schools.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian police allowed 15 of the detained striking
leaders in Ramallah out of prison to meet with their colleagues in order
to reach a settlement to end the strike&oacute;the first to be staged by
PA employees since Chairman Arafat came to power in the Palestinian territories
in 1994.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the police retained the identity cards of the
released leaders in order to return them to prison if they failed to convince
their followers to end the strike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sources of the strike committee said they had been promised
by the Chief of the Preventive Security Service in the West Bank, Colonel
Jibril Rujoub, that all detained teachers would be freed. But the sources
feared that a number of the detained teachers would remain in prison for
a further unlimited period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The coordination committee had accused the Palestinian
Minister of Education, Yasser Amr, of escalating the situation by issuing
an &quot;arbitrary decision to refer 19 Palestinian teachers to disciplinary
council&quot;. The teachers were later dismissed from their work after being
charged with committing violations and &quot;harming the public interests.&quot;
But the Minister reconsidered his decision by suspending their dismissal.
The coordination committee said the teachers were punished because of their
'distinctive' activities in the committee which defends the rights of more
than 20,000 teachers in PA schools in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The committee had called on the PA to dismiss Minister
Amr and his Under-Secretary Dr. Naem Abul Hummos for their role in the &quot;destruction
of education&quot; in the self-rule areas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA teachers in the West Bank earn about 250 Jordanian dinars
a month (about $350) while the monthly cost-of-living for an average Palestinian
family is estimated at $750, the committee says. The teachers sought a 200
per cent rise in salary, while the PA officials offered them only a 10 per
cent pay raise which was viewed by teachers as insufficient. They complained
that their salaries were lower than their contemporaries in other ministries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Teacher sources said that the teachers&iacute; leaders
agreed to end the strike under the threat from Palestinian police and education
ministry officials of further arrests and dismissals if they did not give
in.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The teachers denounced the corruption in the PA civil service.
&quot;Millions are being squandered on cellular phone bills for PA officials
and on their luxurious cars whereas the Education Ministry does not have
a budget to meet its operating expenses,&quot; a statement by the teachers
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The teachers had staged partial strikes during the past
few months calling for a salary increase of 200 per cent. But the PA only
agreed to increase their salaries by 10 per cent. The teachers also demanded
improvement of retirement rules and regulations. They said they were surprised
to know that instead of meeting their demands, the Education Minister had
dismissed 19 of their colleagues, hence their decision to strike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Naem Abul Hummos, Under-Secretary of the Education
Ministry, pointed out that the PA had taken over a totally destroyed infrastructure
which included the education sector. &quot;We need more than 1,200 classrooms
and 1,500 new teachers to accommodate the increasing number of Palestinian
pupils,&quot; Abul Hummos said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian official said his Ministry needs more than
$200 million a year to maintain its schools, an amount which is not available
now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Abul Hummos added that the PA spends about $450 million
a year on salaries for its employees besides $200 million spent on social
activities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the head of the education committee in the PA's
Legislative Council (parliament), Abbas Zaki, supported the teachers' demands
saying that the Council sees these demands as &quot;fair&quot; because of
the low wages the teachers receive. &quot;We live in a crisis as a result
of failing to assess our political and economic policies and as a result
of accepting a low-ceiling peace agreement with Israel,&icirc; Zaki added.<BR>

prisoners, of which 120 are children and 400 others are a combination of
the elderly and the sick. They are all distributed throughout 12 jails and
charged with patriotism to their country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli authorities have blatantly ignored international
laws governing human rights protection mechanisms and continue to systematically
torture their Palestinian prisoners whether or not an actual crime has been
committed. What is even more disturbing to people of conscience is the fact
that these atrocities are carried out under the guise of Israeli law and
approved not only by the ministerial committee for intelligence affairs
in 1994, but also by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The permission to use torture has resulted in the killing
of 114 prisoners, either directly by shooting or indirectly as a result
of various methods such as violent shaking, beatings, hangings, sleep deprivation
and the conscious decision to withhold medical treatment. The human rights
abuses by the Israelis go beyond physical torture; the prisoners are also
isolated from the outside world. This is accomplished by the constant relocation
of detainees from one prison to another causing family members great difficulties
in tracking down their imprisoned relatives. Even if the prisoner is successfully
located, the Israeli authorities impose strict visitation constraints which
limits visitors to first-degree family members (parents and wife), while
brothers, sisters and children are allowed only if they are under the age
of 16 or over the age of 40.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite the harsh conditions Palestinians endure in Israeli
jails, the high morale of the prisoners and amazing solidarity among them
(for instance, sit-ins and hunger strikes) has enabled them to procure some
of their human rights; they were able to improve the quality of their food
and to have a sick prisoner moved to a hospital to receive appropriate treatment.
Unfortunately, there were plenty of failures by their noble efforts which
cost some inmates their lives in the process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>17 April&oacute;the day of solidarity with the Palestinian
prisoners&oacute;brings back sad, yet bitter, memories of all those who
died behind bars and those whose sentences have made sure they will never
see the light of freedom again.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Purchase of Land in Israel</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Erik Paul</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Were it not so ludicrous, one might even laugh at the statement
made by Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon (remember
him&oacute;he was the Defense Minister during the massacre of thousands
of civilian Palestinians in the camps of Sabra and Shatilla in Lebanon during
1982) to the Knesset's Economic Committee. In a bid to prevent the purchase
of land by Palestinians in the state of Israel, Sharon said that real estate
purchases should be prevented especially when the potential buyers are foreigners
from &quot;hostile countries.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Imagine! Palestinians are trying to buy back land that
was taken from them by hook and by crook! And talk about Israel being the
only democracy in the Middle East! This is very impressive. Is it that all
men are created equal in Israel but some are more equal than others? Or
does democracy only pertain to Jews? Palestinians have sadly become less
than second-class citizens on their own land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And just what do we call the building of new Jewish settlements
in Arab East Jerusalem? Is this a form of Israeli legality and democracy?
Or is it simply that &quot;might is right&quot; and the Israelis once more
do just what they please regardless of the right or wrong of the matter?
Thus we have a passing of Arab lands into Jewish hands. Remember, Israel
is the monster that Frankenstein (the U.S.) created!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It has always been the error of Zionists to fail to recognize
the Palestinian's respect and love for their land. It is because of this
intense love that they die for their land and refuse to sell it in the Occupied
Territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Israelis have, through acquisition (in one
way or another), confiscated over 93% of Palestine with the exception of
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and even in these areas, there are established
Jewish settlements as well as an ongoing process to take more and more land
on a daily basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is strange how a Palestinian can be considered a &quot;foreigner&quot;
on his own land! It is even stranger to think that the real foreigners,
Jews who have infiltrated Palestine from Europe, Asia, Africa and yes, even
the United States, are considered the rightful owners of a land that never
belonged to them in the first place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The best example of what has happened in Palestine is the
analogy of a man living in his home somewhere in the world. The man built
that home with his own hands and accordingly loved it. Then along came a
stranger and at the point of a gun told the man to leave his home or else
he would die. The man either died or fled to save his life. His home became
the unlawful possession of the stranger who could never love it the same.
Can such an accomplishment ever be considered right? Who has more claim
to the home, the stranger or the homeowner who built and cared for his house?
Years later, the homeowner&iacute;s sons returned and tried to buy back
their father's home from the stranger only to be told that they were foreigners
and people from a hostile nation<BR>
