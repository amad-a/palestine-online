<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Hamas accuses PA and Israel of besmirching its
image</font></b><font SIZE="2"><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) accused the Palestinian Authority
and Israel of launching a smear campaign against the movement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The accusation followed a series of articles of unknown origin published
by the London-based journal <i>al-Watan al-Arabi</i> in early July and circulated in a
number of anti-Islamic papers in several Arab countries. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The articles, which were attributed to &#147;confidential sources within
Hamas&#148; alleged that there was a serious rift within the Islamist movement between the
&#147;Misha&#146;al faction&#148; and the &#147;Abu Marzuk faction&#148; and also hinted
that Hamas leaders embezzled millions of dollars. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the articles claimed that Hamas was seeking to dominate the
leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Jordan. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The publication of the said articles coincided with a vitriolic smear
campaign against Hamas in the PA newspapers in the self-rule areas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two journalists working for a PA Security agency, Muhammed Daraghmeh of
the daily <i>al-Ayyam</i>, and Tawfik Abu Khusa of <i>al-Hayatul Jadida</i>, wrote several
pieces in which they alleged that Hamas was undergoing a serious power struggle and even
claimed that the very survival of the movement was at stake. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas vehemently denied the accusations, describing them as
&#147;concocted, politically motivated, cowardly and completely and absolutely
baseless.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas official spokesman, Ibrahim Ghoshe, challenged the writers who
fabricated the articles to identify themselves and their sources, arguing that it was
likely that the writers were agents of the Palestinian Authority and the Zionist regime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These lies are motivated by hatred for Hamas and by a desire on the
part of sources of these lies to besmirch Hamas&#146; image and weaken the movement in the
service of the Zionist regime,&#148; Ghoshe was quoted as saying. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He argued that the &#147;mendacious information were disseminated by
suspicious agencies full of hatred for Hamas.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ismael Abu Shanab, an Islamist leader in the Gaza Strip, also dismissed
the articles as &#147;sheer fabrications and a propaganda war aimed at discrediting the
movement for its principled opposition of the Oslo process.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that the fabrications and concoctions were made by the same
people &#147;who are hounding Hamas and incarcerating its supporters,&#148; an obvious
allusion to Israel and Yasser Arafat&#146;s autonomous regime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Shanab stressed that the talk about embezzlements within Hamas was
&#147;absolutely untrue.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I challenged our accusers to produce a single piece of evidence
supporting their claims,&#148; he said. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Shanab, nevertheless, advised that &#147;we shouldn&#146;t give ample
attention to these fabrications, because Hamas is always targeted for defamation by its
numerous enemies.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 July, a leaflet believed to be distributed by Hamas in the Hebron
area renewed accusations against the PA and Israeli intelligence of &#147;spreading
disinformation about Hamas.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The corruption-ridden Palestinian Authority and the Zionist regime
are seeking to besmirch the name of Hamas because Hamas is the last line of defense in the
face of the ongoing conspiracy to liquidate the Palestinian cause,&#148; reported the
leaflet. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The leaflet said Hamas was as united as ever and even though differences
of opinion appear among the movement&#146;s leaders, they are settled through the Islamist
democratic institutions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The leaflet described the &#147;war of camps&#148; within Hamas, as
alleged in the articles, as &#147;malicious, sinister and absolutely and completely
without essence.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the leaflet challenged the PA to produce any evidence of any
financial irregularity of any kind within Hamas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Our people don&#146;t squander the people&#146;s money in the Tahuna
bars, nor on Russian girls, nor on building red-tiled villas and purchasing smart
cars,&#148; said the leaflet. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the leaflet pointed out that this was not the first time Hamas
was targeted by hostile intelligence agencies to besmirch its image in the vain hope that
this would weaken the movement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Hamas will continue to be a thorn in the side of all conspirators
and quislings whose treacherous deeds have become manifest to our people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA has refused to comment on the matter, but its two dailies (<i>al-Hayatul
Jadida </i>and <i>al-Ayyam</i>) featured prominently the accusations published in <i>al-Watan
al-Arabi</i>.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Israeli human rights group admits <br>
Israel is racist toward non-Jews</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Association of Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI),
a human rights organization monitoring the human and civil rights situation in Israel
proper, has charged that the Zionist regime adopts and employs &quot;racist standards and
measures against Israeli citizens who are not Jewish.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Association pointed out during a press conference in Jerusalem on 21
July that discrimination against non-Jews was ubiquitous, adding that the rights of
Palestinians, who are citizens of Israel, were grossly violated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;There is still discrimination between Israeli Arabs and Jews and the
rights of Palestinians are grossly violated.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to ACRI director Vered Livne, Israeli policy toward the issue of
human rights for non-Jews either stood still or even regressed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Livne said the worst human-rights violators were the Interior Ministry,
adding that many other ministries were also involved in institutionalized violation of the
human and civil rights of non-Jews, including the labour, social and defense ministries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">ACRI director, Prof. Yael Tamir, pointed out that over the last few years,
the Israeli interior ministry conducted a starkly discriminatory policy against non-Jews
in many fields, including family reunification, residency rights, marriage certificates
and the granting of citizenship.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tamir cited the ministry's policy toward Israeli Arabs who marry
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who, she said, are forced to live apart
from their spouses for many years because Israeli regulations don't encourage more
non-Jews to become Israeli citizens.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the most flagrant form of human rights violations that are
deliberately committed by the Israeli interior ministry took place in East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There, the ACRI said, thousands of residency rights were confiscated from
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This form of ethnic cleansing has so far victimized as many as 4,000
Palestinian citizens of Jerusalem, and human rights organizations and civil rights groups
admit there is no end in sight for that policy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the political level, confiscation of Jerusalemites' residency rights is
aimed at reducing the Arab population of the town to the absolute minimum.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources, Israeli interior ministry patrols
routinely scour the streets of Jerusalem, hounding Arab youths in an effort to strip them
of their identity cards and residency rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the bottom of this sinister policy and wicked practice is the racist
Jewish desire to make Jerusalem &quot;ultimately clean of Goyem,&quot; or non-Jews. The
policy of withdrawing residency rights from Palestinians is coupled with another
equally-sinister policy against the Arab population, that is the routine practice of home
demolition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel is extremely parsimonious in granting Arabs building licenses in
Jerusalem (for the above-cited reasons). This often forces Palestinians to build houses
without receiving a license beforehand, prompting the occupation authorities to send
bulldozers to demolish the houses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">ACRI chief legal counsel Dan Yakir emphasized the violation of human
rights in the Palestinian sector, including the widespread use of physical and
psychological torture and violence against Palestinian detainees by General Security
Service interrogators. Needless to say, the use of torture in Israel is officially
sanctioned by the law, making the Jewish State the only country all over the world to
accept torture as a legitimate means during questioning of suspects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yakir called on the new government of Ehud Barak to pass a law banning the
use of torture against detainees, saying the High Court should hand down a &quot;clear,
explicit ruling that torture is unacceptable.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yakir's call, however, is expected to fall on deaf ears whether in the
political or in the judicial establishment. The reason is simple: Israel is a
particularistic, racist Jewish State where non-Jews are treated as &quot;children of a
lesser God.&quot;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Arafat refuses to free Islamist internees lest he
upset Israel, CIA</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The continued illegal detention of hundreds of Palestinian citizens
without charge or trial by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian self-rule authority is still
poisoning the general political atmosphere in the occupied territories. The illegal
incarceration, for which there seems to be no end in sight, is not only taking a heavy
toll on the detainees' immediate families and relatives (who suffer most), but is leaving
indelible scars on the relations between the masses and the autonomous authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the adamant refusal by Arafat (the sole decision maker in the PA
regime) to release the political activists, or bring them before a court of law, allows
for no other assumption save that the Chairman is not answerable to his people<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> whose rights and freedoms he is supposed to safeguard and protect<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> but rather to Israeli and American intelligence services, which
insist that the Chairman violate his people&#146;s human and civil rights as &quot;a
price&quot; for continued American and Israeli backing for his &quot;police State without
a State.&quot; (Incidently, Arafat has always valued the legitimacy that comes from
international acceptance more than that which comes from his people's acceptance.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, it often seems that even Arafat himself is unable to free those
people, as the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) pointed out at a
Jerusalem press conference earlier in July. The PHRMG revealed that according to the Oslo
Accords and the Wye agreement, Arafat is demanded to act at the Israeli intelligence's
beck and call in matters pertaining to security, including the &quot;apprehension,
detention and punishment of people considered security risks.&quot; In other words, Arafat
must act as an additional, extraordinary or vicarious Israeli repressive arm against his
people. Unfortunately, this seems to be just what he has been doing.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Total number of &#147;hostages&#148; unknown</b></u><br>
The number of Islamist &#147;hostages&#148; (this is the term used by most Palestinians
within the autonomous enclaves to describe detainees) is not exactly known since Arafat's
various and often competing security agencies continue to &quot;round up&quot; new
detainees at Israel&#146;s instructions. (All the Israelis have to do is hand the PA a
list of names of individuals that ought to be placed behind bars.) Moreover, there are
full-time detainees, solitary-confinement detainees, part-time detainees, on-time/off-time
detainees, administrative detainees and so on. None the less, it is generally believed
that between 600-800 mostly Islamist detainees are interned in PA custody, the vast
majority of whom are detained indefinitely without knowing when they will be set free. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The inmates are kept in the former Israeli Military Authority jails in
Nablus (Jeneid), in Hebron (al-Imara), in Jericho (al-Mukata'a) and in three or four
prisons in Gaza. Indeed, the first impression one would get on visiting these symbols of
oppression is that the Israelis are still there, albeit with Palestinian faces and bearing
Palestinian names. One Islamist prisoner, Jamal Mansour, said that many detainees were
kept in the very same prison chamber they had served prison sentences in previous to the
conclusion of the Oslo Accords and the establishment of Yasser Arafat's PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The main difference between the Israeli occupation authorities and
Arafat's PA is that the former is wicked and sinister but smart and cunning while the
latter is almost equally brutal and harsh but stupid and brash.&quot; A wise enemy, he
said, is often better than a learned friend.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, in reality, PA security officials most often don't act as &quot;a
friend&quot;, particularly when they are put to the test. According to human rights
activists, PA interrogators use physical and psychological torture &quot;almost
routinely&quot; against Islamist detainees, usually for the purpose of extracting
confessions from them, but also as a means of &quot;reprisal for their (the detainees')
opposition to the Oslo process and Yasser Arafat's regime.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last year, Munir al-Hurub, a teacher from the town of Dura near Hebron who
has been interned by the PA for the last two and a half years, testified that PA
interrogators beat him mercilessly on all parts of his body, spit into his mouth, and
forced him to crawl for several hours a day. And when he called on God for mercy, an
interrogator would tell him that &quot;even if God were to come, he (the interrogator)
would put him behind bars.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, many PA security operatives routinely and habitually indulge
in &quot;cursing the Almighty,&quot; presumably in order to provoke the mostly religious
detainees. According to sources close to the detainees, this virulent practice is most
common in the Nablus jails, especially in the Jeneid Prison, which on 5 July witnessed
violent riots after prison officials began blaspheming God, the Prophet Muhammed, and
Islam. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Brutal force used against women and children</b></u><br>
In accordance with the above-cited adage &quot;a learned enemy is better than an ignorant
friend,&quot; PA police, including Preventive Security cadres and especially the so-called
Force-17 soldiers, violently dispersed a peaceful demonstration that the wives, mothers,
and children of the detainees staged to protest the continued detention of their loved
ones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to eyewitnesses, Force-17 crack soldiers pushed, dragged, and
even beat women and children outside the Jeneid prison &quot;without provocation,&quot;
prompting the protesters to call the soldiers &quot;collaborators, collaborators.&quot; An
undisclosed number of demonstrators were injured and taken to hospital. Moreover, Force-17
soldiers dragged and beat a Palestinian cameraman, Jafar Ishtaya, for &quot;filming an
illegal demonstration.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The demonstrators carried placards demanding an end to &quot;political
incarceration&quot; and the upholding of the rule of law.&quot; Moreover, the women
demonstrators released a leaflet castigating the PA for &quot;demanding the release of our
political prisoners from Israeli jails while the PA itself is interning its own people on
suspicion of resisting the Zionist occupiers.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, prison guards physically attacked Islamist inmates,
blaming them for the protests outside the prison premises and calling them &quot;dogs and
terrorists,&quot; the same labels used by Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 6 July, the PA police decided to impose further restrictions on the
detainees in the Jeneid prison, including depriving them of the daily furloughs (within
the prison compounds) and denying them family visits. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As of the writing of this report (23 July), the ban on family visits was
still continuing with no signs that it would be lifted soon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The brutal treatment of the demonstrators and the prisoners at the hands
of PA police galvanized the atmosphere in Nablus. Consequently, representatives of several
political factions in the town met with Mahmoud Al-Alul, the PA-appointed governor of the
town (no election has been allowed since the advent of the PA five years ago). The
delegation included Jamal Salim (Hamas), Taysir Khalid ( PFLP), Majid al-Masri, who is a
member of the Palestine National Council, as well as representatives from the Palestine
People's Party (PPP) and other local leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Alul denied that he ordered the police to use force against the
protesters, and suggested that the use of brutal force by the police was a mistake.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Alul indicated to the delegation that the issue of political
detainees was &quot;above me, and may even be above Arafat as well!&quot; </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maltreatment of demonstrators condemned</b></u><br>
The maltreatment of the demonstrators by the police received widespread condemnation by
the Legislative Council, student and professional unions, as well as human rights
organizations and civic groups.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The student council at the National Najah University in Nablus strongly
condemned the &quot;disgraceful behaviour of the police&quot;, which it said could
&quot;only be equated with Zionist repression against our people.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The council challenged the PA to &quot;point its guns toward the malignant
growth of settlement activities which are pulverizing our land and corroding our
aspirations for freedom, independence and Statehood.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muhammed Khader, the council's head, pointed out that the police were
acting as &quot;hoodlums and punks without any consideration for the fact that the
demonstrators were their people.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;It is a lamentable fact that Palestinian patriots are kept behind
bars while Zionist collaborators are at large,&quot; said Khader.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, Khader urged the PA leadership to take a brave decision to put an
end to political detention and to control the behaviour of its policemen who, he said,
were acting like enemy police. He also demanded that an immediate end be put to the
abusive, virulent and blasphemous language used by PA prison officials, which he said was
&quot;unethical and reflecting cheapness in the character of the users of this
language.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The &quot;Law Society&quot; also denounced the behaviour of the police
against the demonstrators and the detainees. In a statement issued on 7 July, the Society
demanded that the police refrain from using force, certainly excessive force, against
popular protests and demonstrations. The statement also urged the PA to bring those who
attacked the protesters to court, saying &quot;that nobody should be above the law.&quot; </p>

Jihad activism in the northern part of the West Bank. However, he challenged the Zionists
to bring him before a trial if they had any evidence against him, but to no avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, the Gaza-based <i>al-Istiklal</i> weekly spoke to Burhum in his
home in Tulkarm. The following are excerpts of the interview:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: After over six years of internment, how would you assess
this experience?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: Imprisonment is the antithesis of humanness; however, with
perseverance and resilience, a Muslim should be able to overcome the ordeals of the jail.
I see my internment in the context of the perpetual confrontation between the forces of
truth and the forces of evil. In fact, there is a continuous showdown, a continuous clash,
a continuous dichotomy between us and them. This entity (Israel) is inhuman, illegal and
immoral.<br>
Concerning the treatment I received, I could say it reflected and embodied the overall
policy of the Israeli military and intelligence establishment toward the Palestinian
people, especially toward the Islamist movement. That sinister and insidious policy is
aimed at demoralizing the Palestinians, breaking our will, and destroying our spirit.<br>
The internment conditions were difficult, particularly in the last weeks where I lived in
solitary confinement. But, again, this is the nature of the conflict with them, and they
can't be good towards us.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did they seek to bargain with you? Did they offer you anything?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: They constantly use one form of bargain or the other. During
interrogation, for example, they used to urge me to hand over &#147;written orders from
higher movement leaders&#148; and that in return they would get me freed. Then they
proposed to deport me for one year, but I absolutely rejected the principle of
deportation, even for three months. Then they proposed that I accept home arrest and talk
to no one, but I refused.<br>
Finally, they set conditions, namely that I renounce Jihad and organizations involved in
Jihad, declare publicly that I recognize their State, and distance myself from the Islamic
Jihad organization.<br>
I told them that I couldn't label Islamic groups that carry out Jihad as terrorist.
Terrorism and Jihad, I said, are diametrically opposed and can't be reconciled.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What charges did they level against you?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: They charged me with the following: That I am a leading member of
the Islamic Jihad organization in Palestine, particularly the military wing of the
movement, and that I possessed weapons. They employed all forms of physical and
psychological pressure to extract information from me. At one point, I lost consciousness.
Indeed, I was transferred three times to hospital as a result of torture. Among the evil
forms of torture they performed on me was the notorious shaking technique, beating on the
neck and throat, hooding, fettering, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: How could the prisoners stay in high spirits for a long time?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The prisoners are a blazing revolution, and despite all the
frustration outside, the prisons remain strongholds of patriotism and heroism. There is a
semi-daily confrontation between the prisoners and the Zionist authorities, which
necessitates popular backing. We must prop up those heroes by securing the needs of their
families.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: You warned you would begin an open-ended strike to protest your
incarceration?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: In truth, I had intended to do this, and my goal was not so much
for myself, but rather to contribute to putting an end to this evil practice, i.e.
political internment.<br>
I have spent 13 years of my life in Zionist jails during which I took part in six hunger
strikes, the longest of which lasted for 20 days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On this occasion, I would like to say that the solidarity put up with the
strikers often serves to shorten the duration of the strike, and that is good, as it
forces the Zionists to meet at least some of our demands.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do you think Israel will rescind the policy of administrative
internment?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: I don't believe so. However, I believe the Zionist regime is
seeking to enhance its ugly image by these propaganda cosmetics. We are essentially
talking about a racist and vindictive enemy that views non-Jews as &quot;less than full
humans.&quot; This racism on their part is at the heart of their maltreatment of us.<br>
Besides, I was arrested during the Labor Party government, which means that my release
(after six years) didn't signal any change of policy on the part of the Zionists.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What would you say to human rights organizations?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: I believe the Zionist regime should be tried before the whole
world. We must seek to expose this regime, especially its racist ideology and practice
against us. On this, I would also like to voice my anger at the fact that the Geneva
Conference was postponed indefinitely and prevented from saying the things it should have
said.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Finally, what would you say to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: More perseverance, more solidarity and unity, because the enemy
doesn't distinguish between us. </p>

undergo torture</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p></font>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Over eighty five per cent of Palestinian detainees in
Israeli jails under go various forms of physical and psychological torture, according to a
report released by the Israeli Human Rights organization known as B'etselem.<br>
The report said the vast majority of Palestinians rounded up by Israeli occupation troops
are subjected to forms of torture ranging from &quot;stiff psychological pressure to
genuine physical torture.&quot;<br>
Only 15% of the detainees, said the report, are not tortured, but even those are subject
to &quot;moderate psychological and physical pressures.&quot;<br>
Furthermore, the report pointed out that as many 1500 Palestinians detainees are
interrogated every year, the bulk of whom are members of Hamas and other Islamic
organizations opposed to the Zionist occupation of Palestine.<br>
Israel is the only country in the world where torture is officially sanctioned by the law.<br>
Scores of Palestinians lost their lives as a result of torture.<br>
Meanwhile, The Israeli press reported last month that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
would inform PA Chairman Yaser Arafat that he was going to release hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails.<br>
The sources said the Israeli government prepared a list of hundreds of names of prisoners
who would be released.<br>
The same sources said the list included Palestinian political activists who had carried
out &quot;normal security violations&quot; not involving killing of Israeli soldiers and
settlers.<br>
However, the sources said Barak wouldn't agree to free Palestinian prisoners &quot;who had
Jewish blood at their hands.&quot;<br>
If true, this stance would be in line with the policy of the former Israeli premier
Benyamin Netanyahu.<br>
This attitude on the part of the Israeli government is strongly rejected by the
Palestinians who argue that tens of thousands of Jews' hands are stained with Arab blood
and that &quot;Jewish blood is never redder than Arab blood.&quot; </p>

Aqsa Mosque</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Israeli occupation authorities
displayed a show of force in the vicinity of Jerusalem's al Aqsa Mosque ahead of a Jewish
religious anniversary.<br>
Israeli sources said more police reinforcements were deployed into the Old Town of
Jerusalem to forestall possible confrontations between Muslims and Jews following a
decision by the Zionist supreme court to allow members of an extremist Jewish group to
hold prayers in the plaza of the Haram al Sharif in Jerusalem.<br>
The extremists who belong to a terrorist group called &quot;the Temple Mount
Faithful&quot; plan to mark the annual anniversary of the destruction of the Jewish Temple
in 70 AD <br>
The extremists, supported by many segments of the Zionist establishment, advocate the
destruction of the Mosque to pave the way for the building of a Jewish temple in East
Jerusalem.<br>
On 21 July, the Israeli internal security minister Shlomo Ben Ami met with Faisal al
Husseini, and reportedly promised to &quot;deal constructively with this sensitive
issue.&quot;<br>
Ben Ami and Hussein also discussed the issue of Orient House, the unofficial PLO
headquarters in eastern Jerusalem. Following the meeting, Ben Ami admitted there was
&quot;a wide gap in our respective stances on Jerusalem.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several Jewish terrorist groups on 20 July, distributed leaflets in East
Jerusalem demanding the destruction of Islamic and Christian holy places in the town that
is holy to the followers of the three monotheistic religions.<br>
One leaflet in Hebrew read &quot;There is no meaning for a Jewish state without Jerusalem,
and there is no meaning for Jerusalem without the Temple of the Jew which necessitates the
demolition of all non Jewish buildings on the temple mount.&quot;<br>
The leaflets were signed by Kach, a Jewish terrorist group notorious of attacking
Christian and Muslim holy places.<br>
Jewish extremists also clashed on 20 July with Muslim youths outside the AL Aqsa Mosque.<br>
The clash took place when the extremists sought to forcibly enter the gates of the
Jerusalem&#146;s Haram al Sharif to mark the anniversary of the destruction of a Jewish
temple in 70 A.D.<br>
Meanwhile, Muslim Waqf authorities closed off the Haram al Sharif in the face of tourists
until further notice.<br>
The measure, said Waqf official Adnan al Husseini, was necessary in light of continued
provocation by Jewish extremists.</p>

arrest</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p></font>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Senior Hamas leader Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, who was
released last month after spending 16 months of internment without charge or trial in a PA
jail, said his punitive incarceration was ordered by Israel and the American Central
Intelligence Agency (the CIA).<br>
&quot;We all know that our authority (the PA) acts at the CIA&quot;s beck and call, hence
they heeded CIA and Israeli orders to intern me as a reprisal for my ideas.&quot;<br>
Rantisi said during the sixteen months he spent in PA detention, he was not accused of any
wrongdoing.<br>
And in response to a question on why the PA refused to set him free despite a ruling from
the PA high court to that effect, Rantisi said the PA was responsible to an authority that
is higher than the high court, an allusion to Israel and the CIA.<br>
Rantisi was released on 21 July ostensibly to pay his respects to his mother who died on
the same day.<br>
PA police chief in Gaza, Ghazi Jabali, didn't say if Rantisi would be returned to Jail
following the mourning period which lasts three days. <br>
Palestinian sources said the police kept the matter deliberately vague in order to keep
Rantisi guessing, a psychological tactic to force him to keep a low profile. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> A Palestinian detainee who is spending a jail
sentence for about 1,200 years in an Israeli jail continued to observe an open-ended
hunger strike for the fourth consecutive day to protest maltreatment and solitary
confinement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian jurist sources said Hasan Salameh, a Gazan freedom fighter
whom a Zionist court found guilty of planning martyrdom operations against Zionist targets
in 1996, has reportedly refused to take food until prison officials end his solitary
confinement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Palestinian Prisoners Society (PPS), Salameh&#146;s
health deteriorated substantially since he began his hunger strike on Wednesday, 14 July.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PPS called on human rights organizations to exert pressure on the
Zionist regime to allow a physician to visit Salameh in his Ramleh prison cell.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salameh was arrested in 1997 in Hebron in what seemed to be a joint
Israeli-PA operation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1999, Salameh was sentenced to 500 years in jail for causing the death
of scores of Israeli soldiers and settlers in a series of attacks in 1999.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, a report issued by the Palestinian Prisoner Club
revealed that the Palestinian political prisoners in the Zionist Talmund jail, north of
Palestine, were subjected to continued ill treatment by the prison guards. The report
added that the Zionist jailers used to break into the prisoners&#146; cells and spray them
with hot water. Several prisoners suffered burns, the report said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A letter sent to the Club by the prisoners said they were facing a
&#147;slow murder&#148;. They called on the human rights groups and the law organizations
to visit the prison and see for themselves their miserable conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian legal sources revealed that the Zionist interrogators would
not allow doctors to treat several ailing prisoners although their health situation was
deteriorating.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Club held the Zionist regime responsible for the serious living
conditions in the Israeli jails and for the escalation of inhuman practices against the
prisoners.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Leftists Seek to Form &#147;Third
Way&#148;</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> -<b> From Khalid Amayreh</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like other Leftists around the world, Palestinian Leftists suffered a
serious identity crisis after (and as the result of) the collapse of the former Soviet
Union, which more or less had been their ultimate role model.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That identity crisis is still enduring, and one of its conspicuous
features is the steady decline in the status and stature of the Left at the elite as well
as grass-root levels. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, opinion surveys in the West Bank and Gaza Strip put all
Palestinian Leftist groups combined at a distant third place (4%-5%) behind Fatah (the
mainstream faction of the PLO) and the Islamist group Hamas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even in student and other professional unions, the traditional strongholds
of Leftist activism, Leftist presence receded markedly, often giving way to Islamic
fundamentalist movements, primarily Hamas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This didn&#146;t mean that Leftists were making a dramatic turnabout from
the Marxist-Leninist ideology to political Islam. But it did mean rampant low morale and
an increasing sense of hopelessness and powerlessness coupled with a definite inability to
recruit new supporters, particularly among the younger generations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It also meant that many Leftist party activists, especially at the elite
level, were joining the increasingly swollen ranks of &#147;independents&#148; and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are active in promoting a civil society culture
and safeguarding human rights in a society that is still tormented by the Israeli
occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There is a general sense of weakness permeating in the Left. This
undermines its ability, even its inclination, to assert itself more forcefully on the
Palestinian arena,&#148; said Ghassan al-Khatib of the Jerusalem Center for Media and
Communications, adding that &#147;the Left is facing a crisis.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>Leftists explore &#147;Third Way&#148;</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Worried that their voice might &#147;get lost&#148; in the clamorous
rivalry between Hamas and Fatah, scores of Palestinian Leftist leaders and intellectuals
began lately exploring the possibility of forming what they described as the
&#147;Democratic Pole,&#148; or a Palestinian &#147;Third Way&#148; that would provide an
alternative to Fatah and Hamas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah is viewed as too corrupt and authoritarian to be entrusted with the
crucial task of building a civil society where the rule of law is paramount, while
Hamas&#146; ideology is inherently incompatible with the ideas and ideals of the Left. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(Interestingly, many Leftist figures occupy key posts in the PA regime,
including two ministerial posts.) </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>Meetings held to discuss &#147;Leftist unity&#148; theme</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, several exploratory meetings have taken place in Bethlehem,
Ramallah and Nablus during which representatives of the main Palestinian Leftist factions
vigorously, occasionally acrimoniously, discussed the theme of &#147;Leftist unity&#148;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These included the People&#146;s Party or PPP (formerly Communist), the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), FEDA, and the Populist Struggle Front (PSF). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Leftist sources, the participants stressed the need for
&#147;a broad democratic front&#148; encompassing all Leftist forces and independent but
secular-minded figures who believe in the &#147;democratic choice.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Democracy is not a resonant slogan we raise whenever we like;
democracy means genuine and complete personal, political, intellectual, social and
religious freedom,&#148; said Naji Salameh, chairman of the inter-partisan follow-up and
coordination committee which the participants authorized to prepare a work paper on the
subject. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salameh&#146;s almost libertarian tone, however, didn&#146;t seem in tune
with many erstwhile Palestinian Communists who still cling to such orthodox communist
concept as central democracy, class struggle, market economy and dialectical materialism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But that was only one of the many problems rendering the realization of a
true Leftist unity a distant goal, at least in current circumstances. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>Problems </strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Taysir Aruri, a member of the People&#146;s Party Politburo, alluded to
the numerous obstacles impeding the realization of Leftist political unity in the
Palestinian arena. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Speaking during a Bethlehem symposium entitled &#147;Search for a Third
Way&#148; last week, Aruri advised his colleagues to show &#147;piercing understanding of
the profound difficulties impeding unity among the forces of the Palestinian Left.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aruri didn&#146;t spell out these difficulties, but Ghassan al-Khatib,
also of the PPP, identified two sets of obstacles he said were seriously hindering the
realization of Leftist unity in the occupied territories. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, he said there were real political disagreements within the Left on
the peace process and the subject of Palestinian Statehood. For example, the PFLP
vehemently oppose the Oslo process, often dismissing it as a &#147;sell-out of Palestinian
rights,&#148; while FEDA (headed by PA culture and information minister Yasser Abed
Rubbu), and to a lesser extent the PPP, vigorously supported the process from its
inception. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khatib predicted that these real and potential disagreements might even
exacerbate, especially if the PA leadership was forced to give still more concessions to
Israel in the context of the final status settlement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Our political arena could experience widespread disintegration in
the coming months if the Palestinian leadership accepted the American-Israeli <i>fait
accompli</i>.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, there are real organizational and personal differences between
various factions and their leaders having to do with esteem and prestige, which Khatib
says will inhibit genuine movement toward unity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Added to that is the wide discrepancy in the Leftists&#146; respective
attitudes toward a host of other issues such as the role of the Palestinian working class,
globalization, pan-Arab nationalism, relations with Israeli Leftist groups and peace
movements. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>Left to form new political body</strong></u><br>
The Leftists&#146; endeavour to form a new political body, though a fledgling and even
uncertain, could very well revitalize the quest for genuine democracy in the self-rule
areas. Leftist leaders say their ultimate goal is to build a civil, democratic society in
which human rights and civil liberties are observed by the government in power. The Left
can be rest-assured that the bulk of the Palestinian people, including many Islamists,
share these lofty goals. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">None the less, the timing of this step, i.e. creating a new political
party, doesn&#146;t seem to be right. For political parties to function properly, much
less succeed, a modicum of normalcy and stability is needed. The Palestinians, including
the autonomous enclaves, are still, after all, in the throes of the Israeli occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> PA-financed newspapers in the West Bank
refrained from reporting or covering the big financial scandal in the Palestine National
Fund.<br>
The main PA papers made no mention of the embezzlement of $6.5 million by the erstwhile
president of the fund, Yasser Arafat's friend Jeweid al Ghusein.<br>
The Jerusalem-based daily, al Quds, was the only paper to report the grand embezzlement,
and even its coverage of the affair was often euphemistic and half-hearted.<br>
Al Ghusein, who resides in the United Arab Emerates, claimed he &quot;borrowed the money
with Yaser Arafat's consent.&quot;<br>
Palestinian sources close to the PLO have dismissed PA efforts to recover the money as
&quot;futile and pretentious.&quot;<br>
One source who asked that his name remain anonymous said &quot;embezzlement and outright
theft are the modus operandi of PLO finances, and Ghusein is only a little thief compared
to the others, some of whom occupy important posts at the helm of the PA.&quot;</p>
