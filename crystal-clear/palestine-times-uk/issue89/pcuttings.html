 The Middle East peace agreement gives the CIA a new and potentially
risky role in safeguarding security for Israel and the Palestinian
Authority. The pact empowers intelligence operatives to referee
disputes involving the handling of suspected terrorists, to monitor
who is arrested and jailed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities
and to help establish sophisticated and reliable border checkpoints.
While the CIA has quietly been performing many of these tasks
for the last three years, Friday's accord brings those covert
activities in from the cold and thrusts the CIA into the center
of the Middle East peace effort, making the CIA responsible for
monitoring and verifying the toughest provisions of the agreement.</FONT></P>

Settlers have threatened to work to topple Netanyahu's coalition
over withdrawal from the West Bank, holding angry demonstrations
for the last several days. &quot;We are not going to give up and
sit quiet,&quot; said Benny Kashriel, the mayor of Maale Adumim,
a settlement in the West Bank just east of Jerusalem. &quot;Netanyahu
told us he would stand strong against American pressure, and he
did not.&quot; Aharon Domb, a settler leader, was <BR>
even angrier, using language reminiscent of rhetoric used against
then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin before his 1995 assassination
by a Jewish extremist. &quot;The agreement emerging in Washington
is an agreement of betrayal of the ideal and the people who sent
Netanyahu to the head of the government,&quot; he told Israel
Radio.</FONT></P>

Binyamin Netanyahu denounced the Oslo agreement within days of
its signing in 1993 as &quot;an enormous lie&quot;. He was against
the peace process when he was in opposition, and twisted it once
he reached office. Since he became Israel's prime minister the
basic problem has been that Netanyahu, who alone could deliver
what was necessary for peace on the Israeli side, has not wished
to do so. During more than a week of frenetic and sometimes histrionic
negotiations in the United States, Netanyahu has not shifted from
his basic strategy, which is that the peace process as originally
envisaged should not and will not be carried through. There should
therefore be no illusions about the agreement which has been reached
in the Maryland hills, no talk of compromises and still less of
breakthroughs.</FONT></P>

Relations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, including
the personal relationship of Arafat and Sheikh Yassin, have seriously
deteriorated in the past year. When Sheikh Yassin was in prison,
and when he was freed a year ago, Arafat treated the Hamas leader
with great respect. Following his release, the Sheikh toured Arab
capitals and was given a king's welcome, arousing Arafat's jealousy.
During his visits to the Arab capitals, the Sheikh made disparaging
comments about the Palestinian leadership.. Two Hamas leaders,
Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi and Dr. Ibrahim Maqadmeh, were arrested
by Arafat's people and have been in jail ever since. They are
not alone. Dozens more (some say more than 100) Hamas activists
have been put in Palestinian prisons without trials. </FONT></P>

Netanyahu expressed concern that those who supports an agreement
despite the need to give up parts of the homeland and its attendant
dangers, would revolt to the point of refusing to serve in the
army when the next hostilities with the Palestinians flare up.
He added that &quot;the number of people who refuse to serve will
grow to an unprecedented size.&quot; At another meeting with the
settler leadership late on the Saturday before his departure,
Netanyahu said that if it is inevitable that the <BR>
government fall now, he would prefer that it be the right that
topples it rather than the left. He added that the public opinion
polls show that he has a good chance of being re-elected.</FONT></P>

Arafat, who has denounced Netanyahu for years, sent flowers for
the Israeli leader's birthday, but the two did not talk face to
face. After Netanyahu said he was considering leaving, Arafat
called him and appealed to keep the talks going and reach an agreement,
Palestinian officials said. Officials said the Israeli ultimatum
could have been just posturing designed to shake up the Palestinians
and Americans.  Just as important, Americans familiar with the
talks said, Netanyahu has to play to a small group of hard-liners
back home who demand that he snub Clinton and hold on to the remaining
portions of the West Bank.</FONT></P>
