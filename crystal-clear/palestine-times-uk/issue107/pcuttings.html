    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ehud Barak appears ready to make an historic breakthrough in the Middle
    East peace process by taking a first step towards officially recognising a Palestinian
    state. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli Prime Minister is reportedly preparing a resolution for his
    Cabinet which would offer the significant concession as long as Yassir Arafat, the
    Palestinian leader, abandoned his threats to declare unilaterally an independent state by
    September. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The offer, which is an attempt to breathe life back into the peace talks,
    would lead to recognition of Palestinian statehood if the newly created country was
    established in agreement with Israel. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak would likely run into trouble with right-wing elements in his
    Cabinet who would oppose such a plan. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Shin Bet security service has recommended to (Israeli) Prime Minister
    Ehud Barak that all prisoners identified with the Fatah organization and with other groups
    that are part of the Palestinian Authority be released as part of the negotiations with
    the PA.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The recommendation includes prisoners convicted of murdering or wounding
    Israelis. Apart from isolated cases, Israel has so far refrained from releasing
    Palestinian prisoners &quot;with Israeli blood on their hands&quot; within the framework
    of the Oslo process.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The position of the Shin Bet, as presented to Barak, draws no distinction
    between the prisoners on the basis of their actions, but only on the basis of their
    organizational affiliation. While the Shin Bet recommends the release of all the Fatah
    prisoners, irrespective of what they were convicted of, it also believes that all Hamas
    and Islamic Jihad prisoners should remain incarcerated until they finish serving their
    prison terms.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ain Helweh, Lebanon-</b> More than fifty years after Israel's birth, some
    70,000 stateless Palestinians remain behind the concrete walls of this refugee camp in
    southern Lebanon, living along muddy streets and warren-like alleys with no sure sense of
    where they, their children or their grandchildren will abide.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">If trouble starts after Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon this
    summer, local officials, diplomats and others say it is most likely to emanate from here,
    or from among the estimated 200,000 other Palestinian refugees, about 10,000 of them
    trained and armed, who live scattered across Lebanon in a dozen camps and several
    settlements where faith in the future has run low.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Washington</b>- ..Visiting the White House about a week after Israeli
    Prime Minister Ehud Barak was there, Arafat met in the late afternoon with Clinton after
    holding preliminary talks with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The first message the Clinton administration passed to Arafat was one the
    Palestinian leader clearly wanted to hear: US mediators will be more active than they have
    been in recent months in trying to shape the talks.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..But Washington's second message to Arafat was probably less welcome:
    that it is foolish to hold out for long-cherished goals and is instead time to cut a deal
    that both sides can live with, even if it falls far short of their aspirations.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jaba, West Bank-</b> Peace effort or no, it is still considered a badge of
    honor in Palestinian society to be a martyr for the cause. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">But no one ever expected Hilmiya al-Tous, mother of 12, to become one. She
    was not militant; she was not even political. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Her death on the night of March 20 got lost in a shuffle of momentous
    events. The next day, Israel withdrew from a sizable chunk of the West Bank and Pope John
    Paul II arrived in the Holy Land. It was Mother's Day in the Arab world, and Mrs. Tous was
    quietly buried by her children while her husband, Mahmoud, lay unconscious in a hospital
    bed. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. and Mrs. Tous were shot by an Israeli soldier or soldiers -- she in
    the head, he in the back -- as they were driving away from an Israeli checkpoint.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem</b>-Six days after the (Israeli) Supreme Court rejected the
    practice, (Israeli) Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday ordered new legislation that
    would allow Israel to hold enemy fighters as pawns to gain information on missing or
    captured Israeli soldiers. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">At the same time, Barak and his security Cabinet granted the release of 13
    of 15 Lebanese detainees whose case was the subject of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling
    last week. The men, most of whom have been held for more than a decade, some without
    charges, are due to go free today before the beginning of Passover at sundown. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..Barak said Israel must reserve the right to keep prisoners if doing so
    might provide information on Israeli soldiers who disappeared in battle. The proposed
    legislation would transfer the power of determining a detainee's fate from the courts to
    the executive branch, most likely the Defense Ministry--which Barak heads. </p>
