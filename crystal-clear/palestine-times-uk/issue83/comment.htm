<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Zionists! Your State Is Our Holocaust</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zionists! You are about to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of your misbegotten State, our holocaust. You know well, in your faithless
hearts, that you stole our land, raped our rights, and, by naked force,
drove us to the Four Corners of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Remember what you did to us. You built your homes on the
sites of our homes, you sought to erase our towns and villages, even the
names of these towns and villages you sought to obliterate so that they
won't haunt you anymore. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just remember--you built your evil entity by the sword,
through genocide, aggression and rape, so much so that you have become par
excellence the most notorious rapists since history began. For you raped
an entire country and a nation...at gunpoint!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Do you remember Deir Yassin, Kufre Kassem, Kibya, al Dawaymeh,
the Ibrahimi Mosque, Eyun Kara and Qana? If you forgot, we didn't, and never
shall we.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You are but modern-day Nazis. Outrageous? You know well
that it is not. Even Harry Truman, the executive founder of your brat, believed
so. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said &quot;that you are like all underdogs, when you
come on the top you become as merciless and murderous to your new victims
as your former oppressors were to you when you were underneath.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yes, you tormented us as the Nazis tormented you, for after
all you are the emulators of Hitler.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just take a look at your ideology, ingrained in your Talmud,
and you will see that it is not much different from Mien Kamph.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We will not count on your hearts, for they are as hard
as a flint stone; nor on your wisdom, for it is full of devilishness, slyness
and wickedness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, celebrate, for the time being; but remember that 50
years is a mere moment in an area where history is measured by centuries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Will your fate be any better than that of the Crusades?
I doubt it, for you are evil oppressors like them. You worship military
power, and lies are your ultimate armour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But you will eventually face your ultimate fate. Didn't
you face disaster twice in the past, because of your vanity and arrogance,
pushing you to slaughter your own children?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Your oppressive power won't last forever, because things
don't stay as they are. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But in the meanwhile, don't you even dream of &quot;peace&quot;
with us. How can peace be established between thieves and their victims?
At least the thieves would have to return the stolen goods.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Also remember that we Muslims are a stubborn people with
an enduring vigour and implacable determination, because we have the Qur'an,
the Book of God, which heralds the ultimate demise of your illegitimate
and immoral State:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;And we decreed for the Children of Israel in the
Scripture that you will verily work corruption and mischief in the earth
twice, and you will become great tyrants. So when the time for the first
of the two came, We roused against you slaves of ours of great might who
ravaged your country, and it was a threat fulfilled. Then We gave you once
again your turn against them, and We aided you with wealth and children
and made you more in soldiery. If you do good, you do good for your own
souls, and if you do evil, it is for them in like manner. So when the time
for the second of the judgments came, We roused against you others of our
slaves to ravage you and to enter the Temple even as they entered it the
first time, and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, celebrate, for the time being. </FONT></P>
