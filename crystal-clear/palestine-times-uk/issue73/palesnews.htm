<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish Groups Plan to Take Over Al Masjidul
Aqsa</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several messianic Jewish groups have been performing specific
rituals in advance of the &quot;re-establishment of the Third Holy Temple&quot;
at the site of Al Masjidul Aqsa in Jerusalem, Israeli sources revealed on
Friday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Hebrew daily, Ha'aretz, the leader of
one of these groups, Yehuda Itzioni, has been actively organizing &quot;exercises
and rehearsals&quot; on slaughtering sacrificial animals in preparation
for the &quot;rebuilding of the Holy Temple following the erasure of the
Al Aqsa Mosque.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1980, Itzioni was involved in a conspiracy to blow up
the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque along with several other terrorists
belonging to what was then labelled &quot;the Jewish Underground.&quot;
However, all the terrorists were given presidential pardon and subsequently
released, only to resume their diabolical plans against Islam's third holiest
shrine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ha'aretz pointed out that Itzioni and hundreds of his followers
slaughtered a ram recently at the Jewish settlement of Karmi Tsur in the
Hebron area. The ram was reportedly cut up into several pieces following
an ancient tradition attributed to custodians of the Temple's altar when
making their sacrificial offerings to the deity.The rituals were filmed
by the Canadian Television station (CTV) as part of a documentary on &quot;Extremist
Jewish Religious Trends in Israel.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to &quot;Ha'aretz&quot;, the rituals lasted for
three hours, without the slightest interference by the police. The film
included an interview with Itzioni during which he told CTV correspondent
in Israel Diana Lewis that &quot;the Aqsa Mosque is the wrong building in
the right place.&quot; Itzioni added that &quot;my followers are growing
in number on a daily basis, and that a large movement is now being crystallized
around the idea of the Jewish right in rebuilding the Temple.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A member of the group, who introduced herself as Banina,
said she believed that an imminent war would take place after which the
al Aqsa Mosque would be erased and the temple rebuilt. Indeed, most of the
Jewish groups associated with Religious Zionism believe that an internecine
war on an unheard-of scale (e.g. one that would leave tens of millions of
casualties) is a necessary precondition for the coming of the Messiah who
would save the Jewish people and bring about global Jewish domination or
Redemption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1980, a Jewish Underground member who was implicated
in planting bombs in the vicinity of Al Masjidul Aqsa told Israeli interrogators
that he thought the would-be-demolition of the Mosque would have infuriated
hundreds of millions of Muslims the world over. The terrorist added that
he reasoned Muslim rage would lead to a war which in all likelihood would
escalate into a world war in which the scale of casualties would be formidable
enough to promote the process of Redemption of the Jews and of the Land
of Israel. As all Muslims would by then disappear, everything would be ready
for the coming of the Messiah. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In March, a group of rabbis became euphoric following their
success in producing a &quot;completely red heifer&quot; at the Kfar Hasideem
settlement, the first of its kind in 3,000 years. The rabbis, some of whom
were seen examining the heifer skin using magnifying lenses, announced that
the ashes of the cow, when immolated, would bring about the perfect purification
of the sages, which then would herald the rebuilding of the Temple Mount.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Not Anecdotal</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is imperative to stress that these dangerous ideas are
by no means anecdotal in nature or confined to a small group of eccentric
believers. In fact they formulate both the very ideology of many hundreds
of thousands of Israelis, including most settlers, followers of the National
Religious Party (Mifdal), Gush Emunim, Kach, Kahane Hay, and perceivably
the gate-keepers of Israel's huge nuclear arsenal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In light of the above, the world, particularly Muslims,
should not be surprised if they wake up one day to the grim news of the
destruction of Al Aqsa Mosque at the hands of these dangerous terrorists
who pose an unparalleled menace to world peace.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli Piracy in Hebron</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Hebron- From: Khalid M. Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In line with its brutal maltreatment of Palestinians, the
Israeli army raided a farm in Hebron on 22 June, beating and arresting Nabil
al Natshe, 39, a local businessman and former deportee to Southern Lebanon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to eyewitnesses, two helicopter gunships hovered
over the farm located at the Singer outskirt within area (A) presumably
to photograph the farm. Soon afterwards, hundred of soldiers raided the
site and savagely beat up al Natshe, handcuffed him, and took him away to
an unknown destination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Natshe's son, 15 year-old Naim, said the &quot;criminal
soldiers beat up my father before our eyes, but we were helpless to do anything
because there were so many soldiers with so many guns.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Natshe's uncle, Issa, described the sudden raid and
the mistreatment of his nephew as &quot;an act of piracy and abduction that
is in line with characteristic Israeli savagery and brutality.&quot; Moreover,
Isa expressed profound bitterness at the Palestinian Authority's powerlessness
to stop Israeli terrorism against the Palestinians even within </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>areas which are supposedly under exclusive PA control.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You see, they (PA police) cannot do anything to stop
the Israelis...It seems they have carte blanche to do as they wish in our
'liberated' areas,&quot; said the 60-year-old man.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources pointed out that the operation, which
lasted for two hours, proceeded from the nearby settlement of Hagay on the
southern outskirts of Hebron opposite the farm. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hagay, like the tiny Jewish enclave in Hebron, has a few
Jewish families, but settler leaders hope to seize more Palestinian land
in the vicinity of the settlement for future expansion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Natshe was among the 415 Islamist deportees (deported
to Lebanon by Yitzhak Rabin in 1992). In 1996, he was detained without trial
by the Palestinian Authority and remained in custody for over a year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not known whether al Natshe's brutal arrest by the
Israeli army was carried out in connivance with the PA security apparatus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lately, the Israeli army resorted to abducting &quot;undesirable&quot;
Palestinians on the roads, at checkpoints or even in the streets. During
the month of June, Israeli soldiers abducted Sheikh Abdul Majid Atta, Imam
of the Dheishe Refugee Camp's mosque as he stepped out of the Wakf Department
building in Bethlehem. Atta's whereabouts are not known.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier in the month of June, two buses carrying Hebron
University students were &quot;abducted&quot; near the Beit Fajjar intersection,
13 miles north of Hebron. The buses and the passengers were held hostage
for several hours in the sizzling summer heat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eventually, the buses were let go only after several students
were taken to a detention camp ,without charge or trial.</FONT></P>

Movement, Hamas, condemned the decision approved this past June by a majority
in the U.S. Congress which recognized Jerusalem as the unified capital of

hostile attitude contradicting international laws and resolutions which
reject occupation and annexation of land by force.&quot; It added that the
decision provoked Arabs and Muslims all over the world. Hamas held the U.S.
government responsible for the consequences of this decision. &quot;Members
of the U.S. Congress who voted in favour of the decision have become hostages
of the Jewish Lobby. They are fighting for the interests of this Lobby rather
than for the real interests of the American People,&quot; it said, adding
that the U.S. decision would harm vital U.S. interests in the Islamic world.
&quot;It is a new blow against the (peace) settlement and those who support
it,&quot; Hamas concluded. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Bulk of Palestinians Believe PA is Corrupt</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat ordered an &quot;investigation&quot; into
the large-scale corruption scandal currently engulfing much of the PA administrative
apparatus. On 8 June, Arafat appointed a team of PA officials and associates,
headed by his personal secretary Al Tayyeb Abdul Rahim (merely a mouthpiece
for the Chairman), to investigate the Control Board report which spoke of
widespread financial corruption throughout the PA hierarchy and alleged
that as much as $340 million were squandered (roughly half the declared
PA 1996-1997 budget). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Abdul Rahim, the investigating team, which
he said has Arafat's full confidence, will meet with officials whose names
were cited in the Control Board report in order to establish the truth.
The ordered investigation, however, is expected neither to establish the
truth nor to convince a skeptical Palestinian public to place its trust
where it doesn't belong. The investigating team, after all, is largely made
up of people who are themselves part of the establishment and therefore
inherently inappropriate to carry out an objective investigation. More important,
many Palestinians already scoffed at the very act of ordering an official
inquiry into the massive scandal which a high-ranking finance ministry official
called &quot;the norm rather than exception.&quot; The official, who agreed
to speak to the Palestine Times on condition of anonymity, said Arafat knew
all along of and about all these &quot;excesses.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I can even dare say that the Chairman himself turned
a blind eye to at least some of the embezzled money,&quot; intimated the
official. If indeed the euphemistically worded &quot;excesses&quot; were
the &quot;norm&quot; rather than the &quot;exception,&quot; it would then
be fairly reasonable to conclude that the corruption scheme was so overwhelming
that any routine, even if well-intentioned, investigation would be utterly
inadequate to tackle the matter in any genuine manner. Added to that is
the fact that the investigating team (in order to carry out a thorough investigation)
would have to meet with (or more correctly confront) thousands of officials
and civil servants, not to mention the far more unbridled and inaccessible
security lords and countless VIPs who view any questioning of their &quot;credibility&quot;
as a common threat that ought to be repulsed at any cost. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 17 June, a public opinion survey conducted by the pro-PA
Nablus-based Research Center showed that 72% of the Palestinians believed
that corruption was rampant throughout the PA administrative apparatus.
Fifty-two per cent of the respondents actually opined that all PA ministers
be fired immediately. In fact, corruption within the PA seems to be &quot;very
well protected,&quot; using the words of a Ramallah municipal council official.
Recently, the head of a Hebron institution was told to stop inquiring about
an embezzled sum of money allocated for his institution because &quot;we
have here big whales and little fish, and you know what could happen to
the small fish if they don't behave carefully.&quot; Hearing this sombre
note from a central PA figure in Ramallah to whom he presented his grievances,
the Hebron manager decided to become &quot;pragmatic&quot; lest he be &quot;devoured&quot;
by a big whale or arrested on charges of &quot;endangering national interests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Kidra Fired</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Under heavy public pressure to produce &quot;action&quot;
rather than &quot;words,&quot; the Palestinian Authority did act on 4 June,
though belatedly, by sacking the ill-reputed Attorney-General Khalid Al
Kidra. Arafat fired his hand-picked AG reportedly after it became amply
clear that the latter had been involved in a series of serious violations
pertaining to his sensitive job, including charging bail, releasing prisoners
and pocketing the money without receipts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Kidra was reportedly placed under house arrest immediately
after he announced his &quot;resignation&quot; for bad health. Indeed, Palestinian
jurists and human rights activists, as well as many ordinary citizens, heaved
a sigh of relief at the dismissal of the widely-despised 70-year-old former
Fatah activist. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian officials intimated to the Palestine Times
on 9 June that Al Kidra had become &quot;an intolerable liability&quot;
to the PA and to Chairman Arafat. &quot;The man had become a stigma attached
to the judicial system and therefore he had to be removed,&quot; said a
PA Ministry of Justice official. On 5 June, the Palestinian Independent
Commission for Citizens' Rights issued a statement expressing profound satisfaction
at the sacking of Al Kidra. The statement, entitled &quot;Victory for Justice,&quot;
said the &quot;presence of this man at the top of this crucial office of
Attorney-General did an incalculable disservice to the Palestinian Authority
and the Palestinian people at large.&quot; The statement went on saying
that &quot;he always twisted the arm of the law, violated its letter and
spirit, made undue interference in court proceedings, concocted charges
against innocent people and, not the least, ignored and even defended human
rights violations by PA security agencies.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;All this,&quot; the statement concluded, &quot;made
him a premier obstacle impeding the administration of justice.&quot; Al
Kidra, who came to be hated by young Fatah activists for his &quot;excessive
hypocrisy and sycophancy&quot;, is particularly blamed for the deterioration
of press freedom and expression with the autonomous enclaves. In 1995, he
ordered the closure of the pro-Hamas weekly &quot;al Watan&quot; and its
sister publication, &quot;al Istiklal&quot;, of the Islamic Jihad. In both
cases, Al Kidra accused the two papers of &quot;incitement&quot; and of
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;endangering paramount Palestinian national interests.&quot;
Such nebulous and concocted charges were repeatedly evoked by Al Kidra to
justify the prolonged detention without charge or trial of journalists,
writers and human rights activists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I never felt that he ever tried to uphold the law,&quot;
said Ghazi Hamed, editor of the Gaza-based Islamist weekly, &quot;al Risala&quot;.
During the intifada, Al Kidra was shot in the leg by a disgruntled Fatah
activist following widespread rumours that he embezzled large sums of money
destined for young intifada activists. He has not fully recuperated from
that injury.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other critics opined that Al Kidra was the monkey rather
than the organ grinder. &quot;His main duty was to carry out Arafat's instructions
as well as please and appease the Chairman. Paradoxically, he ended up harming
his boss,&quot; said a clerk at the Gaza Municipal Council who expressed
satisfaction at Al Kidra's dismissal. &quot;The person 's gone, but the
phenomenon is still there,&quot; muttered the Gazan clerk, heaving a sigh
of ambivalence. The mixed feeling is rife among Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Sexual Gum</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the context of the ongoing propaganda war between the
PA and the Netanyahu government, Palestinian officials last week accused
Israel of spreading the so-called &quot;sexual gum&quot; among Palestinian
female teenagers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. According
to a PA Food and Drug Board report, Israel has been smuggling defective
and hazardous consumer products into the autonomous enclaves, including
the lust-arousing chewing gum which reportedly causes sexual arousal in
female teenagers and infertility to women of child-bearing years. The report,
published in major Arabic papers on 31 May, pointed out that seven brands
of the elastic substance were discovered in retail shops and roadside stands
in several Palestinian towns. Nahed al Nakhal, the Board director, said
some of the gum wrappers bear a warning saying &quot;not recommended for
girls below the age of 18,&quot; while other wrappers bear the phrase &quot;made
in Spain.&quot; Nakhal argued that it was highly unlikely the &quot;suspicious
product&quot; came from abroad, adding that the most likely source of the
gum was Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA official, who holds a Ph.D. in microbiology, pointed
out that Israel had always sought to &quot;dump all kinds of defective and
potentially dangerous consumer products into the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They seek to achieve two sinister goals: harming
our people and making money doing that,&quot; he said in an interview on
31 May with the Arabic daily, al Hayatul Jadida. Last year, samples of the
&quot;sexual gum&quot; were taken to Egypt for thorough analysis. The results
showed that the gum contained, among other things, the hormone progesterone,
a steroid hormone that induces sexual arousal in women. High levels of the
hormone, however, could cause infertility to married women.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian media treated the subject with ample attention,
warning young girls to be careful. Moreover, school principals were exhorted
to educate schoolgirls on the matter in the hope of increasing public awareness
of &quot;this cunning scheme.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Report on press freedom under PA </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>More human rights abuses</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The following is a comprehensive report by the Palestinian
Human Rights Monitoring Group ( PHRMG) on the status of press freedom under
the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression:
this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information
and ideas of all kinds regardless of frontiers either orally, in writing,
or in print in the form of art or through any other media of his choice.&quot;
(Article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Press and printing are free. Furthermore, freedom
of opinion should be entitled to every Palestinian individual who attends
the absolute right to express his opinion in a free manner either verbally,
in writing, photography, or drawing, as a different means of expression
and information.&quot; (Article 2 (1995) Palestinian Press Law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Palestinian Press Law, the right to a
free and independent press is guaranteed. This legal protection has not
been translated into the existence of a truly free and independent Palestinian
press. Our assessment of the status of freedom of the press and of expression
is that it is limited, often by bodies with no legal authority to do so-particularly
the security services and the President's office. This freedom is also limited
by the practice of self-censorship, practiced by journalists, editors and
publishers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To collect information for this report, the PHRMG interviewed
journalists and editors from three daily newspapers. Without exception,
those interviewed insisted on anonymity, stating the fear that their employers
will take measures against them, or that they will be harmed by security
agencies of the PA. This fear has a basis in fact: In 1996, Journalist Samir
Hamato was held in detention for seven months, without being charged or
interrogated. It remains unclear what prompted his arrest; Hamato himself
says that he has no idea what led to his lengthy detention, or what caused
his release. Hamato is a supporter of Hamas. In another case, Editor Maher
Al Alami, was detained for eight days for placing a story about Yasser Arafat
on page 8 of Al Quds newspaper instead of on the cover page, as requested
by the office of President Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Newspaper Closure</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Newspapers published by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad were
also closed in 1996, in the wake of the bomb attacks in Israel in February
and March of that year. A local newspaper, &quot;Jenin&quot; was shut down,
and its editor, Imad Abu Zahara, briefly jailed and threatened with further
imprisonment in October, 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The pro-Jordanian newspaper An Nahar closed on January
1. The immediate reason was for financial reasons. However, the PA had carried
out a lengthy campaign of harassment against An Nahar, resulting in distribution
difficulties and withdrawal of major advertisers, leading up to the financial
crisis. Two measures stand out: the closure of An Nahar for forty days in
August and September of 1994, was followed by a steep drop in advertising
revenue since both advertisers and readers AHD moved on to other newspapers,
and newsstand vendors were approached by individuals who &quot;recommended&quot;
that An-Nahar be &quot;displayed less prominently.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Harassment of Journalists</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the first three months of 1997, no senior journalist
was arrested. We have heard unverified reports of journalists in Gaza being
held by the security forces for one-way 'consultation&quot; during which
the journalists were told to &quot;behave.&quot; The reports are unverified
because none of them have been willing to cooperate with human rights groups
out of fear of reprisal from the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khalid Amayreh, a journalist with UAE Satellite Television,
gave testimony about his harassment, which is similar to the cases mentioned
above. On March 22, he was told to come to the PSS headquarters in Dura.
There, the officer in charge yelled at Amayreh, accusing him of suggesting
that Jibril Rajoub was taking orders from Ami Ayalon, head of the Israeli
General Security Service (Shabak). Amayreh had reported on a meeting held
between the two men, a meeting which was widely reported in local and international
media. After threatening him with imprisonment, the officer told Amayreh
to sign a document stating that there was no intent to &quot;libel anybody
or place someone in a bad light.&quot; The next day, two senior officials
of the PA attacked Amayreh on a Voice of Palestine program. The officials
were&quot; Mutawikil Taha (Director-General of the PA Ministry of Information)
and Jibril Rajub, who called Amayreh &quot;insane.&quot; Such comments intimidate
journalists, who fear being the target of official criticism and harassment.</FONT></P>

the last women prisoners from Israeli prisons (Feb. 11), a journalist was
pushed and threatened with arrest by members of Yasser Arafat's security
guard. Arafat invited a group of journalists to enter a room with him. A
security guard prevented the journalists from following. One of the journalist
told the guard, &quot;if you won't let me enter the room with Arafat, then
I am going home and there won't be a story.&quot; The guard then called
other guards to take the journalist aside. The guards took him aside, pushing
and behaving in a threatening manner. After the intervention of other journalists,
the situation was resolved peacefully. The incident is symptomatic of the
contempt many members of the security forces hold for journalists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When asked, most of our interviewees expressed the opinion
that arrests are no longer necessary, since the effect of past intimidation
has been successful in silencing criticism. In any case, journalists from
the three major newspapers stated that they are aware of &quot;red lines&quot;
that must be not be crossed for fear of reprisals from either management
or the security forces.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Official Cooperation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Three daily newspapers are published in PA: Al Quds, AL
Hayat al Jadia and al Ayyam. The situation of the daily press is an important
tool for the assessment of the freedom of the press. Despite its weakened
condition, the daily press remains the main channel for the distribution
of information and opinion. AlQuds is of special significance, as it is
the Palestinian &quot;newspaper of record.&quot; According to the JMCC,
public support for the three dailies is as follows: Al Quds: 52.6%, Al Ayyam:
8.6% and al Hayat al Jadida is 7.6%.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Various authorities practice censorship and unacceptable
intervention in the press. All of this intervention is in violation of the
press law quoted above, approved by Arafat in 1995. The authorities control
the content of the daily press through existing relationships with the owners,
publishers, and chief editors of the papers. This relationship is based
on outright ownership of a newspaper by senior PA officials, participation
of PA officials in senior positions on a newspaper staff, and in the case
of AL Quds, a close relationship between the chief editor and PSS head Jibril
Rajub.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The close connection between al Ayyam and al Hayat al Jadia
and the PA seems to allow those publications more latitude and freedom to
criticize than AL Quds. It seems as though newspapers openly connected to
the PA are seen as loyal, and therefore permitted to criticize-within certain
limits of course. Al Quds on the other hand, as the most veteran and respected
newspaper, must be restrained since its relationship with the PA is based
more on intimidation than on a close and voluntary relationship with the
authorities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Quds newspaper: PSS chief Jibril Rajub is in near daily
contact with al Quds chief editor. The two men apparently coordinate with
articles appear on the front page, and discuss the contents of stories that
are critical of the PA, or one of its agencies. The PSS head has been witnessed
at the offices of Al Quds numerous times in 1997. This close relationship
has resulted in a situation in which the goals of the PA (as seen by the
head of one of a powerful security agency) and the editorial perspective
of the newspaper are hardly ever in conflict. The newspaper functions as
a cheerleader to Arafat. There is little critical coverage on major political
issues, or a stage for alternative views. The situation of the Palestinian
press is quite similar to the semi-official Egyptian press.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The office of Arafat continues to interfere in the editorial
process of newspapers. Editors are told which stories to include and where
to place them. If &quot;requests&quot; made in the past were not honored,
the presidential office often expresses dissatisfaction. In the case of
stories that are known to the journalists, and show a serious problem with
a security agency, senior official , or Arafat himself, the newspaper is
asked to wait with the story until the situation is resolved. Then the story
will include a resolution of the problem, thus turning originally critical
news into a success story.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Self Censorship and cheerleading</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA has been successful in instilling a climate of fear
and intimidation on the community of journalists in Palestine. One result
is the practice of self censorship by journalists and editors, along with
the direct manipulation of the media described above.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This media manipulation is often hard to point at. An example
is the coverage of political activity. In the three daily newspapers, during
January-March 1997, one rarely sees mention of political activities of any
organization except Fatah. Statements by opposition leaders are published
routinely, as are paid advertisements announcing political events. Another
example is the coverage of human rights violations by leaders, but without
coverage of the violations themselves.The Al Baba case is an exception,
as it was covered extensively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The media in Palestine is not in a position to determine
public opinion or to spark public action. Rather, these roles are played
by leaders-in all levels of society-with the authority to dictate opinions
and actions. The source of authority is mostly external, coming as it does
through hierarchical channels. Journalists, as members of Palestinian society,
are subjects within this political culture more than they are autonomous
and independent actors. The exceptions to this merely prove the rule.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians Heave Sigh of Relief</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Following Attorney-General's Sacking</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lawyers, judges and human rights activists, as well as
many ordinary Palestinians, heaved a sigh of relief following the sacking
of the widely despised Attorney-General Khalid al Kidra by Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on 6 June. Arafat reportedly fired al Kidra after
the 70-year-old had &quot;outlived his usefulness&quot; and became an &quot;intolerable
liability,&quot; in the words of a PA Ministry of Justice official who asked
for anonymity. &quot;The man became an inseparable stigma attached to the
judicial system of the Palestinian Authority. He had to be removed,&quot;
intimated the same official.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 6 June, the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens'
Rights issued a statement expressing profound satisfaction at the sacking
of al Kidra. The statement, captioned &quot;Victory for Justice,&quot; said
the presence of this man in the crucial post of the Attorney-General did
an incalculable disservice to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian
people at large. &quot;He always twisted the arm of the law, violated the
letter and spirit of the law, made undue interference in court proceedings,
concocted charges against innocent people, and, not the least, ignored and
even defended human rights violations by PA security agencies.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;All this,&quot; the statement went on, &quot;made
him a premier obstacle impeding the administration of justice.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Kidra, a veteran Fatah activist who came to be hated
by the Movement's younger members for his &quot;excessive hypocrisy and
sycophancy&quot; is particularly blamed for the deterioration of Press freedom
and expression within the PA enclaves. In 1995, he ordered the closure of
the pro-Hamas weekly &quot;al Watan&quot; and its sister, &quot;al Istiklal&quot;,
which was published by the Islamic Jihad organization. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In both cases, al Kidra accused the two papers of &quot;incitement&quot;
and &quot;endangering paramount Palestinian national interests.&quot; Such
vague charges were often evoked by al Kidra to justify and repress the frequent
detentions without charge or unjustified trials of journalists, writers
and human rights activists. &quot;I never felt that he ever tried to uphold
the law,&quot; said Ghazi Hamed, Editor of the Gaza-based Islamist weekly
&quot;al Risala&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Kidra was also unpopular within Fatah. During the intifada,
he was shot in the leg by a disgruntled Fatah activist following widespread
rumors that he embezzled large sums of money destined for young intifada
activists. He has not fully recuperated from that injury.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other critics opine that al Kidra did only what his ultimate
boss, Yasser Arafat, told him to do. &quot;His main duty was to appease
and please Arafat, and, paradoxically, he ended up hurting and harming Arafat,&quot;
said a clerk at Gaza municipal council who expressed satisfaction at al
Kidra's dismissal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, al Kidra denied that he was sacked by Arafat,
arguing that he submitted his resignation to Chairman Arafat for reasons
having to do with his deteriorating health.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, whether al Kidra resigned or was made to resign,
his disappearance from the Attorney-General's office is a cause for relief
among most Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas Receives Lion's Share of Student Vote
in Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) achieved a big
victory at the student elections on 16 June at al Quds University, winning
31 seats or 61% of the 51 contested seats which make up the student general
assembly at the University. Four student blocs participated in the election,
including &quot;al Quds al Muslima&quot; (Islamic Jerusalem), the pro-Fatah
Shabiba, the leftist Action Front, and the moderate Islamic Independence
bloc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to results announced on the night of 16 June,
al Quds al Muslima, a coalition of Hamas and Islamic Jihad supporters, won
31 seats, followed by its chief rival, the Shabiba bloc, which won 16 seats.
The remaining three seats went to the leftists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Dr. Ali Khashan, who supervised the election,
70% of the student body at the college cast their ballot. Hamas achieved
remarkable victories this year at universities and institutes of higher
learning within the autonomous enclaves, which observers say reflects growing
public disenchantment with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority and the
peace process as a whole. Moreover, many more Palestinians have come to
lose confidence in the integrity of the PA following the disclosure two
months ago that hundreds of millions of dollars of public money had been
embezzled by high-ranking PA officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 16 June, a public opinion poll in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip revealed that 52% of the Palestinian people thought the PA
ministerial board had outlived its usefulness and should, therefore, resign
immediately. Moreover, the survey, which was conducted between 5-7 June
using a randomly-chosen sample of 1,317 respondents, showed that 63% of
the Palestinians believed that corruption was rampant within the PA administrative
hierarchy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the Gaza Strip, where the PA is believed to be stronger,
a staggering 74% of the respondents said corruption was increasing. The
survey was conducted by the Nablus-based Research Center, which is reportedly
financed, at least partially, by the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Outbreak of Meningitis Hits Gaza Strip</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority health officials declared a state
of emergency throughout the autonomous enclaves on 11 June in an effort
to combat an acute outbreak of meningitis in the Gaza Strip and parts of
the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Riyad al Zanoun, who holds the health portfolio in the
PA, revealed in a press conference on 11 June that as many as 350 cases
of meningitis were hospitalized in the Gaza Strip during the past few days.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meningitis occurs as a result of an inflammation of the
three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord and is caused by
either a viral or bacterial infection. Al Zanoun said 150 cases were treated
and released after full recovery, while as many as 200 cases remained in
hospitals for further treatment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian official exhorted the public not to panic,
stressing that the disease was mostly of the relatively benign viral kind,
not the more serious and potentially fatal bacterial variety. He called
on the public to thoroughly wash and rinse fruits and vegetables and not
to drink contaminated water.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many Palestinian physicians voiced increasing pessimism
at the deteriorating state of public health within some of the autonomous
enclaves. Dr. Ghazi Ikteit, a General Practitioner in Dura (about 12 miles
south-west of Hebron) disclosed that he had been recently receiving scores
of sick children suffering from various kinds of infections in their digestive
systems. Ikteit opined that the infections resulted for the most part from
drinking contaminated water.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dura, a town of 25,000, reportedly has been having an acute
water shortage this summer, forcing townspeople to fetch water from exposed
and antiquated wells dating back to the Ottoman era. The town's mayor, Mahmud
al Nammura, admitted that the municipal council was completely powerless
to solve the problem. &quot;The Israelis are stealing our water and they
control the tap, and the Palestinian Authority can't help us, hence we are
going thirsty; this is the problem,&quot; complained al Nammura with a tone
of frustration and hopelessness in his voice.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Injured Palestinian children find hope through
Relief Group</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ian Lucas</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jamal Shaheen was a normal 12-year-old boy playing in a
park in the West Bank town of Nablus when he saw a soda can nearby. Picking
it up, he noticed a white powder-like substance inside. &quot;When I looked
closely, it exploded,&quot; Jamal recalls. The blast amputated both hands
and took an eye, leaving the boy permanently disabled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last year, an American relief group called the Palestine
Children's Relief Fund heard of Jamal's situation from a doctor who saw
him, in Nablus. They contacted his family and learned that Jamal was not
receiving the treatment he needed. Though a bright boy, Jamal still needed
quality artificial hands and occupational therapy to teach him how to use
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In March, the P.C.R.F. brought Jamal and Nourhan Matar,
a 5-year-old burned refugee girl from the Gaza Strip for treatment in the
U.S. Nourhan was treated in Florida while Jamal was sent for treatment in
Philadelphia. Working with the Arab community, Jamal has been well supported
socially and medically in the Shriners Hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jamal is only one of many Palestinian children that have
benefitted from free medical care in the U.S. Since 1990, the P.C.R.F. has
brought over 80 injured children from Palestine and Lebanon for treatment
in the U.S. &quot;We have helped to treat gunshot victims from the Intifada,
bombing victims from camps in Lebanon, kids with terrible burns and children
born with diseases and need corrective surgery,&quot; says PCRF vice-president
and co-founder Sue Nasir. &quot;We have been fortunate to be able to do
something positive for Palestine at a period when we know only suffering
and oppression.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, from the American doctors and hospitals who provide
the children free treatment to the host families who house them while they
are being treated, the P.C.R.F. depends on the humanitarian spirit of many
people concerned. &quot;When you approach people to help on a humanitarian
level, most are happy for the chance to help a suffering child,&quot; says
Nasir. &quot;People don't see these kids as Palestinian or Arabs but as
human beings who need help. We have shown the Americans that we care about
our own children and also that we are victims of occupation, not the terrorists
that the media makes us out to be.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The P.C.R.F. was co-founded by Steve Sosebee, an American
journalist who was covering the story of a family in Hebron who had been
bombed by passing Israeli soldiers. &quot;When I saw the boy in the hospital
without legs and a hand, I had to do something to help him,'' says the young
American. &quot;I felt guilty for my government's behavior in the Middle
East, and as a writer I felt my efforts to expose what was really happening
in Palestine were futile. By arranging treatment for this boy in America,
I at least felt I did something to assist those who have given their blood
for freedom.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sosebee did more than just help a single boy from Hebron.
Seeing many other children in need, he co-founded in 1991 the Palestine
Children's Relief Fund with Sue Nasir to start bringing children who could
not get adequate care in the Middle East. &quot;I saw so many children who
were injured and not being treated there,&quot; Sosebee recalls. &quot;The
P.C.R.F. was established as a way to fill this void in the relief work for
Palestinians. No one was helping the individual cases who could not be treated
there.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since 1991, the P.C.R.F. has been the only organization
sending injured Arab youth to the U.S. for free medical care. In 1994, the
P.C.R.F. expanded to include injured children in war-torn Lebanon. Many
Lebanese and Palestinian children were in need of care outside of the country
and the P.C.R.F. has already treated a dozen such children in the U.S. More
injured youths from Israeli bombings in south Lebanon are coming for treatment
later this year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition to treating injured Arab children, the P.C.R.F.
also ships of medical supplies and equipment to institutions in Palestine
and Lebanon. &quot;We want to do what we can to improve the quality of medical
care so no children need to travel for treatment,&quot; says Sosebee. &quot;But
until that day, we will remain devoted to the individual kids who cannot
be treated in their homeland.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This summer, the P.C.R.F. has several injured youths going
to the U.S. for treatment. These include a 9-year-old boy shot in the head
by soldiers, a 14-yearold boy who lost his legs from an Israeli bomb, a
15-year-old girl whose parents were killed and she was burned in an Israeli
attack in south Lebanon and other children in need of medical care that
is not available to them in the Middle East. The P.C.R.F. also has several
shipments of medical supplies to go to the Middle East in the coming months.
They are seeking volunteers and support for these efforts.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Conversion Bill May Endanger Israeli Government</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A brewing controversy in Israel over &quot;who is a Jew&quot;
may endanger the very survival of the Israeli government, Israeli sources
said on Monday, 16 June. The controversy is centred around a proposed draft
law that would recognize as legitimate those conversions to Judaism performed
by Reformist and Conservative Rabbis, which has been vehemently opposed
by the influential Orthodox Rabbinate as well as most religious and ultra-religious
political parties in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, 15 June, leaders of the Reformist and Conservative
sects met extensively with Israeli politicians from across the political
and religious spectrum, including Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, in
an effort to expedite the passing of the conversion bill to rectify the
erstwhile inferior religious status of those affected individuals in Israel.
While Netanyahu refused to appear as siding with the &quot;heretic&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reformists and Conservatives, he nevertheless reportedly
promised to see to it that a compromise acceptable to &quot;all parties&quot;
be worked out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Israeli Trade and Industry Minister, Natan Sharansky
(currently facing charges of connections with the powerful Russian mafia)
vowed to quit the government if the conversion bill was not passed. Netanyahu
met with Sharansky on 16 June in an attempt to resolve the matter, but reportedly
to no avail. Sharansky had argued that failure to pass the bill would cause
a spilt between Israel and the world, especially American Jews, the bulk
of whom are affiliated with the Reformist and Conservative sects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Reformist leaders, Netanyahu is seeking to
produce an &quot;impossible formula&quot; whereby conversions by non-Orthodox
Rabbis would be recognized as legitimate while at the same time enable the
Orthodox establishment to retain its veto power over the conversion issue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Reuven Hammer, head of the Rabbinical Assembly
of Israel, the Netanyahu government would work out a formula by which Reformist
and Conservative converts can be registered as Jews, but would, at the same
time, give the Orthodox camp the feeling that these people were not exactly
registered as Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the second week of June, hostilities between the
Orthodox and the non-Orthodox camps developed into a near show-down when
ultra-religious activists spat on and shouted &quot;Nazis&quot; at a group
of Reformist and Conservative Jews who were praying at the Wailing Wall
in East Jerusalem. Eventually, the non-Orthodox Jews were forced to flee
the site after police failed to protect the group from the wrath of Orthodox
hoodlums who hurled stones at the &quot;heretics&quot; as well as &quot;Goyem&quot;
Arabs nearby.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The incident, not unprecedented, was half-heartedly condemned
by Israeli officials. Premier Netanyahu described it as &quot;terrible&quot;
but refused to denounce the perpetrators and their supporters.</FONT></P>

Camp Reached Explosion Point</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Conditions at the Meggido detention camp near Jenin, where
nearly 600 Palestinians are detained by Israel as &quot;hostages,&quot;
have reached the explosion point, a report issued by the Jerusalem-based
Prisoner Club revealed last month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report disclosed that Israeli &quot;Special Forces&quot;
stormed the detention camp several times in the last few weeks, severely
beating up detainees who were protesting draconian Israeli measures at the
camp. According to the report, which was published in leading Arabic newspapers
in the territories, scores of prisoners and the so-called &quot;administrative
detainees&quot; were either injured or suffered from gas suffocation during
the storming of the camp by an IDF crack unit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli troops reportedly raided the camp at least three
times in the last three months, with the most violent and savage attack
taking place on 19 March, resulting in as many as 20 injuries among the
detainees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to information smuggled from the maximum-security
camp, Israeli soldiers in full combat gear stormed detainee tents, beating
them &quot;in a bestial manner,&quot; and setting their clothes and belongings
on fire. Moreover, Israeli soldiers equipped with gas masks threw as many
as 50 gas bombs throughout the camp, causing asphyxiation to many detainees.
Five detainees reportedly fainted, and one, who apparently had cardiac problems,
collapsed unconscious consequently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Prisoner Club report blamed the Palestinian Authority
for not paying sufficient attention to the detainees cause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We, once again, appeal to Chairman Yasser Arafat
to take immediate action to save our brothers from the claws of Israeli
savagery and barbarism,&quot; said the report. The report pointed out that
the Israeli army sought to conceal its &quot;genocidal and disgraceful practices
against the defenseless detainees by cutting off the camp from the outside
world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday, 17 June, the Israeli Prison Authority issued
a statement admitting that conditions at Meggido were not &quot;idealistic.&quot;
The statement said that hundreds of administrative detainees (held without
charge or trial) were being transferred to other prisons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meggido Prison Chief Nera'am Gold-Brom told the Hebrew
daily &quot;Ha'aretz&quot; on 17 June that &quot;substandard conditions
contributed to disturbances and the death of several inmates at the camp.&quot;
Gold-Brom also revealed that 592 detainees were being detained at Meggido;
66% of them are affiliated with the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
and the rest are associated with Fatah and other secular Palestinian movements.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - Hassan Salamah, a
leader of one of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, denied
a report published by foreign news agencies on 18 May that he expressed
repentance in killing Zionists adding that those who published the story
should have more respect for honesty, the trade mark of their profession.
He added that Zionists are hateful people: bloodthirsty and oppressive.
&quot;They dispossessed the Palestinian People of their homeland in order
to establish their state which will be destroyed by Jihad,&quot; said Salama.
He stressed that he was not sorry for killing those who usurped the Palestinian
land,and brutalized its people. &quot;If there is anything to be sorry for,
it is for every moment that passed without killing one of those criminal
Zionists who seek to destroy and corrupt the whole world,&quot; Salama pointed
out, adding that those who think that Israel will win in the face of Jihad
and patriotic struggle are deluded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hassan Salama, 29, was arrested by occupation authorities
on 20 May 1996 after being seriously injured in a clash with Israeli soldiers
in Hebron. The Israelis accused him of planning and carrying out a number
of suicide bombings, including two in Tel Aviv last year in which scores
of Israelis were killed and injured. Salama is now facing a death sentence.</FONT></P>

served no other purpose but to appease Zionists and the American Administration.
&quot;We write this plea because we do not see any hope of being released
from this dark plight in which more than 70 Mujahideen (followers of Al
Qassam Brigade) and their families are suffering from oppression. We are
being detained in PA jails for deeds we were supposed to be honoured for,&quot;
they said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These detainees were the pride of the People, sacrificing
their souls to defend their land and people. They made the Zionist enemy
taste humiliation and fear. We do not want to reveal what these Mujahideen
suffered in the PA's interrogation rooms at the hands of some Palestinian
officers whom we thought stood with us against the hateful Zionist occupation.
Today they take us hostage to achieve political objectives and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>to pressure our Movement, Hamas, into accepting the peace
they signed with the Zionists. Why are we kept for so long in jail while
the PA is calling Israel for the release of Palestinian detainees? The Zionists
did not honour the so-called peace agreement they signed with the PLO. Meanwhile,
Jewish settlers kill a Palestinian today and are released from detention
the next day&quot;.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Prisoner Alive Although Israel
Claims Him Dead</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Sources of the Palestinian
Prisoner's Friends Society revealed that Israel had been detaining Emad
Zakzouk since June 1995 although it had announced his death two years ago.
Emad was one of three Palestinians who crossed the Jordan Valley into occupied
Palestine on 23 June 1995 to carry out a military attack against Israeli
targets. The three were later detected by an Israeli patrol. The other two
were arrested without resistance but Emad clashed with the Israeli soldiers
and was injured and arrested. Sources added that Emad's family in Jenin
of the West Bank were summoned to receive their son's body in August 1995.
Zakzouk's family received and buried a body which they believed to be their
son's. But a Palestinian detainee who was detained in Eshkelon jail for
40 days informed Zakzouk's family that their son was alive and that he had
spoken to him through a small window in Emad's solitary confinement cell
in Eshkelon prison. The sources pointed out that their Society contacted
a number of Israeli members of the Knesset, human rights organizations and
the Red Cross to force Israel to reveal Emad's detention place. They expressed
concern over his health and fate. They stressed upon the fact that Israel
hides some prisoners in order to recruit them as agents for Zionist secret
service in some Arab countries or to use them in military factories as guinea
pigs in dangerous chemical and radioactive experiments.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel Floods Palestinian Markets with Spoiled
Foodstuffs</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gaza - Director of the inspection department at the PA's
Ministry of Supply accused Israel of flooding Palestinian markets with spoiled
foodstuffs with the aim of destroying the health and morale of the Palestinian
society. Saleh Abdel Aal said Israel considers the Palestinian territories
as dumping sites. &quot;It supplies the Palestinian markets with spoiled,
poisoned and expired foodstuffs,&quot; he added. The Palestinian official
pointed out that his ministry seized more than 600 tons of Israeli spoiled
foodstuffs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the past five months.
&quot;The Israeli settlements are the source of these foodstuffs. We seized,
for example, about 600 kilos of Israeli chewing gum which causes infertility
for both men and women,&quot; Abdel Aal said, noting that Palestinian children
were rushing to buy the Israeli chewing gum because of its cheap price without
knowing its potential health hazard.<BR>
