BOMBING</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT(30 July) </font></b><font SIZE="+1"></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In what is largely viewed as a retaliatory response to
the defamation by Jewish settlers of the Prophet Muhammed on 28 June, two
Palestinian youths blew themselves up in a crowded West Jerusalem market
Wednesday afternoon, killing 16 Israelis and injuring as many as 140 others.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The incident occurred around 1:15 local time (10:15 GMT)
at the Mehane Yehuda marketplace in West Jerusalem.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli police chief Assaf Hefetz said two suicidal bombers
apparently simultaneously detonated two large bombs they were carrying,
resulting in the high toll of casualties.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The bodies of the two suspected Palestinians were found
in the rubble, but as of now they have not been identified.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli hospital sources said as many as 20 people sustained
serious injuries while at least five others were in &quot;very critical
conditions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">So, far no Palestinian organization has claimed responsibility
for the incident. However, Israeli sources suspect that radical Islamic
elements may have carried out the bloody attack.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli intelligence sources described the bombing as a
&quot;big disaster.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Knesset member and former Shabak head, Gedeon Ezra, said
in a radio interview after the bombing that Israel would need a long time
to &quot;absorb&quot; the bombing.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">He called on the Palestinian Authority to enter immediately
into a full and comprehensive intelligence and security cooperation with
Israel for the purpose of &quot;eliminating the terrorists.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Following the incident, the Israeli army imposed  a strict
closure on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, preventing Palestinians from
entering Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Palestinian workers in Israel were ordered to
return to their places of residence immediately.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian and Israeli sources said more collective punishment
measures were expected, including massive arrests among people with Islamist
orientations and home demolition.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">REACTIONS</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat telephoned Israeli
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to express his condemnation of the incident
and condolences over the loss of life in the bombings.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Netanyahu's media advisor, David Bar Illan, described as
&quot;very difficult&quot; the telephone conversation.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Bar Illan said Netanyahu scolded Arafat, telling him &quot;to
stop talking and start doing something to fight terrorism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Arafat reportedly assured Netanyahu and latter Israeli
president Ezer Weisman that he would do every thing he could to fight &quot;terrorism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian observers, however, don't believe that the
bombing was aimed specifically at sabotaging the peace process which was
in a precarious state long before the incident that a bombing could only
contribute to its revival rather than its collapse. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The bombings, while can not be isolated from the overall
context of the Israeli of narrowing Palestinian horizons, are likely to
have been precipitated by the pasting last month of anti-Islamic posters
in Hebron which caricatured the Prophet Muhammed as a pig writing the Quran.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">So far, most ordinary Palestinians reacted with conspicuous
apathy toward the bombings.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Indeed, virtually all Palestinians this reporter has been
talking to pinned  &quot;central responsibility&quot; for the incident on
the Netanyahu government for pushing the Palestinians to the borders of
 catastrophe.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Netanyahu has pushed us to a situation where we would
have nothing to lose and nothing to be sorry for or about,&quot; said a
Hebron policeman who refused to identify himself.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;If he wants suicide bombing, then he will get them,&quot;
added the man, rather laconically. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Arafat Seeks to Regain Popularity in Hebron</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">(News analysis by Khalid Amayreh)</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Hebron -PT (29 July)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in
al-Khalil (Hebron) Monday night in what was described as a &quot;routine&quot;
visit which observers believe is aimed at regaining popularity among the
mostly pro-Islamist population of this conservative town.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Upon arrival in Hebron, Arafat met with local political
and civic leaders, including Hebron mayor Mustafa Natshe, himself appointed
by Arafat.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Arafat also met with several Islamist leaders, including
the recently elected administrative board members of the local Islamic Youth
Association. Later on, Arafat is expected to meet with the Islamist head
of the local chamber of commerce, Hashem Natshe, who will reportedly communicate
to the chairman &quot;our people's disenchantment with the political process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In fact, Arafat's and PA popularity has been steadily plummeting
in Hebron, a traditional stronghold of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood,
as well as in other Palestinian regions.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In May, a PA police officer manning a roadblock in Hebron
shot and killed a local youth &quot;because he didn't heed orders to stop.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The incident, only the latest in a series of similar incidents
blamed on &quot;inexperience,&quot; sparked off widespread anger and indignation
among the local population that the victims funeral turned into an opportunity
for disgruntled Hebronites to vent their frustration at the PA.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, there seems to be more fundamental and underlying
reasons contributing to Arafat's receding popularity in Hebron.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The town, which Arafat declared less than a year ago &quot;liberated&quot;
three times, is actually still an occupied town. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Any visitor to Hebron today will see for himself that the
town is surrounded by the Israeli army on all directions and that one can
not possibly leave the town, or return to it in case he succeeded in leaving
it, unless allowed to do so by Israeli soldiers manning the ubiquitous roadblocks
erected on roads to and from Hebron.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">More to the point, undercover Israeli soldiers disguising
themselves as Arabs reportedly have been roaming the streets of Hebron,
chasing &quot;fugitives&quot; and &quot;wanted activists&quot; and dragging
them in the full view of PA police to the Old town where the Israeli army
has full security responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last month, an IDF undercover unit abducted several Palestinian
stone-throwers from the Bab el Zawiyya commercial district where PA police
maintain a strong and conspicuous presence.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The incident drew angry reactions from the citizens who
began making analogies between the role played by the PA police vis-¦-vis
Israel and that performed by the Israeli-backed and financed South Lebanon
Army.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Furthermore, disillusionment with Arafat rose markedly
recently when the PA decided to deploy hundreds of policemen along the &quot;partitioning
line&quot; separating H-1 and H-2 (the Old town and the area of Hebron run
by the PA).</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The PA step abruptly ended three months of &quot;confrontations,&quot;
believed to have initiated by the PA itself, in which at least two Palestinian
youngsters were killed and as many as 500 were injured.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A local Islamist leader, Muhammed Jamal Natshe, described
PA management of the unrest as &quot;totally stupid.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;It is lamentable indeed that after we lost two martyrs
and sustained 500 injuries, the PA returns to a business-as-usual policy
toward the Israelis,&quot; said Natshe.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The enduring unrest in Hebron also hit hard the local economy
thanks to the hermetic closure of the town by the Israeli army, which lasted
more than six weeks, rendering Hebron a virtually &quot;shut-in ghetto.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">With the political process stranded in its more or less
precarious state, and with the PA manifestly unable to develop its autonomous
authority toward a more promising arrangement that would give the Palestinians
a genuine hope for a better tomorrow, the PA and Arafat will likely continue
to languish between the Israeli hammer and the Palestinians' anvil.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, Arafat is not known of giving ample deference
to his people's disenchantment. The Chairman, it is well known, always values
the legitimacy that comes from international acceptance, e.g. American acceptance,
more than that which comes from his people's acceptance.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hence, it is safe that the Palestinian powder-keg will
continue to grow more tender with or without Arafat's approval.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">JERUSALEM MUSLIM OFFICIALS VOW TO</font></h3>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">PROTECT AL AKSA MOSQUE</font></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem -PT(27 July)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Muslim Wakf officials in Jerusalem have vowed to protect
the Aksa Mosque against renewed Jewish attempts to hold prayers at the site
and, therefore, gain a foothold at Islam's third holiest site.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Hasan Tahbub, who holds the religious affair portfolio
in the Palestinian Authority administration, said Sunday the Muslims of
Jerusalem would not allow Jewish extremists &quot;to transgress against
our mosque.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Tahbub warned that any renewed intrusion by Jewish extremists
into the Al Aksa plaza would &quot;set the place on fire because Muslims
will not bear seeing their most sacred shrine being desecrated by the extremists.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We know quite well what these evil elements are after.
They are after the mosque itself; they want to destroy the Mosque and build
their alleged Temple on its site,&quot; Tahbub told Journalists on Sunday.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Tahbub and other members from the Supreme Muslim Council
met briefly Sunday with Israeli police officials in an effort to avert a
showdown over a planned attempt by the head of a fanatic Jewish group to
pray at the Islamic shrine.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Following the meeting, Israeli police briefly detained
Yehuda Etsioni, for &quot;endangering public safety and security.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, Etsioni apparently escaped from police custody
and was able to slip into the Mosque plaza, disguising himself as a Mexican
tourist, before he was detained again by the police. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last week, an Israeli court issued a ruling allowing Etsioni,
head of an ultra-religious group called &quot;Hay Ve Kiyyam&quot; to pray
within the confines of Jerusalem's Haram al Sharif.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Interestingly, the declared goal of Hay Ve Kiyyam, indeed
its reason d'?tre, is the destruction of al Masjidul Aksa (al Aksa
Mosque) in preparation for the &quot;rebuilding of the Solomon Temple&quot;
on its site.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Leaders of the group, who have many supporters in Israel,
are driven by eschatological beliefs stipulating that redemption of the
Jewish people would not be fulfilled unless the temple had been &quot;re-established&quot;
on the same site now occupied by the al Aksa Mosque.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">There are several fanatic Jewish groups subscribing to
&quot;the Al-Aksa-destruction-theory&quot; including, inter alia, &quot;the
Temple's Faithfuls,&quot; &quot;Kahana Hay,&quot; &quot;Gush Emunim and
its various splinter groups,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Hay Ve Kiyyam.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The mentioned groups believe that the existence of the
Hebrew state is meaningless without the temple, which they view as the &quot;symbol&quot;
of Jewish redemption and self-fulfillment.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The latest attempted aggression against the al Aksa Mosque
coincides with frenzied Jewish efforts to obliterate the Arab-Islamic identity
of East Jerusalem which take the form of building Jewish colonies in the
midst of Arab neighborhood and practicing the policy of &quot;ethical cleansing&quot;
against the Arab population of the town.<br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">JEWISH MAYOR DESECRATE NEGEV MOSQUE</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem -PT(26 July)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli authorities prevented hundreds of Muslims from
holding congregational prayer at the Be'ir al Sab'a Mosque Friday 25 July,
by dumping several truckloads of garbage at the premise's entrance, forcing
worshiper to hold their prayer on the street.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The worshipers, who came mostly from Be'ir al Sab'a itself
and surrounding Bedouin villages, protested the desecration of the Mosque
(reportedly on orders of the town's mayor Eli Boker) by holding a demonstration
outside the mosque.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Demonstrators shouted slogans demanding the reopening of
the mosque for religious services.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">One demonstrator, 25-year-old Hasan abu Rbei'a attacked
official Israeli racism and religious discrimination against non-Jews.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The Jews who themselves were for a long time victims
of racism are now indulging in the worst kind of racism and religious discrimination,&quot;
said Abu Rbei'a</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Look! this is a Muslim mosque which was built in
1906, 42 years before Israel's birth, and they are preventing us from entering
it and praying therein,&quot; he added angrily.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Knesset member Abdul Wah-hab Darawshe, who
took part in the demonstration, the municipal council of Beir al Sab'a object
adamantly to Muslims recovering and restoring the Mosque purely for &quot;racist
reasons.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They simply don't want to see any Muslim presence
here,&quot; Darawshe told journalists outside the Mosque. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Another Knesset member participating in the protest was
Talab al Sane'i who further castigated &quot;state-sanctioned anti-Islamic
racism in Israel&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Sane'i vowed that Muslims would return to the mosque
every Friday until they recover it from usurpation.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The scum of racism will not succeed in making us
abandon our most legitimate right in restoring our mosque and praying in
it...this is our mosque, &quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Juma'a al Ksasi, former mayor of the Bedouin town
of Rahat, also attacked the &quot;dogged Jewish insistence on arrogating
our holy shrines.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They must understand that the dignity of our holy
places is an integral part of our human personal dignity.&quot; said Al
Ksasi.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">He added that Muslims in the Negev would continue their
struggle until the liberation and recovery of the Mosque.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In other development, Muslim leaders in Palestine have
warned against recurrent Jewish attempts to forcibly enter the AL Aksa Mosque
and hold prayers with al Haram al Sharif compound in Jerusalem.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Hayyan al Idrisi, an Imam at al Aksa Mosque said
Muslims were watching keenly &quot;systematic Israeli efforts to gain a
foothold at the al Aksa Mosque.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">He called on the Muslim world to &quot;stop playing the
spectator's role and do something for al Masjidul Aksa.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Israeli High Court issued a ruling in May allowing
ultra-religious Jews to hold prayers within the confines of the Al Aksa
plaza.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The decision drew angry reactions from Muslim leaders in
Palestine. <br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">MPs: PA Acts As an Israeli Puppet</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (24 July) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Several Palestinian Legislative Council members have castigated
the Palestinian Authority leadership for &quot;acting as an Israeli puppet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The councilors' anger stemmed from PA Chairman Yasser Arafat's
decision to order the arrest and trial of several PA police officers accused
by Israel of &quot;implication in planning anti-Israeli activities.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Abdul Fattah Hamayel, a councilor from Tulkarm, voiced
bitterness at the PA for being &quot;so responsive to Israeli charges and
pressure.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;When the PA acts on Israeli charges by arresting
and trying Palestinian police officers, it conveys a very bad message which
says the Palestinian Authority is just an Israeli puppet,&quot; said Hamayel
during a Legislative Council session in Ramallah on 22 July.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A similar feeling was expressed by Nablus councilor Muawiyya
al Masri who accused the PA of showing &quot;appalling submissiveness to
Israeli blackmail.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Masri questioned bitterly how the Israeli occupation
authorities could stop the car of Col. Munir Abbushi, arrest, handcuff,
and blindfold him before being taken away to an Israeli detention camp amid
official Palestinian Authority silence.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;What the Palestinian Authority has been doing in
this regard shows that it is but a tool in the hands of the Israelis, nothing
but,&quot; said al Masri.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hamayel, al Masri and another councilor, Qaddura Faris,
of Ramallah, unanimously agreed that Israeli occupation authorities were
pressing charges pertaining to Palestinian police involvement in anti-Israeli
activities solely to extract more political concessions from an increasingly
vulnerable and weak Palestinian authority.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last week, Arafat ordered the formation of an inquiry commission
to look into Israeli charges that high-ranking Palestinian police officers
were recently involved in planing and carrying out hostile acts against
Jewish settlers in northern West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Among PA officers detained by the autonomous authorities
is Col. Jihad al Massimi whom Israel had accused of masterminding a planned
attack on Jewish settlers near Nablus.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sever other lower-ranking officers were reportedly detained
or dismissed from duty.<br>

</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Hebron- PT (21 July) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">As many as 20 thousand Palestinians swore allegiance to
the Prophet Muhammed (PBOH) in Hebron on 19 July amid renewed tension between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority over alleged involvement of Palestinian
police officers in acts of resistance against Israeli occupation.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The large rally, bearing the title &quot;loyalty to the
Prophet&quot; was organized by the Islamic movement in the town in response
to blasphemous anti-Islamic posters pasted by a Jewish female settler on
Arab storefronts in Hebron three weeks ago.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Several Islamist speakers addressed the huge multitude,
reasserting the traditional Islamic stance against the Israeli occupation
and the political process and calling on Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
and Arab-Muslim states to terminate their subservience to American hegemony.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Nayef Rajub, a charismatic speaker from the town
of Dura 12 miles south west of Hebron, described the Jewish attack on the
Prophet Muhammed and the Quran as &quot;absolutely compatible with inherent
Jewish disrespect of other peoples' religions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Their latest profanity is no surprise to anybody
who reads the Talmud,&quot; said Rajub.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The imam of the Grand Mosque in Dura said there was inherent
Jewish enmity toward the person of Prophet Muhammed since &quot;he put an
end to their settlements in the Arabian Peninsula and exposed them naked
before the whole world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Rajub also blamed Muslim leaders, without naming any of
them, for &quot;having the audacity to insult the prophet of Islam.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We bitterly notice today that throughout the Muslim
world the only people who can stand up to Jewish insolence and arrogance
are behind bars.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Azzam Salhab, who was introduced as &quot;official representative
of the Islamic Movement,&quot; urged the PA to release all political prisoners
and &quot;not to close the door in the face of those who desire to fight
those who usurped our homeland, arrogated our rights, and destroyed our
homes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Salhab, a professor of Islamic Studies at the Hebron University,
also called on the PA &quot;to respect political pluralism, freedom of speech
and the press, and to put an end it nepotistic appointments in the public
sectors.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Salhab castigated the PA policy of appointing
&quot;municipal committees&quot; to run local councils throughout the occupied
territories, describing it as amounting to &quot;raping citizens' rights
and confiscating our people's freedoms.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Islamist organizers of the rally pasted huge posters
and posted signs warning Jews against &quot;perpetrating this crime against&quot;
and vowing &quot;to burn the hands of those who insult the greatest man
in the past, present and future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hebron is considered a traditional stronghold of Hamas.</font></p>

as guinea-pigs</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (17 July) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has systematically carried
out &quot;scientific experiments&quot; on Palestinian detainees in Israel,
Palestinian and Israeli sources said.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A report published Thursday 17 July in major Arabic newspapers
in the Occupied Territories revealed that &quot;as many as 1000 drug-related
experiments are carried out every year on Arab prisoners in Israeli prisons
and detention camps.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to the report, which quoted reliable Israeli
sources including Knesset members, the Israeli health ministry granted major
drugs-manufacturing companies in Israel more than a thousand permits to
use Palestinian prisoners as &quot;lab animals&quot; to test the effect
of new drugs.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The scandalous practice was initially disclosed by Labour
Knesset member Dalya Itsek who reportedly demanded that an independent investigation
to that effect be carried out.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Itsek revealed that &quot;at least 1000 experiments involving
dangerous drugs are carried out each year on Palestinian prisoners without
their knowledge.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The disclosure has not been completely denied by Israeli
health ministry officials.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Ami Livnat, Head of Drugs Department at the Ministry of
Health, reportedly admitted that &quot;there has been a 15% increase in
the number of experiments on inmates.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The shocking revelation drew sharp reactions from human
rights groups, the detainees themselves and their families.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Saleh al Haj Yahya of the organization &quot;Physicians
for human rights,&quot; described the revelation as &quot;appalling.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;If the report is proven true, then I won't find the
words to describe our reactions towards it,&quot; said Yahya.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Yahya himself revealed that news of the scandal was initially
leaked by a Likud activist whom he names as &quot;Moti Areil.&quot; However,
Yahya wondered why a &quot;Likud stalwart would uncover a scandal as such.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">Israeli officials: no comment</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli officials, including health officials, apparently
sought to move swiftly to limit the damage and &quot;not to make a big issue
out of it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Yahya told the Gaza-based weekly, al Risala, that he had
tried in vain to contact Israeli health officials on the matter.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;I even tried to contact Dalya Itsek of the Labour
Party who spoke about the subject in the Knesset, but to no avail,&quot;
said Yahya.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Raji al Surani, head of the Palestinian Centre for Human
Rights, also sought to contact Israeli officials on the matter but without
success.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;No body can ignore a subject as such...It is a stigma
of indescribable proportions.&quot; said Surani.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">Evidence </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Human rights organizations in the occupied territories
have not been surprised. Representatives of these organizations readily
point out that many of the released Palestinian prisoners suffer from chronic
symptoms that had not existed prior to their detention. Indeed, the death
of at least 45 Palestinians either in detention or soon after their release
constitutes a prima facie evidence incriminating the Israelis. These deaths
have not been investigated as they are routinely dismissed by the Israeli
Prison Authority as &quot;of natural causes.&quot; </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Palestinian Authority caves in to Israeli
ultimatum</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem -PT(14 July) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Palestinian Authority moved swiftly Monday to &quot;restore
law and order&quot; in downtown Hebron, thus budging to Israeli demands
to that effect.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The PA deployed as many as two hundred uniformed policemen
and half as many Preventive Security agents in plain-clothes to downtown
Hebron in order to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; between Palestinian
demonstrators and Israeli settlers and soldiers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian police sources said the decision to deploy
the police force in downtown Hebron was made on Yasser Arafat's instructions,
and was reached during a late-night meeting between Palestinian officers
and their Israeli counterparts.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to PA police chief, Tareq Zeid, the agreement
stipulated that Palestinian police be responsible for maintaining law and
order in H-1, an obvious euphemism for suppressing the anti-occupation protests
in the city.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In return, the Israeli army reportedly agreed to remove
the concrete slabs which had been placed in the middle of the Shallala street
and paralyzed traffic between the Old town and the rest of Hebron.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, according to Zeid, the Israeli army agreed to
end its siege on Hebron and surrounding villages, and to release Palestinian
youngsters who were detained in connection with the recent unrest.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">It is not clear if the Palestinian step to suppress street
demonstrations in Hebron was a subjugation to Sunday's stern warnings by
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu who threatened a sever response
in case &quot;Palestinian riots continued.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">More than 500 Palestinian youngsters were injured, some
seriously, by Israeli rubber bullets and gun-shots during five weeks of
unqualified confrontations between stone-hurling activists and heavily-armed
Israeli soldiers. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">Mixed Reactions</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The abrupt intervention by the PA to &quot;restore law
and order &quot; to Hebron drew mixed reactions in this embattled city.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Yousef Takrouri, a shoe-maker at the Bab el Zawiya commercial
centre, criticized the PA for &quot;betraying the blood of our youngsters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Look, they (the PA) encouraged the boys to take to
the streets and to throw stones at Israeli soldiers, and now they return
to business-as-usual with them,&quot; sighed Takrouri.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Another Hebronite was even more embittered.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;I won't resist the Israelis any longer because every
time we carry out acts of resistance, we are undercut by the PA,&quot; said
a Youngster who opted to keep his identity anonymous.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Other Hebronites welcomed the return of a semblance of
normal life to a town that has suffered badly as a result of the enduring
unrest.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We have been placed for too long between the anvil
and the hammer, we need a respite,&quot; said Hamed al Karaki, a Palestinian
shopkeeper who was forced to close off by Israeli soldiers following the
explosion of a home-made explosive device outside his shop last week.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The relative calm in Hebron is likely not to last for a
long time to come. At best, it will be just a respite. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">PA accuses professor of harming national
reputation</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (14 July) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian Authority police continued to detain a Gaza
professor for the second consecutive week for &quot;undermining national
reputation and distorting PA image.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Fathi Ahmed Subuh, a professor of education at al Azhar
University in Gaza reportedly went on a hunger strike last week to protest
his continued detention at a former Israeli prison in Gaza.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Subuh, 44 years old and father of five children, was arrested
by Preventive Security agents on charges pertaining to submitting questions
on a final exam which reportedly were critical of PA administration.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Subuh's wife, Fatima, told &quot;PT&quot; here husband
had not had any problems with the PA and that he was arrested 23 times during
the Israeli occupation for membership in Fatah, the PLO mainstream faction,
and for involvement in anti-Israeli activities. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;My husband should be released immediately because
he is innocent and did nothing wrong,&quot; said Fatima Subuh. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group,
the charges against Subuh are unclear and aimed at silencing political dissent.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They (the Palestinian Authority) wants to make sure
that people have eyes that see not, ears that hear not and mouths that speak
not, for this is the perfect environment in which a corrupt and despotic
regime can survive and thrive,&quot; said a spokesman for the PHRM who opted
not to mention his name.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Amnesty International has declared Subuh a prisoner of
conscience and urged human rights organizations to send telegrams and letters
of protest to PA chairman Yasser Arafat.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The detention of Dr. Subuh has been completely ignored
by the PA-controlled media.</font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Hebron- PT (13 July)</font></b><font SIZE="+1"> </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Israeli army has reinforced its 13-day siege on al
Khalil (Hebron), in effect isolating the town from the outside world and
cutting it from surrounding villages and hamlets.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Saturday, eyewitnesses spoke of long columns of cars
being stranded at Israeli checkpoints on roads to and from Hebron. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The scenes are a reminder of the situation that preceded
the installment of Palestinian Authority administration in Hebron and a
fresh proof that the PA is almost totally powerless in substance and now,
apparently, in form as well.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The effective siege on Hebron was imposed nearly two weeks
ago, ostensibly in response to continuing clashes in city-center, and also
as a warning to the PA that all the cards in the area are in Israel's hands.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Indeed, Hebron citizens readily admit that the latest Israeli
measures are reminiscent of the &quot;old days&quot; when the Israeli occupation
was &quot;direct, and un-vicarious.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">They point out that the Israeli siege on Hebron, which
has effectively reduced the town to a shut-in enclave, has demonstrated
the utter futility of the Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements as it shows
that Hebron is still an occupied town despite the presence of a 400-member
police force.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">This feeling of disenchantment is often expressed by Palestinians
who are stuck, occasionally for hours, at Israeli roadblocks.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The so-called liberated towns have suddenly become
isolated ghettoes,&quot; complained Walid Suleiman, 35, of the nearby village
of Dura, whom Israeli soldiers manning a roadblock just on Hebron northern
entry refused to allow to proceed to his town 8 miles away.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They told me that this was not their problem,&quot;
said an embittered Suleiman who had to circumvent about 50 miles to reach
Dura.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This means that the days of the occupation were much
better and that we have been victims of a sinister conspiracy,&quot; shrugged
Suleiman in exasperation..</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meanwhile, the Israeli commander of the West Bank, Moshe
Ya'alon, threatened to take stringent actions against Hebron citizen if
the current unrest continued.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Speaking to the Israeli army radio on Saturday, Ya'alon
warned the Palestinians that the occupation authorities would impose draconian
measures on Hebron and its surroundings in case the riots didn't stop.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Ya'alon didn't spell out the contemplated actions, but
observes believe they could include further restrictions on the current
closure on Hebron and barring Palestinian workers from Hebron and district
from reaching their jobs in Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, the Israeli authorities could make harder Palestinian
movement across the partition line between H-1 and H-2.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">As for the PA, it is no secret that it is finding itself
in an unenviable situation not only in respect to Israel but in the Palestinian
Main Street as well.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In light, and given the failure of the Egyptian efforts
to resume peace talks on the Palestinian-Israeli track, the PA must have
realized by now that a sort of popular explosion is inevitable and necessary,
if only to get out of the present deadlock.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">As to when the explosion will take place, the next few
weeks will tell. <br>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Al Khalil (Hebron)- PT (8 July)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Israeli army continued for the third consecutive day
Tuesday to close off Hebron, cutting off the town from the outside world.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Eyewitnesses reported that Israeli soldiers manning roadblocks
on routes to Hebron turned back passengers and prevented patients from reaching
hospitals in the town.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Israeli soldiers reportedly used the ubiquitous
roadblocks and checkpoints to arrest passengers who have &quot;Islamist
features&quot; such as grown beards.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Monday, three youths from Yatta, 15 miles south west
of Hebron, were arrested at a roadblock just outside Hebron and sent to
a detention center in the northernmost part of the West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to relatives, the youths were beaten up by soldiers
who reportedly threatened to kill them in case they resisted or protested
their detention.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities barred workers from
the Hebron area from reaching their jobs inside Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The punitive measure was taken despite the fact that the
said workers possessed valid entry permits.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In Hebron itself, the Israeli army has been beefing up
its troops at the old town and around the settlement of Kiryat Arba'a.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In this context, street patrols have been stepped up, and
more snipers have been stationed on Arab rooftops along the &quot;partition
line&quot; between H-1, which is administered by the Palestinian Authority,
and the old town, which is under complete Israeli control.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The bolstered Israeli military presence in Hebron is apparently
meant to forestall possible Palestinian protests against the desecration
of copies of the Quran by Israeli soldiers at the Ya'acobiyya school on
Sunday, 6 July. In other development, a high-ranking Palestinian authority
official in Hebron admitted that undercover Israeli soldiers were roaming
the PA-held area in violation of the Hebron agreement which grants the PA
full civilian and security control over H-2.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last week, the world's major television networks featured
undercover Israeli soldiers &quot;in action&quot; inside the PA-held enclave,
with PA policemen completely powerless to stop them.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Reacting to this, a spokesman for the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) in Hebron said he was not surprised by the penetration
by Israeli troops of H-1, arguing that the Israelis were acting in accordance
with the agreement, adding that the PA was embarrassed to publicly recognize
this fact.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;It is an open secret that the Hebron agreement between
Israel and the PLO grants Israel the rights to launch security forays in
H-1 when and if deemed necessary,&quot; said the Islamist spokesman.<br>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (6 July) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has vowed to respond
to last week's anti-Islamic posters in Hebron which depicted the Prophet
Muhammed as a pig writing the Quran.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A leaflet circulated by the Islamist movement throughout
the West Bank Sunday attacked Jewish settlers for embarking on &quot;an
abominable act as such,&quot; warning that the &quot;nefarious sin won't
pass with impunity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Holding the Holy Quran and our Prophet (may peace
and blessing be on him) up to mockery is a grand crime that won't pass with
impunity,&quot; said the two-page leaflet. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The leaflet described the blasphemous posters as &quot;the
diabolical feat,&quot; adding that it was but &quot;a natural extension
of the racist practices perpetrated by Zionist occupiers and successive
Israeli governments.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, the leaflet called on the Muslim Umma (nation)
to put up genuine efforts to challenge Zionist insolence and arrogance.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;All doors must be opened for Muslims to defend their
faith and religious shrines...and let the shackles of Oslo go to hell.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hamas pointed out in its leaflet that the Zionist crime
was merely a reflection of underlying thinking throughout the Jewish settler
population and a significant segment the Israeli Jewish society.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The movement also urged Arab and Muslim nations to &quot;immediately
stop and sever any normalization with the enemies of our Prophet...for this
is the least we can do to protest Jewish profanity against Islam.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Friday and Saturday, Hamas and the Islamic Movement
in Israel proper held two large demonstrations in Nablus and the Nazareth
respectively during which speakers demanded that Israeli Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu apologize to the entire Muslim world because degrading
the Prophet was not an exclusively Palestinian or Arab affair. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli officials did apologize to the Palestinians soon
after the posters were publicized by the media. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, the Israeli government refused, as always, to
take any action against Jewish settlers amongst whom anti-Islamic (and anti-gentile)
racism is abundantly rife.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In fact, children of Jewish settlers in Hebron shouted
anti-Islamic slogans in Hebron Saturday, demonstrating their (and presumably
their parents') admiration and support for the perpetrators of last week's
crime.<br>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (5 July)</font></b><font SIZE="+1">
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) staged a huge demonstration
in Nablus on Friday to protest the distribution in Hebron last week of profane
anti-Islamic posters by Jewish settlers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Thousands of people took part in the hitherto largest protest
in the occupied territories at the blasphemous act, with participants vowing
to defend &quot;our faith with blood and fire.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Copies of the Holy Quran were held aloft during the demonstration
as demonstrators carried signs reading &quot;Jews: Don't play with fire,&quot;
and &quot;Khayber, Khayber...the soldiers of Muhammed will return.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The massive march began at Masjidul Nasre in Nablus from
which it proceeded to city-center where it merged with several other marches
proceeding from the town's mosques.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">At the forefront were Sheikh Hamed al Beitawi, a senior
Islamist leader in the West Bank and an Imam at al Majidul Aksa (Aksa Mosque).
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Sheikh Jamal Salim and Jamal Mansur, both prominent
leaders of Hamas in the Nablus area, took part in the march.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Addressing the large multitude, speakers denounced &quot;the
Jewish profanity&quot; as &quot;consistent with Jewish hostility to religion,
prophets of God, and God Almighty.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Mansur said the Zionist crime was sparking off a
new intifada in the occupied territories, adding that &quot;attacking our
most sacred symbols is a red line we shall never allow anybody to cross
or approach.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This (degrading Islamic symbols) would cost you (the
Jews) dearly,&quot; said Mansur.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Beitawi opined that the sacrilegious posters in
Hebron was but a representative manifestation of &quot;intrinsic Jewish
hostility enmity and hatred of Islam, the Quran and the Prophet Muhammed,
may God's peace and blessing be upon him.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The blasphemous posters in Hebron was the main subject
of the Juma'a (Friday) sermon at Palestine mosques.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In Dura, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub said the Hebron incident was
merely a &quot;water- testing tactic&quot; by the Jews to find out how Muslims
would react when and if Jews sought to actually demolish the Al Aksa Mosque.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;If we stand idle and do nothing to defend Muslim
dignity, they will get encouraged and continue their criminal designs against
al Masjidul Aksa,&quot; said Rajub before three thousand worshipers in Dura
on Friday.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meanwhile, an Israeli magazine recently depicted Mary,
mother of Jesus, with a cow's head.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The journal, Gallelio, published an article on cloning
in which the Immaculate Mary had a cow's.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The new profanity angered Muslims and Christians alike
who saw in it a further proof of Jewish transgression against religion and
religious symbols.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;If a stone at a Jewish grave in a remote part of
Europe is removed, the Jews make a big outcry about anti-Semitism. However,
when Jews insult and profane other people's religions and sacred symbols,
they consider it part of their freedom of speech,&quot; said Dr. Hanna Atallah,
Official Spokesman of the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem in reaction to the
report.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Rev. Elias Odeh of the Latin Church in Nazareth expressed
horror at the &quot;spate of sacrilegious acts perpetrated by Jewish settlers
against Islam and Christianity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This behavior reflects a superiority complex among
many Jews who think of themselves as God's chosen people.&quot; said Odeh</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The editor of the magazine, Stivan Svetsky, admitted that
his journal &quot;should have been more sensitive to the feelings of certain
religious sects.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Svetsky didn't say why he had particularly chosen Mary
to illustrate his idea about cloning.<br>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Most Palestinians in the Occupied Territories observed
a two-hour general strike today to protest the anti-Islam posters pasted
on Arab shopfronts on Saturday 28 June by Jewish settlers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The strike paralyzed commercial life and brought public
transportation in most Palestinian towns, including East Jerusalem, to a
standstill.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In some areas, where the strike was not thoroughly heeded,
uniformed Palestinian policemen urged citizens to stay indoor in deference
of the strike call.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meanwhile, violent confrontations between Palestinian protesters
and heavily-armed Israeli soldiers continued unabatedly for the second consecutive
day.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Eyewitnesses described today's disturbances as &quot;the
most violent in two weeks.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian sources said that 10 demonstrators, including
four children, were injured by rubber bullets and taken to local hospitals
for treatment. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A spokesman for the Amira Alya hospital in Hebron described
the injuries of four demonstrators as serious.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">There were no reports of casualties among Israeli soldiers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded
when an explosive device thrown by a Palestinian went off near an Israeli
position along the demarcation line separating H-2 (under exclusive Israeli
control) and H-1, which is administered by the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">An Israeli army spokesman said the Israeli side was viewing
gravely Palestinian attempts to &quot;change the rules of the game.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The spokesman said the army was &quot;beefing up our forces
in Hebron in response to Arab escalation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In another development, Israeli soldiers shot and killed
a Palestinian protester in Deir al Balah in the Gaza Strip and injured four
others around noon Wednesday.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian sources said Israeli soldiers opened fire at
a group of Palestinian land owners trying to protect their land from seizure
by Jewish settlers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Maher al Assar , 17, received a fatal wound to which he
later succumbed at the Shifa'a hospital.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Observers opine that the Palestinian Authority is finding
it increasingly difficult to quell public anger over Israeli provocations
and what is often described as Benyamin Netanyahu's &quot;horizon-narrowing
policy&quot; vis-¦-vis the Palestinians.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In fact, many Palestinians seem to be further enraged not
only by PA powerlessness and inaction but also by its sycophancy to Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Tuesday, Israeli officials declared that the PA chairman
Yaser Arafat had agreed to fully resume security and intelligence cooperation
with Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian officials, embarrassed by the disclosure, refused
to comment.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">One Palestinian official, who asked for anonymity, said
&quot;Abu Ammar (Arafat's nom de guerre) had no choice but to budge to American
pressure.&quot; <br>
