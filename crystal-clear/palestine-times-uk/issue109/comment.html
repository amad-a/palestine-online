<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist regime, along with the United States, which submissively acts
at Israel&#146;s beck and call, is actively seeking these days to liquidate the
Palestinian question under the false rubric of &#147;a final peace agreement with the
Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At their disposal they have Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian autocrat who
seldom pays attention to the feelings and views of his people and often acts in connivance
with the Zionists and the Americans against Palestinian national interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sinister plan is to enable the Zionists to arrogate nearly all of
Palestine, including al-Quds al-Sharif (Jerusalem) and to perpetuate the dispersal of some
four million Palestinian refugees who have been waiting for justice for half a century,
but to no avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in order to make the deal less odious and offensive than it really is,
a package of promotional gimmicks are attached. These include a promise of a deformed
Palestinian political entity made up of disconnected and truncated strips of land in the
West Bank and surrounded by Jewish settlements on all sides, an entity that Arafat would
be able to call &#147;an independent Palestinian State&#148; but without Jerusalem as its
capital!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The gimmicks&#146; basket is also likely to include other inducements,
including a respectable sum of American dollars, which would likely be used by Arafat to
bribe some Palestinians into joining his boat and accepting the &#147;peace of the
brave.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from the travesty, things will not change much on the ground. The
Israeli army would stay entrenched in the West Bank, and Israeli occupation soldiers
manning checkpoints and roadblocks would continue to torment and humiliate Palestinians
travelling between the truncated bantustans of &#147;Free Palestine&#148;, and PA
officials, from Arafat to the smallest clerk, would continue to complain of Israel&#146;s
refusal to carry out the signed agreements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the four million helpless souls languishing in squalid refugee
camps would be left languishing for justice, while a few will be allowed into
Arafat&#146;s reservations on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, &#147;in fulfillment&#148; of
the right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, a fierce opposition to this capitulation would explode
everywhere among Palestinians, especially among the refugees. And Arafat and his security
apparatus would be further empowered by the Americans and the Zionists to repress all
active expressions of that opposition to the imposition of the Israeli <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These seem to be the main features of the next phase of the &#147;peace
process.&#148; Consequently, the Palestinian people and their free forces must take note
of the looming dangers and be prepared to deal with the disaster before it happens.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the way to forestall and thwart the conspiracy being devised now is to
form the broadest possible national front to face, challenge and foil the impending new
Nakba.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, all efforts must be mobilized to make the Americans, the Zionists
and especially Arafat reconsider this path leading to a sham peace agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians in the millions, Arabs and Muslims alike, as well as free
people from around the world, ought to tell Arafat that should he put his signature to a
capitulation document as such, he would go down in history as a traitor who colluded with
the enemy against his people and who betrayed his people&#146;s aspirations to further his
personal ambitions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, by putting his signature to such a disgraceful agreement, whether
it be called transitional, interim or permanent, the Palestinian leader would effectively
isolate himself from the rest of the Palestinian people and would effectively place
himself in a hostile position <i>vis-ï¿½-vis</i> the people. In this case, the actual and
potential implications aren&#146;t difficult to predict.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for the Zionist regime and its American subordinates, it should be made
sufficiently clear to them that an imposed settlement would be utterly rejected by the
Palestinian people whether at home or in the Diaspora.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It should also be made abundantly clear to the Zionists that the
Palestinians would resume active armed struggle for freedom and liberation, irrespective
of all other considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, the Palestinians would have little to lose as the Zionists
continue to seek to perpetuate the usurpation of their land and rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Americans say &#147;give me freedom or give me death.&#148; The
Palestinian slogan ought to be &#147;give me freedom or I give you death.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists ought to take note of this.</p>
