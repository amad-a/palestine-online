<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Reflection..</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The scene defies linguistic description....a 12-year-old child (Rami
al-Durra), in his father&#146;s arms, both seeking cover against a concrete wall from
Israeli soldiers&#146; bullets...The father&#150;like any father&#150;tries in vain to
shield his son with his arms and body....both terrified, helpless...sensing the macabre
smell of death....how do people behave when they see death approaching?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then a &#147;born-to-kill&#148; beast in a soldier&#146;s image and
bearing the star of David...a sadist, a barbarian with manifestly cannibalistic instincts,
observes poor Muhammed and pulls the trigger, shooting several rounds at the child&#146;s
tender heart....sending his helpless soul to the Most High...the father, distraught,
grieves, &#147;my son is dying&#133;my son is dying...&#148; as he desperately raises his
hand for help...but the same Nazi-Jew gives him no chance as he points his gun at the
confused father...and his indifferent hands pull the trigger again......then silence...An
ambulance ventures to save the child and the father, but the beast riddles the ambulance
with bullets....and kills the poor driver...and mission &#147;Muhammed Durra&#148; is
over.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The phantasmagoric scene appeared on TV screens....probably except in the
U.S....where pain must remain a Jewish monopoly...</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If that concrete wall behind which poor Muhammed sought cover from the
neo-Nazi&#146;s bullets could speak, it would probably weep and shed a lot of tears before
it uttered any words.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How could that vile beast view himself in the mirror again?....but a beast
has no guilty conscience....the beast was, after all, born to kill...born to kill...it is
the age of the barbarians...but why call the vile man a beast...beasts kill to
survive...but the sadist cannibalist kills for joy...only for joy...</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><font color="#0000FF"><strong>The father appeals to the world to help
bring the killers of his child to justice</strong></font><br>
</u><strong>Amman-</strong> Jamal Al-Dura, the father of Muhammed Al-Dura, the child
Israelis soldiers sadistically murdered in Gaza ten days ago, has appaled to the world to
bring to justice the murderers of his son.<br>
&quot;I appeal to the entire world, to all those who have seen this crime to act and help
me avenge my son's death and to put on trial Israel,&quot; he told Agance France Press on
Monday as he struggled to control his emotions.<br>
&quot;I also plan on taking Israel to the international courts and ask that the criminals
responsible for<br>
the death of my son be punished.&quot; Doctors in Amman's military Al Hussein Medical City
said Jamal will have permanent paralysis in the right hand and he is suffering from
psycholigical trauma from seeing his son die in his arms.<br>
&quot;It is the worst nightmare of my life,&quot; said frantically. &quot;My son was
terrified, he pleaded with me: &quot;for the love of God, protect me Baba (Dad).&quot;<br>
&quot;I will never forget these words. I did everything I could to shield him and I prayed
and prayed, in vain, that the soldiers would not aim at us,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;But they fired at us in a pre-meditated fashion and unrelentessly,&quot; he said/As
the shooting became more intense, Jamal raised his arm to better shield his son, sparing
him at least one bullet that lodged in Jamal's elbow, paralysing hisarm for life. &quot;My
son was first hit in the leg and then a deadly bullet struck him in the stomach and<br>
when he slumped over against me, I fainted for a while and then I came back and used my
mobile phone to call an ambulance.&quot; During yesterday's Al-Jazeera interview with
Jamal, he said, &quot;Rami was crying in terror,<br>
and telling me, &quot;Baba, don't be scared, don't be scared, save yourself and I am sure
an ambulance will come and save me...tell mom I love her&quot;..my son telling me,
&quot;don't be scared, don't be scared!&quot; TO ETERNAL HEAVEN, MY BRAVE BELOVED, TO
ETERNAL HEAVEN!&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>Maha Ghadban</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They hate what Hitler had done to them and they are doing much worse
things. They are no longer as they say preys, however the Palestinian are. What happens to
human rights, when a Jewish person gets killed? They make sure that the whole media is
aware of it. But All the thousands of innocent people get shot with international illegal
bullets it's perfectly all right. How do you want us to communicate with the peace process
when they are killing innocent people? Have you been watching the news lately? Let me tell
you a little story which recently occurred, a&nbsp;12 year old boy was walking with his
father to go to school, they heard shots so they hid behind a rock, the father pleaded for
the Isreali soldiers to stop shooting because he had his son with him. However they kept
on going, the kid gets shot on the leg and the father tells his young boy it's just on you
leg It's ok, they kept on shooting from all directions until the boy was shot in the chest
and the father was shot all over his arms and legs. Now how the hell do you want us to
agree with peace when you have monsters like that. Everyone should know who is the
innocent and who's the monster. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Intifada Al-Aqsa</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Erik Paul</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Day 6 -The outbreak of violence in Palestine erupted as a result of Ariel
Sharon's intrusion into the Muslim sacred site of Haram Al-Sherif in Arab East Jerusalem.
As of the time of this writing, more than 60 Palestinians have died on the sixth
consecutive day of violence and thousands than have been injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mostly unarmed civilian Palestinians in protest to the Israeli invasion of
their sacred site fight with their bare hands or throw stones. Their stones are met with a
storm of Israeli troops who fire anti-tank rockets, hand grenades and deploy combat
helicopters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">President Jacques Chirac of France said of the escalating violence that,
&quot;You don't fight the emotions of a people with armored cars.&quot;&nbsp; He also
stated that such violence was a set back to the peace process and that the origin of the
clashes was an &quot;irresponsible provocation&quot; caused by Ariel Sharon's visit to the
Muslim holy site. This visit led to a &quot;foreseeable explosion.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is happening in Palestine right now proves many things. One is that
the Palestinians have always been brave. But it is not lack of courage that might cause
their losses, but rather that they are surrounded by the Israelis on one side and corrupt
Arab leaders on the other.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Something else that has been proven countless times is that all Arab
leaders raise armies for their own personal protection, not for the protection of their
own people. If anything, many Arab leaders protect the Israeli government as much as the
Israelis themselves do. Yet they feign concern whenever Palestinians are killed and rush
to sterilized meetings filled with bouquets of flowers and bottled wines as if their
pretense will stop the river of Palestinian blood flowing in the occupied land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though the Americans always misrepresent the news and always make Arab
casualties less than they are and the circumstances of any conflict ambiguous, they never
fail to make the Israelis less guilty than they continue to be.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Arabs blame everyone but themselves for what is happening in</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestine but the West will treat Arabs in such a way as long as the Arab
leaders are corrupt and Arabs remain divided.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But it is not a shortage of Arabs and Muslim people who identify with the
Palestinians and their suffering, but a case of corrupt Arab leaders who live off the
flesh of their people and who want to keep the status quo so that they can continue to
grow fatter from the American dollars that keep their bank accounts well padded.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hilary Clinton is an actress on stage who does not seek a just solution to
the ongoing loss of freedom, lives and land inflicted upon the Palestinian people but
rather has become a turncoat to her very own sympathies before she began to run for
senator of New York.&nbsp; She has made sure that by criticizing the Palestinians and
their struggle for freedom by saying that they should not receive any more money because
they teach their children to hate, she will gain the Jewish vote in New York. &nbsp;&nbsp;
That infants such as little Sara Abdelhaq are killed by a hail of Israeli gunfire is of no
importance to her.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hilary did not stay with her husband all through the Monica Lewinsky
ordeal because of her noble character or out of the matrimonial commitment she made to her
unfaithful husband, but because of the personal gains she could make by remaining the
First Lady. She is a First Lady of Deceit in a country where morals have declined more in
the last few years than in all of American history. Funny that she does not mention that
Israelis should not receive any more of the billions of American dollars because of how
they terrorize, brutalize, torture and massacre Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is unique how Israelis take an incident that they began and are</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">responsible for and turn it around to make it look as if they themselves
were victimized. But even Roni Daniel, a veteran Israeli television journalist had to
remark when he saw the death of Mohammed al-Durah, (when cameramen for French television
captured his death on tape) the 12 year old boy who crouched behind his father for
protection when caught in the crossfire in Gaza, &quot;I've been doing this for many
years, and I'm not exactly a vegetarian. But my brain went dead and my tongue went limp.
To see a little boy killed before your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only a true Islamic Jihad will deliver Jerusalem back to Muslims. &nbsp;
All of Palestine is sacred. Perhaps the butcher Ariel Sharon who has the blood of
countless Palestinians on his hands has gone too far. No one has ever really forgotten the
brutal role he played in the massacres of Sabra and Shatella during the Israeli invasion
of Lebanon in 1982. He is not worth the lives of all who have died as a result of his
arrogant and barbaric actions. But death, one day too, thou shalt die.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for now, the Palestinians who live in the land of Palestine whether
occupied by Jewish invaders in 1948 or 1967, are reenacting what Rafik Natsheh, the
Palestinian labor minister said, &quot;Our people are ready to have 10 times the numbers
of martyrs, we gave too much to the peace process. We gave it to too much of a
chance.&quot;</p>

<p>Until now, the Palestinians have stood alone in their defense of Muslim holy places in
occupied Palestine. They are the ones who bleed for these Holy sites and they are the ones
who die for them. But we must remember that the responsibility for protecting these
shrines lies on the shoulders of every Muslim.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">We are the victims, you are <br>
the tormentors&#133;for 52 years!</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The vindictive smear campaign by the Zionist establishment and its
intelligence, police and media apparatus against the 1,250,000-strong Palestinian
community in the Jewish State should not come as a surprise to anybody with even the most
rudimentary knowledge of the annals of Israel&#146;s treatment of its Arab
&#147;citizens.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ever since the establishment of the Zionist State, the Zionist
establishment, and irrespective of which government or party is in power, has treated
&#147;Israeli Arabs&#148; (this is how they refer to the Palestinians who were not
expelled at gunpoint) as &#147;children of a lesser God&#148; that are a thorn in the side
of the Jewish State&#133;who deserve perpetual persecution, discrimination, contempt and
negligence at every conceivable level. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, it would be sufficiently safe to say that Israel&#146;s treatment
of its Palestinian &#147;citizens&#148; was far worse than the way the White man had dealt
with the American Indians in North America and with the Aboriginals in Australia. These
communities of minorities came eventually, though somewhat belatedly, to be treated as
&#147;equal citizens,&#148; at least at the official level.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Israel, however, the Palestinians, the natives of the land, who had
been toiling Palestine ages before Jewish immigrants set foot on Palestine in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are still treated as third or fourth class
citizens. In fact, they are not &#147;citizens&#148; at all, but merely &#147;permanent
residents.&#148; The reason for that lies simply in the fact that the Palestinians are not
Jews; they are &#147;goyem.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli treatment of its Palestinian community, which makes up nearly
20% of the population, can be described in many respects as &#147;criminal.&#148; Indeed,
if there was justice in this world, a court of law would probably declare Israel, <i>par
excellence</i>, a criminal State of the first degree.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish State had slaughtered the Palestinians, often <i>en masse</i>;
it banished them from their homes, often at gunpoint; it destroyed their villages and
hamlets and sought to obliterate the sites of these villages and hamlets; it even
unearthed the bones of their ancestors; it destroyed their places of worship; and
converted many mosques into &#147;national museums&#148; while leaving others to fall into
disrepair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish State sought with unrelenting determination to reduce the
remaining Palestinian towns and villages in 1948-Palestine (Israel proper) into isolated
and shut-in ghettos, resembling the ghettos in which Jews had lived prior to their
usurpation of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reason for that is the Zionists&#146; almost morbid desire to check to
the very minimum Palestinian demographic expansion so that Arab life in these ghetto towns
and villages would eventually become unbearable so much so that the Palestinians,
particularly the young generations, would contemplate leaving &#147;Eretz
Yisrael&#148;&#133;for good!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is virtually the same policy that the Israeli occupation army has been
following in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1967 whereby Arab horizons are narrowed
and Arab villages and towns are left to implode from within, mainly as a result of housing
shortages. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And when a Palestinian, whether in Israel proper or in the West Bank,
ventures desperately to build a structure to shelter his children from the cold of the
winter and the heat of the summer, the Zionist establishment immediately sends in its
bulldozers to demolish the newly-built house, thus deepening people&#146;s bitterness and
inflicting additional emotional pain on the already tormented victim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So the Zionists ravage the dream of an entire family of having a house
under the sky, all on the pretext that the house was constructed without a license&#150;so
much for Israeli justice. (Israel is the antithesis of Justice as the two are inherently
incompatible.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist establishment does not, of course, make any serious efforts to
understand why a Palestinian often embarks on building a house without receiving a
building license beforehand. Indeed, has the State given him a license to build a house
and he refused to take it? Has the State built a house for him (as it does for the Jews)
and he declined to live in it? Has the State treated him well and he reacted not in kind?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The answer to all these questions is definitely negative. For a State that
treats part of its supposed citizenry as &#147;unwanted&#148; (I am not speaking here
about words but rather actions) should not expect these citizens to demonstrate loyalty
and devotion to that State. The Jewish State incited against its Palestinian citizens
before they incited against the State, the State oppressed the Arabs before they
complained&#133;what else can the oppressed do?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish State did to its Palestinian citizens what defies linguistic
description&#133;it categorized them into sects and sub-sects. Thus, there is the Arab
sector, the Christian sector, the Druze sector, the Bedouin sector, then there are those
who serve in the army and those who do not serve in the army, and in each and every case,
the members of a given sector are accorded a respective treatment befitting the Israeli
intelligence&#146;s perception of that sector.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the Israeli police have disseminated its informants and spies
everywhere among the Palestinians to overhear every word and every sigh and every
complaint coming out of their vanquished hearts&#150;the hearts of the victims of
Israel&#146;s institutionalized and systematic oppression and
discrimination&#150;Israel&#146;s apartheid. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish State is yet to recognize the existence of many Arab villages
and hamlets that predated the establishment of Israel by decades, even hundreds of years.
The inhabitants of these villages and hamlets are denied the basic services such as
electricity and water, in addition to education and a decent living. Who needs whose
recognition? Or, are the Arabs children of a lesser God?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, and despite all of this, we see that the Zionist police
continually seek to keep the Arabs in a state of collective existential anxiety whereby
they feel they need to demonstrate their loyalty and prove their innocence in the morning
and in the evening. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why does the Jewish State behave as such toward its non-Jewish citizens?
Why does it send its police agents to entrap the leaders of the Palestinian community? Why
were Shin Bet agents asked to insert &#147;hashish&#148; into the pockets of Um-Al-Fahem
mayor Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah a few years ago? Why does the Jewish State meticulously
monitor every word uttered by the Arabs, while Jewish leaders, such as Rabbi leader Ovadia
Yossef, are given virtual <i>carte blanche</i> to proclaim his antics, such as saying that
&#147;Arabs are snakes&#148; and that &#147;God felt sorry for creating them in the first
place?&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Is Ovadia Yossef the son of the spirit while Abdul Malik <br>
Dahamshe the son of the flesh?</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What does Israel expect from its Palestinian citizens? Does it expect them
to degrade themselves to the extent that they become stripped of their dignity, robbed of
their feelings, and bereft of their humanity?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Does it expect them to warmly embrace the Shin Bet quislings and
collaborators who fled from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Southern Lebanon, having
perpetrated all these crimes and treacheries against their own people? How do nations
treat traitors and quislings? What did the Jews do to Kestener, the Jew who collaborated
with the Nazis? Didn&#146;t they kill him in the streets of Tel Aviv like a stray dog is
killed?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel will only harvest what it has sowed. It has sowed oppression,
persecution and racial discrimination against the Arabs for 50 years of
&#147;inquisition&#148;&#133;and now it has the shamelessness and audacity to ask
&#147;are our Arab citizens loyal to the State?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, there are among the Palestinians of Israel those who are willing to
give up their feelings, their dignity, and even their national identity. There are those
who are willing to work against their fellow countrymen for a few filthy dollars&#133;and
there those who are willing to spy on the imams of the mosques and to convey every word
they say to their Shin Bet bosses. Every community has its dunghill. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, alhamdulillah, these are a small minority, for the vast bulk of the
Palestinians inside Israel are dignified people who are proud of their national identity,
and won&#146;t accept to live save as free men and women on their ancestral land.</p>

<p>The ball is not and never will be in the court of Muhammed Baraka, or in the court of
Abdul Malik Dahamshe, or in the court of Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah&#133;It is neither in the
court of Um al-Fahem or Kufer Kanna. The ball is always in Zionism&#146;s court, in
Israel&#146;s court.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">A Palestinian boy and the UN Security Council</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Mohamed Khodr*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I watched the expensive and extravagant three-day United Nations
Millennial Summit in New York City held in September, I couldn&#146;t help thinking of the
large poster hanging in my home of two-year-old Muhammad Ali Abu-Swai (he&#146;ll be five
now if he&#146;s alive, God willing). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 4 August 1997, Israeli soldiers awakened Muhammad&#146;s family and
ordered them to leave. Within minutes, bulldozers demolished their home in the Ras
Al-Amoud neighbourhood in Arab East Jerusalem leaving the family homeless. In the
time-frozen picture of Muhammad, he is wearing a clean white shirt and yellow pants as he
stands barefooted on the stones of what used to be his home. As if in prayer, his fists
are clenched in front of his bowed head, with his eyes closed dripping with tears.
Muhammad stands alone in this picture, with no family and no Israeli soldiers appearing,
only his pained, fearful face and silent cry. Israel&#146;s demolition of Muhammad&#146;s
home, life, dreams, security, education, health and future goes unnoticed by the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The guilty party is out of sight and out of mind. In Israel&#146;s and
America&#146;s eyes, Muhammad has no one to blame but his great grandfather for not
accepting the Partition of Palestine in 1948 imposed by the institution that arose out of
the Holocaust&#151;the United Nations. I kept thinking how intertwined are the lives of
Muhammad and the United Nations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The UN became the &#147;psychotherapist&#148; for Western guilt,
colonialism and shame. UN resolution 181 that called for the Partition of Palestine became
the &#147;Prozac&#148; for the colonial powers of the Security Council. The Security
Council&#146;s members are former and current Colonial powers. They are four mainly
Christian nations and one officially atheist nation. All are nuclear powers with the most
powerful armies who by might alone have become the world&#146;s judges, jury and
executioners. By simply raising their hands, they decide which country gets bombed,
sanctioned, starved, expelled, or accepted. Security Council resolutions are usually
implemented in the Southern Hemisphere, on poorer nations, often Islamic or Arab, and
usually dark-skinned. Obviously, these five nations and their proxy countries are immune
to Security Council resolutions and thus can oppress and murder their own civilians such
as Russia in Chechnya or China&#146;s oppression of dissidents and religious groups. The
only other nation that is immune from complying with dozens of UN resolutions
is&#150;Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I watched the three-day UN Millennial Summit, I wondered whether
anyone, especially the Arab and Islamic leaders, was thinking of Muhammad and his inhumane
painful fate. Did they see the irony of celebrating an institution that in recent years
has become the whipping rod for the sole superpower in the world to impose its hegemony on
Arab and Islamic States thereby rendering their governments impotent and weak, clamouring
for American attention, money and photo opportunities? Even Arafat, Muhammad&#146;s
leader, is reduced to carrying out Israeli security policies upon his own people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sixty Arab and Islamic leaders attended this summit. They were all
sidelined as Clinton and Israel once again pressured Arafat to compromise. Ironically,
none of the negotiations were based on the 70 UN resolutions adopted over the last 52
years. None of the Arab and Islamic leaders who represent a fifth of the world&#146;s
population and 50% of the world&#146;s oil reserves, seized the opportunity of their
presence at the UN to unite and demand that the UN implement its resolutions, that Israel
accept international law, and that Jerusalem be shared. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muhammad, when you grow up, you may wonder whose fault it is you lost your
home. It&#146;s somewhat complicated, but in a real sense, everybody failed you: from your
own people, to the Arab and Islamic world, to a confluence of events in Europe and America
that allowed a small Jewish community to build their influence and money on the victims of
the Holocaust, to the United Nations and the entire world, and lastly to me. Can I do more
as an Arab American and Muslim to ensure that the world &#147;Never Forgets&#148; the
tears you shed on your occupied stolen soil? So many words have failed you, my little
friend, from the UN Charter to the UN Declaration of Human Rights, to dozens of UN
resolutions, including 181, 194 (right of return of Palestinians), 242, 338, 476 and 478
(declaring Israel&#146;s annexation of Jerusalem &#147;null and void&#148;), to the Fourth
Geneva Convention, to Israel&#146;s human rights abuses reported by Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch, and even the U.S. State Department, to several international peace
conferences, and finally the declarations of the Arab League and Islamic Conference. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Words, my friend, won&#146;t feed you, clothe you, shelter you, give you
an education, or a peaceful living. While we correctly blame Israel and America for your
miserable fate, what is the culpability of your corrupt autocratic leadership who build
rich mansions across from squalor refugee camps? Yes, Muhammad, Israel and the American
Jewish community, with the support of Christian Fundamentalists, do control America&#146;s
foreign policy. How else would you explain $150 billion in American aid since 1949 to the
17<sup>th</sup> richest nation on earth? However, my friend, the Arab world has
conveniently used Israel as an excuse for authoritative and undemocratic rule to cover its
incompetence while enriching its leaders. The Arab world spends on average 7%-8% of its
gross domestic product (GDP) on weapons while spending about 4% on education. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel refuses peace for ideological and expansionist reasons but just as
likely peace could lead Israel to a civil war. While in the Arab world, peace may just
lead to democracies and a window of opportunity for knowledge, prosperity and freedom
while keeping our Islamic faith and tradition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muhammad, I pray that you and your generation do not repeat our mistakes,
our passivity, our semi-attachment to Islam, our empty hyperbolic words and empty actions.
I pray that you seek knowledge, truth and justice and hold firm to your faith. We have all
failed you. Your only hope is to depend on Allah (SWT) and on yourself. Your pain will be
heard and your tears will be wiped. No injustice ever endures. God bless you and keep you
safe from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes. Palestine will be the 190<sup>th</sup>
country to be admitted to the UN&#150;an organization that is now &#147;null and
void.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Beyond a declaration</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Mustafa Al-Barghouti*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two deadlines coincide on 13 September; the date set for the declaration
of a Palestinian State, as well as for the end of the interim phase of the Oslo accord.
The interim period was scheduled to end in May 1999, but was extended under the Sharm
el-Sheikh agreement in the hope that the Israeli elections would succeed where six years
of negotiations after Oslo had failed. The elections only complicated the situation
further, however, giving rise to Barak&#146;s hard-line strategy and his arrogant
miscalculation of the Palestinians&#146; patience.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The significance of these twin deadlines should not be underestimated.
Many Palestinian officials have begun to hint that the declaration of Statehood should be
deferred once again. They avoid mentioning the fact that the end of the interim phase of
the Oslo accords&#150;the provisions of which are so prejudicial to the Palestinian
people&#150;happens to fall on the same day that was set for the declaration of Statehood.
Those who advocate postponement base their arguments on the advice of the international
community, fearful of a confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis. However,
postponement also carries a price, in view of the damage it does to the credibility of the
Palestinian Authority (PA).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there are other reasons why this option should not be considered
lightly. For the Palestinian Central Council (PCC), the question of whether and when to
declare a State should be more than a tactical negotiating weapon. Statehood for the
Palestinians is a sacred goal. Over 33 years, the struggle towards this end has come to
form the lifeblood of the people, the pulse of their social and political institutions and
the inspiration behind every project down to the schools and clinics in Palestinian
villages, cities and camps. Statehood embodies the dream for independence and human
dignity, for freedom from decades of tyranny and oppression under Israeli occupation, for
the inalienable right to self-determination enjoyed by most other peoples on earth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only with Statehood will we be able to build a society unlike any that has
existed in this region. The Palestinians will be able to prove to the world that Arabs,
too, can meet the challenges of this age with dignity and honour, and create a model for a
democratic developing nation that can be emulated elsewhere. An independent State is the
only way to safeguard peace, which the Palestinian people have come to accept, despite the
injustice of the fact that a State covering all the territories occupied since 1967
represents only 22% of the original land area of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For these reasons, the PCC must absolve itself of all the obligations and
restrictions under the interim agreement that prevent the establishment of a State and
immediately begin to institutionalize the State on the ground. Practical measures, more
than a mere declaration, will assert Palestine&#146;s independence from Israel and from
all provisions of the Oslo accords that restrict the assertion of Statehood. These
measures entail putting the organic law into immediate effect, nullifying all restrictions
on the legislative process, drawing up the national constitution and setting a date for
its ratification, arranging for parliamentary elections, electing the members of the
national council, setting a date for the municipal elections and beginning negotiations
with neighbouring Arab nations over the definition of common borders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other measures will have both practical and symbolic importance. One is to
revise the taxation structure and the value-added tax, and other such taboos under the
Oslo accords. Another will be to remove the Israeli identity number from Palestinian
passports and the humiliating term &#147;travel document&#148; from their covers. A third
is for Palestinian authorities to issue building permits, particularly those that had been
suspended, both within and outside &#147;Area A,&#148; which in turn would entail opening
ministerial offices in Jerusalem. No one could accuse the Palestinians of seeking a
military confrontation with Israel if we undertook the above-mentioned actions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis must realize that the Palestinians have other options,
including the calculated precipitation of a crisis, and that we are no longer the captives
of the interim agreements. If we settle for anything less, Israeli opinion polls will
remain the terms of reference of the peace process. In the same spirit, negotiations must
be a tool to serve the struggle for our rights, rather than the struggle being a tool to
serve the Palestinian negotiating strategy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The meeting of the PCC presents the opportunity to liberate the
Palestinians from the prejudicial terms of the Oslo accords. The world will sympathize
with any constructive measures we take.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel must understand that the creation of a Palestinian State will not
remain captive to the results of negotiations. Indeed, that stance should strengthen the
Palestinian negotiating position. To drive this point home, every day from 14 September
onward should bring new practical developments in the establishment of the independent
Palestinian State, in everything from the promulgation of new laws to the construction of
new roads.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attention of the Palestinian leadership and all political forces must
focus on the domestic front. All efforts must be made to encourage popular participation
in the process of building the nation. Reforms are necessary to realize, among other
things, the appropriate implementation of the Civil Service Law and the rule of law in
general. It will also help when the people see that the leadership is actively engaged in
the actual process of building their State, not just in negotiations over the declaration
of Statehood. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ten years ago, the PLO and the Palestinian national movement were the
targets of a conspiracy to isolate and destroy them. Intensive popular action on the land
of Palestine thwarted that conspiracy and brought the PLO leadership out of its isolation.
Today, we have more powerful means at our disposal and more extensive international
sympathy than were available when the defenseless Palestinian people rose to alter the
course of history in December 1987. Still, let us remember that the path to victory begins
with the determination to win.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><b><font color="#FF0000">I want to return, therefore I am</font></b></h3>
<b><i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Known to international police as a former leader of the terrorist Stern
Gang, he became a Noble Peace Laureate after signing the Camp David Accords in September
1978. Hitherto, Menachem Begin was never recognized as a philosopher of sorts. Yet,
writing in his book, <i>The Revolt</i>, he repackaged Descartes&#146; dictum &#145;I
think, therefore I am&#146; to illustrate the true nature and essence of the Zionist
character. Hence his declaration &#145;We fight, therefore we are.&#146; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After narrowly escaping the massacre committed by Begin&#146;s Gang in his
own village, Balad el-Sheikh, in 1948, a disinherited Palestinian, Fawaz Turki, wrote
movingly of the connection between the passion for Return and his own identity. Growing up
in the camps of Beirut after the Great <i>Nakba</i> (Catastrophe), he recalled how the
struggle for return had become the bedrock upon which Palestinian existence in exile was
built. Thus he famously announced in 1977, &#145;I want to return, therefore I am.&#146;<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having spent a quarter of a century in <i>ghourba</i> (exile), Turki
concluded that it was virtually impossible for a Palestinian to be indifferent to what
happens to his people. In his remarkable article entitled, &#147;The future of a
past&#148;, he questioned how a Palestinian could claim he did not believe in the return.
It would be sheer madness because the return in the Palestinian experience is more than
territorial restitution and refugee repatriation. &#147;It is, pure and simple,
Palestinian selfhood.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two decades on, the gap between this vision of Palestinian selfhood and
its actual fulfilment remains as wide as ever. Nothing emphasized this more convincingly
than the recent Camp David summit which failed, as expected, to redress past wrongs and to
give hope for the foreseeable future. Since the whole exercise was shrouded in a blanket
of secrecy, one can only surmise that the fundamental cause for this fiasco had been
America&#146;s insistence that the Palestinians declare an end to the conflict, renounce
their national rights to Jerusalem and repatriation, and accept less than 20% of historic
Palestine with enclaves of armed Jewish settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<b>Placing carts before the horses</b><br>
In effect, the sole mediator of Middle East peace had in its supreme wisdom tabled a
proposition that positioned the carts before the horses. A plan which not only calls for a
closure of the conflict before the restoration of historic rights but worse still favours
the occupier over the occupied. Toward this end, pro-Israeli think tanks and media
machines have been cranked up to sell this latest package on offer. What is it? That
Israel would share Jerusalem with the Palestinians while retaining sovereignty therein. It
would recognize a &#147;Palestinian law of return&#148; to the West Bank and Gaza Strip
but reserve the &#145;right&#146; to decide who shall return to the Jewish State. And,
similarly, it would support a compensation scheme instead of the right of return as
enshrined in United Nations resolution 194. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Quite evidently, the Americans have decided to throw the full spotlight on
Jerusalem, with all its complexity, history and religious passion. Given its now familiar
mantra that both sides would have to make some compromises, Washington&#146;s hope is that
once some measure of recognition is granted to Palestinian aspirations in Jerusalem, it
would be easier for the PA to compromise on the refugee issue. And so, the plan aspires to
repatriate most of the refugees exiled in Lebanon to the West Bank and Gaza, naturalize
those in Jordan and Syria, and permanently close the file thereafter. This is, to all
intents and purposes, a settlement that seeks to substitute historic Palestine with a
truncated mini-State in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Palestinian right of
return with a &#147;law of return&#148; to the State of Palestine. The latter two, of
course, are not the same. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lurking dangers</b><br>
No amount of gloss or spin would render this proposal palatable to the Palestinian people.
True they demand Statehood and independence, but definitely not at the expense of other
historic national rights. Whatever the hardships and pain, they are still not ready to
dishonour the ultimate sacrifices made at Karameh, Tel el-Za&#146;ater, and Sabra and
Shatila. There are, evidently, huge costs and numerous dangers in imposing a settlement
that ignores legitimacy and seeks to brush aside 52 years of struggle. One danger is that
it would spawn a new wave of hatred, the type of which Fawaz Turki described:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In the meantime I, a Palestinian from the refugee camps who acquired
    his past in exile, hate. I hate the world I come from. I hate what has been done to it.
    What has been done in it. I hate those who are doing the doing. I hate, above all, what is
    done in its name. Robbed of my right to be, like so many other Arabs, I am reduced to
    hating, which is my only control mechanism, the only hot iron that cauterizes the poison
    of my condition, the only channel through which I can siphon off my pain and anger.&#148;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The issue at stake here is not, never was, and never will be one of local
dissent against Jewish facts on the ground. The issue is about a people exercising their
national rights in their ancestral land. The creation of a Palestinian State minus
Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return is a sure recipe for disaster. Such a
State that vaunts cosmetic political changes but preserves old economic, social and
humanitarian injustices may easily go down the same violent path that South Africa has
gone in the post-Apartheid era. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip where there is neither
truth nor reconciliation, it would be difficult to imagine the depths of violence its
society may descend into. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although they never like to hear or admit it, policy makers in Washington
are notorious for their dependency on an intelligence machinery that is incapable of
analyzing political realities in global hot spots; Viet Nam and Cuba being two outstanding
examples. Their unchecked presence in the West Bank and Gaza today is yet to confirm that
lessons have been learnt from the past. Is the White House really unaware of the critical
conditions and burgeoning arms trade in the refugee camps, or are they just hoping that
the Palestinians would soon turn their guns on each other?! If it is true that the policy
is to turn the revolutionary talent of the <i>Intifadah </i>veterans into the service of
Israel&#146;s &#147;Russian mafia&#148;, such a policy could easily backfire. Instead of
enabling Israel and the West to realize their dream of a Mediterranean free trade area
with an investment and consumer market of 700 million people, the policy may only ensure
that many more years would be spent putting out the fires of wars and building bridges of
trust, confidence and friendship. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s response to such dangers was summed up in characteristic
arrogance by Prime Minister Barak after his return from Camp David. &#147;It is time the
Palestinians learned that not all their dreams are realizable.&#148; Of course their
realizations have become much more difficult after recognition was granted to the State of
Israel before Palestinian national rights were restored. Their achievement has been
further delayed after the Israelis violated every agreement signed in the last ten years,
including Article IV of the Interim Agreement which recognizes the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as &#147;a single territorial unit.&#148; Furthermore, as long as the free movement
of Palestinians is impeded by Israeli military checkpoints, development would remain a
pipedream of the self-deluded.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Toward Palestinian selfhood </b><br>
Generally speaking, there is nothing wrong in making political errors. What is totally
abhorrent though is the unwillingness to recognize errors, learn from them, and remedy
their consequences. If the recent encounters at Camp David and its political fallout did
not verify the inadequacy of America as an impartial and honest mediator, nothing will
ever do so in the future. The clamour from every corner of the American political
establishment to move their embassy to Jerusalem in open contravention of international
law is enough to disqualify that country from supervising peace negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians. Surely if might is more important in adjudication than
honesty and integrity then America should consider employing its Mafia bosses to sit as
judges and jurors in its crime-infested cities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the aftermath of the second Camp David summit, one truth has emerged:
that a new and radical approach is needed toward peace in the Middle East. The issues at
stake here are far greater and much more important than the personal ambitions, needs and
aspirations of any single individual, party or government. To put it another way, the
history and future of a people cannot be bargained and sold as commodities on Wall Street.
Moreover, the way one people perceive another is not always as important as how that
people actually see themselves. For if the Americans and Jews still look down upon
Palestinians in the same manner as Herzl, Weizmann and Jabotinsky did in the first half of
the twentieth century, Palestinians certainly do not see themselves that way today. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Politicians influenced by such thoughts ask the Palestinians, why do you
want to return to Israel? You would never be able to realize your
&#145;Palestinian-ness&#146; in Israel. They speak as if Israel existed before Palestine;
denying the fact that Israel was carved out of and in Palestine. They ask, why would you
want to come to a country where you would not feel a sense of belonging? As if the
Palestinians are foreigners and the immigrants from Russia, the United States and Europe
are the indigenous people. Is it not time, therefore, that someone told the Zionists and
their supporters that the Palestinians are not demanding the right to return because they
want to become Israeli citizens? When they think of return they think, above all, of the
Palestine that was taken by force and illegally renamed Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even with a separate State in part or all of the West Bank and Gaza, the
Palestinians who were evicted from Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa would still want to return
to their homes. Their living and dying over the past 50 years were all for this. Few have
expressed it as beautifully as Fawaz Turki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Yes. Yes. Yes, that is where I want to return. Where I want to be.
    At the gates of Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa. And when I knock on the door, I shall be there
    listing every blade of grass, every grain of sand, every floor, every shadow of every
    olive tree that I had left behind!&#148;</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3 ALIGN="center"></font><font color="#FF0000">American Zionism -- the real problem </font><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Edward Said</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In my opinion, the role of organized Zionist groups and activities in the
United States has not been sufficiently addressed during the period of the &quot;peace
process,&quot; a neglect that I find absolutely astonishing, given that Palestinian policy
has been essentially to throw our fate as a people in the lap of the United States without
any strategic awareness of how US policy is in effect dominated, if not completely
controlled, by a small minority of people whose views about Middle East peace are in some
way more extreme than even those of the Israeli Likud.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let me give a small example. A month ago, the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz
sent over a leading columnist of theirs, Ari Shavit, to spend several days talking with
me; a good summary of this long conversation appeared as a question-and-answer interview
in the August 18 issue of the newspaper's supplement, basically uncut and uncensored. I
voiced my views very candidly, with a major emphasis on right of return, the events of
1948, and Israel's responsibility for all this. I was surprised that my views were
presented just as I voiced them, without the slightest editorializing by Shavit, whose
questions were always courteous and un-confrontational.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A week after the interview there was a response to it by Meron Benvenisti,
ex-deputy mayor of Jerusalem under Teddy Kollek. It was disgustingly personal, full of
insults and slander against me and my family. But he never denied that there was a
Palestinian people, or that we were driven out in 1948. In fact he said, we conquered
them, and why should we feel guilty? I responded to Benvenisti a week later in Ha'aretz:
What I wrote was also published uncut. I reminded Israeli readers that <br>
Benvenisti was responsible for the destruction (and probably knew about the killing of
several Palestinians) of Haret Al-Magharibah in 1967, in which several hundred
Palestinians lost their homes to Israeli bulldozers. But I did not have to remind
Benvenisti or Ha'aretz readers that as a people we existed and could at least debate our
right of return. That was taken for granted.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two points here. One is that the whole interview could not have appeared
in any American paper, and certainly not in any Jewish-American journal. And if there had
been an interview the questions to me would have been adversarial, hectoring, insulting,
such as, why have you been involved in terrorism, why will you not recognize Israel, why
was Hajj Amin a Nazi, and so on. Second, a right-wing Israeli Zionist like Benvenisti, no
matter how much he may detest me or my views, would not deny that there is a Palestinian
people which was forced to leave in 1948. An American Zionist for a long time would say
that no conquest took place or, as Joan Peters alleged in a now-disappeared and all but
forgotten 1984 book, From Time Immemorial (that won all the Jewish awards when it appeared
here), there were no Palestinians with a life in Palestine before 1948.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every Israeli will readily admit and knows perfectly well that all of
Israel was once Palestine, that (as Moshe Dayan said openly in 1976) every Israeli town or
village once had an Arab name. And Benvenisti says openly that &quot;we&quot; conquered,
and so what? Why should we feel guilty about winning? American Zionist discourse is never
straight out honest that way: it must always go round and talk about making the desert
bloom, and Israeli democracy, etc., completely avoiding the essential facts about 1948,
which every Israeli has actually lived. For the American, these are mostly fantasies, or
myths, not realities. So removed from the actualities are American supporters of Israel,
so caught in the contradictions of diasporic guilt (after all what does it mean to be a
Zionist and not emigrate to Israel?) and triumphalism as the most successful and most
powerful minority in the US, that what emerges is very often a frightening mixture of
vicarious violence against Arabs and a deep fear and hatred of them, which is the result,
unlike Israeli Jews, of not having any sustained direct contact with them.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the American Zionist, therefore, Arabs are not real beings, but
fantasies of nearly everything that can be demonized and despised, terrorism and
anti-Semitism most specially. I recently received a letter from a former student of mine,
who has had the benefit of the finest education available in the United States: he can
still bring himself to ask me in all honesty and courtesy why as a Palestinian I let a
Nazi like Hajj Amin still determine my political agenda. &quot;Before Hajj Amin,&quot; he
argued, &quot;Jerusalem wasn't important to Arabs. Because he was so evil he made it an
important issue for Arabs just in order to frustrate Zionist aspirations which always held
Jerusalem to be important.&quot; This is not the logic of someone who has lived with and
knows something concrete about Arabs. It is that of a person who speaks an organized
discourse and is driven by an ideology that regards Arabs only as negative functions, as
the embodiment of violent anti-Semitic violent passions. As such, therefore, they are to
be fought against and if possible disposed of. Not for nothing was Dr Baruch Goldstein,
the appalling murderer of 29 Palestinians who were quietly praying in the Hebron mosque,
an American, as was Rabbi Meir Kahane. Far from being aberrations that have embarrassed
their followers, both Kahane and Goldstein are revered today by others like them. Many of
the most zealous far-right settlers sitting on Palestinian land, remorselessly speaking
about &quot;the land of Israel&quot; as being theirs, hating and ignoring the Palestinian
owners and residents all round them, are also American-born. To see them walking through
the streets of Hebron as if the Arab city was entirely theirs is a frightening sight,
aggravated by the defiance and contempt they display openly against the Arab majority.
&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I bring all this up here to make one essential point. When after the Gulf
War the PLO took the strategic decision -- already settled on by two major Arab countries
before the PLO -- to work with the American government and if possible with the powerful
lobby that controls discussion of Middle Eastern politics, they had made the decision (as
had the two Arab states before them) on the basis of vast ignorance and quite
extraordinarily mistaken assumptions. <br>
The idea, as it was expressed to me shortly after 1967 by a senior Arab diplomat, was to
surrender in effect, and say, we are not going to struggle any more. We are now willing to
accept Israel and also to accept the US's determining role in our future. There were
objective reasons for such a view at the time, as there are now, as to why continuing the
fight as the Arabs had done historically would lead to further defeat and even disaster.
But I firmly believe that it was a mistaken policy simply to throw Arab policy into the
lap of the US and, since the major Zionist organizations are so influential everywhere in
the United States, into their lap as well, saying, in effect, we won't fight you, let us
join you, but please treat us well. The hope was that if we conceded and said, we are not
your enemies, as Arabs we would become their friends.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The problem is with the disparity in power that remained. From the
viewpoint of the powerful, what difference does it make to your own strategy if your weak
adversary gives up and says I have nothing further to fight for, take me, I want to be
your ally, just try to understand me a bit better and then perhaps you will then be
fairer? A good way of answering this question in practical and concrete terms is to look
at the latest turn of events in New York's senatorial race, where Hillary Clinton is
competing with Republican Ric Lazio for the seat now held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D),
who is retiring. Last year Hillary said that she favored the establishment of a
Palestinian state and, on a formal visit to Gaza with her husband, embraced Soha Arafat.
Since entering the senatorial race in New Yorshe has outdone even the most right-wing
Zionists in her fervour for Israel and opposition to Palestine, even going so far as to
advocate moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and (more extreme) advocating
leniency for Jonathan Pollard, the Israeli spy convicted for espionage against the US and
now serving a life sentence. Her Republican antagonists have tried to embarrass her by
depicting her as an &quot;Arab-lover&quot; and by releasing a photograph of her actually
embracing Soha. Since New York is the citadel of Zionist power, attacking someone with
such labels as &quot;Arab-lover&quot; and &quot;friend of Soha Arafat&quot; is tantamount
to the worst possible insult. All this despite the fact that Arafat and the PLO are openly
declared American allies, recipients of US military and financial aid, and in the security
field the beneficiaries of CIA security support. In the meantime, the White House released
a photo of Lazio shaking hands two years ago with Arafat. One blow clearly deserves
another.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The real fact is that Zionist discourse is a discourse of power, and Arabs
in that discourse are the objects of power -- despised objects at that. Having thrown in
their lot with this power as its surrendered former antagonist, they can never expect to
be on equal terms with it. Hence the degrading and insulting spectacle of Arafat (always
and forever the symbol of enmity to the Zionist mind) being used in an entirely local
contest in the US between two opponents who are trying to prove who of the two is the most
pro-Israeli. And neither Hillary Clinton nor Ric Lazio is even Jewish.&nbsp; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What I shall discuss in my next article is how the only possible political
strategy for the US so far as Arab and Palestinian policy are concerned is neither a pact
with the Zionists here nor one with US policy, but a mobilized mass campaign directed at
the American population on behalf of Palestinian human, civil and political rights. All
other arrangements, whether Oslo or Camp David, are doomed to failure because, put simply,
the official discourse is totally dominated by Zionism and, except for a few individual
exceptions, no alternatives to it exist. Therefore all peace arrangements undertaken on
the basis of an alliance with the US are alliances that confirm rather than confront
Zionist power. To submit supinely to a Zionist-controlled Middle East policy, as the Arabs
have done for almost a generation now, will neither bring stability at home nor equality
and justice in the US.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yet the irony is that there exists inside the US a vast body of opinion ready to be
critical both of Israel and of US foreign policy. The tragedy is that the Arabs are too
weak, too divided, too disorganized and ignorant to take advantage of it. I shall discuss
the reasons for that as well in my next article since my hope is to try to reach a new
generation that may be both puzzled and discouraged by the miserable, denigrated place in
which our culture and people are now located, and the constant sense of indignant but
humiliating loss that all of us experience as a result.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Why are we panicking?</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Musil Shehadeh</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Any peace process that does not address the wrongs of the past is doomed
to total failure, especially when one party is still suffering until today from such past
evils. If international legality and moral standards are not solicited and used as basic
criteria for such a peace process, then the entire negotiations would turn into a farce.
It&#146;s no wonder that Camp David II, as predicted, ended as a devastating failure. The
arrogant Israeli position in such negotiations falls within a framework that would demand
that the Palestinians would legitimize what Israel has already taken and annexed by the
use of force, while negotiating with the Palestinians on what was left. This Israeli
chutzpah is further exposed when it demands certain Palestinian concessions, or rewards,
for such a &#147;philanthropic&#148; attitude!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To interpret such a position on the ground, Israel demands that a sizable
part of the already shrinking West Bank be annexed to the ever-expanding Zionist State
under the mantra of protecting its own people and settlements, while rejecting all pleas
and international resolutions concerning the rights of the Palestinian refugees to return,
keeping Jerusalem &#147;united&#148; under its full control, demilitarizing the so-called
future Palestinian State, and then demanding that the real protagonists recognize and
legitimize all such robberies in the name of a signed peace treaty! In other words, Israel
would achieve a lot more under this American-sponsored peace treaty than under a previous
violent status quo.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Knowing Israel&#146;s ongoing expansion policies, such demands should not
surprise anyone, especially when we realize that in any negotiations the strong would
always dictate its terms to the weak. If the weak happens to be desperate for an
agreement, any agreement, then it would surprise no one that peace under such
circumstances would become a farce. How can a refugee understand that a Palestinian peace
would not give him the right of return, and that his newly formed &#147;State&#148; is
nothing more than a dissected collection of ghettoes that have no relation to a viable
State, and that his Jerusalem would remain under the control of the occupier? In his
desperate attempts to sign a peace treaty, Mr. Arafat, has already crossed the red lines,
which represent the minimal needs of the Palestinians. By doing that, a signed peace
treaty will not be worth the paper it was written on or the efforts that were used to
reach such a false objective. Mr. Arafat cannot sign anything that would compromise
certain minimal requirements that are needed for a viable peace, and if he does, then such
peace would never be acceptable to the mainstream Palestinians in the world today. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The question that many Palestinians are asking is why the panic? Why are
we so desperate to sign any peace knowing that it would not meet the minimal needs of a
viable State or the refugees&#146; right to return while sacrificing Jerusalem in the
process? Of course, the present Palestinian leadership would hasten to respond that there
are no other alternatives. Aren&#146;t there? After such a long and maybe costly struggle,
it has been established that our people hold the strong card for war and peace in the
entire region. What can Israel do that it has not done already? Build more settlements?
Annex the West Bank? We have to understand Zionist ideology before we come to certain
terms with future actions. Israel cannot annex the West Bank except to its own detriment
and demise. Jewish exclusivity has been the holy and unwavering goal of the Zionist State.
To annex the occupied territory would be a fatal and final blow to such a goal. Even by
Israeli declared laws, such annexation would add unwanted non-Jewish populace into its own
proper. This would result in diluting the Jewish exclusivity of Israel and add more Arab
representatives to the decision makers in the Knesset and thus start the beginning of the
end of the Jewish State. It&#146;s precisely this future and undesired scenario which
prohibited Israel from annexing the West Bank since 1967, and not out of fear of the
Arabs, international legality or moral standards. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A simple statistical calculation of the Israeli-Arab growth in Israel over
the last 50 years shows that the Palestinians have increased eightfold (from approximately
150,000 to the present 1.2 million). Such a ticking demographic bomb will explode in the
next generation right in the midst of Jewish exclusivity and shatter its foundation. In
other words, if we are to leave things to nature alone, the Palestinians would catch up
with the Jewish population in the next 30 or so years, and it would not be far-fetched
then if 50% of the Knesset members would turn out to be of Palestinian origin. If Israel
followed the ideas espoused by Sharon or Netanyahu to annex the entire West Bank, it would
hasten drastically the turning of the Knesset into an Arab majority within the next ten
years. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians, with their obvious weakness notwithstanding, hold the
real key to war and peace in the area, and no one would ever entertain the idea that peace
along Israeli terms and conditions would remain viable until the real protagonists give
their own blessings to the legitimacy of the Jews. Without them, Israeli legitimacy would
remain unfulfilled, and it would never become an accepted member in the Middle East
community, as no Arab country would recognize and normalize their relations with the
oppressive Zionist entity without recognizing the Palestinian national rights. The
Palestinians also hold the strong position of being the only bridge that would allow the
Israelis to cross over into the Arab and Muslim worlds, instead of remaining an isolated
castle in the midst of a hostile environment. Israel cannot claim to be the safe haven for
Jews all over the world without the implied blessings of the Palestinians through such a
signed peace. Without peace, the Israeli-Arab demographic bomb is ticking toward the
drastic reduction of Jewish exclusivity in Israel, turning the State into a bi-national
State, which has been the early objective of the PLO since its appearance on the world
scene. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe that for the first time since the Arab-Israel conflict, time is
not necessarily on the side of Israel, and I cannot see any reasons to panic into signing
such a humiliating peace agreement with Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians should stand firm in their legitimate demands and should
never succumb to any pressure that would force them to legitimize the Zionist robbery of
their homeland. The PA should reject all peace processes that fall short of actuating
their national objectives of a free and independent Palestine with full sovereignty over
their homeland. The right of return should not be an issue of negotiation, nor should it
become an object of a public referendum, but rather an issue of implementation in
conformity with UN resolutions, especially resolution 194. To achieve a solid front, the
Palestinian leadership should unite all the different Palestinian factions to face the
Zionist hegemony over our homeland. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It could be argued that all negotiations require some degree of
flexibility, possibly, but I cannot see that such an attitude must prevail when we deal
with our national aspirations of a fully independent Palestinian State in our homeland
with full restitution of all our rights, including the right of return. No one, including
Mr. Arafat, has the authority to compromise our rights to our homeland, and all efforts in
this direction are doomed to failure. Meanwhile, we should not wait for a miracle to solve
our problem, as all means should be used to achieve such objectives without excluding the
right to use armed struggle. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The ongoing struggle of &#147;Israeli Arabs&#148;
</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the rise of every new day&#146;s sun, the Palestinian residents of
Israel prove that their identity is not as divided as some may think, nor has their
&#147;integration&#148; into the Israeli society left them with multiple allegiances and a
sense of &#147;loyalty schizophrenia&#148;. It is not Israeli research and census bureau
studies that determine the &#147;Israeli Arabs&#146;&#148; stand on the political map of
the Middle East, but it is the daily assurances of the one million Palestinians who have
remained unmoved from historical Palestine which shapes and stubbornly refuses all
attempts to undermine its struggle for recognition and equal civil rights. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The 1948 war and the establishment of an Israeli State over occupied
Palestinian land resulted in much more than the expulsion of Palestinian refugees to the
West Bank, Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries. It also brought about a tragic new
reality to those Palestinians who remained. The establishment of Israel created refugees
within historical Palestine, inflicted discrimination, military administration and an
iron-fist policy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1966, the Israeli military administration was abolished, and the
remaining Palestinian communities within Israel were supposedly integrated into
Israel&#146;s economic, social and political arena. But in reality, such integration has
failed to actualize, not only through statistics and numbers, but also through
Israel&#146;s perception of its Arab population and through this population&#146;s
perception of itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the same way Israel&#146;s government has long denied the existence of
such a nation called Palestine, it has also denied the existence of a large segment of the
Arab population within Israel, by denying the existence of their homes and villages. The
90,000 residents of 176 unrecognized Arab villages, also known as &#147;phantom
villages&#148;, are a loud reminder of Israel&#146;s disregard for even the most basic of
human rights, even for those who are supposedly its own citizens. Those living in these
phantom villages have no rights today, as they have never had for over the past five
decades. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The rest of Israel&#146;s Arab population escaped the tragic fate of those
who belonged to these unrecognized villages, they too had their own
&#147;unrecognized&#148; rights and privileges. It is difficult enough for &#147;Israeli
Arabs&#148; to live in a country that was built on the ruins of their own land, but
Israel&#146;s insistence on its Jewishness and its routine persecution of Palestinians in
the nearby West Bank and Gaza Strip was very poor incentive for &#147;Israeli Arabs&#148;
to feel like citizens of Israel, with equal rights and equal responsibilities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewishness of Israel reflected direct discrimination against the
mainly Muslim and Christian Arab population. Systematic Israeli discrimination resulted in
a near complete confiscation of Arab Israelis&#146; land, under-funded public facilities,
house demolitions, job and religious discrimination, and more. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Decades of living in Israel has not converted Palestinians into loyal
Israelis. To the contrary, Israel&#146;s oppression of its one million Arabs pushed
&#147;Israeli Arabs&#148; to cling to who they really are: Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With every Land Day (Israel&#146;s Independence Day), or with any other
occasion that symbolizes Palestinian pride or Israeli oppression, &#147;Israeli
Arabs&#148; take to the streets, waving Palestinian flags, chanting in Arabic, and
confirming their Arab identity. As angrily, brutally and inhumanly as Israeli soldiers
crack down on protestors in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli police interfere, to
put down the protests of the &#147;Israeli Arab&#148; population in Nazareth or Kfar Kana.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian tragedy remains unsolved. Indications of its continuation
are highlighted in the slums of Gaza and desperate refugee camps in South Lebanon. We
ought to remember, however, that the tragedy which first began in historical Palestine in
1948 never came to a close there either. It continues, intensifies and spreads. Houses in
unrecognized Arab villages continue to be demolished. Their owners and the entire village
protest with each demolition, and injured and beaten villagers fall in anger and despair.
Dozens of &#147;Arab Israelis&#148; were wounded in the last Israeli Independence Day
celebration, as is the case on almost every Independence Day; 70,000 &#147;Israeli
Arabs&#148; gathered on 15 September to confirm their commitment to the Aqsa Mosque and to
the Palestinian struggle as a whole. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kfar Kasim elementary school students march to school where an Israeli
flag hangs. Covering the walls inside the poorly funded school are 49 photos bearing the
beautiful faces of 49 villagers from the village of Kfar Kasim who were savagely massacred
by Israeli soldiers in 1956. The faces, the memories they carry, the killing of many more,
the demolished houses, the unrecognized villages, the gathering of thousands in support of
Palestinian rights in Jerusalem and many more great and simple signs scream with an
undeniable truth: the &#147;Israeli Arabs&#148; are first and foremost part of the
unfolding Palestinian story, the tragedy. &#147;Israeli Arabs&#148; are by no means living
with a &#147;divided identity&#148;; they are simply Palestinians who, like all other
Palestinians, were denied their identity. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Quest for Justice</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Judith Stone</i></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am a Jew. I was a participant in the rally for the Right of Return to
Palestine. It was the right thing to do. I&#146;ve heard about the European holocaust
against the Jews since I was a small child. I&#146;ve visited the memorials in Washington,
DC and Jerusalem dedicated to Jewish lives lost, and I&#146;ve cried at the recognition to
what level of atrocity mankind is capable of sinking. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Where are the Jews of conscience? No righteous malice can be held against
the survivors of Hitler&#146;s holocaust. These fragments of humanity were in no position
to make choices beyond that of personal survival. We must not forget that being a survivor
or a co-religionist of the victims of the European holocaust does not grant dispensation
from abiding by the rules of humanity. &#147;Never again&#148; as a motto rings hollow
when it means &#147;never again to us alone.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My generation was raised being led to believe that the biblical land was a
vast desert inhabited by a handful of impoverished Palestinians living with their camels
and eking out a living in the sand. The arrival of the Jews was touted as a tremendous
benefit to these desert dwellers. Golda Mier even assured us that there &#147;is no
Palestinian problem.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We know now this picture wasn&#146;t as it was painted. Palestine was a
land filled with people who called it home. There were thriving towns and villages,
schools and hospitals. There were Jews, Christians and Muslims. In fact, prior to the
occupation, Jews represented a mere 7% of the population and owned only 3% of the land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Taking the blinders off for a moment, I see a second atrocity perpetuated
by the very people who should be exquisitely sensitive to the suffering of others. These
people knew what it felt like to be ordered out of their homes at gunpoint and forced to
march into the night to unknown destinations or face execution on the spot. The people who
displaced the Palestinians knew firsthand what it meant to watch your home go up in
flames, to surrender everything dear to your heart at a moment&#146;s notice. Bulldozers
leveled hundreds of villages, along with the remains of the village inhabitants, the old
and the young. This was nothing new to the world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Poland is a vast graveyard of the Jews of Europe. Israel is the final
resting place of the massacred Palestinian people. A short distance from the memorial to
the Jewish children lost to the holocaust in Europe, there is a leveled parking lot. Under
this parking lot is what&#146;s left of a once-flourishing village and the bodies of men,
women and children whose only crime was taking up needed space and not leaving graciously.
This particular burial marker reads: Public Parking. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I&#146;ve talked with Palestinians. I have yet to meet a Palestinian who
hasn&#146;t lost a member of their family to the Israeli Shoah, nor a Palestinian who
cannot name a relative or friend languishing under inhumane conditions in an Israeli
prison. Time and time again, Israel is cited for human rights violations to no avail. On a
recent trip to Israel, I visited the refugee camps inhabited by a people who have waited
52 years in these &#147;temporary&#148; camps to go home. Every Palestinian grandparent
can tell you the name of their village, their street and where the olive trees were
planted. Their grandchildren may never have been home, but they can tell you where their
great-grandfather lies buried and where the village well stood. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The press has fostered the portrait of the Palestinian terrorist. But, the
victims who rose up against human indignity in the Warsaw Ghetto are called heroes. Those
who lost their lives are called martyrs. The Palestinian who tosses a rock in desperation
is a terrorist. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two years ago I drove through Palestine and watched intricate sprinkler
systems watering lush green lawns of Zionist settlers in their new condominium complexes,
surrounded by armed guards and barbed wire in the midst of a Palestinian community where
there was not adequate water to drink and the surrounding fields were sandy and dry.
University professor Moshe Zimmerman reported in the <i>Jerusalem Post</i> (30 April
1995), &#147;The [Jewish] children of Hebron are just like Hitler&#146;s youth.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We Jews are suing for restitution, lost wages, compensation for homes,
land, slave labour and back wages in Europe. Am I a traitor of a Jew for supporting the
right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their birthplace and compensation for what
was taken that cannot be returned? The Jewish dead cannot be brought back to life and
neither can the Palestinian massacred be resurrected.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">David Ben Gurion said, &#147;Let us not ignore the truth among
ourselves...politically, we are the aggressors and they defend themselves...The country is
theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in
their view we want to take away from them their country...&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestine is a land that has been occupied and emptied of its people.
It&#146;s cultural and physical landmarks have been obliterated and replaced by tidy
Hebrew signs. The history of a people was the first thing eradicated by the occupiers. The
history of the indigenous people (only 52 years old) has been all but eradicated as though
they never existed. And all this has been hailed by the world as a miraculous act of God. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We must recognize that Israel&#146;s existence is not even a question of
legality so much as it is an illegal <i>fait accompli</i> realized through the use of
force while supported by the Western powers. The United Nations missions directed at
Israel in attempting to correct its violations have thus far been futile. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hertzl&#146;s &#147;The Jewish State&#148;, the father of Zionism said,
&#147;...We must investigate and take possession of the new Jewish country by means of
every modern expedient.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I guess I agree with Ehud Barak (3 June 1998) when he said, &#147;If I
were a Palestinian, I&#146;d also join a terrorist group.&#148; I&#146;d go a step
further, perhaps. Rather than throwing little stones in desperation, I&#146;d hurl a
boulder. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hopefully, somewhere deep inside, every Jew of conscience knows that this
was no war; that this was not God&#146;s restitution of the holy land to it&#146;s
rightful owners. We know that a human atrocity was and continues to be perpetuated against
an innocent people who couldn&#146;t come up with the arms and money to defend themselves
against the Western powers bent upon their demise as a people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We cannot continue to say, &#147;But what were we to do?&#148; Zionism is
not synonymous with Judaism. I wholly support the rally of the Right of Return of the
Palestinian people. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Issue of Jerusalem</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>E. Yaghi</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That less than 50% of Palestinian land is left to the Palestinian people
seems not to be an issue with those who have been condemning Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat&#146;s reluctance to cede any more of East Jerusalem to the Israelis. What has been
all too easily overlooked and indeed forgotten is that until 1948, Jerusalem and the whole
of Palestine was Palestinian.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now things have sadly come to the point where U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak have urged Mr. Arafat to be more
&#147;realistic&#148; about what the Palestinians could and could not have. President Bill
Clinton even threatened to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Such a move would
legitimize the Holy City as Israel&#146;s capital as far as the American government is
concerned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Americans backed a compromise that would have granted the Palestinians
sovereignty over some but not all of East Jerusalem. Why should the Palestinians have to
compromise any of Jerusalem at all, and in particular East Jerusalem? Is it not enough
that the Palestinians have been deprived of most of their land and that they have no
political rights whatsoever? Even though all along successive Israeli governments have
become more hostile, more intransigent than ever before, the Palestinians themselves have
become more moderate in hopes of finding some kind of peace on what is left of their own
land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Somehow in Western and Israeli media, the Palestinians are depicted as
terrorist outsiders on their own land while the Israelis are depicted as innocent and
peace-loving people trying to impede the aggression of invading hoards of Palestinians who
are trying to conquer Israel from some kind of mythical place invented in the minds of the
ignorant. What is really happening is that the remainder of what is left of Palestine has
been divided into two huge concentration camps with Israeli settlements sporadically
cropping up in patches everywhere on the outskirts of these camps.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even the few Israelis who pretend to know and love the Palestinians and
are concerned for their plight act as if such camps are the rightful places for these
refugees who were forced out of their own orange groves and fertile lands to such desolate
places as the Gaza Strip. Such people might bemoan the inhumane treatment of how Israelis
torture Palestinians, how they imprison them without trial, how they blow up homes for no
reason and how many Palestinian innocents they have brutally killed, but it is easy to
sympathize with these victims as long as the issues are not pursued any further. Imagine a
peace-loving Israeli suggesting that all the Jews who are illegal occupants of Palestinian
land go back to their own former countries! Palestine was never Israeli. But it has been
Palestinian for over 2,000 years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is now time for the Israelis who are the real impostors, the real
killers, the real thieves, to make concessions. What have they really got to lose? They
have gained the country, the territory, the cities of another people. They have taken away
a culture, the customs, the education and the dignity of the indigenous inhabitants of
Palestine. Isn&#146;t that enough?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the very least, East Jerusalem should not be further divided. The
Palestinians should have sole sovereignty over their own city and should not be condemned
for doing so. It is not Yasser Arafat who should be blamed for the collapse of the peace
talks in July, but rather the Israelis themselves and their cohorts the Americans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We live in an age where black is called white and evil is portrayed as
good. We live in an age where the Tarik Ben Ziyads are hung by those who erroneously write
history with Palestinian blood as the ink. As for the Arab leaders, they are complacently
content to sell whatever is left of Palestine and Jerusalem so they can grow fatter, more
corrupt and more tyrannical. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The issue of Jerusalem is not a matter of the Palestinians ceding more of
their land to their usurpers, but for the world&#150;for once&#150;to be more realistic
about what is right, just and fair. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The importance of the American <br>
presidential elections to the world</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Fatima Hamilton</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Someone living in the Middle East or China or even on a small island may
wonder why the American presidential elections are important to them. The elections are
very important. When there is change in America, it affects the whole world. America is
the &#147;Roman Empire&#148; of today, and it sets the pace for the rest of the world. It
is the superpower that can make or break the life of another country. So, we should pay
close attention to the upcoming elections in November. Whoever becomes the next president
will affect the Palestinian peace process, the future of Jerusalem, the situation in Iraq
and every aspect of the Middle East as well as the rest of the world. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>There are two main candidates&#150;Republican George W. Bush (son
of the former President Bush) and Democrat Al Gore (the current Vice-President). We have
two other candidates running as Independents that are of some importance&#150;Pat Buchanan
from the Reform Party (a past Republican) and Ralph Nader from the Green Party. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>How could each affect our lives? Only Allah knows for sure, but
Americans as well as worldwide citizens must be concerned. At stake is not only Jerusalem
but also issues that affect Americans such as education, healthcare, racism,
discrimination (which many Arab-Americans and Muslims of all nationalities there have
felt), police profiling and so many other issues that affect the daily lives of Arabs and
Muslims living in America as well as outside of America. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>So, American Muslims must choose the most fair, most just candidate
who would work for minority and Muslim rights. Still, women are discriminated against at
work for wearing hijab (Islamic dress) and mosques sometimes suffer from vandalism and
bombings in America. Many Muslims who are innocent and uncharged are in prison. So, voters
should work to change these things. They need to choose a new candidate who would protect
the civil rights and religious freedom of all peoples&#150;the ideal of the American
Constitution. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The Democrats are supposed to be for the rights of the minority and
the &#147;oppressed&#148;, but sometimes they do little to really help these groups. Yes,
President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton hosted an iftar (a meal to
break fast) during a couple of Ramadans at the White House for some Muslims. They were the
first to ever do this, so this is an accomplishment. However, little else has been done to
secure Muslim rights and liberties. Maybe they did this to keep the potential voters
happy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al Gore and George W. Bush both support the move of the U.S. Embassy from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (How can they even announce such a thing while the status of
Jerusalem is still in question? This proves they are biased&#150;in favour of the Israeli
position.) They both support Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Whereas, Pat Buchanan
stated at a meeting he had with the American Muslim Council that Jerusalem should be the
capital of both Palestine and Israel. (At least he&#146;s being fairer). It&#146;s not
clear what Ralph Nader&#146;s view is, but being of Lebanese descent (whether Christian or
Muslim) as well as being a social advocate, I don&#146;t believe he&#146;d sell out
Jerusalem and would try to be fair. Nader has a history of working for minorities and
oppressed people, and he has worked hard for social justice in America. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Who&#146;s the best candidate? Well, both Al Gore and George W.
Bush speak eloquently, but would they perform well in the office of President? People say
anything to win an election. Republicans, in general, have never stood up for minorities,
especially for Muslims. They overlook Muslims in America as if they don&#146;t exist even
though they number in the millions. Yet, this year&#146;s campaigning showed the
Republicans parading minorities and disabled people left and right to represent the
Republican Party. The Republican Party is showing Democratic characteristics while
Democrats have been taking on some Republican characteristics. Is this just to win the
elections? Just give the people what they want to hear whether you mean it or not? A voter
must go back to the past and examine Republican and Democratic behaviour and views to know
how these candidates may really perform after they get into office. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>One must also examine their Vice-Presidential candidates who in the
event of some misfortune that might occur to the President would then become the
President. They are important, too. Dick Cheney, who&#146;s running with Bush, is a former
Defense Minister, so he may be more war-oriented. (There goes peace.) Joe Lieberman, a
practicing Jew, is running with Gore. This would affect the peace process greatly as well
as the issue of Jerusalem. Personally, I respect the fact that Lieberman is a moral guy,
rare in Washington these days, but I fear he will not be fair in dealing as a mediator
(even as a Vice-President who would influence the President) of the peace process. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Buchanan would try to be fair, but he actually prefers to
concentrate on domestic issues rather than foreign policy. He wants to reform and rebuild
a strong America. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>In my opinion, Ralph Nader is probably the best hope America has;
he would work for justice for all&#150;both in America and around the world. He has a
degree in law, and he has written many books and done many studies that helped to
influence policy makers in Washington over the years. He has worked towards safety and
regulations for the good of the public. He seems to be sincere and seems to really care

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Regarding the non-Jew, the Lubovitcher Rebbe's views were clear even if a
bit disorderly: &quot;In such a manner the Halacha, stipulated by the Talmud, showed that
a non-Jew should be punished by death if he kills an embryo, even if the embryo is
non-Jewish, while the Jew should not be, even if the embryo is Jewish. As we [the talmudic
sages] learn from Exodus 22:21, beginning with the words 'and if any mischief will
follow.&quot;' This quoted verse is a part of a passage beginning in verse 21, describing
what should be done &quot;if men strive and hurt a woman with child,&quot; thus damaging
the embryo. Verse 22, whose beginning is quoted by the Lubovitcher Rebbe, says in full:
&quot;And if any mischief will follow, then you shall give soul for soul.&quot; (Some
English translations use the wording &quot;life for life&quot; instead of &quot;soul for
soul.&quot;) The above stated difference in the punishment of a Jew and a non-Jew for the
same crime is common in the Talmud and Halacha.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Lubovitcher Rebbe continued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person stems from the
  common expression: &quot;Let us differentiate.&quot; Thus, we do not have a case of
  profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level. Rather, we have a case of
  &quot;let us differentiate&quot; between totally different species. This is what needs to
  be said about the body: the body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from
  the body of [members] of all nations of the world ... The Old Rabbi [a pseudonym for one
  of the holy Lubovitch rabbis] explained that the passage in Chapter 49 of <i>Hatanya </i>[the
  basic book of Chabad]: &quot;And you have chosen us&quot; [the Jews] means specifically
  that the Jewish body was chosen [by God], because a choice is thus made between outwardly
  similar things. The Jewish body &quot;looks as if it were in substance similar to bodies
  of non-Jews,&quot; but the meaning ... is that the bodies only seem to be similar in
  material substance, outward look and superficial quality. The difference of the inner
  quality, however, is so great that the bodies should be considered as completely different
  species. This is the reason why the Talmud states that there is an halachic difference in
  attitude about the bodies of non-Jews [as opposed to the bodies of Jews]&quot; &quot;their
  bodies are in vain. ... An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul. Two
  contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while
  the Jewish soul stems from holiness.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">As has been explained, an embryo is called a human being, because it has
  both body and soul. Thus, the difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish embryo can be
  understood. There is also a difference in bodies. The body of a Jewish embryo is on a
  higher level than is the body of a non-Jew. This is expressed in the phrase &quot;let us
  differentiate&quot; about the body of a non-Jew, which is a totally different kind. The
  same difference exists in regard to the soul: the soul of a Jewish embryo is different
  than the soul of a non-Jewish embryo. We therefore ask: Why should a non-Jew be punished
  if he kills even a non-Jewish embryo while a Jew should not be punished even if he kills a
  Jewish embryo? The answer can be understood by [considering] the general difference
  between Jews and non-Jews: A Jew was not created as a means for some [other] purpose; he
  himself is the purpose, since the substance of all [divine] emanations was created only to
  serve the Jews. &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot;
  [Genesis 1:1] means that [the heavens and the earth] were created for the sake of the
  Jews, who are called the &quot;beginning.&quot; This means everything, all developments,
  all discoveries, the creation, including the &#147;heavens and the earth- are vanity
  compared to the Jews. The important things are the Jews, because they do not exist for any
  [other] aim; they themselves are [the divine] aim.&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After some additional cabbalistic explanation the Lubovitcher Rebbe
concluded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Following from what has already been said, it can be understood why a
  non-Jew should be punished by death if he kills an embryo and why a Jew should not be
  punished by death. The difference between the embryo and a [baby that was] born is that
  the embryo is not a self-contained reality but rather is subsidiary; either it is
  subsidiary to its mother or to the reality created after birth when the [divine] purpose
  of its creation is then fulfilled. In its present state the purpose is still absent. A
  non-Jew's entire reality is only vanity. It is written, &quot;And the strangers shall
  stand and feed your flocks&quot; [Isaiah 61: 5]. The entire creation [of a non-Jew] exists
  only for the sake of the Jews. Because of this a non-Jew should be punished with death if
  he kills an embryo, while a Jew, whose existence is most important, should not be punished
  with death because of something subsidiary. We should not destroy an important thing for
  the sake of something subsidiary. It is true that there is a prohibition against [hurting]
  an embryo, because it is something that will be born in the future and in a hidden form
  already exists. The death penalty should be implicated only when visible matters are
  affected; as previously noted, the embryo is merely of subsidiary importance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Comments concerning and partial summaries of the above opinions have
appeared, but with insufficient emphasis in the Israeli Hebrew press. In 1965, when the
above was published, the Lubovitcher Rebbe was allied in Israel to the Labor Party; his
movement had already acquired many important benefits from the government then in power as
well as previous Israeli governments. The Lubovitchers, for example, had obtained autonomy
for their own education system within the context of religious state education. In the
mid-1970s the Lubovitcher Rebbe decided that the Labor Party was too moderate and
thereafter shifted his movement's political support sometimes to Likud and sometimes to a
religious party. Ariel Sharon was the Rebbe's favorite Israeli senior politician. Sharon
in turn praised the Rebbe publicly and delivered a moving speech about him in the Knesset
after the Rebbe's death. From the June 1967 war until his death the Lubovitcher Rebbe
always supported Israeli wars and opposed any retreat. In 1974 he strongly opposed the
Israeli withdrawal from the Suez area, conquered in the October 1973 war; he promised
Israel divine favors if it persisted in occupying that land. After his death thousands of
his Israeli followers, who continued to hold the views expressed in the above quoted
passage, played an important role in Netanyahu's election victory by demonstrating at many
cross-road junctions before election day; they chanted the slogan: &#147;Netanyahu is good
for the Jews.&#148; Although subsequently strongly criticizing Netanyahu for meeting with
Arafat, signing the Hebron agreement and agreeing to a second withdrawal, the Rebbe's
followers continued their overall preference for the Netanyahu government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the religious settlers in the Occupied Territories the Chabad
Hassids constitute one of the most extreme groups. Baruch Goldstein, the mass murderer of
Palestinians, was one of them. Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburgh, who wrote a chapter of a book in
praise of Goldstein and what he did, is another member of their group. Ginsburgh is the
former head of the Yoseph Tomb Yeshiva, located on the outskirts of Nablus. Rabbi
Ginsburgh, who originally came to Israel from the United States and has good connection to
the Lubovitcher community in the United States, has often expressed his views in English
in American Jewish publications. The following appeared in an April 26,1996 <i>Jewish Week
</i>(New York) article that contained an interview with Rabbi Ginsburgh:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Regarded as one of the Lubovitcher sect's leading authorities on Jewish
  mysticism, the St. Louis born rabbi, who also has a graduate degree in mathematics, speaks
  freely of Jews' genetic-based, spiritual superiority over non-Jews. It is a superiority
  that he asserts invests Jewish life with greater value in the eyes of the Torah. &quot;If
  you saw two people drowning, a Jew and a non-Jew, the Torah says you save the Jewish life
  first,&quot; Rabbi Ginsburgh told the <i>Jewish Week </i>&quot;If every simple cell in a
  Jewish body entails divinity, is a part of God, then every strand of DNA is part of God.
  Therefore, something is special about Jewish DNA.&quot; Later, Rabbi Ginsburgh asked
  rhetorically: &quot;If a Jew needs a liver, can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew
  passing by to save him? The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite
  value,&quot; he explained. &quot;There is something infinitely more holy and unique about
  Jewish life than non-Jewish life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Changing the words ''Jewish&quot; to &#147;German&#148; or
&#147;Aryan&#148; and &quot;non-Jewish&quot; to &quot;Jewish&quot; turns the Ginsburgh
position into the doctrine that made Auschwitz possible in the past. To a considerable
extent the German Nazi success depended upon that ideology and upon its implications not
being widely known early. Disregarding even on a limited scale the potential effects of
messianic, Lubovitch and other ideologies could prove to be calamitous.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The difference in the attitudes about non-Jews in the Halacha and the
Cabbala is well illustrated by the difference expressed specifically in regard to non-Jews
who have converted to Judaism. The Halacha, although discriminating against them in some
ways, treats converts as new Jews. The Cabbala is unable to adopt this approach because of
its emphasis upon the cosmic difference between Jews and non-Jews. The Cabbala explains
that converts are really Jewish souls consigned firstly to non-Jewish bodies as
punishments and later redeemed by conversion to Judaism either because the punishment
ended or because a holy man interceded. This explanation is part of cabbalistic belief in
metempsychosis, which is absent in the Halacha. According to the Cabbala, a satanic soul
cannot be transformed into a divine soul by mere persuasion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ensuing discussion of Gush Emunim ideas and politics takes cognizance
of the Lustick and Harkabi studies but relies primarily upon primary source material and
upon analyses by Tal and other Hebrew-language writers. Tal described and analyzed Gush
Emunim principles by quoting extensively from writings of Rabbi Yehuda Amital, an
outstanding Gush leader who was appointed minister without portfolio in the Israeli
government in November 1995, by then Prime Minister Peres and who served in that capacity
until June 1996. Peres described Amital as a moderate. In explaining Amital's views, Tal
relied heavily upon Amital's published article, &quot;On the significance of the Yom
Kippur War [1973].&quot; To illustrate Amital's emphasis upon spiritual yearning and the
political-messianic stream of thought, Tal quoted the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The war broke out against the background of the revival of the kingdom of
  Israel, which in its metaphysical (not only symbolic) status is evidence of the decline of
  the spirit of defilement in the Western world ... The Gentiles are fighting for their mere
  survival as Gentiles, as the ritually unclean. Iniquity is fighting its battle for
  survival. It knows tat in the wars of God there will not be a place for Satan, for the
  spirit of defilement, or for the remains of Western culture, the proponents of which are,
  as it were, secular Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tal further interpreted Amital's and thus Gush Emunim's basic views:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The modern secular world, according to this approach, &quot;is struggling
  for survival, and thus our war is directed against the impurity of Western culture and
  against rationality as such.&quot; It follows tat the alien culture has to be eradicated
  because &quot;all foreignness draws us closer to the alien, and the alien causes
  alienation, as is the position of those who still adhere to Western culture and who
  attempt to fuse Judaism wit rationalist empiricist and democratic culture.&quot; According
  to Amital's approach, the Yom Kippur War has to be comprehended in its messianic
  dimension: a struggle against civilization in its entirety.</p>
