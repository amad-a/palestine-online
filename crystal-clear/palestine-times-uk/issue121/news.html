<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon wants &#147;cease-fire in return for
nothing&#148;</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the Israeli propaganda machine continues with its vociferous
misinformation campaign against the Palestinian Authority, particularly its Chairman
Yasser Arafat, the Israeli occupation army and para-military Jewish settlers have
continued their own concerted campaign of terror and rampage throughout the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest escalation culminated on 24 June, when Israeli intelligence
agents murdered a Fatah activist in downtown Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian police sources, Osama Fathi Jawabra, 29, was
killed when a booby-trapped public telephone in downtown Nablus exploded in his face as he
picked up the telephone handset. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The murder, which was apparently a fulfilment of an earlier decision by
the Israeli inner cabinet to resume the &#147;assassination policy&#148; against intifada
activists, infuriated the Palestinian public and forced Fatah leaders to warn that
&#147;this cease-fire is killing us,&#148; and that &#147; death will be met with death
from now on.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This was a brazen violation of the cease-fire; it comes on the eve
of Sharon&#146;s visit to the United States; this is unacceptable and the world community
must realize that it is the Israelis who are breaching the cease-fire,&#148; said Anan
al-Attiri, a spokesperson of Fatah in the Nablus area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During Jawabra&#146;s funeral on 25 June, in which thousands of
Palestinians took part, Fatah leaders vowed to avenge the murder.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The criminal Sharon should understand that Fatah will not allow its
cadres to be assassinated under the rubric of the cease-fire&#133;the cease-fire can go to
hell.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the outbreak of the intifada nearly nine months ago, the Israeli
army and intelligence services assassinated as many as 40 Palestinian activists in what
several human rights groups around the world termed &#147;extra-judicial executions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Israeli army bulldozers once again visited with utter
destruction the small refugee camp of Yibna in Rafah at the southern tip of the Gaza
Strip, demolishing as many as 20 homes and leaving their indigent occupants homeless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As usual, the brutal ugliness of Israeli racism manifested itself in ways
defying even linguistic description.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After midnight, the tanks and bulldozers arrived. They yelled at us
to leave the house; we took the children and fled, and they flattened it,&#148; said Hasan
Burhom<font FACE="Symbol">-</font> a victim of the latest savagery<font FACE="Symbol">-</font>
with a whiff of cynicism mixed with a heavy dose of frozen rage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They only gave us five minutes to get the children out; they told us
the bulldozers would crush them if we didn&#146;t get them out in five minutes,&#148; said
his cousin, Muhammed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked where he and the other victims were going to sleep that night, he
said &#147;somewhere between the land and the sky.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another victim, Ahmed Burhom, described the demolition of the houses as
&#147;a massacre of buildings.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;An army that storms civilian neighbourhoods in the quiet hours
before dawn, destroying residential homes and terrorizing sleeping men, women and children
without any justification, is not an army of soldiers but an army of thugs and
criminals&#133;if something with this ugliness and brutality happened anywhere in the
world, it would be called a war crime, yet the world is silent at this Jewish
Nazism,&#148; said Burhom, who lost a home and an olive orchard, in an angry but serene
tone.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As daylight broke, the victims, some distraught by the traumatic
experience while others raised their hands heavenward asking God to avenge Israeli
oppression, wistful-looking men and women, rummaged the concrete block piles of what was
left of their homes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Children carried away kitchenware and dragged away half-torn mattresses,
or simply searched for a toy they couldn&#146;t bear to see crushed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An Israeli army spokesman said in a terse statement that they were
carrying out &#147;engineering work&#148; for the purpose of widening a road used by
Israeli army patrols along the Egyptian borders. Asked why the army chose to carry out the
operation after midnight, the spokesman said, &#147;Can you suggest a more suitable
time?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the rabid destruction of the houses was in reality a collective
reprisal against innocent and defenceless civilians for the death of two Israeli soldiers
a day earlier by a Palestinian martyr-bomber. Hamas claimed responsibility for the
operation, saying it was &#147;in retaliation for continued Israeli killings and
repression of our people.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The agricultural &#147;victim&#148;</b></u><br>
The barbarity of the wholesale home-demolition in Rafah was actually being matched with
another equally affronting barbarity, namely the wide-scale burning by Jewish settlers of
Palestinian fields and orchards.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources and foreign journalists have described the torching of
the fields as &#147;phenomenal,&#148; pointing out that thousands of acres of Palestinian
orchards, fields of almonds, and wheat crops have been reduced to ashes by settler fires.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, the settlers have concentrated their rampage in and around
villages lying between Nablus and Ramallah, many of which are still outside the
jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In some cases, many villagers lost everything, having seen the source of
their livelihood, which they spent their lifetime tending and caring for like they rear
their children, turn to ash in a matter of a few hours.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army, which normally guards the settlers &#147;while at
work&#148; against Palestinian resistance, often blocked firefighters from putting out the
fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In several cases, occupation soldiers themselves take part in setting
Palestinian fields on fire as happened at the villages of Abud and Sawiya south of Nablus
on 24 and 25 June.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The rampage of arson and vandalism is carried out by messianic Jewish
settlers who believe that Palestinian villages and towns should be burned down in the same
way the old Israelites dealt with Canaanite tribes during biblical times. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon continues repression policy</b></u><br>
In light, it seems amply clear that the Israeli government has neither the willingness nor
the inclination to significantly reduce the level of repression meted out to the overall
Palestinian population. This, in turn, makes it extremely difficult for Yasser Arafat to
persuade his tormented people to suspend their resistance of Israeli repression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, Sharon seems intent on retaining virtually all the repressive
measures against the Palestinians while at the same time continuing to demand a
&#147;complete&#148; cessation to &#147;violence.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the experience of the last two weeks shows that this is
quite impossible. </p>

<hr align="center">

<p align="center"><a name="2" href="news.html#top"><font color="#0000FF">Top</font></a></p>
<b>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Precarious cease-fire</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the Israeli blockade of Palestinian towns and villages remaining
effectively in place, and with Jewish terrorist attacks on Palestinian civilians
continuing unabated, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is having difficulties
convincing the politically-educated Palestinian public to end the intifada, or even to
stop responding in kind to settler attacks and vandalism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, despite Israeli propaganda and often outright misinformation about
relaxing the suffocating siege, it was clear that the &#147;relaxation&#148; lacked in
substance and did not alleviate substantially the overall plight of over three million
Palestinians who are more or less confined to their immediate places of residence, thanks
to the draconian blockade.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In some instances, the Israeli army did remove concrete slabs off some
roads, but no sooner had the television cameras disappeared than the Israeli army
re-established the roadblocks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In some other cases, the stationary roadblocks were simply replaced by
mobile roadblocks, a ruse aimed at tricking the world public opinion into believing that
the blockade had indeed been relaxed, all while maintaining the same level of repression
against the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, far from relaxing the siege, the Israeli army introduced even
more stringent measures in several localities, particularly in the Hebron and Tulkarm
regions, apparently for no other purpose than to further torment the Palestinians and make
their daily life as unbearable and harsh as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, the Israeli army deployed a number of tanks and armoured
vehicles to the Tarousa Knoll, just outsideDura, 12 kilometres south-west of Hebron,
cutting the town off from several surrounding villages and forcing villagers to use
donkeys and mules instead of cars as their chief means of transportation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are no Jewish settlements in the area, and the onerous presence of
the Israeli occupation soldiers only a few hundred metres from the confines of a
Palestinian town of 30,000 can only be construed to mean that the Israeli army is looking
for trouble.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to causing an atmosphere of virtual claustrophobia in shut-off
Palestinian towns and villages, the effect of the Israeli blockade can be deadly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, a Palestinian man with a chronic kidney illness died at an
Israeli roadblock near Nablus, having been denied access to the hospital on the other side
of the roadblock. The man is added to a score of Palestinians who succumbed to their
illnesses at Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks since the beginning of the intifada nearly
nine months ago.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Settlers&#146; Role</b></u><br>
If the Israeli army is entrusted with tormenting the Palestinian people at the macro
level, the heavily armed fanatic Jewish settlers are left to unleash their own virulent
violence at the micro level, namely against Palestinian villages and hamlets contiguous to
the estimated 150 Jewish settlements and settlement outposts dotting the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers&#146; wanton violence assumes two main aspects: ambushing
Palestinian motorists on the roads, especially the so-called bypass roads linking the
settlements with Jewish metropolitan centres in Israel proper; and the habitual practice
of violently marauding through Palestinian villages, opening fire randomly, setting wheat
fields and olive orchards on fire, and vandalizing as much property as they can get. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, this senseless rampage very often takes place in full view
of Israeli occupation soldiers who apparently have orders to &#147;let the settlers vent
their anger.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And &#147;venting their anger&#148; also means murder.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 14 June, the settlers opened fire on a Palestinian lorry outside
Jerusalem, killing 42-year-old Awni Abdul Raouf al-Haddad, a father of six children, of
Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ambush took place near the village of Hizma only a few hundred metres
from an Israeli army camp, known as &#147;Anatut.&#148; As usual in such circumstances,
the Israeli army sought to deflect attention from the settlers, claiming that
&#147;probably non-Jews were responsible for the incident.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing came less than 24 hours after an Orthodox clergyman was
ambushed in a similar manner, less than a hundred metres from an Israeli roadblock outside
the settlement of Ma&#146;ali Adumim, east of Jerusalem. No arrests have been made in
connection with the two incidents.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, the two murders came only a few hours after Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon told Likud supporters that &#147;we should surprise them (the Arabs)
on the roads and make them feel unsafe.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And that wasn&#146;t all. Three more Palestinians, all of them children,
were also killed by the Israeli army soldiers in Khan Younis (Gaza Strip), prompting the
indignant Palestinian public to question the wisdom of maintaining a cease-fire while the
big boots of the Israeli army were still pressed against the chests and necks of the
Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The children are 12-year-old Ali Murad Abu Sahawish, shot dead by an
Israeli sniper near the Tuffah junction south of Gaza town, and Suleiman al-Masri, also
12, killed by an Israeli soldier in Rafah at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A third boy, identified as 16-year-old Adel Hasan Muqanan, died on 18 June
of wounds he had sustained on 16 June near the Tuffah junction. A fourth Palestinian, an
elderly man aged 81 years old, was run over by a Jewish settler on 18 June while crossing
the road near Qalqilya in the northern West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Zionist killing of an innocent Palestinian took place on 21 June,
when Israeli occupation troops opened fire on a group of Palestinian labourers while
bypassing an Israeli army roadblock near the village of Na&#146;alin north-west of
Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists killed 30-year-old Oudhe Ahmed Nafie&#146;, a father of six,
who was returning home from a hard day&#146;s work.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army said it was investigating the incident, a euphemism for
consigning the story to history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The continued killing and repression of the Palestinians by the Israeli
army and Jewish settlers alike prompted Arafat on 16 June to appeal to visiting UN
Secretary-General Kofi Anan to see to it that international monitors are deployed in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip &#147;to establish who is violating the cease-fire.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Anan is unlikely to push for international monitors to be
deployed in the Occupied Territories as long as the Americans reject the idea.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This pushed Arafat to warn that the American-brokered cease-fire would
collapse if the international community did not force Israel to abide by the Mitchell
committee report and Tenet work-plan. Arafat&#146;s warnings did not seem to be tactical. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, several high-level security meetings between Israel and the PA in
recent weeks ended in failure due to adamant Israeli refusal to establish a direct linkage
between the security and political aspects of the current crisis, a linkage without which
the PA would not have accepted the Mitchell report in the first place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the intifada fighters are not giving the cease-fire the benefit of the
doubt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 18 June, Palestinian guerillas killed two Jewish settlers in two
separate incidents outside a Jewish settlement in the Nablus area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A third Israeli, a high-ranking Shin Bet officer bearing the rank of
Lieutenant Colonel, was killed and his bodyguard was badly injured by a repentant Arab
collaborator whom the officer met at a pre-arranged rendezvous south of Jerusalem. The
Palestinian was subsequently killed by a third Israeli soldier who was present at the
spot.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Responsibility for the three attacks was claimed by the Aqsa Martyrs
Regiments, the military arm of Fatah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah, along with the Islamist and other nationalist organizations, has
displayed a cautious posture vis-�-vis a cease-fire, arranged by CIA Director George
Tenet and accepted under duress by Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This posture assumes the form of maintaining fully the popular aspect of
the intifada while retaining a modicum of armed resistance, if only as a response to
attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Let us not fool ourselves; any negotiations with Israel would be a
waste of time if not backed up by action in the field,&#148; said Marwan al-Barghouthi,
Fatah leader in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And this is not only Barghouthi&#146;s thinking.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the vast bulk of Palestinians seem to think likewise.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Palestinians welcome BBC documentary, <br>
say it is time to try Sharon as war criminal</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians have lauded a BBC documentary that was broadcast Sunday
night, 17 June, and concluded that there is sufficient evidence to indict Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon as a war criminal for his involvement in the Sabra and Shatilla
massacres of Palestinian refugees in 1982.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA official Ahmed Abdul Rahman voiced satisfaction that the world &#147;is
finally beginning to hear our crying after so many years of massacres of our people by the
Israeli State.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have been crying and screaming to the world for more than five
decades that Sharon and other Zionist leaders are war criminals who ought to be treated
like the Nazi war criminals&#133;It gives us some solace that the wold is beginning to
listen to us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Rahman urged &#147;all justice-loving people and human rights
organizations around the world to start legal action against Sharon now, making use of
this significant international documentary.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian official dismissed the view that starting legal procedures
against Sharon now would undermine peace efforts and harden Israel&#146;s already hostile
posture towards the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The opposite is true. Peace can only be achieved when the criminals
are brought to justice and tried for their crimes against humanity.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added, &#147;We owe it to those children who were slaughtered like
sheep; the young women who were raped, humiliated and slaughtered; the helpless souls who
were murdered so callously; we owe it to them to try the criminals.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, while welcoming the screening of the documentary 22 years after
the massacres, most Palestinians harbour no illusions about the vast distance between
indicting Sharon in a television documentary and prosecuting him before an international
tribunal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We know that Sharon is a big criminal; the world knows that Sharon
is a big criminal; the United States knows that Sharon is a war criminal; the question is
not whether Sharon is a war criminal or not, the real question is whether the world,
particularly the United States, has the political will to try Sharon as a war
criminal,&#148; said Hanna Issa, a Palestinian expert on international law based in
Ramallah in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Issa argued that the condemnation of Sharon as a war criminal by a
television documentary was late but not too late.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Crimes against humanity don&#146;t lose relevance with the passage
of time, and it is never too late to try Sharon and other Zionist leaders for their
hideous crimes against the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Issa suggested that legal steps by Arab States, the Palestinian Authority
and human organizations be taken immediately against Sharon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It would be self-defeating and humiliating for the Arabs and the
Palestinians to stop at this documentary and celebrate victory; they must pursue this
paramount issue, because if they don&#146;t, Sharon and the other Sharon&#146;s who will
come after him will repeat the Sabra and Shatilla massacres once, twice and thrice as long
as they think they can get away with it.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The matter (prosecuting Sharon) will take time, a long time,&#148;
said Issa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Justice without power is powerless, and power without justice is
oppressive,&#148; he added.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The BBC Panorama programme featured Judge Richard Goldstone, former chief
prosecutor for the UN criminal tribunals for both the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, who
concluded that Ariel Sharon should be tried for war crimes in connection with the 1982
massacres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;If the person who gave the command knows, or should know&#133;that
there&#146;s a situation where innocent civilians are going to be injured or killed then
that person is responsible, in my book even more responsible than the people who carry out
the orders.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The programme also contained comments from international legal expert
Richard Falk, Professor of International Law at Princeton University, suggesting that
Sharon could be indicted for his role in the massacres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government condemned the BBC for screening the documentary,
accusing it of &#147;anti-Israeli bias&#148; and of being &#147;pro-Palestinian.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A statement by the Israeli foreign ministry, released on 17 June,
criticized the timing of the documentary saying, &#147;It gives the Palestinians
additional ammunition in the propaganda war with Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the BBC rebuffed the Zionist criticisms, arguing that the job of
a reporter is to deal with the facts, and the facts of Sabra and Shatilla are deeply
shocking.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In its statement, the BBC said it stood by the story which it called
&#147;a legitimate analysis of a human rights issue.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;At Panorama we are simply being true to a basic principle. It is a
duty of journalists to question the actions and record of those who wield power.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fergal Keane, the BBC journalist who reported the piece, repudiated claims
by Ramaam Gissen, a spokesman for Sharon, that the documentary was an insult to Sharon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Contrary to inaccurate statements put out by some Israeli officials,
Mr. Gissen was fully aware of the subject when he gave the interview.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;When the interview was over he left us on friendly terms. In fact
some days later his officials provided us with a letter to help us transit easily through
Ben Gurion airport with our tapes.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Massacre survivors testify</b></u><br>
On Monday, 18 June, an important event took place in Brussels, as the dossiers of 28
Palestinian and Lebanese survivors from the Sabra and Shatilla massacres were deposited
before an investigative judge.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The case was officially opened against Sharon and any other Israeli or
Lebanese persons responsible for &#147;war crimes, crimes against humanity, and
genocide.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is expected that a decision on whether to indict Sharon by a Belgian
court will be made by the end of June 2001.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the matter is not as simple as people getting killed on both
sides. The Zionist regime is, after all, the tormentor, occupier, oppressor and usurper,
while the Palestinians are the decimated underdogs, struggling to free themselves from the
shackles of Zionist occupation and domination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attack itself was described as the worst in five years and the
bloodiest since the outbreak of the intifada in late September of last year. Israeli
leaders, enraged by the bombing, decided to take a new set of reprisals against the
Palestinians, including the hermetic sealing off of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
closure of all border crossings from and to the autonomous enclaves, as well as barring
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat from leaving Ramallah, effectively placing
him under town arrest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the &#147;Shtakhim&#148; or &#147;territories&#148; or
&#147;areas&#148; as dubbed by the Israeli media, were effectively converted into a huge
open-air detention camp, or mini-camps, cut off from each other and isolated from the rest
of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the Israeli inner cabinet reportedly adopted a set of
&#147;practical measures&#148; against the Palestinians, an ostensible reference to
military reprisals against &#147;targets&#148; in Palestinian towns in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Indeed, a high-ranking Israeli military commander was quoted as saying that
the &#147;cease-fire&#148; with the Palestinians was over and that Israel was amassing
more troops to the &#147;front lines.&#148; Needless to say, the term front lines is
scandalously misleading since Israel is still occupying the West Bank and the
PA-administered towns are encircled by the Israeli army and no Palestinian can enter or
leave these cities unless allowed by the occupation forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the PA&#150;forced into a defensive position in the Public
Relations showdown with Israel&#150;declared its willingness to accept and observe an
unconditional and immediate cease-fire in order to stop &#147;this terrible
bloodshed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this context, Arafat did issue clear instructions to his security
subordinates to strictly adhere to the cease-fire and refrain from firing unless it is in
self-defense.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, it is hard to give &#147;the cease-fire&#148; (an inaccurate
wording describing a case of popular resistance against a military occupation) the benefit
of the doubt, as long as Israel refuses to truly accept the Mitchell committee report,
especially those clauses demanding a freeze on Jewish settlement expansion in the West
Bank, including the so-called &#147;natural growth expansion.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, while Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the ultimate public
relations officer for the war criminal Sharon, continues to preach Israeli
&#147;acceptance&#148; of the report, other ministers, and even Sharon himself, continue
to say &#147;No&#148;, though somewhat sparingly, to a complete settlement freeze in the
occupied territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And it is not only verbally. On 28 May, Housing Minister Natan Sharansky
told an Israeli radio station that he had approved construction bids for 496 new settler
units within Ma&#146;ale Adumim, the largest illegal Jewish settlement in the West Bank,
where there are hundreds of empty flats awaiting occupants and where home sales reportedly
plummeted since the start of the intifada. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharanksy had also approved bids for 217 additional settler units in Alfei
Menashe, near the Palestinian town of Qalqilya. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the Israeli government&#146;s increasingly apparent
intent on keeping up Jewish settlement aggrandizement exposes naked its colonialist
designs in the West Bank, which can be summarized in one word: a fait accompli.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, imposing the fait accompli on the Palestinians, and forcing them
to succumb to it, seems to be the undeclared policy of the Sharon government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon repeatedly said in no unmistakable terms that he would not agree to
dismantle any settlement and that Israel would keep the bulk of the West Bank in the
context of any possible &#147;arrangement&#148; with the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Sharon seems to mean what he says, and worse, he has demonstrated
characteristic willingness to back up his political belief with lethal military force.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 18 May, he sent his F-16 fighter-bombers, the second deadliest weapon
at Israel&#146;s disposal after its sizeable nuclear arsenal, to rain havoc and death on
several Palestinian towns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The lethal combat aircraft dropped munitions as large as 250 kilograms on
a prison, a police dormitory and a TV relay station in Nablus, Tulkarm and Ramallah, as
well as the Gaza Strip, killing, mutilating and incinerating over a hundred people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The F-16 bombing only culminated a spate of wanton killing targeting
civilians, activists and especially Force-17 cadres whom Israel accuses of taking a
leading role in armed resistance against Israeli occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing was carried out through a variety of means, including often
rabid and indiscriminate artillery bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods which on 7 May
killed four-month-old Iman Hijjo while in her mother&#146;s lap in their Khan Younis home.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It also included murderous ambushes and assassinations such as the
cold-blooded killing by undercover Israeli troops on 14 May of five Palestinian policemen
who were manning a guard post near Beitunia just south of Ramallah. That particular
killing, many Palestinians felt, was a vile, treacherous act, as the five victims were
assigned to liaise with their Israeli security counterparts in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a vile and unethical crime and Israel will not get away with
it,&#148; said an angry Yasser Arafat, pointing out that the victim&#146;s guard post was
established in coordination with the Israeli army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The whole thing was unexpected; it never occurred to us that the
Israelis would murder the very people with whom they liaise and coordinate on a daily
basis&#133;this is a massacre, a real massacre, except in this case, policemen were
killed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army only belatedly recognized that a mistake had been made,
but even then, it did virtually nothing to ensure that the &#147;incident&#148; would not
be repeated.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Boomerang effect</b></u><br>
This Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, based as it is on persecution and
subjugation, has not been without a boomerang effect. Palestinian radicals from Hamas and
the Islamic Jihad and, for the first time, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP), stepped up their car-bomb attacks in Israel&#146;s urban centres,
sending waves of terror and panic throughout the Israeli Jewish population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The martyr-bombing in Netanya on 18 May and the 2 June bombing at the Tel
Aviv disco were only examples of what the Palestinians term as &#147;their ability to
strike deep into Israel and create a semblance of a balance of terror vis-�-vis the third
strongest military power on earth.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the bombings, the retaliations, the retaliatory bombings, and then the
fresh retaliation, all underscore the fundamental bankruptcy and futility of the Zionist
policy, a policy based on bullying the Palestinians to come to terms with Jewish
apartheid.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians do realize that their struggle, even the martyrdom
operations, will not defeat Israel at the strategic level. However, Palestinian resistance
is succeeding in persuading the Zionist regime, including its fascist clique comprised of
the likes of Sharon and Katsave, that sustaining apartheid in Palestine is not without a
cost, and the cost is big and growing.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Palestinian journalists in the danger zone</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</strong><br>
Covering the current Palestinian uprising has never been an easy task, particularly for
the largely unprotected Palestinian journalists and cameramen who are often viewed by the
Israeli army and Jewish settlers as &#147;representative of the enemy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, for the average Palestinian journalist, it doesn&#146;t seem to
make much of a difference whether he or she works for WAFA (the Palestinian News Agency),
the Abu Dhabi Television, or for that matter, Middle East International, for, in the final
analysis, all Palestinians, including journalists and correspondents, fall within the
&#147;enemy category,&#148; as far as the Israeli army and settlers are concerned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If some foreign journalists are treated by the Israelis with a modicum of
hostility because of the &#147;message&#148;, Palestinian journalists are treated with
double and sullen hostility because of both the &#147;message&#148; and &#147;the
messenger.&#148; The message is hostile and the messenger is the enemy!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On several occasions, Israeli hostility to the Palestinian media
culminated with aerial bombardment of transmitters of the PA radio station (Voice of
Palestine) on 12 October, and the PA television station in Gaza during the winter.
Moreover, the offices of the al-Hayatul Jadida newspaper in Ramallah were twice strafed
with machine-gun fire, after being accused of fanning incitement against the Israeli
occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For journalists in the field, the sullen hostility is expressed in various
ways, ranging from feeling the onerous and often menacing presence of ready-to-shoot
Israeli soldiers and their rough treatment at checkpoints and roadblocks to receiving one
or two rubber-coated bullets or even a few &#147;warning shots&#148; in the lower or upper
part of one&#146;s body.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, Israeli assaults on journalists, especially cameramen, became a
recurrent affair ever since the outbreak of the intifada more than eight months ago. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) released an
initial report on the subject as early as November, documenting more than two dozen cases
of journalists having been injured or harassed while covering the intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then, CPJ stated that it was particularly disturbed by seven cases in
which journalists either charged that they were intentionally targeted by Israeli forces
or where the circumstances of the shootings raise concerns that the Israeli defense forces
were at least guilty of extreme negligence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the uprising raged on, assaults on and harassment of Palestinian and to
a lesser extent foreign journalists received minimal or inadequate coverage in the Western
media.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, the killing of the Palestinian journalist Aziz Ibrahim
al-Tanah was hardly mentioned in the major Western news outlets, especially in the United
States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Tanah, 32, was gunned down by an Israeli sniper while covering the news
of the intifada in Bethlehem in late October. He was the head of the WAFA bureau in
Bethlehem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The serious wounding of a French journalist who, like the rest, had
&#147;PRESS&#148; clearly inscribed on his back preceded the killing of Tanah. The French
authorities did protest the incident, but that was it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The wounding, beating and harassment of journalists by the IDF, and
especially by Jewish settlers, continued unabated, reflecting a pattern combining criminal
negligence, recklessness and, yes, malicious indifference towards journalists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">CPJ Executive Director Ann Cooper wrote in an appeal to Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon on 15 April that &#147;we remain deeply concerned about the
IDF&#146;s record of harassing, intimidating and attacking journalists, despite the
Israeli government&#146;s stated commitment to press freedom.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 11 June, a delegation from CPJ met with Israeli ambassador to the U.S.,
David Ivry, to express its deep concern about the cases of more than a dozen journalists
wounded by Israeli gunfire during the course of the intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The delegation reportedly expressed its concern that in some cases,
journalists may have been deliberately targeted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It pointed out that at the very least, the IDF acted recklessly in firing
live rounds or rubber-coated steel bullets that injured journalists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Unless the Israeli government takes immediate steps to put a stop to
these incidents, it is only a matter of time before another journalist is killed,&#148;
said CPJ board chairman Gene Roberts at the meeting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of the nearly 15 journalists who were shot and wounded by the Israeli
army, 3 sustained moderate-to-serious wounds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 15 May, a reporter for the French Television channel, TF1, Bertrand
Aguirre, was hit in the chest by a live round fired by an Israeli border policeman. Film
footage of the incident showed the Israeli soldier, with a cigarette dangling from his
mouth, shooting indiscriminately in the direction of unarmed civilians and journalists.
Aguirre&#146;s bulletproof vest apparently saved his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 20 April, Layla Odeh, correspondent for Abu Dhabi TV, was hit by a
bullet in the right femur while filming with her camera crew in Rafah at the southern tip
of the Gaza Strip. Eyewitnesses testified that the area then was quiet and witnessed no
violence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, three Reuters correspondents had been shot at by IDF troops
near the Mintar junction on 18 March and the incident was described by IDF spokesman
Oliver Rafowicz as &#147;warning shots,&#148; claiming the journalists had put themselves
at risk by approaching the IDF outpost.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A really flagrant attack on Palestinian journalists took place in Hebron
on 6 June when a mob of Israeli settlers attacked four cameramen covering a settler
rampage in the Old Town. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to eyewitnesses, rabid settlers who were attacking Palestinian
civilians and vandalizing their property in full view of on-looking Israeli soldiers,
turned on journalists and cameramen, beating them and smashing their cameras.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An AFP photojournalist, Husam Abu Allan, suffered a fractured jaw
resulting from being hit repeatedly by a settler using the butt of his M-16 rifle. Abu
Allan had been seriously wounded by IDF bullets while covering Palestinian protests in
downtown Hebron two years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Cameramen Nayef Hashlamoun, Mazen Da&#146;ana, Laui Abu Haikal and Imad
Said all sustained various injuries resulting from being beaten.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The previous day, two other Palestinian cameramen, Tareq Kayali and Amer
Abedeen, who work for a German television station, were held up at the notorious IDF
Tarqumya junction, and severely beaten. The two men testified that an Israeli army jeep
actually attempted to run them over.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the same day, Israeli troops shot an Associated Press photographer in
the leg, using rubber-coated steel bullets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The frequent attacks and harassment of journalists are obviously aimed at
intimidating them in the hope that they would refrain from covering events deemed
unfavourable by the Israeli army and settlers, such as settler violence and vandalism
against Palestinian civilians. Moreover, it seems the Israelis hold journalists and
cameramen, especially those who don&#146;t show &#147;understanding&#148; of the Israeli
&#147;viewpoint&#148; at least partly responsible for some of the unfavourable coverage
Israel receives in the West. This is a classical case of shooting the messenger for
communicating a bad message.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the Palestinian side, an isolated incident briefly marred the otherwise
impeccable Palestinian record of good treatment of foreign journalists and gave Israel a
propaganda munitions to besmirch the Palestinian struggle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 29 May, two Western journalists (an American and a Briton) and their
Arabic interpreter and driver were &#147;kidnapped&#148; and released two hours later by
two individuals associated with the Fatah movement. The incident, which took place in
Gaza, blown out of proportion by pro-Israeli media, was actually an individual act that
was totally condemned by all Palestinian factions as &#147;uncharacteristic of the
Palestinian people and detrimental to our noble struggle.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the two journalists kidnapped, Joshua Hammer, head of
Newsweek&#146;s Jerusalem bureau said, &#147;We were treated very well.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two journalists even refrained from referring to the time spent at a
Palestinian house as kidnapping, saying they would stay in Gaza for the rest of the week,
according to previous plans, to finish their work.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israeli army admits using prohibited <br>
munitions against civilians</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The Israeli occupation army admitted using
internationally-prohibited munitions against Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli State-run radio quoted a senior army officer as saying that
the army &#147;has been using tank-fired flechette anti-personnel shells&#148; against
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This lethal type of munitions killed three Palestinian women from one
family from south of the Gaza Strip on 9 June, and claimed many other lives in the course
of the 8-month-old Palestinian intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli officer said the use of the deadly shell against individuals
was &#147;legitimate,&#148; claiming the army was authorized to use it &#147;outside
populated areas.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians, however, strongly dispute the claim, stressing that
hundreds of flechette shells were fired on residential areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hospital sources in Gaza, especially in the Rafah area, spoke of hundreds
of civilians wounded by the darts released when the shell explodes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Jane&#146;s Defense Weekly, the Israeli army is using a
modified version of the M949 105 mm APERS-T round provided by the U.S. in the 1970s.
According to a U.S. manual, the round is &#147;designed for close-in assault against
massed infantry assaults and for offensive fire against exposed enemy personnel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army fitted the M949 shell with the Reshef Technologies OMEGA
M127 electronic fuse, which is set, before the round is fired. At the set range, the
forward section of the M949 round ruptures, releasing approximately 5,000 small flechette
darts and a dye marker. The flechettes are dispersed in a cone-shaped pattern, which is
300 metres long, and about 94 metres wide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian security official Abdul Razzaq al-Majayda described the use of
the flechette shells against Palestinian civilians as &#147;a manifestly blatant war
crime.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Their aim is to maim, cripple and kill as many people as
possible,&#148; said Majayda.</p>

torture of activist by Shin Bet</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - A Jerusalem-based human rights group charged that
Israeli Shin Bet interrogators beat and tortured a Palestinian human rights activist, who
has been detained by the Israeli occupation authorities for a month without charge or
trial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) said Abed Rahman
al-Ahmar, a well-known human rights activist, had been tortured and shackled in utter
disregard for human rights and dignity and despite an Israeli Supreme Court injunction
against torture.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Ahmar, who works as a field researcher with the PHRMG was arrested and
beaten by Israeli security forces on 24 May and has since been held in detention, first at
Gush Etzion military detention centre and since 30 May at the notorious Russian compound
detention in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 10 June, attorney Allegra Pacheco discovered that al-Ahmar had been
tortured, shackled in tight handcuffs to a slanting chair for the entire day. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This torture method, known as &#147;Shabah,&#148; was outlawed by the
Israeli Supreme Court on 6 December 1999.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Ahmar had been imprisoned several times in the past and had been
tortured repeatedly by Shin Bet agents while detained at the Russian Compound and,
consequently, still suffers from a hiatal hernia and several back problems. He has been
adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.</p>

government and army to seriously take the &#147;looming danger&#148; into account.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A new study by a University of Haifa Professor warned that the Arab
population within mandatory Palestine would soon outnumber Jews.</p>

fronts which will be like a time-bomb just waiting to explode,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the racist professor, there are today 5 million Jews and 5
million non-Jews in Palestine. The latter figure is composed of 4.5 million Arabs and the
remainder are non-Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union.</p>

Jews, based on population growth and an average of 50,000 immigrant settlers a year. As to
