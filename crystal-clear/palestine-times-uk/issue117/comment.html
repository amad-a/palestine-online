<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">The masses must act</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A conflation of scandalous aspects ranging from ignominious subservience
to U.S. hegemony to suppressing Arab masses and intellectuals and persecuting any dissent
to the often stagnant political or social order have always characterized the unholy
relations between many Arab regimes and the United States, especially in the post-Cold War
era.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some regimes choose to embrace the &#147;son&#148; in order to have access
to the &#147;father&#148;, like distant Mauritania whose bankrupt Junta wasted no time
harrowing toward the Zionist regime and establishing friendly relations with the murderers
of Palestinian children and who are plotting to demolish Islam&#146;s third holiest shrine
in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other regimes, so generously agreed to turn their own countries into ready
warehouses for the American Army, Navy and Air Force.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, other &#147;brotherly&#148; Arab countries quietly but readily
allow U.S. and British aircraft to take off from bases in their territories in order to
rain immediate and postponed death on the heads of Iraqi men, women and children, and the
rationale is always to force the Iraqi regime to abide by United Nations resolutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What can we, as angry Arabs and Muslims watching helplessly as our
homeland is being raped by our arch enemy, call this debauchery, this apostasy? Is it
political prostitution? Or is it just the old definition of politics: the art of the
possible?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We eventually hold the keys to our future, and we must continue to harbour
an unflinching conviction to that effect, irrespective of all the cheapness in character
that we see permeating the Arab political system these days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One particularly disturbing aspect of Arab regimes&#146; cheapness of
character is their treatment of U.S. alliance with the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As it is well known, the U.S. is the State that enables Israel to carry
out all these wanton acts of savagery, banditry and terror against the Palestinian people
as well as the Lebanese and other Arab and Muslim peoples. It is the State that supplies
Israel with state-of-the-art weaponry in order to perpetuate its qualitative edge not only
over neighbouring countries but over the entire Arab world. It is the State that is
connected with the evil entity known as Israel through an umbilical relationship of evil,
oppression and aggression. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, it is incomprehensible that many Arab regimes continue to stress day
and night &#147;American-Arab friendship&#148;, even &#147;American-Arab alliance!&#148;
What a scandal!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, and after all the torment the United States has meted out to us
Arabs and Palestinians, there are still some Arab officials who continue unashamedly to
believe that the U.S. is capable of acting honestly and evenhandedly as a
&#147;broker&#148; between an insolent Israel and the decimated and vanquished
Palestinians who are desperate to end 33 years of malignant Zionist colonialism and
occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This inept Arab approach to the shameless American alliance with the
diabolical Zionist regime clearly shows that Arab regimes are stupid, naï¿½ve, gullible and
cowardly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is so because the regimes continue to make the same routine appeals to
the United States to play an equitable role between the lying-slayer and its frustrated
victim, the defenseless Palestinians. And almost invariably, the U.S. always flies in the
face of these &#147;appeals&#148; and does what it has always done: comfort the tormentor
and further torment the tormented.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But why does the U.S. so contemptuously disregard Arab interests and
feelings when her interests in the Arab world, not to mention the Muslim world, are
immense and extensive, and any sustained harm to these interests could seriously undermine
America&#146;s global standing?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The answer is very simple. The U.S. does not take the Arab leaders and
their protests and appeals seriously, or at least seriously enough, as the experts on Arab
affairs in Washington keep telling the guy at the White House that Arab leaders don&#146;t
always say what they mean and often don&#146;t mean what they say.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, America&#146;s wanton and callous disregard for Arab rights,
dignity and national interests will continue until Arabs wake up.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It would be futile, of course, to appeal to &#147;Arab pride&#148; to
induce Arab officials, like that foreign minister cited above, to wake up and start
telling the Americans that &#147;we, too, have interests, and we, too, have a public
opinion to which we must be responsible.&#148; He and the regimes he represents don&#146;t
understand the language of pride.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But neither is the alternative coming to terms with the depressive <i>fait
accompli</i> of the stagnant regimes in most Arab countries. For the masses have a role to
play, and there are growing signs that things are moving in the right direction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, the regimes must be made to understand that the time in which
the masses were treated as a herd of cattle has gone for good.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes, it takes just a nudge to get the message through. But in other
cases, it takes a demonstration, a violent protest, maybe even more, to convince the
grandchildren of Louis XVI and their Yankee master that enough is enough. </p>
