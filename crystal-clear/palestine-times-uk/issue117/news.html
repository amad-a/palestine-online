<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Opinion survey shows dwindling support <br>
for Arafat, more support for Hamas</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b><br>
A recently conducted and broad-based opinion survey supervised by Dr. Nader Said, head of
the development study programme at Beir Zeit University, has shown that Palestinians are
increasingly disenchanted with the current political deadlock and with Palestinian
Authority (PA) inability to deal effectively with the problems facing the Palestinian
society.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dr. Said, in an interview with the semi-official Palestinian daily, <i>al-Hayatul
Jadida</i> on 20 February, voiced profound pessimism at the results of the study,
describing them as &#147;ominous&#148; and &#147;portending a state of unprecedented
deterioration.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that the results reflected a comprehensive state of retreat
in all aspects of life, including the educational, economic and psychological fields.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The study, the results of which were published on 20 February, showed that
27% of Palestinian households have lost their income, while a staggering 73% reported that
their income has shrunk significantly since the outbreak of the intifada on 28 September.
Two-thirds of the respondents said that their income shrank to less than $300 per month
and 46% of the households reported that a family member lost his or her job.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Psychologically, 75% of the respondents said they were experiencing some
acute psychological disorders stemming from the prevailing political and economic
conditions. Children and teenagers were more affected, while women were shown to be more
vulnerable to psychological stress than men.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the field of education, 11% of the respondents said they could no
longer afford to complete their university and school education owing to loss of income.
Sixty per cent said their schooling was negatively affected by the intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Forty-two per cent said they experienced difficulty accessing health and
medical services, while 77% said they didn&#146;t feel physically safe citing the
roadblocks and checkpoints erected by the Israeli occupation troops on routes from and to
Palestinian population centres as the reason behind the fear.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Economically, 28% of the households in the West Bank and Gaza Strip said
they received some assistance (41% in Gaza and 20% in the West Bank). Eighty-four per cent
of the households said they had to cut down on their expenses owing to their decreasing
income. Fifty-five per cent said they had to spend from their savings, while 43% said they
had to borrow money from neighbours, relatives or friends.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thirty-seven per cent of the respondents opined that violence and
lawlessness were on the increase, while 40% said they felt otherwise. On the desire to
leave the country, 17% said they would immigrate if the opportunity arose.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Concerning support for the continuation of the intifada, 44% said they
were satisfied with the current pace of the intifada while 20% said they were somewhat
satisfied, whereas 23% said they were not satisfied.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fifty-eight per cent said they didn&#146;t think that the new American
President George W. Bush would lead a more balanced policy toward the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict than his predecessor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Regarding armed resistance and military operations against the Zionist
regime, 53% said they supported such operations inside 1948-Palestine, while 4% saying
they were against &#147;martyrdom operations.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for boycotting Israeli products, 57% of the respondents said the idea
was practicable, while a staggering 74% said that their purchase and consumption of
Israeli products was significantly reduced since the outbreak of the uprising.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Concerning the subject of collaborators, about 85% said they supported
capital punishment against collaborators convicted of working for the Israeli intelligence
against their own people and country. Seventy-seven per cent said that the death penalty
would constitute a strong deterrent against collaboration with the enemy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Twenty-eight per cent of the respondents said they would vote for Yasser
Arafat in case elections were held now. The figure is considered very low, compared to
previous results.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A majority of 52% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the
role played by the Islamist movements in the current intifada. Thirty per cent described
the performance of the Islamists in the intifada as &#147;average&#148; while only 10 per
cent said it was below average.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fifty-three per cent equated Fatah with the Palestinian Authority, saying
the two were two sides of the same coin. However, 27% opined that Fatah and the PA were
not the same thing, saying that Fatah had a distinct identity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked whom will you vote for if elections were to be held now, 28%
said they would vote for Yasser Arafat, 12% for Ahmed Yassin and 9% for Haidar Abdul
Shafi.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As to the popularity of political parties in Palestine, 47% said they did
not support any of the political parties operating now in the Palestinian arena. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, 26% said they supported Fatah (down from 46% three months ago),
18.5% said they supported Hamas, 4.3% said they supported the Islamic Jihad, and 2.3% said
they supported the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, most observers believe that support for Hamas is significantly
higher than forecast in this opinion poll, since the movement benefits from the general
Muslim population that generally accept and support the values and principles adopted by
Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, the figures produced by this poll show a significant rise in
Hamas&#146; popularity compared to what it was projected three months ago, when a
PLO-affiliated pollster put Hamas&#146; standing at less than 10% and Fatah at 46%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not difficult to understand why more Palestinians are choosing to
give Hamas and the Islamist movements in general their trust and support. From the very
inception of the Oslo process, Hamas made it clear that this process would not work and
would end up in a fiasco, which is exactly what has happened in the last few months. In
other words, the views of Hamas have been vindicated, and the supporters of Oslo, e.g.
Fatah and the PLO, have been proven wrong.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israel reverts to &#147;shoot-to-kill&#148;
policy against Palestinians</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> Following the election of Israel&#146;s certified
war criminal Ariel Sharon as the Jewish State&#146;s new Prime Minister on 6 February, the
Israeli occupation army escalated its torment and repression against Palestinian civilians
throughout the autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Much of the bloody violence that engulfed the West Bank and Gaza Strip was
actually initiated or deliberately triggered by the Israeli occupation army which
apparently resorted to its earlier, brazenly scandalous shoot-to-kill policy against
Palestinian protesters as well as ordinary Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli occupation troops on 12 February killed two more innocent
Palestinians, one in Ramallah and the other in Bethlehem, and in both cases, the label
&#147;cold-blooded murder&#148; can be ascribed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to eyewitnesses, Israeli troops manning an army outpost near the
village of Khader, 5 kilometres south-west of Bethlehem, opened fire on a group of
Palestinian labourers who were awaiting a bus to take them to their places of work.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a result, 22-year-old Ziad Ali Abu Eswayy was killed immediately, with
his work implements still in his hands. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nearly two hours later, near the village of Rafat south of Ramallah,
Israeli occupation soldiers manning a makeshift roadblock opened fire on a Palestinian car
trying to circumvent the roadblock, moderately injuring its driver, 35-year-old Atef
al-Nabulsi of East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bleeding badly, al-Nabulsi managed to park his car near a pile of earth,
over 200 metres away from the nearest Israeli soldier, apparently awaiting to be taken to
hospital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist soldiers prevented Palestinians in the area from taking the
bleeding man to hospital or even giving him first aid. And instead, one soldier
disembarked from his Jeep, headed straight to the moaning man, and fired several bullets
at his head and chest, killing him instantly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is sheer murder; they killed him after he was injured&#133;you
call those soldiers? They are not really soldiers, they are criminals, murderers and
gangsters,&#148; reported an eyewitness to the incident in an interview on the &#147;Voice
of Palestine,&#148; the official PA radio.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As usual in such circumstances, the Israeli army sought to extenuate the
brutal ugliness of the Zionist mentality by concocting a different story, parroted by the
Israeli (and many Western) media, claiming the two Palestinians were killed &#147;in
clashes&#148; with the occupation troops, a manifestly blatant lie with not even an iota
of truth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, Israeli occupation troops stepped up their bombing of
Palestinian population centres in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Hebron, as well as Khan Younis
in the Gaza Strip, using artillery and heavy machine-gun artillery.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Bethlehem, the bombardment targeted Beit Jala and two adjacent small
refugee camps, the &#147;Azza&#148; and the &#147;Ayda,&#148; injuring as many as ten
people and inflicting heavy damage to buildings and houses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least two houses were reported to be completely burned in Bethlehem by
the bombardment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A particularly fierce bombardment targeted Ramallah&#146;s twin city,
al-Bireh, on 12 February, wreaking havoc on the Jinan and Satah Marhaba neighbourhoods
and, as a result, numerous houses were either destroyed or badly damaged, forcing
occupants to become homeless or seek makeshift shelters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Israeli bombs also hit the offices of the semi-official
Palestinian daily, <i>Al-Hayatul Jadida</i>, the headquarters of the Palestinian Red
Crescent Society and the Ministry of local governance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is believed that the almost rabid Israeli violence was a form of
vendetta for the killing of an armed Israeli settler on 11 February, ostensibly by
Palestinian fighters, while travelling on a bypass road west of Beit Jala.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing of the settler, the first Israeli to be killed since
Sharon&#146;s election victory on 6 February, infuriated the settlers who began to
question Sharon&#146;s ability to restore &#147;stability and security&#148; to the
increasingly panicking settler population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the killing of the two innocent and defenseless Palestinians,
al-Nabulsi and Abu Eswayy, was apparently the Israeli army&#146;s way of appeasing the
settler and of &#147;evening up the score&#148; with the Palestinians. (Since the
beginning of the intifada, 400 Palestinians and only 53 Israeli soldiers and settlers
combined were killed.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli violence did not abate, but rather moved to the Gaza Strip where
Israeli occupation troops protecting the settlement block of Gush Katif randomly bombarded
Palestinian neighbourhoods in Khan Younis and surrounding areas for six hours on the night
of 12 February.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bombardment, described by Palestinians as one of the most intense
since the beginning of the intifada, forced hundreds of Palestinians at the Khan Younis
refugee camp to flee their homes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to hospital sources in Khan Younis, over 45 Palestinian
civilians were injured, 26 by gunfire and the rest by shrapnel. Five of the injured were
reported in difficult-to critical condition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, scores of people were asphyxiated by a new type of &#147;tear
gas&#148; which the Israeli army began using in the West Bank and Gaza Strip recently.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian medical sources described the new nerve agent as
&#147;occupying an intermediate position between normal tear gas and chemical nerve agents
used in warfare.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This was a type of gas that we had never seen before. It is
yellowish in colour and it causes such symptoms as fainting, vomiting with stains of
blood, acute shortness of breath, severe convulsions and even a nervous breakdown,&#148;
said a physician at the Khan Younis Nasser hospital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians have been suspecting for some time that Israel is using a
mild variety of chemical nerve-agents against Palestinian demonstrators which they fear
will have postponed or long-lasting effects on the population, such as infertility
(Palestinian fertility is Israel&#146;s nightmare) and even cancer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, the Israeli army denied having used such an agent, describing
the gas as &#147;not fatal.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Israeli army spokesman in Gaza remained silent when asked if
Israeli police would use this variety of gas against Jewish demonstrators.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Defying Sharon</b></u><br>
Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders from across the political spectrum seemed determined to
continue the intifada as the proper response to Sharon&#146;s threats and bellicosity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas leader and spiritual advisor Sheikh Ahmed Yassin vowed in a press
interview on 11 February to &#147;respond in kind to any miscalculations by Sharon.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>They know what we are capable of doing,&#148; said Yassin,
apparently alluding to suicide-bomb attacks, or martyrdom operations, which Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad organizations have carried out against Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &#147;he (Sharon) knows that we are not going to cede our
rights just because they happen to be militarily stronger than us now&#133;the strong do
not remain strong forever and the weak do not remain weak forever.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah, too, was no less defiant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The response of Fatah to the killer of children will be loud and
clear&#133;his fate will not be better than that of his predecessors,&#148; said the Fatah
leader in Bethlehem, Kamel Hmeid, in a statement on 12 February.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The settlements he spent his life building and establishing at the
expense of Palestinian lands will turn into fuel for hellfire.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No peace in sight</b></u><br>
With Sharon demanding a &#147;total stoppage of violence&#148; as a precondition for any
resumption of talks with the Palestinian Authority, and with virtually all Palestinian
popular forces determined to keep up the intifada irrespective of Sharon&#146;s threats,
and with Arafat seemingly reluctant or somewhat unable to order an end to the Aqsa
uprising, it seems sufficiently safe to assume that things will get worse before they get
better, if ever they will.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Killing, assassinations, and nerve gas </font></b></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</b><br>
Less than a week after murdering a high-ranking Palestinian Authority Force-17 officer in
the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation army on 19 February carried out another
assassination, this time in Nablus, the northern West Bank town. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources at the Askar refugee camp, where the new
murder took place, an Israeli army undercover death squad with sharp-shooting equipment
opened fire at Mahmoud Madani, 25, while he was returning from the noon prayer at the
local Mosque to his nearby grocery store, fatally wounding him in the chest and the neck. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Madani succumbed to his wounds at the Rafidia hospital two hours later. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army admitted perpetrating the murder, saying Madani was
&#147;liquidated&#148; for playing an active role in the Hamas military wing, the Izzedin
al-Qassam Brigades and for &#147;planning to carry out attacks against Israeli
targets.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The charges, as usual in such circumstances, often turn out to be mostly
concocted to justify the murder and also to ward off possible international criticisms, as
was the case last week when the United States criticized&#151;though in a mild
tone&#151;the assassination of the Force-17 officer Massoud Ayyad. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to reliable Palestinian sources, Madani had been subjected to a
vigorous interrogation by Shin Bet torturers in 1999 for several months after which he was
released for lack of any incriminating evidence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They tortured him uninterruptedly to force him to confess things he
didn&#146;t do, but they failed, and now they murdered him in cold blood based on baseless
whims. Where in the civilized world does this banditry, this gangsterism, happen?&#148;
questioned Madani&#146;s brother. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They just kill to satiate their seemingly instinctive thirst for
blood,&#148; he added, with a wistful resignation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, the assassination of Madani confirms beyond a doubt that
Israeli chief of staff Shaul Mofaz, who enjoys the full backing of both Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ariel Sharon as well as Ehud Barak, the man who is likely to become
Israel&#146;s next Defense Minister, is intent on keeping up, if not bolstering, the
policy of extra-judicial execution of Palestinian activists or those deemed as playing a
leading role in the Palestinian intifada. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If so, the Israeli occupation troops could be expected to indulge in even
bloodier acts of murder in the upcoming days and weeks which might target more prominent
intifada leaders. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the bus attack near Tel Aviv during the middle of February,
which killed eight Israeli soldiers and injured 17 others, the former Shin Bet chief
Gideon Ezra referred to Fatah Secretary-General in the West Bank Marwan al-Barghouthi as
&#147;the arch-terrorist.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;He is a terrorist, an arch-terrorist, and we shouldn&#146;t hesitate
to attack terrorist leaders, including Barghouthi,&#148; said Ezra during an interview
with the Israeli State-run radio. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ominous thing is that these threats ought to be taken very seriously
since Ezra&#146;s views to this effect are in line with those of Sharon, who had proposed
even more Draconian and sweeping retaliations against Palestinian activists and leaders. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Quid pro quo</b></u><br>
Although the Palestinian bus driver who carried out the attack near Tel Aviv on 14
February insisted that he acted alone and that he had no formal or informal association
with any Palestinian political group, some circles within the Israeli security
establishment have warned that the Palestinians, especially the three main groups active
in the intifada (Fatah, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad), were increasingly adopting a policy
of quid pro quo toward Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This assessment sees to be true. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the murder of Madani in Nablus, Hamas officials vowed to
retaliate &#147;sooner rather than later.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Hamas will avenge the blood of its sons; the Zionists should realize
that shedding our blood will inevitably lead to shedding their blood; our blood is not
water and it will not go un-avenged,&#148; said Jamal Salim, Hamas spokesman in Nablus. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salim pointed out that the Palestinian people succeeded in putting up a
solid response to Israeli bellicosity and blatant aggression. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have exposed them by proving that they are against the very
existence of the Palestinian people. In the past they claimed that they were against a
specific segment of the Palestinian people, namely the so-called &#147;extremists,&#148;
but now it seems that the entire Palestinian people have become extremists in the
Zionists&#146; eyes&#133;solely because we want to be free from their diabolical military
occupation.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Murderous rampage continues unabated</b></u><br>
The murder of Madani is added to the murderous killing of seven other Palestinian
civilians on the weekend&#151;six in the Hebron area and the seventh, a PA officer in the
Tulkarm region. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, 16 February, Israeli occupation army soldiers stationed on
hilltops overlooking a dairy farm on the northern outskirts of Hebron, fired artillery
shells and heavy machine-gun rounds of the 900-mm calibre killing two workers: Shaker
Manasra, 25, married and father of two children, and Ahmed Farajallah, 32, and father of
four. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few hours earlier, the Israeli army, ferociously and indiscriminately,
shelled nearly five Hebron neighbourhoods in what townspeople described as a situation
&#147;similar to the what Sarajevo was subjected to during the Bosnian war.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The blind shelling and strafing with heavy machine-guns lasted for five
hours, leaving Isam Rasheed al-Tawil, 29, who was watching TV with his children inside
their home, dead and several other people injured. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the same time, an Israeli army jeep opened fire on a group of
Palestinian labourers who were returning home from work inside Israel, killing one
worker&#151;26-year-old Muhammed Ismael Hawamdeh. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The continued shelling of civilian neighbourhoods in the West Bank, along
with the reportedly certified use by the Israeli army of nerve gas, including phosgene and
a mild variety of the deadly gas Sarin, demonstrates that the Israeli political-military
establishment is willing to go to any extent to suppress the Palestinians&#146; legitimate
yearning for freedom from Israel&#146;s enduring occupation and domination. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, this policy of vindictive subjugation barely clouds a
collective Israeli contempt of Palestinian lives. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The brutal ugliness of this mentality is not confined to shooting nerve
gas into crowded streets in Khan Younis or killing workers at a dairy farm in Hebron. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 February, the Israeli Prison Authority decided to free a Jewish
terrorist murderer who in 1993 murdered the hand-cuffed and leg-fettered Palestinian, Musa
Abu Sabha, at a Jewish settlement near Hebron. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1994, Shkolnik was convicted of the premeditated murder of Abu Sabha
and was sentenced to life imprisonment. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, former President Ezer Weisman twice commuted his sentence,
reducing it to just 11 years. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The court cited &#147;good behavior&#148; as the reason for freeing

Baghdad</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b><br>
Palestinians at all levels strongly condemned British and American aerial bombing of the
Iraqi capital Baghdad on 16 February, which resulted in the death of three Iraqi civilians
and inflicted heavy material damage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Authority officials denounced the bombing as
&#147;vicious&#148; and &#147;totally unjustified&#148; and opined that it was meant
&#147;to cover up the criminal Zionist aggression against our people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA Legislative Council member, Ahmed Qrei, said in a solidarity letter to
his Iraqi counterpart, National Council Speaker Sa&#146;adoun Hamadi, that &#147;the
Palestinian people were identifying with Iraq, its people and its leadership, against
American aggression.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, popular forces in the West Bank and Gaza as well as in
1948-Palestine also expressed their outrage at the bombing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas official in Nablus, Jamal Mansour, said the Anglo-American bombing
was &#147;a reassertion of Western enmity of Arabs and Islam,&#148; adding that there were
not any real justifications for the bombing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They are just bullying a decimated people and a bombed-out country
in order to assert or reassert their enmity of the Arab nation and of Islam.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same theme was voiced by other Palestinian groups that viewed the
bombing as part of the overall American policy toward the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This criminal bombing amounts to a blatant aggression not only
against Iraq but against the entire Arab nation,&#148; said Hussein Rahal, head of the
pro-Iraqi Arab Liberation Front.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He called on Arab masses to exert pressure on Arab regimes to end official
silence and lend support to the Iraqi people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Nablus, the West Bank&#146;s largest town, hundreds of Palestinian
activists from various political orientations took part in a rally in solidarity with
Iraq.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Participants carried signs condemning the American bombing and calling on
Arab and Muslim masses to show solidarity with the Iraqi people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One speaker called on political leaders in the region to boycott the
upcoming visit to the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another speaker argued that the real aim of the bombing was to divert
attention from the ongoing bloody rampage carried out by Israeli occupation troops against
the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Additional demonstrations against the bombing were organized throughout
the occupied territories almost on a daily basis during which American, Zionist and
occasionally British flags were torched.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been gaining popularity among many
Palestinians recently, especially since the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada or
uprising, mainly owing to his generous financial &#147;gifts&#148; to the families of
Palestinian martyrs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Iraq offered the sum of $10,000 to each martyr&#146;s family and $3,000 to
each Palestinian seriously injured in the nearly 5-month-old uprising.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Americans ask Powell to spend a night with<br>
Palestinians to experience Israeli savagery </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> A group of American citizens living in Palestine,
calling themselves &#147;Americans for Justice in Palestine&#148;, have called on U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell to spend one night in any West Bank town of his choice to
experience Israeli savagery firsthand.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The group published an open letter to that effect Sunday, 25 February,
bearing the title, &#147;An open invitation to Mr. Secretary of State Colin Powell to
spend one night under the Israeli military occupation&#148; before meeting Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Dear Secretary Powell: We Americans living in PA-controlled areas
would like to invite you to spend one night in a Palestinian town of your
choice&#151;Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nablus, al-Khalil or Gaza&#151;to see for
yourself our taxpayer money in the field.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The letter went on saying, rather sarcastically, &#147;the programme is
full of fun, and includes: a live show of American-supplied Apache helicopter gun-ships in
action against civilians, a sightseeing tour through bypass roads around us, which
includes a live show of armed settlers in the field.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The letter concluded that &#147;we direct your attention to the fact that
a diplomatic post or American citizenship do not guarantee immunity against Israeli
savagery. For more information, contact United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights
Mary Robinson or George Mitchell, Head of the International Fact Finding Mission.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear if Powell, who met with Arafat in Ramallah on Sunday, saw
the letter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has been launching a sustained campaign of violent and bloody
rampages against Palestinians in the West Bank, causing the death of over 400
Palestinians, mostly minors and children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians hope to end 33 years of military Israeli occupation that
is mainly supported and sustained by massive American financial, economic and military
assistance to the Zionist regime.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Statement of Participants in Sabeel&#146;s <br>
Solidarity Gathering in Jerusalem</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We Christians, Jews and Muslims from over 20 countries have come to
Sabeel&#146;s Alternative Assembly in Palestine to stand in solidarity with our
Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring the yoke of occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabeel is an ecumenical Christian centre for Palestinian Liberation
Theology, which seeks to make the Gospel contextually relevant. Sabeel, which in Arabic
means both &#147;the way&#148; and &#147;spring of life-giving water,&#148; strives to
develop a spirituality based on justice, peace, non-violence, liberation and
reconciliation for the different national and faith communities. In doing so, it
encourages us to work for a just, comprehensive and enduring peace informed by truth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears...&#148; the
pattern of the pervasive control and domination by Israel which is causing widespread
suffering and reflecting the injustices faced by the Palestinian people. The Oslo
&#147;peace process&#148; has failed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Deepening our understanding and gaining fresh insights, we can only
conclude that peace is a real possibility if, and only if, justice is achieved. Toward
this end, we affirm the timely Principles for a Just Peace in Palestine-Israel, that is,
the Jerusalem Sabeel Document of May 2000.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We therefore note with deep sadness that the failed &#147;peace
process&#148; has resulted in: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Entrenching a new and harsh form of occupation of Gaza and the West Bank (which includes
    East Jerusalem). The occupation is violence. </li>
  <li>A dramatic increase in the expansion of settlements, construction of bypass roads and
    control of territory by settlers, and other &#147;facts on the ground.&#148; </li>
  <li>Allowing, in practice, through closure and rapid settlement building in East Jerusalem
    the isolation of Jerusalem from Palestinian life in Gaza and the West Bank and her
    transformation into a closed city. </li>
  <li>A de facto apartheid system of Palestinian life in the occupied territories, with the
    populated areas carved up into &#147;bantustans.&#148; </li>
  <li>Gross violations of basic human rights, intensified in recent months. </li>
  <li>A new phase of extreme Israeli violence, including use of heavy artillery against
    civilians, causing over 15,000 injuries in addition to over 400 deaths in only the last
    five months. </li>
  <li>Severe damage to the Palestinian economy while giving Israel control and domination over
    that economy. </li>
  <li>Further threat to the continued existence of the Christian community in Palestine by
    creating circumstances that encourage emigration.</li>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The continued violence and control by Israel over an oppressed population
  presents the greatest risk to the State of Israel; justice is the only hope for Israelis
  and Palestinians. Justice undergirds a durable peace, which will offer security for all in
  Palestine and Israel. A new and just process must be established which returns to the
  principles of international law, resulting in: </p>
  <li>The immediate implementation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel and most
    of our countries are signatories, and which applies to the West Bank and Gaza, to be
    upheld by international peace-keepers. </li>
  <li>Implementation of UN Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 1322, which will
    terminate the occupation and its violence. </li>
  <li>The return and compensation of all refugees who so choose, in accordance with UN
    resolution 194. </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Justice also requires an acknowledgement by Israel of al-Nakba (the
Catastrophe of 1948), followed by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission as an instrument
of healing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We pledge ourselves to identify and then challenge the structures of
domination in Israel and Palestine and in our own countries, including those that supply
armaments as well as financial and political aid which support the injustice in Palestine.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We affirm our commitment to strive for the realization of a just peace, in
solidarity with all who seek a just peace based on our faith that all can be redeemed and
reconciled in Christ. With Sabeel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We will stand for justice. We can do no other. Justice alone guarantees a
peace that will lead to reconciliation and a life of security and prosperity to all the
peoples of our land. By standing on the side of justice, we open ourselves to the work of
peace; and working for peace makes us children of God. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>A Jewish terrorist leader with close ties to
religious and right-wing circles in the Zionist regime has urged Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ariel Sharon to &#147;liquidate&#148; Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrorist leader, Shlomo Helper who heads the Council of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, was quoted as saying that &#147;Arafat is an
adversary not an ally, and in Judaism adversaries should be destroyed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, no Israeli official has condemned the call, which was reported
widely by the Israeli media.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian official Sa&#146;eb Ureikat described the call as &#147;very
grave.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The world must understand the need to stop Israel&#146;s
State-sponsored terrorism against the defenseless Palestinian population. The call to
assassinate President Arafat is very grave and it shouldn&#146;t be allowed to pass
quietly,&#148; the Palestinian official told the PA radio station, the &#147;Voice of
Palestine,&#148; on Monday, 26 February.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday, 25 February, Arafat accused the Israeli government of
preventing him from traveling from and to the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell that had it not been
for Jordan&#146;s King Abdullah who lent Arafat his own plane, he wouldn&#146;t have been
able to fly to Ramallah from Jordan for the meeting with Powell.</p>

unnecessarily</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- Haifa Mayor Abraham Mitsna&#146;a admitted during
a lecture near Haifa that the killing of 13 Palestinians of the Palestinian community in
&#147;Israel&#148; was &#147;unjustified&#148; and &#147;done without a valid
reason.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mitsna&#146;a&#146;s belated admission came during a reception at the
Palestinian village of Ilabun in upper Galilee. Mitsna&#146;a, a former army general,
suggested that the 13 &#147;Israeli Palestinians&#148; were killed because of their
non-Jewish ethnicity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mayor of Haifa pointed out that the &#147;painful episode&#148;
seriously disrupted &#147;Arab-Jewish relations&#148; in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the first week of October of 2000, Israeli police forces and the
so-called border police, acting on instructions from the Nazi-like police chief Alex Ron,
shot dead 13 Palestinian youngsters and youths during demonstrations protesting the
provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque by Ariel Sharon, then head of the Israeli

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- The Zionist regime decided to free a settler
murderer, who seven years ago murdered a Palestinian from the village of Housan near
Bethlehem, citing &#147;good behaviour.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli State-run radio said the Israeli Prison Authority decided to
free Yoram Shkolnek after he served two thirds of his sentence for murdering a hand-cuffed
and leg-fettered Palestinian at an Israeli army post near the village of Yatta, 15
kilometres southwest of Hebron, in 1993.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Authority cited good behaviour as the reason for commuting the
sentence and pardoning the settler murderer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israelis who murder Palestinians normally receive extremely light prison
sentences and often are freed after serving a few years or even months.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier last month, another settler who murdered the Palestinian boy Helmi
Shousha at the village of Housan near Bethlehem in 1996 was sentenced to &#147;five months
of community service&#148; for the murder.</p>
