<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Palestinian State and the 4 May
&#145;Bug&#146;</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Mahmoud al-Khatib</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year the world will witness two determinative events that have a
direct relation to time. The first is known as the &#145;Y2K Bug&#146;; computer experts
warn that the globe will be destroyed during the first minute of the new year 2000 if
Uncle Sam&#146;s technology fails to find an urgent solution to this bug before the end of
this year. The other is the &#145;4 May Bug&#146;; Chairman Arafat is expected to declare
his Palestinian State on this date, which marks the end of the five-year transitional
period of self-rule.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we are fully confident that Uncle Sam will find a solution to the
Y2K Bug, we are full of horror at the outcome of Mr. Arafat&#146;s Statehood declaration.
For he toured the four corners of the globe in order to secure for himself the real title
of &#147;President&#148; and to record his funeral, which seems to be imminent, in the
annals of the funerals of the &#147;Greatest Presidents&#148;!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth of May, as Mr. Arafat&#146;s subordinates say, is a sacred
date for declaring the State, at least this is what they have been claiming for a long
time now. Yes, it is sacred as long as Chairman, sorry, President Arafat wishes to call
it. But what would his poor subordinates say if Mr. Arafat gave them the cold shoulder and
decided to adjourn the Statehood declaration? For he received the same tone and same reply
from the world leaders he met with during his last tour. They all advised him to postpone
the Statehood declaration until after 4 May. By the time the date actually rolls around,
it is expected that Mr. Arafat will adjourn it for six months. This means that the
Palestinian bug will coincide with the Y2K Bug. At least one bug is better than two!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinians have earned the right to have their hearts in their
mouths with the approach of 4 May. Although they have not yet tasted the State and have
never experienced independence in their recent history, they have been feeling its bites
and burns since 1994 when the PA&#146;s leadership came from Tunis to Gaza. They are aware
that under Mr. Arafat and his henchmen the newly born State would be hell. The
Palestinians have the following impressionistic image of this State:</p>

<p>- A president who flies around the globe and has his term extended every 50 years in
order to get a lifetime presidency, and whose main hobby is walking on red carpets at
international airports parading the honour guard.</p>

<p>- A full jailhouse in every Palestinian town and refugee camp competing with each other
on offering a five-star service to their &#145;guests&#146;. Such a service has not been
introduced to Palestinian political detainees even by the Zionist enemies as was testified
to by some international human rights bodies.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; Widespread corruption decaying the civil and security bodies.</p>

<p>- Tribalism, which had not been experienced by the Palestinian People until those who
came from Tunis brought it with them to stop the Islamist stream in the occupied
territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no need to deeply explore the geo-political form of the State
after the Palestinian &#145;bug&#146;. It is a State, but not a State; an entity but not
that entity. It is a new form of a State that has no counterpart. It is even not expected
to have a counterpart until the day of final judgement. But Arafat&#146;s model State is
fragmented atomic islands in a sea of Jewish settlements in the West Bank without
geographic or political borders; without geographic or demographic unity among its
fragmented units; without sovereignty; without natural resources but survives by American
and European assistance; and with masked and real unemployment in all sectors except in
the ten security bodies which serve the interests of the Zionist enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arafat&#146;s story with the Palestinian State is similar to the
parable of <i>Juha</i> and the Sultan: <i>Juha </i>wants his son to marry the
Sultan&#146;s daughter. <i>Juha</i>, his wife and his son have no objection to this
marriage, but the Sultan, his wife and his daughter strongly reject it! Just like Arafat,
the Arabs and their poor friends want the Palestinian State to be established, but those
who are concerned and have the power&#151;namely Israel, the United States and the West in
general&#151;do not want it and they even suppressed the Palestinian <i>Juha</i> before
daring to ask for the bride&#146;s hand.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the PA establish the State by force even though it abandoned the
gun, which is the detrimental element in the struggle between the Right and Falsehood? Can
this State be created by giving more Palestinian sacrifices to the Israelis and by
arresting more Palestinians? Or can it be accomplished by giving more relinquishments
regarding Palestinian land and legitimate rights? It is clear that the PA does not have a
will to force its option because it is convinced of its disability. However, the
Palestinian Authority can celebrate a real wedding only by releasing its people from
jails, by reconciliation with its people, by clearing its security bodies of the
collaboration with the Israeli Shin Bet, and by declaring a national <i>Jihad</i>
programme to liberate the occupied land without rushing to get trifle fruits.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Israel&#146;s goal is to liquidate the Palestinian Cause and close
the file after 50 years of battling to establish a Jewish foothold in Palestine, then
surely the path they have taken thus far will realize that end. For Israel today is
stronger than yesterday and free of external pressures that would want it to abide by its
agreements with the PLO. The Jewish and Zionist lobbies in the United States and inside
the White House are acting on its behalf. Therefore, the Palestinians should not let their
legs be dragged into the Zionist swamp.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the three candidates&#151;Netanyahu, Barak and Mordechai&#151;of
the Israeli elections agree upon is not an ordinary Palestinian State, but rather a newly
created form of relation with Jordan that is not available in the present political
dictionaries. It is neither a confederation nor a federation. Israel wants to form an
entity in which the Palestinians are scattered throughout their lands and in diaspora
while holding Jordanian passports so that their lands can continue to be usurped by the
machinery of the Jewish settlements. In other words, and regardless of the Jordanian
rejection of this relation because of its destructive consequences on Jordan itself,
Israel wants to create a Jordanian supremacy over the Palestinian People, and an Israeli
supremacy over the Palestinian land. This is what any Israeli government agrees on and
blesses, not the 4 May&#146;s bug!</p>

for nothing</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</i></b><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has apparently succumbed
to American pressure and decided to postpone the declaration of Palestinian Statehood,
originally designated for the fourth of May when the interim phase of the Oslo process
comes to an end.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arafat had hoped for some sort of American &#147;guarantees and
assurances&#148; that would help him save face before his people whom he repeatedly
promised to declare Statehood on the fourth of May.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that purpose, the Palestinian leader visited the United States on
23 March and held talks at the White House with President Clinton and his top aides.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Arafat was reportedly disappointed by the American response to
his pleas for &#147;assurances and guarantees&#148;, and, therefore, decided to mobilize
further support for the Palestinian people&#146;s right to self-determination and
Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seeing that the American tune was not harmonious with the Palestinian
song, Arafat had reduced his rhetoric concerning &#147;Statehood&#148; to a mere plea to
fill &#147;the political vacuum&#148; likely to arise at the end of the interim period of
the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving Washington virtually empty-handed, Arafat decided to send his
deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) back to Washington in mid-April to try to &#147;formulate
a common American-Palestinian approach to the issue of Statehood.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, reports from Washington suggested that the Americans were not
willing to give Abu Mazen (viewed by the Israelis as the most dove-ish of all PA leaders)
more than they had given to Arafat, namely some words of praise for the Palestinian
commitment to the peace process and the various security agreements with Israel, and a
renewed American commitment to bankroll the PA, whose coffers have been emptied by
embezzlement, corruption and financial mismanagement. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it seemed Arafat did not want to put all his eggs in the
American basket this time, or at the very least wanted to give an impression as such to
the Americans.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In April, the Palestinian leader, probably the most peripatetic person
in the world, flew from one country to the other in a bid to win recognition for
Palestinian Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He visited as many as 20 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia,
appealing to his hosts to recognize a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
once it is declared.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not clear how valuable this &#147;verbal support&#148; will be,
especially if taken into account the fact that most of the States he visited had already
supported the previous declaration of Statehood which was made by the PLO in Algeria in
1988. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PA retreats</b></u><br>
It is clear by now that the question concerning the issue of Statehood is no longer
whether there will be a postponement or not, but rather for how long that postponement
will be, or, indeed, will it be open-ended as the American administration seems to
suggest.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, while Arafat has not formally and openly said he would postpone
the declaration of Statehood, statements to that end by his parroting aides have shifted
180 degrees in less than a week.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those aides and &#147;ministers&#148;, who only a week ago vowed that
there would not be any postponement of the Statehood declaration, have begun to speak of
&#147;our alienable right to Statehood,&quot; while deliberately dropping the declaration
of Statehood from their statements.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ahmed Abdul Rahman, whom Arafat gave the title &#147;minister without
portfolio&#148;, said in a Gaza seminar on the subject of Statehood on 22 April that the
declaration of Statehood was contingent upon a set of certain factors, and once these
factors are at hand, &#147;We will declare Statehood today.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abdul Rahman did not say what these factors were, but it was amply
clear that what he had in mind was &#147;American recognition&#148; or, at least, American
tacit approval.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abdul Rahman claimed that the last thing the PA was concerned about was
a probable Israeli veto of a Palestinian State.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it was the Israeli objection, or more correctly, Israeli veto,
which is often disguised as &#147;American reservation&#148;, that has so far determined
Arafat&#146;s words as well as actions with disastrous implications to the Palestinian
people and their national interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, this happened all along, in Cairo, Taba, Hebron, and
finally miserably in Wye Plantation, when Arafat succumbed to Netanyahu&#146;s concerted
efforts to &#147;lower Palestinian expectations to next to nothing&#148;, as Netanyahu
boasted on many occasions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, the problem with Yasser Arafat is that he is willing and ready to
do just about anything to secure American support for Palestinian Statehood. Hence, Arafat
continued to &#147;honour Palestinian commitments under the Wye agreement&#148;, often by
rounding up hundreds of Palestinian citizens and throwing them behind bars for many months
without charge or trial, only to appease the Americans and please the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is done, despite and in the shadow of the frenzied Israeli land
grab in the West Bank, which observers say is unprecedented since the signing of the Oslo
Accords more than five years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the face of all of this, the United States does little more than
just entertaining Arafat and asking him to be patient, and, significantly, demanding that
he fulfill his &#147;security obligations&#148; <i>vis-�-vis</i> Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And with Arafat playing the role of &#147;the good mama&#146;s
boy&#148;, e.g. accepting everything the U.S. does, the Israelis will complete their
scheme of &#147;finding indelible facts on the ground&#148; until there is little or
nothing to be worried about in case a Palestinian State is announced, because then it will
be a State without substance, without much land, and with a lot of hollow symbols.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Rejection of the UN Partition Plan</font></b><font SIZE="2"><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</font><i><b>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Musil J Shihadeh*</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to examine here the much talked about Israeli myth that
the Palestinian tragedy was a result of their rejecting UN resolution 181 for the
Partition of Palestine. In other words, what would have happened had the Palestinians and
the Arabs accepted the UN Partition Plan of resolution 181. Would Israel have accepted in
good faith the same resolution and implemented it with good intentions?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To keep Israel&#146;s image unblemished in the eyes of the world and to
dismiss the contention that Israel was born in sin, Zionist apologists blame all the
tragedies that befell the Palestinians on their rejection of the UN Partition Plan as
embodied in resolution 181 of 29 November 1947. Such a theme would cloak Israel with
urgently needed morality, and would justify Israel&#146;s atrocities, massacres and the
uprooting of the Palestinians in the war of 1947-1948 in order to take over their land. In
retrospect, the Zionists claim that if the Palestinians had accepted the UN Partition Plan
as the Zionist leadership did, none of the miseries that took place during the period
1947-1948 would have taken place&#151;no wars, no victims, no refugees, no land
expropriations&#151;and the two peoples would have enjoyed peaceful coexistence for the
last 50 years! </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the risk of intruding into the realm of speculation, let me explore
the possibilities that could have evolved had the Palestinians and the Arabs accepted the
UN resolution in its entirety. If however, the early Zionist plans were unveiled prior to
the establishment of the State of Israel and if what had taken place on the ground was
objectively compared with these plans, one would have to come to the inescapable
conclusion that most of the Israeli premeditated plans involved violating resolution 181
in favour of acquiring as much land as possible while at the same time evicting the
indigenous Palestinians from the same land. Let&#146;s keep in mind here that the UN
Partition Plan divided Palestine into approximately 55% for the Jewish State and 45% for
the Arab State, even though the Arabs actually owned at least 90% of the land and
represented a two-thirds majority of the population (<i>Israel&#151;An Apartheid State</i>,
by Uri Davis, chapter 1; The UN Commission on Palestine; JNF records; and the Israeli
custodian of absentee properties established 1950). I would also like to point out here
that the UN Partition prohibited the forced transfer of any inhabitant from any sector to
the other. Assuming then that Israel was genuine and honest about accepting the UN
Partition, the long-sought objective of establishing a Jewish State would become a farce,
since any way you divide it, Palestine had an Arab majority population. It would be very
hard to believe that a Jewish State would be named as such if the majority of the
inhabitants in that sector were non-Jewish. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the above, let us assume that a democratic Jewish State
was established. In this case, the Arab majority would vote for Arab representatives to be
placed in the Jewish Parliament and for an Arab for the position of Prime
Minister&#151;after all, no one can deny that in a free democratic society the majority
rule. Aside from the name, the Jewish State would be in effect an Arab government with the
majority of its inhabitants being also Arab. Since the UN Partition stipulates very
clearly that no one from either sector would be dispossessed from his land, except for the
common welfare, there would be no place for new Jewish immigration as most of the lands
were under Arab ownership and control. Therefore, the UN Partition, if implemented
honestly, would make the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine nearly an impossible
Jewish dream. Hence, to cling persistently to the actual establishment of a viable Jewish
State, two preconditions had to be fulfilled: the expropriation of land from the
indigenous Arabs and the devising of a system under which the Arab majority would become a
minority. Since it would be ludicrous, if not insane, to expect anybody volunteering to
give his land and property away in exchange for becoming a miserable refugee, somebody
else has to do the job. In order for the Zionist leadership, then, to establish the Jewish
State in a land whose majority of people and land are Arab, it has no other choice but to
use force to evict the Arabs and take over their land and properties as many Jewish
sources confirm. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simha Flapan, Benny Morris, Ilan Pappe, Professor N. Neuberger and
Norman Finkelstein are a few of the Israeli historians who confirm such a view. In fact,
the uprooting of the Palestinians the result of premeditated plans with the Zionist
leadership as far back as 1930, when even Ben-Gurion favoured the transfer of Palestinians
in order to create a viable Jewish State. Mr. Yoram Ben Porath of the JNF and a Zionist
leader exposes this further when he stated on 14 July 1972 (<i>Yediot Aaronoth</i>) that
there is no such thing as Zionism, as colonization by the Jewish State, without the
eviction of the Arabs and the expropriation of their lands! Haim Weizman (<i>Exile and
Return</i>, page 117) concurs with a similar view when he stated that Israel should be as
Jewish as England is English! Joseph Weitz, Deputy chairman of the JNF (1951-1973), stated
as early as 1940:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;</font>Among ourselves
    it must be clear that there is no place in the country for both peoples together...With
    the Arabs we shall not achieve our aim of being independent people in this country. The
    only solution is Eretz Israel, at least the west part of Eretz Israel, without Arabs...and
    there is no other way but to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries,
    transfer all of them, not one village or tribe should remain, and the transfer must aim at
    Iraq, Syria and even Transjordan. For this purpose money will be found, much money; and
    only with this transfer could the country absorb millions of our brothers. There is no
    other alternative...One should investigate now the neighbouring countries in order to
    determine their capacity to absorb the Arabs of Eretz Israel.&#148;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It&#146;s no wonder, therefore, that plans such as Nachsen, Misparayim,
Galilee, Dalet and others were prepared before the war to cleanse the Arabs from the
entire Jewish sector. It is no wonder that massacres and uprooting took place in Deir
Yassin, Haifa, Jaffa, Safad, West Jerusalem and hundreds of others to make sure that the
Jewish State becomes indeed very Jewish! Mr. Rabin in his memoirs has also confirmed how
he participated in the eviction of almost 60,000 unprotected Arab civilians in Lud and
Ramleh after surrendering to the Zionist forces. He ordered that they start walking toward
the East&#151;women, children and old people! </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have read the history of wars, which established an undeniable
fact that most occupiers take over control of the country with their military presence,
but how many would evict the indigenous people and replace them with their own people? In
Palestine, the Zionists could not create a Jewish State while the majority of the people
were not Jewish, as stated by the Israeli historian Benny Morris: &#147;Any way you divide
it, you would have a fifth column&#148;, he stated in an interview with Dan Perry, the
associated press (16 December 1997).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, if the Zionist claim is true, that the eviction took place
because of the Palestinian rejection of the UN Partition, why would Israel practice
similar evictions when the war was over and everybody was settled? Can Israeli history
deny the expulsion of the inhabitants of Ikrit in Western Galilee and the village of Rama
in 1949? Can Israel deny that on 5 November 1949 they evicted by force the inhabitants of
K&#146;far Anan from their homes and forced them to cross the borders into the West Bank?
How about the forced evictions of the 700 inhabitants of K&#146;far Yusuf on 28 February
1951, long after the 1948 war, who were loaded onto trucks and dumped on the Jordanian
border? Should we thank the Israelis for supplying the transportation? Actually, in
February of 1951 alone, the inhabitants of more than 13 villages were transported out of
their homes and dumped on the Jordanian borders! Do all these forced evictions lend any
credibility to the Israeli claim that it was not within the Zionist plans to evict the
Palestinians? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further proof of Zionist immoral history in Palestine is the Israeli
practices in the West Bank. The expropriation of lands, the evictions, the demolitions,
and the cruel military rule do not point to the illegal and immoral behaviour of the
Zionists alone, but they confirm the evil practices of the past. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using the same logic now, are the evictions to be continued because we
are now rejecting the further partitioning of whatever is left of our homes and our lands?
Are we to be &#147;punished&#148; again by further evictions for rejecting to be evicted? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was normal for the Palestinians as much as for any people on this
earth to reject the UN Partition, which allots the best part of their lands to foreign
intruders, but what is not normal is to &#147;punish&#148; them so severely for such a
normal attitude, by disinheriting them and turning them into tragic refugees. To claim
that Israel should not accept them back in conformity with so many UN resolutions
including the UN Partition because they might pose as a fifth column is an exercise in
theatrics, because those Arabs who stayed did not become a fifth or a fourth column for
that matter. The hard-core fact of the matter is that Israel was born in sin; it robbed
the indigenous Palestinians of their homes and properties, and then claimed to the world
in a very obvious chutzpah that it was the Palestinians&#146; fault. It&#146;s like the
convicted thief who does not stop stealing but resents being called a thief. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should behoove Israel and its allies to realize that success in
fooling the world would not bring it any closer to any real peace, as the proof lies in
the non-peaceful status quo. To address the victims and to tell the truth of what has
taken place might be the only first step toward real peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</p>
</i></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The five-year transitional period envisaged by the Oslo project has
finally come to an end. It leaves in its wake a dark legacy of broken promises and
political betrayal. Troubled as it were by a conflict between Israeli interpretation on
the one hand and Palestinian compliance on the other, the project stumbled from one crisis
to another. All told, the current crisis has arisen not so much from the powerlessness of
the Palestinians as from Israel&#146;s refusal to accept the principles of negotiation
that are necessary for peace. This was evidently illustrated in the letter written by
foreign minister Ariel Sharon to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan one week after the
signing of the Wye Memorandum. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having gained Israel&#146;s existence through the direct sponsorship
and favour of the UN, it seemed natural that the newly appointed Israeli minister would
reaffirm his country&#146;s gratitude and indebtedness to the World Body. On the contrary,
Sharon wrote, &#147;Israel expects that the General Assembly will not put forth
resolutions that prejudge the outcome of the final status negotiations, including the
issue of Statehood. Moreover, I would like to express our view that anachronistic and
outdated resolutions recycled and readopted by the Assembly year after year, which no
longer reflect present realities and achievements, should be finally removed from the
annual agenda and relegated to the legacy of the past.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although many observers in New York felt that the letter did not
warrant a reply, the Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, Naseer al-Kidwa, quickly condemned
it as a crude attempt by Israel to (once again) &#147;defy international law and relevant
United Nations resolutions.&#148; These resolutions mainly refer to Jerusalem, the
refugees, settlements, borders, human rights, Palestinian self-determination, and
permanent sovereignty over the natural resources in the occupied territories.
Sharon&#146;s impassioned plea to revoke them confirmed a view which the opponents of Oslo
have voiced consistently for years: that being the Israelis are neither committed to nor
interested in a negotiated settlement based on international law. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On account of that, their presumption is one which maintains that there
is no Palestinian territory. Hence, they do not acknowledge that Israel is an occupying
power in the West Bank, Gaza Strip or Jerusalem. To them, the West Bank and Gaza Strip is
not Palestinian territory, rather it is Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza &#145;<font FACE="Times New Roman">'</font> district&#146;. In other words, there was no Palestine.
The only Palestinian territory they recognize is that which lies east of the Jordan river.
This, no doubt, is one of the most dangerous obstacles to peace in our region. The
unwillingness of the occupier to dismantle his settlements, withdraw from the territories,
restore the <i>status quo ante</i> 1967 in Jerusalem, and allow the refugees to return are
obvious clues to their real intentions. Perhaps the aging foreign minister should be
reminded that even if the Palestinian Authority (PA) signs an unjust settlement, as he
expects, it would not be final because only a just solution can be permanent.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transition and settlements</b></u><br>
Admittedly, the concept of a transitional period to Statehood is nothing new to the
Palestinians. It was proposed as early as May 1939 in the British White Paper, which
declared that &#147;The objective of His Majesty&#146;s Government is the establishment
within ten years of an independent Palestine State&#133;&#148; And on other constitutional
matters, the Paper also affirmed that &#147;His Majesty&#146;s Government therefore now
declares unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a
Jewish State.&#148; Sixty years having been spent on realizing the goals of Palestinian
nationalism remain largely unaccomplished, albeit with one fundamental change: that being
whereas in 1939 they had to contend with a single colonial power&#151;namely
Britain&#151;today they have to engage other hegemonic forces in the United States,
Europe, and their regional protectorate Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to the views expressed by former Secretary of State James
Baker that the transitional period would usher in a change of attitude that demonstrates a
commitment to peace, the Oslo years have facilitated the intensification of Israeli
settlement in the occupied territories. This was, of course, well in accordance with the
foundation plan drawn up by Baker [and his senior aide Dennis Ross] and which the former
presented to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in May 1989, ostensibly
for approval before it became national policy. On that occasion, Baker advised that the
future settlement of the conflict should be directed toward the attainment of a
&#147;reasonable&#148; compromise between Israeli annexation of the West Bank and Gaza and
Palestinian Statehood in the area. This formula, he argued, provided ample scope for the
Palestinians to realize their full political rights as well as for Israeli security. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Baker did not remain in charge at the State Department long
after this, the core of his ideas were largely adopted by the Oslo project. While the
transitional period denied the Palestinians sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, it
enabled Israel to continue enjoying the fruits of its conquests there. In its relentless
campaign to minimize the size of territory under Palestinian control, Israel increased the
overall number of its settlers in the West Bank and Gaza by 12% between December 1996 and
June 1998. Thus it now remains on the eve of the new millennium the only country in the
world that is still expanding its frontiers and settling its citizens in the conquered
lands. Sharon&#146;s call to Jewish settlers on 15 November 1998 to &#147;grab&#148;
unoccupied West Bank land so it does not fall under PA control reveals the depth of
Israeli contempt for the rule of law. Given the fact that the UN International War Crimes
Tribunal maintains that the construction of settlements in occupied territories is a war
crime, the PA should, under the current circumstances, seriously consider legal action
against both the Israeli and U.S. governments. Surely without the latter&#146;s financial
support Israel would not have been able to allocate $2.6 billion for the settlement of
800,000 Jews in the West Bank by the year 2010. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shifting Europe</b></u><br>
As the conflict enters this advanced and critical stage after Oslo, all the signs confirm
that its final resolution will not be determined behind the closed doors of the Security
Council. The dispossessed Palestinians who have been the victims of Zionist colonization
since the dawn of the twentieth century are determined to play no less a role than their
political leaders in defining the course of their history. Their monumental losses and
suffering over the years have left them with an undying faith that only the full
restoration of their rights will suffice. They have learned through bitter experience that
the value of international agreements lies not only in their content but more importantly
in their implementation. For this reason, they jealously reserve their right of veto on
all matters which affect their higher national interests. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Endowed as they are with one of the highest literacy rates outside the
industrialized world, the Palestinians are, on the whole, very capable of distinguishing
between empty official rhetoric and meaningful political practice. Hence, their cautious
welcome of the March 1999 declaration by the Heads of Government of the European Union
affirming support for the &#147;unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination
including the option of a State.&#148; Though cloaked in attractive language, the
declaration was, nonetheless, typical of the inconsistency that has been a feature of
European policy toward the Palestinian cause. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significantly, while Brussels was proclaiming its support for the
inalienable rights of the Palestinians, it was at the same time conferring upon Israel
membership to its four-year Research and Development Programme. Previously, the EU had
stubbornly withheld membership to Israel until progress was made on implementing the Wye
memorandum. The March 1999 decision to reverse this policy has effectively cleared the way
for the Jewish State to compete for research projects worth $16.4 billion. This sudden
about-face by the EU will further undermine trust and erode confidence among the
Palestinians. Their only explanation to this development is that since the Europeans would
like to appear even-handed and impartial in their approach to the conflict, they could not
support the legitimate right of the Palestinians to Statehood without offering concessions
to Israel; even while the latter continues to violate its international treaty
obligations! </p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where to</u>?</b><br>
And what of the research funds? Will the environmentally conscious Europeans insist that
it be used to save the holy land from pollution and destruction? Or, will they pander to
Israeli &#147;security needs&#148; and allow it to be used for the development of weapons
of mass destruction? At a time when there are no recycling bins for bottles, cans,
plastics, or batteries in Jerusalem. Given their historic religious and cultural interests
in this city, circumstances demand that the Europeans must do all within their power to
stop the annual disposal of 3.5 million tons of untreated waste into landfills in
Jerusalem. For how much longer will the occupying power be allowed to dump industrial
waste, including poisonous heavy metals and salts, directly into the environment, damaging
underground aquifers, rivers and streams? Surely by turning the financial and economic
screws on Israel the EU can effectively play a major role in reversing this deadly trend
and, likewise, protect its own interests in the holy land. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the end, the issue is not about financial assistance, great or
small. To the Palestinians it is a matter no less fundamental than that outlined by the
founding fathers in the American Declaration of Independence. That &#147;people seek
historically that separate and equal status among the powers of the earth to which the
laws of nature and nature&#146;s God entitle them.&#148; Unlike the usurpers of their
land, they are totally convinced that the recognition which is won by sweat and blood is
more likely to endure than that which is granted on a silver platter. Hence their
continued rejection of the solutions based on pragmatism rather than legality. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To freedom-lovers throughout the world, occupied Palestine represents
the last significant outpost of European colonialism. The struggle of its people to
realize their national aspirations has been long, bloody and painful. As they stand at the
crossroads of the twenty-first century, they see in the distance a promising future
enlightened by resistance. Driven by the conviction that their condition will not change
by the stroke of a pen or the passing of a resolution, they have resolved to take the long
and certain road to success instead of the misleading short-cut of &#147;reasonable
compromise&#148;. For it is only through a just solution that the dark consequences of
1948 be finally removed. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">(4-4)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>The Zionist Lobby and the Judaization of Jerusalem</u></b><br>
Judging by the development of U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Israel has had success in
managing its drive to gain U.S. support for Israel&#146;s colonization policies in the
Holy City. Israel was also able to devalue the UN resolutions concerning the legal status
of Jerusalem as an occupied city by the fact that the rapid Judaization going on in
Jerusalem is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and a blatant aggression against the
United Nations and its resolutions.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>This success is more than partially owed to the efforts of the
Jewish community in the United States, with its extensive network of money and media.
Through political action committees (PACs), the Jewish community has been able to collect
millions to elect Congressmen who support Israel. The PACs collected $14 million to
support candidates for the 1994 elections, and the funds raised for the presidential and
Congressional elections of 1996 surpassed that by millions.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Richard Curtiss writes that the pro-Israeli committees are the
single biggest financial contributors during U.S. election seasons compared to all other
interest groups. Curtiss adds that most pro-Israeli PACs were founded by the board members
of AIPAC. This Washington-based group is considered the biggest Israeli lobby.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>The Jewish community is able to mobilize its vote for political
reasons. Jews in the United States usually vote at a rate of 90%, while only 47% of the
U.S. population at large votes. The importance of the Jewish vote is clear during any
election, whether presidential or congressional.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>If we think like presidential and congressional candidates
eyeing the elections of the year 2000, it is obvious that the &#147;Jerusalem agenda&#148;
will be a political bargaining chip. Candidates will use the idea of &#147;Jerusalem is
the capital of Israel&#148; to win the votes of the Jewish community and the support of
the pro-Israeli PACs. Most people believe that Vice President Al Gore, known for his
absolute support of Israel, will follow Clinton in the presidency. If so, the project to
Judaize Jerusalem politically will be accomplished using both the Republican dominated
Congress and possibly another Democratic administration.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Conclusion</u></b><br>
The clearest and most consistent characteristic in Washington&#146;s policies toward Arabs
and Muslims is belittlement and disregard. This administration understands that the way it
is dealing with Arabs and Muslims will not serve its long-term strategic interests in the
region. Clinton addressed the possibility of a backlash in the Arab and Islamic world in
response to the drastic shift in American policy evidenced by the veto of a United Nations
Security Council resolution condemning Israel for its plan to build settlements in East
Jerusalem. Clinton said in a joint press conference on 10 March 1997 with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, &#147;I was very aware of how the veto might make the United
States look in the Arab world. I haven&#146;t vetoed all the resolutions criticizing
Israel&#133; I have abstained in some.&#148;<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>The age-old problem of Arabs and Muslims is that we were and
still are unwilling to take a united stand against Israel&#146;s hostile policies and
America&#146;s hypocrisy. Israel would not be able to act with such callousness were it
not for America&#146;s unconditional support on all levels&#151;political, military and
economic. Francis Louenberg said, &#147;[without] the two billion per year Israel received
in loan guarantees beginning in 1993, in addition to the annual aid, loans, bonds and
charity from the United States totaling 10 billion per year of free money, Israel would be
shown to be bankrupt.&#148; This statement makes it clear that Israel is dependent on U.S.
foreign aid to survive, and American Arabs and Muslims should have something to say about
this money and how it is being spent. It is American taxpayer money.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>What is required of every Christian and Muslim Arab now, more
than at any other time, is for us to reinforce Arab Christian and Muslim solidarity. Arab
and Muslim forces must join in the battle to defend the Muslim, Christian and Arab
character of Jerusalem. We must discourage normalized relations between Israel and the
countries of the Arab and Muslim world. We must maintain resistance to Israeli occupation
and arrogance. There should be a clear message sent to Washington: <i>Your strategic
interests in this region are in jeopardy unless you make a more balanced policy,
acknowledging and showing respect for the interests of the indigenous Arab, Christian and
Muslim peoples of Palestine and the world.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font></i>Arab and Muslim countries, until now it seems, have
submitted to the status quo and are racing to normalize relations with Israel. Such
policies have further belittled and humiliated the Arab States in the eyes of the policy
makers in the West and more importantly in the eyes of our children, our sons and
daughters whose birthrights we have left undefended. There is an ancient Arab saying:
&#147;If you don&#146;t act like a lion, the hyenas will piss on you.&#148; Israel is
playing power politics, with no regard for UN resolutions or international law. During the
1982 aggression against Lebanon, the Israeli Minister of Defense, Ariel Sharon, who was
credited with the massacre of Palestinians in Sabra and Shatilla, said &#147;Heavy shoes
make history, i.e. might makes right. The world does not care about the massacred and
weak.&#148; </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Official U.S. agencies&#151;legislative and executive&#151;are
staffed with many zealous Zionists, and this is allowing Israel to act as though it is a
State above the law. It seems to Arabs and Muslims that we have no recourse but to ask for
Israel&#146;s friendship, yet the reality is that we have strong political leverage of our
own that has gone unexploited, simply because we have lacked the will to use our assets to
our own advantage.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in a state of disunity, which has been fed by greed and
corruption that has cost us the lives of our own people, our own families. Unless we unify
with a clear mission, the only sound Arabs and Muslims will hear in the near or distant
future will be the sound of the U.S. veto on every issue that is of importance to Arab
dignity and independence. The Arabs will wake up in the new millennium to the sounds of
U.S. presidential candidates raising the issue of Jerusalem to a pitch that will silence
the meager voices of those who will cry out for justice and fairness. We must begin today
to resist, to unify and to reclaim our birthright in the Christian, Muslim and Jewish Holy
Land of Jerusalem, the land of the children of Abraham.</p>

</i></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there a real crisis in the relationship between Islam and
Christianity in Palestine warranting investigation? Or is there a misunderstanding between
the followers of the two religions, warranting efforts on our part to clear up the
situation? Or are the different ideas of Islam and Christianity forcing some to believe
that the relationship between them is very tense? Is there a complicated situation that
cannot be unraveled?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many answers that would require dialogue to clear up the
picture. We are not talking about a real problem when we address the relationship between
Islam and Christianity. We are not talking about misunderstandings on both sides that
cannot be reversed. These are normal and occur in all societies. The important question
is: What can the intellectuals do in this situation to prevent adverse results? And what
is the role of education in forming minds that can accept different ideas and opinions?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;When the believer&#151;Muslim or Christian&#151;lives a life of
spirituality and godliness, the differences between people melt away, and life becomes a
manifestation of God&#146;s greatness, a field for his blessings. All creations seem to be
God&#146;s children. But one might turn one&#146;s faith inwards and concentrate on small
technicalities until one sees someone on the other end of the faith spectrum to be a devil
that must be avoided, an enemy that must be fought as a religious obligation. This is how
ideas become convoluted, sometimes moving far <i>away </i>from the open godly spirit of
those who are immersed in the love of God.&#148;<sup><b>1</b></sup></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we talk about Islamic-Christian relations, we must take a moment
to talk about the historic aspects of this relationship in order to clarify the basis of
this relationship and understand the nature of the future relationship that we would like
to see in a civil society in Palestine. Such a future relationship would be built on ideas
that come together to build a strong, unified structure.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot separate Islamic-Christian relations in Palestine from
Islamic-Christian relations in the East in general, although in Palestine there are
certain idiosyncracies because of the situation there. Israeli occupation did not
discriminate between the treatment of both religions, but it did play on the
contradictions in each religion to make problems that sometimes lead to tense and unstable
situations. It would have been worse if not for the intervention of the intellectuals on
both sides who had a feel for what the occupation was trying to do and understood the role
of the occupation agencies. Their interventions led to a state of psychological stability
and cooperation best suited to build a relationship based on respect and appreciation on
both sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When talking about this relationship, one cannot deny that there are
major differences in their conceptions of God, the universe, and life. But these
differences are not the subject of this study. The issue was settled with the verse from
the Qur&#146;an, &#147;Let there be no compulsion in religion: truth stands out clear from
error.&#148;<sup><b>2</b> </sup>The relationship has been tainted with tension and
misunderstanding at times. This is due to misconceptions of people on both sides who do
not have sufficient knowledge of religion or of the relationship among Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we lay the foundations for a future relationship between Islam and
Christendom in Palestine, we cannot ignore the political and social differences between
the two sides. But we can try to bring the points of view closer in order to build the
relationship on a sense of mutual respect and to give a chance for differing opinions to
be aired. This society must make room for all ideas as long as they are healthy and follow
in the tradition of our Arab and Islamic heritage. To begin discussing specific ideas, we
must go beyond generalities by making two points: the first concerns the historic
dimension of this relationship in terms of Omar&#146;s Covenant, and the second concerns
the rules governing the relationship between Islam and Christianity.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>The Historic Dimension</u></b><br>
Omar&#146;s Covenant is the basis for defining the relationship between Islam and
Christianity in Palestine. It is the document that, in all clarity and respect, laid the
foundations not only for the era of Islamic expansion, but also for the centuries after
that and for the future. Anyone who studies this document finds that it contains fixed
principles that apply to all places and times. In order to understand it fully, one must
read the following text carefully:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is the
    security that the servant of God, Omar, Emir of the Faithful, gives the people of Elia
    (the Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem). He gives them security for their persons and
    their properties, for their churches and crosses, for their sick and innocent, and for all
    their followers. Their churches will not be taken over or destroyed. Nothing is taken from
    them that belongs to them, neither their crosses nor any of their money. They are not
    forced to change their religion, and none of them shall be harmed. No Jew shall live with
    them in Elia (no Jew had the right to settle on Christian land. Omar later changed this
    and Jews were invited by Omar to settle in Jerusalem). The people of Elia must pay the tax
    at the same rate as other cities. They must drive the Romans and thieves out. Those who
    leave, as well as their money, are safe until they reach their safe havens. Whoever stays
    is safe, and must pay the tax at the same rate as the people of Elia. Whoever among the
    people of Elia wants to leave with his money and join the Romans and leave their business
    and crosses is safe until they reach their safe haven. Whoever is from the people of this
    land can stay, and must pay the tax at the same rate as the people of Elia. Whoever wants
    to leave with the Romans can leave, and whoever wants to return to his family can do so.
    Nothing from their harvests shall be taken. This writing has the oath of God, His Prophet,
    the Caliphs, and the faithful as long as they pay their taxes.<sup><b>3</em></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should start with this historic treatise because I see the
relationship between the two parties as based on respect and security, which in turn would
lay the foundation for the society that we want. Any other behaviour would be a deviation
from this foundation and would violate the true understanding of the relationship. The
main points we discern from the covenant are the following. There will be:</p>

<p>- Personal and financial security;<br>
- Freedom of religion in belief and worship;<br>
- The right to be protected and for the State to come to one&#146;s defense to make sure
onecomes to no harm;<br>
-&nbsp; Freedom of movement when and wherever one wants.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omar&#146;s Covenant, which is a reference text when it comes to
relations between Islam and Christianity, shows how positively the first Muslims saw the
relationship between themselves and those of other religions. What Sir Thomas Arnold wrote
in his valuable book, <i>Calling to Islam, </i>in the chapter on Christians under Islamic
rule, is truly beautiful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>When the Christians lived in security for their lives and
    properties, reveling in such tolerance which granted them freedom of religious thought,
    they enjoyed a life of luxury in the early days of the Islamic Caliphate. Mu&#146;awiya
    (A.D. 661-681, A.H. 41-60) was able to employ Christians as civil servants, as did others
    from the Umayyad house of Malik. Christians held high places in the Caliphs&#146; court.
    There was Al-Aftal, an Arab Christian who was the royal court&#146;s poet, and Abu
    al-Qadees, a.k.a. St. John of Damascus, the adviser of Caliph Abdul Malik.<sup><b>4</em></p>
    </b></sup>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the basic view of the relationship in a Muslim society. Any
other situations are a deviation from the old path. By this simple introduction, I want
the reader to understand how I see the basis of the relationship between Islam and
Christianity not only in Palestine, and not only in the Arab world, but everywhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the basis for human relations in all societies: if they are not
built on balance and respect, they become weak. &#147;The Lord&#146;s justice manifests
itself on the social level in calling for a humanistic, open society that has all faiths
and opinions, or as Sayyid Qutub says, &#145;Where there is no force.&#146; ... This must
be a basic element of its being....It must not choke them, drive them from their homes, or
bury them in the snows of Siberia. It must not assassinate them with cleansing movements.
This is because it depends on faith and on every individual&#146;s voluntary defense of
the order.&#148;<sup><b>5</b></sup></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Any regime that does not allow dissenters to live in peace and
security holds the seeds of its own downfall, even if it owns all the technologies of
oppression. These techniques and technologies will protect it for a short while, but it
will explode from the inside. Those of other religions who refuse to live under Islam will
not be the enemies of Islam unless they begin aggression. So the relationship between
Islam and Christians in society must be based on justice and charity, because it is a
society based on a free contract calling for justice and equality in rights and
obligations. Participation is based on merit and trustworthiness. Citizenry is based on
equality.&#148;<sup><b>6</b></sup></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;The healthy society is that which is able to absorb others in it,
where all are working to build a better life. [The society I&#146;m looking for is one
where] the relationship between citizens is based on justice, mercy and piety, not one
where xenophobia, selfishness, and close-mindedness rule, and the differences between
religion, gender, and color govern.&#148;<sup><b>7</b></sup></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reader might think that this study will be limited to generalities
and nice words that confront the issue of Islamic-Christian relations superficially,
without looking to the desired future relationship. But clarifying the basis of the
relationship might do away with many of the conflicts that come up in daily transactions
between the two groups. It might also do away with the current
argument&#151;well-intentioned or not&#151;about the status of non-Muslims in Islamic
societies. The fear of some that the ideology-driven situation of Christians in an Islamic
society must be harsh is unjustified if we look at the relationship that we have just
described.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The history of Muslim-Christian relations in Palestine is enough to
guarantee the construction of a strong relationship based on mutual respect and clear
understanding that everyone has full rights as members of a society that all are trying to
build.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></i><font color="#FF0000">Kosovo, the Roots of Conflict</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Azzam Tamimi* </b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without the need to strike any comparisons, the tragedy of Kosovo may
go down in history as one of the most horrific in modern times. There have been numerous
European tragedies this century; few, including that of Kosovo, are so dramatic as to have
a significant impact on the future not only of Europe but also of the entire world.
Experts pointed out right from the beginning that the issue of Kosovo is likely to be the
most intractable of all the political conflicts in the Balkans. If war were to break out,
it was predicted, the killing and destruction would be more intense than anything hitherto
witnessed in the region. There may be little disagreement on this conclusion, though
people may continue to disagree on the nature of the conflict that has led to this
particular tragedy. The most obvious feature of the conflict in Kosovo may easily be said
to be ethnic or religious. Some may contend that a Serb/Albanian or Christian
Orthodox/Islamic divide can clearly be seen. Numerous arguments may be put forward to
prove the point that ethno-religious tensions are to blame. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The popular view of the recent wars in Croatia and Bosnia was always
that these were ethnic conflicts. Particularly in the case of Kosovo, it would seem that
what we are dealing with is indeed a genuine ethnic conflict. The basic division is, in
the first place, an ethnic one in the full sense. Unlike the different types of Bosnians,
who are all Slavs and all speak the same language, the Serbs and the Albanians are
linguistically quite separate. Together with the differences in language goes a range of
other cultural differences, many of them linked to religion&#151;the division between Serb
and Albanian roughly coincides with the division between Eastern Orthodox and Muslim. (The
exceptions are the small minority of Catholic Albanians and the Muslim Slavs, who more or
less identify with the Bosnians or Bosnian Muslims.) With both language and religion
setting people apart, all the conditions seem to be present for a primary conflict of
peoples <font SIZE="1"><b>(1).</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Albanians of Kosovo today are in many ways a politically mobilized
people, but religion has played almost no role at all in that mobilization. There is no
Islamic political movement among the Albanians. Where religion is a factor in the present
political situation is on the Orthodox side, which constantly employs religious rhetoric
to justify the defence of &#145;sacred&#146; Serbian interests. But this, according to
Malcolm, is a classic example of religion being mobilized and manipulated for ideological
purposes <font SIZE="1"><b>(2).</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The roots of today&#146;s conflict are traced to the nineteenth-century
Serbian ideology, which created a cult of the medieval battle of Kosovo, as some sort of
nationally-defining historical and spiritual event. This may well be related to the rapid
transformations that took place in Europe at the time, including the rise of nationalism.
The mass-expulsion of Albanians and other Muslims from the areas conquered by Serbia and
Montenegro during the period 1877-1878 played a part in persuading the Albanians in Kosovo
that Serbia&#151;and the Serbs of Kosovo who were claimed as an unredeemed part of the
Serbian population&#151;represented a threat to their existence. The Albanians perceived
the Serbian-Montenegro rule (and its re-imposition as Yugoslav rule in 1918) as a foreign
colonial rule similar to that imposed on many other peoples conquered and colonized by
European Christian powers. Just as the French did in Algeria and the Russians in
Chechenia, the Serbs embarked on an explicit programme of introducing Serb colonists to
Kosovo throughout the inter-war period. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A memorandum sent to the Great Powers by Belgrade in early 1913 set out
three justifications for Serbian rule in Kosovo: the moral right of a more civilized
people; the historic right to an area which contained the patriarchate buildings of the
Serbian Orthodox Church and had once been part of the medieval Serbian empire; and a kind
of ethnographic right based on the fact that at some time in the past Kosovo had had a
majority Serb population&#151;a right which, according to the memorandum, was unaffected
by the recent invasion of Albanians <font SIZE="1"><b>(3).</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In emulation of Jewish nationalism as expressed by Zionism, the Serb
nationalists claim that Kosovo is the &#145;Jerusalem&#146; of the Serbs. This claim is
belied by the fact that in no form of Christianity, including Eastern Orthodoxy, does a
&#145;holy place&#146; play any sort of theological role equivalent to the role of
Jerusalem in the theology of Judaism. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been suggested that the contemporary crisis is primarily the
making of one single actor, Slobodan Milosevic, who is neither a Serb nor an observant
Orthodox. The clues to the present Kosovar riddle should probably be sought in the history
and personality of this dictator. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Milosevic came to real power in Belgrade in 1987. Until then he had
been an unknown Communist who ascended the ladder of power within the Party thanks to the
influence of his wife. He might not have made it had it not been for the card of Serb
nationalism he played at a time when the communist world seemed to crumble rapidly. Soon
after becoming president of Serbia, Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its autonomy. Like the
Pharaoh of Egypt, Hitler of Germany and many dictators of modern as well as ancient times,
paranoia and greed determined Milosevic&#146;s attitude and the destiny of the nation he
had imposed himself upon. Like all such despots, Milosevic needed a source of
legitimization for his criminal acts. Nationalism and religion have been, as in most other
cases, the most convenient tools.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NATO Action versus Muslim Inaction</b></u><br>
The sweeping sentiment of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world has driven many Muslim
commentators, and most expectedly a large segment of the Muslim public, to suspect the
motives of the American-led NATO operation against Serbia. Some Arab governments, notably
Iraq, Libya and Algeria, have publicly voiced objection to the NATO campaign and expressed
full solidarity with the Serbs. Just until before the campaign started, many writers in
the Arab and Muslim press condemned the West for its failure to act in spite of repeated
threats to punish the Serbs for refusing to sign the deal reached over Kosovo. Had the
victims been non-Muslims, it was lamented, the West would have immediately interfered.
After the campaign started, the NATO operation was blamed, this time not only by Muslim
commentators but also by many in the West, for causing the massive exodus of Kosovars into
neighbouring countries. The Serb systematic displacement of Kosovars and the savage
destruction and looting of their homes seemed to suggest that it was NATO to blame. Had
the bombardment not started, it was suggested, the Serbs might not have resorted to such
barbarity. In spite of the fact that the Serbian &#145;ethnic cleansing&#146; of the
Kosovars had already started long before NATO acted, the enormity of the exodus and
suffering has led some to question the motives, strategy and objectives of the NATO
alliance. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NATO action is motivated by a number of considerations. Although
humanitarian considerations are included, they are definitely not the primary ones. Policy
makers in the West are human beings; they do feel for others, but usually it is interests
rather than passions that dictate policy. Humanitarian considerations, especially when
coinciding with an overwhelming public sentiment, may facilitate the adoption of a certain
action that under different circumstances may prove rather difficult to take. It is
definitely not easy for the West to bomb a European country in the manner we have been
witnessing every day for the past three weeks. But the actions of Slobodan Milosevic have
made the task a lot easier than first predicted. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This dictator has proven to be a real threat to stability, and thus to
U.S. interests, in Europe. His ultra-nationalist inclinations, especially with regard to
his plans in Kosovo, could have embroiled the entire European continent in endless
regional conflicts. Albania, Greece, Turkey and Italy could have been drawn into the
conflict if Milosevic were not checked or stopped. The prospects of augmenting the tension
between Greece and Turkey, both being NATO members, loomed in the air and might have
played an important part in encouraging NATO to act. Furthermore, the growing sympathy for
the displaced, murdered and raped Kosovars across the Western hemisphere, and the burden
such a drastic demographic imbalance may place on involuntary host countries in the
region, prepared the scene for a major operation. But will the air strikes alone do the
job? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite repeated official proclamations that no ground invasion is
intended, military and political analysts have agreed, especially since the beginning of
the second week of bombardment, that the battle will not be resolved without a ground
invasion of Kosovo. It is now expected that sooner or later NATO will have to send in its
troops. For Milosevic has proven his readiness to have his entire country&#146;s
infrastructure destroyed as a price for exhausting NATO. He would be hoping that this will
cause a shift in public opinion in his favour. This is unlikely to happen any time in the
near future because of the human catastrophe Milosevic has effected&#151;a catastrophe
that press headlines and TV screens tire not from reminding us all on a daily basis. In
the meantime, and in spite of the fact that most of the victims of Milosevic are Muslims,
Islamic reaction is rather meagre. At the governmental level, it is possible that
inability to act has been combined with the satisfaction, especially in pro-U.S.
countries, that America is doing what is necessary. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in talking about willingness to act, because what
matters here is not the will to act but the ability to do so. Action is something Arab and
Islamic countries have no access to. At the popular level, there is a sense of profound
despair combined with enormous sympathy and confusion as to the motives and objectives of
the NATO operation. The experience of many Arab Afghan war veterans who joined the war in
Bosnia and relief work in Albania and Bosnia since the early 1990s has not encouraged any
more Arabs or Muslims to get involved, let alone being able to get involved. It was the
United States, in cooperation and coordination with Arab regimes, that arranged for all
such volunteers to be expelled or extradited and handed over to the security agencies in
their own countries. Arabs and Muslims have this time been content with voicing sympathy
and urging NATO to arm the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) so as to defend their homes and
people. NATO may not want to do this, but if it were to limit its own ground involvement,
it might have no other option but to prepare the KLA for the task. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kosovars are not short of men and may, if well-trained and equipped,
bring defeat upon Milosevic and his pirates.</p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Ray Hanania*</i></b><font FACE="Arial"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it comes to justice, most Americans are more motivated by their
emotions than they are by what is right.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just take the example of the decision by the Government of Libya to
accept a U.S.-sponsored plan to try two suspects for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103, which exploded over Lockerbie Scotland killing 270 people, including 189 Americans.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue isn&#146;t the trial, although Libya has fought now-abandoned
demands that the suspects be turned over to a U.S. or British court for trial. The two
Libyans&#151;innocent until proven guilty (right!)&#151;will be tried in the Netherlands,
a neutral country.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the bombing, the United States imposed a worldwide embargo
against Libya that is being temporarily lifted by the United Nations but that remains in
effect for the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It all seems like justice, doesn&#146;t it? Accept that it is not.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United States, for example, doesn&#146;t believe in justice when
its citizens are involved in the murder of Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five months before Pan Am Flight 103 crashed in a fiery explosion,
gunmen on the USS Vincennes, ostensibly patrolling international waters off the coast of
Iran, fired upon Iranian Airbus A300, destroying the commercial civilian aircraft and
killing all 290 people on board.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a civilian aircraft, like the Pan Am flight. Twenty more people
were killed than in the Lockerbie explosion. But, in this case, we know exactly who pulled
the trigger. The Captain of the Cruiser, Will C. Rogers III. He is better known as
&#147;Buck Rogers&#148; for his tendency to shoot first and offer lame excuses later.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rogers, the ship&#146;s commander, asserted that his crew
&#147;mistook&#148; the giant commercial Boeing 747 plane filled with Iranian Muslims for
a much smaller, military F-14 fighter jet. They shot it down. Everyone died.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A hastily arranged investigation by the United States blamed one
&#147;operations officer&#148;, and issued the lowest possible punishment: <u>a letter of
reprimand placed in the unknown officer&#146;s personnel file.</u> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Imagine if Libyan President Moammar Khadafy issued a letter of
reprimand for the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing how insane Americans would become.
(Blood lust has an insatiable and uncontrollable way of distorting facts.)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Behind the scenes, U.S. officials passed on rumours that the Airbus had
been pre-loaded with dead bodies, and intentionally sent to the war zone believing it
would be shot down to create a situation to rebuke the Americans. (This was repeated often
by family members of the victims on national TV.)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For more than four years, U.S. officials insisted the Airbus was at
fault and had veered out of Iranian airspace into international waters, and thereby
justified the attack. Finally, in 1992, evidence surfaced that, in fact, the commercial
Iranian airline had been on course and was in Iranian airspace. It was the USS Vincennes
that had been off course by more than 20 miles.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional evidence showed that the commander of the American cruiser,
Rogers, may have intentionally shot the commercial airline down, and that he was egging
for such a military hit. The Vincennes had been called into the waters near Iran as a
result of the Iran-Iraq war, and they claimed tiny little Iranian gunboats had fired upon
the massive U.S. cruiser.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all the bluster from then-President Ronald Reagan, he never once
expressed remorse for the murder of the 290 Muslim civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United States has never publicly apologized for the downing of the
commercial plane and have resisted all efforts by the Iranians to investigate Captain
Rogers and his crew.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the United States was quick to offer monetary compensation to
the families of the 290 victims. More than $131 million was paid to sweep the controversy
under the rug.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iranian protests to the United Nations were muted by allies of the
United States government.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No UN embargo was imposed on the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No full-page advertisements were purchased calling for the extradition
of that American buckaroo, Will C. Rogers. All evidence suggests he knew it was a
commercial Iranian airline, but wanted to bring it down anyway.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The families of the victims of Airbus A300 did not form a special
organization to hire lawyers to exact a punishment from the Americans. They weren&#146;t
given a forum on national American TV, as were family members of the Pan Am 103 disaster.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And, no court martial was held to indict Will C. Rogers for a crime
that he and the U.S. Navy struggled to cover up these past 10 years.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe the victims of Pan Am 103 downed off of Lockerbie, Scotland, do
deserve justice.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But do they deserve any more justice than the victims of Iranian Airbus
A300?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More American hypocrisy makes it difficult to feel real compassion for
the relatives of those who died over Lockerbie. But then again, they don&#146;t seem to
care and they openly admit they believe the Lockerbie bombing was in retaliation for the
Iranian Airbus downing.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let&#146;s see how much of that surfaces in the kangaroo court that is
planned in the Netherlands.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">How To Promote Civilizational Dialogue: <br>
Some Policy Guidelines For The West And The Muslims</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ronald E. Neumann*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite clear statements since 1992, we are often asked: &#147;What is
your policy toward Islam?&#148; Our clear choice is not to have such a single policy
toward Islam because the perceived need for such a policy is wrong on facts and contrary
to our values. We reject, and have rejected, the &#147;clash of civilizations&#148; thesis
as a basis of policy. We do have policies toward States, against terrorism and violence,
and in support of democracy. I would like to talk about these elements.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To accept the idea that the West is one broad, unified political
construct and Islam is another would make it practically incumbent on the United States to
have a policy toward Islam, as we do toward other large political constructs called
nation-States or regional groupings. We do not accept that idea.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me be clear and emphatic: the United States of America does not and
should not have a political policy toward Islam. Islam is first and foremost a
religion&#151;as with other great religions, it offers a prescription for an
individual&#146;s relationship with God and for the relationship among human beings
themselves. The ways in which individuals, groups, or States work out the prescription
lead to a wide variety of political actions which are a proper focus of policy, but which
are not unified at all.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United States of America does not have a policy directed at any of
the world&#146;s religions. We do not have a policy on Islam because, as Assistant
Secretary Djerejian said in his 1992 Meridian House speech, with reference to political
Islamist movements, &#147;We detect no monolithic or coordinated international effort
behind these movements.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What I want to express clearly is that we do not see Islam as something
intrinsically foreign, for which we need a foreign policy. It is a simple fact that there
are millions of Muslims in the United States today and Islam is the fastest growing
religion in the United States. It is one of the world&#146;s great religions and a force
of civilization. Recognizing that Islam is as American as any other religion practiced by
our people, I need only point to the First Lady&#146;s participation in the Eid al-Fitr
activities at the White House this year and the President&#146;s greetings to the American
Muslim community on that occasion.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a religion, Islam advocates many of the same values so many
Americans hold dear: the centrality of religion to a well-lived life, high regard for the
importance of family, and, in the form closest to the practice and sayings of the Prophet,
toleration and respect for the beliefs of others. So, I repeat that the foreign policy
issue is not Islam, but political actions in particular places by particular people.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A now famous theory argues that Islam, mostly outside the United
States, is part of a large clash of civilizations.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of a clash of civilizations has become a catch-all phrase
thrown blithely about by people, only some of whom have actually read the articles and the
book from which it comes. I do not really mean to caricature Professor Huntington&#146;s
work, but unfortunately it came along just as people were looking for a framework to
analyze the post-Cold War turmoil they were seeing in the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Huntington&#146;s work has been used by some to interpret the violence
and turmoil that we were seeing in parts of the Arab world, although the Islamic world as
a whole is much larger. This violence seemed to be peculiarly foreign and particularly
frightening. In short, Huntington&#146;s theories gave intellectual credibility to
half-formed perceptions and feelings that many people already had about Islam and the
possibility, if not inevitability, of a clash with the West.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a concept we have steadfastly rejected. Former National
Security Advisor Anthony Lake was quite clear on this point in a 1994 speech to the
Washington Institute. Referring directly to the clash of civilizations, he said, &#147;We
strongly disagree.&#133;There is indeed a fundamental divide. But the fault line runs not
between &#145;civilizations&#146; or religions....No, it runs instead between oppression
and responsible government, between isolation and openness, and between moderation and
extremism. And it knows no distribution by race or creed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, I submit that the idea of policy based on what people
believe and think is fundamentally antithetical to basic American principles. Our history
and laws have built an important division between, on the one hand, nearly absolute
freedom to advance ideas and, on the other, sometimes quite stringent restrictions on the
means that are legitimate to implement those ideas. We do not make policy on the basis of
others&#146; thought because to do so could be destructive to the ideas and values we hold
dear.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, having spoken so much about what we do not have and do not accept
in terms of policy, let me now speak more positively.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Islam becomes a foreign policy issue only because some people and
countries exploit and abuse its rhetoric, ideas and symbols for actions that we do oppose.
Islam, as a religion, does not prescribe any particular international policy, but some
States and some groups within States have chosen to use their own interpretation of the
religion as a justification for policy and practices of oppression and terrorism. It is
these policies and practices that interest us, not their alleged religious justification.
If these same policies and practices were justified by some other means, the will of the
leader and his social theories, for example, or just on a more mundane assessment of
national interest, our response would be the same.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the justification, we will always oppose those who:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Practice terrorism, oppress minorities, preach intolerance or
violate internationally accepted norms of human rights, including the right to freedom of
conscience or religion;<br>
2. Oppose the peaceful resolution of disputes, especially that between Arabs and Israelis;<br>
3. Use repression, violence, or terrorism to pursue their objectives.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In contrast, we support those who work toward political pluralism. By
laying down these redlines, to use a word popular in the region, we are not talking about
imposing a precise American model on anybody&#146;s political system or foreign policy.
Instead, we believe that certain values are universal, such as political participation and
adherence to internationally accepted human rights norms. These values do not belong just
to the United States, although we like to believe that we are a leading proponent. They
belong to all of humanity. I would point out that many societies or political groupings
that call themselves Islamic, and therefore lay claim to being just, accept that these
values are as much a part of their cultural and political heritage as they are of ours.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that many of the young people who find their way into
Islamist groups, and sometimes into extremism, do so because they see no other way to make
a real difference in their own societies and political systems. There is a widespread
sense of failure now attached to the political theories of the period of struggle for
independence and the early post-independence period. More openness and political
participation, along with globally oriented economic policies, would greatly reduce the
appeal of extremism of whatever religious or ideological coloration. It is also
unfortunate that, while some Muslim States are taking steps toward democracy, many Muslim
States of the Middle East have slipped behind other regions of the world, both in terms of
increasing political participation and participating in the best aspects of economic and
informational globalization and development. This has heightened tensions but the
phenomenon is global.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some thinkers have also suggested that there is an inherent conflict
between Islam and democracy. In that sentence, I may have oversimplified an argument for
the sake of knocking it down, but the idea is essentially simplistic and deserves attack.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Islam, first of all, is not a monolith, even within the four schools of
Sunni Islam and the variation with Shiite practice. Equally, perhaps even more important,
while the Qur&#146;an is eternal, its interpretation does evolve. We in government and in
think-tanks must not treat Islam as static, any more than Christianity. Human
interpretations of religious precepts change. They are changing today across the Muslim
world. From independent Iranian thinkers, who are often silenced but continue to work and
insist on their right to tell the truth as they see it, through struggles in Egypt to
Algerian religious leaders whose supporters have paid in their blood the price of opposing
violence, there are arguments for the harmonization of democratic and Islamic principles.
For example, some thinkers earlier in this century were opposed to parliamentary democracy
as a system incompatible with traditional consensus building in the Islamic community.
That view is increasingly challenged today.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate over interpretation and the application of democracy is a
huge debate, swirling throughout the Islamic world. Ideas of democracy are still
contested. We cannot anticipate the debate&#146;s conclusion. We should study it far more.
But, at a minimum, we must not trivialize it into a few catch phrases, or profess to fully
understand the process, while still in the middle of it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One good example of the dynamism of Islam is the situation in Iran, in
which some religious-political authorities are saying loud and clear that participation
and rule of law are not only compatible with, but also intrinsic parts of, Islamic law and
practice. It is important that we understand that this is not a repudiation of Islam but a
critically important debate within the religion. So, while there is in the minds and
hearts of the faithful, a belief that there is only one Islam, it is clear that there is a
wide and changing variety of the practices associated with it. Many of these ideas are
fully compatible with the values of the United States and internationally recognized
principles. To put it simply, it is possible to be both a devout Muslim and a small
&#147;d&#148; democrat, as long as one believes and acts as if this is so. It is precisely
the actions of people and States to which we must respond and which we seek to influence,
not their intellectual, emotional, or spiritual justifications. The justifications are
ultimately none of our business, however, the actions must be.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The change in views of democracy are occurring in the Middle East. In
Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait and Yemen, there is movement toward more
democratic expression and more influence on policy of elected representatives. Nowhere is
the outcome clear. Nowhere do the lines of controversy put Islamists on only one side of
the debate. Yet if the results are uncertain, there is far too much going on to ignore.
And we are not ignoring it. It is a fact that we are struggling to find the right balance
in support for our diverse interests. But it is also a fact that we are putting in place
new programmes to support democratic development, progress toward the rule of law, and the
emergence of still fragile civic societies. We must do this to be true to our principles
and to build a more stable world in which are own interests can thrive.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to conclude with the views of President Clinton, who has
probably done more to reach out to the Islamic world than any previous president. He told
the Jordanian Parliament in 1994 that there is no clash of civilizations. But there are
contests between forces that transcend civilization&#151;a contest between freedom and
tyranny, terror and security, bigotry and tolerance, and isolation and openness. We have
chosen our side. Our task is to bring all the peoples of the region of whatever faith into
the &#147;camp of peace&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">By: Erik Paul</font><font SIZE="5"></p>
</font></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Americans should not actually be as shocked as
they were when incidents such as the most violent school shooting ever on April 20, in a
suburb of Denver, Colorado take place. While NATO forces are bombing Yugoslavia to
oblivion, Americans back home are in the ongoing ceaseless process of slaughtering each
other. But then, what can one expect from children brought up in a permissive society, one
that encourages violence, immoral behavior and on top of all this, a growing &#147;Gun
Culture?&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Not only are American children saturated with
violence on TV and inundated with it by computer and video games, they witness through the
media, the ruthless, cruel and merciless air attacks that are now common in the NATO air
war against the Yugoslav people. Let us not forget Iraq (yet another example of genocide)
that still suffers from harsh UN sanctions and almost daily bombings by U.S. warplanes.
America, more than any other country, is responsible for atrocities against humanity. It
either supports countries such as Israel who continue their persecution, killings, and
bombings of civilian populations or it itself participates in such nefarious deeds, and in
fact, is the leader of aggressive attacks at various strategic locations around the world.
</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">When youth are constantly exposed to such grave
and colossal acts of mass violence against the helpless and innocent, death must indeed
seem trivial and superficial. American people have become immune to blood and violence and
there is often confusion among some of the already bewildered between what is real and
what is virtual. Hence, repeated mass killings such as the latest incident committed by
fellow students at a local high school in Colorado will continue to happen. Americans
anyway are prone to &#147;copy cat&#148; crimes. More violent and brutal killings will in
turn beget apprentices eager to not only imitate a violent crime, but surpass that crime
in ugliness and bloodshed. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Another factor that contributes to vicious acts
of violence stems from the kind of society that pampers criminals and killers and punishes
their victims. Since there is no religion to deter the whims of a godless people, then
there is no sin, no set of values; therefore, anything horrible, tragic, and immoral can
be expected to happen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">It is a sad absurdity, even a mockery that U.S.
President Bill Clinton stated in a speech the day following the high school killings that
Americans must hammer home to &#147;...all children of America that violence is
wrong.&#148; He also urged his fellow countrymen to learn &#147;how to solve our problems
peacefully.&#148; How can children be taught that violence is wrong and that they must
learn to solve their problems peacefully when NATO planes so savagely bomb civilians all
over Yugoslavia, whether in Kosovo or Belgrade itself? Bombs are the highest form of
violence and as for solving problems peacefully, why didn&#146;t Mr. Monica use such a
tactic in Yugoslavia in the first place? There has never been such an immoral American
president to lead such an immoral American people. Clinton can hardly be called a role
model for American youth, certainly neither on the basis of his own personal affairs, nor
on the basis of his international dealings.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">At the sight of the Columbine High School
slayings and in the homes of the killers, over 30 explosive devices were found. Other
weapons used included a sawed-off shotgun and a semi-automatic handgun. How do children
have access to such weapons and how do they know how to construct such explosives as pipe
bombs? Americans buy around 12 million guns every year. Children get a hold of weapons by
stealing, from friends and associates, or buy them from adults and they can even learn how
to make bombs through the Internet.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Though the killers were fellow students, they
called themselves &#147;The Trenchcoat Mafia&#148; and labeled themselves outcasts. But
they lived in comfortable Middle Class neighborhoods and the incident occurred in a
&#147;sleepy&#148; suburb of Denver. These two killers were angry children who acted out
their anger rather than tried to search for and solve whatever problems they may have had.
America has one of the most affluent and technically advanced societies in the world, yet,
this society, inspite of all its material comforts, is deeply disturbed and unhappy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">God will never overlook nor forget injustice. And
injustice meted out to one party will ultimately backfire. America has committed so many
injustices that its path to any kind of future at all is extremely precarious and loaded
with booby traps and time bombs. Their pipe dreams are fueled by pipe bombs.</font><font COLOR="#000080"></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></b></font><font color="#FF0000">The Killing Machine Versus The Mask Of
Evil</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font color="#000000">By Ruth Anderson</font></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">After more than a month of vicious Air Strikes,
it is not really heartwarming nor reassuring that NATO forces are so nobly defending the
&#147;ethnic Albanians&#148; from the Serbs. And it should be disregarded that
&#147;ethnic cleansing&#148; takes place in other corners of the world with the blessing
of the American government. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">As an example, let us take Israel. Ethnic
cleansing has been going on in Palestine for more than 50 years. Such cleansing all began
prior to World War ll and during the 1948 war, a million Palestinians were expelled from
their homeland in order to make way for European Jews. Where was America then? Where was
Britain? During the 1967 War when Israel occupied the West Bank, more ethnic cleansing
took place and Palestinians either remained to be killed or fled their homes, just as the
Kosovars are now doing, to become refugees. Where were NATO forces then? </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">In 1948 why didn&#146;t American President Harry
Truman and British Prime Minister Clement Attlee (the main abettors to the crime) demand
that these European invading Jews withdraw from the land that they had no legal, moral, or
religious right to; and if those demands were not met, then send in forces to make sure
they were? What about the millions of Palestinians now in Diaspora? When will they be
allowed to return to their homes? And how about those Jewish settlers who confiscate
Palestinians homes and land so they can build new and more settlements? </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">And if we want to talk about justice, why do
6,000 to 7,000 Iraqi babies die each month due to UN sanctions? And why do American planes
continually bomb Iraq? What about the Kurds too? Why are they dispersed and why is there
no justice for them?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Arabs and Muslims should be suspicious of the
NATO air war in Yugoslavia. There may have been many problems between Serbs and the
Kosovars, but at least it is obvious that before the NATO strikes, there were not hundreds
of thousands of refugees fleeing their homes. And how ever much dissension there had been,
it was never on the same scale as it is now. What did the Americans expect the Serbs to do
when they were being bombed, rush right over and hug the Kosovars at a time they must have
held them largely accountable for the bombing? It should have been expected that they
would react violently against the Kosovars once the bombing began. And who can tell if
some of the atrocities committed against the Kosovars wasn&#146;t at the hands of paid
mercenaries with the sole purpose of ridding Kosovo of its Muslim population. And who can
tell if the atrocities committed against the Muslim Kosovars is really not what NATO
wanted all along? Since when were American and NATO countries ever concerned about Muslims
anyway?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Or is it merely the old British colonial military
tactic of &#147;Divide and Conquer?&#148; America and Europe do not really want a Muslim
enclave in the heart of Europe at any rate, and what better way to root out such an
enclave than to pretend to be defending it? If NATO forces really wanted to protect the
Kosovars, then why weren&#146;t ground forces sent to Kosovo in the first place? After
hundreds of thousands of Kosovars fled their homes, who are the NATO forces protecting
anyway?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Well, the bombing of Yugoslavia is a good way of
testing the latest weapons. Also, Russia&#146;s patience and readiness to deploy their own
forces in defense of Yugoslavia is being tested. That a whole country is being destroyed
and that NATO and more specifically America are responsible for the deaths of thousands of
civilians isn&#146;t really important. And it&#146;s not really important that by such
bombing, more hate than ever has been created among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was signed
on April 4, 1949 by Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the U.S. Greece and Turkey were
admitted in 1952 and at present, member nations number 19. The purpose of the treaty was
to enhance the stability, well-being and freedom of its members. Article 1 of the treaty
calls &#147;for peaceful resolutions of disputes.&#148; This past April 4, 1999 marked 50
years of NATO. But what did the member nations really have to celebrate?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">War begins in the minds of men and it is here
that peace must also begin. The killing machine is not just Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and his armed gang, but the American-led NATO forces and the mask of evil could
just as well fit on those responsible for the NATO bombings as they can on Milosevic and
company. There cannot be one code of justice in one part of the world and another code in
another part. What is just is just and what is evil is evil. It is just as wrong for
Israelis to kill Palestinians as it is for Serbs to kill Kosovars. It is just as wrong to
allow 6-7 thousand Iraqi babies die each month as it is to allow &#147;ethnic
cleansing&#148; to take place anywhere on this earth. Silver bullets should be directed to
leaders who are responsible for atrocities and manifest human tragedies should not be
allowed to go on happening. The Lone Ranger should have at the top of his hit list, the
infamous Clinton and his new White House Intern Blair.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Ramzy Baroud</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From a distance, you would not think for a moment that this sleeping
beauty is a city under siege. And why should you? Its giant bridges, ancient ruins and
ever-flowing rivers are a sign of a well-nurtured civilization. Once you get close to its
alleyways, streets and hospitals, however, you will be shocked to see a very different
reality. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is Baghdad, the age-old city, still standing on the banks of its
great rivers&#151;the Tigris and the Euphrates.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the moon caressed the gently-flowing waters of the Tigris giving
one the impression of a mother putting her baby to sleep, my bus was loudly violating the
quietness of the night. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In no time, the rising sun was knocking at my hotel&#146;s window. I
was ready for my first day in Baghdad.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The friendly faces of the Iraqi workers in the hotel greeted me. Within
a few hours, Baghdad looked so familiar, even though this was my first visit. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a few days after the great Muslim Feast (Eid al-Adha). The
spirit of the Feast was still lingering around. But another spirit was also present; the
spirit of those fighters who were determined to survive.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iraq now is a very poor country. Strangely enough, Iraq has all the
means to be ranked as a prosperous and wealthy place. Yet, the U.S./UN sanctions left Iraq
with very little means to even feed its own population. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many have assumed that the &#145;Oil-for-Food&#146; programme, which
was initiated by the United Nations, provides Iraqi families with enough food to survive.
Clearly the programme is failing to do that. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The head of the Red Cross operations in Iraq stated, &#147;People
falsely think that the UN &#145;Oil-for-Food&#146; programme is enough to meet the needs
of the Iraqi people. That is not the case. The programme was intended to supplement the
needs of the Iraqis.&#148; He added, &#147;The rations that the programme provides are not
enough. The rations are hardly given fully, and for logistical reasons, the southern areas
in Iraq don&#146;t usually get their fair share.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we asked the head of UNICEF, Anupama Rao Singh, about
&#145;Oil-for-Food&#146;, her reply was &#147;$5.2 billion are supposed to find their way
to the people of Iraq. Unfortunately, only $3.3 billion get there. A third of this amount
gets used for technicalities, to pay for the operation expenses. In conclusion, two-thirds
of the $3.3 billion are spent on humanitarian missions and that is not enough.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet, many more problems and statistics pour from everywhere to tell one
horrifying fact: even with the sanctions lifted, Iraq&#146;s problems will not find an
easy resolve anytime soon. Some of these problems, such as brain drain, crime and
homelessness, could take many years to treat. Others, such as the depleted uranium, which
is used by the U.S. and the Allied armies (which has a life span of 4.5 million years),
require more than a few years to resolve.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most vulnerable targets for this war of sanctions are those who
have very little means to resist&#133;children.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the studies conducted by both governmental and non-governmental
organizations show that the number of children who die every month as a direct result of
the sanctions range between 200-250 children under the age of five.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others argue that the above number is not a fair estimate, because many
more deaths go unreported, especially in poor and rural areas in southern and northern
Iraq. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UNICEF&#146;s moderate statistics show that one out of every four
children in Iraq is malnourished. According to UNICEF&#146;s most current report,
malnutrition was not known anywhere in Iraq before the sanctions. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those children who survive malnutrition encounter many other obstacles
in their lives, especially in school. &#147;For those who don&#146;t die or become very
ill, their ability to learn and function properly is impaired, and their capacity to reach
their full potential is in great danger&#148;, Ms. Singh stated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others lack the strength to face other diseases, because their immune
systems don&#146;t function properly. For example, according to UNICEF, a child&#146;s
chances of dying from measles are 400 times greater if he is malnourished. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shortage of immunizations has dramatically increased the chances of
death from diseases, which were previously unknown in Iraq, such as polio.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These numbers and statistics come to life once you walk in the streets
of Baghdad and once you wander through its impoverished markets. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics regarding homelessness can never draw the same picture that
the groups of begging Iraqi children can draw. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Haifa Street, I witnessed a 20-member gang of Iraqi children between
the ages of 5 and 10 approach a man. A child asked for money to buy food. He pointed at
his mouth and belly as a sign of hunger. The man reached in his pocket with enthusiasm and
handed the boy a full dollar. Then he declared, &#147;I have no more money, that is
it.&#148; The man left behind 20 children beating each other with the hope that one of
them might eat that night.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was only then that I saw the real face of Baghdad&#133;and what a
sorrowful face that was.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Part 15</p>

<p ALIGN="center">By Israel Shahak </i></b><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i><u><b>Saving of Life</b></u></i><br>
This subject - the supreme value of human life and the obligation of every human being to
do the outmost to save the life of a fellow human - is of obvious importance in itself. It
is also of particular interest in a Jewish context, in view of the fact that since the
second world war Jewish opinion has - in some cases justly, in others unjustly - condemned
'the whole world' or at least all Europe for standing by when Jews were being massacred.
Let us therefore examine what the Halakhah has to say on this subject.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Halakhah, the duty to save the life of a fellow Jew is
paramount.<sup> </sup>It supersedes all other religious obligations and interdictions,
excepting only the prohibitions against the three most heinous sins of adultery (including
incest), murder and idolatry.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Gentiles, the basic talmudic principle is that their lives <i>must
not </i>be saved, although it is also forbidden to murder them outright. The Talmud itself<sup>
</sup>expresses this in the maxim 'Gentiles are neither to be lifted [out of a well] nor
hauled down [into it]&#146;. Maimonides<sup> </sup>explains:</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<blockquote>
  </font><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Gentiles with whom we are not at war ... their death must
  not be caused, but it is forbidden to save them if they are at the point of death; if, for
  example, one of them is seen falling into the sea, he should not be rescued, for it is
  written: 'neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy fellow&#146;<sup> </sup>- but
  [a Gentile] is not thy fellow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, a Jewish doctor must not treat a Gentile patient.
Maimonides - himself an illustrious physician - is quite explicit on this; in another
passage he repeats the distinction between 'thy fellow' and a Gentile, and concludes: 'and
from this learn ye, that it is forbidden to heal a Gentile even for payment &#133;&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the refusal of a Jew - particularly a Jewish doctor - to save
the life of a Gentile may, if it becomes known, antagonise powerful Gentiles and so put <i>Jews
</i>in danger. Where such danger exists, the obligation to avert it supersedes the ban on
helping the Gentile. Thus Maimonides continues: ' ... but if you fear him or his
hostility, cure him for payment, though you are forbidden to do so without payment.' In
fact, Maimonides himself was Saladin's personal physician. His insistence on demanding
payment - presumably in order to make sure that the act is not one of human charity but an
unavoidable duty - is however not absolute. For in another passage he allows Gentile whose
hostility is feared to be treated 'even gratis, if it is unavoidable'. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole doctrine - the ban on saving a Gentile's life or healing him,
and the suspension of this ban in cases where there is fear of hostility - is repeated
(virtually verbatim) by other major authorities, including the 14th century <i>Arba'ah
Turim </i>and Karo's <i>Beyt Yosef </i>and <i>Shulhan </i>'<i>Arukh.</i> <i>Beyt Yosef </i>adds,
quoting Mairnomdes: 'And it is permissible to try out a drug on a heathen, if this serves
a purpose'; and this is repeated also by the famous R. Moses Isserles.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consensus of halakhic authorities is that the term 'Gentiles' in
the above doctrine refers to <i>all </i>non-Jews. A lone voice of dissent is that of R.
Moses Rivkes, author of a minor commentary on the <i>Shulhan Arukh, </i>who writes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our sages only said this about heathens, who in their day worshipped
  idols and did not believe in the Jewish Exodus from Egypt or in the creation of the world <i>ex
  nihilo. </i>But the Gentiles in whose [protective] shade we, the people of Israel, are
  exiled and among whom we are scattered do believe in the creation of the world <i>ex
  nihilo </i>and in the Exodus and in several principles of our own religion and they pray
  to the Creator of heaven and earth...Not only is there no interdiction against helping
  them, but we are even obliged to pray for their safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This passage, dating from the second half of the 17th century, is a
favourite quote of apologetic scholars.<sup> </sup>Actually, it does not go nearly as far
as the apologetics pretend, for it advocates <i>removing the </i>ban on saving a Gentile's
life, rather than making it <i>mandatory </i>as in the case of a Jew; and even this
liberality extends only to Christians and Muslims but not the majority of human beings.
Rather, what it does show is that there was a way in which the harsh doctrine of the
Halakhah <i>could have been </i>progressively liberalised. But as a matter of fact the
majority of later halakhic authorities, far from extending Rivkes' leniency to other human
groups, have rejected it altogether.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Desecrating the Sabbath to Save Life</u></b></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Desecrating the sabbath - that is, doing work that would otherwise be
banned on Saturday- becomes a duty when the need to save a Jew's life demands it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of saving a Gentile's life on the sabbath is not raised in
the Talmud as a main issue, since it is in any case forbidden even on a weekday; it does
however enter as a complicating factor in two connections.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there is a problem where a group of people are in danger, and it
is possible (but not certain) that there is at least one Jew among them; should the
sabbath be desecrated in order to save them? There is an extensive discussion of such
cases. Following earlier authorities, including Maimonides and the Talmud itself, the <i>Shulhan
'Arukh<sup> </sup></i>decides these matters according to the weight of probabilities. For
example, suppose nine Gentiles and one Jew live in the same building. One Saturday the
building collapses; one of the ten - it is not known which one - Is away, but the other
nine are trapped under the rubble. Should the rubble be cleared, thus desecrating the
sabbath, seeing that the Jew may not be under it (he may have been the one that got away)?
The <i>Shulhan 'Arukh </i>says that it should, presumably because the odds that the Jew is
under the rubble are high (nine to one). But now suppose that nine have got away and only
one - again, it is not known which one - is trapped. Then there is no duty to clear the
rubble, presumably because this time there are long odds (nine to one) <i>against </i>the
Jew being the person trapped. Similarly: 'If a boat containing some Jews is seen to be in
peril upon the sea, it is a duty incumbent upon all to desecrate the sabbath in order to
save it.' However, the great R. 'Aqiva Eiger (died 1837) comments that this applies only
'when it is known that there are Jews on board. But ... if nothing at all is known -about
the identity of those on board. [the sabbath] must not be desecrated, for one acts
according to [the weight of probabilities, and] the majority of people in the world are
Gentiles.' Thus, since there are very long odds against any of the passengers being
Jewish, they must be allowed to drown.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the provision that a Gentile may be saved or cared for in
order to avert the danger of hostility is curtailed on the sabbath. A Jew called upon to
help a Gentile on a weekday may have to comply because to admit that he is not allowed, in
principle, to save the life of a non-Jew would be to invite hostility. But on Saturday the
Jew can use sabbath observance as a plausible excuse. A paradigmatic case discussed at
length in the Talmud<sup> </sup>is that of a Jewish midwife invited to help a Gentile
woman in childbirth. The upshot is that the midwife is allowed to help on a weekday 'for
fear of hostility', but on the sabbath she must not do so, because she can excuse herself
by saying: 'We are allowed to desecrate the sabbath only for our own, who observe the
sabbath, but for your people, who do not keep the sabbath, we are not allowed to desecrate
it.' Is this explanation a genuine one or merely an excuse? Maimonides clearly thinks that
it is just an excuse, which can be used even if the task that the midwife is invited to do
does not actually involve any desecration of the sabbath. Presumably, the excuse will work
just as well even in this case, because Gentiles are generally in the dark as to precisely
which kinds of work are banned for Jews on the sabbath. At any rate, he decrees: 'A
Gentile woman must not be helped in childbirth on the sabbath, even for payment; nor must
one fear hostility, even when [such help involves] no desecration of the sabbath.' The <i>Shu1han
Anukh </i>decrees likewise.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, this sort of excuse could not always be relied upon to do
the trick and avert Gentile hostility. Therefore, certain important rabbinical authorities
had to relax the rules to some extent and allowed Jewish doctors to treat Gentiles on the
sabbath even if this involved doing certain types of work normally banned on that day.
This partial relaxation applied particularly to rich and powerful Gentile patients, who
could not be fobbed off so easily and whose hostility could be dangerous.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, R. Yo'el Sirkis, author of <i>Bayit Hadash </i>and one of the
greatest rabbis of his time (Poland, 17th century), decided that 'mayors, petty nobles and
aristocrats' should be treated on the sabbath, because of the fear of their hostility
which involves 'some danger'. But in other cases, especially when the Gentile can be
fobbed off with an evasive excuse, a Jewish doctor would commit 'an unbearable sin' by
treating him on the sabbath. Later in the same century, a similar verdict was given in the
French city of Metz, whose two parts were connected by a pontoon bridge. Jews are not
normally allowed to cross such a bridge on the sabbath, but the rabbi of Metz decided that
a Jewish doctor may nevertheless do so 'if he is called to the great governor': since the
doctor is known to cross the bridge for the sake of his Jewish patients, the governor's
hostility could be aroused if the doctor refused to do so for his sake. Under the
authoritarian rule of Louis XIV, it was evidently important to have the goodwill of his
intendant; the feelings of lesser Gentiles were of little importance.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Hokhmat Shlomoh, </i>a 19th century commentary on the <i>Sbu1han
'Arukh, </i>mentions a similarly strict interpretation of the concept 'hostility' in
connection with the Karaites, a small heretical Jewish sect. According to this view, their
lives must not be saved if that would involve desecration of the sabbath, 'for
&quot;hostility&quot; applies only to the heathen, who are many against us, and we are
delivered into their hands.. But the Karaites are few and we are not delivered into their
hands, [so] the fear of hostility does not apply to them at all.<sup> </sup>In fact, the <i>absolute
</i>ban on desecrating the sabbath in order to save the life of a Karaite is still in
force today, as we shall see.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole subject is extensively discussed in the <i>responsa </i>of R
.Moshe Sofer- better known as 'Hatam Sofer' &#150; the famous rabbi of Pressburg
(Bratislava) who died in 1832. His conclusions are of more than historical interest, since
in 1966 one of his <i>responsa </i>was publicly endorsed by the then Chief Rabbi of Israel
as 'a basic institution of the Halakhah'.<sup> </sup>The particular question asked of
Hatam Sofer concerned the situation in Turkey, where it was decreed during one of the wars
that in each township or village there should be midwives on call, ready to hire
themselves out to any woman in labour. Some of these midwives were Jewish; should they
hire themselves out to help Gentile women on weekdays and on the sabbath?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his <i>responsum,<sup> </sup></i>Hatam Sofer first concludes, after
careful investigation, that the Gentiles concerned- that is, Ottoman Christians and
Muslims- are not only idolators 'who definitely worship other gods and thus should
&quot;neither be lifted [out of a well] nor hauled down&quot;, ' but are likened by him to
the Amalekites, so that the talmudic ruling 'it is forbidden to multiply the seed of
Amalek' applies to them. In principle, therefore, they should not be helped even on
weekdays. However, in practice it is 'permitted' to heal Gentiles and help them in labour,
if they have doctors and midwives of their own, who could be called instead of the Jewish
ones. For if Jewish doctors and midwives refused to attend to Gentiles, the only result
would be loss of income to the former which is of course undesirable. This applies'
equally on weekdays and on the sabbath, provided no desecration of the sabbath is
involved. However, in the latter case the sabbath can serve as an excuse to 'mislead the
heathen woman and say that it would involve desecration of the sabbath'.</p>

</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Intifada in Rafah- In a little hospital not far
from the refugee camp of Rafah, Ahmed, a 14 year-old Palestinian boy, died. The attempts
of the doctors at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to save the boy&#146;s life were
unsuccessful.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Abu Ahmed stood at his son&#146;s bedside as the
doctors&#146; last frantic efforts failed. One year earlier, Abu Ahmed witnessed almost
the same scenario with Bassel, Ahmed&#146;s oldest brother. The tears for the newly dead
son Ahmed blended with the tears for Bassel the dead son of one year, and burrowed their
way down the old man&#146;s dry wrinkled cheeks. The smell of antiseptics saturated the
atmosphere. Death was everywhere. The old man felt his knees cave in and his head spin.
The world turned upside down.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">It was as though he were in a different place,
but he could feel cold hands, almost as cold as death gently pick his body up and place it
on a smooth soothing pedestal. Ahhhhhh, he did so desperately need something to soothe
him. He drifted to the not so long ago past when Bassel had been shot in the head. A
recurring nightmare that he could never escape. He relived the incident each time he
dreamed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">It had been in January and as usual, the
Palestinians youths had been goaded by Israeli soldiers into retaliating their injustices
and occupation by throwing stones. Stones were the inmates&#146; only weapons. A small
stone thrown at a heavily armed soldier or an armored jeep or tank. What could a small
stone do? In Bassel&#146;s case, the small stone got him a rubber bullet in the head.
Someone had run into Abu Ahmed&#146;s small coffee shop where he had just served a
steaming cup of Turkish coffee to an old friend and customer and screamed, &#147;Abu
Ahmed, come quick, Bassel&#146;s been shot!&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">He didn&#146;t remember how his legs carried him
to where his son&#146;s blood trickled into the dust of the refugee camp. His heart fell
with a large thump at the sight of his son sprawling. He saw his son&#146;s life pumping
out of him as his blood throbbed into the arid ground. Plants in Rafah were watered with
blood, the blood of Palestinian youths.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">The old man knelt down and grabbed the now matted
dark mass of hair that Bassel had kept so well groomed before the shooting. The eyes of
Bassel had rolled back but when Abu Ahmed put his head on the boy&#146;s chest, he could
feel his son&#146;s heart still beating. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Immediately, an ambulance arrived at the scene
and paramedics jumped down with a stretcher and carried the body of Bassel away. By now
the boy&#146;s family had arrived and the father, mother, and some of his sons piled into
a car and sped off behind the ambulance. Suddenly they approached an Israeli roadblock
near Khan Younis. An Israeli soldier shouted at the men saying, &#147;get out of the car,
all of you!&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">The old man, his sons and his wife got out of the
car. At once they were pounced upon by other Israeli soldiers who commenced to savagely
beat them. Abu Ahmed&#146;s wife screamed and begged. &#147;Please, let them go. Our son
has been shot in the head and may be dying!&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">She got nowhere. Her screams of protest went
unheard, her pleading unnoticed. After her husband and sons were beaten, they were ordered
to clear a street of its roadblocks. They could do nothing but comply. Later, after the
beaten family finally got back in the car and resumed their journey, they were once again
stopped at another checkpoint near the Nasser Hospital in Gaza.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">At last they arrived at the hospital. The family
beaten and bloody rushed in to search for Bassel. Was he dead or alive? Bassel, 16, had
been taken to the Pediatric Intensive care Unit to try to save his life. When his family
entered the room, the youth had already been placed on life support systems and was
unconscious. It had been decided to move the boy to an Israeli hospital and for some
humane reason, a helicopter had been sent to transfer the wounded boy. But when Abu Ahmed
and his family went to the landing pad to accompany the wounded Bassel, they were stopped
by some armed Jewish settlers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">One of the settlers hissed, &#147;Stop right
here. Go no further!&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Other settlers grabbed his sons and began to beat
them in front of their wounded and weary father. &#147;You have almost killed my
son,&#148; said Abu Ahmed, &#147;are you going to kill the others too?&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">And, now somewhere in his sorrowful
unconsciousness the old father saw the settlers finally allow the family to accompany the
near-dying Bassel. But later he died at the hospital he was transferred to. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">The old father didn&#146;t want to wake up. What
was there to wake up to? Bassel had died from a bullet wound to his head. A year later,
Ahmed had now died too. He too had been shot in the head. The remaining three other sons
were being held in administrative detention without a court hearing. Where was it all
going to end and when would tragedy stop plaguing the old man and his family?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">He drifted back to the real world, to the smooth
soothing bed had had been placed on when he fainted. He drifted back to the smell of
antiseptics and the dank smell of death, of Ahmed&#146;s death. But the old man could not
give up and die too though surely death was easier and perhaps heaven awaited such a good
old man who had lost nearly everything in this world. Yet he had a fighting urge to live.
He had to live, he had to try to help get his three living sons out of prison.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">At first the Israeli army demanded that the body
of young Ahmed could not be buried in the same cemetery next to the body of Bassel. But
eventually, the body of Ahmed was placed next to Bassel&#146;s. A huge funeral procession
had accompanied Ahmed&#146;s body and once again, a martyred son of the old man was laid
to rest.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Abu Ahmed and his family are living symbols and
heroes to other Palestinians. They are neither rich nor powerful. They are twice-over
refugees with little money. But they are as noble as they come. Abu Ahmed and his family,
both the living and the dead are heroes, the unsung heroes. </font></p>
