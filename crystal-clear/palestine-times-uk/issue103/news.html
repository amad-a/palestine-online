<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA cracks down on critics following <br>
dissemination of scathing petition</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> &#150; <b>From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In what seems to reflect a fledgling but growing contention between the
official Palestinian establishment and the nationalist-liberal opposition, the PA reacted
strongly earlier in December to silence and punish a group of intellectuals and civic
leaders who had earlier disseminated a petition castigating &#147;PA corruption and
tyranny and calling on the masses to rise up to save the homeland before it is too
late.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition, which appeared on 27 November, described the six years that
have passed since the signing of the Oslo Accords as &#147;a terrifying scenario of
deception and mendacity, the outcome of which will be undoubtedly felt deeply and
painfully in the final status talks.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We were promised a State whose capital is Jerusalem, repatriation of
the refugees, dismantling of the settlements, freedom for the prisoners and an economic
transformation which would make of us the Singapore of the region; but what we see is that
more of our land has been usurped, settlements expanded, and plots against the
refugees&#146; cause accelerated rapidly behind the scenes and the gates of prisons locked
on our sons; neither Jerusalem was recovered, nor Singapore&#146;s advent came about, and
the people are now divided into two groups&#151;one oppressing and extorting; and a larger
one grieving and looking for a deliverer.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition accused the PA of adopting a <i>modus operandi</i> of
&#147;graft, corruption, humiliation and exploitation of the Palestinian people&#148; and
&#147;of turning the Oslo process into a formula whereby the Palestinian cause is
liquidated in return for some corrupt PA elements getting rich.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, what infuriated the PA leadership most was the petition&#146;s
direct and audacious attack against Yasser Arafat, the ultimate red-line and sacrosanct
cow in the PA regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The PA President,&#148; said the leaflet, &#147;has widely opened
the doors for the opportunists to spread corruption throughout the country,&#148; adding
that, consequently, &#147;our economic conditions have worsened, social bonds have
weakened, and our health, educational and judicial institutions ruined.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the signatories called on the masses to rise to correct the
Palestinian march before it is too late.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The bell of danger must be sounded in every village, town and
refugee camp; in every corner and lobby; even in every shop, home and office because the
homeland is being sold out and the citizen is betrayed and decimated.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The 20 signatories of the document included 9 legislative council (PLC)
members, 3 university professors, 3 physicians and 5 leftist and centrist political
activists. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the signers were the wheelchair-bound former mayor of Nablus, Bassam
al-Shaka&#146;a, who lost both legs in a car bomb planted by Jewish terrorists in 1981;
Abdul Sattar Kassem, who was the target of an assassination attempt by pro-Arafat elements
in 1994; and Ahmed Qatamesh, the West Bank leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, who was freed from an Israeli jail earlier this year after spending six and
a half years of &#147;administrative detention&#148; without charge or trial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kassem, Qatamesh, and seven other signatories, who are not PLC members,
were arrested on 28 and 29 November, immediately after their signing, while Shaka&#146;a
and Wahid al-Hamdulla, the former mayor of Anabta (a town of 20,000 near Nablus) were
placed under house arrest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to PLC member Husam Khader, one of the co-signers, the petition
was leaked to the press prematurely, as the original intention was to get it signed by
tens of thousands of Palestinians in order, as he said, to &#147;send a clear message to
Arafat that enough is enough.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khader, a popular Fatah leader who enjoys widespread support in the large
refugee camp of Balata near Nablus, sounded unapologetic and uncompromising.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We felt we had to choose between loyalty to the President and
loyalty to the homeland,&#148; Khader said in a telephone interview on 28 November.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same tone was reiterated by another defiant co-signer, Hassan
Khreisha, chairman of the PLC Human Rights and Oversight Committee, who said there was no
reason to shy away from criticism of PA President Yasser Arafat if and when needed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What is of more value, the leader or the homeland? I believe the
homeland is larger than the leader&#133;whoever he may be.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A third co-signer, PLC member Abdul Jawad Saleh, was even more defiant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He told over 2,000 college students at Beir Zeit University on 29 November
that &#147;if we have to choose between Arafat and the homeland, we will chose the
homeland.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No distinction between PA excesses and Israeli occupation&#146;s crimes</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, the PA described the petition as &#147;a divisive sheet
besmirching our national struggle and undermining our national interest.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA minister without portfolio, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, criticized the
petitioners, saying they made no distinction between PA excesses and the Israeli
occupation&#146;s crimes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Yes, there are excesses, but the Israelis are ultimately responsible
for most of our difficulties.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the PA leadership, which has threatened to remove parliamentary
immunity from the nine PLC members who co-signed the leaflet to pave the way for their
arrest and prosecution for incitement, is facing a real dilemma dealing with the matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Legally speaking, stripping a law-maker of his parliamentary immunity
would require the approval of two thirds of the 88-member Legislative Council, a task
informed Palestinian sources opine will not be easy for Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But even if the PA President fulfilled his ostensible (but not necessarily
genuine) threat and did succeed in stripping the nine councillors of their parliamentary
immunity, that could spell trouble for his leadership and seriously undermine his image
among Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The councillors, it must be remembered, are generally prominent
nationalist leaders in their respective communities and enjoy significant support among
the Fatah rank and file.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, most of them belong to large Palestinian clans, such as
Al-Shawwa in Gaza, and al-Masri and Shaka&#146;a in Nablus, and any stringent measure by
the PA against them could draw a boomerang effect from these clans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, the PA leadership would also lose much if it allowed the
petitioners to emerge victorious from this showdown, because then the burgeoning protest
movement against &#147;corruption and tyranny&#148; would gain momentum and acquire
additional strength, the last thing Arafat would like to see in this sensitive juncture
when the PA and Israel are negotiating the fundamental final status issues of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One close confidant of Arafat told a weekly newspaper that the Palestinian
leadership would be fighting a losing battle if it did not start listening to the
&#147;heartbeats of the ordinary man in the street.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few days before the petition was published, hundreds of indigent Gazans
took to the streets to protest the high prices of flour, the main strategic commodity in
the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The protesters attacked &#147;the hidden mafia that is sucking our
blood,&#148; and only stopped short of attacking the Palestinian leadership itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The protest did force Arafat to order a significant decrease in the prices
of flour and fuel, a key demand of the protesters. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It may now be prudent for the PA to try to let things calm down, because
escalation will be in nobody&#146;s interest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, calming things down <i>per se</i> will not make the crisis
disappear if genuine reform is not soon forthcoming. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Text of the leaflet that angered Yasser Arafat</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The following is an unofficial translation of the
leaflet that was supposed to be signed by tens of thousands of Palestinians were it not
for the arrest of its original signatories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The homeland is calling&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are pained by what is happening on the sacred land of Palestine, of
displaying utter disregard for the people and selling out their rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We, as ordinary citizens, motivated by our loyalty to the homeland, feel
compelled to speak out to you in order to work together to correct the lamentable state of
affairs that we have reached.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following Oslo (the signing of the Oslo Agreement in 1993), the
Palestinian leadership claimed the accords would enable us to establish a State whose
capital is Jerusalem, repatriate the refugees, dismantle the settlements, free the
prisoners and pave the way for an economic transformation that would make us the Singapore
of the region. Indeed, some of us were so deceived that we took to the streets to
celebrate the false victories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, six years after Oslo, more of our land has been usurped,
settlements expanded, plots against the cause of the refugees are accelerating rapidly
behind the scenes, and the gates of prisons are locked on our sons; neither Jerusalem was
recovered, nor Singapore&#146;s advent came about, and the people were divided into two
groups&#151;a small one that is oppressing and extorting, and a larger one grieving and
looking for a deliverer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a horrible scenario of deception and mendacity, the outcome of which
will undoubtedly be felt deeply and painfully in the final status talks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from that, the Palestinian Authority has adopted a <i>modus operandi</i>
of graft, corruption, humiliation and exploitation of the Palestinian people. Indeed, the
Oslo Agreement now appears to be the vehicle for the selling-out of the homeland in return
for some corrupt and corrupting elements within the PA as a means to their getting rich. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA president has opened the doors widely for the opportunists to
spread corruption in the larger Palestinian street. The economic conditions have worsened,
social bonds have become weaker, the moral values of our people have become lax, and
destruction has befallen many of our health, educational and judicial institutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the bells of danger must be sounded in every village, town and
refugee camp; in every corner and lobby; even in every shop, home and office. The homeland
is being sold out and the citizen is being betrayed and decimated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, let us stand together in the face of this tyranny and corruption. The
oppression will not be stopped save at the hands of the oppressed, and the oppressor will
only be stopped through strength and determination of the faithful.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Torture is continuing in Israel <br>
despite High Court&#146;s decision</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Physical and psychological torture of Palestinian detainees by Israeli
interrogators is continuing unabated in Israeli jails and detention centres, according to
human rights organizations operating in the occupied territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to prisoners&#146; testimonies, the Shabah method (covering a
detainee&#146;s head with a stinking bag for prolonged periods) and many forms of beating
are still being used on a large scale in Israeli prisons.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 9 December, the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG)
reported that three young men from Bethlehem sere severely tortured in the Russian
Compound lockup in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the PHRMG report, Muhammed Ali Hameed Souman, 17, from
Breitha&#146;a al-Ta&#146;amreh near Bethlehem, was subjected to intermittent torture for
several weeks, apparently for the purpose of extracting confessions from him relating to
his political affiliation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Souman was arrested in his home on 24 August and taken to the Russian
Compound where he was interrogated for 55 days. The first 25 days he was tortured
severely. They covered his head with a dirty bag and forced him to sit in painful
positions (Shabah) for long periods. Furthermore, they forced him into a very small and
narrow cupboard where he could not move at all. The pain of torture forced Muhammed to
confess to charges relating to his membership in the Islamic Jihad movement. His lawyer
was not allowed to meet with him until 40 days after his arrest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ali Issa al-Wahsh, 20, also from al-Ta&#146;amreh, was also arrested on 24
August. He was interrogated for 70 days, during which time he said he was beaten and
tortured severely. He was not allowed to use the toilet for some days; his health
deteriorated, but he was not taken to hospital nor received medical care. As a result of
the torture, al-Wahsh was forced to confess that he was a member of the Islamic Jihad
organization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A third youth subjected to torture was Ra&#146;ed Ahmed Salem al-Hamri,
19, also from al-Ta&#146;amreh. He was arrested at his home on 21 August 1999. He spent
the first night in the Atsion jail, and then was transferred to the Russian Compound
lockup where he spent 62 days under interrogation. He testified that he was beaten and
tortured and that Israeli interrogators put burning cigarettes on his body and forced him
to sit in painful positions. During the interrogation, he was hospitalized at &#147;Pikur
Holem&#148; on 22 September as his health deteriorated badly during the torture. Al-Hamri
was accused of being a member of the Islamic Jihad, and as a result of the torture, he
confessed to the charges.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several other cases of torture have been reported at the prisons of Nafha,
Beir al-Sab&#146;a and Askalan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Palestinian human rights organization
&#147;Tadamun&#148;, or solidarity, Israeli prison officials and interrogators are
increasingly resorting to beating and solitary confinement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In early December, Israeli prison police even shot tear gas inside the
small cells of Palestinian inmates, causing several of them to faint.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tadamun quoted some prisoners as saying that prison police often
deliberately provoke the prisoners in order to create a pretext to beat and punish them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In September, the Israeli High Court ruled that the employment of torture
against detainees is illegal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ruling said the use of various interrogation techniques by the General
Security Service (GSS) is illegal, including torture or ill-treatment of detainees during
interrogation. The international community and human rights organizations welcomed the
decision.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the ruling, the GSS suspended the use of harsh forms of torture
for some time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is clear now that the ruling is not being implemented and that
torture is still the chief mode of operation in Israeli jails. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Two Hamas fighters martyred</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron</b> <b>&#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli undercover soldiers attacked with anti-tank rockets on 13 December
a house in the village of Beit Awwa, 20 kilometres west of Hebron, in which two Hamas
fugitives were hiding. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two fugitives are Iyad al-Battat, who the Israeli authorities claim is
responsible for several attacks on Israeli targets, and Nader Masalmeh, a local village
activist who was at the house.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army claimed the two Hamas fugitives started the shooting,
prompting the soldiers to return fire and kill them both.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, eyewitnesses dismissed the Israeli account as &#147;an exposed
lie&#148; and &#147;mere propaganda.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli army cordoned off the
village, situated along the former armistice line between Israel and the West Bank,
several hours before the shooting, which meant that the Israeli undercover units were
intent on spilling blood in Beit Awwa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The eyewitnesses pointed out that hundreds of Israeli soldiers were
involved in the ambush, in addition to a helicopter gunship, using anti-tank rockets
against Battat, who was armed with a single AK-47 rifle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials boasted about the ambush and even suggested that the PA
helped with intelligence information. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told the Israeli radio on 15
December that &#147;we made a promise to kill them within a year and I am happy to say
that we fulfilled our promise.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear if the PA security agencies were involved in the incident.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas sources said prior to the incident, Preventive Security Chief Jebril
Rajoub had urged Battat&#146;s father to convince his son to surrender himself because
&#147;he is going to be liquidated.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, a PA security patrol erected a roadblock at an intersection
leading to Beit Awwa and advised Palestinians not to proceed to the village in light of
the Israeli operation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas vowed to retaliate. A movement&#146;s spokesman in Gaza, Ismael Abu
Shanab, said the Israeli ambush was unprovoked, suggesting that Israel violated an
undeclared truce between the two sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many of Hamas fighters were assassinated or ambushed by the Israeli army,
probably in connivance with PA forces.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, there have been consistent reports that Hamas is rebuilding its
military wing, making use of the wide public disillusionment with the Oslo process among
the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Hamas&#146;s &#147;tactical setback&#148; does not seem to have
an effect on the Movement&#146;s popularity in the West Bank and, indeed, on its
traditional stance on the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, said Hamas would
&#147;continue to cling to the path of resistance until we restore our rights.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin, who was speaking on 17 December during a rally in Gaza marking the
twelfth anniversary of Hamas foundation, told over 30,000 supporters that he had no doubt
that the current peace process would collapse because it is not based on justice and it is
unaccepted by the vast majority of Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They are trying to liquidate the Palestinian question under the
cover of the so-called peace process, but we will not allow them to do so because we have
legitimate rights that ought to be recovered.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Israel dictates her stance to Arafat</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Israeli and Palestinian Authority (PA)
negotiators have again failed to reach an agreement on the implementation of the second
redeployment stipulated in the revised Wye River Memorandum, or what is known as the Sharm
el-Sheikh agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For despite a spate of optimistic statements by Israeli and PA officials
that progress was being made, effectively no progress was reported.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PA leader Yasser Arafat met in
Ramallah on 21 December in an additional effort to get the talks going.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, one PA official described the talks as &#147;general&#148; and
&#147;lacking in detail.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that the two sides were not only talking but thinking at
cross-purposes became apparent in the subsequent meeting between PA negotiator Sa&#146;eb
Ureikat and his Israeli counterpart Odid Eran in West Jerusalem on 22 December.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ureikat told reporters following the meeting that no real progress was
made. He accused the Israelis of &#147;putting up an intransigent position&#148; and of
&#147;creating a false impression that progress was being made when in fact the Israeli
position is unchanged.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, there seemed a certain inconsistency in the statements of PA
officials concerning the meeting between Barak and Arafat. Arafat&#146;s advisor, Nabil
Abu Rudeina, had described the meeting as &#147;friendly and serious&#148; and that
&#147;its results would become apparent in a few days.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Abu Rudeina did not give any details, nor said which side
retreated from its stance on the second redeployment, or whether Israel agreed to take
Palestinian objections to the redeployment map into account.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Gaza Preventive Security Chief Muhammed Dahlan accused Israel of
contravening the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan was right. The Israeli government seemed insistent upon carrying
out the redeployment as it saw fit without any consideration for the Palestinian views or
demands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This stance was reiterated by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who
attended the Ramallah meeting. He pointed out that Israel did not give any concessions to
the Palestinians, suggesting that it was up to the PA to retreat and accept the Israeli
offer &#147;as it is.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He repeated the Israeli claim that Israel alone had the exclusive right to
determine the scope and extent of the redeployment, as well as all matters pertaining to
the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian observers, the Israeli tactic is to make the PA
rotate in an empty circle of meetings and encounters in the hope that this would
eventually frustrate Yasser Arafat and push him to budge, as he has always done under such
circumstances.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian position is actually further weakened by the effective
American connivance with Israel over the redeployment impasse. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, when U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Palestine
recently, she actually lent tacit support for the Israeli position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Far from endorsing the Palestinian position, which Arafat had hoped she
would, Albright said the parties alone should settle their differences without external
interference.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In reality, this amounts to giving Israel the right and freedom to
&#147;impose and dictate&#148; its position on an increasingly vulnerable and autocratic
Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Arafat, who is now preoccupied with the Bethlehem-2000
celebration, is supposed to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton probably in the second
week of January. (Arafat considers a mere meeting with the President of the United States
a great achievement.) In this meeting, pundits believe Arafat will announce his acceptance
of the Israeli plan for redeployment, and, still more, may give additional concessions
concerning the final status talks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In return, it is expected that Clinton, who is becoming a lame duck, will
confirm American commitment to the peace process and support for the Palestinians&#146;
right to self-determination. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the ground, these statements would practically mean nothing, as they
were uttered several times in the past but have had little or no effect on the actual
pro-Israeli American position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Israeli paper <i>Ma&#146;ariv</i> disclosed on 23 December
that Israel prepared a policy paper whereby no more than 50% of the West Bank would be
handed over to the Palestinian Authority in the context of a final peace arrangement
between the two sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other half of the West Bank, according to the document, would be
annexed to Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The document seemed to be genuine and authentic. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, Odid Eran, who represents Israel in both the interim phase and
final status talks with the Palestinians, actually conveyed this position to his
Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbou on 19 December.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He reportedly told him that Israel was planning to annex most of the
Jewish settlements in the West Bank in the context of the final settlement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of this fact, it is very likely that the current
on-again/off-again talks between the two sides would actually collapse, especially if a
breakthrough is reached on the Syrian track.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in case this actually happens, Arafat would likely resort to
unilaterally declaring Palestinian Statehood on the 10%-20% of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip he now runs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As to what will happen next, the coming months will tell.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Arafat dreads progress on Syrian track</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>Despite public statements to the contrary, the
Palestinian leadership has been clearly worried about the resumption of peace talks
between Israel and Syria and the effect of an increasingly possible Israeli-Syrian peace
treaty on the Palestinian question.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, since U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who visited the
region in the second week of December, announced the resumption of the talks between the
two implacable enemies, the Palestinian issue has been, more or less, placed on the back
burner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Albright herself, along with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, utterly
failed to get the &#147;PA-Israeli tracks&#148; moving again, having been virtually
deadlocked by Israel&#146;s utter refusal to consider Palestinian demands regarding the
transfer of an additional small territory to partial PA administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, aside from the usual diplomatic pleasantries, Albright
effectively rebuffed the Palestinian Authority, which had been hoping to see the American
Secretary of State pressure Barak to soften his position on redeployment and settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The parties themselves ought to resolve their outstanding
differences,&#148; said Albright, effectively rendering a veto power to Israel in
interim-phase and final status talks with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This and other similar statements, needless to say, were a great
disappointment for the Palestinian leadership which began to seek a face-saving exit out
of this embarrassing predicament.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian anxiety well-founded</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian anxiety over the resumption of talks between Syria and Israel
is well-founded. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat is now watching the Palestinian track
take a backseat, not only as far as the United States is concerned but also in terms of
Israeli concentration and willingness to achieve real progress in the final status talks
with the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a clearer political language, this means that the Palestinian track
will be effectively frozen, or stalemated, owing to Israel&#146;s preoccupation with talks
with Syria and unwillingness to &#147;give out concessions on two fronts
concomitantly.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, coupled with the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian talks are already
rotating in an &#147;empty circle&#148;, as Arafat himself earlier described the talks,
means that the &#147;status quo,&#148; with all its crises and predicaments, will continue
to prevail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most conspicuous aspect of this unbearable &#147;status quo,&#148; as
far as the Palestinians are concerned, is, of course, the continued expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and to a lesser degree in the Gaza Strip as well. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In real terms, even if Israel and the PA do hold intensive talks, it is
unlikely that Ehud Barak will take any meaningful decision to freeze the construction of
additional Jewish settlements and the confiscation of Palestinian land in the occupied
territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA officials, including Arafat, rightly dismissed Barak&#146;s decision to
freeze the building of further settlements during the duration of talks with the
Palestinians (for 90 days) as &#147;a propaganda ruse.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The announcement to that effect, says PA negotiator Sa&#146;eb Ureikat, is
vacuous as the number of settlement projects is so vast that building could go on for at
least five more years unabated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian and Israeli sources alike point out that there are currently
over 6,000 settlement units under construction. In addition, Barak&#146;s promise to
freeze new settlement tenders does not pertain to Jerusalem.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Stepped-up expansion of settlements</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It goes without saying that a prolonged freeze on the Palestinian-Israeli
track will mean a stepped-up expansion of Jewish settlements, if only to blackmail the PA
into agreeing to rejoin the talks on Israel&#146;s terms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, if the PA refused, and it became apparent that the two sides
would not reach a framework agreement by February 2000, the erstwhile designated date for
reaching such an agreement, a crisis-atmosphere and frustration would prevail over the
Palestinian arena, particularly if a real breakthrough was reached between Syria and
Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, in case that breakthrough is consummated with a peace treaty leading,
for example, to the establishment of normal diplomatic and economic relations, not only
with Syria, but with the rest of the Arab countries supporting the peace process, e.g.
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, the Palestinian position would certainly be further
undermined.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, these prospects must look terribly ominous to the Palestinian
leadership, which has mistakenly calculated that the Arab regimes would not normalize with
Israel before the Palestinian issue was completely resolved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, one should remember that the bulk of Arab regimes are
despotic in nature and are more answerable to the United States than to their own masses
and will consequently normalize with Israel with or without the achievement of a
breakthrough on the Palestinian track.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the PA, which is now extremely unpopular among Arab masses
due to its connivance with the Zionists against Palestinian Islamist groups, will not be
able to bank on popular Arab support since the regimes are unlikely to allow any serious
popular movement to undermine the long-awaited peace with the Jewish State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the final analysis, a situation in which Israel enjoys &#147;peace
relations&#148; with all its neighbours (Jordan and Egypt along with Syria and Egypt)
would make Arafat&#146;s regime as vulnerable as ever to Israeli dictates and bullying.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in a situation like this, the beleaguered Palestinian leadership could
resort to either of two scenarios: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, creating a crisis situation for the purpose of forcing the United
States to re-focus attention on the Palestinian track, thus proving to all parties
concerned that &#147;there can be no peace and stability in the region without the
Palestinians.&#148; This crisis could take the form of large-scale demonstrations and
disturbances in various parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, particularly the so-called
&#147;friction spots.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, these tactics were tried in the past, and Israel always succeeded
in defusing them by giving Arafat some symbolic gestures but no substantive achievements
on the ground.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, if the crisis persisted and Arafat continued to fail to
make any real achievements, he would very likely declare a Palestinian State with a tacit
approval from Israel and the United States and support from the Arab countries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This in effect would be a belated recognition on Arafat&#146;s part that
Oslo was a failure as a small Palestinian entity on a small part of the West Bank, even if
recognized by Israel, would virtually leave the Israeli occupation in the bulk of the West
Bank and the settlements intact. In other words, the status quo will be frozen
indefinitely.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other scenario could take the form of Arafat giving far-reaching
concessions to Israel in the form of accepting a small Palestinian entity on 60%-70% of
the West Bank, without Jerusalem, on the ground that &#147;we have no choice&#148; and
&#147;this is all we could do under current circumstances.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this case&#151;Arafat&#146;s de facto capitulation to Israel&#151;the
United States would very likely provide his regime with generous financial assistance and
help strengthen his security agencies in order to enable him to crush popular protests
against the sell-out. (The U.S. has been silent on the arrest of the signatories of
Petition-20.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the imposed settlement will be absolutely oblique, inherently
unfair and by no means durable or acceptable to present or future Palestinian, Arab or
Muslim generations. It will be like a confession under duress, or marriage under duress,
meaning it would not last very long.</p>

pilgrims from leaving for Mecca</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Zionist occupation authorities, which controls
all border crossings from and to the occupied territories, have been baring hundreds of
Palestinians from travelling to Mecca for &quot;Omra&quot; or lesser pilgrimage. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said most of the returned pilgrims were college
students and lecturers, professionals, and generally young people below the age of 30. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Mansur Hasan, of the West Bank town of Jenin, he was turned
back because of his opposition to the peace process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;They told me at the Allenby Bridge (the main border crossing between
Jordan and the West Bank) that the Shabak (the Israeli domestic intelligence Service)
didn&#146;t allow me to travel,&quot; adding that &quot;I really don't know the
reason.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Mansur said while at the Allenby Bridge waiting to have the exit
visa, he was taken to a small chamber where Shabak officers questioned him on his
political convictions and views about the Oslo process, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority
and Israel. &quot;They told me that I would never be allowed to leave the West Bank as
long as continue to incite against Israel.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mansur described the Israeli measures against Palestinian pilgrims as
&quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;incompatible with the universally observed freedom of
religion.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Where in the world a person destined to visit the holy places of his
faith is turned back&#133;this is certainly the highest degree of injustice,&quot; he
said, siting verses from the Holy Quran. The same story was told by Ahmed al Sheikh also
from the town of Jenin, in the northern part of the West Bank. He related that as he
sought to leave for Saudi Arabia via Jordan, he was interrogated by Shabak officers
stationed at the Allenby bridge and told that he was not allowed to proceed to Mecca
because his two sons were in prison on charges of resisting the Zionist occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;They told me that they would take me, my wife, and our daughter to
the slaughter house (interrogation chambers) and would deface my daughter if we didn't
confess that we were not going to bring money for Hamas from Saudi Arabia. &quot;Al Sheikh
expressed profound indignation and bitterness at the fact that this violation of a man's
religious freedom takes place in the shadow of the so-called peace process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;What peace! What is the meaning of this process when we are denied
the right to perform a religious duty.&quot; </p>
