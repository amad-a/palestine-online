<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#0000FF">Arafat cracks down on his critics</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ever since 20 Palestinian intellectuals, professionals and Legislative
Council members issued their petition against Arafat&#146;s graft-ridden regime on 28
November, a number of non-conformist public figures, including two of the petitioners,
have been physically assaulted. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, one of the signatories of the petition, Legislative Council
member Muawiya al-Masri, was nearly killed when a group of masked men, armed with pistols
and axes, shot him three times outside his home on 7 December.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another signatory, councillor Abdul Jawad Saleh, was likewise physically
attacked by a group of General Intelligence agents on orders from Yasser Arafat while
visiting his fellow co-signers who were detained in a Jericho prison.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And while it may be premature to assert that the scattered incidents
constitute a phenomenon, it is absolutely certain that the defenders of human rights and
civil liberties, in addition to many ordinary citizens, are looking increasingly ominously
to the future and to the gloomy prospects of the PA sliding into a police State where
civil liberties are suppressed, mouths are muzzled, human rights are strangled, and
peoples&#146; dignity are trodden upon by State terror.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All this with one difference in the peculiar Palestinian context: the fact
that the PA is already, or on its way to becoming a police State&#133;without a State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, these fears and apprehensions seem to be genuine&#151;if not
outright justified&#151;for two reasons, not to mention the long and shameful record of
the PA regime since it was established more than six years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the PA has not apprehended the perpetrators of these cowardly acts,
which raises genuine suspicions surrounding the implication of certain power centres
within the PA in these acts that befit gangsters, hoodlums and bandits. The PA does has a
very efficient intelligence apparatus, hence apprehending the perpetrators shouldn&#146;t
be a very difficult task to achieve.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Secondly, the PA leadership has been virtually silent and generally
indifferent toward the grave assaults, which suggests that Mr. Arafat (Arafat is in fact
the PA and the PA is Arafat) is not terribly disturbed by the gangster-like acts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, he has yet to prove that he is concerned. In any case, the
flimsy denunciation of the attack on al-Masri, which came out from some PA
figures&#151;namely, al-Tayeb Abdul Rahim&#151;should not be considered a vindication of
the PA regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the fact that the PA has failed to arrest and punish the
perpetrators, which are believed to be identified with Musa Arafat&#151;a criminal thug
and relative of Arafat whose agents murdered the boy Wasim Al-Tarifi in Ramallah two years
ago&#151;suggests that the PA is only following the old adage &#147;kill &#145;em and walk
in his funeral.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, not only did the PA leadership resort to silence, indifference
and hypocritical condemnation, but the PA-controlled media, the entire Fatah movement and
even the Legislative Council itself, which is supposed to be answerable to the people and
not subservient to Yasser Arafat as it is now, all took a similar posture. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the fact that the assaults did not sound an alarm bell
throughout the autonomous enclaves is in itself a sufficient reason to be worried.
Needless to say, these incidents would have undoubtedly left no stone unturned had they
taken place in a country that respects itself and its people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest physical assault perpetrated by members of Arafat&#146;s thugs
on Abdul Jawad Saleh (a Legislative Council member whose only &#147;crime&#148; was to
call for financial transparency and the establishment of the rule of law) in Jericho
recently was not the first nor will it be the last of its kind.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two years ago, several councillors were physically attacked by Preventive
Security agents near Jerusalem and not even a disciplinary action was taken against the
perpetrators.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likewise, this time the PA sought to defend and cover up the attack on
Saleh, claiming he did not follow the instructions of visiting prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nor did the PA investigate the incident, because there is simply no
&#147;law&#148; that one can go by, and even if there was a law, the PA would very likely
not uphold it, since doing so would fetter the hands of the autocrat and those of the rest
of his despicable junta.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA must be made to understand that attacking a lawmaker is
unacceptable, repulsive and a red line that must not be allowed to be crossed again.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the Palestinian people must also be in a position to tell Arafat
what they should have told him a long time ago, that being that the security agencies
should be bridled and reined in, because nobody is above the law or else we will end up
cloning all the defunct police States in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the rest of
the third world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian people must also be made to understand that the ball is
ultimately in its court, not in Arafat&#146;s, because Arafat will be as despotic and
impetuous as we, the people, allow him to be. </p>
