<b>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Time to be serious</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the outbreak of the Aqsa uprising nearly a year ago, the Israeli
occupation army and paramilitary Jewish terrorists have murdered close to 700
Palestinians, a third of them minors and children. Jewish terror also left an estimated
25,000 Palestinians seriously injured and maimed, with several thousand suffering from
disabilities that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the Israeli army utterly destroyed hundreds of residential
homes as well as numerous public buildings throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And,
last but not least, the vandals of our time ruined tens of thousands of acres of
Palestinian farmland and olive groves and orchards, turning much of the previously green
Palestinian landscape into desert.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the criminal Zionists, with their lethal combination of a
virulent racist ideology and a potent military machine, continue to narrow Palestinian
horizons by making daily life for virtually all Palestinians unbearable. Indeed, the
11-month-old siege on Palestinian towns, villages, hamlets and refugee camps serves as a
gruesome testimony to Zionist savagery and brutality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the face of this overwhelming evil, the world has done very little
beyond the customary and routine statements calling on &quot;both sides&quot; to exercise
restraint, thus ignoring, rather scandalously, the stark moral gap between the aggressor
and the victim of aggression, the occupier and the victim of occupation, the rapist and
the victim of the rape.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The United States, the true evil empire of the world today, continued, in
characteristic brazenness, to actively support Israeli bellicosity and arrogance of power
by blaming the victims, the tormented Palestinians, for resisting their tormentors.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, a simple analysis of the American posture toward the current
showdown in Palestine suggests that the George W. Bush administration has in effect no
policy except perhaps telling both the rapist and the rape victim to &quot;work it out
between themselves.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Europe is not doing any better, as European envoys continued to come
and go, reiterating the same nice-sounding platitudes about the need to end the violence
and revert to the negotiating table. It is a language that Ariel Sharon, the certified war
criminal, holds in contempt, especially with George W. Bush at his beck and call.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for the Palestinian leadership, its management of the Israeli rampage
of murder, violence and terror against a surrounded and captive people, decimated by 33
years of sinister military occupation, has been a gigantic fiasco.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, from the first day of the current Zionist campaign, the PA has
been effectively repeating the same irksome demands for international protection and calls
on Arabs, Muslims, Christians and peace-loving peoples around the world to press and
pressurize Israel to stop her brutal onslaught. But to no avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even the unrelenting and desperate calls on Arab and Muslim masses to
rally in solidarity with their struggling Palestinian brethren have yielded virtually
nothing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, what should the Palestinian people and other living forces in the
Arab-Muslim world do to overcome, or at least neutralize, this overwhelming gloom?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First of all, the intifada must continue, however dear the sacrifices,
however painful the price, since it is our only and last remaining response to Israel's
policy of subjugation. Sharon, et. al, needless to say, offer us two choices: either to be
killed like meek sheep, or to become martyrs in martyrdom operations against the
oppressors. And we will not allow ourselves to be killed like meek sheep.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, for the sake of our children, and in order not to allow Sharon
and other Zionist criminals to enjoy the outcome of their blitz, we have no choice but to
meet death with death. Sadly, this is the only language the Jewish Nazis understand. If
their people don't get killed, not a Palestinian man, woman, child or leader will be
immune from their death squads and State terror.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With Israeli insolence narrowing our horizons, and with Arab impotence and
international indifference leaving us exposed to further Zionist brutality, it is no
secret that we have become a people with so little freedom and so little hope that
martyrdom operations seem our only hope for a better tomorrow.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And there is a crucial role for Arab and Islamic forces to play, each in
its own country and area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Real efforts, therefore, must be made to convince the Americans that the
only way to protect their interests throughout the Muslim world is not by patronizing the
Zionist regime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, we must break the vicious cycle whereby Israel manipulates the
U.S., the U.S. controls the regimes, and the regimes, in turn, enslave the masses and rob
them of their most fundamental human rights and civil liberties, which actually means that
we are being enslaved by the Zionists, though indirectly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Breaking this cycle is simple, and the way to do it is to follow the way
of Hizbullah and Hamas. In America, when there was still a semblance of political
morality, they used to say, &quot;Give me freedom or give me death.&quot; In our more
pressing Palestinian (and Arab) situation, it is martyrdom or struggle till victory.&nbsp;</p>
