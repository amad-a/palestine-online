<b>Settlements: An Introduction</b>
<p><img align="right" src="settle.jpg">
Since the signing of the Wye Agreement on 23 October 1998, the Israeli
authorities have given the green light to the construction of bypass
roads in the West Bank. Their purpose is to link the settlements to
each other and impose de-facto Israeli control and presence in order
to lay claim to these lands prior to the final status talks This
campaign of land grab, settlement expansion and building, and by-pass
road construction has been rapidly escalated.
<P>
The Israeli government has stepped up its plans to
implement a policy of quiet deportation and ethnic cleansing in what
has come to be known, in the case of Jerusalem, as the city's
'judaisation'. Israeli officials have publicly declared that these
plans are meant to expropriate the large part of Palestinian land.
<P>
The existence of Israeli settlements contravenes the Fourth Geneva
Convention which demands the occupier of foreign land to refrain from
undertaking any procedures meant to change the status quo of the
occupied territories, including the transfer of its civilians. 
<P>
The actions also contravene with UNSC resolutions and the bilateral
signed agreements. Such unilateral Israeli practices breach the Wye
Agreement. The provisions related to unilateral actions state the
following: "Recognising the necessity to create a positive
environment for negotiations, neither side shall initiate or take
any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip in accordance with the Interim Agreement." 
<P>
The Israeli Government, whether through the statements of Ministers
encouraging settlers to 'take over the hills in the West Bank', or
through official approval for the expansion of settlements, is
violating the general provisions and terms of the Wye River
Agreement. 
<P>
Furthermore, these procedures violate the Cairo Agreements of May
1994, which in the preamble reaffirm " their understanding that the
interim self-government arrangements, including the arrangements to
apply in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area contained in this
Agreement, are an integral part of the whole peace process and that
the negotiations on the permanent status will lead to the
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338." 
<P><img align="right" src="setprot.jpg">
It is clear that the unilateral actions taken by the Israeli
Government will not lead to the implementation of Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, and will not cause the agreement's
deadlines to be met, but will rather perpetuate the occupation. In
relation to the permanent status negotiations the agreement states:
"The two sides will immediately resume permanent status negotiations
on an accelerated basis and will make a determined effort to achieve
the mutual goal of reaching an agreement by May 4, 1999. The
negotiations will be continuous and without interruption. The US has
expressed its willingness to facilitate these negotiations." 
<P>
Not only do Israeli procedures violate the legitimate political
rights of the Palestinian people, they also take over their property,
threatening their security and life. The construction of bypass roads
will devour Palestinian agricultural land, the source of their pride
and living. Furthermore, the roads will necessitate the demolition of
hundreds of Palestinian houses and the dislocation of hundreds of
families. Israeli forces have been preventing residents from
cultivating the land adjacent to their houses. Many people have been
detained because of their attempts to cultivate their own land, and
water supplies to the neighbourhood have been cut off. 
<P>
Settlers have also been known to attack residents of the same
neighbourhood. This appears to be part of an orchestrated attempt to
threaten the Palestinian community in an effort to make way for
settlement expansion. 
<P>
The prohibitions stipulated in Wye did not stop Israel's Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon from calling on settlers to "take over the
hills of the West Bank before it is too late". A public statement of
this nature by a minister of the Israeli Government can only be
viewed as official encouragement to settlers to carry out unilateral
action in disregard of international law and the agreements signed by
their own government. Additional efforts must be undertaken 
immeidately to stop the violation of law and life.
