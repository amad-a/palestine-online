<blockquote>
<b>The Palestinians</b>
<p><img align="right" src="palestin.gif">
The Palestinians were born and lived in the Holy Land, the land of their fathers and forefathers, since time immemorial. They are not emigrees, who entered the country under the British bayonets. Likewise they are not aliens to the land, strangers to its people, or colonizers from all corners of the globe, who came to the country in an ocean of American financial assistance.
<p>
No. The are lawful citizens of Palestine, rooted to its soil, and deeply attached to its history. Their homes are their own. Their farms are their possession. Their orchards, they have planted themselves. Their mosques and churches, they have established with their fathers and grandfathers. Their towns and villages are their toil and, are the toil and the sweet of their ancestors. They have dispossessed none, and none they have robbed. They are the victims of the most degrading international robbery.
<p>
Public opinion in the West has only relatively recently accepted that the Palestinians have a case that deserves to be taken seriously. Even now, few people appreciate what the Palestinians have experienced, or how reduced their prospects are compared with what they have lost.
<p>It was easy to make the Palestinians pay for 2,000 years of persecution. The Palestinians, who have felt the enormous power of this vengeance, were not the historical oppressors of the Jews. They did not put Jews into ghettoes and did not force them to wear yellow stars. They did not plan holocausts. But they had one fault. They were weak and defenseless in the face of real military might, so they were the ideal victims for an abstract revenge...
