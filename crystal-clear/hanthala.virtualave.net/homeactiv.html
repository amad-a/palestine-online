<b>Campaign on Land Confiscation and House Demolition</b>
<p>
<a href="http://www.lawsociety.org">LAW</a> is starting a campaign to monitor Israeli policy regarding land and housing issues in the West Bank including Jerusalem.
<p>
The Israeli government has tried to control the development of 
Palestinian community through the demolition of houses. Palestinians 
are not allowed to build in approximately 60% of the West Bank, 40% 
of Gaza Strip and 87% of Jerusalem. It is almost impossible for 
Palestinians to obtain a building permit because of discriminatory 
building regulations. Palestinians who start to build without permits 
to house their families are then threatened with the demolition of 
their homes.
<p>
In addition Israel has cleared land, the uprooted trees and
destroyed crops belonging to Palestinians.  This policy has led to
the loss of income and economic hardship for the already
underdeveloped areas. 
<p>
Since 1967 Israel has also pursued a policy of land expropriation of
Palestinian land in the Occupied Territories.  So far, it is
estimated that 212 settlements have been built in the West Bank,
including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The houses located in
the settlements are designated for Jewish people only. By
establishing settlements Israel is creating irreversible facts on
the ground. The de facto annexation of large parts of the
territories presents the Palestinians with a 'fait accompli'
obstructing progress to a lasting peace.
<p>
The creation of bypass road is a consequential effect of settlement
construction. Bypass roads are built to enable settlers to literally
'bypass' Palestinian towns and villages and to connect Jewish
settlements to each other and to Israel proper. Currently, 12 new
'bypass' roads are being constructed in the West Bank, a network
that was not designed to serve the needs of Palestinian population. 
<p>
For the period covering January 1 to June 30 1999, LAW reported
10,024 dunums confiscated and 14,678 dunums levelled to build either
bypass roads or settlements. In addition 2,265 trees were uprooted
and 34 houses were demolished in the West Bank including East
Jerusalem this year. The aims of such policies have been to prevent
the growth and development of the Palestinian communities and
increase the number of Israeli settlements.
<p>
House demolition, tree uprooting, land confiscation and the
construction of settlements and 'bypass' road by Israel contravene
international law such as the IV Geneva Convention, the Hague
Regulations, the Oslo Accords and the Wye Agreement and are against
the letter and spirit of the peace process.
<p>
With this campaign <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org">LAW</a> wants to raise the awareness of international public on the issue of land and housing. We ask you to call for
Israel's respect of human rights and international. As individuals
you can help by writing or faxing to Prime Minister <a href="mailto:ebarak@parliament.gov.il">Ehud Barak</a> at
<a href="mailto:ebarak@parliament.gov.il">ebarak@parliament.gov.il</a>, +972-2-566-4838; President <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">Bill Clinton</a> at <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">president@whitehouse.gov</a>, +1-202-456-2461. You can also write or fax
your government and forward this flyers to others and to the media.
