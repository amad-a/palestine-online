<b>Water: Activism</b>
<p><img align="right" src="water2.jpg">
Israel announced recently a huge reduction of water quantities as a result of the drought this year. This announcement caused a real threat among Palestinians due to the fact that Israel is still in full control of  almost 90% of Water Resources of the West Bank. Moreover, there is no final agreement between Israel and Palestine on water.  This situation deepens the Palestinian fear of reducing the amounts supplied to them either from sources within the West Bank or from the Israeli water system.  This fear increased especially after the announcement of reducing water for Jordan in the time that the two countries have signed a final agreement. Meanwhile, the Palestinian case there is no final agreement and therefore, no limitation on any steps taken by Israel in this regard.
<p>
It is however, good to mention that the current quantities available for Palestinian use from local sources in the West Bank (wells and springs) doesn't exceed 125 mcm/year.  This amount is not sufficient to meet Palestinian total demand which is estimated at nearly 209-220 year in the West Bank.  However, the situation is more acute in Gaza strip. The current water use is nearly 110 mcm/year.  The demand is expected to be nearly 132-158 mcm/year.  This quantity can no longer be sustained from sources within Gaza given that the current water use of 110 mcm/year already over pumps the aquifer by nearly 50% of its replenishment capacity.  This in turn has deteriorated the quality of he aquifer and led to saline water intrusion. The current level of salinity (TDS) in the southern Part of Gaza exceeds 3000 mg/L in the time that the recommended WHO level is 1000 mg/L.  The situation will deteriorate further under the drought of the current year.  Water quality deterioration will increase as a result of low rainfall recharge as well as pumping, even at the current level, from the aquifer.
<p>
It is believed that the current year is an exceptionally dry year and both Palestinians and Israeli's facing a water shortage.  Therefore, it will be unfair and unacceptable by Palestinian to be left a lone in facing the drought while their neighbor's enjoying water normally. In addition, Palestinian communities seeing their settlers enjoying their swimming pools. The time of crisis is the real test of parties well in living together peacefully and cooperatively.  It is the time to treat people equally and to provide them with this very basic human right.  It is also the real time to think seriously about the wrong practices currently in use. This year's drought can no longer sustain further production of flowers for export while tens of thousands of Palestinians facing thirst, their cattle's and herds-the main income source for them is also under a real threat. We at PHG feels the importance of cooperation among all concerned government and non government institutions in Palestine and also extents our hand to all Israel's.  NGO's and Israeli public who believes in peace and cooperation to cooperate in facing this serious situation.
<p>
We also suggest some practical aspects and immediate actions to be taken immediately.  Such actions might include, but not limited to the following:-
<p>
<ol>
<li>Formulate an emergency center equipped with water tankers and other necessary tools for purification to respond to water disaster that might happens both in the West Bank and Gaza.  The center must also be linked with a group health us well as water professionals.</li>
<p>
<li>Conduct a national and even regional public awareness campaigns to stress the importance of water use efficiency and water conservation.  It is necessary here to stress the following:</li>
<p>
<ol>
<li>adopting all water saving appliances and fixtures that help reduce water use while gives the same results in house and outdoors.</li>
<p>
<li>Work with the community, especially women and children, to insure changing their water use practices and behavior.</li>
<p>
<li>Impose restrictions on all unnecessary water usage's, such as car wash and other uses that requires large fresh water quantities.</li>
<p>
<li>Adopt a strategy whereby, gray water and marginal water is used in low sensitive areas for agriculture and other non domestic purposes.</li>
</ol>
<li>Lobby with Palestinian Government as well as legislative council to insure taking necessary regulatory measures related to water use, conservation, disposal and re-use.</li>
<p>
<li>Lobby with international and with Israeli NGO's to take precautionary measures toward the water quantities for Palestinians.</li>
<p>
<li>Establish an emergency trust fund to combat drought and to respond to the needs whenever they a rise in the West Bank and Gaza.</li>
</ol>
