<b>Protest against Kappa's opening factory in Jewish Colony in Occupied Palestine</b>
<p>
<img align="right" src="kappa.jpg">
The Italian sportwear concern Kappa will establish a production system for its sportwear at the Jewish colony of Barkan in occupied Palestine. The concern is represented in Israel by Omini Import & Marketing Ltd. of the Fishman Group. Tankredi Vitale, Kappa's Chief Designer and its Head of International Production, has been in Israel to conduct negotiations with Shlomo Drori, one of the owners of Matperat Barkan (Barkan Sewing Workshop Ltd.). They aim at establishing a joint production system. The sportwear items produced  at the Barkan Industrial Zone are to be marketed in both Israel and Europe under the brand name Kappa. The Kappa Concern belongs to the Italian Basic Group, itself owned by U.B.S. and by Benetton. 
<P>
Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) are illegal, unjust, and are an obstacle to peace. Successive Israeli governments, since 1948, have used the concept of Palestine being a "land without people" in order to justify continuous and illegal settlement expansion in the OPT since 1967. The Israeli government's settlement construction program has continued even after the Oslo Agreements. The existence of Israeli settlements contravenes the Fourth Geneva Convention which demands the occupier of foreign land to refrain from undertaking any procedures meant to change the status quo of the occupied territories, including the transfer of its civilians.
<P>
Israeli and international corporations are violating human rights by operating in Israeli settlements build on confiscated Palestinian land. The establishment of permanent Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) contravene international (humanitarian) law. According to that law, an occupying power is prohibited from transferring population from its territory it occupies, and from performing any act that is not intended to benefit the local population. In addition, international law prohibits creating permanent change not intended for the benefit of that population. In their settlement policy, the various Israeli governments have violated international law, in general, and international agreements to which Israel is a party, in particular. Israel continues to expropriate additional Palestinian lands, both private and public, to expand settlements, and to build bypass roads.
<P>
There is no distinction between the public and private spheres for those involved in Israel's settlement policy. In the nexus of the economic and political spheres, a profitable, symbiotic relationship for Israeli corporations operating in Israeli settlements, particularly with the Israeli military authority has been fostered. Israeli corporations operating in Israeli settlements are perpetrators of human rights violations and should be held accountable for this.
<P>
The concept of holding businesses accountable for human rights violations has become an increasingly accepted notion since World War II. The spectrum of accountability mechanisms has ranged from trials and tribunals, based on both national and international human rights law to, in recent decades, a proliferation of codes of conduct. At one extreme are judicial proceedings, including criminal prosecutions, and civil actions for monetary compensation. At the other end are the codes of conduct, characterised by voluntary adherence although some include sanctions and enforcement mechanisms. There is increasing pressure for these codes to conform with international legal instruments. The international condemnations of Israeli settlements over decades as well as other human rights instruments overlap to provide norms and standards which govern economic life.
<P>
With the establishment of a production system for its sportwear at the Israeli settlement of Barkan in the Occupied Palestinian Territories Kappa will become part of these violations, which are described according to international law as warcrimes. By establishing a factory on property illegally seized for the exclusive use by Israeli settlers, Kappa sends us the message that the corporation has no respect for international law. 
<P>
Does Kappa intend to endorse the policies of the Israeli settler movement whose aim is to confiscate as much land as possible in order to prevent the self-determination of Palestinians living in the area? Kappa shouldn't compromise on moral principles. We hope that Kappa will consider its decisions. Hanthala Palestine as well as other networks and Arab-American organisations called its supporters to write letters, call, fax and email Kappa as well as Benneton to show their concern with its plans.
