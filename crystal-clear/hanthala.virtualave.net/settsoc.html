<b>Settlements: The Socio-Economic Impact</b>
<p><img align="right" src="settle.jpg">
The impact of Israeli settlement and settlers on Palestinian land and water resources is one
element in a broad relationship of inequality and dependency established and promoted by the
occupation during the last quarter century. While there have been anecdotal enquiries into
specific examples of this phenomena--for example, Palestinian construction labor at an Israeli
settlement or the effects on an adjacent Palestinian community of sewage produced by a
settlement--there have been no studies that focus on the overall economic effects of settlements
themselves, singly or collectively, on Palestinians. Nevertheless, some data is available that
offers a broad insight into the nature and scale of the impact of settlements on Palestinian land
and water resources.
<P>
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is essentially a contest for control of the region's
resources, principally land and water. To the extent that these assets are used by one
antagonist, occupation has been structured so that the other loses.
<P>
Settlements have long represented an Israeli intention to
remain permanently on the land and to control its destiny,
necessarily at the expense of Palestinians. Without
settlements, as Israelis have long acknowledged, they
would be merely an "occupying" army. The implantation of
civilian Israeli colonies is, therefore, the primary obstacle to
Palestinian self-determination.
<P>
All Israeli settlements in the West Bank are currently
located in Area C, which is under exclusive Israeli control
and which comprises 72 percent of the West Bank. Israel
similarly controls approximately 15 percent of the Gaza
Strip. In the Golan Heights, the Syrian population of 17,000
is clustered into five small villages abutting the Syrian-Lebanese border. The 32 Israeli
settlements control 80 percent of the plateau. One-quarter of the entire Golan--315,000
dunams--is grazing land controlled by‚ ‚settlers.
<P>
Assessing the precise effect of the loss and reallocation of Palestinian lands to Israeli
settlements is difficult. The World Bank, in a draft of its September 1993 study, "Developing the
Occupied Territories--An Investment in Peace," notes:
<P>
<blockquote><font size=2><i>
     Confiscation of Palestinian land has enabled Israel to proceed with the construction of settlements
     and related structures in various areas of the West Bank that were traditionally considered to be
     wilderness zones. Most important among these are the eastern slopes and the central part of the
     West Bank which once housed a variety of wildlife and provided a winter grazing ground for livestock
     and recreation for the local population. . . . Similarly, building agricultural settlements in the Jordan
     Valley has gradually deprived the Palestinian inhabitants of these areas of their richest soils and
     water wells. A similar situation has developed in the Gaza Strip where settlements have encroached
     upon fertile inland and coastal areas. The Israeli settlement program was not accompanied by
     adequate and proper environmental considerations. None of the settlements have developed sewage
     treatment plants. Sewage is often allowed to run into valleys even if a neighboring [Palestinian]
     village is threatened. The sewage system of the settlements on the eastern hills and slopes north of
     Jerusalem has contaminated fresh water supplies for drinking and irrigation of Palestinian areas up
     to Jericho.</i></font></blockquote>
