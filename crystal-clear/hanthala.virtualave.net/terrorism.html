<b>The Truth About Terrorism</b> by <a href="http://www.abunimah.org">Ali Abunimah</a>
<p><img align="right" src="terror.gif">
December 22, 1999
<P>
Are the recent warnings about the threat of terrorism a reasonable
precaution by the government to a real and present danger, or are the
media and government once again promoting anti-Muslim and anti-Arab
hysteria under the guise of vigilance against terrorism? Whatever the
case, the arrest of an Algerian man last week, allegedly for trying to
enter the United States from Canada with bomb-making materials, has set
off yet another free for all of media speculation about vicious Muslim
plots to blow up the United States on the eve of the millennium.  
<P>
To many people this hysteria appears to be nothing more than a reasonable
response to a frightening possibility. But if we examine the US
government's own data about terrorism, it is a completely unjustified
overreaction which puts at risk all of our civil liberties and freedoms,
but especially those of Arab and Muslim Americans who are, despite all the
lessons of Oklahoma City, TWA 800 and other incidents, still the first to
fall under suspicion and to be victimized by repressive measures such as
the use of secret evidence and passenger profiling.
<P>
So, is all the focus on the threat of "Islamic" terrorism justified and
based in fact?
<P>
To put the issue in perspective, I examined the State Department's own
annual report, <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/terrorism/1998Report/1998index.html">"Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1998"</a>.
<P>
Below I have summarized some facts from the report about events which the
State Department defines as international terrorist incidents (in other
words excluding domestic terrorism by purely US-based groups, such as
anti-abortion groups). The report uses the following definitions:
<P>
"The term "terrorism" means premeditated, politically motivated violence
perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or
clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.  The term
"international terrorism" means terrorism involving citizens or the
territory of more than one country.  The term "terrorist group" means any
group practicing, or that has significant subgroups that practice,
international terrorism."
<P>
1) <font size=2><b>TERRORISM WORLDWIDE IS DECREASING SIGNIFICANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY</b></font>
<P>
There has been a significant and consistent downward trend in
international terrorist incidents in the period 1979-1998.
<P>
In 1998, the number of international terrorist incidents, at 273, was the
lowest ever in the period, and the annual number has shown a consistent
downward trend since it reached a peak of 666 in 1987.
<P>
2) <font size=2><b>THE VAST MAJORITY OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST INCIDENTS ARE NOT RELATED
TO THE MIDDLE EAST, MUSLIM "EXTREMISTS" OR ARABS</b></font>
<P>
Since 1995, Latin America has consistently had the highest annual number
of international terrorist incidents of any region, followed by Western
Europe. In 1998 there were 110 attacks in Latin America, 48 in Western
Europe and 31 in the Middle East. There were 21 in Africa and zero in
North America.
<P>
The incidents in Latin America are primarily connected to conflicts in
Colombia and Peru, while the vast majority of incidents in Europe are,
according to the State Department, attributable to Basque separatists in
Spain, the conflict in Northern Ireland, the Kurdish movement in Turkey
and various anarchist groups in Greece. Middle East or "Islamic" terrorism
was not a significant factor in either region.
<P>
In terms of casualties (deaths+injuries), the highest number have
consistently been in Asia since 1993. In 1998 there were over 5,000 in
Africa, 635 in Asia, 405 in Western Europe, 68 in the Middle East and zero
in North America.
<P>
3) <font size=2><b>EIGHTY PERCENT OF ATTACKS  AGAINST UNITED STATES TARGETS ARE IN LATIN
AMERICA</b></font>
<P>
Consistently, the vast majority of events defined by the State Department
as "anti-US attacks" occur in Latin America.  In 1998, there was a total
of 111 anti-US attacks. Eighty seven were in Latin America, 13 in Western
Europe, 5 in the Middle East and 3 each in Africa and Eurasia.
<P>
By far the most common targets of terrorists are businesses. Attacks on
diplomats, military or government installations are relatively rare.
<P>
The total number of US fatalities from these attacks in 1998 was 12, all
related to the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
<P>
4) <font size=2><b>VERY FEW AMERICANS ARE KILLED BY TERRORISTS</b></font>
<P>
Here are the numbers for the total U.S. Citizen Casualties Caused by
International Attacks, 1993-98. Note that the figures show no upward
trend. 
<P>
1993	7
<br>1994	6
<br>1995	10
<br>1996	25
<br>1997	6
<br>1998	12
<P>
(The 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania caused a large
number of non-US casualties in addition to the US victims).
<P>
These numbers suggest that terrorism is a relatively insignificant cause
of death and injury to Americans compared with other forms of violence.
For example, according to the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence,
14 children are killed EVERY DAY in the United States by handguns. In the
State of Illinois alone, 320 are killed each year (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1997). 
<P>
5) <font size=2><b>MIDDLE EAST VIOLENCE IS RELATED TO LOCAL POLITICAL CONFLICTS, NOT
"HATRED OF THE WEST"</b></font>
<P>
Although the level of international terrorist events in the Middle East
has been lower than in other parts of the world, such violence as occurs
is principally related to local political conflicts, not to generalized
"hatred of the West" as often portrayed in the media. The numbers and
descriptions of patterns of violence in the Middle East suggest that as in
other regions like Northern Ireland, violence diminishes when broad-based
political processes or solutions are set in motion. The State Department
report acknowledges that the downward trend in terrorism "reflects the
improved political climate that has diminished terrorist activity in
recent years in various parts of the world."
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>
There is a complete disparity between the facts about international
terrorism as presented by the government on the one hand, and the media,
official and popular response to the issue on the other. There is no
objective connection between the frequency of terrorist attacks
originating from and occurring in the Middle East, and the amount of
attention that such attacks receive. President Clinton and other
government officials have repeatedly defined terrorism as one of the
greatest threats facing the world.
<P>
There is little or no media attention to the facts about terrorism, as
reported by the government, and a generalized willingness to continue to
blame and speculate about the Middle East as a principal purveyor of
violence. This situation continues to hurt and marginalize Arab and Muslim
citizens of the United States, and to distort public perceptions about the
Middle East, a region in which US taxpayers are being asked to invest a
lot of money, often in the name of "security."
<P>
Each and every life lost due to terrorism is one too many, and of course
there must be vigilance against terrorism, and support for genuine efforts
to prevent it. But clearly other policy agendas, totally unrelated to
public security, are being served by the obsessive focus on Middle East
terrorism, when the facts suggest a more balanced approach would be
appropriate.
