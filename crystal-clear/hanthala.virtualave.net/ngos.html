<b>SELF-DETERMINATION AS A CRUCIAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN PALESTINE</b>
<P><img align="right" src="intern.gif">
<font size=2><b>A CALL ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NGOs</b></font>
<p>
On March 25, 1999 the <a href="http://europa.eu.int/index-en.htm">European Union</a> issued the <a href="http://europa.eu.int/council/off/conclu/mar99_en.htm">Berlin Declaration</a> in which
it reaffirmed its continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to
self-determination including the option of a state and looks forward to the
early fulfillment of this right. It stressed that this right is not subject
to any veto. The <a href="http://europa.eu.int/index-en.htm">European Union</a> additionally declared "its readiness to
consider the recognition of a Palestinian State in due course." At this
point in time there should be a refocus on the internationalisation of the
Question of Palestine. 
<P>
The <a href="http://www.bgu.ac.il/chcenter/dox/interim.html">Oslo Accords</a> have served to isolate the Question from the international
community, and has provided an opportunity for foreign governments to be
more openn in their support of Israel (recently trade relations are
established between Israel and a number of Asian states). Moreover, there
has also been a regional isolation, with neighbouring Arab states rushing
to sign agreements with Israel in order to secure their own economic and
development interests. This international and regional isolation is forcing
the Question of Palestine into a local isolated issue, of concern to Israel
and the Palestinian Authority and their "honest broker" the US, but of less
concern to the outside world. This isolation makes protecting human rights
more and more difficult.
<P>
There is a reluctance on the part of most governments to pressure both
parties, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, to comply with human rights
covenants and international law has been bypassed by reference to the
signed agreements, instead to various international covenants, <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/res.htm">UN
resolutions</a>, or even the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.
Additionally, there is another isolation, that of international human
rights organisations. For example, there is the deference of the
<a href="http://www.ifrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (<a href="http://www.ifrc.org/">ICRC</a>), which has been reluctant
to take a view on the Oslo process in relation to the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva
Convention</a>. 
<P>
Additionally, groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> which is primarily
concerned with freedom from torture, liberty of the person and trial by due
process, monitors the activities of the Palestinian Authority and
criticises legitimately the human rights record of the Palestinian
Authority, but it fails to link such violations to the overall Israeli
occupation. If the powers of the Palestinian Authority are viewed as having
been delegated by Israel, the question of the responsibilities of the
Palestinian Authority are subsumed under that of the responsibilities of
Israel. To the extent that the Palestinian Authority in fact remains
subservient to the will of the Occupying Power, and as long as the
occupation continues, Israel should continue to be held accountable by the
humanitarian law obligations of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>.
<P>
However, human rights organisations continue to observe continues human
rights violations both committed by Israel as by the Palestinian Authority.
For example, recently Israel detained 16 Palestinian children. During
interrogation, two of the children were beaten and the others were
threatened with physical abuse, and confessions were extracted from the
arrested children. These arrest constitute clear violations of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">UDHR</a>,
the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">ICCPR</a>, the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>, the UN <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> and even violations of the Oslo Agreements which state that "Israel and the Palestinians shall exercise their powers and
responsibilities...with due regard to internationally accepted norms and
principles of human rights and the rule of law" (Art 14 <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/qpal/docs/A_49_180.htm">Gaza-Jericho
Accord</a>; Art 19 <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/qpal/docs/A_51_889.htm">Interim Agreement</a> "<a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/qpal/docs/A_51_889.htm">Oslo II</a>").
<P>
The <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> noted that self-determination was a crucial
principle of collective human rights (the Committee's interpretation of art
1 of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">ICCPR</a>). In its general comment on Self-Determination adopted in
1984, the Human Rights Committee emphasised that the realisation of the
right of self-determination "was an essential condition for the effective
guarantee and observance of individual human rights". 
<P>
The right to <a href="http://www.palestine-un.org/res/54_7.html">self-determination</a> can not be given away, being a
non-negotiable human right recognised in order to enhance economic, social,
cultural, political and civil rights. Autonomy is a concept repugnant to
the exercise of the right of self-determination of peoples. 
<P>
The principle of self-determination of peoples was expressly included in the 
<a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/ch-cont.htm">UN Charter</a>, by article 1(2). The Palestinians had not acquired their
independent nationhood at the conclusion of the British Mandate and the
transfer of the Question of Palestine to the UN in 1948. Their right to
self-determination had not been abrogated or dissolved at that time. On the
contrary, it became active, in possession, and awaits implementation. The
Oslo Accords can never derogate from the right to self-determination which
asserts the right of the Palestinian people to freely decide on their own
political, economic, social and cultural status. <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/45996cc3259e1c9c052567270057ac6f/e7c4b66c913ec0dc852560de006e8f1b?OpenDocument">UNGA 2767</a> adopted on 8
December 1970 "recognises that the people of Palestine are entitled to
equal rights and self-determination in accordance with the Charter of the
UN." This was reaffirmed more strongly in UNGA 2787 of 6 December 1971. 
<P>
Furthering this, it is highly doubtful whether any claim by Israel to fill
the "vacuum" in territorial sovereignty over the "territories" could be
supported by international law. The series of UN resolutions is
inconsistent with recognition of any such claim. The juxtaposition of the
right of self-determination of the Palestinians residing in the occupied
Palestine and Israel's occupation would seem to be a legal question that
might well be referred to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> by the UNGA
for any advisory opinion under article 96(1) of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/ch-cont.htm">UN</a> Charter. This
demands a two-thirds majority vote. At the same time, the UNGA might move
to recommend a referendum in Palestine, before the determination of the
right of self-determination is considered by the court, together with other
claims to the territories. 
<P><img align="right" src="hr_eng.gif">
It is in regard to such matters that the return of Palestinian refugees and
the existence of large numbers of Jewish colonies in occupied Palestine
becomes critical. The existence of large numbers of Palestinian refugees
impedes the exercise of the Palestinian people's right to
self-determination. The right of self-determination is seriously impaired
if the majority of the people concerned are unable to return to their homes
from which they were forced to fled. Any proposed referendum should include
the Palestinian refugees in neighbouring Arab states. The Court's advisory
opinion might well be that the Jewish colonies are not lawfully
established. It might be contended before the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> that the existence of such Jewish colonies assumes an assertion of
Israeli sovereignty which is the very question in dispute. The juridical
status of the territories occupied by Israel, and its rights therein, might
well be a legal question for the Court's advisory opinion.
<P>
Moreover, the Palestinians are considered to have the right to
self-determination, that is treated as having an accepted place in
contemporary international law, in the two UN Covenants on Human Rights of
1966, by the UNGA and, more cautiously, by the International Court of
Justice (the South-West Africa Case 1971; Western Sahara Case 1975). The
language and the reasoning of the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> in its
advisory opinions show that it considers that there is a legal right to
self-determination. It would not be easy to convince any international
tribunal seeking to apply international law that the Palestinians in
Palestine and the Palestinian refugees outside Palestine are precluded from
the right to self-determination. 
<P>
The unique nature of the West Bank and Gaza situation is Israel's
occupation and the question of how it is to be juxtaposted with the
Palestinian right of self-determination. That is where the right of
self-defence is considered. Such a right is not identical with state's
security. Security is a political and military interest which Israel has in
common with all other states. It is the reason advanced for Israel's
refusal to withdraw from occupied Palestine. Self-defence and security are
not identical, either in nature or content. It is not a claim that Israel
is exercising its inherent legal right of self-defence by its continued
occupation of Palestine. Such a claim would not correspond with the facts
of the present situation. 
<P>
The continued occupation by Israel is not proportionate to the threat to
it. The response of Israel is excessive and the threat not immediate. The
present Israeli response of force, i.e. by remaining in occupied Palestine,
would require to be justified, in fact and in law. Israel's reliance upon
its "security" is an attempt to equate a political aspiration with a legal
right. A belligerent occupation which rests solely on the "security" of
Israel cannot be considered to oust the legal right of self-determination
of the Palestinian people. Security may be a political interest and
bargaining counter, but it is not a legal basis for Israel's continued
occupation of Palestine.
<P>
Given this situation the following options are available in which NGOs and
human rights groups and networks could play an important role. According to
international covenants, states may invite a state to accede to the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> and on <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">Civil
and Political Rights</a>. Over 120 states have already recognised the State of
Palestine (since 1988); and NGOs might seek to convince member states in
the General Assembly that they invite Palestine to accede to the
international covenants on human rights. There is no possibility of a veto
because the Security Council has nothing to do with it. 
<P>
If 120 states invite Palestine to accede to the international covenants on
human rights, you have a number of very important results. First and
foremost, Palestine recognises unambiguously the importance of human
rights; secondly, you have an indication that over 120 states take their
recognition of Palestine as a state seriously. It might even open the door
to Palestine to become a full member of the UN. This is important since the
international community can then demonstrate that it is not simply up to
the discretion of Israel to decide the final result of the settlement, nor
is it for Israel to act as if Palestine can only continue as a autonomous
entity within the de facto sovereignty of Israel. That ambiguity would be
removed. Should there be any ambiguity within the UN with regard to this
solution, the UN General Assembly can easily ask for an advisory opinion
from the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> and this court can then give its
legal opinion on the present legal status of Palestine.
<P>
The responsibility of the UN General Assembly which has stressed repeatedly
the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people (see also the
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/council/off/conclu/mar99_en.htm">Berlin Declaration</a> cited above), and the significance of UN resolution <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/45996cc3259e1c9c052567270057ac6f/59210ce6d04aef61852560c3005da209?OpenDocument">242</a>
and <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/be25c7c81949e71a052567270057c82b/7fb7c26fcbe80a31852560c50065f878?OpenDocument">338</a> (note that art 1 of the Declaration of Principles stated that
negotiations on the permanent status will lead to the implementation of
UNSCR <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/45996cc3259e1c9c052567270057ac6f/59210ce6d04aef61852560c3005da209?OpenDocument">242</a> and <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/be25c7c81949e71a052567270057c82b/7fb7c26fcbe80a31852560c50065f878?OpenDocument">338</a>). If there were a request by 120 states according to whom
Palestine is already a state (since otherwise they would not have
recognised it), then there would be no reason why these 120 states with a
majority in the UN General Assembly, not facing the problem of a US veto,
could not ask the Secretary-General Assembly to take steps asking for an
advisory opinion. 
<P>
This is a call for local, regional and international NGOs that have
<a href="http://www.hri.ca/uninfo/hrbodies/ecosoc/res31.shtml">consultative status</a> in meetings of UN bodies to convince member states in
the General Assembly that they invite Palestine to accede to the
international covenants on human rights. These bodies are various
committees entrusted with the monitoring of human rights treaties (<a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/hrc.htm">the
Human Rights Committee</a>; the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cescr.htm">Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights</a>; the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cerd.htm">Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a>; the
<a href="Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/cat.htm">the Committee
against Torture</a>; and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/crc.htm">Committee on the Rights of the Child</a>) in addition
to the Working Groups of the UN Commission. 
<P>
Those <a href="http://www.hri.ca/uninfo/hrbodies/ecosoc/res31.shtml">NGOs</a> in <a href="http://www.hri.ca/uninfo/hrbodies/ecosoc/res31.shtml">consultative status</a> with <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/ecosoc/document.htm">ECOSOC</a> may submit written and oral
statements related to agenda items. NGOs can also lobby on proposed
resolutions. Often parallel meetings with NGOs and diplomats are convened
to discuss action by the Commission on specific countries. Meetings with
Special Rapporteurs on countries can be organised by all NGOs and written
information can be submitted to the Rapporteurs and Working Groups.
Although active participation in the sessions of the Commission is
restricted to NGOs with consultative status, the special procedures of the
Commission (special rapporteurs e.g.) can be used by organisations and
groups concerned. This is a call for all organisations that like to see
human rights being respected in Palestine to use their abilities and
opportunities and to seek the full compliance to human rights standards by
inviting Palestine to accede to the international covenants on human rights.
