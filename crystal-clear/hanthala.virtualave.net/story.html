<b>The story never ends</b>
<p><img align="right" src="quds2.jpg">
In September 1993 when Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Agreement in
Washington, I thought that a new era would begin in the Middle East. In
Nablus, the largest city in the West Bank (not counting occupied East
Jerusalem) people were hopeful. People were celebrating in the streets
and singing national songs. They thought that the historical conflict
between Israelis and Palestinians was coming to its end and that a
better future was coming from the horizon. 
<p>
When I saw these people celebrating, I was thinking…is it possible to
live without an enemy ? I thought it was difficult to live without
something to fight for .I thought my life would be use- less without
having an enemy, it encourages you to think; to be active; to discover
yourself, your abilities and your fellowmen. It creates your
personality. 
<p>
But a few days later I realized that it was more ink on paper and even
on paper, the Oslo Agreements were bad for the Palestinians and good for
the Israelis to the extent that it preserves Israeli domination in
Palestine and the Middle East. I realized that we had to guarantee
Israeli security , but how can an occupied people guarantee the security
of their occupiers? We were fighting for our freedom and our independent
state but I realized that we will soon find our selves in microscopical
cantons. This agreement divided our land into three parts: A, B, and C.
Each part has its own specific laws, for example, you cannot search for
water in A-area without taking a permission from Israel and they of
course will never give it. 
<p>
Meanwhile, Israel continues building Jewish colonies on our lands, since
signing the Oslo agreements even more than ever before. The palestine
economy declined after the signing of the agreements instead of growing
as was promised to us. Unemployment doubled because of the Israeli
closure policy in which they forbid Palestinian workers to enter Israel
to work. 
<p>
They also promised us to develop our own factories to keep our market
open for their goods. Some closures were temporarily, sometimes between
cities and its villages, which prevented us to travel from are place to
the other. Gaza has been closed since 1993 and Jerusalem even before
that. For me as a Palestinian from the West Bank it is more easily to
visit Europe or the US than to travel from the West Bank to Gaza. 
<p>
Many students from Gaza who study at my university in Birzeit couldn't
visit their families, since they attended the university. Two students
from Gaza couldn't come back to the West Bank to attend the university.
So they went to Egypt and they took a flight from Cairo to Tel-Aviv and
from there they went illegally to the university in Birzeit. 
<p>
I thought that the signing of the Oslo Agreement meant no more
bloodshed. But two months after the signing of the agreement, Jewish
colonists killed three Palestinians in Turkumia and Hebron. On 25
February 1994, a Jewish colonist opened fire on praying Palestinians in
the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron under the protection of Israeli soldiers,
killing 29 Palestinians and injuring 88 others. During the
demonstrations, in the aftermath of this massacre, Israeli soldiers shot
and killed 28 more Palestinians. In September 1996, Israeli soldiers
shot and killed 65 Palestinians and injured 1600 in various Palestinian
cities. Cobra helicopters were used and many journalists and members of
medical teams were among the victims. Three months ago, Israeli soldiers
killed 3 Palestinian workers and injured 17 others near the checkpoint.
And only one month ago, Israeli soldiers killed 5 Palestinians and
injured hundred during the peaceful marches in commemoration of the
anniversary of the Nakba (the catastrophe). 
<p>
Here I mentioned some massacres which happened after Israel and the PLO
agreed to be partners in peace. These massacres happened in the period
of the peace process. How would it have been without the peace process?
