<b>INTIMIDATION, THREATS CONTINUE IN PA AREAS</b><img align="right" src="express.gif">
<P>
December 11, 1999
<P>
Palestinian human rights worker Hanan Elmasu was injured today when unidentified assailants attacked her outside her home in Ramallah. A <a href="http://www.birzeit.edu/bzunews/1999/Dec/11.html">press release</a> from <a href="http://www.birzeit.edu">BirZeit University</a>, where Elmasu directs the <a href="http://www.birzeit.edu/hrap/index.html">Human Rights Action Project</a> stated: 
<P>
"The attack came at approximately 2:30 AM on December 11 when a stone was hurled through Hanan Elmasu's Ramallah residence. When she went outside to check, she was hit in the head by another stone;  she passed out from the blow for several hours. The first stone was wrapped in a piece of paper containing portions of a statement initiated  by Palestinian intellectuals abroad expressing their concern at violations of freedom of expression in Palestine.  A warning directed at Hanan was written in poor English." 
<P>
This attack comes at a time when the Palestinian Authority is itself cracking down on citizens who call for democracy and respect for human rights. Eight of the signatories of the November 27 statement condemning corruption by the Palestinian Authority remain in detention. A Palestinian legislator, Muawiya Masri was attacked by three hooded assailants and shot in the leg outside his Nablus home on December 2, after he had been denounced by the Palestinian Authority for signing the November 27 statement. 
<P>
These alarming incidents demonstrate the continued danger to Palestinian society from the total absence of democracy and safeguards for human rights.
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians and others, inside and outside Palestine have continued to sign onto a statement demanding the immediate release of the prisoners. More than 1,200 have signed the statement on the web, while nearly five hundred others have signed on in Palestine.
<P>
The statement and the full list of signatories to date is attached below. <a href="http://hanthala2.virtualave.net"><font size=2><b>CLICK HERE</a></b></font> or <a href="http://palestine.jumppolitics.com/"><font size=2><b>HERE</a></b></font> to add your name to the petition.

<B>STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINE SIGNATORIES</b>
<P>
We, the undersigned, condemn in the strongest terms the arrests by the Palestinian Authority of Palestinian citizens, signatories of a statement expressing their alarm about corruption in the Palestinian Authority, and the failure of the Oslo Accords to secure the minimum of the Palestinian people's rights. Those arrested should be released immediately, and all proceedings against the signatories should be halted immediately. 
<P>
The arrests are a totally unjustifiable attack on the freedom of expression, which should be guaranteed to every person. While carrying out these arrests, the Palestinian Authority is using the mantle of nationalism and the language of unity to stifle legitimate and necessary criticism and debate. Such repressive measures only harm the Palestinian people, and help their enemies, who point to the lack of democracy as evidence that Palestinians are incapable of governing themselves, and to the abuse of human rights by the Authority as an excuse for their own abuses. 
<P>
The statement rightly argues that continued widespread corruption and abuse of power threaten to stifle Palestinian civil society from within. It correctly notes that the agreements so far signed with Israel have utterly failed to secure Palestinian rights or to stop the continued assault on the Palestinian people from without. 
<P>
We affirm in conclusion that Palestinian national aspirations cannot be achieved in the absence of a fully democratic and open political system and that no agreements signed with Israel will be legitimate unless they represent a genuine, broad-based national consensus. Hence, new free and fair elections are an urgent requirement.
