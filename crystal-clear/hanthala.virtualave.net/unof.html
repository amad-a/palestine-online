<B>HANTHALA PALESTINE CALLS FOR THE RELEASE OF PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE IN JORDAN</B>
<P>
December 10, 2000
<P>
In an attempt to quell solidarity protests with the Intifida, a number of Arab governments, including those of Egypt, Jordan and Syria, have placed severe restrictions on the freedom of expression and association of their citizens.  
<P>
In particular, the Jordanian government has introduced and applied measures that are in direct violation of its constitution and human rights conventions to which it is a signatory. It has arrested and continues to persecute many of its citizens.
<P>
In direct violation of article 15 of the Jordanian Constitution and various human rights conventions to which it is a signatory, the Jordanian government announced that all solidarity demonstrations and marches were suspended.  Jordanian security forces have also proceeded to detain and persecute Jordanian citizens deemed to be involved in the demonstrations.
<P>
Violence by Jordanian security forces was used in the dispersal of demonstrations in front of Jordan University on  October 4, in al Rabiyeh (near the Israeli Embassy) on 6 and 13 October, during the Right to Return March on 24 October, and in the refugee camp of al Baqa'a. In this refugee camp, security forces used live bullets resulting in the death of one Palestinian refugee and injury of many others.
<P>
Demonstrators were typically drowned in tear gas, then overwhelmed with armored vehicles.  Anti-riot troops used clubs and physical force to strike down demonstrators including women and children. Many demonstrators were arrested, maltreated, threatened, beaten, and then released.
<P>
However, not all of those arrested were released. Dozens were kept in custody for weeks. They were then submitted to the Court of State Security charged with instigating riots, violating the law that forbids citizens from taking the King's name in vain, and destruction of property. These actions by the Jordanian government were meant to serve as example and threat to potential demonstrators.
<P>
In the meantime, further arrests, interrogations, and persecution of Jordanian citizens charged to be involved in the October demonstrations continued.
<P>
On 14 November, the Prisoners Committee, a subcommittee of the Popular Committees for the Support of the Aqsa Intifada and the Protection of Jordan, called for a sit-in before the Prime Minister's office to demand the release of those arrested in the demonstrations and an immediate cessation of arrests and the persecution of activists and citizens. The sit-in was banned by force. The few dozen who took part in it anyway were forcibly disbanded and arrested.
<P>
Among those arrested were Dr. Riyad Nawayseh, former member of parliament, Khaled Ramadan, Kinda Hattar, Dr. Aida Dabbas, Abeer Dabbas, Mouwaffaq Mahadeen, Saad Abadi, Dr. Ibrahim Alloush, Dr. Hisham Bustani, Shadi Mdanaat, Muhammad Abu Rahmeh, Jihad Abu Falah, and Khaled Odwan.
<P>
On 3 December, Khaled Odwan received an official call from members of the Jordanian General Intelligence to come for a talk the following morning at the central headquarters of General Intelligence. He left his home on 4 December and until today he hasn't returned back.
<P>
Security forces entered his home on 5 December, searched the place and went away with a number of books and papers. Complaints have already been filed with the Arab Organization for Human Rights.
<P>
On 9 December, Issam Adnan was rearrested from his home and still did not return. He was called in for questioning. Since he refused the security forces came to his home and arrested him.
<P>
Hanthala Palestine calls for the release of Khaled Odwan and protests the wave of persecution against Jordanian citizens and activists thought to be involved in demonstrations in support of the Intifada. Everyday people are arrested or called in for questioning. There are many more arrested than the ones we do know about.
<P>
Hanthala Palestine calls on the Jordanian government to lift any restriction on its citizens and in particular Palestinian refugees from showing their support and solidarity with the Palestinian people, in particular those who are currently struggling to end the occupation, oppression and discrimination;
<P>
Hanthala Palestine calls on the Jordanian government to immediate release citizens recently detained, in particular, Khaled Odwan, for expressing their solidarity with the Palestinian people. This action violates basic human rights, in particular, the freedom of opinion and expression (art. 19 UDHR, ICCPR); the freedom of movement (art. 13 UDHR, art. 12 ICCPR), the freedom from torture and degrading treatment (art. 5 UDHR, art. 7 ICCPR), and the protection against arbitrary detention (art. 9 UDHR, ICCPR).
<P>
