<b>Hanthala Palestine: The Network</b>
<p><img align="right" src="bars.gif">
In the summer of 1998, a group of Palestinians felt the need and urge to 
reorganize and educate themselves and others about the injustice that has been committed against the Palestinians. After extensive discussions amongst a group of young, active Palestinians inside and outside of Palestine it was decided to establish a network.  The main intent of grassroots networking was to inform themselves and others about  injustices taking place and to use this network to advocate their cause and act upon it.
<P>
Its main criterion is drawn from a human rights perspective. What is happening in Palestine is one human rights violation after another.  This aspect of the conflict, the fact that there is no human dignity left and that the defense of Palestinians' basic rights is being lost in so-called "security-debates," is one of the main starting points of this network..
<P>
Through advocacy and grassroots activism Hanthala established itself as an active network involved in various coalitions and networks, using communication-technology as a tool to mobilize the grassroots dedicated to human rights and international law.
<P>
Hanthala tries to focus on the human rights aspect, international laws, and aims at educating the world about Palestine. One part of a solution to the conflict is to have international human rights standards adhered to.
<P>
<font size=2><b>THE NAME</b></font>
<P>
The name Hanthala derives from the political cartoons of the famous Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali. The network's philosophy can best be encapsulated in Naji al-Ali's explanation about Hanthala, the little boy who appears as a spectator in each of his cartoons: "This child, as you can see is neither beautiful, spoiled, nor even well-fed. He is barefoot like many children in refugee camps. Those who came to know 'Hanthala,' as I
discovered later, adopted him because he is affectionate, honest, outspoken, and a bum. He is an icon that stands to watch me from slipping. And his hands behind his back are a symbol of rejection of all the present negative tides in our region." 
<P>
The use of the name "Hanthala" for this network is justified when Naji al-Ali stated: "The greatest struggle is continuity in spite of all contradictions. He is witness to a generation that did not die and he will not leave life ever. He is eternal. Hanthala, who I created, will not end after my end. I hope that this is not an exaggeration when I say that I will 
continue to live with Hanthala, even after I die." On Wednesday July 22nd, 1987 Naji al-Ali was shot in the head by a lone gunman.
<P>
<font size=2><b>HANTHALA'S ACTIVITIES</b></font>
<p>
Beginning in the summer of 1998, we established a mailinglist, attracting active participants in debates on the current state of affairs in our world. Discussing strategies, tactics and values along which we could unite the grassroots and (re)connect the Palestinians inside Palestine (the Occupied Territories, as well as those living beyond the "Green Line") and those living in exile around the world. 
<P>
The network functions as an alternative source of news for both the inside as well as those around the world, on the developments in the field of human rights and political processes in Palestine, providing a base for activism. The network developed itself further when key-members met in Palestine in June 1999, evaluating the previous year and strategically planned future steps and focus of the network. It was decided to use
its website as an information resource on various issues and violations and to 
play an active role in mobilizing its members in collective efforts to advocate and educate the world about the injustices in Palestine and network around coalitions. In addition to functioning as a resource of information, the website also attracts new members. New members can join easily to the unrestricted mailinglist through the website.
<P>
The network itself is located in Europe, but its members are from all over the world. Through its mailinglists the network focuses on activism through its <font size=2><b><a href="actnow.html">ACTNOW!</a></b></font>-policies (mobilizing and updates), playing a major part in collective campaigns, in co-operation with US-based organizations and existing other Palestinian and Arab networks, such as on <font size=2><a href="burger.html"><b>BURGER KING</b></a></font>, <font size=2><a href="disney.html"><b>DISNEY</b></a></font> and <font size=2><a href="kappa2.html"><b>KAPPA</b></a></font>. Through petition-campaigns, world-wide letters-to-the-editor, mobilizing protest-letters and, actively involving itself in holding corporations accountable for human rights violations in Palestine. Additionally, Hanthala Palestine disseminates information on a wide-range of  subjects related to human rights and international law.
<P>
<font size=2><b>HANTHALA'S NETWORKING</b></font>
<P>
Through its activism Hanthala worked closely with activists in Palestine, Europe and created links and coalitions (for collective action) with US-based Arab-American organizations and groups. Hanthala's constituency is young, active, and grassroots and its strength is in non-political, non-factional dedication to the respect of universal human rights and international law. These are the only criteria upon which Hanthala acts.
