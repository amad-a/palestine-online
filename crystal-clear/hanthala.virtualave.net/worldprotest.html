<font size=2><b>NEW YORK, US</b></font>
<P>
In New York, 5,000 demonstrators virtually shutdown Times Square, the hub of New York's theatre district, on Friday afternoon protesting the killing of at least 80 Palestinians by the Israeli forces in Gaza and the American support for Israel. They also offered their Juma prayers in the Times Square. 
<P>
Protesters carried Palestinian flags and banners saying "Stop The Israeli Massacre of Palestinian Children" and "Stop the Bloodshed" as they chanted, "End the Occupation Now." Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting for the last nine days throughout Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The conflicts have left 77 dead, and more than 1,900 injured, most of them Palestinian.
<P>
On countless posters they hoisted the photocopied image of 12-year-old Mohammad al-Durrah in his father's arms, fatally wounded in the crossfire in Gaza between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Marchers chanted "We're Muslims, we're Americans and we vote," a message the protesters said they were particularly eager to send to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for Senate from New York.  
<P>
"I'm here because I'm an anti-racist," said Shiko Bihar, a Jewish Israeli graduate student at Columbia University. "This is state terror. " The violence in the Middle East began after a Sept. 28 visit by Ariel Sharon, the leader of the hard-line opposition Likud party, to the Jerusalem site called Noble Sanctuary by Muslims and Temple Mount by Jews.
<P>
To articulate their sorrow over children killed in the Mideast violence, many protesters brought their children to the rally. They held flowers, sat under police barricades, and pressed forward to share their thoughts. Several said they would not forget the image of Mohammad slumped in his father's arms, an image shown frequently on television and in the nation's newspapers this week. 
<P>
The presence of the massive crowd had police shutting the area down to vehicle traffic during the evening commute. Hundreds of officers lined the streets, and put up barricades to keep the demonstrators within one street lane.
<P><img align="right" src="amman1.jpg">
<font size=2><b>AMMAN, JORDAN</b></font>
<P>
In Amman, Jordan, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets to protest the Israeli massacre of Palestinians, clashing with hundreds of riot police. Police blocked the streets leading to the Israeli Embassy in the affluent district of al-Rabieh, firing tear gas at more than 1,000
protesters, who tried to march from the Kalooti Mosque after Muslim noon prayers to the embassy. For several hours, police continued to fire tear gas cannisters at the crowds, which repeatedly dispersed and regrouped, trying to break the police barrier to reach the Israeli Embassy without success. 
<P>
Demonstrators chanted "Allah Akbar," (God is great), "We want to liberate al-Rabieh from the Zionist boots," and "We are saying clearly, close the Jewish embassy." They hurled stones at police, calling them "pigs of the Zionists" as residents in the fancy buildings and small children gave away onions to the demonstrators to reduce the effect of tear gas, a trick learned from the Palestinians.
<P>
Helicopters hovered over the capital, which witnessed a number of such confrontations between angry protesters demanding the closure of the Israeli Embassy and heavily-geared police in the first such widespread demonstrations since the anti-U.S. protests during the 1991 Gulf war against Iraq. Major intersections in Amman resembled a battle ground littered with stones and tear gas cannisters, with black smoke from burning tires and white smoke from the tear gas rising over Amman's valleys.
<P>
Several police tanks and armored vehicles were mobilized in one main intersection, carrying scores of riot police who fired bullets in the air and tear gas cannisters into the crowds, which shouted: "Turn your guns against the Jews."
<P>
Friday's widespread protests, which also included similar moves in the country's 13 Palestinian refugee camps after Friday noon prayers, came despite pleas by government-appointed mosque imams (speakers) to refrain from street protests and eventual clashes with police. One imam said: "Don't turn the sacrifices of our people in Palestine into a confrontation of Muslim against Muslim and Arab against Arab while the Jews watch...May God take his revenge against the Jews, and may the White House be draped in black."
<P>
Osama Abdul Karim (18) was shot by anti-riot police who resorted to live ammunition to disperse thousands of demonstrations at the entrance of the camp. Camp residents said over 50 residents were hurt in the clashes.
<P>
"A bullet hit me in the hip," said Ahmad Hussein, showing his injury and adding that he feared going to hospital for treatment in the wake of a police round up of suspects.
<P>
On Friday night the Jordanian government issued a ban to the wave of street protests against Israel, saying hooligans among disciplined protesters were exploiting a public outpouring of emotions to vandalise public property.
<P>
Scores of anti-riot police remained positioned on the main highway leading to the camp in a show of force against renewed trouble, witnesses said. Over the last few days, the government deployed hundreds of anti-riot police with dozens of armoured personnel carriers and fired tear gas to control hundreds of stone-throwing youths in the largest Palestinian camps of Wihadat and Beqaa.
<P>
Witnesses said scores of youths took to the streets, smashed traffic lights and burnt tyres in various parts of the city after police used teargas to disperse marches that planned to march on the Israeli embassy in Amman.
<P><img align="right" src="holland7.jpg">
<font size=2><b>THE HAGUE, THE NETHERLANDS</b></font>
<P>
In the Dutch city, the Hague a demonstration in front of the Israeli embassy turned violent after provocative action from the Dutch police. Some 700 Palestinians, Arabs and Dutch gathered at 15.30 in front of the Israeli embassy, across the Dutch parliament. There seemed to be a
misunderstanding about the police permit which said that only some 100 people were allowed on the square in front of the embassy and that others should have stand in front of the parliament. However, at 15.45 some 700 people gathered in front of the Israeli embassy and were stopped by the Dutch police who were in full force with police on horses and riot police.
<P>
When some Israeli flags were burned the police dismissed the demonstration and started to disperse the demonstration. People were forced into the direction that lead to the American embassy in the Hague, some 100 meters away from the Israeli embassy in the city's center. Palestinians chanted slogans against the Israeli agression against Palestinians and against the killing of children. Again, the Dutch police started to disperse violently the demonstration. Some Palestinians and others were hit. 
<P>
One of the protesters, a Palestinian after he was beaten by the Dutch police with clubs said: "I expect this attitude and behaviour from the Israeli occupation, but not from the Dutch police". He came to Holland in 1992 for medical care after he was released from
administrative detention in which he was severely tortured by his Israeli interrogators.
<P>
At one point some people responded to the police by throwing stones. Passing the French embassy some windows were damaged. The Palestinians and their supporters demonstrated against the Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians. Most of the crowd came directly from the mosques after attending Friday prayers. Three protestors were injured and four were arrested.
<P>
<font size=2><b>SYRIA, DAMASCUS</b></font>
<P>
On Friday 6 October, Syrian security forces clashed with demonstrators in Damascus and prevented them from approaching the U.S. Embassy. The demonstrators, who came from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk near Damascus, were protesting the Israeli attacks against
Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Hundreds of Syrian anti-riot policemen and Army soldiers, who brought reinforcements to the area and blocked all roads leading to the U.S. Embassy, clashed with protestors who tried to force their way.  
<P>
They dispersed the demonstrators, using tear gas and water, according to witnesses who said a number of people were wounded "as blood stains trailed on the ground" and a number of cars were damaged. Earlier, witnesses said that anti-riot policemen and Army soldiers, wearing helmets and holding clubs, cordonned off the area and blocked access to the U.S. Embassy, the residence of U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and The American School.  
<P>
They said four ambulances and four fire engines were seen in the area since morning, while the security forces placed steel blocks on the ground.  The security measures were meant to prevent demonstrators from approaching the embassy which came under stone-throwing attacks by angry Syrian protestors on Wednesday. The embassy closed down after Wednesday's attack which inflicted light material damage to the building. 
<P>
<font size=2><b>BEIRUT, LEBANON</b></font>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinian refugees staged protests Friday in shantytowns in south Lebanon, calling for resuming the armed struggle against Israel and urging the Arabs to end normalization. More than 5,000 refugees demonstrated inside the refugee camp of Ein el-Helweh on the outskirts of the port city of Sidon in southern Lebanon, shouting "Yes to Jerusalem" and "Jihad (armed struggle) should continue." The demonstrators included 100 armed guerrillas of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas movements who paraded in the camp. Most of the guerrillas had black hoods and wore on their backs empty black boxes on which were written TNT explosives. They also carried symbolic Soviet-made Katyasha rockets with banners that read: "With this weapon, the enemy (Israel) understands." 
<P><img align="right" src="yarin.jpg"
The protesters in Ein el-Helweh waved Palestinian flags and banners that called for backing the "Intifada" (uprising) of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza. Jihad spokesman Abu Imad Rifai denounced the "massacres" committed by Israel against the Palestinians and called for an emergency Arab summit to prevent Israeli attempts to "Judaize Jerusalem." Rifai said armed struggle was the only way to liberate Palestine and Holy Jerusalem, saying the "Muslims in the Arab world would come to the rescue of Palestine and will liberate Jerusalem." 
<P>
Similar protests took place in refugee camps near the port city of Tyre in southern Lebanon where thousands of angry demonstrators burned an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. The protesters called on Lebanese President Emile Lahoud to open the border in south Lebanon before military operations by Palestinian guerrillas.  A camp leader in Rashidiyeh, Sheikh
Ali Daoud,on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to immediately stop the peace talks "because they led us to where we are now." 
<P>
On the Lebanese-Israeli front, dozens of Lebanese and Palesinian students staged a sit-in for the second consecutive day in the Abbad post to express solidarity with the "Intifada" of the Palestinian people. The students performed prayers and waved to Israeli soldiers on the other side of the fence with Palestinian flags and pictures of Palestinian children killed by
Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank. Security sources said Gen. Gaby Ashkinazi, Israeli commander of the northern region, was inspecting the Abbad area at a time of the protest and ordered his soldiers to move to another position.  
<P>
In Beirut, some 400 Lebanese gathered after the midday Muslim prayers while Muslim Sunni Mufti (religious leader) Mohammed rashid Qabbani called for Jihad to help the Palestinian people. Shortlly before, some 50 Lebanese children protested in front of the U.N. House and handed a memorandum to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan denouncing the killing of Palestinian
children by Israeli forces. According to UNICEF, 17 Palestinian children were killed in a week of bloody confrontations in the West Bank and Gaza while 40 percent of the injured were below the age of 18.
<P>
<font size=2><b>KHARTOUN, SUDAN</b></font>
<P>
Thousands of Sudanese Muslims burning Israeli flags and chanting "Jerusalem is ours!" demonstrated in Khartoum on Thursday in protest against Israel's killing of more than 60 Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. Shouting "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest),
the demonstrators demanded the return of Jerusalem to Arab control, with some calling for holy war to "liberate" the city after violence over the past week in the West Bank, Gaza and Israeli Arab towns.
<P>
The protesters -- who included representatives of political parties, trade unions, students and women -- demanded pro-Palestinian action from Muslim governments and people, saying words were not enough. "The Arabs and Muslims should no longer rely on negotiations but on the force of arms and on the struggle for the liberation of Jerusalem," said the Secretary General of Sudan's ruling National Congress party, Ibrahim Ahmed Omar.
<P>
"Arab and Muslim governments should open up their seaports and airports so that young people can go to Palestine to wage jihad (holy war)," one protester shouted. The governor of Khartoum state, Majzoub al-Khalifa, said Khartoum would put all its resources at the Palestinians' disposal for the "liberation of the holy Jerusalem."
<P>
The demonstrators marched to the local United Nations compound and handed over a communique condemning the recent Israeli-Palestinian violence. "The United Nations that speaks all the time about human rights and peace and the struggle against terrorism is now turning a blind eye to the most brutal human rights violations and terrorism," the statement said.

<P>
On Friday, a picket was being held outside Britain's Prime Minister's office at Downing Street 10, expressing outrage at the failure of the UK to condemn the Israeli killing of more than 60 Palestinians. Blair has yet to make a statement since the massacres began over a week ago. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has deplored the killings but has avoided criticising Israel in any way. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain was quoted saying Thursday that the responsibility for the atrocities is "clear to everybody, but issuing public denunciations gets us nowhere in the urgent quest for peace."

<font size=2><b>BAGHDAD, IRAQ</b></font>
<P>
More than 5000 Iraqi students on Saturday, Oct. 7, 2000, protest in Baghdad against the latest Israel-Arab violence. The group burnt Israeli and American flags and held up slogans demanding revenge for what they see as Israeli-American aggression policies that are biased to Israel.

<P>
<font size=2><b>ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN</b></font>
<P>
Demonstrators in the Pakistani capital on Friday condemned the killing of Palestinians by Israeli security forces during a week of confrontations in Israel and the occupied territories.

The organisation said it was also holding demonstrations in other Pakistani cities. 
<P>
Public demonstrations are relatively rare in the Pakistani capital and about 30 police carrying sticks stood by as the protest against Israel was held in front of the mosque, the largest in Asia. A total of 69 people, almost all of them Arabs, have died in a week of clashes with Israeli security forces that began with the visit of rightwing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to a site - called the Temple Mount by Jews and the al-Haram al-Sharif by Muslims - that is sacred to both religions.
<P>
<font size=2><b>DUBAI, UAE</b></font>
<P>
Men, women and children marched in Dubai on Friday to protest the violence taking place in the occupied territories. Shouting slogans against Israel, Zionism and Ariel Sharon - the Israeli opposition leader who triggered the violence - the marchers showed their deep resentment of the Israeli soldiers who shot Palestinians as they performed prayers at the Al Aqsa mosque. Students from Ajman University began a protest march at Sharjah's Khalid Lagoon but were stopped by the police and told they were not allowed to march.
<P>
Raad Fayed, an Ajman University student, told Gulf News that the Sharjah Police patrol asked the protesters to stop their march and leave because it is the weekend and they could cause a traffic jam. "When we were trying to march early this afternoon, the Sharjah police stopped the march by a few students from the Ajman University," he said.
<P>
"My friends and I decided to come to Dubai to make our protest march and were welcomed by a Dubai Police patrol who cleared the traffic for our march, which started from the Corniche opposite the Hyatt Regency Hotel."
<P>
He added that by the time they started their protest march in Dubai, they were joined by more people from the street. "In a matter of minutes, people had parked their cars and joined us, as also did passers-by. There weren't just Palestinians in the protest march, but UAE nationals, Saudis, Iraqis and Egyptians. Batoul Zaidan, another student at Ajman University, said that on Wednesday when they attempted a protest march in the University just as in many other
Arab countries, the university security stopped them. When they attempted to go into the streets, Ajman police arrested a few students and took away the the drivers' licences of the rest. "Apparently someone tipped off the police about our intention to conduct a protest march because the patrols were near the University just waiting for us, and normally they do not post
more than one patrol nearby," she explained.
<P>
Elsewhere, hundreds of Palestinians and members of other communities took part in a procession in Ras Al Khaimah yesterday. Protesters burned Israeli flags and expressed messages of warm support for families and relatives of Palestinians in the occupied territories. They also chanted slogans in support of the Palestinians and expressed their anger at Israeli troops.
<P>
Kamal Abdul Rahman, who took part in the procession, said the Palestinian community, in coordination with other Arabs and friends in Ras Al Khaimah, would hold many other such processions. Also, members of the Palestinian community would begin raising funds to support Palestinians in the Occupied Territory.

<font size=2><b>CAIRO, EGYPT</b></font>
<P>
Several policemen and students were injured as security forces tried to stop demonstrators marching on the Israeli embassy on Friday. The clashes followed a protest in Cairo against the Israeli massacre of Palestinian civilians. The demonstration took place after Friday prayers.
<P>
<font size=2><b>TUNIS, TUNIS</b></font>
<P>
Some 10,000 people gathered at a rally near Tunis on Friday, to voice their support for Palestinians as clashes continued in Jerusalem. The crowd shouted slogans at an officially-sanctioned rally in Kram, 10 kilometres north of the capital of this North African nation. "With our souls and our blood, we will sacrifice ourselves for you, Palestine," the people shouted. The rally was attended by officials, opposition parties and non-governmental agencies.
<P>
<font size=2><b>MUSCAT, OMAN</b></font>
<P>
In Muscat, for the third day running, more than a 1,000 demonstrators, mainly students, marched for two hours in the heart of the capital near the Sultan Qaboos Mosque. Policemen were present but did not intervene in the march, a rarity in the sultanate. An Omani teacher, who was among the protestors, said anything short of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital would be unacceptable to the Arabs.  "Today, we are precisely demanding this loudly
and collectively," said the teacher who requested anonymity.
<P>
<font size=2><b>TEHRAN, IRAN</b></font>
<P>
In Tehran, some 10,000 people took to the streets to protest the death of the Palestinians. "The only way left for the liberation of Palestine is resistance and jihad (holy war) against the Zionist occupation," parliament speaker Mahdi Karrubi told the demonstrators in the city's Palestine Square. "Experience has shown that talks and reconciliation with Israel is an
exercise in futility," said Karrubi. Behind the podium from which he spoke, a large banner said: "Death to America." The demonstrators also burned an American flag.
<P>
<font size=2><b>RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA</b></font>
<P>
In Riyadh, the imam of one of the Saudi capital's largest mosques called for jihad against Israel and its supporters. "Washington supports Israel blindly. American embassies, companies and individuals are legitimate targets and must be targeted by Muslims all over the world," said the imam, Sheikh Mansour bin Ali Al Hussein. His call for jihad coincided with a U.S.
announcement yesterday that its diplomatic missions in the Middle East would be closed to the public for several days due to mounting Arab protests.
<P>
<font size=2><b>KUWAIT, KUWAIT</b></font>
<P>
In Kuwait, human rights activist and candidate in the upcoming by-elections, Omran Hassan Mohammad, will lead demonstrations which will be held in front of the embassies of the permanent Security Council members to protest the violence against the Palestinians. "A whole nation is oppressed. We need to speak out against it," Mohammed told Gulf News in a
telephone interview. 
<P>
Mohammed, who is a Shiite activist and teaches chemical engineering at Kuwait University, was picked up by state security officers on Sunday when he staged a one-man protest against the violence in front of the parliament building. He said he was not charged and was released after 28 hours. He is running for the seat of Al Adiliya constituency which was vacated in August
upon the death of liberal legislator Sami Al Munayes.
<P>
Mohammed charged any protests against America or Israel are particularly sensitive. "There are so many secret agents among us and they appear when we speak out about America or Israel.  We live among fragile regimes who are afraid that people will join in if I or others set up a protest," he said. Mohammed was arrested twice in 1998 for demonstrating against U.S. policies in the region. Today, Mohammad and other activists will stand in a silent protest in front of the American, British, French, Russian and Chinese embassies.
<P>
<font size=2><b>TORONTO, CANADA</b></font>
<P>
Some 200 protested in Toronto on Friday. Dressed in an Israeli army  uniform and helmet, his hands and face covered in fake blood and standing three feet higher than usual on makeshift stilts, the 30-year-old contractor waved banners and paced up and down University Ave. across the street from the U.S. consulate Friday to protest the recent violence between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.
<P>
As dozens of police officers stood ready, the Toronto protesters burned American and Israeli flags and waved Palestinian flags outside the University courthouse across from the consulate and carried two mock coffins draped with Palestinian flags.
<P>
The coffins were for 12-year-old Mohammad Al Durra, who was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza during a clash this week between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters, and the ambulance driver who tried to rescue him.
<P>
"The stalling of the peace process and our frustration with that added up with Ariel Sharon's visit ... and the killing of the 12-year-old boy are the reasons we are here," said Ali Mallah, president of the Toronto chapter of the Canadian Arab Federation.
<P>
"We want peace back, but a fair peace," said Aikholani. "We want to show people were are democratic," he said. "I am trying to do something for the Palestinians. These are my cousins who died. They are your cousins because together we are all human beings," he said. Mallah said U.S. policy in the region favours Israel. "We are here to send a message to the U.S. to say it's about time to stop the one-eye blind policies in the Mideast," Mallah said.
<P>
Concurrent pro-Palestinian demonstrations were also held in Hamilton, Waterloo and Ottawa, Mallah said. The Toronto protest was the second in the last two days.
<P>
<font size=2><b>SAN FRANCISCO, US</b></font>
<P>
About 3,000 demonstrators in front of San Francisco City Hall later marched to the Israeli consulate on Montgomery Street yesterday to protest the Israeli forces' treatment of Palestinians during the violence in the Holy Land. Protesters -- including this young girl
waving Palestinian flags -- burned Israeli flags, made impassioned speeches and shouted anti-Israel slogans. San Francisco police said there were no arrests.	
<P>
<font size=2><b>PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC</b></font>
<P>
Some 250 people have demonstrated peacefully in front of the Israeli Embassy in Prague, Radio Prague reported on Saturday. The demonstrators, primarily Palestinians living in the Czech     
Republic, were protesting recent violent clashes in the West Bank and Gaza, in which over 60 people, predominantly Palestinian have died, Radio Prague added.
<P>
<font size=2><b>CALGARY, CANADA</b></font>
<P>
In front of the City Hall of Calgary, more than 400 people protested Friday against the latest
Israeli massacres in Palestine. All arabs (muslims and christians), Canadians and non-arab muslims marched towards the American Consulate at the Rocky Plaza Mall down town Calgary.  Tens of young guys with coffeyyahs and Palestinian flags stood at the traffic lights and delivered leaflets that described the latest massacres and pictures of the Martyr Rami Al durrah and his father under the gunfire. The high one man-like cry in the air was " Allahu AKbar"  . In English, the one we used most was Calgary Calgary hear us cry Tell us why our kids must die.
<P>
Police men walked around just making sure it was a peaceful rally. Canadians pedestrians and drivers were very interested in taking the leaflets and finding out what all this was about, and I think that was the most important thing , spread awareness.  One Canadian guy, in his middle age maybe 40, stopped me and said: "That is what you should have done long time ago, and more often, we're sick of all this Israeli arrogance in front of out noses, may God bless you".
