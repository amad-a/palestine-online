<b>Prisoners: An Introduction</b>
<p>
In spite of the fact that Israel released 236 Palestinian detainees
from its jails in compliance with the Sharm al-Shiekh agreement, 1400
Palestinian and Arab prisoners, of which 15 are held in administrative
detention, are still being held in Israeli jails, a matter violating
the Geneva Fourth Convention of 1949 which provides for the
prohibition of transferring the detainees from the occupied land to
the land of the occupying country. Furthermore, the Israeli prison
administration continues to hold prisoners in very bad conditions.
This led to the death of two Palestinian detainees during the year.
<P>
Moreover, Shabak (the Israeli General Security Services) still
subjects detainees to torture despite the verdict of the Israeli High
Court issued on September 6 1999, which bans torture and considered
torture methods used against Palestinian detainees illegal. During the
same year the Israeli occupying forces arrested many Palestinians. LAW
was able to obtain release decisions for 22 prisoners from Israeli
jails. The release came within the framework of LAW's program, which
is dedicated to release prisoners who serve two thirds of their
sentence.
<P>
Palestinian detainees in Israeli detention centres continue to be exposed to
torture by the Israeli General Security Services (GSS) in spite of the
September 6 1999 decision of the Israeli High Court which bans torture
and considered the torture methods used against the Palestinian
detainees illegal. 
<P>
Despite the criticism voiced by <a href="humanrights.html">human rights</a> organizations against the Palestinian Authority's practice of political detention against dissidents, particularly the Islamic opposition, and despite the innumerable calls to put an end to
the issue of political detention including decisions taken by the
Legislative Council, marches and demonstrations by the relatives of
political detainees, open hunger strikes by the political detainees,
and high court decisions requesting the release of the political
detainees, the PNA continued to hold an estimated 250 political
detainees in its prisons. The High Court has ordered the release of
50. Many have already spent more than two years in custody after the
release order had been issued in their favor such as Mahmoud Musleh
whose release was ordered by the High Court on 30 November 1997 and
Ghassan Al Adassi who release was ordered by the High Court on 6
October 1998. Only nine of the total number of political detainees,
who have already spent 5 years in prison, have been tried Trial
conditions that do not meet the minimum standards of a fair trial.
Among the detainees are 26 university students and 2 secondary school
pupils.
<P>
Despite the harsh criticism voiced by human rights organizations
against the use of torture by the security services during the
interrogation period of suspects in the past five years, the security
services continue to use torture and maltreatment as a means to
extract confessions.
