<b>A Case of Holding Corporations Accountable: South Africa</b>
<p>
<img align="right" src="nooo.jpg">
During the "business hearings" of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission of South Africa (TRC), the relationship between apartheid and
the economy, the role of business, government and trade unions were
examined. "No one admits today to having supported apartheid", commented
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of the TRC, in his opening remarks
to the hearings. Given the internal political constraints of the TRC, it
is unfortunate that the binding precedents of international human rights
instruments guaranteeing economic rights and condemning apartheid as a
crime against humanity were not invoked in these hearings to hold
business accountable for human rights violations under apartheid during
the period of the TRC's investigation. The international condemnations
of apartheid over decades as well as other human rights instruments
overlap to provide norms and standards which govern economic life.
<P>
The TRC's precedential contributions toward establishing a framework and
principles in the universal quest for holding perpetuators of human
rights violations accountable for their crimes.
<P>
<ol>
<li>The TRC succeeded in implementing the concept of corporate
accountability in the context of a State entity and through a public,
transparent process even with its inherent constraints as a negotiated
reform and in the reality of the new Government's dependency
relationship with apartheid-era businesses. The TRC treated businesses'
representatives with the same equality as other witnesses, and did not
accord them the privileges to which they had been accustomed during
apartheid. The hearings enabled the TRC to make an historical record
and, through this process, put businesses on notice that present and
future violations will not be condoned. The efforts of white businesses
to expunge their crimes from history and, in that process, revise that
history, had simply failed.</li>
<P>
<li>The findings of the Final Report on business removed the distinction
between the public and the private spheres in an apartheid society in
which a legislated racial context governed everyone's every activity,
from cradle to grave. They dispelled the notion that business existed in
a political vacuum, and rejected the view that the economic sector
functions separately from and outside of its political environment. They
discredited the position that 'private' white businesses were not
affected by and did not benefit from apartheid legislation. On the
contrary, the findings support that in the nexus of the economic and
political spheres, a profitable, symbiotic relationship for white
businesses, particularly with the military/security machine of the
State, was fostered. While the report concludes that most white
businesses benefitted from the racial structures of apartheid, it
acknowledged that the levels of benefit and involvement varied.</li>
<P>
<li>The findings affirmed the collusion and complicity of business with
apartheid, and detailed that at least over the more than three decades
of apartheid's rule, business was a linchpin in the
military/industrial/security complex of South Africa's repressive and
authoritarian regime.</li>
<P>
<li>The TRC, unique among truth commissions to examine the role of
business in a previous authoritarian regime, set a precedent for
expanding the definition of human rights violations to include economic
issues and for broadening the definition of perpetuators of human rights
violations to include business entities, going beyond State actors in
official capacities in governmental and military/security positions.
This is important in the context of struggles to hold private corporate
entities accountable for human rights violations and the efforts of
non-governmental organisations to include socio-economic crimes in
international criminal codes, such as the Rome Statute for the
Establishment of an International Criminal Court.</li>
