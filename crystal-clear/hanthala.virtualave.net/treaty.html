<b>Hanthala's International Treaty Bodies Monitor</b>
<p>
Every year, Hanthala Palestine will provide a overview of the work of
the Treaty Bodies, which monitor the implementation of human rights
conventions: The Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on Elimination of all Forms of
Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women, the Committee against Torture, and the
Committee on the Rights of the Child. Hanthala Palestine will summarise
those parts which concern Palestine.
<p>
<font size=2><b>(1) HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE (HRC)</B></FONT>
<br>63rd session (Geneva, 13-31 July 1998) 
<P>
The Committee took note of Israel's concern about security, frequent
attacks on the civil population, and the fact that Israel is officially
at war with several of its neighbours. However, it drew the attention of
the Israeli authorities to article 4 of the Pact, which authorises no
exception to certain fundamental rights, even in cases of exceptional
public danger. The Committee requested Israel to consider the
possibility of lifting the state of emergency, in application since
independence, and in recognising its responsibility om the application
of the Covenant in the Occupied Territories, in Southern Lebanon and the
Western Bekaa, both of which are under its control. There are deeply
rooted social attitudes, practices and laws which discriminate against
Palestinians in Israel (resulting in a significantly lower standard of
living than Jews in Israel) and against Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories who do not enjoy the same rights and freedoms as Jewish
settlers (access to land and water, for instance). Palestinians cannot
move freely, their land is confiscated and their homes can be demolished
as reprisals. A directive from the Ministry of the Interior states that
Palestinians who cannot prove that East Jerusalem was the 'centre of
their life' for the last seven years can lose their right to live there.
There are also obstacles to family reunions in cases of marriage between
Israeli citizens and non-Jewish foreigners. 
<P>
The Committeee's main concerns: - Brutality by forces of repression: In
Israel, the Committee was concerned by the fact that many Palestinians
including children, were killed by dispersion weapons used by security
forces during demonstrations. This is all the more disturbing when
considered alongside a draft law that would deny victims the right to
compensation for abuses committed by members of the security forces
against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. During interrogation
of presumed terrorists, security forces are allowed to use 'moderate
physical pressure', which is nothing more than torture. It is aso
disturbing that those kept in administrative detention for security
reasons can be held without trial for long periods in order to
facilitate negotiations with other parties on the release of Israeli
soldiers being held prisoner.

<FONT SIZE=2><b>(2) COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS (CESCR)</B></FONT>
<br>19th session (Geneva, 16 November- 4 December 1998) 
<P>
The Committeee noted that the general discrimination against Arab
subjects (more than 29% of the population) is made worse by the fact
that Israel puts excessive stress on the fact that it is a Jewish state,
which gives non-Jewish citizens second-class status. The lack of
information in the report by Israel on the situation of the Palestinians
in Israel and the Occupied Territories is very unedifying. The Committee
strenuously condemned the spread of Jewish colonies in the Occupied
Territories, the systematic, large-scale confiscation of Palestinian
land and property, the forced exclusion of Jalahin Bedouin families from
their ancestral land and the sealing-off of the Occupied Territories
since 1993. In East Jerusalem, a Ministry of the Interior directive may
cause Palestinians to lose their right to live in that part of the city.
Their homes are demolished and their land confiscated to the advantage
of Jewish residents whose number now exceeds that of Palestinian
residents. In the Old City of East Jerusalem, as in the Arab quarters of
mixed cities, such as Haifa and Lydda, the Palestinians live in slums
because they cannot undertake repair or renovation work without Israeli
permission.
<P>
Among the 200,000 Palestinian citizens displaced and ddispossessed
within Israel, many continue to live in unrecognised villages, without
water, electricity, sewage, roads, health care, education or work.
Generally-speaking, the non-Jewish population lives in extreme poverty,
experiencing malnutrition, separated families, unemployment, infant
mortality, no access to the water supply, electricity or sewage, no
social services, or health care, including maternity care. The Committee
urgently requested Israel to respect the right to self-determination
(par.2 art.1 of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),
according to which "under no circumstances can a people be deprived of
its own means of subsistence". It also exhorted Israel to provide
complementary information on the enjoyment of economic, social and
cultural rights in the Occupied Territories and in East Jerusalem as
well as on the plight of the Jahalin Bedouins. This information will be
studied at the 23rd session of the Committee in November-Decemnber 2000.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>(3) COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION (CERD)</B></FONT>
<br>52nd session (Geneva 2-20 March 1998)
<P>
The Committee members, to whom a wholly insufficient report had been
submitted, were unable to establish a constructive dialogue with the
Israeli delegation, which showed some irritability during the debates.
The insufficiencies noted in the implementation of the Convention have
contributed to a dangerous raising of tensions in the region and to
deadlock in the peace process. The Committee reaffirmed that the Jewish
colonies in the Occupied Territories, as well as actions which lead to
changes in population distribution, were illegal under modern
international law and constitute breaches in international humanitarian
law. A swift end mmust be brought to the demolition of Arab property in
East Jerusalem, to the torture of Palestinian detainees and to obstacles
to the rights of Palestinians to return to their homes or to taking
possession of their homes in Israel.

<FONT SIZE=2><b>(4) COMMITTEE AGAINST TORTURE (CAT)</B></FONT>
<br>20th session (Geneva 4-22 May 1998)
<P>
In 1997, the Committee studied a special report, which had been
requested a year earlier, following the Israeli High Court of Justice
decision to allow the security service, Shin Beth, to use "physiscal
pressure" during interrogations. The situation has hardly changed since
and the Committee noted that the methods that it considered as torture a
year before continue to be used in a systematic way*. The Committee
urgently requested that torture be stopped in the country, which is
alone in having legalised it. It reminded the Israeli government that
the security situation in the country was no justification for such
acts.
<P>
* According to B'Tselem, some 850 persons are victims of torture each
year.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>(5) COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN</B></FONT>
<br>42nd session (New York 2-13 March 1998)
<P>
Eight resolutions were adopted during this session. The resolution
concerning Palestinian women was the only one to be put to a vote (34 in
favour, US against, 5 abstentions: Lebanon, Lesotho, Norway, Rwanda,
Ugunda). This recommendation reiterates that the Israeli occupation is a
major obstacle to the progress of the rights of Palestinian women, and
urges Israel to facilitate the return of displaced Palestinian women and
children to their homes.

[The Commission on the Status of Women is a subsidiary body of the
Economic and Social Council makes recommendations to the Council
concerning the advancement of the rights of women in the political,
