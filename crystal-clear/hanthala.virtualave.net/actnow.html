<b>ACT NOW! Holding Israeli Corporations Accountable for Human Rights Violations</b>
<p>
<img align="right" src="nooo.jpg">
Israeli corporations are violating human rights by operating in Israeli
settlements build on confiscated Palestinian land. The establishment of
permanent Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories
(OPT) contravene international (humanitarian) law. According to that
law, an occupying power is prohibited from transferring population from
its territory it occupies, and from performing any act that is not
intended to benefit the local population. In addition, international law
prohibits creating permanent change not intended for the benefit of that
population. In their settlement policy, the various Israeli governments
have violated international law, in general, and international
agreements to which Israel is a party, in particular. Israel continues
to expropriate additional Palestinian lands, both private and public, to
expand settlements, and to build bypass roads.  
<p>
There is no distinction between the public and private spheres for those
involved in Israel's settlement policy. In the nexus of the economic and
political spheres, a profitable, symbiotic relationship for Israeli
corporations operating in Israeli settlements, particularly with the
Israeli military authority has been fostered. Israeli corporations
operating in Israeli settlements are perpetrators of human rights
violations and should be held accountable for this.
<p>
In the following we would like to ask your attention to the following
and take initial steps to hold Israeli and international corporations
accountable for human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories (OPT). As a step this could be a start of a boycott of the
Israeli companies presented in this message, but also international
corporations who are also to be hold accountable, such as <a href="burger.html">Burger King</a>,
which recently opened a restaurant in the Israeli Ma'ale Adumim
Settlement build on confiscated Palestinian land.

<b>ACT NOW!</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Boycott products produced in Israeli settlements;</li>
<li>Write your government:</li>
<ul>
<li>In the case of the European Union to implement the provisions of
the EC-Israel Agreement and to take steps to verify the accuracy of the
place of origin, according to the procedures that have been agreed with
Israel as follow-up to the Co-operation Committee of November 1997 and
to bring this to an end;</li>
<li>In the case of the US to follow the steps taken by the EU and to
prevent products produced by Israeli corporations operating in the
Israeli settlements to enter the US market;</li>
</ul>
<li>Enlist international corporations who operate in the Israeli
settlements and warn them of the possible consequences (boycott, for
example <a href="burger.html">Burger King</a>);</li>
<li>Complete the list of producers with international corporations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
With this action we could initiate and contribute to the continuing
struggle to hold corporations accountable for human rights violations.
