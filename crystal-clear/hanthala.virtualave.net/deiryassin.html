<b>Deir Yassin Remembered</b>
<p><img align="right" src="theend.jpg">
On 9 April 1948, 254 people, half of them women and children, were butchered in the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin. On 8 April 1970, Israeli war planes destroyed the Egyptian primary school of Bahr al-Baqr. Nineteen children were killed, many more were severely injured. On 18 April 1996, Israeli gunners shelled a UN camp in South Lebanon. Of the 400 villagers who had sought shelter in the Qana camp, 100 men, women and children were killed. On 8 April 1997, two Israeli settlers opened fire on unarmed Palestinian protesters in Hebron, killing 24-year-old Asem Arafeh. On the same day, the Israeli army, joined by armed settlers, killed two others, and wounded 103, as Palestinian residents of Hebron protested Arafeh's murder. Next year 50 years have been passed after the Deir Yassin Massacre, this year was the first anniversary of the Qana Massacre. 
<p>
The Deir Yassin massacre was neither the first nor the last in a series of massacres carried out by zionists in Palestine. It remains a highly potent symbol, however. While the Palestinians still mark the anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre, many know that the village no longer exists. The village's original houses were demolished, the plots of land replaced by 'public' gardens on which a new settlement was built. This settlement, together with others implanted after the inhabitants of occupied villages were evicted, and their homes destroyed, were administratively annexed to Jerusalem. All that is left of Deir Yassin is the memory of the massacre, still commemorated by Palestinians and Arabs today.

<br><font size=2><b>13 December 1947</b>: Men sitting at the coffee house of this Arab village saw what they thought was an approaching British Army patrol. Four patrol cars pulled up in front of the coffee house and men dressed in khaki uniforms and steel helmets stepped out. They were not British soldiers. The disguised jewish attackers sprayed the coffee shop with machine-gun fire and lobbed grenades at Arab homes. Fortunately, a real British patrol arrived at the scene soon afterward and stopped the killing. Otherwise, the death toll of seven Arabs could have been higher.</font>
