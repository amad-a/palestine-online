<b>Settlements: The Colonization Policy</b>
<p>
Since the signing of the Wye Agreement on 23 October 1998, the Israeli
authorities have given the green light to the construction of bypass
roads in the West Bank. Their purpose is to link the settlements to
each other and impose de-facto Israeli control and presence in order
to lay claim to these lands prior to the final status talks This
campaign of land grab, settlement expansion and building, and by-pass
road construction has been rapidly escalated. On 19 November 1998, the
Israeli Government initiated measures to grab a good 10% of land to
allow the further construction and expansion of settlements in the
West Bank. The Israeli government has stepped up its plans to
implement a policy of quiet deportation and ethnic cleansing in what
has come to be known, in the case of Jerusalem, as the city's
'judaisation'. Israeli officials have publicly declared that these
plans are meant to expropriate the large part of Palestinian land.
<p><img align="right" src="landc.jpg">
<font size=2><b>LAND CONFISCATION</b></font>
<P>
Jewish settlement organisations, often supported by the
government, have continued with activities against Palestinian
property and real estate. These activities are meant to consolidate
Jewish presence in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Since
the signing of the Wye Accord, an estimated 27385 dunums have been so
far confiscated, of which 15147 have been confiscated in the first
three months of the current year 1999, and a further 12238 dunums of
land has been expropriated since the signing of the accord to the end
of 1998. The expropriated land will be used for amongst other
purposes, the construction of by-pass roads, settlement expansion, and
construction of industrial zones. According to Law's investigations, 
Israeli authorities have confiscated 3459 dunums to construct gas
station and industrial zones in the Palestinian Kufur Qaddum, Asamou,
Jaba', Tal Mariam, Beit Sira, and Athahiriah areas. The land
confiscated in the first three months of 1999 (15147 dunums) took
place in the following areas: Ramallah (2395 dunums); Hebron (1558
dunums), Bethlehem (580 dunums), Jenin (558 dunums), Salfit & Nablus
(3,290 dunums), Tulkarem (200 dunums), Qalqilya (450 dunums),
Jerusalem (4019 dunums), Gaza (17 dunums), Rafah (50 dunums) Khan
Younis (30 dunums), and Jericho and Northern parts of the Jordan
Valley (2000 dunums).  
<P>
In March 1999, the Israeli authorities
confiscated 900 dunums of arable land in Jerusalem, in the Jaba' and
Hizma areas. More land expropriation took place the villages of
Singil, al-Mugheir, Turmusayya, al-Mazra' Asharqia and Beitin. In
Turmuayya, an estimated 10,020 dunums were confiscated for a bypass
road, expected to be 5.9 kilometres long and 80 metres wide. About
1,500 olive trees are likely to be uprooted on the village's most
fertile arable land. Over the past few weeks, the Israeli authorities
have expanded the Mihola settlement north of the Jordan valley with 16
new housing units. Some agricultural land has been added to the area
of the settlement for cultivation. This was owned by the Toubas
residents but was sealed off in 1967 due to its closeness to the
Jordanian border. The Israeli authorities have also completed
maintenance and expansion works on bypass road # 80 leading to Jericho
and Bisan in the Jordan valley. More work has been underway on 50
dunums of the Biqea' area, originally owned by the residents of
Toubas. The Israeli authorities have levelled ground in preparation
for a new settlement (Tal Sahyoun) in the village of Kufur Aqab, Jaba'
and Mukhmas. 1600 dunums of Kufur Aqab land were confiscated in 1982.
A 4 km by 20 m road expected to link the settlement of Beit Eil with
Pisgot has almost been completed. 
<P>
No Palestinian construction will be possible within 150 metres either side of the road with a loss of A
total of 12977 dunums of land have been levelled in many other areas
of the West Bank of which 12697 dunums have been levelled since the
beginning of 1999: 828 dunums in Nablus, 676 in Bethlehem, 6743 in
Ramallah, 640 in Hebron, 2180 in Jericho and the northern parts of the
Jordan valley, 15 in Jenin, 285 in Salfit, 200 in Tulkarem, 112 in
Qalqilya, 768 in Jerusalem, 50 in Rafah, and 200 in Al Mawassi & Khan
Younis.   Levelling activity reached a peak in February and March
1999, amongst villages affected were Deir Bazi', al-Janieh, Beit
Dajan, A'ba, Ein Yabroud, Shofa, Asamou', Athahirieh, Aluban
Asharqieh, Halhoul, Ein Qinia, Deir Qiddis, al-Mugheir, Qeizoun, Kufur
Qadoum, Deir al-Hattab, Jaloud, Aboud, Aluban al-Gharbia, Bani Naim,
Rantiss, Western Rafah and the area of al-Mawassi in the Gaza Strip.
<P>
The Israeli authorities have also damaged three newly-constructed
roads to cater for Palestinians villages in the Al Walaja, Al Ezaria,
and Al Aqaba areas. Work on a fourth road has been ordered to stop. In
the al-Walaja area, Israeli municipal officials threatened to disrupt
asphalt works on the only road between the village and the main road.
The road falls under the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem Municipality,
but has not had substantial repairs undertaken for many years. The
road project was carried out by the Palestinian PECDAR. And was
intended to ensure safe flow of traffic on this busy road. On 15 March
1999, officials from the municipality visited the area and hung
notices in Arabic informing the residents that the roadwork had been
carried out without licence by the competent Israeli parties.
According to the notice, the 450-metre road would be destroyed if
village residents did not appeal to the Israeli High Court within 24
hours. The road is also the residents' only route to the Palestinian
town of Beit Jala. Israeli authorities earlier tried to annex the
Walaja area and include it under their jurisdiction, but it seems that
evacuation of the area was necessary first. The authorities have also
disrupted work on a Palestinian road in the area of Abu Dis, arguing
that it was too close to bypass # 45. Thereby, placing a greater
priority on Israeli used principally for Jewish settlers use than that
for indigenous population. 
<P>
<font size=2><b>CONSTRUCTION OF BY-PASS ROADS</B></FONT>
<P>
<b>Al Khader Road # 60</b>
<P>
This road will lead to the Efrat settlement. On 28 October 1998, the
residents of Al Khader and Ortas villages received notification that
it was to be carved through their property. Work on the road began
that very day. The residents of the village had been informed about
the intention to construct a road, but had not been shown any maps.
The notification stated that residents would have until 2 November
1998 to lodge any appeals against the order. On 12 November LAW
contacted the Prosecutor requesting that residents be given sufficient
time to appeal against the confiscation of their land, but the request
was denied. Our lawyer for this case decided to appeal to the High
Court. LAW has expressed its deep concern over the Israeli
Prosecutor's delays on cases submitted by Palestinian human rights
organisations for Palestinian victims of claimed Israeli abuse. These
delays are seen by settlers as encouragement to take over Palestinian
property with the protection and support of the Israeli army and
conform with government practice. 
<P>
<b>Bypass Assera Ashimalieh</b>
<P>

 On 28
October 1998, the residents of the village of Aseera Ashimalieh
received the order # T/5/98 issued by the Central Israeli Military
Commander in which he ordered the confiscation of land plots #
34,35,36,37,and 40. The residents were informed that the land would be
used for the construction of a bypass road, 4,500 meters long and 6
meters wide. The road will link the Eibal military camp to the
settlement of Alom Moreh, leading to the Jerusalem road and the Jordan
Valley. In 1995, Israeli authorities constructed a road 8,500 meters
long linking the Eibal military camp to the settlement of Shafi
Shomron. 
<P>
<b>Bypass # 70</b><p> The paving of bypass #  70 began on 15
November 1998. An estimated 3,200 dunums of land have been confiscated
for this road, which is designed to link the settlements of Almon and
Kfar Adomim. It will cut through land belonging to Palestinian
residents of the villages of Anata and Hizma. It will be 3,200 metres
long and 100 metres wide. Confiscation of the land was carried out by
military order # 70-98/4, issued in accordance with the British
Mandate Law and the Jordanian Law of 1953 that allow the seizure of
property for the general interest. Construction of the road is
expected to be facilitated by the demolition of 20 houses along its
route. The owners of these houses have received demolition warnings.
<P>
<b>Bypass Kfar Tafouh</b><p> On 18 November 1998, Israeli authorities started
work on a bypass linking the settlement of Kfar Tafouh with the
settlement of Ele which lies to the south of Nablus. The road is
expected to cut through the villages of Yutma, Asawya and Aluban
Asharqi. <P><B>Bypass # 531</B><P> On 19 November 1998, the Israeli High
Planning Council announced the structural plan # 4/927 of road # 531.
The road is expected to cut through plots # 10,11,13 and 14 of the
land of  Kufur Qadoum, plots # 2,3,6,7,8 of the land of Gensa Fout and
plots # 5,6,9,10,11, and 15 of the village of Hijja. The road is
expected to be 4,000 meters long and 80 meters wide, and will cut
through the agricultural land of more than 50 villagers. It will link
the settlements of Kfar Qadoumim, Yakir, and Immanuel. <P><B>Bypass # 60
/ the Huwara section</b><p> On 19 November 1998, the Israeli High Planning
Council announced the structural plan # 8/901 of road # 60/ the Huwara
section. The road is expected to cut through the property of Huwara
(plots # 1,2,4,5,6,11,12,13), Beita (plots # 8,10,16), Yasouf (plots #
2,10,12,14,16), Borin (plot # 6) , and Awarta (plot # 8). <P><B>Al Aroub
Bypass</b><p> This road will link the settlement cluster of Gush Atsyoun with
the settlement of Ma'le Adomim. In order to pave the road, a 60-metre
strip of land will have to be expropriated, constituting a large
portion of Beit Ummar's agricultural land. One institution that would
be affected by the new road is the old agricultural school opposite
the village of Al Aroub. <P><B>Bypass # 45</b><p> On 21 November 1998, the
Israeli High Planning Council announced the structural plan # 1/902 of
road # 45 / Duwar Modiim section - Beit Horon hills located to the
Eastern side of the Kharbata road - Beit Sira. The road will cut
through the property of the villagers of Midya, Deir Qidis, Na'lin,
Safa, Beit Our Al Foqa, Beit Our Atihta, Bitounya, Al Jidira, and
Qalandia. The road will cut through and divide 7,000 dunums of
agricultural land and necessitate the uprooting of 250 olive trees
owned by Mahmoud Samara. As part of the 'Greater Jerusalem' projects
to expand the borders of the city - an idea adopted by the Israeli
Knesset in May 1997 - work has already begun on various projects such
as Bypass Road # 45 around the Jerusalem border, also known as the
Eastern Belt. The project will sever many Palestinian villages from
Arab East Jerusalem, such as Abu Deiss, al-Izzariah, Anata, Hizma,
al-Ziayem and Asawahra. An aerial view of the planned road shows that
its objective is to sever all Palestinian villages from Jerusalem,
while connecting the surrounding settlements located within the
Jerusalem vicinity. The Israeli company Morieh has completed the
structural plans for the bypass road, which will start at the Tapiot
junction on the Hebron - Jerusalem road. The bypass will cut through
the village of Sour Baher, extend to Qalandia in the north of
Jerusalem and finally end in Beit Shemesh, close to Lod airport.
<P>
According to information gathered by the <a href="http://www.arij.org">Applied Research Institute in
Jerusalem</a> (<a href="http://www.arij.org">ARIJ</a>), the bypass will link the proposed Har Homa
settlement with that of Ma'ale Adomim. The 45 kilometre-long road will
have 3 tunnels of 1.8 kilometres. The first will start near Abu Deiss
and extend to the village of Ziayem. The second tunnel will lie
underneath the Jerusalem - Ramallah road, cutting through Qalandia
airport in north Jerusalem. The road will destroy 700 dunums of arable
land and will cause great damage to its environment. According to
Israeli sources, the road is designed to prevent friction between
Jewish settlements and the adjacent Palestinian villages and to link
the settlements of Pisgat Ze'ev and Ma'ale Adomim. The main objective
is a sustainable regional link between settlements in the West Bank
and cities inside the green line. Since January, about 11 settlement
roads have been started at a total land cost of over 35, 690 square
metres. 
<P>
To make construction possible, the Israeli authorities have
confiscated 16,000 dunums of land; more than 38 Palestinian houses
will have to be demolished, especially in the areas of Asawahra
Asharqieh, Atori and Abu Deiss. The Israeli authorities have already
demolished 9 homes in the area, and no Palestinian construction will
be possible 300 metres from the edge of the road. 19 demolition
warnings have already been distributed in the Abu Deiss area, while in
one case the construction of an <a href="http://www.unwra.org">UNRWA</a> school (which had nearly been
completed and had obtained all the required licences) was brought to a
halt under the pretext that it was too close to a settlement road. <P><B>
By-pass # 60 ( The Ya'bad Section)</b><p> On 4 December 1998, the Israeli
High Planning Council announced the structural plan # 609 of road #
60. The road, according to a survey conducted by the Ya'bad municipal
council, is expected to cut through plots # (3-22), 15,17, (33-37),
47, 48, of the land of Ya'bad. The road is expected to be 25
kilometers long. It will start at the Salem junction in the north, and
extends south, branches at east of Shakid settlement and finishes at
the settlement of Harmish on the Jenin / Baqa main road. <P><B>
Bethlehem by-pass</b><p> The military Commander of the West Bank issued
military order # T/1/99 demanding the confiscation of land owned by
the Bethlehem and Arab Ata'amra residents, to be used for the
construction of a by-pass road. The road will be 8300 metres. 
<P><B>Road # 477 </b><p>
On 4 January 1999, the Military Commander in the West Bank issued
order # T/1/99 sanctioning the confiscation of land for a bypass road
around Bethlehem. The road will be about 8,300 metres long. On the
same date, the Israeli Civil Administration presented structural plan
# 4/966 for the construction of road # 477 cutting through the land of
Sikaka, Salfit and Kuful Haress. The road is expected to be 9,800
metres long and 60 metres wide. No construction will be permitted
closer than 80 metres away from the edge of the road. The road will
necessitate the confiscation of 2,156 dunums of some of the most
fertile land in the West Bank, which has been cultivated with
different products and is the main source of income for dozens of
families in the area.  <P><B>Nellie settlement road</b><p> On 28 February 1999,
Israeli bulldozers started construction works to build a settlement
road for the benefit of the Nellie settlement. <P><B>The Tina / Ashkalon
road</b><p>
 In Hebron, work is underway on a 7-kilometre road to link the
Tina settlement with Ashkalon town, which is inside the green line.
The road will require 920 dunums of confiscated land from the
Athahirieh village. Another road has been constructed to link the Tina
settlement with a hill seized by settlers on which 7 mobile houses
have been installed. 14. The settlement of Alon Morieh The Alon Morieh
settlers have constructed a 3 km-long road through the village of Deir
al-Hattab in the district of Nablus. The 1,180 dunums of confiscated
property belonged to the Hussein family. 
<P><B>
The Pisgot / Beit Eil Road </b><p>

The Israeli authorities have levelled ground in preparation for a new
settlement (Tal Sahyoun) in the village of Kufur Aqab, Jaba' and
Mukhmas. 1,600 dunums of Kufur Aqab land were confiscated in 1982. A 4
km by 20 m road expected to link the settlement of Beit Eil with
Pisgot has almost been completed. No Palestinian construction will be
possible within 150 metres either side of the road.

<font size=2><b>CONSTRUCTION WORKS</b></font>
<p>
During the period covered by this report, the Israeli authorities have
either begun or approved or set plans for the construction of 11,484
additional housing units Approval has already been given to build 956
housing units, and the construction of 7,008 more. Plans are underway
for another 3,520 units around the West Bank. 1999 opened with an
invitation to tender on the building of 1,500 housing units to expand
the Ofarim and Bitar Elit settlements. There has been a noticeable
increase in settlement activity in the West Bank, including East
Jerusalem, where the Israeli government has long been following a
policy of quiet deportation and ethnic cleansing in what has come to
be known as the city's 'judaization'. 
<P>
On 1 January 1999, Israeli
sources reported that the Government was to give final approval to
Ateret Kohanim (a company with a record of settlement building inside
Jerusalem), to build a new settlement in Ras al-Amoud in East
Jerusalem. An Israeli archaeological firm is currently excavating the
site, and as soon as they have finished the construction work will
commence. Also, Moskovitch the Jewish millionaire has been frank about
his intention to build an additional 70 housing units on the Beit Orot
settlement in the Mount of Olives. The Israeli Ministry of Housing is
planning the construction of 1,500 units in three settlements: Arial
(500), Alfeh Minashe (500), and Immanuel (500). In Jerusalem, plans to
add housing units to settlements have been approved as follows: 636 in
Bitar, 100 in Giv'at Hinrat, 600 in Ma'ale Adomim, 811 in Giva't Zeev,
182 in Adam and 404 in an area close to the Arab village of Sour
Baher. Already, an estimated 426 units have been added to Efrat, which
is a settlement located near Bethlehem. 
<P>
The Israeli Government has agreed to add 8 buildings to the Tal
Rumeida area in the heart of the old city of Hebron. Further approval
has been given for a four-storey building to be called 'Hashisha' and
which will stand adjacent to Beit Hadassa. On 10 March 1999, Israeli
bulldozers started levelling ground for an industrial zone in the
Athahirieh area to the south of Hebron. The zone will be under the
control of the Shama' settlement. A road has already been constructed
to link the settlement with the foreseen industrial zone.  
<P>
<font size=2><b>UPROOTING TREES</b></font></a>
<p>
Supported by Israeli soldiers, settlers have uprooted 7,695 trees of
different kinds: 580 in Ramallah, 1200 in Hebron, 3,595 in Nablus,
1,200 in Jenin, 500 in Bethlehem, 150 in Salfit, 75 in Tulkarem, 80 in
Qalqilya, 230 in Jerusalem and 85 in Gaza. The Shilo and Rachel
settlers have uprooted 120 trees in the nearby Palestinian village of
Ein Jaloud, Nablus district. They also stopped Abu Arakhim and Abu
al-Kasir village residents from cultivating their land in the Asahla
valley.  On 16 January 1999, a group of settlers destroyed the trees
in the Qana valley owned by 4 residents of Kufur Thulth. The land was
reclaimed by the owners in cooperation with the Agricultural Relief
Committee, made arable and planted with various types of crop. A water
reservoir built only 3 months ago was destroyed and 700 new plants
were damaged. Settlers from Beit Ari raided the Aboud village and
damaged the property of Hanna Khoury, uprooting 42 olive trees and
totally destroying 2 dunums of arable land. 
<P>
Settlers from Bni Haifar near Hebron uprooted 1,000 olive trees and
damaged the fence around the land. They obtained an order to
confiscate 20 dunums of the village property in order to expand the
settlement. About 30 families incurred financial losses after the
raid. On 18 March 1999, settlers from the eastern part of Hebron
uprooted 200 trees and destroyed fences around the land. On 1 March
1999, settlers from the Rachel settlement uprooted 440 olive trees and
set fire to 20 dunums of cultivated land. On 9 March, settlers from
Hebron uprooted 200 trees in Beir al-Abeed, al-Qaizoun and al-Baqa'.
The Alon settlers uprooted 1,500 trees in Deir al-Hattab near Nablus. 
<P><img align="right" src="setprot.jpg">
<font size=2><b>SETTLER ASSAULT</b></font>
<P>
On 1 February 1999, residents of a settlement near Jerusalem assaulted
a number of Palestinian in the Mount of Olives and Wadi Joz, beating
them up and smashing the windscreens of a number of cars parked in the
area. On 5 January, settlers ran amok in the old city of Hebron and
threatened Palestinians in the vicinity, throwing stones at Arab
houses and passers-by. On 8 January 1999, settlers in the Gush Qatif
area of the Gaza Strip sealed off the main exit to the road linking
Rafah to Deir al-Balah and banned the entry of Palestinian cars. In
Rafah, Moraj settlers sealed off the roads leading to various
Palestinian agricultural areas, prevented Palestinians from passing to
reach their places of work. Israeli soldiers leveled 2 dunums of land
and established a military camp. On 15 January, a taxi driver, Haitham
Arajoub, was assaulted and injured at the Kiryat Jad junction as he
was returning home. On 20 January, settlers continued with their
assault on the old city of Hebron. 
<P>
<font size=2><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font>
<p>
The existence of Israeli settlements contravenes the Fourth Geneva
Convention which demands the occupier of foreign land to refrain from
undertaking any procedures meant to change the status quo of the
occupied territories, including the transfer of its civilians. 
<P>
The actions also contravene with UNSC resolutions and the bilateral
signed agreements. Such unilateral Israeli practices breach the Wye
Agreement. The provisions related to unilateral actions state the
following: "Recognising the necessity to create a positive
environment for negotiations, neither side shall initiate or take
any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip in accordance with the Interim Agreement." 
<P>
The Israeli Government, whether through the statements of Ministers
encouraging settlers to 'take over the hills in the West Bank', or
through official approval for the expansion of settlements, is
violating the general provisions and terms of the Wye River
Agreement. 
<P>
Furthermore, these procedures violate the Cairo Agreements of May
1994, which in the preamble reaffirm " their understanding that the
interim self-government arrangements, including the arrangements to
apply in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area contained in this
Agreement, are an integral part of the whole peace process and that
the negotiations on the permanent status will lead to the
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338." 
<P>
It is clear that the unilateral actions taken by the Israeli
Government will not lead to the implementation of Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, and will not cause the agreement's
deadlines to be met, but will rather perpetuate the occupation. In
relation to the permanent status negotiations the agreement states:
"The two sides will immediately resume permanent status negotiations
on an accelerated basis and will make a determined effort to achieve
the mutual goal of reaching an agreement by May 4, 1999. The
negotiations will be continuous and without interruption. The US has
expressed its willingness to facilitate these negotiations." 
<P>
Not only do Israeli procedures violate the legitimate political
rights of the Palestinian people, they also take over their property,
threatening their security and life. The construction of bypass roads
will devour Palestinian agricultural land, the source of their pride
and living. Furthermore, the roads will necessitate the demolition of
hundreds of Palestinian houses and the dislocation of hundreds of
families. Israeli forces have been preventing residents from
cultivating the land adjacent to their houses. Many people have been
detained because of their attempts to cultivate their own land, and
water supplies to the neighbourhood have been cut off. 
<P>
Settlers have also been known to attack residents of the same
neighbourhood. This appears to be part of an orchestrated attempt to
threaten the Palestinian community in an effort to make way for
settlement expansion. 
<P>
The prohibitions stipulated in Wye did not stop Israel's Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon from calling on settlers to "take over the
hills of the West Bank before it is too late". A public statement of
this nature by a minister of the Israeli Government can only be
viewed as official encouragement to settlers to carry out unilateral
action in disregard of international law and the agreements signed by
their own government. Additional efforts must be undertaken 
immeidately to stop the violation of law and life.
