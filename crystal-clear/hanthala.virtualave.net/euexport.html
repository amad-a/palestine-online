<b>Exports to the European Community of Goods from Israeli Settlements</b>
<p>
<img align="right" src="nooo.jpg">
Article 38 of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement on Trade and
Trade-related matters specifies that it applies to the
territory of the Member States of the European Community and
"to the territory of the State of Israel". No further
definition of that notion is contained in the Agreement or
was made in the context of its signature. The territorial
scope of application of the 1995 Association Agreement,
currently under ratification, is defined under identical
terms.
<P>
The question arises whether Israeli settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights
are part of the State of Israel. Israel has unilaterally
annexed both East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and thus,
as a matter of Israeli law, they form part of the State of
Israel. For Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which have not been formally annexed, Israeli
jurisdiction applies in practice.
<P>
However, the international community and international
public law take a different view. All relevant United
Nations Security Council Resolutions lead to the conclusion
that neither Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, nor East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, can be
considered as part of the State of Israel. In addition, the
UN General Assembly has adopted many resolutions on the same
matters that go beyond the Security Council positions.
<P>
Even if not adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter,
these United Nations Security Council resolutions may be
regarded as legally binding, or at least as an authoritative
interpretation of international law. In addition the
European Union has consistently endorsed the principles
enshrined in all relevant Security Council resolutions,
notably in the 1980 Venice declaration, the October 1996
Luxembourg Council declaration, the December 1996
declaration of the Dublin European Council and the June 1997
Amsterdam "Call for Peace".
<P>
Pending a permanent status solution it must therefore be
concluded that the territorial scope of application of the
EC-Israel Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related
matters is limited to Israel's pre-1967 borders, thus
leaving out Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and the unilaterally annexed areas of East Jerusalem
and the Golan Heights.
<P>
Given this, the EC-Israel Agreement covers neither exports
originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip nor exports originating in East Jerusalem and the
Golan Heights. Preferential access for such exports would
contravene the Protocol on rules of origin annexed to the
agreement.
<P>
The Commission has grounds to believe that these violations
are taking place at present. In this respect, the European
Community should take steps to verify the accuracy of this
information according to the procedures of the EC-Israel
Interim Agreement.
<P>
Should the violation be confirmed, the European Community
should take action to bring them to an end.
<P>
According to the international community and international
public law including all relevant UN Security Council
Resolutions, neither Israeli settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, nor East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
are part of the State of Israel. The European Union has
constantly held this position.
<hr>
Preferential access to Community markets for exports
originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, on the one hand, and in East Jerusalem and the Golan
Heights, on the other, would contravene agreed rules of
origin.
<P>
There are indications that these violations are currently
taking place. The European Community should take steps to
verify the accuracy of this information according to the
procedures of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement. If such
violations of the rules of origin should confirmed they
should be brought to an end.
<P>
<font size=2><b>EXPORTS TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY OF GOODS FROM THE WEST
BANK AND GAZA STRIP</b></font>
<P>
As explained above, for the time being the EC-Israel Interim
Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters does not allow
diagonal cumulation of origin with other Mediterranean
partners.
<P>
<b>A) Legal background</b>
<P>
In October 1986 the Community first granted a preferential
trade regime to products originating in the territories
occupied by Israel. The purpose of these measures was to
rectify an anomaly whereby all the surrounding countries
enjoyed preferential access to the Community market while
the Occupied Territories did not. As there was no authority
with which an agreement could be signed the Community's
measures had to be unilateral. The Palestinian Chambers of
Commerce in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were the
authorities chosen to issue the necessary certificates of
origin.
<P>
Considerable difficulties were encountered in implementing
the trade regime since Israel opposed the establishment of a
procedure whereby exports from the Occupied Territories
could effectively take place. In December 1987 Israel
accepted the principle of direct agricultural exports to
Europe. However, Israel did not sign an agreement with
Palestinian producers on export procedures until October
1988, following European Parliament's strong pressure in
this respect. In fact, the European Parliament opposed the
approval of the protocols adapting the Co-operation
Agreement and the Fifth Financial Protocol between the
Community and Israel until the latter, in practice, accepted
export procedures for Palestinian goods.
<P>
<b>EC-PLO Interim Association Agreement</b>
<P>
Trade relations between the European Community and the
Palestinians were further institutionalised by the signing
and entry into force on 1 July 1997 of the EC-PLO Interim
Association Agreement on Trade and Co-operation for the
benefit of the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. In practice, however, full implementation of the
Agreement is not feasible unless Israel allows it to take
place.
<P>
The Luxembourg European Council on 12-13 December 1997
"reiterated its determination to work, including through the
joint dialogue with Israel, towards the removal of obstacles
to Palestinian economic development and to facilitate the
free movement of people and goods. It also stressed the need
for the comprehensive implementation of the EC-PLO Interim
Agreement."
<P>
According to Article 73 of the EC-PLO Interim Agreement it
applies to the territory of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
East Jerusalem remains covered by the preferential trade
agreement unilaterally granted by the European Community in
1986 and not formally repealed.
<P>
Protocol 3 of the EC-PLO Interim Association Agreement
contains similar rules of origin to the ones contained in
the EC-Israel Interim Agreement. According to Article 16(4)
the movement certificate EUR. 1 is to be issued by the
customs authorities of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By
providing that the origin certificates are to be issued by
the Palestinian Customs Authorities the EC-PLO Interim
Agreement includes new responsibilities on customs
administration for the Palestinian Authority.
<P>
<b>The Paris Protocol</b>
<P>
The Protocol on, signed in Paris 1994
(the Paris Protocol) constitutes Annex V of the 1995 Interim
Agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and
establishes the contractual arrangements that shall govern
economic relations between the two parties.
<P>
Article I(4) defines its geographical scope of application
according to which the term "Areas" means the areas under
the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority which may have
to be adjusted in accordance with the Interim Agreement. The
definition of what can be considered areas under Palestinian
jurisdiction is ambiguous but should refer to what is known
as Areas A and B. The Protocol does not include such a
territorial definition of Israel for its scope of
application.
<P>
Imports: The Paris Protocol was in large measure predicated
on allowing the Palestinians to import what they consume.
According to Article III of the Paris Protocol the
Palestinians will have all powers and responsibilities in
the spheres of import and customs policy and procedures for
specific goods (Lists A1, A2 and B). For all other products,
the Israeli rates of customs, purchase tax, levies, excises
and other charges shall serve as a minimum basis for the
Palestinian Authority. Thus, the Palestinian Authority may
decide higher import tariffs than Israel across all products
but lower import tariffs only on products from Lists A1, A2
and B.
<P>
Exports: According to Article VIII(11) and Article IX(6) of
the Protocol, the Palestinians should have the right to
export their agricultural and industrial produce to external
markets without restrictions, on the basis of certificates
of origin issued by the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore,
Palestinian imports and exports through the points of exit
and entry in Israel should be given equal trade and economic
treatment (Article III(13)).
<P>
<b>Compatibility between the Paris Protocol and the EC-PLO
Interim Agreement</b>
<P>
Israel has called into question the legitimacy of the EC-PLO
Interim Agreement. Israel has claimed that the EC-PLO
Agreement does not respect the notion of a single
Israel-Palestinian territory that, according to the Israeli
interpretation, is established through the Paris Protocol.
<P>
Even if Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip de facto
apply the similar import regimes, a legal interpretation of
the Paris Protocol leads to the conclusion that the West
Bank and Gaza Strip constitutes a separate customs territory
since the Palestinians can and do exercise their own trade
regime. In addition, Israel puts important barriers to the
free movement of goods and does not grant Palestinian
exporters trade and economic treatment on an equal footing.
<P>
Furthermore, by concluding the EC-PLO Interim Association
Agreement the EU acknowledges that it is dealing with an
economic entity, separate from Israel. The Agreement was
negotiated with reference to Article 9 of the Interim
Agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, which
stipulates that the PLO may conduct negotiations and sign
agreements for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority in
the case of, inter alia, economic agreements.
<P>
<b>B) Alleged violations of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement on
Trade and Trade-related matters</b>
<P>
There is evidence that many products produced wholly, or
substantially processed, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
are being exported into the European Community as Israeli
originating products.
<P>
One of the major producers of cut flowers in the Gaza Strip
exports his production under Israeli certificates of origin
(EUR1) through Agrexco, Israel's agency for exports of
non-citrus products. He does so in order to avoid the risk
of damage and delay to his products as a result of Israeli
treatment of Palestinian produce at Israeli outlets.
<P>
One of the unintended consequences of the orange juice case
with Israel at the Co-operation Council in November 1997 has
been that Agrexco, working with the Israeli Flower Board,
has been reported as requiring Palestinian cut flowers
producers to deposit a sum equal to the 14% duty - described
as "Palestinian Authority tax" - that would be charged by
the European Community if the practice of exporting these
flowers as Israeli originating would be discovered.
<P>
Examples of other products exported for similar reasons
through Agrexco include strawberries and aubergines. It is
likely that Palestinian produce is mixed with Israeli
produce; products from both sources are then exported
together.
<P>
The situation is similar for citrus fruit, oranges and
lemons, through the operation of the Israeli Citrus
Marketing Board.
<P>
In the case of processed food - for example pickles or fruit
juice - there are documented instances in which the Israeli
exporting agent does nothing but stick a "Made in Israel"
label on Palestinian products; all packaging is done by the
Palestinian producer.
<P>

In the case of industrial goods, examples exist in the shoes
and leather and garments sectors. Typically, an Israeli
company will import textiles or other materials from the
European Community. A Palestinian company will then process
this material. Under bilateral cumulation arrangements, the
resulting products should then be exported as Palestinian
originating, but are in fact exported as originating in
Israel. The Israeli exporter charges for his export
services, thus reducing the return to the Palestinian
subcontractor.
<P>

Only some Palestinian products have been known to have been
exported directly into the European Community market. Others
have been exported- in small quantities- with a Palestinian
certificate of origin through Israeli commercial channels.
<P>

Israeli-imposed restrictions on the Palestinian economy
inevitably lead to violations of both the EC-PLO and the
EC-Israel Interim Agreements. In addition, these
restrictions do not allow the implementation of the EC-PLO
Interim Association Agreement for which Israel's
co-operation is necessary in practice.
<P>

The main obstacles preventing trade between the European
Community and the Palestinians could be summarised as
follows:
<P>
<b>Imports</b>
<P>

Imports from the outside world, including the EU (for which
preferential treatment is granted by the agreements with
both the Israelis and the Palestinians), into the West Bank
and Gaza Strip are suffering from Israeli practices. These
practices do not allow imports to be treated according to
the agreements signed by the parties.

<P>
Israeli port and airport authorities have required all
Palestinian importers to sign a pledge, under pain of legal
proceedings, that imports from the European Community will
be sold only in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Whilst this
could be theoretically understandable where differences in
tariffs exist, it must be stressed that a similar pledge is
not required form Israeli importers. In fact, it appears
that the reason is to protect the Israeli importing agent
for the same product.

<P>
Import licences are often not granted, or are delayed, by
the Israeli authorities. This happens for example in the
case of imports to the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the
purpose of making up finished products, for domestic
consumption or export (for example paints or pharmaceuticals
from Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and others). In order
to fulfil the terms of his deal, the Palesp
whas difficulties obtaining a licence, agrees to import
the products without a licence and to pay a 5% fine.

<P>
The reason given by the Israeli authorities for not granting
a licence is often that products fail to meet standards,
even though the same product is imported to Israel by an
Israeli agent without problem. In other cases, the standards
cited do not even exist in Israeli import regulations. Often
the same products are allowed through at a later date when
the Israeli agent - or the Israeli producer of the same
product - finds himself unable to supply the market.
<P>

It can be assumed that these practices occur in order to
protect Israeli agents or producers. The effect is to reduce
the potential for the development of direct trade relations
between the European Community and the Palestinians; the
Palestinian importer is advised to work with an Israeli
agent.

<P>
One consequence of Palestinian importers having to use an
Israeli agent is that the consumer price is higher than if
the import involved only one agent. This reduces the
competitive advantage of European Community products in the
Palestinian market.
<P>

Another consequence is that the Palestinian Authority's
Ministry of Finance forgoes purchase tax. In the case of
direct imports - through a Palestinian agent - purchase tax
and VAT revert to the Palestinian Authority. In the case of
indirect imports - through an Israeli agent - the Israeli
authorities transfer VAT to the Palestinian Authority, but
retain the purchase tax and customs duties where applicable.

<P>
In general terms, Israeli customs have a tendency not to
accept imports marked as exempted from duty under the EC-PLO
Agreement. Importers are obliged either to alter the
paperwork to show that the products are exempted under the
EC-Israel Agreement - which delays the import - or to pay
duty to Israeli customs. This is because the Israeli
authorities do not recognise the EC-PLO Agreement.

<P>
<b>Exports</b>
<P>

There is a tendency to contract Israeli exporters, which is
doubtless reinforced by the knowledge that Palestinian
exporters run the risk of their exports being subject to
obstacles if the attempt is made to export their products
directly to the EU.

<P>
Palestinian products are subject to security checks three or
four times on their route from the West Bank or Gaza Strip
to Israeli outlets. Security checking of Palestinian exports
- and imports - often damage and delay Palestinian traded
products and make them costlier. Palestinian producers thus
gain a bad reputation with their European partners.

<P>
Palestinian perishable agricultural products need to be
stored correctly, but they are often not stored in the
proper refrigerated facilities.

<P>
For exports in general, priority is given to Israeli
shipments at the Ashdod and Ben Gurion cargo facilities.
This is particularly damaging in the case of perishable
products. Also, Palestinian exporters have to pay higher
cargo handling charges than those charged to Israeli
exporters using the same facility.

<P>
The table below shows that for some products there is an
important difference between the use of the quotas (granted
by the agreements with the EC) by Israel and the
Palestinians for the same period of time.
<P>

<P>
<b>Free transit to, from and through Israel</b>
<P>


Until the Palestinians have free access to the outside world
- particularly through the Gaza airport and harbour - it is
even more crucial that Israel facilitates the free movement
of Palestinian goods through its territory.
<P>

Israel imposes heavy restrictions that have the effect of
making Palestinian imports and exports both more complicated
and costlier than those carried out by Israeli traders.
<P>

There are draconian restrictions imposed by Israel at all
times on entry and exit of both people and merchandise
originating in or sent to Gaza. This applies occasionally to
the West Bank Palestinian-held areas as well (the so-called
"internal-closure"). In recent years, trade fell
dramatically as a result of repeated closures and high
transaction costs at the border. Merchandise exports were
cut by nearly half (from 11 to 6% of GDP) between 1992 and
1995. Imports also fell, from 46 to 38% of GDP over the same
period
<P>

Furthermore, the lack of a fully operational Palestinian
customs administration also reinforces the difficulties
properly implementing the EC-PLO Interim Agreement. To this
effect the Community in November 1997 approved a technical
assistance project on customs administration to be
implemented in 1998 (total amount of 1.2 MECU). This project
is considered to be a first phase for future technical
assistance on this issue (as requested by the PA). The
Commission is ready to provide all necessary technical
assistance in order to facilitate the creation of a sound
customs administration, capable of implementing the
agreement should the Israeli obstacles allow it in the
future.

<P>
The Community decided in 1986 to grant preferential trade
regime for products originating in territories occupied by
Israel. Israel only allowed its implementation in 1988
following strong European Parliament pressure.
<hr>

The Interim Association Agreement between the EC and the PLO
was concluded on the basis of the provisions in the 1995
Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement that allow the PLO to
conduct and sign agreements for the benefit of the PA in the
sphere of economic co-operation. The EC-PLO Agreement
entered into force on 1 July 1997.

<P>
Israeli-imposed obstacles on the Palestinian economy lead to
both Israeli and Palestinian violations of the EC-Israel
Agreement, given that the increased difficulties imposed
upon Palestinian exporters to export directly into the
European Community drive them to export their produce as
originating in Israel and to declare their imports as if
destined for Israel.
<P>

Furthermore, Israeli-imposed obstacles on Palestinian free
trade with the rest of the world impede Palestinian economic
development and the full implementation of the EC-PLO
agreement.

<P>
Evidence suggests that the practices of exporting
Palestinian products as "made in Israel" under Israeli
certificates of origin apply to a substantial proportion of
total exports into the European Community of Palestinian
originating products.

<P>
Preferential access to Community markets for exports
originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as originating
in Israel under the EC-Israel Interim Trade Agreement, is a
violation of the latter given that it does not apply to
these territories.
<P>
<font size=2><b>PROPOSALS</b></font>
<P>


Two obstacles remain in the way of correct implementation of
the EC-Israel Interim Agreement. Both refer to exports to
the European Community of products as if originating in
Israel whilst effectively producedin:
<hr>
<b>1) Israeli settlements, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights</b>
<P>

Preferential access to Community markets for exports
originating in Israeli settlemin the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, on thone hand, and in East Jerusalem and the Golan
Heights, on the other, contravenes agreed rules of origin
since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel
under public international law.

<P>
There are indications that these exports are currently
taking place. The European Community will take steps to
verify the accuracy of this information according to the
procedures that have been agreed with Israel as follow-up to
the Co-operation Committee of November 1997. Should it be
confirmed, such violations of the rules of origin should be
brought to an end.
<P>

<b>2) the West Bank and Gaza Strip</b>
<P>

Preferential access to Community markets for exports
originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as if
originating in Israel under the EC-Israel Interim Agreement
is in violation of the latter given that it does not apply
to these territories.
<P>

There is ample evidence that these exports are currently
taking place. The European Community will take steps to
verify the accuracy of this information according to the
procedures that have been agreed with Israel as follow-up to
the Co-operation Committee. Should these violations of the
Protocol on rules of origin be confirmed they should be
brought to an end.
