	<td><i><span style="font-size:14"><br></span></i><b><i><span style="font-size:14">Excerpts from an e-mail from Rachel on February 7, 2003.</span></b></i><i><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>I have been in Palestine for two weeks and one hour now, and I still <br>have&nbsp; very few words to describe what I see.&nbsp; It is most difficult for me to <br>think about what's going on here when I sit down to write back to the United <br>States--something about the virtual portal into luxury.&nbsp; I don't know <br>if many of the children here have ever existed without tank-shell holes in <br>their walls and the towers of an occupying army surveying them <br>constantly from the near horizons.&nbsp; I think, although I'm not entirely <br>sure, that even the smallest of these children understand that life is not <br>like this everywhere.&nbsp; An eight-year-old was shot and killed by an Israeli <br>tank two days before I got here, and many of the children murmur his name to <br>me, “Ali”--or point at the posters of him on the walls.&nbsp; The children <br>also love to get me to practice my limited Arabic by asking me &quot;Kaif <br>Sharon?&quot; <br> &quot;Kaif Bush?&quot; and they laugh when I say &quot;Bush Majnoon&quot; &quot;Sharon <br>Majnoon&quot; back in my limited Arabic.&nbsp; (How is Sharon?&nbsp; How is Bush? <br>Bush is crazy.&nbsp; Sharon is crazy.)&nbsp; Of course this isn't quite what I <br>believe, and some of the adults who have the English correct me: Bush <br>mish Majnoon... Bush is a businessman.&nbsp; Today I tried to learn to say <br>&quot;Bush is a tool&quot;, but I don't think it translated quite right.&nbsp; But <br>anyway, there are eight-year-olds here much more aware of the workings of the <br>global power structure than I was just a few years ago--at least <br>regarding Israel.<br><br>Nevertheless, I think about the fact that no amount of reading, <br>attendance at conferences, documentary viewing and word of mouth <br>could have prepared me for the reality of the situation here.&nbsp; You just <br>can't imagine it unless you see it, and even then you are always well <br>aware that your experience is not at all the reality: what with the <br>difficulties the Israeli Army would face if they shot an unarmed US <br>citizen, and with the fact that I have money to buy water when the army <br>destroys wells, and, of course, the fact that I have the option of <br>leaving.&nbsp; <br>Nobody in my family has been shot, driving in their car, by a rocket <br>launcher from a tower at the end of a major street in my hometown.&nbsp; I <br>have a home.&nbsp; I am allowed to go see the ocean.&nbsp; Ostensibly it is still <br>quite difficult for me to be held for months or years on end without a <br>trial (this because I am a white US citizen, as opposed to so many others).&nbsp; <br>When I leave for school or work I can be relatively certain that there <br>will not be a heavily armed soldier waiting half way between Mud Bay and <br>downtown Olympia at a checkpoint—a soldier with the power to decide <br>whether I can go about my business, and whether I can get home again <br>when I'm done.&nbsp; So, if I feel outrage at arriving and entering briefly <br>and incompletely into the world in which these children exist, I wonder <br>conversely about how it would be for them to arrive in my world.&nbsp; <br> <br>They know that children in the United States don't usually have their <br>parents shot and they know they sometimes get to see the ocean.&nbsp; But <br>once you have seen the ocean and lived in a silent place, where water <br>is taken for granted and not stolen in the night by bulldozers, and once <br>you have spent an evening when you haven’t wondered if the walls of your <br>home might suddenly fall inward waking you from your sleep, and once <br>you’ve met people who have never lost anyone-- once you have <br>experienced the reality of a world that isn't surrounded by murderous <br>towers, tanks, armed &quot;settlements&quot; and now a giant metal wall, I wonder <br>if you can forgive the world for all the years of your childhood spent <br>existing--just existing--in resistance to the constant stranglehold of <br>the world’s fourth largest military--backed by the world’s only <br>superpower--in it’s attempt to erase you from your home.&nbsp; That is something I wonder <br>about these children.&nbsp; I wonder what would happen if they really knew.<br><br>As an afterthought to all this rambling, I am in Rafah, a city of about <br>140,000 people, approximately 60 percent of whom are refugees--many <br>of whom are twice or three times refugees.&nbsp; Rafah existed prior to <br>1948, <br>but most of the people here are themselves or are descendants of people <br>who were relocated here from their homes in historic Palestine--now <br>Israel.&nbsp; Rafah was split in half when the Sinai returned to Egypt.&nbsp; <br>Currently, the Israeli army is building a fourteen-meter-high wall <br>between Rafah in Palestine and the border, carving a no-mans land from the <br>houses along the border.&nbsp; Six hundred and two homes have been <br>completely bulldozed according to the Rafah Popular Refugee <br>Committee.&nbsp; The number of homes that have been partially destroyed is <br>greater.<br><br>Today as I walked on top of the rubble where homes once stood, <br>Egyptian soldiers called to me from the other side of the border, &quot;Go! <br>Go!&quot; because a tank was coming.&nbsp; Followed by waving and &quot;what's your <br>name?&quot;.&nbsp; There is something disturbing about this friendly curiosity.&nbsp; <br>It <br>reminded me of how much, to some degree, we are all kids curious <br>about other kids: Egyptian kids shouting at strange women wandering <br>into the path of tanks.&nbsp; Palestinian kids shot from the tanks when they <br>peak out from behind walls to see what's going on.&nbsp; International kids <br>standing in front of tanks with banners.&nbsp; Israeli kids in the tanks <br>anonymously, occasionally shouting-- and also occasionally waving--<br>many forced to be here, many just aggressive, shooting into the houses <br>as we wander away.<br><br> In addition to the constant presence of tanks along the border and in <br>the western region between Rafah and settlements along the coast, there are <br>more IDF towers here than I can count--along the horizon,at the end of <br>streets.&nbsp; Some just army green metal.&nbsp; Others these strange spiral <br>staircases draped in some kind of netting to make the activity within <br>anonymous.&nbsp; Some hidden,just beneath the horizon of buildings.&nbsp; A new <br>one went up the other day in the time it took us to do laundry and to <br>cross town twice to hang banners.&nbsp; Despite the fact that some of the <br>areas nearest the border are the original Rafah with families who have <br>lived on this land for at least a century, only the 1948 camps in the <br>center of the city are Palestinian controlled areas under Oslo.&nbsp; But as <br>far as I can tell, there are few if any places that are not within the <br>sights of some tower or another.&nbsp; Certainly there is no place invulnerable to <br>apache helicopters or to the cameras of invisible drones we hear <br>buzzing over the city for hours at a time.<br><br>I've been having trouble accessing news about the outside world here, <br>but I hear an escalation of war on Iraq is inevitable.&nbsp; There is a great <br>deal of concern here about the &quot;reoccupation of Gaza.&quot;&nbsp; Gaza is reoccupied <br>every day to various extents, but I think the fear is that the tanks <br>will enter all the streets and remain here, instead of entering some of the <br>streets and then withdrawing after some hours or days to observe and <br>shoot from the edges of the communities.&nbsp; If people aren't already <br>thinking about the consequences of this war for the people of the <br>entire region then I hope they will start.&nbsp; <br><br>I also hope you'll come here.&nbsp; We've been wavering between five and six <br>internationals.&nbsp; The neighborhoods that have asked us for some form of <br>presence are Yibna, Tel El Sultan, Hi Salam, Brazil, Block J, Zorob, <br>and Block O.&nbsp; There is also need for constant night-time presence at a well <br>on the outskirts of Rafah&nbsp; since the Israeli army destroyed the two <br>largest wells.&nbsp; According to the municipal water office the wells <br>destroyed last week provided half of Rafah’s water supply. Many of the <br>communities have requested internationals to be present at night to <br>attempt to shield houses from further demolition.&nbsp; After about ten p.m. <br>it is very difficult to move at night because the Israeli army treats <br>anyone in the streets as resistance and shoots at them.&nbsp; So clearly we are too <br>few.<br><br>I continue to believe that my home, Olympia, could gain a lot and offer <br>a lot by deciding to make a commitment to Rafah in the form of a sister-<br>community relationship.&nbsp; Some teachers and children's groups have <br>expressed interest in e-mail exchanges, but this is only the tip of the <br>iceberg of solidarity work that might be done.&nbsp; Many people want their <br>voices to be heard, and I think we need to use some of our privilege as <br>internationals to get those voices heard directly in the US, rather <br>than through the filter of well-meaning internationals such as myself.&nbsp; I am <br>just beginning to learn, from what I expect to be a very intense tutelage, <br>about the ability of people to organize against all odds, and to resist <br>against all odds.</span></i></td>
