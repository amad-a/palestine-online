It looks as though the route taken by this fence is partly on a basis of<br><br>security and partly on a basis of what land is available,&quot; he said.<br>&quot;That is unacceptable&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Conjoined with a fence around Jerusalem, another seven percent of the<br>West Bank will be annexed by this fence,&quot; he said.<br><br>Around 70,000 Palestinians would be trapped between the new barrier and<br>the 1967 &quot;green line&quot; border between Israel and the West Bank, putting<br>pressure on them to leave their homes, he said.<br><br>&quot;It is unacceptable and we shall be making representations to the<br>government of Israel about it,&quot; Straw said.<br><br><br><br>Officials said junior Foreign Office Minister Mike O'Brien met Israel's <br>ambassador to London shortly after Straw's comments, and might have<br>raised the issue with him then.<br><br>Israel says the fence is designed to prevent infiltration by Palestinian<br>suicide bombers into Israel.<br><br><br><br><br>Straw's sharp criticism came just hours after Israeli Prime Minister<br>Ariel Sharon called early elections, heralding three months of political<br>turmoil in Israel and deepening uncertainty in the Middle East ahead of a<br>possible U.S.-led war on Iraq.<br><br>Officials said Britain wanted to head off perceptions that efforts to<br>end two years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be put on hold until a<br>new Israeli government emerged.<br><br>&quot;There remains a sense of urgency to break the logjam,&quot; one official<br>told Reuters. Straw said the possibility of military action in Iraq -- likely<br>to inflame Arab opinion -- made the need for an Israeli-Palestinian deal all the greater.<br><br>Condemning the expansion of Israeli settlements across the West Bank,<br>Straw said they now covered 41 percent of the territory and encircled Arab<br>East Jerusalem.<br><br>&quot;These are illegal settlements. It is wholly wrong that the government<br>of Israel should have continued to extend them,&quot; he said. &quot;This is<br>unlawful.&quot;<br>By making it more difficult to set up a viable Palestinian state, they<br>were also undermining Israeli security, he said.<br><br>The international community regards the Israeli settlements as illegal<br>under international law. Israel disputes this.</span></td>
