Here, too, people were angry at the armed men but could do nothing to keep them away. Riad Hashash, 19, who stood at the entrance to the Balata camp, was killed when soldiers shot at him. Altogether five were killed in the demonstrations. </span></font></b></i></a><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>At 2 A.M. in Ramallah, several people were still roaming the dark streets, soaked with tear gas and filled with smoke, too worked up to go to sleep. <br><br>Below is the link to yesterday's UN resolution that Israel will<br>arrogantly ignore and the world will quickly file away with no action.<br>Also, there is a UN report on our sad economic situation.&nbsp; Among<br>other news items is a last item about Sharons Wall...well worth the<br>read.<br><br>Under a collapsing curfew,</span></font></b></td>
