	<td><span style="font-size:14">On Monday, November 24, Israeli soldiers <br>ordered a young resident of the town of Nablus to strip completely <br>naked in the street, according to Palestinian witnesses. <br><br>Yasser Sharar, 25, was caught violating the curfew in Nablus and was <br>stopped by Israeli soldiers at gunpoint, who immediately ordered him <br>to remove his clothes. <br><br>In an interview with Reuters, a witness explained, They forced Yasser <br>to take off all his clothes including his underwear they ordered him <br>to walk like a dog and then he burst into tears,<br><br>The eyewitness who watched the scene from a few meters away <br>continued,;He kept crying and was in a very stressful situation many <br>residents, including women watched him and he was very embarrassed<br>Israeli soldiers refuted the claim, saying that they merely asked him <br>to lift his shirt, but he voluntarily removed all his clothing to get <br>media attention. The Reuters report also claimed that this is the <br>first time Israeli soldiers have ordered Palestinians to completely <br>strip naked publicly in a security operation. <br><br>However, recent interviews conducted by the Palestine Chronicle with <br>scores of residents of the Jenin refugee camp contradicted the <br>Reuters claim. Dozens of residents of the refugee camp claimed that <br>during the Israeli invasion of April, 2002, it was a common practice <br>to force residents to strip naked as a form of humiliation, or as the <br>Israelis say, a security operation.<br><br>Nael Ammar, 43, is a resident of the Jenin refugee camp and explains <br>how Israeli soldiers arrested and detained scores of men from the <br>refugee camp, and forced many to strip naked, We were mostly older <br>people, sick and wounded. We had nine handicapped people with us, <br>three were from the same family, sons of Abu Ibrahim. Some of us were <br>too old, they were senile. When they told them go left they would go <br>right, but they stripped them naked anyway. I tried to help them as <br>much as I could. I was the only one who spoke Hebrew. Close to us was <br>a group of young men. They were handcuffed, naked and lying on their <br>stomachs. The Israeli tanks would pass by them so fast, only forty <br>centimeters away from their heads.<br><br>Nawal Hawashin, a mother of eight, told Palestine Chronicle reporters <br>that they threatened her 18 year old son with death if he did not <br>follow their orders to strip naked. They ordered my son and other <br>young men to take off all their clothes and throw them on the ground. <br>The soldiers warned that if the boys made any move, they would be <br>shot. Near the Sahah, there was a body of a man with a white beard. <br>He was lying dead on the ground, and tanks were rolling right over <br>him. I couldn't recognize him. My son Mohammed said, ;Mother, I am <br>too ashamed to take my clothes off in front of women. I told him, <br>Son, this is our fate. <br><br>Jamal Hussein has a family of thirteen. A man who worked as a cheap <br>laborer in Israel before the invasion of Jenin described in detail <br>how terrified Jenin residents were gathered in the center of the camp <br>and forced to undress. Soldiers stationed on the top of a nearby <br>house started throwing dirt on us.. We remained 15 men and boys. Half <br>an hour later a tank came and stood near us. They pointed the canon <br>at us. And they spent over an hour terrifying us that way. The <br>commander of that unit spoke in Arabic to us. Go to Saha. While we <br>were on our way, we kept reading Koran. We felt that they were going <br>to execute us. Once we arrived there, we found a large number of men, <br>forced to strip completely naked. There was a big pile of clothes. <br>Soldiers started shooting right above our heads, they would call on <br>us, one by one. Once they pointed at you, you would have to pull your <br>pants down and your shirt up, when it was my turn, as I stood up, I <br>noticed the body of a man, Jamal Sab!<br>bagh. It was some sort of a test. If you pass, you are arrested and <br>if you don't, they'll shoot and kill you. <br><br>According to Jenin residents, Israeli forces were not discriminatory <br>in their aggression, young men, old and disabled were targeted. 45-<br>year old Um Siri lamented how her son was not only forced to strip <br>naked, but how he was later used as a human shield, ;Then they took <br>my son, they had him strip naked, and they also started firing <br>between his legs to terrorize him. <br><br>Israeli soldiers arrested and detained Um Siri's son for days, during <br>this time, she did not know if he was dead or alive. Finally she <br>found him in a rescue shelter where he recounted how he was treated, <br>;When I also found my son, he told me that the soldiers took him to a <br>field near the camp with many other young men, he told me that the <br>soldiers had them walk in front of the tanks, as they were looking <br>for fighters. <br><br>The vulnerable and elderly, according to residents, were treated just <br>as mercilessly. Um Siri recounted how the women of Jenin tried to <br>come to the aid of some men, forced to stand naked publicly, in the <br>pouring rain. We passed by the sons of Sheikh Abdel Salam. They were <br>standing there in the rain, after the Israelis had them strip <br>completely naked. There was a woman who came with us. She took her <br>headscarf and tore it to several pieces and gave it to the young men <br>to cover themselves. A very thin old man approached while screaming, <br>My sons, my money, for God's sake, they took everything! The Israelis <br>had him strip naked like the day he was born. Once the women saw <br>that, they started pulling their hair, hitting their heads, and <br>wailing. He has all of his life's savings with him, because he was <br>worried that he might lose it in the invasion, but when the Israelis <br>stripped him naked, they found the money and took it. <br><br>Other residents described how young men were stripped naked and then <br>shot. Yusuf Shalabi, a young man from the camp explained how the <br>Israeli soldiers denied medical treatment to the wounded, I remember <br>this nightmare very well. It is very difficult to talk about it. I <br>remember them stripping the people naked, they would handcuff them <br>and blindfold them. I remember seeing two wounded men, one was <br>wounded in the shoulder and the other in the leg. They were screaming <br>in pain and the soldiers would not allow them to be treated. <br><br>The Israeli army, who according to Amnesty International committed <br>war crimes in Jenin in April of 2002, targeted medical workers as <br>well. They also forced the women to remove their head scarves. Seham <br>Shalabi, a young woman who works in a textile factory in Jenin <br>recounted her memories of those days last April. An army jeep came <br>and started circling the house, then it opened fire at us. Why would <br>they open fire at us? Then they came and they searched us, and had us <br>walk two by two, out of the camp. Just as we began moving, we saw <br>another group of tanks and bulldozers. We found some doctors and <br>medical workers, forced strip naked, handcuffed. Then they put them <br>in trucks and took them to the Salem detention center. The Israelis <br>started shouting and ordering us to take off our head scarves. <br><br>Humiliation of medial workers was not only reported by the residents <br>of Jenin, but these events were also narrated by the medical workers <br>themselves. Mohammed Rafi; the director of the Red Crescent Society <br>youth development programs in Jenin recounted how the Israelis held <br>medical workers hostage in the Jenin hospital for days, and then <br>forced them to strip naked as well. They did not allow anyone in or <br>out. If one of us wanted to leave to the hospital across the street, <br>it would take two hours of telephone calls and deliberation. <br>Ambulance drivers would be forced to wait for two hours with people <br>bleeding inside before they were allowed entry to the hospital, they <br>would take our volunteers or drivers, have them stripped naked, and <br>interrogated and insulted. <br><br>Of the scores upon scores of interviews conducted by Palestine <br>Chronicle reporters in the Jenin refugee camp, that act of forcing <br>civilians to strip naked was reported time and again. The Israeli <br>army has defended the action, saying that such tactics are necessary <br>to assure that Palestinians are not carrying explosives. <br><br>-(Many of the quotes within this article will be included the book <br>titled Searching Jenin, edited by Ramzy Baroud, Editor-in-Chief of <br>the Palestine Chronicle.
