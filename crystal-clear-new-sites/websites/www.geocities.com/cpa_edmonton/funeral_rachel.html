The IOF command had been told in advance that<br>the memorial event would be taking place in the IOF's unilaterally-declared,<br>illegal &quot;security zone&quot; where Rachel had been killed.<br><br>A group of international volunteers and media confronted the tank and told<br>the tank crew to leave so the memorial could be completed. The tank withdrew<br>a short distance then attempted to drive around the internationals and<br>charge at the Palestinians gathered at the memorial site.<br><br>A large group of internationals, Palestinians and media together forced the<br>tank to retreat and began laying and planting flowers next to the razor wire<br>fence on the other side of the &quot;security&quot; zone. &quot;We could see that this<br>wasteland created by the bulldozers was very recently a vegetable field,&quot;<br>reports Moiseiwitsch, &quot;because there were dug-up baby turnips strewn across<br>the ground.&quot;<br><br>The bulldozer charged again, aiming to crush the flowers that had just been<br>laid near the fence. Two ISM activists confronted the tank and it stopped<br>just two metres from them. When the tank stopped, several people began<br>putting flowers and pictures of Rachel onto the tank. The tank retreated to<br>try and avoid being covered in flowers.<br><br>The mourners again asked the tank to withdraw so they could complete the<br>memorial for their friend. The tank commander demanded that everyone leave<br>the area, and, when they refused, he threw tear gas and sound bombs at the<br>mourners.<br><br>The tank was joined by an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC), another tank, a<br>military road grader and an armoured bulldozer. The ISM activists who had<br>been with Rachel when she was murdered recognised the number on the<br>bulldozer. The IOF had sent bulldozer #949623 that killed Rachel Corrie to<br>drive through and disrupt her memorial.<br><br>&quot;The mourners were outraged by this desecration of Rachel's memory and tried<br>to block the advance of all five massive military vehicles,&quot; said Murray.<br>Two vehicles managed to drive around the protest but three were stopped by<br>the protesters. A large group of Palestinians and international volunteers<br>sat down and began planting flowers in front of them.<br><br>The first tank responded by gassing the seated protesters with a massive<br>stream of choking smoke that enveloped them and forced them to move. When<br>the tank fired several volleys of warning shots from a machine gun, the<br>mourners decided to leave the security zone.<br><br>&quot;All of us were all invited to Dr. Samir's still-standing house for tea,&quot;<br>said Moiseiwitsch.<br><br>The tank was left churning through the desolate security zone, covered in<br>flowers and pictures of Rachel Corrie.</span></td>

	<td><span style="font-size:14">STATEMENT ON THE MURDER OF RACHEL CORRIE<br><br><br><br><br>In Rafah, Gaza Strip today Rachel Corrie, a 23-year old American woman from Olympia, Washington, who was a volunteer with the International Solidarity Movement, was killed by the Israeli Army.&nbsp; Rachel was standing in the path of the bulldozer as it advanced towards her.&nbsp; When the bulldozer refused to stop or turn aside she climbed up onto the mound of dirt and rubble being gathered in front of it wearing a fluorescent jacket to look directly at the driver who kept on advancing.&nbsp; The bulldozer continued to advance so that she was pulled under the pile of dirt and rubble.&nbsp; After she had disappeared from view the driver kept advancing until the bulldozer was completely on top of her.&nbsp; The driver did not lift the bulldozer blade and so she was crushed beneath it.&nbsp; Then the driver backed up - effectively running over h! er again.&nbsp; The seven other ISM activists taking part in the action rushed to dig out her body.&nbsp; An ambulance rushed her to Al-Najar Hospital&nbsp; where she died.<br><br> <br><br>The Israeli Army consistently bulldozes Palestinian homes, particularly in Rafah, where over 100 homes have been demolished in the last two years.&nbsp; The International Solidarity Movement - both Palestinian and international citizens - calls upon the international community to break the silence around Israel's grotesque human rights abuses.&nbsp; International civilians are in the Occupied Palestinian Territories attempting to protect Palestinian human rights and lives precisely because formal international bodies have refused to take action to do so.&nbsp; Dozens of Palestinian civilians are being systematically murdered weekly, and today, a beautiful, conscientious American defender of human rights was killed trying to protect the home of a Palestinian family.&nbsp; <br><br> <br><br>This murder, along with Israel's continued destruction of Palestinian homes must be strongly condemned by the United States and the United Nations and they must insist that Israel abide by international law and UN Resolutions.&nbsp; The International Solidarity Movement also calls upon the United States government to conduct its own independent investigation into this incident and to take responsibility for the manner in which the Israeli government is using the $2.2 billion in military aid that we grant to Israel per year.&nbsp; This money and US-made weaponry is daily being used by the Israeli military to harm innocent civilians.&nbsp; The bulldozer that killed Rachel Corrie was an American-made Caterpillar D-9 bulldozer. <br><br> <br><br>The murder of Rachel Corrie was clearly NOT an accident.&nbsp; Eyewitnesses report that the bulldozer driver was able to see Rachel, and that they were shouting to the driver to stop.&nbsp; The Israeli government and army continue to blame the victims of violence carried out by the Israeli Army for their own suffering.&nbsp; Israel must be accountable for this criminal act and all criminal acts it is carrying out on a daily basis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.<br><br><br>The International Solidarity Movement greatly mourns the loss of Rachel Corrie and extends its heartfelt condolences to her family and friends.&nbsp; We pledge to continue actively working for the ideals of freedom and justice that Rachel died for.<br><br><br><br><br>For photos of the incident, please visit</span><a href="http://www.palsolidarity.org"><span style="font-size:14"> www.palsolidarity.org.</span></a></td>
