<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the traditions of Islam, Nebi Musa is the
burial site for Moses; it is a holy place. The Torah says that Moses died
without entering the Land of Canaan and that no one knows the place of
his burial, but according to the Muslims his body was carried across the
river to be buried here in the &quot;Promised Land.&quot; Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam have all at one time or another considered themselves to be the
legitimate heir to a promise given by God to Moses. In The Bible, the promise
of the land was never merely a deed of property given to a favorite tribe
but a conditional contract with the promise of expulsion from the land
in the event of misbehavior. Over the last three thousand years, there
have been repeated occasions when new religious factions, seeing decadence
around them, read again old texts and decided that the promise could apply
to them if they upheld the laws. By this time we have many groups who believe
themselves to be at home here, in the promised land. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jericho is one of the oldest towns of which we have archeological
evidence. Sheep have been herded on these slopes for at least five thousand
years. This is the area near Jericho known as &quot;the wilderness,&quot;
where Jesus is said to have wandered for forty days and nights. One would
assume he did this during the winter when brief rains turn all but south
facing slopes of the hills green, and the weather is mild. In that season,
such a wander is a delight -- not a great ordeal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The photographer writes: &quot;One morning near Nebi Musa
I was shooting near a deep escarpment when a large camel began pestering
me. She became so persistent that I went over the edge and clung to the
steep slope for a few minutes until she went away. Camels have a hard time
with very steep places. This was unusual, for despite their reputations,
I have rarely found camels to be aggressive toward me. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some time later I was in the same general area when I
heard a sheep bleating somewhere far below. Sheep are like Japanese tourists;
they almost never occur alone but travel in flocks. Then I spotted it and
had a look with my longest lens. On closer inspection it was not a sheep
but a baby camel. Then I began to understand the behavior of the adult
camel earlier in the morning. I climbed down the cliff and found that this
was a new born with its umbilical cord still bloody. It was a bit banged
up, but it was very much alive, and nothing seemed broken. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I set off across the hills looking for its likely owner,
but I tired after a time and lay down in the middle of nowhere and took
a nap. When I awoke there were sheep all about and one puzzled shepherd
standing over me. As soon as I jumped up and explained as best I could
about the baby camel, the shepherd began calling with amazing volume for
someone else whom he said was the concerned owner. After fifteen or twenty
minutes the owner of the camel appeared, thrilled to find out what had
become of the baby camel. He had noticed that the mother was no longer
huge, but he had searched in vain for a body, and she had no baby with
her. </FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>When my new friend and I reached the precipace
from which the baby camel could be seen, it became obvious that my eyes
were better than those of this shepherd, and he had to take my word that
the camel was in fact way down there. He practically ran down the slope,
and soon we had the creature on its feet. I insisted on a picture, though
I only had time for one quick one. &quot;</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The photographer continues: &quot;The camel's owner was
not much larger than I was. I probably weighed about one hundred and twenty
pounds at the time. For the two of us a baby camel was a handfull, and
when he said that we were going to carry the thing back up to the top of
the cliff, I said that he was joking. In the end we did it, and he gave
me not a moments rest all the way to the top. I have never before or since
felt my heart pound like that, fast and hard, thud, thud, thud, thud....
Then a strange thing happened. I got over it very quickly. At a high altitude
one gets out of breath rather easily, but here we were well below sea level,
and in that thick air I was back to normal in a short time. &quot;</FONT></P>
