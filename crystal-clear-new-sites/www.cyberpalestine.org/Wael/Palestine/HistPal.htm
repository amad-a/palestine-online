<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>Great Britin gained Palestine from the Ottoman Empire
after World War I and ruled it by a League of Nations mandate. In 1917,
There were over 500,000 Arabs and about 50,000 Jews in Palestine. More
than half of the Jews living in Palestine at that time were recent immigrants,
who had come to Palestine in the preceding decades in order to escape persecution
in Europe. Thus, less than 5% of the population of Palestine were native
Jewish Palestinians. Arab Palestinians owned 97.5% of the land, while Jews
(both natives and immigrants) owned only 2.5% of the land. </FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During and after World War II, waves of Jewish refugees
from Europe overwhelmed the region, hoping to create a Jewish homeland
(an ideology known as Zionism). During the thirty years of British rule,
however, the Zionists were able to purchase only about 3.5% of the land
of Palestine, in spite of the encouragement of the British Government and
much of this land was transferred to Zionist bodies by the British Government
directly rather than being sold by Arab owners. </FONT></P>

<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1947, The United Nations (representing only a fraction
of the world's peoples) voted to divide Palestine into separate Jewish
and Arab states, a plan the Arabs did not accept. Why? Even though Jews
owned only less than 6% of the total land area of Palestine and composed
about 1/3 of its population (mostly immigrants) ,the General Assembly of
the UN granted that proposed Jewish state about 54% of the total area of
the country! The following year Israel declared independence and five Arab
nations attacked. By May 1948, Israel had immediately occupied 80.48% of
the total land area of Palestine but most of this land was taken: 1.before
the formal end of the British forces from Palestine, 2. before the entry
of Arab armies to protect Arab Palestinians, and 3. before the the Arab-Israeli
war. In the war, over 700,000 Arab Palestinians were displaced from their
homes.</FONT></TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>Forty-four years after Israeli independence a Palestinian
homeland still did not exist. During the Six Day War of 1967 Israel captured
the West Bank, formerly held by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip, held by Egypt
bringing all of historic Palestine under occupation. </FONT></TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli-PLO agreement signed in Washington in September
1993 provided for a transitional period not exceeding five years of limited
Palestinian self-rule in parts of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area of
the West Bank. Today that self-rule has been extended to include Ramallah,
Nablus, Jenin, Tulkaram, Qalqilya, part of Al Khalil (Hebron).. Whether
this is the beginning of an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds
(Jerusalem) as its capital or just an Israeli version of South Africa's
racist &quot;homelands&quot; policies remains to be seen.</FONT></TD>
