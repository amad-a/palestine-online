<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>A ravine begins on the East side of the Mount
of Olives and grows into an impressive canyon with a Christian monastery
built into a cliff near its lower end. One can walk from Jerusalem to this
point near Jericho down an ancient footpath in a few hours. Here, a thousand
feet below sea level, the wadi joins the flood plain of the Jordan River.
On the mountain to the left, Herod the Great had a summer palace. Israeli
archaeologists work on nearby on Roman baths while Bedoin tent are not
too far away. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This image was taken in the valley of a wadi that is a
tributary to the east of the Jordan River north of Jericho. In the winter
and early spring the land is green, but by May all will be golden, brown,
and dry. If you look close, you can see a flock of sheep and a family caring
for them. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ancient Israel was a tribe that arrived from the desert
and settled in the hills, while the Philistines came from the sea and and
controlled cities on the coastal plain. In the twentieth century it is
the Palestinians who have roots and cousins in the desert and who occupy
the hills, while the Israelis came from across the sea and settled in cities
on the coastal plain.</FONT></P>
