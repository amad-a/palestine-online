<P><font size="3">The village of Shuqba is located northwest of Jerusalem
inside what is commonly called the West Bank. The
West Bank, along with Israel and the Gaza Strip, comprise the land known
for over 2,000 years as <a HREF="http://www.cyberpalestine.org/Wael/Palestine/Palestine.htm">Palestine</a>.
According to what is commonly referred to as the &quot;two-state solution&quot;
to the Palestinian-Zionist conflict, Palestinians are entitled to a state
comprised of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem (less than 30% of their
original homeland) while Israel keeps the rest of historic Palestine. This
will be determined by the <a HREF="http://www.cyberpalestine.org/Wael/Peace/Peace.htm">Oslo
Peace Accords</a> signed in 1993 but, to date, Israel has not even agreed
to even hand over a majority of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.</font></P>

<P><font size="3">You will probably not find Shuqba on most maps but it
is located about 15 kilometers northwest of Ramallah, about 30 kilometers
northwest of Jerusalem and a just a few kilometers from the &quot;Green Line&quot;
that separates Israel from the West Bank. Al-Lyd (Lod) and Al-Ramla (Ramle)
are directly across the Green Line and are only a few minutes drive away once
you've crossed the Green Line. For a detailed map, click <a HREF="http://www.cyberpalestine.org/Wael/shuqba/shuqba.jpg">here</a>.
Shuqba stretches over several hills and the valleys between them. Besides
the other surrounding Palestinian villages, several Israel settlements
(illegal under international law) and bypass roads surround Shuqba. They
were built on lands confiscated or bought (through dubious means) from
Shuqba and the other Palestinian villages. To read more about a neighboring
village's experiences, click
<A HREF="http://www.arij.org/paleye/qiddis/">here</A>. In September 1997,
over 300 olive trees belonging to Shuqba were uprooted to make way for
a proposed settler bypass road. In 1999, more land was confiscated near the main entrance
to the village.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font size="3"> After Ariha (Jericho), Shuqba is believed to be one of, if
not the oldest,
village in Palestine.&nbsp;The many ruins around Shuqba (see below) are proof
of these very ancient beginnings. Specifically, there is a&nbsp; nearby cave
that was used by our ancient ancestors. Before the <i> Intifada</i> (uprising)
tourists from all over the world often used come to see it for its archeological and historical
value.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P align="center"><font size="3"><img border="0" src="shuqbacave.jpg" width="283" height="183"></font></P>

<P align="center"><font size="2">the famous Shuqba Cave</font></P>

<P align="left"><font size="3">The cave lies on the northern bank of Wadi Al
Natuf, in the Ramallah area. It was formed by karastic activity. Here were first
discovered the remains of the Natufian culture that was named after the Wadi. This
culture dates to the middle of the Paleolithic period (10000-8000 BC). Natufian culture is defined by an assemblage which includes microlithic
components of complex tools. Natufians may have moved within a territory to exploit their resources most effectively but they certainly maintained
base villages. The cemeteries of el-Wad, Shuqba, Eynam and Nahal Oren contained 87, 45, 82 and 50 burials respectively.
Considering the small size of these sites, archeologists agree that the occupation must have been for a considerable time.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font size="3">As for the name &quot;Shuqba&quot;, one theory says it named for its founder, Shaqeeb, but the name got corrupted over the centuries. Another theory
says the name was originally 'Shaqfa&quot;, which was later corrupted to
&quot;Shaqba&quot;, which finally became Shuqba.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font size="3">Shuqba, like the rest of Palestine, was once part of the
Roman Empire, then the Islamic Empire, the Ottoman Empire and earlier this
century, a British Mandate that ended in 1948.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font size="3">Until 1948, Shuqba was part of Al-Ramla district. This
district stretched from the coast, south of Yaffa (Jaffa), to the hills
of central Palestine, around the Latrun area.</font></P>

FOR&nbsp;MODERN&nbsp;PALESTINIAN&nbsp;HISTORY</font></a></P></CENTER>

<P><font size="3">During the 1948 war, Zionists occupied most of the district
except for a handful of villages in the far east and the Latrun salient.
Most of the occupied Palestinian villages of Al-Ramla district were subsequently
depopulated and destroyed by Zionist forces. The three villages of the
Latrun were later destroyed in 1967 and their lands were annexed. In fact, a few
families from the destroyed village of Beit Nabala settled in Shuqba. The
Green Line that was drawn to separate the areas occupied by Israel from
the remaining areas was drawn just west of Shuqba's village lands. Shuqba
and the few other remaining villages were later incorporated into the Ramallah
district of what became the Jordanian-controlled West Bank.</font></P>

<CENTER><P><font size="3"><IMG SRC="detail.jpg" BORDER=5 width="309" height="175"></font></P></CENTER>

<P><font size="2">On October 14, 1953, a neighboring village, Qibya, was
attacked by an Israeli military force led by Ariel Sharon (who is now an Israeli
politician). Upon arrival, it was&nbsp; surrounded and cordoned off from all of the
neighboring Palestinian villages. The attack began with concentrated, indiscriminate artillery fire on the homes in the village. This continued until the
main force reached the outskirts of the village. Meanwhile, other forces headed for nearby Arab towns
like&nbsp; Shuqba, Budrus and Na'lin in order to distract them and prevent any aid from reaching the people in Qibya. They also planted mines on various roads so as to isolate
the village completely. As units of the Israeli infantry were attacking the village residents, units of military engineers were placing
explosives around some of the houses in the village and blowing them up with everyone in them under the protection of the infantrymen,
who fired on everyone who tried to flee.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font size="2"> These acts of brutality continued until 4:00 a.m., October 15, 1953, at which time the
Israeli forces withdrew to the bases from which they had begun.16 There was a particular sight the memory of which remained in the minds of all
who saw it: an Arab woman sitting on a pile of debris and casting a forlorn look into the sky. From beneath the rubble one could see
small legs and hands which were the remains of her six children, while the bullet-maimed body of her husband lay in the road before
her. This vicious terrorist attack resulted in the destruction of 56 houses, the village mosque, the village school and the water tank which
supplied it with water. Moreover, 67 citizens lost their lives, both men and women, with many others
wounded.&nbsp; Ariel Sharon ,stated that his leaders' orders had been clear with regard to how the residents of the village were to be dealt with. He says, "The orders were utterly clear: Qibya was to be an
example to everyone.</font></P>

<P><font size="3">In 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip,
thereby controlling all of historic Palestine. In 1980, Shuqba lost most
of its lands bordering the Green Line to Israeli confiscation. My family
lost a large tract of land in this area, called the Dusra Valley (named
for the nearby Roman-era ruins). It was used for planting wheat and other crops for sale
but today any villager who enters can be shot on the spot by nearby Israeli
soldiers.&nbsp;</font></P>

<CENTER><P><font size="3"><IMG SRC="dusra.jpg" BORDER=5 HEIGHT=313 WIDTH=459></font></P><P><font size="2">The Dusra Valley. The road (used by the Israeli military) in
the picture represents Israel's version of the Green Line. In the center
is a well dug by my family just before the land was confiscated.</font> </P></CENTER>

<P><font size="3">About 1/3 of Shuqba's inhabitants fled during the 1967
war and most settled in the Al-Zarqa refugee camp in Jordan. Others went to
Kuwait and other Arab countries or to&nbsp; the United States. Today, limited
autonomy has been granted to parts of the West Bank but Shuqba is still,
for all practical purposes, under Israeli control.</font></P>

<P><font size="3">Shuqba is typical of most Palestinian villages. The village
has a boys' school and a girls' school. A new girls' school was built only
two years ago. Students can study until grade 9 there. After that, they
must go to secondary schools in the nearby villages of Aboud or Na'lin.</font></P>

<CENTER><P><font size="3"><IMG SRC="west1.jpg" BORDER=3 HEIGHT=277 WIDTH=348> <IMG SRC="west2.jpg" BORDER=5 HEIGHT=274 WIDTH=415></font></P><P><font size="2">Two views from the east at sunset.The boys' school is at the
top center of the second picture. The minaret of the village mosque is near
the top of the first picture.</font></P></CENTER>

<P><font size="3">All of the inhabitants are Muslim and there is big beautiful
mosque in the center of the village that was built not too long ago. The
old mosque is now used as a kindergarten.</font></P>

<CENTER><P><font size="3"><IMG SRC="mosque.jpg" BORDER=5 HEIGHT=271 WIDTH=389></font></P><P><font size="3">The new village mosque, rear view</font> </P></CENTER>

<P><font size="3">Most of the villagers are farmers or laborers. Those who
farm raise livestock, cereal grains, or vegetables and most families harvest
olives, figs, cactus pears, etc. in the late summer and fall. As the cost
of feeding livestock soars and more land is confiscated, economic self-sufficiency
is on the decline and most villages are forced to turn to work in Israel or, ironically, the settlements.</font></P>

<CENTER><P><font size="3"><IMG SRC="olive.jpg" BORDER=5 HEIGHT=314 WIDTH=463></font></P><P><font size="2">Me standing next to an ancient olive tree. This is known as
a &quot;Rumi&quot; olive tree, referring to the fact that it has been here
since Roman times.</font> </P><P><a HREF="http://www.cyberpalestine.org/Wael/shuqba/orchard.jpg"><font size="3"><IMG SRC="sorchard.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=256 WIDTH=371></font></a></P><P><font size="2">My family's olive orchard just oustide the village. Like most
village lands, it is in danger of being confiscated by the Israelis. Because
there are no roads nearby, it is only accessible by animal. My cousin is
riding one of the few remaining camels in our region.<I> (click on picture

<P><font size="3">There are no factories or plants except for a small brick
factory. The village received full-time electricity in the 1980's but there
are no telephone lines. A few people have mobile phones. There are two
main indigenous clans in the village: my father's clan, Dar (&quot;House
of&quot;) Abu Kadah,
and my mother's clan, Dar Shalash. There are also three other smaller clans,
the Masris (who originated in Egypt), the Hassans (who originated from a village
near Jerusalem), and the Thabets (who originate from a nearby village). There is a friendly rivalry between them but
they generally get along. There are almost 3,000 inhabitants living there
right now. However, there thousands more Shuqbans across the world. Most
live in other Arab countries (Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, etc.)
or the eastern United States. See:&nbsp; </font><b><tt><a href="../people.htm"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">People from Shuqba on the Internet</font></a></tt></b>
