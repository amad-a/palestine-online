    Gaza, like the rest of the Palestinian cities, suffered, during the Israeli occupation
    which continued for about 27 years, from international isolation. Thus, Gaza municipality
    now needs to open itself for the outside world and be part of this world. Since 1994, the
    relations of Gaza City with other international cities have positively developed through
    dialogue and mutual understanding. The geographical proximity and historical relations
    between the Middle East and Europe, as well as the natural interest in a number of issues,
    have a great impact on developing the relations between Gaza and some European cities.
    Some include Dunkerque in France, Barcelona in Spain and Torino in Italy. The common
    language and culture of Gaza and the Arab cities have a great impact on developing the
    relations with Arab cities including Dubai, the gem of the Arab Gulf. Cities like Villa
    El-Salvador in Peru, South America developed relations with Gaza City on a human basis.
    The relations of Gaza City with international cities ranged from mere cooperation,
    solidarity and friendship in different fields, to township. As a result of these
    relations, experiences were exchanged in the fields of civil service, conserving the
    environment and developing the basic infrastructure of Gaza City. Moreover, the residents
    of these cities understood the reality of the Palestinian problem and felt sympathy with
    the Palestinian people. </font><font size="-1"></p>

    provided training to the library staff in France and donated some of the costs to renovate
    the library building. It also donated funds to furnish the library and provided computers
    and books. At present, the final touches are added to the design of the Qubbeh Park where
    Dunkerque will donate some of the establishment costs. </p>
