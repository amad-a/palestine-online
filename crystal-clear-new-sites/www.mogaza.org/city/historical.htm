    </font><font SIZE="2">Gaza is one of the oldest cities in the world. The city is
    strategically situated between two continents, Asia and Africa. This geographical location
    made the city acquire a strategic and extraordinary military status; it is the southern
    front defense line not only of Palestine but of all Sham area(Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan)
    as well. It is also</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">,&nbsp; </font><font SIZE="2">the east northern advanced defense line of</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">&nbsp; </font><font SIZE="2">the Egyption depth. Consequently, the city had been
    a battle field for most of the ancient and recent empires</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">, </font><font SIZE="2">the Pharaonic, the Assyrian,
    the Persian, the Greek, the Roman, the Crusades, and during the First World War</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Situated at the climate division line and the latitude 31.3 degree
    north to the Equator. Gaza has occupied a dividing position between the desert in the
    south and the Mediterranean climate in the north. This location, as such, had made the
    city acquire the</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2"> </font><font SIZE="2">role
    of a prosperous trading market for world products, both tropical, and cold. This
    importance was reinforced by its distinguished position on a hill, 45m above sea level and
    within a range of 3 Km. away from the sea. The Area of ancient Gaza was about</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2"> 1 </font><font SIZE="2">Km. square, it was situated
    over hill and surrounded by a large wall with four gates in the four directions</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sea Gate (Memas) in the west, Asklan Gate in the north, Hebron Gate
    in the east and El-Daroom in the south</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The names given to the these gates were changing in accordance with the
    changing consecutive empires. Those gates used to be closed at sunset, therefore the city
    inaccessible fortitude against the enemy</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to all these powerful factors, our ancestors, the Arab Cana'nites
    established the city and called it Gaza around the year 3000 BC. The Arab Minions who
    resided in Gaza, gave it the same name. They helped in reviving the city and had strong
    ties with Gaza citizens as Ma'an merchants were married to Gazans. The Pharaohs, during
    the reign of the Pharaoh III, 1447-1501 BC., gave it the name Gazatwa which is related to
    the treasures said to be buried by Cambayses during the Persian rule</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The name Gaza remained immortal without any change and the Arab
    associated it with Hashem, the name of Prophet Mohammad's granfather, (peace be upon him)
    to become Gazat Hashem. Hashem Ben Abed Manaf died in the city during one of his trading
    journeys round the end of 6th century</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not strange however, that the city was described as the Kings
    Tunnel and the Gate between Africa and Asia by Napoleon Bonaparte</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">.</font></td>
