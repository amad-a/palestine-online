    situated in the east of Gaza 85 meters above the sea level. This has made El-Montar Hill
    acquire a strategic military stronghold in the past. As a key access to Gaza, the hill was
    a camping place for Napoleon's army. During World War I<font FACE="Traditional Arabic">, </font>thousands
    of allies soldiers were killed in front of El-Montar Hill. All of them were buried in
    Gaza's First World War Cemetery<font FACE="Traditional Arabic">.</p>
    </font><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moslems, during their conquests, made use of El-Montar&#146;s
    strategic location. They used it as a surveillance point, thus following the example of
    their ancestors the revered Caliphs by choosing hills and high positions as surveillance
    towers. In case of an<font FACE="Traditional Arabic"> </font>assault against the city, the
    men at these points would ignite fire at night or release smoke in the day time. Then the
    city inhabitants would quickly learn about the coming enemy. Consequently, the name
    El-Montar was exclusive to the functional implication of the Hill. This contradicts with
    the assumption of some Orientalists who claimed that El-Montar was derived from Montarious
    or Porphyries the priest who introduced Christianity to Gaza at the outset of the fifth
    century AD. Another claim is that, during the funeral of one the righteous men, the corpse
    flew then descended. All these claims are unfounded and the best evidence is the
    application of the name to various hills and high positions in Palestine and Jordan. The
    tomb of one of the righteous men (Sheikh Mohammed El-Batahi) on the hill reinforced the
    importance of the hill where annual festivals used to be held on the hill. The above
    mentioned Sheikh is strongly related to Sheikh Radwan and Sheikh Ejleen, the former refers
    to a Northern suburb of Gaza, while the latter refers to a Southern one. The three Sheikhs
    are said to be the sons of Shekh Arkoub Zein Hamada, the son of Sheikh Ali Iben Aleem,
    buried in Arsouf near Jaffa. The latter is directly related to Omar Iben El-Kattab (God
    bless him) one of<font FACE="Traditional Arabic"> </font>the four Caliphs<font FACE="Traditional Arabic">. </font></p>

    for more research and investigation<font FACE="Traditional Arabic">.</font></font></td>
