    <td width="100%"><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">El-Remal is one of the recent suburbs
    in Gaza. It came to life in the aftermath of the Second World War. The whole area, lying
    on the Mediterranean was covered with sand. For this reason, it was called El-Remal, an
    Arabic word meaning sand. In the 1920&#146;s, a road was constructed, thus linking this
    remote area with the old city. </p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the British Mandate, specifically in the 1903&#146;s Gaza
    central prison was built since then and owing to increasing population, building and
    construction works have extended to El-Remal. Moreover the Egyptian Administration started
    to allocate land among employees for residential purposes. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 1960&#146;s El-Remal neighborhood highly flourished and turned
    out to be an urban area where the Legislative Council Building, along with, schools,
    cinemas were constructed. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the wake of the 1948 Catastrophe, precisely in 1950, the Beach camp
    was constructed in order to shelter the displaced Palestinians. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of population living at El-Remal reached 70.000 as estimated
    in March 1996 by the Central Census Administration. Nowadays El-Remal is divided into two
    parts, the southern and the northern. The latter lies to the North of Omar El-Mokhtar,
    while the former lies to the North. </p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">The reason behind the dramatic increase of
    El-Remal&#146;s population, is that, El-Naser city was built in the northern part in the
    1960&#146;s. it was mainly built for the sons of the martyrs. The city which stretched to
    the north had a hospital, a school and a mosque. In the 1970&#146;s, a suburb, called
    El-Sheikh Radwan and related to the above mentioned Sheikh was constructed.</font></td>
