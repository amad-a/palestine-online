    Neighborhood also lies in the center of the ancient overhill city. It occupies its
    southern part and has been so called due to the fact that part of the town was densely
    planted by olive trees, some of them still cover the southern part of this neighborhood.
    El-Zaytoon was an integral part of the city center representing together with El-Daraj the
    commercial center before World War I. During the first war, the two parts were separated
    by Jamal Basha Street, later to be called Omar El-Mokhtar Street in the thirties. As
    described by Jabaly 1644, the area used to be a complex of brisky markets such as
    Surojeia, El-Najareen Markets etc.</p>
    <p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<font size="-1"><img src="church.jpg" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="260"></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">El-Zaytoon Neighborhood was distinguished for its holy and antique
    places. These include El-Shama&#146;a, El-Ajamy and Kateb Wellaia mosque. The latter still
    boasts the survival of its ancient minaret. The inscription which goes back to the year
    735 Hijri appears on a marble stone at the bottom of this minaret can be translated as
    follows: </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE MOST COMPASSIONATE, EVER MERCIFUL. AT THE
    REQUEST OF OUR MASTER, ELASHRAFI LESEIFY AFNAN ELANY, DEPUTY SULTAN IN SAFE GUARDED GAZA,
    THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MINARET WAS ORDERED WITH THE HOPE OF OBTAINING GOD&#146;S
    SATISFACION AT THE BEGINNING OF MOHARAM IN THE YEAR 735&quot;. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This inscription surrounds a circle composed of a pen case with a cup
    in the middle and a lily beneath. The mosque was renovated by Ahmed Beik, a province clerk
    during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Murad 925 Hijri. This is clearly shown on the
    marble door still.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a cemetery just at the southern outskirts of El-Zaitoun. This
    cemetery with marble columns in the middle used to be called Martyrs cemetery. The names
    of some of the martyrs who died in defense of the city against invaders. Were written on
    those columns. For this reason, this part is still called the Columns Suburb &quot;Haret
    El-Awameed&quot;. One of the Most important Christian buildings is Porphyrius Church built
    in 5th century, Bishop Prophyrius was buried in that church.</font></td>
