    <td width="100%"><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaza City played an important role as a
    port and a trade base but it lost its importance by the end of the Ottoman period. It is
    important to mention here, that, in 1905, Gaza exported amounts of wheat, barley, corn,
    dates, sesame, leather and chicken worth US$ 1.5 millions through its port. Different
    kinds of goods were also imported through the port. In the same year (1905), the value of
    the imports reached US$ 750,000 and thus Gaza achieved a balance of trade in its favor. It
    seems that the ports of Jaffa and Haifa negatively affected Gaza port and this resulted in
    gradual economic recession. After the Israeli occupation, Gaza port completely lost its
    role - it has not been functioning until present. The residents of Gaza were interested in
    trade markets, so they established markets and stores to display their goods. The most
    important of these is the Al-Qaisaria Market, which still exists as a witness of history.
    The market is located in the Daraj Quarter. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, Gaza's trade depends only on Egypt and Israel. It imports
    and exports some agricultural and industrial products. On several occasions, citrus fruits
    and flowers were exported to different countries despite the obstacles, which Israel
    creates to destroy the exporting process. An international airport was also established in
    Gaza; it is expected that trade would flourish after the opening of the airport and after
    constructing the new seaport. There are Palestinian and international attempts to
    construct the port, but the Israeli delay and rejection face them in order to restrict the
    exporting and importing to the Israeli ports. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Economy in Gaza depends mainly on the fishing industry, a large part of
    this industry is exported. Some Gaza residents graze sheep and goats to use their milk,
    meat, wool and leather; such materials are also used in some of the local industries. Gaza
    municipality established a modern, developed slaughterhouse, which follows the most recent
    health and work laws and regulations. It is automatically run by the most developed
    methods and systems in the world and is considered one of the most developed
    slaughterhouses in the Middle East. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaza municipality encourages trade by providing the residents with
    modern and organized markets including the Yarmouk Popular Market, which is under
    construction and considered the first central market in the city.</font></td>
