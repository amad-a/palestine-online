    <p ALIGN="center"></font><font FACE="Arial" color="#FF0000" size="5">A Badge of Shame!</font></b><font FACE="Arial" size="3"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Municipality of Gaza
    is extremely appalled by the barbarian and brutal Israeli practices against the innocent
    Palestinian civilians.</font><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Since the outbreak
    of the bloodiest massacre of Al Aqsa Mosque, which was invoked by the provocative visit of
    the notorious terrorist Sharon to Al Aqsa Holy shrine. The Municipality of Gaza
    represented by Mayor Aown shawa, the Municipal Council and senior staff members, has been
    closely and continuously following up the accelerating incidents of confrontations between
    the innocent and unarmed palestinian civilians and Israeli army equipped with the most
    sophisticated weapons of mass killing. The Municipality issued a series of statements
    denouncing the Israeli forces of occupation for killing and injuring thousands of
    Palestinians by using internationally banned weapons. The municipal council, headed by the
    Mayor, appealed to the world community to stand beside the Palestinian people in order to
    put an end to the most brutal and fascist campaign of killing and annihilation of the
    Palestinian people.</font><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Mayor Shawa
    calls for pressure on Israel</font></b><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gaza Municipality
    represented by the Mayor and the members of the municipal council participated in marches
    of protest against the ugly crime committed by the Israelis against our people. The Mayor
    called for the European Union, the United Nations and the Security Council to exercise
    pressure on Israel in order to stop the crime perpetrated against the Palestinian people.
    Being the president of APLA, association of Palestinian Local Authorities, Mr. Shawa made
    contacts with several town organizations and some mayors in Europe. He explained to them
    the situation on the ground and informed them about the massacres committed by the
    Israelis with cold blood. In return, Gaza Municipality received massages of solidarity
    from many European cities and organizations. </font><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Mayor visits
    the injured and pays tribute to martyrs</font></b><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Mayor and the
    members of the municipal councils have visited the wounded people at Shifa hospital.
    Regardless of their injuries that vindicated the brutality of the Israeli soldiers, the
    wounded showed high morale and pledged to continue their struggle until the Palestinian
    State with Jerusalem as its capital is established. The Mayor and the members of the
    municipal council were very shocked by the severe injuries of some young men; injuries
    that were caused by internationally banned weapons and at the same time showed the
    randomness of shooting. The Municipality of Gaza has payed tribute to the martyrs of the
    current Intifada against the Israeli occupation. </font><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">Israel is not interested in genuine peace but
    rather in bloodshed</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In the sequence of
    his comments on the recent massacres committed against the Palestinians, Mayor Shawa said
    that Israel does not desire peace but rather seeks to impose certain solutions that do not
    accord with international legitimacy and ignore the feelings of the Muslim world. Sharon
    would not have desecrated Al Aqsa without the knowledge and the consent of Barak who
    supported the visit by sending three thousand soldiers to protect him. The Mayor affirmed
    that Israel would never comply with the International legitimacy without the pressure of
    the international community, he was skeptical of the American role because he believes
    that USA completely adopts the Israeli stand, therefore, it would not be a fair judge. </font><font FACE="Arial" size="2"></p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To cope with the
    newly emergent situations, the Municipality of Gaza declared a state of emergency . &nbsp;
    All the departments and the employees have been on alert in order to serve the public
    around the clock and to handle every rising problem on the spot. On the other hand, the
    employees of the municipality hurried to help their brothers by donating their blood and
    giving first aid to the wounded. </font></td>
