    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaza City has hosted a one-day conference for urban development. The
    conference which was held at Rashad Al Shawa Center on Sept. 2<sup>nd</sup> was organized
    by APLA, the Association of Local Palestinian Authorities in conjunction with the Italian
    Committee at UTO, the United Town Organization. The European participants have represented
    35 municipalities, provinces and governorates from France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and
    Portugal. The Palestinian side was represented by 22 municipalities. The conference has
    achieved numerous aims. The most important of which is laying a mechanism where by
    cooperation between the European and the Palestinian municipalities, mainly in the field
    of urban development and planning, is fostered. Reinforcing the financial potentialities
    of the Palestinian municipalities was another major concern of the conference. On
    political level, the conference has stressed the Palestinian rights of self-determination
    and the establishment of the imminent Palestinian Sate with East Jerusalem as its capital.
