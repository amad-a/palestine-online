    Artificial Limbs &amp; Polio Center is a non governmental organization that specializes in
    manufacturing and fitting prosthesis and various apparatus to assist persons with
    paralysis and amputated limbs. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Artificial Limbs &amp; Polio Center manufactures prosthesis and
    other appliances for disabled person&#146;s vitrans, Intifada victims and others who are
    in need.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Center is the only one of its type in the Gaza Strip and it is one
    of Gaza Municipality Centers.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of establishing the center emerged in 1974, when Gazans, who
    needed such services, had to travel to Israel for treatement.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The late President of Benevolent Society for the Gaza Strip. Mr. Rashad
    Shawwa , in co-ordination with representatives of other local charitable organizations
    established the first prosthetic workshop. Two employees were sent to Amman, Jordan, for a
    Two-years training program in prosthesis manufacture. Work started in 1978 in a room at
    the Ahli Arab Hospital. When demand increased, services expanded and the Artificial Limbs
    &amp; Polio Center was built in its present place in 1985 in Gaza City. Victimes of the
    Intifada, children and others are treated upon medical recommendations. Every Thursday an
    orthopedic surgeon and a consultant physiotherapist attend at the ctinic of the center to
    examine new cases and decide what services are needed. </font></td>

    get the appliance manufactured at the center. The center so far served 3750 persons with

      <li></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">Many of the physically handicapped
        people in the center were not fortunate enough to be rehabilitated because of lack of
        financial support. Our aim is to find financial support to adopt a number of these cases,
        especially those who are in a desperate need of rehabilitation. On the other hand the
        center will furnish any concerned party with names, numbers and costs.</font><font
        FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></li>
      <li><font color="#800000">The center is in a great need of a training program for the six
        employees, to be able to improve their technical methods in dealing with different cases.
        This program is preferred to be in Germany or in Qatar. It is important to mention that
        the center uses materials imported from Germany. The cost of this program is $4000
        /person. Another suggested idea is to bring in an expert to the center in Gaza to train
        the staff.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#800000">The center needs to replace some of the old equipment in the
        center. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#800000">There is a great need for an advanced computer system that will
        accommodate the increasing number of disability cases, that will enable the center to
        identify the cause of the case, the age, the possibility of rehabilitation, the Geographic
        distribution, sex differentiation, in addition to many other things which will assist in
        assessing each individual case. </font></font></li>
