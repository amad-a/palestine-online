The <Font size=+1><b>Jerusalem Hotel</font></b> is situated in the heart 
of Jerusalem. It is a short
walking distance to the Old City and few minutes away from both Salah Eddin
and Ben Yehuda streets, which are the main shopping areas of East and West 
Jerusalem, respectively. To get to the hotel from the central bus station in 
Jerusalem, take the 27 bus, which ends right in front of the hotel. The 
easiest and probably the most reasonable way to get to the hotel from the 
airport is via the Nesher collective taxi service. <p>
