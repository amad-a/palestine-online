    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Palestine Online was first "exhibited" in November 2023, at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, at a table for <a
            href="https://sfpc.study/">School For Poetic Computation's</a> <a
            href="https://pioneerworks.org/programs/software-for-artists-day-8">Software For Artists Day</a>. The
        original installation consisted of a linux laptop connected to a CRT monitor and a mouse, running the websites
        in a full screen firefox window. Through screen mirroring, I showcased a number of scraped websites stitched
        together with a rudimentary landing page, providing guidance across the table. The first version of
        palestineonline.net, which was to become the home of the project, was built over the following weekend and
        launched shortly after, with the simple aim of letting the original installation's archived sites be accessible
        anywhere. <br><br>

    <p>
        I came back to Palestine Online in January of 2024, after being invited by <a href="https://toddwords.com/">Todd
            Anderson</a> to give a talk on the project for Wordhack at Wonderville. I used the talk as an opportunity to
        research and compile more original sites for the archive, as well as to build out a more fleshed out version of
        palestineonline.net, with some added features such as loading a random site, site info notes, and linking pages
        to
        their original Wayback Machine links (Though in the process of this major structural update, I abandoned the
        primitive mobile responsiveness of the original site).

    <p>This updated web version was developed alongside a custom version of Palestine Online created for an exhibition
        by
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sa__la__sil_/">studio salasil</a> entitled <i>Crystal Clear</i>, shown at <a
            href="https://www.baytalmamzar.org/">Bayt Al Mamzar</a> in Dubai, which revisited the project as a full
        screen
        installation (though this time a standaolone, unsupervised one). I continued finding and collecting new websites
        for
        workshops and lectures (and Sara bin Safwan and Zainab Hassoon of studio salasil helped find and curate some
        incredible sites for the archive as well), though did not make any ugprades to the UI.

    <h2>Fellowship plan</h2>

    <p>
        I applied to the Processing Foundation's <a
            href="https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships/fellowships-2024">Annual Fellowship</a> with Palestine
        Online, in hopes of getting support for the continual development and expansion of the project. Since this was
        already an existing work, my proposal consisted of improvements and laying additional foundation to encourage
        the future viability of the archive, compiled from observations of its needs from my continued work:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            UI interface updates to support a variety of contexts on the site (installation and mobile version)
        </li>
        <li>
            More efficient and methodical scraping of Wayback Machine websites
        </li>
        <li>
            Further exploration of Palestine Online in educational and arts programming
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I was lucky enough to be paired with designer and artist <a href="https://zai.zone/">Zainab Aliyu</a> as my mentor
    for the fellowship, who brought with her expertise in reimagining expansive archives of the global south in digital
    form, which maintain reverence for their source materials while also creatively reconfiguring the bounds and
    presentation of the web browser. Her attention to detail (at the end of the fellowship, we've now accumulated
    countless hours nitpicking over where to best place buttons and other nav) was much appreciated and integral to the
    improved design of the archive.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Bookkeeping</h2>
    <p>
        After meeting with Zainab for the first time and presenting my hodge podge of ideas, we decided to compile all
        of Palestine Online's website info onto a <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR3DsMusqOliGWsbxVuxFoQlwJAkBpSOvMDJUMvhhOLIaodBrwt0ep6d06wWKWVmQj8S_ZP7L-rqX9G/pubhtml">spreadsheet</a>,
        to have a better sense of how to organize the websites and also keep track of what steps need to be taken to
        gradually expand the archive's roster.
    </p>
    <h2>Navigation Changes</h2>
    <p>
        Palestine Online's previous version was organized in a singular, thematic structure taken from the
        lecture/walkthrough format it was adapted from - a table of contents on the front page, and two green arrows on
        both sides of the window to navigate across the websites in the table's order. From Zai's perspective, this
        layout was easily overlooked, confusingly redundant, and too similar to the "Global" navigation green buttons,
        so we decided a replacement for site navigation was a good initial improvement. Exploring different options
        including an expanding sidebar and a tab system, I decided that a dropdown menu on the top nav would be the
        best, resembling a URL bar which users can easily identify as a global point of navigation. Opening this "URL
        bar" reveals sites nested in categories across multiple themes, which are more flexible than the original rigid
        linear table of contents. I also revamped the config of this menu from a solely linear array of objects to this
        array and a companion nested "category" object, to allow easy changes.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Full Screen Mode</h2>
    <p>
        For Crystal Clear, I built an instance of Palestine Online from the ground up, meant to be displayed for full
        screen presentation on a period correct, lower resolution display for immersion. I took note of the importance
        of a solution for easier public installation that is not (physical, not web) site-specific, and for the
        fellowship, decided to experiment with implementing this display mode right into the main project, especially
        now that all site navigation was contained within the window. This was as simple as making the window full
        screen when the breakpoint matches a ~4:3 aspect ratio at ~1024x768.
    </p>

        <img src="processing-org-doc-images/p5-fullscreen.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Full Screen on a CRT Monitor</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Mobile Version</h2>
    <p>
        Though I stressed the use of Palestine Online as a Desktop first archive, meant to be browsed in a viewport
        which closely simulates the original layout that the sites in the archive would have had, I could not discount
        the importance of mobile as a platform many users browse web content on, and which is crucially proximate to
        sharing capabilties on social media, messaging, etc. <br><br>

        I initially imagined a simple full screen viewport of the selected website, and a floating menu which would stay
        fixed as the site viewport is scrolled, swiped, and pinched to zoom. However, this proved near impossible with
        the limitations of HTML and CSS, especially for zooming, as the whole website including the UI would zoom on
        pinch. Experimenting with alternatives, I landed on disabling pinch to zoom on mobile entirely and using CSS
        Scale to simulate a zoom. By accident, I found that this method also directly manipulates the webpage DOM, and
        many simpler websites of this time could be scaled up to pseudo native mobile versions, and scaled down to allow
        a birds-eye examination of the structure of these early sites, now providing a new dimension of interactivity
        that adds depth to the mobile experience, rather than compromises. I packaged this interaction into a css
        slider, a tactile UI element whose linearity refers back to the simpler design language this project pays homage
        to. <br><br>

        With this new central nav feature on mobile in place, I decided to build out the rest of the mobile interface as
        an alternate reality imagining of how user interfaces could have taken a turn another way at the beginning of
        the 21st century. With Zai, I continued developing an interface that reappropriates the clear, simple design
        language of Windows 98, and overlays them on top of modern layouts as a sort of Détournement, emulating safari
        with address bar at the top, and nav, share, other buttons at the bottom. With zoom disabled, and the site
        essentially a single page web app (SPA), I realized I could configure the website to be "installable" as a <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA) on
        iPhone and Android, so the interface could take up the whole screen, and effectively be a reskinned, sandboxed
        web browser.

    <h2>Palestine Online as an educational tool</h2>

    <p>
        I had been wanting to introduce Palestine Online to younger audiences for a while - I saw potential in such a
        resource's ability to aid in teaching kids about history, history of technology and the internet, and software
        and creative coding - especially to Arab or Muslim youth who are more familiar with the history and occupation
        of Palestine. I was lucky to have recently met my friend Gufran, who works with a Muslim Youth Program in Bay
        Ridge, Brooklyn, and we collaborated to organize three Palestine Online workshops as part of this program,
        involving a number of young adults aged 12-18. <br><br>

        I went into the first workship with a loose agenda, opening with introductions and gauging students' knowledge
        and experience with the internet and social media, and other content on it today, and how the internet has been
        a central medium for hearing Palestinian voices. Students offered great observations about censorship on social
        media, the homogoneous structure and appearance of the feeds we interact with, and how they use the internet,
        which segued into a dive into Palestine Online, and my goals/perspectives in making the archive. <br><br>
        </p>

            <figcaption>Workshop in progress!</figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
        I was interested in learning and examining what would draw a young audience to Palestine Online, and to
        potential similar projects, and noted that the project's interdisciplinary nature led to discussions and demos
        in all directions - we talked about history, parents, access, questions about the code behind the project and
        how to use Wayback Machine, I live coded the "share" feature... <br><br>
        Some students who had coding experience or goals of pursuing engineering had sotware specific questions:
        iframes, how the web works, web hosting, etc. The workshops shined optimistic potential of Palestine Online as a
        multifaceted teaching tool that engages younger students with an unfamiliar digital world (especially in an era
        with a newfound fear of declining literacy and increasing internet usage), and invites discussion of so many
        tightly and loosely related subjects - and the possibility of orgs like the Processing Foundation engaging in
        community building efforts through novel code, tech, and art education.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Scraping From the Internet Archive</h2>
    <p>
        Palestine Online's websites are discovered on, and pieced together entirely from, the Internet Archive's Wayback
        Machine. The original goal for the archive was to have downloaded copies of each website (at least, every page
        on it that still exists on the Wayback Machine), for quick loading, offline access, and solidity of the archive.
        However, as the few open source tools that offer out of the box scraping of the Wayback Machine required heavy
        intervention and were often ineffective against bot detection, I started simply linking the original hosted
        websites on the Wayback Machine through cross origin access within palestineonline.net's iframe. This worked in
        a pinch, but I found during larger workshops that Internet Archive (understandably) would start rate limiting
        users on IP Addresses, interfering with access. Also, the recent hack and outtage of the Internet Archive shows
        that even this behemoth of a service is not immune to going down, and for the permanence of the archive and its
        guaranteed access, it is vital to have as much of these sites downloaded as possible, and having a consistent,
        methodical way to do so. <br><br>

        Though a secondary goal for the fellowship, I began exploring the creation of a custom crawler to fulfill my
        needs for Palestine Online. Forgoing simple requests which are easily caught by bot detection, I explored modern
        headless browser and web crawler libraries in JS - specifically <a href="https://crawlee.dev/">Crawlee</a> and
        <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>, to build a scraper which can reliably and discreetly collect
        all the files I need (html pages, as well as images, fonts, audio files, etc.) for long term preservation of
        each site to the fullest extent possible. After the fellowship, I aim to continue refining the new scraper I
        have started building, and adding other necessary interventions such as converting the plethora of encodings on
        the old webpages to the now standard unicode, to confirm that special characters and non-english langauges (esp.
        Arabic) are preserved forever.
    </p>


    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        This fellowship has been a vital opportunity to expand and refine Palestine Online, and secure the groundwork
        for its consistent future development. After the end of the fellowship I hope to continue this work by:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Organizing more public exhibitions and installations of Palestine Online across arts institutions, Arab and
            Muslim organizations, educational spaces, really anywhere
        <li>
            Refine palestineonline.net's frontend and the (still WIP) Wayback Machine scrapers into an open source
            toolset for others to compile and build old web archives for their own uses
        </li>
        <li>
            As more websites are scraped and downloaded, create an Image Search to browse through the archive via visual
            elements
        </li>
        <li>
            Enlist volunteers to help write "info" pages for individual sites in the archive, which provide another
            layer of navigation and guide
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
