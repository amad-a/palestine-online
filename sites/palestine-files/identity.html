by Mahmoud Darwish

Record!
I am an Arab
and my identity card is number 
			fifty thousand
I have eight children
and the ninth
			is coming in midsummer
Will you be angry!

Record!
I am an Arab
a stonecutter at a quarry.
I have eight children
I must get bread,
garments 
and books
from the rocks --
			I do not supplicate
			charity at your doors
Nor do I belittle myself 
at the footsteps 
of your chamber
So will you be angry?

Record!
I am an Arab
The color of my hair - is black
The color of my eyes - is brown
And my distinctive features:
			The head-dress is kuffiya, hatta wi'gal
			And the hand is solid 
			like a rock
My favorite meal
is olive oil and zatar
And my address:
			a village - isolated and deserted
			where the streets 
			have no names
	where the men work
	in the fields and quarries
Will you be angry?

Record! 
I am an Arab
without a name - without title
patient in a country
with people enraged
My roots - 
			were entrenched before the 
			birth of time
			and before the opening of
			the eras
			before the olive trees, 
			the pines, the grass
My father descends from the family of the plow
	not from the privileged class
And my grandfather 
was a farmer
			neither well bred 
			nor well born
And my house -
			is like a watchman's hut
			made of branches and cane
This is my status
Does it satisfy you?
I have a name but no title.

Record!!
I am an Arab
You have stolen the orchards
of my ancestors and the land
which I cultivated
along with my children
You've left nothing for my children
			except those rocks
But I've heard
You'll take away
Even the rocks.

Therefore!
Record on top of first page
I do not hate man
Nor do I encroach
But if I become hungry
The usurper's flesh will be my food
Beware - Beware - of my hunger
and my anger!</PRE>
