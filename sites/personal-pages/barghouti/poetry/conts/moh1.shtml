<font size=+2>LOVE SONG FOR PALESTINE</font><br><BR>
Oh, Palestine<br>
that heart of yours<br>
made out of gold<br>
made out of jewels.<br><BR>
Oh, Palestine<br>
my Palestine<br>
the land of olives<br>
the land of vine.<br><BR>
Oh Palestine<br>
just tell me now<br>
what took so long<br>
for me to vow.<br><BR>
My love for you<br>
is ever so great<br>
this is my story<br>
I'll tell it straight.<br><BR>
Your city of peace<br>
the city of love<br>
with its olive branch<br>
carried by a dove.<br><BR>
Deep in my heart<br>
deep in my soul<br>
your cities of love<br>
I miss them all.<br><BR>
I come to you<br>
with an open arm<br>
I miss you true<br>
and miss your charm.<br><BR>
You gave me love<br>
and lots of hope<br>
with my loneliness<br>
I must cope.<br><BR>
I have no reason<br>
for being cruel<br>
since I had left you<br>
I felt like a fool.<br><BR>
But I promise you now<br>
in all God's might<br>
you won't be abandoned<br>
day or night.<br><BR>
You will be free<br>
and will be loved<br>
you won't be forgotten<br>
you won't be shoved.<br><BR>
This song is yours<br>
for being mine<br>
my love for you<br>
will always shine.<br><BR>
I will be there<br>
always be yours<br>
in your mountains<br>
on your shores.<br><BR>
From now on<br>
my dear Palestine<br>
I will be yours<br>
and you'll be mine.<br><BR>
No more good-byes<br>
no more so-long<br>
we will remain<br>
together<br>
FOR&nbsp; LONG.<br>
