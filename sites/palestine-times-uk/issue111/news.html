<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Muslim David trounces Zionist Goliath near Nablus</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><em><strong>Hebron- From Khalid Amayreh</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas Mujahideen or &#147;freedom fighters&#148; dealt a huge blow to an
Israeli army elitist undercover unit on 27 August when Israeli soldiers disguised as Arabs
raided the village of Aseera al-Shamailya near Nablus, 100 kilometres north of Jerusalem,
for the purpose of killing a Hamas fugitive.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The soldiers, who belonged to the notorious murderous unit code-named
&#147;Duvedevan&#148; (Cherry), entered the village shortly after the fall of darkness for
the purpose of &#147;liquidating&#148; Mahmoud Abu Hannoud, Hamas&#146; top guerrilla in
the West Bank. (It is believed that soldiers of the same unit were involved in the murder
of the 73-year-old mukhtar of the village of<br>
Sarda, Mahmoud Abdullah, on 15 August, during what the Hebrew press called a secret drill
to storm Palestinian villages.) </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, the soldiers opened fire randomly at a number of houses,
suggesting that they didn&#146;t know the exact whereabouts of Abu Hannoud.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least two villagers were injured, one of them is Nidal Daghlas, a
schoolteacher whom the Israeli army later branded as &#147;terrorist.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Daghlas sustained moderate wounds, and the Zionist soldiers refused to
allow first aid to be given to him, allowing him to bleed very badly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It seemed that somehow Abu Hannoud had received word&#150;probably from a
double collaborator&#150;that Israelis were in town and that their intention was to kill
him. This gave the Islamist fighter time to think and flee to Nablus, 3 kilometres away.
Nablus is under full PA control and is effectively off limits to the Israeli army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Abu Hannoud moved extremely cautiously from his hideout, heading for
Nablus, he apparently encountered and surprised four of the unit&#146;s soldiers, who must
have thought that he was still in the house. He opened fire at them, killing three
soldiers and seriously injuring a fourth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Hannoud was also lightly to moderately injured in the shoulder and in
the arm, but that did not prevent him for fleeing the site, taking advantage of the dense
olive orchards which gave him cover against the Israeli helicopters that were searching
for him with flares and laser lights. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After a laborious and extremely risky walk-and-hide manoeuvre, Abu Hannoud
was able to reach the closest PA police roadblock. There, Abu Hannoud was taken to
hospital, thus escaping miraculously from what looked like an inescapable death.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army has suggested that the three soldiers might have been
killed by friendly fire, a suggestion the local villagers dismiss as a ruse to boost the
morale of the Israeli public. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the two-hour episode, many villagers took to the streets, shouting
&#147;God is Great&#148; and hurling stones at the soldiers. The ensuing commotion, said
one source at Aseera Shamaliya, was instrumental in confusing the Israelis and
consequently enabling Abu Hannoud to escape to Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Stunned by the death of the three soldiers, the Israeli army called in
three helicopter gunships which trained spotlights on the houses and the adjacent fields
in an effort to locate Abu Hannoud, but, of course, to no avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having failed to apprehend the Islamist fighter, the army, which called in
troop reinforcements, conducted a house-to-house search in the village, harassing and
terrorizing residents. Later on, an army bulldozer levelled the house of the schoolteacher
Daghlas, without giving the family<br>
a chance to remove their furniture or their belongings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to eyewitnesses, Israeli soldiers beat Daghalas mercilessly on
the spot, despite his injury, to extract information from him on the whereabouts of Abu
Hannoud. Daghlas repeatedly told the soldiers that he had not seen anything. He was later
transferred to a helicopter and taken to an unknown destination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to Daghlas, the occupation authorities arrested three citizens
from the village. They are the imam of the local mosque, Sheikh Dhirar Hamadneh, Ahmed
Khalil and Abdullah Odeh.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel accuses Abu Hannoud of masterminding a number of suicidal bomb
attacks in Jerusalem which left many Israelis dead and injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government demanded that the PA extradite Abu Hannoud to
Israel to stand trial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Israeli request was flatly rejected by the PA security chief
in the West Bank, Jebril Rajoub, who remarked that &#147;only over our dead bodies will we
hand him to the Israelis.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA has never formally handed over any Hamas fighters to Israel since
this would cause a great embarrassment for the PA and portray it as a bunch of
collaborators working for Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, the PA said it would try Abu Hannoud before its notorious
&#147;State Security Court&#148; for &#147;endangering Palestinian national
interests.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, following the battle of Aseera Shamaliya, and in an apparent
effort to obtain a certificate of good conduct from the Zionists, PA security agencies
launched a campaign of arrests among Hamas supporters at the Najah University.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources in Nablus, the Preventive Security and
the Mukhbarat (intelligence) arrested as many as 15 Islamist students on suspicion of
having connections with Abu Hannoud.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The arrests were apparently coordinated with another campaign of arrests
targeting Islamist students by the Israeli occupation authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The semi-official Palestinian daily, <i>al-Ayyam</i>, reported on Tuesday,
29 August, that the Israeli army arrested as many as 25 Palestinian university students
studying at Najah University in Nablus and Al-Quds universities in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is a strong security and intelligence coordination between the two
sides, and it is mainly targeted against the Islamists who oppose Yasser Arafat&#146;s
capitulatory policies <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Hamas praised Abu Hannoud&#146;s &#147;bravery and
heroism&#148; in the face of hundreds of Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas also held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the safety and
well-being of Abu Hannoud.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas spokesman in Gaza Mahmoud al-Zahhar censured the PA saying,
&#147;Those heroes should be treated with utmost respect, not thrown into jail.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The movement issued a detailed <i>communiqué</i> on 28 August, vowing to
continue in the path of struggle and Jihad until Muslims recovered their rights from
Zionist hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloody encounter at Aseera Shamaliya comes at a time when
Israeli-Palestinian contention over the paramount issue of Jerusalem is rising, and with
the peace process at a real crossroad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas and the Islamic Jihad have recently threatened to launch an
&#147;all-out&#148; war against Israel if Jewish groups continue to encroach upon Muslim
holy places at Jerusalem&#146;s Haram al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 25 August, thousands of Islamists in Nablus and Amman took to the
streets to warn the PA as well as other Arab regimes against accepting any agreement that
would leave East Jerusalem, particularly the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, in
Israeli hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Observers in Palestine believe the latest episode at Aseera Shamaliya
could induce more Palestinian and Arab youths to join the ranks of Hamas, especially if
the peace process ended in a dead end, a prospect that is not very unlikely given the
present impasse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Lawyer Husam Arafat has declared that a team composed of many
Palestinian lawyers was formed to defend the Qassam Brigades commander Mahmoud Abu
Hannoud, who was expected to stand trial at the Palestinian Authority&#146;s State
Security Court.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, spokesman for the team, said the lawyers called for forming the
team after the PA declared it would try him before the State Security Court.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA police official Ghazi Jibali and attorney-general Khaled Al-Qudra had
said that Abu Hannoud would stand trial on Tuesday, 29 August.</p>

<p>Arafat underlined that many lawyers had volunteered to defend Abu Hannoud and that his
team would soon hold a press conference to explain its defense plan to the public.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Jerusalem, the crux of the matter</font></b></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli authorities reopened Jerusalem&#146;s Haram Al-Sharif to visitors
on 14 August following a four-day closure in the aftermath of clashes between Jewish
extremists and Palestinian Muslims. The site, at which the Al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock
mosques are located, is considered the third holiest shrine in Islam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clashes erupted when thousands of Jews gathered on the Haram Al-Sharif
grounds to commemorate the &#147;annual day of sorrow,&#148; marking the destruction of
the second Jewish temple which some Jews believed to have stood at the same site.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, almost 30 years of excavations in and around the area failed to
produce any tangible proof that the temple is beneath the Aqsa Mosque, a fact recognized
by many Jewish experts on archaeology. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The extremists, representing a myriad of religious groups, did not even
try to hide their goal. Converging at one of the gates of the Haram Al-Sharif, they
shouted, &#147;Let us rebuild the temple.&#148; Eventually, the throngs were forced out by
Palestinians, but not before making their point. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only a few days earlier, discussions by Israel&#146;s High Rabbinate
regarding a proposal to build a large synagogue in the heart of the Haram Al-Sharif were
postponed until &#147;a more appropriate time.&#148; Debate over the proposal was believed
to have been shelved owing to behind-the-scenes pressure from the Israeli government,
mindful of the likelihood of angry reactions by Palestinian Muslims. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new synagogue was suggested by the Rabbi of Haifa, Yoshaf Hacohen.
According to Hacohen, this project would &#147;enable Jews to gain a foothold at the
Temple Mount.&#148; In the view of Muslims world-wide, a &#147;foothold&#148; would only
be a prelude to demolishing Al-Aqsa Mosque and building a synagogue in its place. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Officially, successive Israeli governments have refrained from taking
concrete steps to alter the status quo at Haram Al-Sharif, prevailing since Israel
occupied the area in 1967, mainly owing to the overwhelming religious sensitivity
surrounding the issue. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, with Jerusalem currently the focus of Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, and with the Palestinians and the Muslim world insisting that the city
become the capital of a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it seems the
Israeli government is beginning to reconsider its erstwhile policy on that matter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A manifestation of that change of policy on the Haram Al-Sharif occurred
at Camp David when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak reportedly proposed to Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat that in the context of a final settlement for the Old
City of Jerusalem, Israel should control the area &#147;underneath&#148; the two mosques
on the Haram Al-Sharif property. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak never explained exactly what he meant by controlling the area
underneath the mosques, a task which he apparently left to Jewish extremists and the High
Rabbinate to clarify &#147;at the appropriate time.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jews pray at the Western Wall, behind which the Dome of the Rock and the
al-Aqsa Mosque compound can be seen. The mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam,
was reopened recently after visitors were barred from entry during the week preceding
because of minor clashes between Jewish extremists and Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The proposal reportedly shocked the Palestinian leadership as it was the
first time an Israeli Prime Minister came so close to articulating Jewish extremists&#146;
interest in demolishing the al-Aqsa Mosque. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat was said to have firmly told Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton
that no Arab or Muslim leader could sign away the al-Aqsa Mosque, a stance reiterated by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak several times in recent days. Predictably, Palestinian
leaders from across the political spectrum understood the message inherent in the ominous
proposal. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a criminal proposal&#150;a direct invitation to war,&#148;
said Jerusalem&#146;s mufti, Ikrema Sabri, in reaction to the proposal, adding that
&#147;these criminal intentions could set the entire region on fire because Muslims are
not going to sit idle while their holy places are taken away from them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri told reporters in Jerusalem that al-Aqsa Mosque &#147;was, is and
always will be an exclusively Islamic holy place that belongs to the entire Muslim nation.
It is an integral part of the Muslim faith.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An even stronger reaction came from Hamas, whose founder and leader,
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, warned that &#147;the destruction of al-Aqsa Mosque would be followed
by the destruction of Israel. We&#146;ll set Israel on fire if they dare to attack al-Aqsa
Mosque.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the League of Palestine&#146;s Islamic Religious Scholars
issued a strongly worded statement on 10 August, warning Jews against playing with fire. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Calling the proposal a blatant challenge to a billion-and-a-half Muslims
which flies in the face of all religious, moral and legal norms, the League&#146;s
statement warned Muslims that al-Aqsa Mosque was in grave danger. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Attempts by extremist Jewish groups to enter the area are not new to the
Palestinians. The most notorious of these occurred in 1990 when an organization called
Solomon&#146;s Group entered the Haram Al-Sharif, an action that led to skirmishes and
intervention by Israeli police in violation of unofficial arrangements for protecting the
area. As clashes escalated, 17 Muslims were killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The current showdown over the Haram Al-Sharif serves to highlight the
religious dimension of the conflict in Palestine. This situation was further complicated
by the recent manifestly racist slurs by the mentor of the Israeli ultra-orthodox Shas
Party in which he called Arabs &#147;snakes&#148; and said that God regretted having
created them.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">PA gives green light to <br>
&#147;beauty contest&#148; in West Bank</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The Palestinian Authority is reportedly allowing
a tourist company with Israeli connections to organize a so-called &#147;beauty
contest&#148; in Ramallah on the West Bank in October, according to reports published in
the Palestinian Arabic press.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Ramallah-based Arabic daily <i>al-Ayyam</i> reported on 10 August that
the PA tourism ministry approved plans to that effect. The paper reported that the
ministry agreed in principle to allow the organizers to go ahead. However, the tourism
ministry denied any involvement, accusing the organizer of lying.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Those people are spreading lies about us...we have never given them
any consent in this regard and we published a statement to that effect in the main
dailies,&#148; said Tawfik Abu Eita, the acting minister of tourism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I can assure you that the Ministry of Tourism has nothing to do with
these ads,&#148; he added during a telephone interview from his office in Bethlehem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Eita, however, did not rule out the possibility that the organizer
received an okay from some influential person in the tourism ministry.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;He might have got an okay behind our back...everything is possible,
but this okay will be worthless,&#148; said Abu Eita.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The paper said the contest would be held on 10 October, nearly two weeks
after the erstwhile deadline for the declaration of Palestinian Statehood. The organizer
of the contest, a private tourist company named Magic Touch, defended the organization of
a beauty contest in the mostly conservative Palestinian society.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A company official argued that the organization of the contest would be
conducive to the establishment of the Palestinian State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked how promiscuous acts as such would or could expedite the
establishment of Palestinian statehood, the official said, &#147;It depends on how you
view it...you think it is profanity, we think it is art.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The official, Hussam Mayeer, was quoted as saying that &#147;there is no
conflict between Palestinian traditions and beauty queen contests.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, several Palestinian feminist leaders lambasted the planned event
as &#147;visual prostitution&#148; and &#147;injurious to women&#146;s dignity, honour and
image.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a blind imitation of the West&#133;.this is totally
unacceptable,&#148; said Zainab Ghenemi, Public Relations Officer at the PA Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I don&#146;t know how this nudity will advance the cause of women in
Palestine...I fail to understand how stripping women from their clothes in full daylight
and exposing their fine parts to the hungry eyes of spectators can be considered a form of
art.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi also criticized plans to that effect
saying, &#147;This is not going to advance the cause of women; it will only assert
negative stereotypes about women.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ashrawi indirectly accused the organizers of viewing women as merely
sexual objects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I don&#146;t know why we should seek to perpetuate the concept that
the woman is only a commodity.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Mufti of Palestine, Ikrema Sabri, castigated the holding of beauty
contests as &#147;a manifestation of a promiscuous culture.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Islam, and I understand other religions as well, prohibits
this form of nudity and promiscuity; I call on the organizer to reconsider this vile
act.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri, a PA official, reportedly pressed the tourism ministry to cancel
the event, arguing that the holding of such profanity in Palestine&#150;not far away from
the Aqsa Mosque&#150;would put the Palestinian people to shame and besmirch its holy
struggle for liberation and freedom.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Palestinian Islamic leaders also lashed out at the PA for allowing
or at least acquiescing to the scheme. Sheikh Nayef Rajoub opined that those who are
promoting promiscuity in Palestine were Zionist tools to spread moral decay and corruption
among our people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Their goal is to corrupt the Palestinian woman and strip her of
chastity and dignity,&#148; he said, adding that &#147;this has always been an undeclared
Zionist goal...and now we have Palestinians who are readily willing to carry it out.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajoub pointed out that Israel and Zionists in general feel deeply
satisfied when they see Palestinian women cast off their modesty and Hijab. He pointed out
that the former Israeli premier Shimon Peres cited the number of Gazan women who walked in
the streets without their head-dress as proof of the success of the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since its establishment nearly six years ago, the PA has been encouraging
lax lifestyles among Palestinians. Three years ago, the PA, in cooperation with Israeli
and Austrian firms, built a large casino in Jericho, which observers say has ruined the
lives of many Israeli and Palestinians alike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, the mayor of Um al-Fahem, Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah, said in an
interview with the Hebron-based <i>Hebron Times</i>, published on 9 August, that scores of
Arab businessmen lost all their money and were forced to turn to charity groups in his
town for food. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Open letter to the people of Gaza</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Editor: Following is a letter to the Palestinian People forwarded by the
family of the Late Dr. David C. Dorr concerning his life and service and his appreciation
for the friendship, love and hospitality found among the people of Gaza. On behalf of the
Palestinian People, The Palestine Times would like to convey its deep condolences to the
family of Dr. Dorr, who dedicated several years of his life to serving Palestinians in
Gaza.</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. David C. Dorr, who worked as a surgeon at the Baptist Hospital in
Gaza during the period 1959-1968, died on Father&#146;s Day, 18 June 2000 surrounded by
his family. One of his dying wishes was to extend to the many friends, acquaintances and
in general to the people of the Gaza Strip his thanks and appreciation for the warmth,
kindness and hospitality extended to him and his family during his time among them. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were many Palestinian children born through the skill of his
hands and many men and women alive today because of his surgical gifts given to serve
mankind. Even those who knew and worked with him may not have known the road that brought
him to Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Dorr was born in Washington, DC to Colonel Philip Dorr and his
wife Ruby. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon graduation from high school, David entered Mars Hill College and
then in August of 1943 enlisted in the United States Air Corps. He served as a radar
operator on a B-29. For 30 missions over Japan and helping his teammates under fire, he
was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a diary, which he kept during this time, he tells of an unusual
life-changing experience. It was on a visit to the Air Corps cemetery that he saw some
crewmen taking a picture of a recently dug grave. &#147;We&#146;re taking a picture of our
friend&#146;s grave for his mother,&#148; they said. David was deeply moved. He thought of
the son that would not return home and the mother that would have only a picture of a
marker in a military cemetery to remind her of him.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;If I am fortunate enough to return home, &#147; he writes in his
diary, &#147;I must do something worthwhile with my life.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He did not forget this resolve. When he returned to the States, he
entered Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and then was accepted in the
Johns Hopkins Medical School.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this time, he married Roberta Kells who had similar aspirations of
service.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He noted and was interested that Southern Baptists were opening
hospitals in various countries. David volunteered to go and serve where his skills were
most needed as soon as he was finished with his internship and residency.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, tragedy struck. It was at the end of his second year of
residency that doctors discovered he had Hodgkin&#146;s disease. The little family with
two small boys and a new daughter were devastated. All thoughts of Christian service had
to be canceled. He was advised to stay on and complete the four-year surgical residency
while under medical observation. There was no treatment for Hodgkin&#146;s at that time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Miraculously, through prayer and trusting obedience to God, the
Hodgkin&#146;s disease disappeared. Just as the residency programme came to an end and he
was ready to go into practice, he learned that Baptists had taken over a surgical hospital
on the Gaza Strip and needed surgeons. He packed up his family and moved to the Gaza Strip
where he spent the next 11 years working among Palestinian refugees. The years spent in
Gaza, including the experiences shared in the 1967 war, were some of the most rewarding
years of his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following his time in Gaza, he transferred to a new hospital that had
just opened in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1975, when Roberta developed a serious back problem that resulted in
surgery, the family had to leave Yemen for the United States. They did not return to the
Washington, DC area but rather settled in East Tennessee. David served in many hospitals
in East Tennessee and finally retired in 1988 owing to the complications of
Parkinson&#146;s disease.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So it is with great warmth and thanks that his family conveys these
sentiments to the people of Gaza whom he dearly loved and cared so much about.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God Bless you,</p>

Dr. Rantisi in PA prison</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza - </b>A delegation of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has
visited on Monday, 28 August, Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi, Hamas prominent leader in Gaza who
has been detained by the Palestinian Authority police since the end of July for delivering
press statements criticizing the Palestinian political situation and the Camp David talks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Ismail Hanneya, director of the office of Hamas founder Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, said the visit to Dr. Rantisi was made in coordination with PA police
commander Ghazi Jibali and its aim was to ensure he was in a safe condition behind bars.
He added that Rantisi enjoyed a state of high morale and good health. Hanneya said that
Rantisi spent his time reading the holy Qur&#146;an and a number of political and other
books.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The delegation conveyed greetings of Sheikh Yassin and Hamas members to
Rantisi along with their prayers for his release, Hanneya said, adding that Rantisi
reciprocated the greetings and affirmed that victory came with patience. Hanneya affirmed
that senior PA officials had assured Hamas that the case of Dr. Rantisi would soon be
resolved, especially since he did not commit any legal or non-legal violation and that his
statements fell in line with freedom of expression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hamas Movement stressed the importance of releasing Dr. Rantisi and
all remaining detainees in PA jails, he said, adding that an agreement was reached with
Jibali allowing family members of Dr. Rantisi to visit him especially since none of them
have been allowed to visit him from the time of his arrest.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Sheikh Yassin: Israel will <br>
disappear in a few decades</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin has predicted that the Zionist regime (Israel) will cease to exist in a few
decades. Speaking on a Sharja satellite TV programme on 21 August, Sheikh Yassin said the
disappearance of Israel was a religious and historical eventuality.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The Qur&#146;an says that very clearly in Surat
Isra&#146;a&#133;I have no doubt that this will happen in a few decades, certainly this
century,&#148; said Yassin during a special show marking the passage of 31 years since an
Australian Zionist terrorist set fire to al-Masjidul Aqsa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Islamist leader pointed out that he was optimistic that
Arabs and Muslims were increasingly aware of the grave dangers surrounding the Aqsa
Mosque, Islam&#146;s third holiest site.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Zionists want to destroy the Mosque in order to build their
mythological temple&#133;this should be clear to us all.&#148; Yassin stressed that the
path of resistance and Jihad was the only means to liberate Palestine, saying that this
method proved its validity in South Lebanon where a small band of dedicated and faithful
men drove the mighty Zionist army out of their country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He also called on Arab regimes to wake up, because the Zionists aim to
swallow the entire Arab world, not just Palestine. &#147;There is going to be a larger
confrontation, and we&#146;d better be prepared for it now.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Mufti of Jerusalem and the whole of Palestine, Ikrema Sabri spoke
during the same show, saying that Zionist attacks on Jerusalem&#146;s Haram al-Sharif
increased in frequency in the last few years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that the recent decision by the Zionist regime&#146;s high
rabbinate to discuss the prospects of building a synagogue within the confines of the
Haram al-Sharif signalled a serious shift in Zionist designs against Islam&#146;s third
holiest shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, thousands of Islamists continued to march in the streets of the
West Bank, Gaza and Jordan as well as other parts of the Arab-Muslim world, warning
against Zionist designs against the Aqsa Mosque and al-Quds al-Sharif in general.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Nablus, the largest town in the West Bank, thousands of Hamas
supporters took to the streets following the Friday congregational prayers on 25 August,
shouting Islamic slogans and demanding a stronger Arab-Muslim stance on Jerusalem. The
estimated 5,000 demonstrators carried placards reading &#147;Yes to our Aqsa, no to their
temple.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas spokesman in Nablus, Jamal Salim, warned Muslims all over the world
that Islam&#146;s third holiest shrine was facing &#147;real dangers&#148; saying the
&#147;Jews are waiting for the opportune moment to demolish al-Aqsa.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Their frequent encroachments are feelers aimed at testing our
resolve...we must demonstrate to them by deeds and words that this is the ultimate red
line.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A stronger warning came from Sheikh Hamed al-Beitawi, the head of the
League of Palestine Muslim Ulema, the Rabitat Ulema Falastin. He said Israel and the Jews
would regret the day they were born if they decided to tamper with al-Masjidul Aqsa.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The destruction of al-Masjidul Aqsa would ultimately lead to
the destruction of Israel,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The demonstrators called on Arabs and Muslims everywhere to take to the
streets and to hold protests to demonstrate their concern for Jerusalem, the first Qibla
of Islam and the third holiest Islamic shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before departing, the huge multitude declared in unison their commitment
to al-Masjidul Aqsa, swearing by God Almighty to defend and protect the Mosque with their
blood and souls.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several large demonstrations had earlier taken place in several towns in
the West Bank where pledges were made to defend al-Aqsa with blood and souls.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Concomitant demonstrations by Jordanian Islamists took place in Amman,
Irbid and Zarqa where members of the Islamic Action Front and the Muslim Brotherhood took
to the streets after Friday prayers, warning the Islamic Umma against the dangers
surrounding Jerusalem and al-Masjidul Aqsa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 25 August, as many as 10,000 Jordanian Islamists marched in Amman,
warning the Palestinian Authority against compromising Muslim rights in Jerusalem. Several
Islamic speakers addressed the protesters, including Abdul Majid Ethneibat,
Director-General of the Islamic Action Front, and Abdul Latif Arabiyat, the former speaker
of the Jordanian parliament.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabiyat warned against normalization with the Zionist regime, saying
&#147;normalization means lending legitimacy to the Zionist occupation of Jerusalem and
al-Masjidul Aqsa.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is expected that other protests will take place in the next few weeks
and months despite American and Zionist pressure on the obsequious Jordanian government to
suppress anti-Zionist protests, particularly those organized by the Islamists. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Armuti, after returning from a meeting with the Hamas leaders in Syria,

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The Zionist occupation authorities on Tuesday, 29
August, demolished three Palestinian homes near Al-Quds, rendering three large families
homeless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to local sources, hundreds of Zionist soldiers, accompanied by a
military bulldozer, stormed the Shuf&#146;at refugee camp, 10 kilometres north of
Jerusalem, in the early morning hours on Tuesday with the intent of destroying allegedly

remaining two under construction. The three houses belong to Ali Saleh Alqam, Ahmed
Izghari and Muhammed Abu Ghaliya.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The demolition was apparently carried out as a result of the proximity of
the houses to the nearby Jewish settlement of Pisgat Ze&#146;ev. The Zionist authorities
adopt a policy of denying the Palestinians building licenses in order to check Arab
demographic growth, forcing Palestinians to risk building without receiving a license
beforehand.</p>

intentions against the Aqsa Mosque</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nablus-</b> Sheikh Hamed Beitawi, head of the Palestine League of Ulema
(religious scholars) warned that the Israelis were planning a crime against the holy Aqsa
Mosque, affirming that such a step would ignite the whole region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Beitawi, who was lecturing at the Balata refugee camp, said that Jerusalem
was the target of many Jewish attacks over the past 50 years in its capacity as a symbol
of Islamic creed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He affirmed that the current harassment against the Aqsa was not the first
of its kind but rather the latest in a series that was started by the Zionist fanatic who
tried to burn the holy Mosque 31 years ago after the occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967.
He elaborated that the Aqsa was the scene of a horrible carnage in 1990 in which scores
were martyred or wounded, and noted that the occupation authority continued to prevent
Palestinians residing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas from offering prayers in it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Sheikh warned that the holy city was the target of a ferocious Jewish
settlement campaign while at the same time high tolls are leveled against its indigenous
inhabitants along with other measures aimed at evacuating them. He said that the Zionists
were serious in building the alleged temple in place of the Aqsa after splitting the holy
place between the Muslims and Jews, similar to what they had done in the Ibrahimi Mosque
in Hebron.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Chronology of Jewish attacks and conspiracies <br>
against The Aqsa Mosque since 1967</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the seizure of Al-Quds al-Sharif (holy Jerusalem) in 1967, Jewish
groups, often through direct or indirect connivance with the government of Israel, have
been attempting relentlessly to destroy al-Masjidul Aqsa (Aqsa Mosque), using a variety of
vicious means and tactics. These range from attempting to destroy the Mosque using a
helicopter gunship to digging a tunnel beneath the Mosque, which happened in the summer of
1996.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most serious Jewish crime so far against the Mosque took place on 21
August 1969, when an Australian Christian tourist named Dennis Rohan attempted to set
al-Aqsa Mosque on fire and in the process destroyed the beautiful and priceless wood and
ivory pulpit sent from Aleppo by the Muslim ruler Saladin, as well as damaging the
Mosque&#146;s ceiling. Although the Israeli government labelled this an isolated attack by
a deranged individual, in fact the arson attack prompted the United Nations Security
Council to condemn Israel&#146;s failure to curb terrorist attacks on Islam&#146;s third
holiest shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that the UN felt it necessary to take this step demonstrates that
this action was a deliberate act of aggression carried out with the unmistakable
acquiescence of the Israeli government. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this is not the only act of Israeli aggression against the sacred
Mosque, which is the third holiest shrine in Islam after the sacred mosque in Mecca and
the Prophet&#146;s Mosque in Medina.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following are some of the crimes and ill-designs carried out by Jewish
terrorists against the Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock and other Muslim holy places in
Jerusalem:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">7 June 1967</b>: The occupation authorities confiscated the keys of the
Western Gate, also known as Bab El-Magharba, immediately after Israeli troops seized the
town from the fleeing Jordanians.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">9 June 1967</b>: The congregational Friday prayer was not held on orders
from the occupation authorities. That was the first time the Juma&#146;a prayer was not
held since the liberation of Jerusalem from the hands of the Crusades in 1167 AD. On 19
October 1990, the Juma&#146;a prayer was delayed for two hours because the occupation
authorities denied Muslim worshippers entry to the Haram compound.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">August 1967</b>: Chief Chaplain of the Armed Forces, Shlomo Goren (later
Israel&#146;s Chief Rabbi) lead 50 armed extremists onto the grounds of Haram al-Sharif.
&#147;It is a holy commandment,&#148; Goren said, &#147;for Jews to go to the Muslim
grounds, which Jews call the Temple Mount.&#148; Writing in an Israeli publication, Eti
Ronel reported, &#147;Many rabbis, including members of the Council of the Chief
Rabbinate, support..Jewish sovereignty&#148; over Haram al-Sharif.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">21 August 1969</b>: David Rohan, an Australian Christian tourist, set
al-Aqsa Mosque on fire destroying the beautiful and priceless wood and ivory pulpit sent
from Aleppo by the Muslim ruler Saladin, and also damaging the Mosque&#146;s ceiling. This
arson attack prompted the United Nations Security Council to condemn Israel&#146;s failure
to curb terrorist attacks on Islam&#146;s third holiest shrine.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">16 November 1969</b>: The Israeli occupation authorities seized the
Fakhriyya Corner on the south-western side of the Haram Al-Sharif.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">19 December 1969</b>: Four months later, a group of militant Jews storm
their way into Haram al-Sahrif in order, they claim, &#147;to conduct Hanukkah
prayers.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the <b>1970s</b>, members of the radical Gush Eminum movement began
holding underground secret meetings where they plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock.
They believed this action would compel God to send the long-awaited Messiah.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">14 August 1970</b>: The Gershon Solomon group, an ultra-fanatic group
dedicated to the so-called rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon on the site of Al-Aqsa
Mosque after it is demolished, forcibly entered the premises of the Haram, but were
repulsed by Muslims. The confrontation resulted in tens of worshipers being injured by
Israeli troop gunfire.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3 March 1971</b>: Gershon Solomon leads Temple Mount Faithful followers
onto Haram al-Sharif. After struggling with Palestinian guards, they are expelled. Three
years later (<b>3 March 1974</b>) Solomon again, with followers, storms the Mosque. Again
(<b>14 July 1978</b>) Solomon leads militant Jews onto the Islamic holy grounds.
Palestinians stage protests. Israeli troops hurl tear gas to quell the rioting.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">19 April 1980</b>: A group of Jewish Rabbis and sages held a semi-secret
conference devoted to exploring ways and means &#147;to liberate the Temple Mount from
Muslim hands.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">10 August 1980</b>: Three hundred Gush Emunim fanatics, heavily armed,
overcome Palestinian police and storm the grounds, but are later dispersed. A month later
(<b>15 September 1980</b>) armed Gush Emunim settlers associated with Stanley Goldfoot and
the Temple Mount Faithful again force their way onto the Mosque grounds. After scuffling
with police they are evicted.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">28 August 1980</b>: The Israeli occupation authorities dig a tunnel right
underneath the Mosque.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">30 March 1982</b>: Numerous letters were sent to Muslim Waqf authorities
urging them to abandon the Temple Mount and warning them of the dire consequence of their
&#147;usurpation of our Temple.&#148; The letters were written in Hebrew, English, French,
Spanish and Polish.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">11 April 1982</b>: Alan Goodman, an Israeli citizen with a U.S. passport,
marches into al-Aqsa with an M-16 rifle and opens fire on worshippers, killing 2
Palestinians and wounding close to 60 others. In <b>November 1997</b>, the Israeli
government releases Goodman. Unrepentant, Goodman boasts, &#147;I fulfilled my
mission.&#148; Since Goodman&#146;s murder spree, more than 20 religious fanatics (Meir
Kahane among them) have been caught trying to blow up al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">20 May 1982</b>: Several Zionist organizations sent death threats to Waqf
officials.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">25 July 1982</b>: Yoel Lerner, a member of the militant Meir Kahane Kach
movement, storms the Mosque grounds with plans to dynamite and destroy the Dome of the
Rock.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">10 March 1983</b>: Armed Gush Emunim fanatics climb the walls onto Haram
al-Sharif attempting to overcome security guards and take the Mosque by storm. They have
in their possession large quantities of explosives, automatic rifles and pistols.
Twenty-nine are charged and held for trial.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">26 March 1983</b>: The main entrance to Jerusalem&#146;s Waqf department
collapsed as a result of Israeli excavations underneath it.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">21 September 1983</b>: An Israeli court acquits the 29 Jewish terrorists
who six months earlier had laid siege on the Mosque.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">27 January 1984</b>: In the most ambitious plot to dynamite and destroy
the Mosque, Jewish terrorists, armed with 250 pounds of explosives, including dozens of
grenades, boxes of dynamite and 12 rounds of mortar, attempt to dynamite and destroy the
Mosque. They are led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger, one of the most militant of Jewish
extremists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also in <b>1984</b>, Rabbi Israel Ariel founded the periodical
&#147;Tzfia&#148; (Looking Ahead) to provide a public forum for discussing the rebuilding
of the Third Temple. In <b>1986</b> he opened a museum in the Old City where visitors can
see the vessels, musical instruments and priestly vestments being made for use in the
Third Temple. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">21 August 1985</b>: The Israeli police permitted Jewish extremists to hold
prayers within the confines of the Haram premises.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1994</b>: The Israelis appoint Meir Davidson, a senior official of Ateret
Cohanim, as municipal adviser of Palestinian properties. This signals the Israeli
government will work closely with an organization whose aim is the destruction of the
Mosque.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4 August 1986</b>: A group of Rabbis issued a final ruling allowing Jews
to pray at the Haram Al-Sharif and demanded the establishment of a synagogue in the area.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">12 May 1988</b>: Israeli soldiers opened fire on a peaceful Muslim march
at the Haram, killing and wounding about 100 Palestinians.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">8 October 1990</b>: A group of Gush members broke into Al-Aqsa with the
intention of laying a foundation for the Third Temple on the Haram yard. When Muslims
tried to prevent the intruders, the army attacked the worshippers, killing 21 Muslims and
injuring close to 150 others. In the meantime, the Israeli government continued a
programme of digging and excavating under Al-Aqsa in an attempt to destroy the Mosque in a
way that would make it look like an accident. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">25 July 1995</b>: The Israeli High Court of Justice issued a ruling,
allowing Jews to pray at the &#147;Temple Mount.&#148; The decision sparked widespread
protests among Muslims.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">September 1996</b>: Ateret Cohanim, funded largely through tax-exempt
dollars donated by rich American Jews, including Miami millionaire Irving Moskowitz,
opened a tunnel (excavated in secret night-time operations) that runs the length of the
Al-Aqsa complex. The controversial tunnel sparked intense fighting which claimed the lives
of 60 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers. Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu
proudly visited the tunnel, as have fundamentalist Christian leaders.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">18 October 1998</b>: Gershon Solomon, with followers waving Israeli flags
and blowing rams&#146; horns, mount a ramp to the Mosque grounds. &#147;The time has come
to rebuild the Jewish Temple,&#148; said Solomon. To underscore this point, Solomon parked
a flatbed truck carrying a 4-ton marble &#147;cornerstone&#148; for that new temple near
an Old City gate.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">10 August 2000</b>: Hundreds of East Jerusalem&#146;s Muslims repulsed
several attempts by extremist Jews to forcibly enter the Haram al-Sharif, the plaza
housing the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Scores of extremists led by Gershon
Solomon, head of the so-called Temple Mount Faithful, attempted twice to force their way
onto the Haram al-Sharif but were repulsed by Muslims who converged to the site, heeding a
call to that effect from Muslim Wakf officials. Wakf officials reportedly warned Israeli
police officials that &#147;lots of blood would be spilt&#148; if the extremists were
allowed into the Haram al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is obvious from the above examples that the Israelis have made no
secret that it wants to destroy Masjid Al-Aqsa. On <b>12 August 2000</b> during a Friday
sermon in the Aqsa Mosque, Dr. Ismael Nawahda warned, &#147;The Aqsa Mosque is saying to
you Muslims, &#145;I&#146;m in grave danger; I&#146;m in grave danger; move now before it
is too late.&#146;&#148; Nawahda said the increasing Zionist attacks on Islamic holy
places in Jerusalem would not stop unless Muslims put up a meaningful stance to Zionist
insolence and arrogance of power. &#147;We need a deliverer who will emancipate the Aqsa
from the shackles of Zionism,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most recently, Grace Halsell has written a book entitled, <i>Forcing
God&#146;s Hand</i>, which exposes the strange alliance between millions of U.S.
Christians, who make a cult worship of the land of Israel, and militant Israeli groups
dedicated to the destruction of Jerusalem&#146;s most holy Islamic shrine. She
demonstrates that millions of U.S. evangelical Christians endorse and financially support
this Jewish plan arguing that it is God&#146;s will that Al-Aqsa be destroyed to make way
for the building of the Third Temple, which will in turn usher in the second coming of
Jesus Christ. Many of the Jewish zealots are welcomed in countless U.S. pulpits, where
Christian Zionists give generous donations of money to support them in their efforts.</p>
