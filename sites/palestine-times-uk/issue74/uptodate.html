<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel demolishes more Arab Homes in Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (27  August) </FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation bulldozers destroyed three additional
Palestinian homes at the Ras al Amud neighborhood in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources in Jerusalem said two Israeli bulldozers
destroyed the three houses shortly before noon Wednesday, rendering three
families homeless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert,
justified the brutal act on the ground  that the three premises were built
without license.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Palestinians point out that licensing is only
a pretext, arguing that demolition of Arab houses in East Jerusalem, as
it is in the West Bank, is an established Israeli policy aimed at checking
Arab demographic growth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;House demolition is consistent with the undeclared
Israeli policy of preventing the Arab population in the city from exceeding
the 27% -line,&quot; said Faisal Husseini, member of the PLO executive committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Husseini pointed out that Israeli municipal authorities
in East Jerusalem refuse to issue building licenses for Palestinians inside
the city for racist reasons pertaining to the ethnic cleansing policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They don't want to see more Palestinians here,&quot;
said Husseini</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday,  a prominent Israeli journalist and writer,
Uri Avneri, disclosed that the successive Israeli governments adopted an
undeclared policy  against Arab demographic expansion and growth in East
Jerusalem soon after the Israeli occupation in June 1967.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Writing in the Hebrew daily <I>Ma'ariv, </I>Avneiri pointed
out that Labour and Likud governments alike committed themselves to maintain
the proportion of non-Jews (the Arabs) in Jerusalem at the 27 % point, the
same percentage in 1967.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with a crushing housing shortage stemming from natural
growth in their population and the scarcity of building licenses, many East
Jerusalemite Palestinians are forced to seek shelter in surrounding areas
such as Bethlehem and Ram, thus risking withdrawal of their residency rights
by the Israeli authorities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They are launching a demographic genocide against
us in the full view of the world...they don't allow us to build shelters
for our children, and when we go elsewhere to seek one, they tell us &quot;you
no longer have the right to live in Jerusalem,&quot; said Abdul Hamid Nasser
Addin,  a Jerusalemite Arab who lost his residency right in Jerusalem because
he moved to a new house in the Ram neighborhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development,  Israeli soldiers prevented a group
of Christian clergymen from reaching their church in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The clergymen, along with civic leaders and Legislative
Council members from Bethlehem, walked to the Israeli army roadblock near
the settlement of Gilo north of Bethlehem, hoping to be allowed to proceed
to Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the soldiers turned them back, threatening to
shoot them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bethlehem has been under a tight siege for a month, sparking
off violent protests by townspeople.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday,  26 August, as many as 40 school girls fainted
after their school was bombarded with tear gas shells by Israeli soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government has so far refused to lift the siege
on Bethlehem  allegedly for security reasons.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday, the Israeli War minister, Yitzhak Mordachai,
said the siege on the Palestinian town would continue for the foreseeable
future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government has been demanding that the Palestinian
Authority destroy the social, economic and educational infrastructure of
Hamas, an allusion to hospitals, schools, universities and charitable institutions
run by Islamists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, the Palestinian Authority has refused to the Zionist
dictates.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish murderer freed for &quot;psychological
reasons&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (25 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli military court decided on Sunday 24 August to
set a Jewish murderer free &quot;because he is unfit to stand trial.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, the military court in Jaffa
ruled that Noam Freidman, 19, was not responsible for his crimes against
Palestinians since he suffered psychiatric disorders rendering him unable
to realize what he was doing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Freidman, an officer in the Israeli army and member of
the racist Gush Emunim movement, opened fire from his automatic rifle at
Arab civilians in Hebron on 1 January this year, injuring six Palestinians,
one seriously.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Freidman reportedly confessed to having planned to &quot;slaughter
as many Arabs as possible in order to clean this land of non-Jews.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The murderer was overpowered by an Israeli soldier before
he could carry out his evil design.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the incident, Israeli army sources claimed that
Freidman was mentally unbalanced and trigger-happy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A concocted psychological evaluation by army psychiatrist
was hastily produced, effectively absolving the murderer of responsibility
for his crime.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources rightly argue that Israeli authorities
usually seek to justify the murder of innocent Palestinians by serving Israeli
soldiers and settlers on the ground that the perpetrators suffer from psychological
disorders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Very often, the &quot;demented perpetrators&quot; find
their way back to Israeli army units in the West Bank, preparing for new
crimes against Palestinians.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Comment on statement by the spokesman of
</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>the U.S. Department of State</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A responsible source from the Political Bureau of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has issued the following statement:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spokesman for the U.S. Department of State James Rubin
said in his comment and protest against the participation of the Hamas and
Islamic Jihad movements in the conference of the &quot;National Unity for
Confrontation of Challenges&quot;, held in Gaza and Ramallah last Wednesday
and Thursday, that &quot;We do not see any role for Hamas or the Islamic
Jihad to play; they are enemies of peace and should have no place in serious
peace talks.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas, every Palestinian, Arab, Muslim and free man in
this world has the right to wonder: Who is the real enemy of peace? Is it
Hamas and the Islamic Jihad who practice a legitimate resistance against
the Zionist Occupation that has usurped our land, made our people homeless,
insulted our religion, desecrated our holy places and committed and is still
committing dozens of ugly massacres against our innocent women, old men,
children and worshippers in mosques? Is it Hamas that defends its people
who are still suffering the most severe types of oppression, suppression,
racial discrimination, siege and starvation at the hands of the Zionist
Enemy that murdered and arrested hundreds of thousands of the Palestinian
People and which made millions of them homeless to live a life of misery
in exile camps while their homes are occupied by invading gangs who have
no right to be on the land and who were exported by the U.S. Administration
from the New York slums and from other parts of the world? Is it Hamas that
serves its oppressed people by providing them with social assistance, health
and educational services and offering them the necessities that help to
preserve their injured humanity and their right to live, while all allegations
of the U.S. Administration about human rights, justice and peace failed
to alleviate the sufferings of our people and instead supported the &quot;executioner&quot;?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We wonder who is the enemy of peace? Is it Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad or is it the Zionist existence that has a record replete with
crimes against humanity and with massacres against our members and innocent
civilians in Deir Yasseen, Qibya, Kufr Qassem, Bahrul Baqar, Al Ibrahimi
Mosque and Qana as well as many others that are still being perpetuated?
The U.S. Administration keeps itself busy imposing the security coordination
while our children and old men die of hunger or diseases at the checkpoints
of the terrorist Netanyahu in front of his cowardly soldiers. Or is it the
U.S. Administration that destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
with atomic bombs and that committed the ugliest of massacres in Vietnam,
destroying Hanoi over its people, and perpetrated murders, destruction,
state terrorism and piracy in the Far East and Latin America? Or that committed
the massacre in Al Ameriya bomb shelter against the innocent civilians in
Iraq, starving 20 million of its people and killed thousands of its children
because of the unjust sanctions? Or that destroyed the Iranian civil airplane
over the Gulf, raided the housing areas in Libya under the pretext of chasing
its president and still imposing unjust sanctions against the Libyan people?
Or that is still supporting the rebellions in South Sudan and instigating
other countries to siege and punish it unjustly just because it opted to
follow the way of real independence and freedom for its political and economic
decisions? Or that practices domination, individualism, and superiority
even against its supposed allies in Europe? Or that keeps silence about
the terrorism created by its friendly regimes while it declares war against
the liberation movements, the resistance factions and the people who seek
to obtain their freedom and independence; or that pursues and kills the
free, honest and oppressed people in this world? Or that threatens the countries
that oppose its policies under the pretext that they confiscated democracy,
while it keeps silence when its allies abuse democracy and human rights
in broad daylight?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We wonder who is the real terrorist and the enemy of peace?
Is he the one who resists the occupation and looks forward to reclaiming
the rights of freedom, justice and return? Or the one who supports the Zionist
aggression in Palestine and against Lebanon, or the one who provides it
with the machines of destruction, the billions of dollars and the political
cover-ups for its crimes and atrocities? Or the one who builds his foreign
policies on double standards and on the bias towards the aggressors? Is
the enemy of peace the one who defends the oppressed people? Or that one
who declares war against them and deprives them from their food, medicine
and children's milk? We would like to say to the Zionist and the &quot;Zionitised&quot;
powers in the U.S. Administration that Hamas, the Palestinians, Arabs and
Muslims are the true makers of a just and real peace; the peace that restores
the rights to their owners and that stops oppression, occupation and aggression.
But the humiliating peace that the U.S. Administration tries to impose on
our people and nation by force is not a peace but a humiliation of the people
and a declaration of war against rights, freedom and justice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, this false peace will not come to fruition because
it is based on oppression and because it clashes with the people's will.
The people's will is stronger than the aggression even if this aggression
is backed by super powers or empires! The peace talks, which the U.S. Administration
tries to impose by force and in accordance with the conditions of the Zionist
Enemy, do not honour Hamas. The honour and pride taken in defending the
right of our people to freedom, liberation and return is what Hamas has
been doing all along. As for the desire to deprive Hamas of their role,
it should be understood that the real role in the region is that which is
imposed by the people's will and struggle, not that which the U.S. Administration
grants or forbids! The real role is that which the free people extract through
their resistance of the occupation and their embodiment of their people's
ambitions and rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The role of Hamas is that which takes off from the free
will, and its credibility among its people is very strong and well established;
nobody can ignore it. On many occasions superpowers and empires gave in
to the peoples' will because the people are stronger with their rights.
Hamas is not worried about its role because no one on the earth can take
it away from them. But the U.S. Administration is that which suffers the
&quot;crisis of role&quot; and the crisis of the human and moral stand after
it is subjected to the influence and pressures of the Zionist powers and
to the will of the Zionist State, making the American positions and policies
those that serve that State.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, isn't it strange and ironic that the U.S. Administration
distributes the charges of terrorism and anti-peace over others on the same
days that witnessed the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American
atomic bombs?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli Army 'Major' Indicted for Murdering
English Tourist</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (23 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After initially seeking to pin the blame on Palestinians
for the murder of an English tourist in Elat last week, the Israeli authorities
have now admitted that Jeffrey Hunter was shot dead by a &quot;demented&quot;
Israeli holding the rank of Major in the Israeli Army.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday 22 August, an Israeli police spokesman said Daniel
Okev, 45, confessed to having killed Hunter and moderately wounding his
girl friend Charlotte Geib.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spokesperson said Okev, a Major in the Israeli Army,
didn't cite any motive for the crime, adding that &quot;I just did it on
the spur of the moment.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I don't know why I did it. I just pulled my gun and
shot them...may be I need to see a psychiatrist,&quot; the murderer was
quoted as saying as he was being remanded at a Be'ir al Sab'ba court Friday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Okev reportedly agreed to give the British couple a ride
from the southern Israeli town of Elat to Beir Sheba, but as the two Britons
stopped over for five minutes to smoke and have refreshment, the driver,
Okev, pulled his pistol and fired three bullets into Hunter's head, killing
him instantly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Okev, also fired at Geib, who was injured, before fleeing
back to Elat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, all Israeli police officials claimed that &quot;an
Arab driver from northern Israel was the chief suspect&quot; and that &quot;the
murder had nationalistic motivation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even Israeli Minister of Tourism, Moshe Katsav, made similar
remarks while visiting Geib who was recuperating from her wounds at an Israeli
hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Katsav was quoted as telling Gieb that &quot;Arab terrorism
was not only an Israeli problem and that the whole world ought to close
ranks against it.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli psychiatrists and psychologists often contend that
the Israeli army brutal repression of Palestinians during the Intifada left
deep psychological scars on many soldiers and field officers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Many of those soldiers have developed a trigger-happy
personality that is often coupled with a schizophrenic character whereby
they are given to easy shooting as they used to do in the streets of the
West Bank and Gaza,&quot; said an Israeli psychiatrist from the small town
of Omer near Beir al Sab'a.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, the Israeli Defense Ministry repeatedly
deployed army psychiatrists and psychologists to aide soldiers and officers
who developed psychosis as a result of killing Arab children.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians Hail &quot;National Unity Talks&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (20 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians from various political orientations have hailed
the &quot;National Unity Conference,&quot; held in Gaza on Wednesday, describing
it as &quot;our response to Israeli insolence and morbid efforts to fan
the flames of war amongst our people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;National unity should be a fixed Palestinian strategy
in the face of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu''s sinister efforts
to strangle our people and narrow our horizons,&quot; said Muhammed Khalid,
a prominent Hamas leader in the Jenin area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is clear that Netanyahu wants to see Palestinians
shed their own blood in order to appease his own cannibalistic instincts.
We must not allow him to realize his diabolic dream,&quot; added Khalid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jamal Shubaki, a Legislative Council member and refugee
from pre-1967 Palestine, concurred, saying &quot;that under any circumstances
should the Palestinian Authority give deference to Israeli demands to repress
a significant sector of our citizens.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Our strategy should be to cooperate with , rather
than fight, the Islamist camp. This policy shouldn't be a seasonal reaction
to Israeli insolence and oppression, but a principled strategy independent
of all other considerations,&quot; said Shubaki in a radio interview on
Wednesday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Gaza, the National Unity Conference was opened at the
Rashad al Shawwa Centre, under the chairmanship of Palestine Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas representative, Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, called on
Arafat &quot;to abandon the Oslo Agreement because it utterly failed to
restore our rights and dealt a painful blow to national unity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This agreement has forced us into a dark tunnel at
the end of which there is no glimmer of hope of flicker of light,&quot;
said Rantisi before a speechless Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Rantisi called on the PA to see to it that
human rights are respected and the authority of law and order be made to
prevail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, Sheikh Nafez Azzam of the Islamic Jihad organization,
reiterated his movement's implacable rejection of the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This agreement has given Israel all the assets and
us all the liabilities,&quot; said Azzam.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamist leader also called on the PA to boycott regional
economic conference scheduled to be held in Qatar in November. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Am labeled the conference &quot;the economic normalization
conference,&quot; exhorting the PA not to play the role of &quot;a normalization
middle-man between Israeli and the Arab world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Low Incentives</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>while Arafat is not expected to heed Hamas and Islamic
Jihad calls for &quot;terminating Oslo,&quot; he does seem to be trying
to reach a certain common ground with the Islamist camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, Arafat's costly refusal to succumb completely to
Israeli dictates is likely to be vindicated and could pay off in terms of
enhancing his position in the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the fact that Hamas decided, somewhat hastily and
without any reservations, to participate in the Gaza talks suggests that
the movement see a certain gratitude in Arafat's reluctance to clamp down
on its activists and infrastructure as incessantly demanded by the Israelis
and the Americans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Arafat is not being altruistic toward Hamas. The chairman
seems to realize that Netanyahu is after him as much as he is after Hamas,
and that he is interested in weakening him by making him fight Hamas on
behalf of Israel in return for nothing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In the past Arafat fought Hamas with a vigor because
he thought the peace process would pay off eventually. Now, the chairman
nearly lost this glimmer of hope, hence he has no incentives to fight Hamas,&quot;
said an &quot;insider&quot; close to the chairman.</FONT></P>

Palestinians</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- (19 August)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli justice ministry charged on Monday three Israeli
para-military border policemen with kidnapping and assaulting two Palestinians
earlier this month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An indictment released by the ministry said the policemen
took the two men to an isolated wood where they continually beat them, hitting
them on the head, chest and limbs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They were rounding up Palestinians who had entered Israel
without permits in the face of a closure imposed on the West Bank after
the July 30 suicide bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The indictment said the Israeli policemen tied the legs
of one of the men with a rope attached to their jeep and dragged him several
meters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The policemen continued to brutalise the other Arab &quot;even
after he began to beg to show him mercy because he suffered from heart troubles,&quot;
the charge sheet said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli television broadcast last week an interview
with the two Palestinians, Ahmad Mousa and Mahmoud Ghneim who lay side by
side in hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the interview, Mr. Mousa, breathing heavily through
a hospital mask, said &quot;each one of them carried a club and administered
beatings. One of them asked me if my chest was all right and hit me in the
chest. There were three who hit me.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;One of them pointed an M-16 rifle at my head- he
pointed the rifle next to my ear and told me, &quot;now you'll get out of
here. If I see you again, I will kill you. You must die.&quot;<BR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(13 August) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli soldiers reportedly raided several mosques in the
Hebron area on Monday night , desecrating the holy places and, in a clear
provocation, treading on copies of the Holy Quran.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources in Dura, 10 miles south west of Hebron,
said scores of Israeli soldiers raided the Grand Mosque in Dura at 2:30
a.m. Monday allegedly to &quot;look for inciteful materials&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The mosque muezzin, Subhi al Masalemh, said soldiers smashed
glass inside the mosque.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One soldier, he said, trod on copies of the Holy Quran
in his full view probably to test his reaction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Masalmeh said the soldiers desisted from the sacrilegious
act only when al Masalmeh complained to his superior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Israeli troops raided Masjid al Mujahed three
blocks away, smashing furniture and glass.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Afterwards, the soldiers raided the Al Anwar Athletic and
Cultural Club to carry out &quot;security searches.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Qazzaz, who supervise cultural activities at the
club, said &quot;the soldiers turned every thing upside down, but found
nothing that would incriminate us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They came looking for inciteful material and perhaps
more than that, but found bags and pencils for school children,&quot; Qazzaz
said, referring to a school paraphernalia sale at the club for low-income
families in the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, Israeli occupation troops
have raided as many as fifty Mosques throughout the West Bank since the
30 July double suicide bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At least twenty mosques were closed down for varying periods
of time and as many as fifty Imams were rounded up as an act of reprisal
against the Islamic movement which Israel blames for responsibility for
the bombing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources said that the number of Palestinians rounded
up since the bombing reached 300 half of were reportedly sent to detention
and concentration camps inside Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel treats Palestinian detainees as hostages and makes
their release conditional on receiving political concessions from Yasser
Arafat's political authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, Israel and the PA have not established the identity
of the perpetrators of the bombing.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat Resists Israeli Dictates</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (12 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is reportedly
resisting Israeli (and to a lesser degree) American dictates to carry out
massive arrests against Palestinian citizens associated with the Islamic
Movement, official Palestinian sources said on Tuesday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources said Arafat told the American peace envoy Dennis
Ross whom he met three times in the last two days that &quot;it is difficult
for me to start arresting people just because their names happen to be on
an Israeli list.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Acting at Israel's beck and call, Ross repeatedly urged
Arafat to &quot;fight terrorism and hit hard Hamas' social and educational
infrastructure.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Chairman Arafat, according to the sources, retorted,
saying that &quot;indiscriminate arrests proved counter-productive in the
past, and we are not going to do it this time just to appease the whims
of Mr. Netanyahu.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday night, Ross met with Arafat in Ramallah for more
than two hours during which he briefed him on his talks with Israeli leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the meeting, Ross told journalists that he had
achieved some progress &quot;mainly in the form of resuming security coordination&quot;
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Three &quot;security meetings&quot; did indeed take place
since Ross's arrival in Palestine on 9 August, during which Israeli and
Palestinian security and intelligence officials exchanged information on
&quot;terrorist elements,&quot; a reference to Islamic activists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA officials only spoke laconically about the meetings
in which officials from the CIA took part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Sha'ath, who assumes the planing portfolio in the
PA, recognized that it was &quot;disquieting that the security coordination
is resumed without addressing any of the political issues that brought about
the current crisis.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sha'ath apparently sought to give Ross the benefit of the
doubt, saying that his present mission was but a preparation for the upcoming
visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Madline Albright.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other Palestinian officials, however, dismissed Ross's
mission as a failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour said the visit didn't
achieve anything since it didn't deal with the causes of the current crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu vowed
not to enter into the final status talks &quot;until Arafat fights terrorism
with soul and heart.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli premier also said that security coordination
with the Palestinians was meaningless without the PA arresting Hamas supporters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ross is due to return to the United States on Wednesday
morning. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jews Attack Jews at Wailing Wall</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(12 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thousands of Haredi ultra orthodox Jews shouted obscenities
and threw stones and garbage at an estimated 200 conservative Jews who had
come to pray at al Burak Wall Monday night, eventually succeeding in evicting
them from the place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jews from both sects had gathered for &quot;a prayer of
lamentation,&quot; marking the destruction of the Jewish Temple by the Romans
around 70 A.D.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, the ultra-orthodox leadership
had warned the police that they would take the law into their own hands
if &quot;the heretics are not evicted immediately.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, the police reportedly had given the conservatives
a permission to pray at the site, but as the ultra-orthodox threatened to
turn violent, the police reneged on its promise to the conservatives and
evicted them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The commotion turned nasty when the police tried to force
the Conservative crowd out of the wailing wall plaza. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many people reportedly were thrown to the ground and trampled
on, as a group of Haredi youths shouted at the conservatives &quot;get out,
get out, you are desecrating the site.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli state-run radio &quot;call Yisrael&quot; reported
that the ultra-orthodox religious leadership was furious because the conservatives
held prayer sessions without men and women being segregated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the real reason seems to go much deeper, given
the Orthodox camp's enduring refusal to attach any Jewish religious legitimacy
to Judaism's two other main sects, the Conservative and Reform movements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli English daily, the Jerusalem Post, reported
an American Jew from Kansas City in the United States as saying that &quot;it
is repulsive that it should come down to attacks, Jew to Jew, especially
tonight.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israelis, save the Haredim, are generally embarrassed by
the recurrent friction between the predominant Orthodox leadership and the
followers of the other two sects which master a numerical majority especially
among American Jewry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, an American Rabbi from the Reform movement
told this journalist that &quot;Israeli apartheid is not only directed against
the Palestinians and non-Jews but also against Jews affiliated with Conservative
and Reform sects.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with the recurrent dilemma of having to reconcile
the seemingly impossible task of appeasing the powerful Orthodox leadership
and at the same time not alienating the bulk of American Jewry, the Israeli
government repeatedly sought to evade the issue of &quot;who is a Jew&quot;
by sticking to the religious status quo in Israel whereby the Orthodox maintains
their hegemony over the non-Orthodox.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In June, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to postpone
until November making a decision on whether the Israeli government should
or shouldn't recognize the Jewishness of Jews converted at the hands of
non-Orthodox rabbis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The issue seems to be very important to many in Israel
and abroad that some within the secular Israeli camp described it as &quot;a
time bomb.&quot;<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>President Arafat.. Please, show courage and
say NO</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (10 August)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Once again, the American peace envoy Dennis Ross arrived
in Palestine, ostensibly to try to revive the deadlocked peace process.
However, from his words in West Jerusalem on Sunday following his meeting
with the Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu, it is clear that the main,
and perhaps the sole, aim of the his present visit is to blackmail Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat into succumbing to Israeli dictates and
humiliating demands which would in effect turn him into a tool of repression
of his own people, and also enable Israel (at a certain time) to remark
gleefully that &quot;this is non of our business because Arabs are killing
Arabs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ross, an ardent Zionist who is utterly inadequate for the
role of honest mediator between Israel and the Palestinians (this is how
he has been repeatedly described by PA officials) admitted that the central
purpose of his visit was to resume full security and intelligence coordination
between Israel and PA security services, a euphemistic reference to fighting
Hamas and other Palestinian organizations still insisting on the recovery
of Palestinian rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, the gist of Ross's dubious mission to Palestine
is to push an increasingly weak and vulnerable Arafat to spark off the flames
of civil war among Palestinians, probably in emulation of the ill-reputed
Zionist Henry Kissenger who, it is widely believed, kindled the flames of
Lebanese civil war more than 20 years ago, causing an incalculable human
tragedy of immense proportions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is no secret that the eruption of inter-Palestinian
fighting has always been a dear Israeli desire, first by successive labor
governments and now by this racist, gang-like Netanyahu government. In fact,
Israeli officials even didn't seek to conceal their cannibalistic instincts
in this regard. When the head of the Israeli intelligence met secretly in
Rome with PA Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajub in 1994, the Israeli
official reportedly suggested to Rajub that he can have &quot; a carte blanche
in the West Bank and Gaza as long as you fight Hamas.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The remarks of the Israeli intelligence' head were neither
coincidental nor facetious. They represented the intrinsically morbid Israeli
mentality which thrives on bloodshed. To expedite their evil designs against
the Palestinian people, the Israeli actually made strenuous efforts and
spent great sums of money to implant the seeds of division and discord among
Palestinians. That was during the Intifada. And now, they are trying their
chances again, with venomous zeal and sinister determination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We all remember how the Israeli internal intelligence,
the Shabak, used to assassinate activists associated with Hamas and then
pin the blame on Fatah and vice versa in order to turn the Palestinians
against each other. Numerous other examples can be cited in this regard,
all attesting to the Zionists' virulent ideology and practices.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, it is reasonably satisfying that the Palestinian
community (indiscriminately and unceasingly tormented by a Satanic, evil
colonial occupation intent on ravaging their national identity and stealing
their homeland) has so far failed the diabolical Israeli expectations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And so we must continue, because inter-Palestinian fighting
could only be a macabre nightmare of infinite perils to Palestinian national
existence. This must be an axiomatic truism in the mind of every Palestinian
man, woman and child.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, the PA leadership is urged to resist Israeli and
American bullying at all costs because civil war would be the exact antithesis
of everything the Palestinians cherish. It, God forbid, would kill our hopes
for freedom and liberation for many decades to come and enable our callous
enemies to feel extremely gleeful and gloat at our incurred catastrophe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, Mr. Arafat, don't give in to our tormentors; your and
our enemy is not Hamas nor the Islamic Jihad, but those who implant colonies
at Abu Ghunaim, Ras al Amud, who are frantically obliterating the Arab-Islamic
identity of Jerusalem, and who are trying to do to us what White colonizers
did to the American Indians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Please, show courage and say NO.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Following is a memorandum distributed by the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) concerning the 30 July suicide bombing in West
Jerusalem. The memo was sent to the Arab foreign ministers, the Arab League,
and the various news agencies and newspapers.</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A Memorandum from the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas)</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>In Light of the Jerusalem Martyrdom Operation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the beginning of the colonial Zionist onslaught against
our land and people in Palestine, the Zionist invaders have pursued a policy
of terror and genocide. They have been driven by a pirate mentality that
recognises no law or moral value. So huge is the criminal record of the
Zionist invaders and so blood-stained is their history that many volumes
would be required to document both. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, since Benjamin Netanyahu's election, Zionist repressive
and oppressive measures against our people have been escalating. These have
included the killing of innocent Palestinians by both Israeli soldiers and
armed Jewish settlers, mass arrests and kidnapping of Palestinian citizens
as well as of elements of the Palestinian police force. They have also included
collective punishment of large segments of the Palestinian community, such
as the imposition of economic siege around entire villages and towns, the
repeated closures of such Arab-populated areas, to the extent that more
than 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been
held in a huge prison. Bulldozers have been mobilised to level confiscated
Palestinian land on top of which Jewish settlements are built to house newly
arriving invaders from places around the world as far away as Brooklyn in
New York. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So unjustly, and by means of the law of the jungle, the
true and legitimate owners of the land have been denied what belongs to
them. Our people are banished from the homes of their fathers and forefathers.
More than four million Palestinians continue to be scattered around the
world suffering the bitterness of exile and deprivation, while the land
is forcibly confiscated so as to house the invading gangsters and the extremist
Zionists who arrive in Palestine motivated by deep rooted feelings of despise
and malice and who justify on the bases of fake promises the killing of
Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zionist attacks against holy shrines in Jerusalem, Hebron
and Bethlehem have been on the rise. The characters of the noble prophet
of Islam Muhammad peace be upon him and the virgin Mary peace be upon her
have been blasphemed against and the holy Quran has been desecrated out
of malice and hatred. More than one billion Muslims have been insulted by
such desecration, and both Muslims and Christians around the world have
been abhorred by these Zionist racist actions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What option has our Ummah been left with? The life of a
people whose land, religion, shrines, honour and dignity are undermined
in this manner has no value. While denying our people their rights and as
they enjoy seeing Palestinians suffer and agonise, the Zionists do what
they want and usurp what they like. The Zionists want to keep the land and
monopolise its resources while at the same time demanding security and peace.
They expect the Palestinian Authority (PNA) to keep the peace for them and
to fight its own people on their behalf. They ask Syria to provide them
with peace and to engage in normalising relations with their Zionist entity,
while at the same time they insist on annexing the Golan Heights and on
keeping it. In the meantime, they continue their adventures in South Lebanon.
The Zionists want the world to provide them with security, to mourn their
dead and to express sorrow and admit guilt for what they allege to have
suffered. At the same time they want to maintain the upper hand and enjoy
an absolute freedom to kill, destroy and corrupt. As far as they are concerned,
other peoples have no sanctity, no humanity and no rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Divine and man-made laws and international conventions
confirm the right of every community that suffers aggression or comes under
invasion to defend itself and to struggle with all the means available to
it until it is fully liberated, materially and morally, from the oppressors
who seize its resources and undermine its freedom. Divine and earthly laws
alike legitimate the struggle against aggression, and recognise the right
of the wronged to exert all he can in order to thwart aggression and deter
the aggressor. The Palestinian people cannot, and should not, be denied
such a right merely because the Zionist project is supported by some major
world powers. Palestine is an Arab Islamic territory that has been occupied
by invading gangs that came from distant parts of the world relying on and
enjoying the unconditional support of the colonial powers whose interests
at this given moment in history happen to be identical with those of the
Zionist movement. It was possible for the Zionist dream to materialise at
a time when the Arabs and Muslims were in the weakest of their moments as
they completely succumbed to the sweeping colonial campaign earlier this
century. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although the duty of confronting this colonial project
is to be shouldered by all the Arabs and Muslims, and while the World Community
bears responsibility for the injustice suffered by he Palestinian people,
our people, who hold fast to their lands and rights, and who are determined
to stand up to the inhumane Zionist practices and provocative actions of
the Zionist enemy that occupies our land, have the sole option of doing
whatever they can to defend themselves and avenge their religion and dignity.
By doing so, our people hope to motivate the entire Ummah to shoulder its
responsibility, to deter those who might contemplate undermining the sanctity
of the Ummah and to thwart the Zionist threat that is endangering the existence
and culture of the Arab and Islamic Ummah. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The entire world has witnessed the insolence of the extremist
Jews who blasphemed against Prophet Muhammad and the Virgin Mary. Television
screens around the globe showed the Zionists desecrating the Holy Quran
at Al-Ya'qubiyah school in Hebron out of malice and hatred. Believers worldwide
were dismayed by such actions and huge demonstrations were organised in
various parts of the Muslim World to protest against the blasphemous acts,
to demand retribution and to denounce the indifference shown by governments
regionally and internationally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>International human rights organisations have documented
over the past few years massive violations of human rights perpetrated by
Israeli troops and secret service agents. The Israeli government's policy
of confiscating Arab land to build more housing complexes for Jewish settlers
is an example of the daily violations of basic Palestinian human rights.
Once again, and in striking disregard for world public opinion, the Israeli
government is laying the foundations for a new settlement project at Bab
Al-'Amud in East Jerusalem similar to the settlement project of Jabal Abu
Ghunaim. Such projects are clearly aimed at evacuating Jerusalem completely
from its Arab inhabitants and encircling it with a security belt. Not a
single hilltop in the entire West Bank has been spared. They have all almost
completely been transformed into Jewish settlements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meantime no less than five thousand Palestinian
prisoners lavish in extremely harsh conditions in Israeli detention camps.
They suffer deprivation, persecution and savage torture. Several Palestinians
have so far lost their lives while in detention. Families of the detainees
continue to agonise and suffer deprivation, poverty and depression. The
so-called peace process has failed to deliver the promises of economic prosperity
as much as it has failed to secure the release of thousands of Palestinian
prisoners. In spite of all the rhetoric, the entire Palestinian population
is frequently subjected to collective punishment for a variety of reasons.
The Zionist entity continues to be in charge of every minor or major affair
of the Arab population in spite of allegedly having turned such matters
to the PNA in accordance with the peace accords between the two sides. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The provocative practices of the Zionist enemy have left
our people with no option but to escalate their legitimate resistance against
occupation using the language that is alone comprehensible to the enemy,
namely the language of force. This is especially compelling in view of the
fact that the promises of the illusory peace have proven to be false. The
peace accords signed with the enemy have led neither to restoring the rights
of Palestinians nor to putting an end to the overt and massive violations
of human rights, nor to an end to the desecration of holy shrines. Instead,
this peace has empowered the enemy to tighten its grip around our people.
It goes without saying, however, that in spite of the feebleness of this
peace, the resistance of our people has not been directed against it but
at self-defence and at avenging our victims and shrines. Such resistance
is perfectly legitimate; it would not have been met with outrage had it
been undertaken by other peoples around the globe. It is of the type that
was indeed pursued by many nations in Europe and America, and it is identical
with the legitimate struggle waged against Apartheid by the people of South
Africa. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The allegation that the martyrdom operations are aimed
at derailing the peace process is baseless. The peace process has been stalled
since Netanyahu came to power, and has been facing fatal obstacles throughout
the Rabin-Peres era. A settlement that is kept alive on a ventilator by
its sponsors who have no consideration for the plight of our people is not
worth being derailed or thwarted; it is already dead. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for the recent American initiative, it is not much different
from preceding initiatives that were based on a temporary pain-killing policy
while in reality only what the enemy wanted is given priority and the Palestinian
partner is always forced to succumb to the status quo created by the occupation.
Why then is all this mourning of the American initiative? Is it conceivable
to expect the so-called American mediator to play any real role in favour
of just peace when this same mediator twice blocked a Security Council condemnation
of the Israeli settlement project at Abu Ghunaim?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The martyrdom operations carried out by the heroes of our
people, who have dedicated themselves to defending their land, rights and
shrines, constitute a sound means to force the racist Zionist regime to
stop its settlement programme and to deter extremist Jewish settlers who
escalate their attacks against unarmed Palestinian civilians. These Jihad
operations are the hope of our people and the only option available to them
to force the Israelis into releasing our Palestinian people's detainees.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Casualties among civilians in wars are common and are usually
justified. It would only be expected that such casualties are not out of
the ordinary in a liberation war such as ours. The Jihadi operations of
our people are legitimate self-defence and resistance that target Zionist
occupation troops. However, the insistence of the enemy's troops and settlers
on killing our civilians, including men, women and elderly, and the rejection
by the occupation authorities of the offer made by Hamas to refrain from
killing civilians, have left our people with no option but to respond in
accordance with the rule &quot;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot;.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So long as the Zionist enemy does not distinguish in dealing
with our people between armed elements and civilians, and so long as enemy
troops, security officers, secret agents and settlers continue to liquidate
and kill in cold blood the struggling children of our people, the leadership
of the enemy alone bears the consequences. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We, at the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), call upon
all official and popular Palestinian, Arab and Islamic circles, and upon
all freedom-loving persons in the world to rise in support of our people
to help them in their endeavour to rid themselves of occupation and to stop
the aggression against our land, people and shrines. We also call upon all
the Arab and Islamic governments to adopt a genuine, serious and comprehensive
programme to confront the Zionist threat, and to restore Arab unity and
formulate a strategy for a pan-Arab renaissance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We also call upon the countries of the world to recognise
the plight of our people who are suffering murder, banishment, detention
and desperate living conditions, and to move seriously in the direction
of pressuring the Zionist government to stop its aggressive policies against
our Palestinian people and deal with the real causes of the problem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We, at Hamas, are confident that our people, with the help
of Allah, will achieve victory, liberate the land and the holy shrines and
defeat the occupiers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our cause is just and we have the right to struggle for
justice. We shall march forward and continue our legitimate resistance.
Aggression will not last long and the occupation will not persist. Furthermore,
we are not alone in the field. Our people are behind us, and so is our Ummah
and all freedom-lovers in the world. Allah almighty is with us too.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (7 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Like gangsters, terrorists and common criminals do, the
Israeli occupation authorities have rounded up more than 500 Palestinians
in an apparent retaliation for the 30 July double suicidal bombing in West
Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources pointed out that since the bombing,
Israeli soldiers, border police and Special undercover units have been carrying
out nightly raids on Mosques and homes throughout the West Bank, often desecrating
holy books, including the Quran, and arresting people with Islamist orientation.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Virtually all the detainees are effectively treated as
&quot;hostages&quot; as their detention and continued incarceration for
long periods of time are done completely outside the confines of the law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights organizations, including B'tselem and al Haq,
pointed out that the hostages are incarcerated in large detention camps
for as long as it expedient for the Israeli government's policies and interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They (the Israelis) detain those people for many
months, even years, without telling them why they are being detained...Their
detention may well be compared with the detention of Japanese in the United
States during WWII,&quot; said Mazen Dandis, a B'tselem activist working
in Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dandis added that the rounding up of people was the &quot;occupier's
tool&quot; of &quot;punishing and tormenting the occupied.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Virtually all the detainees are innocent since the
Israelis themselves don't charge them with any wrong-doing nor, of course,
try them before court.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to B'tselem, as many as 700 Palestinians are
held as &quot;hostages&quot; (many in solitary confinement) in three detention
camps in Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights organizations, local and foreign, repeatedly
wrote to the Israeli Defence Minister to &quot;either try those people or
set them free,&quot; however, to no avail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, an Israeli Labour Party Knesset member, Dalya
Itsek, revealed that Israeli prison authorities &quot;routinely carry out
scientific and medical experiments on Palestinian detainees without their
knowledge.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Itsek also disclosed that &quot;several Israeli drug-manufacturing
firms are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of their products
on humans.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Humiliation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The manner in which the detention of Palestinians is interesting.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians point out that Israeli soldiers often raid
Palestinian homes at the quiet hours before dawn, pounding doors, and terrorizing
the entire family.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, to further terrorize a given family, the heavily
armed soldiers would often beat up the family's adult male members, particularly
the father, in the full view of his wife and children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Needless to say, observers have always believed that Israeli
mistreatment of Palestinians was instrumental in the suicidal bomber phenomenon
among Palestinians.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>TOTAL CLOSURE</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT ( 5 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In retaliation for the 30 July suicide bombing in West
Jerusalem, the Israeli government imposed a &quot;total closure&quot; on
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, cutting off Arab towns and villages individually
from each other and collectively from the outside world. Consequently, many
vital supplies and services, including those usually taken for granted,
were stopped due to IDF blockades of Palestinian population centers. In
several instances, patients died and women had to give birth at military
roadblocks, having been denied access to nearby hospitals. Moreover, the
collective &quot;town-arrest&quot; seems to have had inflicted incalculable
damage to the originally fragile Palestinian economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority sources described the draconian Israeli
measures as &quot;unprecedented in harshness&quot; and &quot;aimed at subjugating
and humiliating our people.&quot; PA Chairman Yasser Arafat termed the Israeli
reprisals as a &quot;criminal act of genocidal proportions&quot; and amounting
to a &quot;declaration of war,&quot; a description repeatedly echoed by
his aides and ministers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking during a press conference in Gaza on 4 August,
the Palestinian leader accused Israel of &quot;tightening the noose on the
Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people instead of fighting terrorism.&quot;
Arafat's desperate words did carry an air of veracity. The Israeli measures,
probably the harshest ever, virtually paralyzed the PA as it forced Palestinian
officials &quot;to hibernate, each in his immediate place of residence,&quot;
as one official put it. For some officials, the &quot;claustrophobia&quot;
was so acute, that media celebrities such as Nabil Sha'ath publicly complained
on the air to a Voice of Israel reporter &quot;to help me if you can because
I'm stranded in Gaza due to the closure.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hafez al Barghouthi, Editor-in-Chief of the pro-PA daily,
al Hayatul Jadida, marveled at the effects of the Israeli measures in preventing
terrorism.&quot; &quot;I don't understand anymore, He sarcastically wrote
in his daily column on 5 August, &quot;how the dumping of a truck-load of
earth at village entrances would prevent a would be terrorist from proceeding
to his ultimate destination.&quot; &quot;Nor how barring newspapers from
reaching Gaza would contribute to fighting terror...unless one takes into
account the plausible possibility that a terrorist could very well fold
himself in paper form or be resurrected from one of the obituaries.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ostensibly, the collective punishment is meant to induce
the PA to crack down on Hamas on behalf of Israel, and also to &quot;further
narrow Palestinians' horizons&quot; in the hope that they would come to
terms with the Israeli &quot;fait accompli.&quot; However, it is seemingly
unlikely that the Israeli policy would achieve the desired goal on both
levels. The PA, which has never been weaker among Palestinians, is not in
a position to openly and unashamedly act at Benjamin Netanyahu's beck and
call as this would quicken its demise in the eyes of the Palestinians and
decisively vindicate the often-voiced charges that it is merely an Israeli
puppet militia aimed at tormenting the Palestinians and ravaging their collective
psychological immunity vis-&brvbar;-vis Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, a wholesale crackdown on Hamas and the Islamic Jihad
under Israel's incessant dictates would conceivably strengthen the Islamists
in Palestinian opinion. It could also corrode the already frail political
constituencies on which Arafat has based his leadership and orchestrated
his support for the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, this seems to explain why the PA has not yet embarked
on &quot;an all-out campaign of mass arrests&quot; of Islamist elements
as was done following the spate of suicide bomb attacks in Israel in the
spring of 1996. But there are other important reasons militating against
a decision to that effect. The PA has come to feel that Hamas is no longer
the sole sought-after enemy by Israel and that Fatah, the PA itself and,
indeed, the &quot;collective Palestinian interest&quot; would eventually
be , more-or-less, ultimate targets for Israeli insolence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This view was recently echoed by Abbas Zaki, a prominent
Fatah leader and member of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Speaking
in Hebron last week (before the suicidal bombing), Zaki said Hamas was no
longer the only bad guys in the sight of Israel, adding that &quot;every
patriotic Palestinian acting on his patriotism is now viewed as terrorist
by Israel.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zaki's remarks were vindicated a day later when the &quot;&quot;&quot;Israeli
army issued a warrant to arrest Arafat's top police officer Brig. Gen. Ghazi
al Jabali on terrorism-related charges. Needless to say, the arrest warrant
against al Jabali, who had led the crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad
last year, served as an &quot;eye-opener&quot; for many PA officials and
ordinary Palestinians, who had previously been told that &quot;Hamas was
the enemy).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zaki's views, however, don't seem to reflect &quot;Yaser
Arafat's thinking and that of his deputy, Mahmud Abbas. Arafat reportedly
expressed willingness to &quot;resume full security and intelligence coordination&quot;
with Israel. For his part, Abbas, whose increasingly focal obsequiousness
vis-&brvbar;-vis Israel has come to be viewed with growing repugnance and
simmering discontent, said the West Jerusalem suicidal bombing necessitated
the immediate resumption of the security coordination with Israel. However,
it seems that Arafat's and Abbas's reconciliatory approach toward Israel
won't do the Palestinians any good in the long run. The reason largely stems
form the reasonably sound premise that &quot;Palestinian terrorism is not
the main factor behind Israeli intransigence, and that Israel accentuates
this factor purely for political and propagandistic reason,&quot; a premise
the Palestinian leadership has not really understood, much less acted on.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>IS IT TOO LATE FOR PEACE?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most ordinary Palestinians reacted to the latest suicidal
bombing with stark ambivalence. However, this time it seems that their &quot;indignation
at Netanyahu&quot; and &quot;disenchantment with Arafat&quot; markedly overweighed
their innate reservations and objections to wanton killing. Indeed, a sizable
majority of Palestinians seemed to squarely blame the Israeli government
for &quot;pushing Palestinians to the brink of despair.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This man (Netanyahu) is offering us either of two
choices, surrender or terrorism,&quot; said one PA minister from the Hebron
area, adding that &quot;many more people would ultimately become potential
and actual suicidal bombers if the Israeli government continued its current
policies in the West Bank.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The minister's pessimism will likely gain added significance
in light of continued mutual violence. On 4 August, and Israeli settler
murdered an elderly Palestinian shepherd outside the village of Yatta, 15
miles south of Hebron, apparently in retaliation for the West Jerusalem
bombing. Interestingly, members of the bereaved family reportedly shouted
&quot;death to the Jews&quot; and &quot;Ayyash, Ayyash,&quot; a reference
to Hamas master bomber who Israel says stood behind the wave of suicidal
bomb attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem last year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More significantly, however, is the fact that an increasing
number of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims, have come to believe that it
is already late to reach an equitable, lasting settlement between Israel
and the Palestinians in light of the facts in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Unfortunately, this view, however gloomy it may be, is being vindicated.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel Reconsiders Decision to Jam PA Radio
Station</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (3 August) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government has apparently reconsidered an earlier
decision to jam the &quot;Voice of Palestine, &quot; a Ramallah-based radio
station representing the official views of the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not clear what prompted the Israeli government to
decide to keep the &quot;Voice of Palestine&quot; on air, but informed Israeli
sources in West Jerusalem dismissed official Israeli claims that &quot;technical
difficulties&quot; was the reason as &quot;nonsense.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is relatively easy to jam the Ramalla radio station
(the Voice of Palestine); Israel has been jamming for sometime another Palestinian
radio station, the Damascus-based 'this is Jerusalem' run by Ahmed Jebril,&quot;
said the sources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources opined that the real reason had to do with
intelligence assessment that jamming the Voice of Palestine would weaken
PA chairman Yasser Arafat, which eventually would not serve Israeli interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, Knesset member and former deputy-head of Shabak,,
Gedeon Ezra, reportedly advised the Israeli government not to go ahead with
plans to jam the Palestinian radio station.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli decision was lauded by Palestinian officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Radwan Abu Ayyash, Head of the Palestinian Broadcasting
Authority, described it as &quot; a step in the right direction.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Ayyash, however, sounded defiant, saying during a radio
interview with the Voice of Palestine that the Palestinian Authority would
have sought alternative channels of information had the Israeli government
put its original decision to jam the VOP into effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, the Israeli army continued to round
up suspected Islamist activists in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources close to the Islamists estimated that
as many as 150 activists had been arrested since 31 July, the day after
the suicidal bombing in Jerusalem took place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mahmud Sha'alan, an Islamist leader from the Nablus area
described the latest spate of arrest as &quot;random, politically-motivated,
and aimed at appeasing the Israeli public.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;When they arrest hundreds of people and keep them
behind bars as hostages, without charge or trial, it means that they have
scored an intelligence fiasco,&quot; said Sha'alan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu gave
Israeli troops the green light to operate freely within area (B) which is
nominally under civilian PA control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The measure is not likely to make a big difference since
the Israeli army never ceased operating within area (B) and, especially
recently, area (A) which is supposed to be under exclusive PA control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, PA police, too, have been making arrests
among Palestinian Islamists, mainly under virtual Israeli duress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, it is noted that the PA hesitates to carry out
an all-out effort to heed incessant Israeli calls to that effect for fear
of losing face among ordinary Palestinians.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas denies relationship with New York suspects,
saying Lafi was recruited by the Israeli Shabak</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- Special for PT (2 August)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A responsible source of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) has castigated what it called American and Zionist attempt to disfigure
Hamas' image and to cripple its resistance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A press release issued by Hamas today said that the American
and Zionist attempt to distort Hamas' struggle and its stands has become
evident. It added that by this attempt, the American administration and
the Zionist state tried to link between Hamas and the persons who were arrested
in New York recently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It was discovered that one of the suspects in this
case, who is called Khalil Lafi, is an agent for the Israeli Internal Security
Service (Shabak). People from his village , Ajjoul, near Ramallah of the
West Bank confirmed that Khalil Lafi was recruited by the Shabak after he
was arrested in 1993 on charge of entering (Israel) without permission.
They added that he served among the Palestinian detainees in the Israeli
jails as &quot;informer&quot; to the Shabak,&quot; Hamas said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas' statement pointed out, according to the people of
the village, that the Palestinian detainees discovered his real character
and interrogated him. He admitted to them that he deluded several Palestinian
girls and recruited them in the Shabak and that he was driven out of his
village several years ago because of his immoral conduct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>People of the village also said they were surprised when
they learned the way Khalil Lafi left the Occupied Territories and arrived
in the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These information clearly disclose the reality about
the current developments which are seen as a blatant attempt to mislead
the public opinion and to harm Hamas and distort its Jihad and legitimate
resistance,&quot; Hamas argued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Hamas, which denied any relationship with the New
York prisoners, expresses its sorrow because some agencies of the U.S. Administration
try to disfigure its picture and to fabricate charges in coordination with
the Zionist Occupation authorities,&quot; Hamas' statement concluded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, a communiqu&eacute; issued by Hamas condemned
the U.S. Administration's allegations of a proposed relationship between
the Islamic movement and the Arab suspects held by the New York authorities
few days ago. Following is the full text of the communiqu&eacute;:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>About the American allegations of the proposed relationship
between the New York detainees and Hamas Movement</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Our Mujahideen's weapons do not target anyone
but the Occupation</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Attempts to distort our Jihad is a continuous
Zionist conspiracy</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a queer and unwise step, a spokesman of the New York
Police said the police investigators suspect some relationship between the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and detainees the U.S. authorities claim
planned to attack Jewish targets in the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While we condemn this precipitate announcement considering
it a blatant attempt that aims to offend efforts of our people's Jihad and
our movement and to destroy our legitimate objectives and the heroic acts
of our Mujahideen on Palestinian lands as well as to divert attention away
from what is happening in Palestine, we deny any relationship between us
and those who were detained or to charges against them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas declared repeatedly that its Jihad does not target
anyone except the Zionist Occupation and that the Blessed land of Palestine
is the arena of its Jihad. It also stressed that it would remain loyal to
its objectives of liberating Palestine and it would never divert away from
this legitimate objective. Hamas clearly declared it would not be involved
in outside battles which serve only the Zionist Occupation and its plans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While we remind the whole world of our declared stand which
rejects any attacks outside Occupied Palestine, we do not dismiss the fact
that some Zionist services and U.S. services who colluded with them are
involved in an attempt to place the blame on Hamas and to give the followers
of the Zionists in the United States a pretext to harass the Arab and Muslim
institutions and communities working in the U.S. which have shown a commitment
to their Nation's questions and proven an increasing influence in clarifying
the reality of the struggle to the American public opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas, which condemns the U.S. Administration's bias towards
the Zionist enemy in its struggle against the Nation, stresses again that
it does not act hostilely towards the American People nor does it target
any of its categories or sects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We in Hamas are closely following up the developments of
this case, and reaffirm to everybody that the attempt to expand the circle
of the struggle against Hamas or to force its name into alleged plots and
accusations, is an unwise act that does not benefit anyone. It serves the
objectives of the Zionist enemy which has every hope to see the Palestinian
weapons preoccupied and to make the Resistance busy with battles that are
far removed from it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. Administration and its agencies should verify
the accuracy of the information before making false charges against the
Palestinian People and the Mujahideen forces.</FONT></P>
