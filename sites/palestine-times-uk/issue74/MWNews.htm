for killing Israelis</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman - PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Jordanian military court on 19 July sentenced Ahmad Dakamseh
to life imprisonment with hard labour on the charge of killing seven Israeli
girls who were shot down on 13 March while visiting Baqoura, a tourist spot
north of Jordan on the border. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The court found Dakamseh, a 26-year-old soldier, not guilty
of premeditated murder but he was convicted of committing intentional murder.
The court also ordered to demote his rank of corporal to private and to
discharge him from the military service. Dakamseh, who was serving at a
border post near Baqoura, was insulted by the Israeli teenaged girls while
he was performing prayers. When he finished, he took up his gun and began
shooting in the direction of the girls. Medical reports showed that he was
mentally disturbed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A statement was issued by the defence lawyer expressing
his shock over the verdict. He said that he expected the sentence to be
eased because the murder was not a premeditated crime and that his client
was not aware of what he was doing. He also said that the girls were students
at a higher Jewish religious school and they mocked the Jordanian soldier
as he prayed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The former Prime Minister Ahmad Obeidat, who was also a
member of Dakamseh's defence team, expressed his dissatisfaction with the
sentence saying he expected it to be between 10 and 15 years because the
crime was not premeditated. &quot;In the case of a crime affecting more
than one victim, life imprisonment is the usual sentence, but the court
applied this without taking into consideration the mental state of the accused,&quot;
he said. Dakamseh escaped the death penalty when the court ruled that the
murder of the girls visiting the border tourist spot known as &quot;peace
island&quot; on 13 March was not premeditated or politically motivated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The court said his shooting spree could be explained by
&quot;personality disorders,&quot; &quot;extreme fatigue after a 22-hour
guard shift,&quot; and &quot;sexual frustration, because his wife had recently
given birth.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Described as the most serious decision
in its history,</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood decides to boycott
elections</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman - Special for PT </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A leading Islamic group in Jordan decided to boycott the
parliamentary elections scheduled to be held next November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood, the main
Islamic and Opposition stream in Jordan, attributed its decision, which
was described by analysts and observers as the most serious political decision
in the MB's 50-year history, to a number of accumulated abuses of human
rights and public freedoms as well as to the arbitrary decisions made by
the successive governments which caused the democratic process in the country
to deteriorate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The MB participated in the 1993 elections despite
the dissolution of parliament before the end of its legal mandate and the
issuance of the temporary law of &quot;One Man One Vote&quot; in 1993 which,
according to many local, Arab and international leaders of the public opinion
and public work, aimed to diminish and contain the Islamic Movement. This
law has torn the social fabric and paralysed the popular political forces
from developing the political and social life of Jordan. It has also aborted
the possibility of any real exchange of power or influence on the political
and legislative decisions,&quot; the statement said, adding that the law
led to the coming of a parliament that did not represent the people's conscience
or the different social categories. &quot;It was a parliament run by the
government and through which it succeeded to pass all legislations, laws
and decisions the government wanted,&quot; the statement argued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Explaining why the Muslim Brotherhood did not boycott the
1993 elections although they were held under the same law and political
circumstances, it pointed out that this was to give the government a chance
to reconsider its policies. &quot;If the MB refrained from taking the same
decision in previous important political occasions, this was for the purpose
of giving a chance for reform and with the hope to activate its role in
parliament as well as to fulfill important achievements to confront the
reconciliation agreements with the Israelis and their consequences. The
MB was also hoping to stop the deterioration of democracy. However, the
accumulated events and pressures continued because of the progressive regression
in various areas which obliged the Movement to stop and reconsider the situation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Commenting on the situation of the public freedoms and
human rights in Jordan, the Muslim Brotherhood noticed that it was deteriorating.
&quot;There was a marked increase in arbitrary and unjustified arrests,
especially those members of the MB and those who sympathized with the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas). Some of those political prisoners were subject
to different types of unprecedented physical and psychological torture in
this country. A large number of citizens were arrested following the increase
of bread prices and many others were pursued on charges of slander and received
severe sentences. The government prevented the majority of the peaceful
activities of the parties in which they wanted to express their stands.
The Opposition parties were dealt with as if they were illegal parties.
Several measures taken by the government made these parties live in fear
and obsession over an expected collapse of democracy,&quot; the statement
pointed out. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Movement attacked the Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty saying it endangers Jordan's existence, identity, sovereignty, independence
and power. &quot;The treaty also confirms the falsity of the promises of
the so-called peace. The citizens are now rejecting it more than any time
before. They also understand its dangers and fear the future more than any
other time,&quot; the statement added. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Muslim Brotherhood are aware of the critical
state of the local, regional and international politics and understand their
responsibility towards the country and the nation's causes, especially at
this crucial stage, and they believe that their decision of boycotting the
1997 parliamentary elections is necessary to establish democracy and protect
the homeland just as their decision to participate in the previous elections
was to achieve the same goal.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the MB specified a number of points it said would
rectify the present situation:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Making constitutional reforms that establish the separation
between authorities and give the legislative authority its full right and
role in legislation, supervision and accountability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Cancelling the &quot;One Man One Vote&quot; law and
replacing it with a civilized law that can achieve impartiality and justice
in order to allow the citizens to elect the deputies who represent them
honestly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3. Cancelling the temporary press law in order to maintain
the freedom of expression and the democracy of the press and media.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>4. Ceasing all arbitrary measures against the parties and
other establishments of the civil society and allowing the activities of
the peaceful Opposition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>5. Treating the different economic situations through serious
action by resisting all forms and instruments of corruption and rejecting
the implementation of dictation by the International Monetary Fund and the
policies of the New World Order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>6. Releasing freedoms and ceasing the abuse and violations
against these freedoms in a way that fosters the popular partnership in
decision-making and in forging the trends that affect the present and future
of the people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>7. Ceasing the normalization of relations with the Zionist
State and closing the door to prevent its penetration into our society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Muslim Brotherhood has 15 members in the present Jordanian
Lower House of Parliament who won the 1993 elections under the Islamic Action
Front (IAF) compared to 23 deputies in 1989. The Muslim Brotherhood established
the IAF in 1993 following the issuance of the parties law to be its political
party although it attracted a number of Islamists other than the members
of the MB.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile (at the time of writing this report), four Jordanian
opposition parties decided to follow the MB in boycotting the 1997 parliamentary
elections. The professional associations had also decided to follow suit.
Mr. Emad Abu Diyya, a member of the MB's executive committee, predicted
that the other opposition parties will follow. &quot;The people are fed
up; they are tired. The economic and political situation is making everyday
life harder and harder for the average citizen,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>The strategic goals of the U.S. assistance
to Egypt</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Abdel Karim Hammoudeh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S.-Egyptian relations have been strongly shaken recently
after a recommendation made last June by the foreign operations subcommittee
of the congressional appropriations committee deleting Egypt from the list
of the foreign countries that receive American military and financial assistance.
Egypt was due to receive $2.1 billion of this assistance during 1998. Moreover,
the committee's chairman Senator Mitch McConnell declared a decision to
deduct $205 million from the assistance allocated to Egypt and pay the amount
to Jordan instead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The timing of the U.S. committee's decision carried political
implications because it came at a time when the peace process stalled in
the Middle East. It also came amidst American and Israeli accusations against
Egypt that it was encouraging the Palestinians and the other Arab parties
to face the Israeli obstinacy. Although, the decisions and recommendations
made by the congressional committee are not binding to the Congress or to
the U.S. Administration, the committee's decision had a symbolic significance.
Observers say that if the U.S. Administration wanted to achieve certain
objectives from the assistance to Egypt, the hinting to cease it could be
a kind of pressure which eventually serves Israel's interests. According
to American and Arab diplomatic sources, no country is eligible for the
U.S. assistance nor should it consider this assistance an unquestionable
right. The continuation of this assistance depends on the response of that
country to Washington's desires and interests. The congressional committee
justified its decision concerning the assistance to Egypt because of Egypt's
efforts to guard and protect Libya which, according to the committee, made
Cairo a state that defends terrorism. It &quot;accused&quot; Egypt of building
close relations with Libya, refusing to attend the Middle East summit which
President Clinton was invited to for last September, suspending the multilateral
peace talks, impeding talks between the PLO and the Israeli government over
Hebron, and leading efforts to revive the boycott of Arab commercial relations
with Israel.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>U.S. assistance to Egypt</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. Administration began rendering assistance to Egypt
in 1975 after the restoration of the relations between the two countries.
That year, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
opened an office in Cairo to give assistance to Egypt. In 1978, following
the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel, the financial
assistance was sharply increased and covered different aspects of economic
activities, infrastructure and birth control projects, environment protection
programmes, and the encouragement of developing democracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A report issued by the U.S. Congress revealed that Egypt
has received total assistance of $18.8 billion from the United States between
1975 and 1994, of which $15 billion were donations and $3.8 billion were
easy loans. Sources pointed out that the $2.1 billion of American assistance
to Egypt is divided into $1.3 billion in military assistance and $800 million
for development programmes. An American researcher pointed out that Egypt's
military purchases from the United States during the last 20 years have
achieved a number of benefits to the U.S. industry:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A total of $8.261 billion as profits and wages of workers
in the American military industry besides offering about 136,600 jobs every
year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A direct impact on production and investment which were
estimated at $7.9 billion which in turn offered 102,000 job opportunities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Local and federal taxes and charges estimated at $4.098
billion.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Egypt's Position</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many Egyptian economists stress that the importance of
the U.S. assistance to Egypt is weakening because of inflation and the rates
of economic growth in Egypt. They add that the U.S. assistance now forms
only 3% of Egypt's national income which reached 268 billion Egyptian pounds
(about $75 billion) in the annual budget 1997/98 while it formed 12% in
the 1979 budget. The economists pointed out that most of the assistance
is spent on American commodities that are not needed by Egypt and on high
payments and wages for American consultants. Therefore, the ceasing of the
assistance will not have a negative impact on the Egyptian economy. They
added that 70% of U.S. assistance goes back to the U.S. treasury.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Egyptian government began considering measures to face
all possibilities and consequences of a future U.S. decision to cease the
assistance. A committee was set up for this purpose which recommended a
reduction in the government subsidization of commodities and services, the
government expenditures, and the allocations for activities that use the
U.S. assistance funds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although the congressional appropriations committee, headed
by Senator Ted Stevens, refused the recommendation by the foreign operations
subcommittee and hence kept Egypt on the list of foreign aids for 1998 with
the same level of assistance ($2.116 billion), the crisis caused by the
subcommittee's recommendation had many reactions inside Egypt. It is a precedent
that could be repeated in future to pressure and blackmail Egypt politically
and economically. These pressures are not exerted to serve the U.S. interests
but to appease the Zionist Lobby in Washington.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Turkey on Erbakan's road... in spite of
Attaturk</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Nabil Chbib</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Turkey today is different than what it was before the coming
to power of Necmettin Erbakan and his Rafah Party a year ago. The assessment
of Erbakan's supporters could be different than that of his rivals regarding
the 11 months he spent in power. But they have no way to differ over or
deny the following political facts:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- The secularists in and out of Turkey were accusing the
Islamists of making use of the democratic 'game' in order to come into power
and then got rid of the other parties. This was not the case. Rafah was
the only party that defended democracy while the other parties ran in the
opposite direction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Islamists were also accused of not being able to run
a modern state and of taking the country back to the 'European' Middle Ages.
But the last 12 months were the only period in the history of modern Turkey
in which its economy flourished. Many significant achievements were made
during that period, such as solving the problem of electrical power needs
through agreements with neighbouring countries, breaking the monopoly of
the Western arms factories by the establishment of joint factories with
Islamic nations, and increasing the share prices in the Turkish main stock
exchange in Istanbul, which doubled compared with its prices on the first
day Mr. Erbakan took power.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- All decisions made by the army leaders regarding the
dismissal of the Islamist soldiers and even the foreign policy were implemented
by the government without any objection. But Mr. Erbakan did not yield to
this 'tradition' revealing the real face of the secular military which is
supported by the West.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Mr. Erbakan had two choices regarding the future government
of Turkey: to return to its religious, cultural and historic origins and
play a major role in the Islamic world to which it belongs, or to stay where
Attaturk put it, at Europe's doorstep where the secularists can only hope
to enter. These secularists serve the West by any and all means. They also
serve Israel despite the evident U.S.-Israeli aggression on the region which
endangers the interests of Turkey as well as the surrounding countries.
Despite their efforts, they are still unable to establish a foothold in
Europe. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is one point that should not be ignored: Mr. Erbakan's
achievements during his one year in government were the fruits of his efforts
over the past 20 years. The cheating, deception and pressure by the secular
powers, both the right and left wings, in order to force Mr. Erbakan to
hand over the power, should not be viewed as a victory for the secularists
over the Islamist party in Turkey. Many points to the contrary can be easily
observed:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- All right and left parties in the secular camp found
themselves forced to meet in order to achieve a certain goal in the short
run which was to get rid of the party (Rafah) that occupied the first rank
in the last parliamentary elections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- There is no other objective that can unite the present
coalition government parties led by Prime Minister Masout Yelmaz. They do
not have identical views regarding certain important issues such as fixing
a date for early elections, the economic policies, or the Kurdish question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Yelmaz came to power by a military order. This is enough
to make people reject such a false form of democracy and to make Rafah more
popular. The public opinion polls indicate that Rafah will easily win 30%
of the parliamentary seats in the coming elections and some expected it
will have an absolute majority!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- The major, if not the only, mission assigned for the
new government is to carry out the military scheme which aims to uproot
the Islamic trend in Turkey. This means the closing of the religious &quot;Imams&quot;
schools and institutes, which were originally established by the secularists
to control the religious trend. But later these schools became one of the
most important information channels for the Islamists. The scheme also targets
the universities which their students rebelled against Attaturk's secularism.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is a kind of political stupidity that one expects this
scheme to succeed. Attaturk's Western-made secularism has possessed all
means in the last 70 years to impose its perspectives, methods and ailing
ideas on the Turkish people in circumstances more severe than the present
ones. But the result was that the generations which abide by their religion
and civilization are the people who were born in the golden times of secularism.
Therefore, how will the next generation be in Turkey?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The international powers may support the secularists in
Turkey with all possible means, but, as usual, it is a conditional and short-term
support because the decision makers in the West are convinced that Turkey
is an Islamic country. Therefore they will never contribute to a real economic
or technological development in Turkey because, sooner or later, these achievements
will be in the hands of the Turks who are loyal to their country and to
its religion, Islam.<BR>
