<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>On who would succeed Arafat</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The talk about Yasser Arafat&iacute;s &igrave;deteriorating
health&icirc; has been rife lately in media political circles. Reports to
that effect are varied in credibility and authenticity, and some, particularly
those originating from Israeli sources, may be tendentious in nature and
even politically motivated. However, other reports leaked from inside the
not-so-hermetic PA establishment seems to be sufficiently credible to warrant
delving into the crucial question of &igrave;who would succeed Yasser Arafat?&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some reports have suggested that the Palestinian leader,
whose pundits rightly contend that he has made himself indispensable both
as Chairman of the PLO and President of the Palestinian Authority, is suffering
from a variety of symptoms, including shivering lips, trembling hands (early
symptoms of Parkinson&iacute;s disease), memory loss, occasional fainting
spells, and in general, signs of early senility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, an Israeli doctor, interviewed on Israel&iacute;s
Channel-2, said he was sure that Arafat displayed early signs of Parkinson&iacute;s
disease, the symptoms of which include muscular tremors, muscular rigidity
and progressive general weakness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, the Palestinian Authority dismisses the Israeli
&igrave;rumours&icirc; as &igrave;baseless and politically motivated.&icirc;
Nabil Amre, a close aid to Yasser Arafat, said that &igrave;Arafat&iacute;s
health was very good,&icirc; during a political seminar in Dura on 20 November.
Amre added that Israeli insinuations to that effect were aimed at creating
a PR atmosphere conducive to enabling them to evade carrying out their commitments
under the peace process, including the vital secondary redeployment from
significant parts of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;They want to tell the Americans, &euml;Look! They
have an ill leader and an unstable entity; and under such circumstances,
Israel can&iacute;t afford to give more concessions to the Palestinians&iacute;,&icirc;
Amre said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amre may be right in his prognosis of the Israeli intentions.
However, this doesn&iacute;t and shouldn&iacute;t lessen the significance
of the vital question of &igrave;who would succeed Yasser Arafat?&icirc;
if and when he departed from office for one reason or the other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat is the Chairman of the PLO, the President of the
PA; he holds all the reins, he controls all the money, he takes all the
decisions...and he, by and large, is the only law, whose authority is &igrave;respected,&icirc;
established and enforced. In fact, many Palestinians, including some intellectuals,
think that Arafat is irreplaceable if only because he has always sought,
successfully, to make himself irreplaceable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the vast bulk of Palestinians&iacute; &igrave;founding
fathers,&icirc; e.g. historical PLO leaders such as Abu Jihad, Abu Eyad,
Abu Ali Eyad, et al., were assassinated either by the Mossad or &igrave;disposed
of&icirc; in vague, mysterious and suspicious circumstances, suggesting
internal PLO conspiracy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, who would succeed Arafat if his seat became suddenly
vacant? Jebril Rajoub? Faisal Husseini? Or most probably Mahmud Abbas (Abu
Mazen)? Mere speculations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Would the Palestinians &igrave;be allowed&icirc; to have
a smooth and orderly transfer of power by electing a successor to Yasser
Arafat? That is, after all, the right and safe way to do it. However, given
the numerous inharmonious and intervening variables and parties involved,
the matter wouldn&iacute;t be easy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Determining who Arafat&iacute;s successor would be is not
and has never been an exclusively Palestinian affair. The Palestinians,
languishing for 30 years under an enduring Israeli occupation, are not free,
after all, to elect or select their leadership. Even under the PA, appointment
rather than election has been the means filling vacant offices, e.g. mayors
and other key posts requiring a people&iacute;s mandate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the United States all
have vested interests in the matter. The Israelis, for example, would strive
to make sure that any post-Arafat Palestinian leader or leadership would
have to be &igrave;acceptable&icirc; to Israel, at least as much as Arafat
has been. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jordanians, for their part, would see to it that their
vital interests are safeguarded by, for example, making sure that somebody
such as Preventive Security Chief Jebril Rajoub, who is avowedly anti-Jordanian,
didn&iacute;t become President. The realization of this Jordanian goal would
presumably be sought by reviving the Jordanian lobby in the West Bank, by
mobilizing moderate but influential Palestinian leaders such as Faisal Husseini,
or through connivance or open cooperation with Israel. But if the Jordanians
pushed for what they wanted too aggressively, it could push Rajoub to play
the &igrave;Israeli factor&icirc; with mixed prospective ramifications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Egyptians would also see to it that the new Palestinian
leadership didn&iacute;t drift away from Egypt. Interestingly, the Egyptian
leadership has succeeded to forge an almost paternal relationship with the
PA, particularly with a willing Yasser Arafat. Since the establishment of
the PA, Arafat has paid as many as 100 visits to Cairo. President Mubarak
is Arafat&iacute;s ultimate adviser, and Cairo, not Amman, has been Arafat&iacute;s
main conduit to the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is almost certain that a tense and perhaps tumultuous
period would ensue from a sudden vacancy of the combined PLO and PA chairmanships.
Conceivably, outstanding security figures, such as Rajoub in the West Bank,
and, to a lesser extent Muhammad Dahlan in the Gaza Strip, would move, probably
brutally and ruthlessly, &igrave;to impose law and order&icirc; in ways
that might enhance their own political prospects. In other words, establishing
the authority of law by Rajoub and Dahlan and their allies within Fatah
would be predisposed to serve and expedite their own political ambitions.
That would be risky, given the expected opposition by the leaders of other
PA security agencies, such as Force-17, considered the most loyal to Yasser
Arafat. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Rajoub-Dahlan coup d&iacute;&Egrave;tat would almost
certainly collide head-on, not necessarily immediately, with traditional
power bases, such as the now-dormant but potentially &igrave;problematic&icirc;
Jordanian lobby, the influential democratic-minded middle class and, of
course, the Islamist movement, who would condemn &igrave;Rajoub&iacute;s
despotism.&icirc; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nobody can be sure now how things would unfold, but Rajoub
would have to succumb, probably later than sooner, to overwhelming street
pressure, probably with a certain face-saving prize in return.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Enter Faisal Husseini</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is highly reasonable to presume that Jerusalem leader
Faisal Husseini would be the pivotal figure around whom most Palestinians
would rally in the final analysis. He is acceptable to Jordan and (to a
lesser extent) to Egypt, and to a considerable extent, to Israel. Husseini
comes from a prominent Jerusalemite family that played a central political
role in contemporary Palestinian history which makes him &igrave;a centrist&icirc;
candidate for all Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Husseini would presumably seek to outmanoeuvre Rajoub and
friends by insisting on the holding of an election in which every presidential
hopeful, e.g. Rajoub, could nominate himself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Husseini&iacute;s bid would succeed because if a fair election
were held, free from foul play, Husseini would eventually emerge as the
winner. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Husseini, in order to survive and consolidate his position
in a political environment lacking genuine democratic traditions, would
have to walk a tightrope in a political field strewn with many political
mines. Eventually, however, he would have to rely more on the &igrave;local
West Bank constituency&icirc; rather than on the traditional &igrave;PLO,&icirc;
particularly Fatah, which most likely would undergo a serious skeletal transformation
affecting its relative coherence and unity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a nutshell, the disappearance of Arafat would mark the
end of an era, which can be called &igrave;the Arafat era.&icirc; The new
post-Arafat era would not likely be characterized by the overwhelming presence
and control of one person, as is the situation now or even by one particular
movement, e.g. Fatah. A broad coalition of political and traditional forces
would conceivably replace Arafat&iacute;s existing autocracy. For good or
bad, a watershed development as such could deliver the Palestinians from
the type of autocracy that has dominated Palestinian political life for
decades.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>On the eve of the Eightieth Anniversary of
the Balfour Declaration: </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Statehood is NO Liberation</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush*</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Balfour Declaration as foundation of the present
crisis-</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 2 November 1917, the Government of the British throne
issued the infamous Balfour Declaration promising a homeland for the Jews
in Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This was before Hitler rose to power in Germany, and even
before Crystal Night. But it was long after Britain and other European colonialists
resolved to thwart any emerging Arab political unity while signing in the
meantime, with glib Arab allies like Sherrif Hussein, agreements to the
contrary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence Britain, which was occupying Palestine and other
Arab territories at the time, decided to allow a Jewish state to descend
upon the Holy Land, not out of sheer spite for the indigenous Palestinians,
but because of the strategic location of Palestine at the intercontinental
cross-roads between Asia and Africa. Take Palestine, and you take out the
heart: the Asian and African wings of the Arab (and Muslim) world are thus
separated.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Balfour Declaration is the spirit of the Oslo Agreement-</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The blunt colonialism of the first part of the twentieth
century gave way to neo-colonialism, which then gave way to the more sophisticated
New World Order. However, the ancient colonial objectives and bloodshed
(ask Iraqi children) remained the same.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Today the occupation of Palestine complements the criminal
unjust sanctions against Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Iran, and potentially Syria.
The purpose is still to subjugate our people and usurp their resources under
disguises like 'restoring democracy to Kuwait', when in fact Kuwait itself
is also targeted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But having come to grips with the inevitable reality that
Palestinian resistance to the Zionist occupation is not going to just vanish
with time, the pragmatic managers of the New World Order sought to diffuse
our indestructible urge to be free by offering harmless alternatives to
liberation that are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Consistent with the New World Order and its current
power structure;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Consistent with &igrave;Israel's&icirc; need to gradually
pass from old-style Zionism, which already accomplished most of its objectives,
to new-style Zionism, which refurbishes a Palestinian entity (call it a
state or a stake if you like) to serve as a springboard to pounce politically
and economically into Arab markets and resources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the case of the PLO leadership, the objective of liberation
was dropped for this amorphous (but realistic!) Palestinian stake. Then
that was dropped for the right to be &igrave;the sole legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people&icirc;. But from behind the representatives&iacute;
backs, a silly self-autonomy was negotiated in Oslo that turned out to be
completely bogus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yes, that is what happens to those who abandon the basic
principles ingrained in the unamended Palestinian National Charter, regardless
of good intentions. Because capitulation and resistance are habits and mentalities,
not isolated acts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, it is ridiculous to oppose Oslo, without opposing
all that led to it from the Balfour Declaration to Resolution 242 to the
Madrid Conference, held in 1991 after the second Gulf war and subsequent
collapse of the former USSR.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Palestinian mini- or quasi-entity is NO liberation. Liberation
is to completely reverse the physical manifestations of the Balfour Declaration,
not a slick 'take 2%?better than nothing'!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But to those disbelievers and naysayers in our midst, we
should say, &quot;Look at the former USSR and the Shah of Iran! Only one
year before their doom none would have believed that their pending collapse
was 'realistic', but those who sow the wind shall reap the storm.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>When a small child dies for want of a pencil</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E.Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not certain what the young boy had been doing when
he was cut down so cruelly on 11 November. What is known is that the child
had left his humble home to buy some pencils.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He had been doing wonderfully in school. It was only a
few days before that he had shown his mother his report card. His face beamed
when she proudly studied his grades and said, &quot;Son, I am proud of you!
Keep up the good work!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Though the conditions of the Aida refugee camp (not too
far from Bethlehem) where young Ali Jawarish lived, were crowded, and schools
poorly equipped; he had developed a love for knowledge and his parents had
hopes that one day the boy would be able to not only provide for his own
needs successfully but that he also would benefit his country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He had not been taught to throw stones. He had not been
taught to hate. But he had been encouraged inspite of his poor living conditions
to love life. It was with this love of life that Ali had skipped to the
stationary store that was just up the road close to Rachel's Tomb, which
is an Israeli enclave where some 30,000 Israelis, mostly ultra-Orthodox,
attended a ceremony. The boy wanted to buy some pencils so he could do his
homework. The small child had no premeditated intentions of harming Israeli
soldiers or of resisting the cruel and brutal occupation of his land, the
same land that belonged to his forefathers long before the boy was born.
And just how much damage can a small boy do anyway against live ammunition
and soldiers armed to the teeth to protect themselves from the stones of
young children? Soldiers who are intruders and aliens in a land not their
own. Soldiers who implement the daily brutality and enforce the tyranny
of the confiscation of Palestinian land and Palestinian lives. Soldiers
who do not hesitate to shoot at small children with the intent to kill or
maim in order to crush any form of resistance, even from tiny hands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is such that young heroes are made. The blood of Ali
has watered the ground of Palestine whose streets have become rivers of
blood fed by the hearts and souls of Palestinians who have bravely struggled
for their freedom from slavery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not certain whether Ali had stopped to join the other
young boys who were throwing stones at the Israeli soldiers or if he was
just caught in the trouble that ensued. What is certain is that the child,
guilty of no crime, was cut down in cold blood by a rubber bullet shot from
the gun of an Israeli soldier. The bullet struck the boy in the head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A man, who had witnessed the shooting of the youth, rushed
to the child's side and evacuated him. He picked up the pieces of what was
left of small Ali. As the rescuer stated, &quot;The boy was on the ground,
his head open, with brain and fluid running out.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The boy remained in a coma in a hospital with severe brain
damage and was kept on life support for four days until he died. Just before
his death, his parents decided to donate his organs to save the lives of
others. Ali's parents did not stipulate who the organs were to go to and
did not care if the recipients were Arab or Israeli.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As it happens, Ali's younger sister needed a kidney transplant
because she suffers from kidney failure, but in the trauma of the tragic
moment, Ali's parents, numbed by pain and loss, forgot the younger sister.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The remains of Ali's body were carried to a grave newly
dug near Bethlehem, just the size of the small boy. Some six hundred mourners
kept the body of the boy martyr company on his last earthly journey from
his home to the graveyard behind Rachel's Tomb. The child's face was uncovered
showing the bullet wound that had fatally wounded him. Even as the small
body was being lowered into the miniature grave, a group of youths began
throwing stones at nearby Israeli soldiers and chanted slogans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before he died, Ali's mother Laila, said, &quot;I know
we are enemies, the Arabs and the Jews-but he is only nine years old! I
wish they had arrested him, I wish they had beaten him, but not this!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is an ongoing tragedy that small boys like Ali are struck
down, that their lives are ruthlessly cut so short, that an innocent child
is killed just because he was on his way to buy pencils so he could do his
homework.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is talk of peace, yet all around there is war and
killing. How can there ever be peace when settlements continue, when Palestinians
are prisoners in concentration camps, when Palestinian land is confiscated,
when Palestinian homes are demolished, and when the streets of Palestine
have become rivers of blood? Tyranny never breeds peace. Injustice can never
be forgotten. A ruthless occupation can only expect resistance even if the
Palestinians are unarmed and many of the clashes involve only small stones
thrown by the hands of young children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A country such as Israel built on murder, theft of land,
oppression, injustice, and brutal savage tyranny, will one day collapse
for such foundations are not only against humanity itself, but violate the
laws of God who watches and will not forget.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Small Ali is now in heaven. He has found peace and will
no longer suffer the pain of seeing death and despair all around him. The
Israeli soldier who took his young life should hate himself and will never
be able to wash the stain of little Ali's blood from his hands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When Ali's father, Mohammed Jawarish, agreed to donate
his son's organs to those in need, he said, &quot;I gave the organs as a
religious deed. It doesn't matter who the children are who received them,
just as long as they live.&quot; He then broke down in tears.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As it so happens, three Arab-Israeli children received
the organs in operations performed in a hospital in Petach Tikva outside
Tel Aviv. A fourteen year old boy with cystic fibrosis got Ali's heart and
two lungs, and an 11 year old who suffered from a liver disease received
the liver and a kidney. The other kidney was transplanted into a year old
Bedouin infant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Through his donated organs, and because of his martyrdom,
Ali will live forever and be added to the long list of Palestinians who
gave their lives for the freedom of their country.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Thou Shalt Not Kill Who?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By John Hartung*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zionism comes from the bowels of the Bible. In a display
of chutzpah even more galling than the Balfour Declaration, the first Zionists
invented a god who commanded them to commit genocide. After declaring that
their god gave them land which had belonged to other people for hundreds
of years, the spiritual ancestors of today's Zionists embarked upon a campaign
of mass murder:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God gives
you for an inheritance you shall save alive nothing that breathes, but you
shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites
and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the Lord your God
has commanded (Deuteronomy 20:16-17).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jebusites were the people of Jerusalem, and like the
other nations that were slated for destruction, they had no quarrel with
the Israelites. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that The People Of The
Book were bent on genocide according to the modern definition of the word:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They should be utterly destroyed and should receive no
mercy but be </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>exterminated, as the Lord commanded Moses . . Utterly destroy
all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant
and suckling (Joshua 11:20 . . . First Samuel 15:3).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, this was to be a Holocaust:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And as explained by Maimonides, Judaism's most respected
scholar of the Bible, this Holocaust was a mandatory commandment from the
god of Jacob, the patriarch whose name was changed to Israel:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is a positive commandment to destroy the seven nations,
as it is said: &quot;Thou shalt utterly destroy them.&quot; If one does
not put to death any of them that falls into one's power, one transgresses
a negative commandment, as it is said: &quot;Thou shalt save alive nothing
that breathes&quot; (Maimonides' Book of Judges, 5:4, circa. 1195).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule also come
from the Bible. The most famous of the Ten Commandments is &quot;Thou shalt
not kill,&quot; and the Golden Rule says &quot;Love thy neighbor as thy
self.&quot; How can this be? In order to understand the heart of Zionism,
this apparent contradiction must be understood in its original context.
Consider three translations of Leviticus 19:18 -- the biblical verse from
which the Golden Rule has been extracted:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>. Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. [King
James Version of the Bible, and the first Jewish Publication Society translation]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You shall not take vengeance or bear any grudge against
the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[Revised Standard Version]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your
countrymen. Love your fellow as yourself. [TANAKH, most recent Jewish Publication
Society translation]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In context, &quot;neighbor&quot; meant &quot;the children
of thy people,&quot; &quot;the sons of your own people,&quot; &quot;your
countrymen&quot; -- in other words, fellow Israelites. Keep this definition
of &quot;neighbor&quot; in mind as we consider the proto-legal portion of
The Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 5:17-21):</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Thou shalt not kill.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither shalt thou commit adultery.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither shalt thou steal.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; and you shall
not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant,
his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor's.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>-- and remember that there was no punctuation in the original.
That is, the scrolls from which these words were translated have no periods,
no commas, and no first-word capitalization. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Here the question 'Thou shalt not kill who?' is answered:
'Thou shalt not kill thy neighbor . . . the children of thy people . . .
the sons of your own people . . your countrymen . . . fellow Israelis .
. . fellow Jews. How unconventional is this interpretation? Not very. The
rabbis of The Talmud, Judaism's most respected explication of the Bible,
determined that an Israelite was not liable for murder unless he intentionally
killed a fellow Israelite. Maimonides put it like this (Book of Torts 5:1:1
. . . 5:2:11):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If one slays a single Israelite, he transgresses a negative
commandment, for Scripture says, Thou Shalt not murder. If one murders willfully
in the presence of witnesses, he is put to death by the sword . . . Needless
to say, one is not put to death if he kills a heathen. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This understanding of &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; allows
us to see why the first Commander-and-Chief of the Israeli Defense Forces
was not guilty of hypocrisy. According to the Bible, Joshua initiated the
most successful campaign of genocide in world history -- a campaign in which
over 400 named cities were &quot;utterly destroyed.&quot; The first city
to fall was Jericho, where every man, woman and child was &quot;put to the
sword&quot; because they were not People of The Book. The second city to
fall was much smaller, only 12,000 people, but Joshua took 30,000 soldiers
to massacre Ai. After a long day of killing he gathered his troops and carved
the Ten Commandments in stone -- including &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;
(Joshua 8:24 25, 30-32): </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants
of Ai . . . and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the
sword . . . all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand,
all the people of Ai. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>. . then Joshua built an altar and they offered on it burnt
offerings to the Lord . . . And there, in the presence of the people of
Israel, he wrote upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Joshua was not a hypocrite because there is no conflict
inherent to not killing &quot;the children of thy people,&quot; while killing
other people's children with enthusiasm. In fact, Joshua was greatly dismayed
about his conquest of Ai because unlike Jericho, where he did not lose a
single soldier, Joshua lost 3 Israelites for every thousand people killed
at Ai. Today's Zionists are more pleased by such kill ratios:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;According to figures provided by Minister of the
Interior Yosef Burg, in 1980 ten Jews were killed by 'terrorists' and in
1981 eight. In contrast, we have killed about a thousand 'terrorists' in
1982, and caused the loss of life of thousands of inhabitants of an enemy
country. If so, it results that for every 6-8 Jews sacrificed, we kill in
return thousands of Gentiles. This is, undoubtedly, a spectacular situation,
an uncommon success of Zionism.&quot; (Aluf Hareven, former head of the
Van Leer Institute, on Israel's invasion of Lebanon, from Migvan, October/November,
1982)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A proper understanding of &quot;the law of Moses&quot;
even makes it possible to comprehend current interpretations of Israeli
law ( New York Newsday 10/15/91, p 14):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli Justice Ministry official suggested in a letter
that a Palestinian benefited when Israeli soldiers killed his wife. The
letter was written by Pliya Albeck, chief of the civil department at the
attorney general's office, legislator Yossi Sarid said. Israeli radio said
the Palestinian woman, Safiyah Suleiman Gargour, 63, was beaten and then
shot to death by soldiers in May, 1990 while working in her garden in Khan
Yunis in the occupied Gaza Strip. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You should claim that the plaintiff has only benefited
from the death of the deceased (his wife). He has benefited, because during
her life, he had to provide for her, and now he does not have to do so.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So it is that from a Zionist perspective, when the brains
of seven year-old Ali Jawarish came &quot;oozing from a hole in his forehead
where he had been shot at close range by an Israeli soldier firing on fleeing
young stone-throwers,&quot; it was not wrong. It did not disrupt &quot;the
grand opening of a new fortified complex encasing Rachel's Tomb.&quot; It
did not dampen &quot;The festivities, attended by hundreds of strictly Orthodox
Jews, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Israel's two Chief Rabbis.&quot;
It did not violate any of the Ten Commandments while &quot;Women in kerchiefs
and long dresses and men in black coats and hats lighted memorial candles
and swayed over prayer-books in separate prayer sections,&quot; and &quot;Followers
of a Hasidic sect hawked religious books and danced to religious music blaring
from loudspeakers&quot; while Yitzhak Mordechai told the crowd &quot;We
have come to this place and we will never leave it, until the coming of
the redeemer&quot; (New York Times, November 12, 1997).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No, to Zionists the killing of Ali Jawarish was not wrong.
To Zionists the family of Ali Jawarish has only benefited, because during
Ali's life, they had to provide for him, and now they do not have to do
so. For more secular Jewish and Christian Zionists, the killing of Ali Jawarish
was not wrong because it was just one more unfortunate incident in the natural
unfolding of history . . . it was just another day. But for religious Zionists,
the killing a Ali Jawarish was not wrong because he was a heathen. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How can Palestinians defend themselves against so many
religious fantasies lurking in the hearts of so many people? The key insight,
I think, is that a fundamental sense of justice also lives in the vast majority
of those hearts. At one end of the spectrum, that sense of justice is overwhelmed
by allegiance to the god of genocide, but at the other end of the spectrum,
that sense of justice can be caused to overwhelm a dimly perceived identification
with Zionist perversions of justice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of what use is that insight? It leads to the realization
that an appeal to the sense of justice that lives within the most just hearts
could have a profound effect. Those hearts could, in turn, have a profound
effect on hearts of moderate Zionists, and those hearts could have a profound
effect on more ardent Zionists, and so on down the line until only the Zealots
would be left. Fortunately, the Jabotinskys, Meir Kahanes, Baruch Goldsteins,
Yigal Amirs and Netanyahus of this world are such a small minority that
they could be overwhelmed by better people's sense of justice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How could a chain reaction of justice be initiated? Here
the key is to propose a just solution -- a solution that will appeal the
first link in the chain. Again, I urge Palestinians to propose a new nation
-- a final settlement in which Israel, without the Golan Heights, joins
the West Bank and Gaza. This new country should not be called Israel and
it should not be called Palestine. Any other name would be acceptable, but
I suggest New Canaan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because the United States has been critically responsible
for creating the circumstances which require such a major solution, America
should guarantee the security of New Canaan's international borders for
fifteen years subsequent to its creation and grant expedited U.S. citizenship
to any former Israeli citizen of New Canaan who wishes to immigrate to the
United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Boys throw stones because they do not know a better way
to fight for justice. Zealots kill them and they would gladly kill every
non-Jew who lives in any land that they believe their god gave them &quot;for
an inheritance.&quot; For the sake of the boys who throw stones, for the
sake of their courage, and for the sake of their objective, let us find
a better way to fight for justice.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Indonesian Muslim Community and the Question
of Palestine</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The following is a paper presented by Riza Sihbudi at
the United Nations Asian Seminar and NGO Symposium on the Question of Palestine,
Jakarta, Indonesia, 4-7 May 1997.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 10 April 1997, Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Mr. Ali Alatas, said that the Indonesian government insists that all countries
with clout should encourage Israel to resume peace talks and stop building
the Jewish settlements in the East Jerusalem. The government was very concerned
by the violence around Al-Quds, which lead to more bloodshed (The Jakarta
Post, 11 April 1997).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, on 11 April, according to its Deputy Chairman,
Mr. Ahmad Sumargono, the Indonesian Committee for World Muslim Solidarity
(KISDI)?an Indonesian Islamic NGO?has started recruiting students and interested
Muslims to join an &quot;anti-Zionist task force&quot; (The Jakarta Post,
12 April 1997). The Committee has organized massive demonstrations for the
Palestinian cause in the past.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statements by Mr. Alatas and Mr. Sumargono are reflecting
the attention of the Indonesian government and the people to the Palestinian
question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is a chance that the current Palestinian-Israeli
dispute will plunge the Middle East into further conflict. The most recent
tensions emerged as a result of Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to build the Jewish
settlements in Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa), located near the holy city of
Al-Quds (Jerusalem). Netanyahu's project has drawn strong opposition from
several quarters, notably the Muslim countries, but also the Palestine National
Authority (PNA) led by Mr. Yasser Arafat, and even some countries in the
West?not including the United States?have expressed objections to the project.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are two main factors underlying this opposition to
Netanyahu's project. First, Al-Quds is widely envisaged as the future capitol
of an independent Palestine by the PNA and the majority of Palestinians.
Secondly, in 1993 and 1995, tripartite agreements were signed between the
PLO, Israel, and the US stating that final status of Al-Quds would be discussed
in 1998. PNA negotiators argue that Netanyahu's project transgresses these
agreements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu seems vulnerable to pressure from the Jewish
extremist groups in his country. Many of these hard-liners have opposed
the US-sponsored Middle East peace process from its inception. Some Middle
East analysts maintain that Netanyahu drew on the support of these hard-liners
in his recent victory over Shimon Peres. In turn, Netanyahu's reconciliatory
approach towards the Arab nations led the nickname &quot;best Israeli for
the Arabs&quot; with some sectors of the populace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's government itself is a coalition of right wing
extremists, who emphasize Israel's security at the expense of the peace
process. It would be political suicide for Netanyahu to ignore their influence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Israeli political elite seems to understand
that the stern warnings from abroad, mainly from the West, represent more
than mere &quot;rhetoric to pacify the Arabs&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As is typical with the politics of the Middle East, the
international community has frequently issued loud, yet hollow, condemnations.
But the outside world lacks both the ability and the willpower to enforce
peace and justice in the Middle East. The US veto against the two UN Security
Council resolutions in opposition to Netanyahu's project at Jabal Abu Ghneim
reveals the hypocrisy of the West, both in its claims to be a champion of
human rights and of democracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One popular, but unrealistic, explanation is that growing
international pressure will allow Netanyahu to persuade hard-liners that
his project at Jabal Abu Ghneim must be abandoned. Perhaps this &quot;thesis&quot;
could hold if Labor figures such as Mr. Peres or the late Yitzhak Rabin
still governed Israel?men who were &quot;more&quot; serious about the peace
process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The attitude of the Arab countries is no less ironic. Seemingly
they have made less serious attempts to defend the Palestinians. This strengthens
a perception of the &quot;death&quot; of Pan-Arabism. According to some
political analysts, there are two factors behind the ambiguous attitude
of the Arab world. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>First, the birth of an independent Palestine would be &quot;alarming&quot;
for many Arab states. These nations may perceive an &quot;intellectual rivalry&quot;
with the Palestinian nation. To push for Palestinian independence would
seem to be tantamount to creating a &quot;second&quot; Israel. Secondly,
regional organizations such as the Arab League, the OIC, or the OPEC, are
dominated by oil-rich states, which?ideologically?are close allies of the
US. It is unrealistic to think that they would take a stance that was contrary
to US interests (only at the Cairo meeting, April 1997, did the Arab League
foreign ministers have the guts to take a common stand to freeze all Arab-Israeli
relationships. However, we have not seen any concrete action on this stand
yet). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In this situation, only a &quot;miracle&quot; can save
the peace process. It is no wonder that in the past few weeks there has
been a resurgence of the intifadah resistance. For these young Palestinians,
the intifadah is the only means to oppose Israel, which is backed by the
West. Perhaps they believe that God only helps those who help themselves.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If the above analysis is accurate, protracted conflict
is the most likely scenario in the Middle East. Is this what the US and
other arms manufacturers want?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On his return from a visit to Jordan, November 1996, President
Soeharto of Indonesia appealed to his Muslim community to perform the Haj
pilgrimage, the fifth tenet of Islam, only once. The number of Indonesian
Haj candidates has been increasing over the years beyond the quota set by
the Saudi government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The President has recommended instead that Indonesian Muslims
step up their Umrah pilgrimage during the fasting month, Ramadhan. They
can make a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; to the Al Aqsa Mosque in the holy city
of Al-Quds, via Amman, Jordan. The President said his call should also apply
to Indonesian Christians who want to make their pilgrimage to Christian
holy places in occupied Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Soeharto&iacute;s recommendation carries with it economic
and political implications wider than mere spiritual appeal. His recommendation
is part of an agreement reached between him and King Hussein of Jordan to
step up bilateral economic relations between Indonesia and Jordan. Garuda
Indonesia, the Indonesian flag carrier, for example, plans to open a direct
flight between Jakarta and Amman, which so far has only been served by the
Royal Jordanian Airlines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If this plan takes shape, more Indonesian tourists will
travel to Jordan, and more Jordanians will visit Indonesia. Increased tourism
travel will increase the foreign exchange revenues of both countries. The
other political-economy aspects of his recommendation are linked to Indonesian-Israeli
relations. Soeharto's appeal implies that Jakarta is making a move toward
establishing official relations with Israel. Why?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Up till now?and no one knows until when?parts of Al-Quds
remain under Israel's control. Therefore, if Indonesians of any creed visit
Al-Quds via Amman in great numbers, not only Jordan, but also Israel, will
benefit from it. In such a situation, Israel would profit, both economically
and politically, more than Jordan would. Tourists will stay longer in Al-Quds
because of its religious and historical value, while Jordan can offer only
the usual tourist fare of the Dead Sea and Petra.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Prominent Indonesian Muslims are concerned that if more
Indonesians visit Al-Quds they will become sympathetic toward Israel, which
manages this holy city. Indonesian people may forget the Palestinians' struggle
to recapture Al-Quds. Perhaps they will fear that if the holy city is returned
to Palestine, they will no longer be able to enjoy its beauty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indonesia has long been known as a consistent defender
of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of the Arab lands.
If Israel gains politically and economically (thanks to the &quot;invasion&quot;
of Indonesian tourists), it becomes less likely that the Jewish state will
return Al-Quds to the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps this conis justified, perhaps not. What is more
interesting to study is political speculation over Indonesian-Israeli relations
behind President Soeharto's statement. It is rumoured that after Israel
failed to accelerate the establishment of relations with Indonesia?among
others through two meetings between President Soeharto and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in Jakarta (1993) and New York (1995)?it is now endeavouring
to make use of the &quot;Jordanian channel&quot;. Jordan (in 1994) is the
second Arab country?after Egypt (in 1979)?which has recognized Israel and
made peace accords with the Jewish state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whether the &quot;Jordanian channel&quot; is more effective
remains a question. It is certain that Israel has never given up hope of
establishing official relations with Indonesia. So far, Indonesian-Israeli
relations have been conducted largely in secret. The Far Eastern Economic
Review reported that Indonesian troops successfully freed a number of hostages
in Irian Jaya (Indonesia's eastern province) in part because of the procurement
of very sophisticated military equipment which &quot;Jakarta received from
Israel&quot; (Far Eastern Economic Review, 30 May 1996). The report has
never been refuted openly by the Indonesian government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, it is no longer a secret that an Israeli senior
diplomat assigned to a country of the Association of South East Asian Nations
(ASEAN) visits Jakarta fairly often. Indonesia has also openly received
athletes from Israel several times. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What then are the advantages and the drawbacks if Indonesia
makes official relations with Israel? Economically speaking, Indonesia will
not profit from establishing relations with Israel. The Jewish state has
a population of only 4.9 million, which is not large enough to be a significant
market for Indonesian products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, by establishing relations with Israel, would
Indonesia be violating its own Constitution, which opposes &quot;all forms
of colonization on earth&quot;? (Is Israel not occupying Arab/Palestinian
territory now?)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are benefits, of course. Considering Israel's strong
ties with the US and other Western countries, if Jakarta makes its relations
with Tel Aviv official, it is possible that its bargaining position in the
West will also improve. And, it is possible that official establishment
of Indonesian-Israeli relations would persuade American lobbyists to halt
the anti-Indonesia campaign regarding the matter of East Timor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If Jakarta had to choose between opening and not opening
diplomatic relations with Israel, maybe the majority of Indonesian people
would choose the second alternative. However, if the option is between the
official opening of relations or covert relations, the first alternative
is clearly preferable. For the sake of political education, the people should
not be continuously deceived, and covert relations with Israel are tantamount
to deception. The problem is, are Indonesian decision-makers capable of
convincing their Muslim people on this matter?</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>III. Realities of the Pan-Islamic Revival</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is Islam, whose one billion adherents form a majority
in more than 48 countries and a rapidly growing minority in Europe and America,
that has been presented in the Middle East region and along its periphery
as the ideological alternative to the West. The United States has been forced
by these developments to slightly adapt its instruments of policy implementation
in the Muslim world. This is true especially following recent developments
in Turkey, where a new Islamist government has been voted into power by
way of a free and democratic election. Since the end of the Cold war, Islamism,
despite repeated official denials, has been the bogeyman haunting U.S foreign
policy makers. But the United States has recently been forced to quietly,
though reluctantly, accept the fact that an Islamist party has emerged as
the leader of a NATO member country.The question that arises is, why didn't
the Israeli lobby attempt to influence the U.S. policy toward the election
outcome as it did in the Algerian misadventure? We would argue that they
did. It would be, without doubt, in their interest to block the American
acceptance of the Islamist party in Turkey, but even the Israeli lobby has
its limits of influence. It seems that in this one case, Washington understood
that any serious attempts to obstruct the Islamist movement in Turkey by
oppressive means would be ineffective and counterproductive, as it has indeed
been in many other instances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The United States would do well to follow the same wise
course of relative non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries
as it has in Turkey. This would be a constructive way to approach the region
and to ensure a permanent friendship between America and the Muslim peoples
of the East, a friendship which would certainly be most beneficial to all
the peoples involved, including the American people. Such respect for the
rights of sovereign peoples to conduct their own affairs and bilateral relationships
according to their own priorities, if adopted as policy by the United States,
would begin to convince the majority of the region's inhabitants that the
United States has changed its ways, that it now possesses genuine good intentions
toward them and their future, and that it looks favorably upon their well-being,
as it seems to do with peoples in other regions of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamist movement has been strengthened in part precisely
because of United States intervention in the internal affairs of Middle
Eastern nations, especially its role in providing overwhelming material
assistance to sustain governments that have become widely unpopular with
their own people. Those governments, in return, promise to combat the common
&quot;Islamist threat,&quot; usually cast in the terms of &quot;terrorism.&quot;
Unfortunately, the United States has gradually come to accept this definition
of terrorism in practice, despite the fact that many of these groups are
nothing more than local opposition movements who would ordinarily pose a
threat to no one except their home governments, and has needlessly created
animosities among some of the members of those movements toward the United
States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Though &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; remains an obsessive
concern, U.S. policy makers have found it necessary to delve deeper into
the complexities of Islam and Islamism rather than relying exclusively on
the simplistic constructs that were initially fed to them by the pro-Israeli
forces in their country. Muslim American organizations have played a role
in this regard, in increasing American awareness of these complexities.
And for that, even the Muslim American mainstream has been targeted as an
enemy and &quot;supporters of terrorism&quot; by pro-Israeli opinion in
the United States, albeit mostly by its more crude propagandists, such as
Steven Emerson, producer of Jihad in America rather than by its serious
political thinkers. The fact that they are being targeted by such persons
is evidence that the Israelis have taken notice of them, which means that
they are perhaps making some headway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, the United States has not even begun to
re-think the basic parameters within which it defines its &quot;vital&quot;
foreign policy interests and objectives, despite the long-term and deep
resentment that is created in Middle Eastern public opinion, religious and
secular, toward the United States government because of its Israeli-inspired
Middle East policy. Despite the increasing potential for confrontation,
Washington continues to act negatively toward many of the Middle Eastern
peoples and to exert unwarranted political and economic pressure on them,
both directly and indirectly with the help of its client governments in
the region. Instead of finding ways to mitigate the resentments of the people,
Washington continues to intensify them.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>IV. Putting Confrontation Aside: Beyond
the Current United States Position</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To go beyond the present approach, the United States needs
to frame a policy that acknowledges the broad scope of the Mideast challenge
and adopts new principles of action. To begin with, the U.S. government
should better understand the extent and implication of the factors at play
in the Islamic revival currently sweeping through the Middle East and, thereby,
lay the groundwork for genuine, effectual policy formulation and planning.
This should be a priority for the foreign policy community, which should
center its endeavors on equipping policy makers with the facts and analysis
they need to construct genuine and impartial policies toward this key region
and great religion. Counter-terrorism is not an appropriate platform from
which to face the peoples of this important region at a time when they are
about to undergo a process of great social change and political upheaval.
To the contrary, the policy community should seek to acquire the requisite
regional political and religious knowledge of Muslim countries so as to
make possible closer and more friendly relations. This will enable the United
States to begin to construct its relations with regional states and their
peoples on the basis of mutual understanding, equality, and respect, rather
than on submission, subservience, or dependency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, the United States, while recognizing the sovereignty
of nations that abide by the United Nations Charter, should encourage political
liberalization from its client governments, to allow for the political participation
of the populations in question. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While there is nothing wrong with maintaining normal relations
with such governments as the effective rulers of sovereign states and legitimate
participants in the international community, there is something wrong to
vowing to defend them at almost any cost, especially from their own populations,
and it is wrong to brand their political oppositions as terrorist organizations
just because they use violent means. Political violence conducted by a non-state
actor is not necessarily terrorism, for it is a fact that in undemocratic
countries, or in nations whose people live under foreign occupation (in
whatever form), violence may be the only means to bring about political
change, since all other options that might be effective toward reaching
those goals are legally closed. The experience of Turkey illustrates that
where democratic change is possible, Islamists show little penchant for
violent action. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This lesson should have been learned by the United States
in Iran, where its conspicuous and unabated support for the shah, and its
building and maintenance of the SAVAK (the shah's hated internal intelligence
service) brought about deep resentment on the part of the Iranian people,
thereby bringing the wrath of the Iranian opposition down on the head of
the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, hostile intervention in the internal affairs
of peoples, and the use of forcible means, including overwhelming political
or economic pressure and other forms of harassment used to enforce one's
own policy preferences against another people in their own country and region,
is no way to conduct policy in a post-Cold war era. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lastly, the United States should act as a steady policy
counsel and act in an auxiliary manner with governments in the Muslim world
to communicate with their populaces on the dual track of increasing participation
in government and enabling the free market forces as expeditiously as their
particular circumstances permit. Jordan's parliamentary opening to the Muslim
Brotherhood was initially thought to be an important development and case
study in political reform, although it has been followed up by the government's
systematic co-optation of potential opponents as a form of political neutralization,
which has negated the initially positive results of the reform.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At the same time, the United States should also promote
market economies and privatization with expanded capital ownership through
innovative credit mechanisms, such as the ESOP popularized in America to
broader share-owning opportunities, as the most effective approach, in the
final analysis, to help governments diminish the manifestations of social
injustice that give rise to hatred. In so doing one must be sensitive to
the complexities involved. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A key element in the region's future will be effective
political dialogue between governments and a broad spectrum of their societies,
coupled with viable economic policies that benefit large sectors of the
populations involved and lead to the universalization of stock-ownership
in well-managed companies, especially by their own employees. The United
States can and should offer its good offices in this regard; this will also
help to repair its long-term relations with the Muslims in general and with
Islamist movements in particular. It should tailor its relations with each
country in a unique manner, while allowing the critical processes of political
change to proceed normally in these countries, without interference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It should be understood that once political change is complete,
these countries will insist on preserving their hard-won independence, especially
in the critical areas of foreign policy, and the United States should take
this into account in formulating its relations with them. It should also
be understood that Western political models will not necessarily emerge
in many of the societies that are traditionalist in nature. The Muslims
have their own form of political consultation known as shura, and this type
of institution can be expanded along the lines of democratic principles
in a social and constitutional environment informed by universal principles
of justice.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>V. Bridges versus Walls</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In conclusion, instead of building walls, Washington needs
to build bridges. Indeed, the challenge before it on the eve of the new
millennium is to determine how the United States can create a true and friendly
relationship with the world's ever increasing Islamic population. The elements
of a comprehensive policy as outlined in this document would enhance the
prospects for preventive diplomacy and peaceful conflict resolution. International
organizations could definitely be of help in structuring the parameters
of dialogue to improve U.S.-Muslim relations, especially in achieving an
atmosphere of tolerance between the United States and Iran and Sudan, perhaps
even with political movements such as Hamas and the Algerian FIS, and with
many others including the once highly confrontational Libya. By learning
how to act creatively and assertively, but not intrusively, and by not overreacting
to the day-to-day foreign policies of small countries and movements, the
United States can demonstrate its good intentions toward the peoples of
the Muslim world at this important historic crossroads in which they are
now arriving.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The efforts of the Israeli lobbying forces to undermine
the potential for positive relations between the United States and the Islamic
revival can certainly be limited if American policy makers come to understand
the dangers presented by the influence of foreign lobbyists, especially
in the domain of Middle East politics in general and in the realm of America's
interaction with Islamist movements in particular. It is genuinely hoped
that the United States will back away from confrontation and try re-conciliation
with the peoples and nations in the world with whom it has differences of
opinion. Nowhere is this more important than in the Middle East and the
Muslim world at large.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Politics of Islamophobia</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Yaqub Zaki</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>(1-3)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamophobia is as old as Islam; it began with Quraish.
Its intensity varies according to time and place, but hatred of Islam and
Muslims is endemic in the European psyche?endemic even if at times it becomes
epidemic. We are living through such an epidemic now, and because it is
not the first, it will surely not be the last. By my calculation, the present
epidemic is the fifth in the past 170 years. A tidal wave of Islamophobia
swept Britain at the time of the Greek war of independence. Lord Byron went
off to die for the Greeks; the Greek Committee was set up in London, and
most amazingly of all, in an incident which has never been satisfactorily
explained, a British admiral ordered the launching of the British fleet
in the Mediterranean against the Turkish navy in Navarino Bay without the
permission of the Admiralty or a state of war existing between the two countries.
A second wave gripped Britain at the time of the Mutiny, 1857-1858, a third,
led by Gladstone and the Liberal Party, at the time of the Eastern Question
(the Serbian and Bulgarian wars), and a fourth at the time of the Armenian
massacres, real or alleged, during World War I. After that, it abated somewhat
and Germanophobia took its place until the revolution in Iran upset the
global power equation. The last reason for the abatement of Islamophobia
was because the defeat of the Caliphate till 1979-Islam as a political power
was in eclipse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Presently, Islamophobia is undergoing a revival because
of the Cold Warriors&iacute; need for a post-war target to replace communism.
In Thatcherite Britain, an Anglocentric Britishness was deployed deliberately
by a whole range of hegemonic interests. Thatcher herself was quite explicit:
Islam is the enemy that replaces a defunct communism. In the definition
of &igrave;otherness&icirc;, Islam assumes a special significance denied
to communism. This is because there is not one Islamophobia but several;
there is religious Islamophobia, political Islamophobia and cultural Islamophobia.
In the Cold War era, the definition of the other was mainly by economic
criteria. But Muslim otherness goes much deeper; it is cultural, it is political,
and it is religious. Sometimes it is difficult to separate the various strands.
The blunt anti-Islamic utterance of Thatcher is more subtly modulated through
the attempts of an unhappy intelligentsia, whose outlook is conditioned
by a Eurocentric cultural tradition, to come to terms with the reduction
of Britain to the status of a third-rate power and the simultaneous reality
of a resurgent Islam. It took them by surprise because Islam had been discounted
for so long. This happened moreover at a time of moral and cultural decadence
in Europe. The result is an arrogant but basically insecure intelligentsia
whose utterances are reminiscent of the Crusades; they are cultural Crusaders
whose work underpins and justifies that of the political Crusaders like
Douglas Hurd. To these intellectuals there is available an historical repertoire
of anti-Islamic imagery and vocabulary, freely drawn upon to vilify any
system alien to their own. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I repeat: there is not one Islamophobia but many; as the
devil said, our name is legion. There is British Islamophobia, scarcely
distinguishable from French Islamophobia, both of which arise from an historical
colonial experience in which &igrave;Muslim&icirc; is not merely perceived
as the other (like during the Crusades) but as the inferior other. There
is Spanish Islamophobia, muted during the Franco era but now being revived.
There is even German Islamophobia, carried out by people seemingly unaware
of the fact that Turkey was Germany's ally during the First World War. There
is lastly international, or Zionist, Islamophobia, which merges indistinguishably
with any of the above variants.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Presently, we live in a political age, so Islamophobia
accordingly assumes a political aspect. It was not always so. Luther feared
an alliance of the two things he hated most, Muslims and Catholics: for
'unbelievable,' he said, 'is the malice of Satan.' A famous Lutheran hymn
begins:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Erhalt uns Herr bei deinem Worst</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>und steur des Babsts und Tirken Mord.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>(Uphold us, O Lord, in your word </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And send murder to the Pope and the Turks.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Turks meant Muslims; the phrase 'to turn Turk,' used from
the 16th century to the 18th, means to convert to Islam.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As an instance of Islamophobia, you may think it difficult
to improve upon Peregrine Worthshorne's 'Islam must be destroyed, as Carthage
was destroyed' (apropos of the Gulf War), but what about this, from Charles
Dickens? '&Ouml; I wish I were Commander-in-Chief in India. The first thing
I would do is to strike that Oriental race with amazement &Ouml;should be
to proclaim to them, in their language, that I considered my holding that
appointment by the leave of God, to mean that I should do my utmost to exterminate
the Race upon whom the strain of the late cruelties rested [referring to
the uprising of 1857]; and that I begged them to do to me the favour to
observe that I was there for that purpose and no other, and was now proceeding,
with all convenient dispatch and merciful swiftness of execution, to blot
it out of mankind and raze it off the face of the Earth.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The very next day, 5 October 1857, he repeated himself:
'Again and again, I have said to Ladies, spirited enough and handsome enough
and clever enough to have known better &quot;what on earth do you see in
those men to go mad about? You know faces, when they are not brown; you
know common expressions, when they are not under turbans; Look at the dogs?low,
treacherous, murderous, tigerous villains who despise you while you pay
court to them, and who would rend you to pieces at half an hour's notice&quot;.
'&Ouml; I wish I were Commander-in-Chief over there! I would address that
Oriental character which must be powerfully spoken to, in something like
the following placard, which should be vigorously translated into all native
dialects, &quot;I, the Inimitable, holding this office of mine and firmly
believing that I hold it by the permission of Heaven and not by the appointment
of Satan, have the honour to inform you Hindoo [meaning Indian] gentry that
it is my intention, with all possible avoidance of unnecessary cruelty and
with all merciful swiftness of execution, to exterminate the Race from the
face of the earth, which disfigured the earth with the late abominable atrocities&quot;.'
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Tennyson said much the same thing, the only difference
was he said it in verse. But then what can we expect of someone so culturally
myopic that he claimed 'Better 50 years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay?'
I forbear to quote the doggerel; you may find it in his Collected Poems.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Unjust Behavior by the US Towards Iraq</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When countries, or leaders, choose to oppose America, the
US acts surprised and outraged. How dare anyone challenge such a world power?a
&quot;superior&quot; country! They bawl like a big baby and throw tantrums
and taunts. This time the taunt is towards Saddam Hussein?to Iraq?and they
threaten to use force. Are they so eager for a war? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>US President Bill Clinton states that the American people
are behind him and against Saddam. Are they really, or is he just delusional?
As I recall, the American people I knew, in general, did not like the idea
of entering the Gulf War. In the end, support was gained. I guess the American
government will use the same &quot;brainwashing&quot; patriotic tools to
force the American people to once again accept something they do not really
want and what they really believe they have no business being in the middle
of. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is strange how some countries, which are supposed to
serve the will and wishes of its people as well as to benefit them, always
act in opposition of its people's wishes. How is it possible for the minority
to control the majority? Well, somehow through the use of &quot;slick&quot;
speeches and the use of the media as political trains, the people are herded
in the same direction while the opposition gets stampeded. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The American people half listen to the Iraqi dispute without
much interest in the politics and games, for they trust that America will
win in the end, as usual. Yet, they don't bother to question neither the
injustice of this situation nor the loss of sovereignty in Iraq. There has
developed a new kind of imperialism, yet who will win? The Americans? Or
is there another interested party who gains from this imperialism? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>America, for the past seven years or so, has helped to
push economic embargoes and no-fly zones on Iraq. This is a loss of sovereignty.
When will it end, or will it ever? Haven&iacute;t the people of Iraq suffered
enough? The economic sanctions do not touch the government or Saddam, but
they have put hardships and suffering on the children, women and elderly
of Iraq. The civilians have suffered too much from this inhumanity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Supposedly Iraq is still a country, yet it is divided.
This division was caused by America's suggestion of a no-fly zone in the
north and south of Iraq. Why in the north when Kuwait is in the south? Will
Iraq ever regain its rightful sovereignty? Now, Turkey's army is unjustly
fighting the Kurds in northern Iraq; if Saddam had control in the north,
surely Turkey would not be fighting there and risk war with Iraq. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Iraq has little trust in America, and it is only natural
to feel this way. America has made a personal vendetta against Saddam and
his country. Its language has been insulting and offensive?its behaviour
even worse. They barely allowed a partial lifting of economic embargoes
to cut an oil-for-food deal. Now, they've slapped more sanctions against
Iraq, as if they could do more harm. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Iraq has agreed to allow UN inspectors to look around,
but Americans are barred. If Iraq feels it is being prejudiced against itself,
then why can't it keep out certain people to protect it? A country needs
to have its own security intact. Other countries throughout the world get
to decide who can enter their countries. Besides, other UN members can easily
do the job. Yet, America wants to go to war over being barred. They want
to protest being opposed. However, America opposes others all the time.
They want to turn the world against Iraq, Iran, Libya and Cuba. It doesn't
want anyone to have equal weapons or power in the world, so they must not
even be allowed to attempt such a thing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>America goes through the world spouting such slogans as
&igrave;peace&icirc;, &igrave;save the environment&icirc; and &igrave;get
rid of dangerous weapons&icirc;, yet it does not act upon what it preaches.
Take the following for examples: America mediates all over the world like
performing in a stage show, yet where have they really accomplished solid
peace? Take, for instance, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which is not
even close to any agreement; even Bosnia is in a shaky position. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Secondly, America supports the world conference against
greenhouse gases and thinks it is a wonderful event. However, America is
doing the worst job in the whole world in bringing down its amount of gases.
It doesn't really enforce environmental measures because business takes
precedence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lastly, the former Soviet Union countries are handing over
nuclear weapons to the US, yet who is checking up on America's disposal
of its nuclear weapons? Wouldn't it be ironic if the entire world handed
over their weapons and America stood with the only weapons in the whole
world? An enormous Python like America also needs someone to watch it. Who's
watching? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The other dangerous weapons left in the world are destructive
and life-ruining landmines that injure innocent children and civilians throughout
the world. America is attending a conference against landmines, but they
state that they can't sign against their use because it would endanger their
soldiers in Asia, in particular, Korea. Double standard? What's new?? They
worry only about themselves, yet we are all humans of one race and should
care for all human lives, especially the defenseless. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In all fairness, the world must take a stand against irrational
behaviour and against flaring tempers. It has been suggested that a team
of Arabs from various countries could also come to inspect. Why not make
it a joint project? This would add to Iraq's feeling of security from those
who have injured it before. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>America's ego needs to take a rest and step aside. War
is serious business and does so much damage to both sides. Besides, &quot;children&quot;
should not be allowed to play with matches in the decision arena, especially
when throwing a temper tantrum. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Iraq and the Arabs versus the New World Order</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Between the Economic Conference of Ad-Doha, Qatar, the
stalled 'peace process' in Palestine, and the escalating crisis between
Iraq and the United States Government, are many linkages?some of which are
obvious and some of which are not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The official reason given to the public as to why most
Arab states boycotted the fourth regional conference for economic normalization
with 'Israel' has been the tenacious refusal by Netanyahu's government to
make reciprocating concessions or to honour political obligations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, Jerusalem is being feverishly Judaized to establish
facts on the ground before final status negotiations. Settlements are being
energetically expanded to absorb as much of the West Bank as possible. Previously
agreed upon withdrawals from (redeployments in) some miniscule Palestinian
territories have come to a halt with no breakthrough in sight. All this
is going on with Palestinians reeling under a continuous state of siege,
and no progress being made on the Lebanese or Syrian political fronts; Netanyahu
has pointed out more than once that Arabs adapt to the facts that 'Israel'
imposes. Yet why shouldn't he think or even publicize that so long as 'Israel'
proposes and America disposes?!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some say 'Israel' is violating the Oslo Agreement, or that
the agreement has died already and so the 'peace process' needs another
agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But if we look at the history of the Zionist strategy in
dealing with Arabs, we'll realize that it has relied on:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Building up Israeli military, political, and technological
elements of strength while destroying those same elements in Arab countries;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Depending on the support of the major Western superpower
at the time, first Britain then the U.S., for financial, diplomatic, logistical,
and military backing to achieve Zionist policy objectives;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3. Keeping the Arabs weak and divided, sometimes with the
help of friendly dictators and collaborators, and other times with sheer
violence and conspiracies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thus what's happening now in Palestine, or Iraq and Qatar
for that matter, is not a deviation from Oslo. IT IS OSLO.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oslo meant giving up more than 80% of Palestine, recognizing
&euml;Israel's&iacute; right to exist, shutting off the only Palestinian
source of negotiating strength, that being all forms of struggle against
Zionists, and opening up Arab markets and resources for the taking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, Iraq, Libya and Sudan must stay under siege while
economic normalization proceeds with 'Israel'. That is the spirit, if not
the letter, of Oslo. And further progress in the so-called Middle East 'peace
process' hinges upon further weakening (and possibly breaking up) Syria,
Iraq, Egypt, and even Iran. The balance of power must be tilted further
in &euml;Israel's&iacute; favour so that the next step in the 'peace process'
would make the Oslo Agreement look, even to those who rejected it, like
an unobtainable fantasy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Iraq could have bent over backwards for the U.S. Government
and handed over the proverbial kitchen sink to UNSCOM but all to no avail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet this time the confrontation is different in many ways;
the main difference is that Iraq is not in Kuwait. Arab regimes and people
in general saw clearly that seven years of Iraq&iacute;s compliance with
UNSCOM bore no fruit in terms of lifting the sanctions. Coupled with new
sanctions on Sudan and tightening the lid on Libya against the wishes of
the Arab League, the objectives are blatantly political, anti-Arab, and
pro-Israeli. The participation of the U.S. in naval exercises with 'Israel'
and Turkey in front of the Syrian shore just overexposed an already scandalous
adoption of Zionism as American foreign policy. After about 1.4 million
dead civilians, the Iraqi people themselves, even political exiles in Syria,
realized that Saddam is just the excuse, and that the real target is Iraq
itself, as well as Libya, Syria, Sudan, Palestine and wherever Arab oil
can be found. This time even Kuwait and Saudi Arabia don't seem as enthusiastic
to participate in an &igrave;allied&icirc; movement, and many previously
pliant Arab regimes have begun to realize too that sanctions are only a
method of punishment for disobeying the orders of Washington and Tel Aviv.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This was the background of the Iraqi move to expel American
inspectors from UNSCOM, and as far as that goes, it was a brilliant one,
but only for those who realize that we have nothing to lose, and that there's
no salvation but in resisting injustice.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Mandela: a Lesson in American Hypocrisy</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the 27 years that Nelson Mandela sat hunched down
in a South African prison cell?a victim of the country's Apartheid policies?Americans
did a little more than prohibit the sale of South African gold krugerrands.
They also paid lip-service, criticizing South African discrimination, mainly
in response to the growing voice of America's own discriminated African-American
population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many countries, including Israel, were leaders in importing
South African goods and exporting their own merchandise to South African
markets, all the while Mandela sat in jail, expected by his captors to &quot;rot&quot;
and &quot;die&quot; in his prison cell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>South Africa meant business, and even during his final
years in jail, no one here ever believed that Mandela would rise to not
only become South Africa's new president, but also to bring about the end
of Apartheid. He was released from prison in 1990 and became president in
1994.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the other hand, from a tent in the middle of a north
African desert, Moammar Qadhafi repeatedly denounced South African Apartheid,
as he did the racism of Zionism and the discrimination of the Industrialized
West against the emerging Third World.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1988, an American Pan Am passenger jet was sabotaged
over Lockerbie, Scotland, and American intelligence immediately blamed the
bombing on Qadhafi. Although evidence later indicated that the Libyans were
not involved, the Americans refused to abandon a politically-correct posture
that has made Qadhafi and a handful of other Arab leaders scapegoats for
their own international missteps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Later, the American warplanes, on orders from President
Reagan, bombed Qadhafi's homes. Among the dead was Qadhafi's young daughter,
Hana.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Under pressure from the United States to punish Libya for
failing to turn over two alleged suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, the
United Nations imposed trade sanctions on Libya in 1992, this despite the
fact that the United States remains one of the top countries that has failed
to pay its share of UN subsidies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And when the United States learned that Mandela planned
to visit Libya recently, it expressed outrage and denounced the visit in
whispering terms, obviously sensitive to its own hypocrisy surrounding Mandela,
Libya and the Third World.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Standing in front of the bombed-out home where Hana Qadhafi
was murdered by an air attack that Qadhafi called an act of &quot;terrorism&quot;,
Mandela denounced the UN embargo and criticized the United States in the
harshest of terms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Those who object to my visiting Libya have no morals,
and I will not join them because I have morals,&quot; Mandela proclaimed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Qadhafi is my friend. He helped us at a time when
we were alone. And the ones who are (trying) to stop us from coming here
were helping our enemies at that time.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mandela, a leader of the African continent, called for
an end to the embargo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Certainly the visit of Mandela to Tripoli has cast doubts
on the reality of the American-inspired, UN-imposed embargo on the Arab
people of Libya.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The United States demand for the return of the two Libyans
suspected of bombing the Pan Am jet, killing 270 Americans, is being weighed
by the International Court of Justice at the Hague.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the other hand, the Americans are silent about their
own actions, such as when a gung-ho US Navy Admiral ordered the downing
of Airbus 655 during tensions in the Persian Gulf. 290 Muslims travelling
from Bandar Abbas, Iran to Dubai, United Arab Emirates were killed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The US never apologized for this act of barbarism by one
of its senior officers, nor were any of the families compensated, as were
families of victims who died at Lockerbie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An A&amp;E (Arts &amp; Entertainment) cable TV special
detailed the inconsistencies in the Admiral's explanation of his orders
to shoot down the plane, and clearly the downing of Airbus 655 was intended
as a severe warning to the Iranians who were running ships through a US
blockade.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Little is written about this act of terrorism, and no one
in the United States has asked the UN to embargo United States products.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It's that kind of hypocrisy that Mandela recognized during
his 27 years sitting in a South African Apartheid prison. Maybe that's why
he has to look twice when the United States points an accusatory finger
toward Third World nations, and why he is visiting Libya, the victim of
an American-inspired double standard.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The US Neoconservative Agenda and West Asia</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Vijay Prashad*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Norman Podhoretz, one of the leading US neoconservatives,
published an article in Commentary (vol. 91, No. 4, April 1991) entitled
&quot;In Israel, With Scuds and Patriots.&quot; Podhoretz longed for a US
victory over Iraq since, he argued, it would bring &quot;a new surge of
confidence in America?in American technology, so triumphantly on display
in our planes and their smart munitions; in American wisdom and courage,
so vividly manifest in the very act of going to war.....Goodbye to the decline-of-America
theories,&quot; he continued, &quot;Goodbye, at long last, to Vietnam.&quot;
Podhoretz enunciated the high exuberance of much of the US establishment,
not just the Zionist branch, but also the Right wing for whom the memory
of Vietnam needed to be exorcised. Among this sector of the US power elite,
there was little of the ethical will demonstrated within (and outside) Israel
by the anti-Zionist Left. This article, written at a time of increased US
sabre-rattling against Iraq owing to a stand-off over UN inspections, will
offer a brief analysis of the neoconservative position on Israel, West Asia
and the quest of the struggling masses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Irving Kristol, the grandfather of the New Right, made
it very clear on 15 April 1991 (&quot;Tongue-tied in Washington,&quot; Wall
Street Journal) that the US intervened in the Gulf &quot;to prevent a belligerent,
anti-Western tyrant from dominating that oil-rich area. It was (and is)
in our national interest that this not happen.&quot; Without a doubt, the
Gulf War (1991) and the US bombing of Iraq (September 1996) occurred to
preserve US dominance over oil. The US did not only want to preserve the
right of US oil monopolies to dominate the trade, but it also wanted to
demonstrate US strength to Japan and Germany. The fate of the Iraqis did
not enter into the equation. For this reason, the hypocritical attitude
of the neoconservatives needs to be exposed. Many, such as Kristol and Podhoretz
wrote openly of the motivations of oil and power. Simultaneously, they wrote
of the need for the US to provide moral leadership in the world. A. M. Rosenthal
(&quot;The Fear of Morality&quot;, New York Times, 16 April 1991) longed
for an entry of morals into US foreign policy. &quot;Just see where realpolitik
has gotten us in the Mideast,&quot; he wrote, &quot;Iran in the hands of
religious fanatics, Syria and Libya ruled under terrorist fascism, Saddam
Hussein still in power, marauding?and a million Iraqi refugees clawing for
food, crying our their hunger and betrayal.&quot; But Irving Kristol was
more honest: the war was about oil and power, and &quot;no civilized person
in his right mind wants to govern Iraq.&quot; Nevertheless, the neoconservative
agenda was to place the reason of power within a moral framework so that
the general public within the US (but elsewhere) could take comfort from
the character of the leadership offered by the US.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The attempt to be &quot;moral,&quot; however, fails horribly
when applied to the dispossessed peoples. Of the &quot;unfortunate Kurds,&quot;
Irving Kristol noted that &quot;it is their bad luck that their 20 million
are divided among Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran and the Soviet Union, none of
which wishes to encourage the idea that a united 'Kurdistan' could ever
come into existence.&quot; Since, for Kristol, these &quot;ethnic problems&quot;
are intractable, the US should not get involved and &quot;so there it is.&quot;
Of the Palestinians, Kristol was sure that a settlement was unnecessary
(and Oslo changed nothing for most of the neoconservatives). &quot;A Palestinian
state in Gaza would be nothing more than an armed camp for intransigent
irredentists who would be at permanent war with Israel,&quot; Kristol wrote
in 1989.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Why should Israel agree to any such scenario? It
won't, since it would only end up having to occupy Gaza all over again&quot;
(&quot;Who Needs Peace in the Middle East,&quot; Wall Street Journal, 21
June 1989). To those Palestinians who still dream of their homes and land
and who have passed on these memories to their children, Kristol was brutal.
&quot;The million or so Palestinian refugees?by now mainly children and
grandchildren of the original refugees?did not come from the West Bank,
have no family connections on the West Bank, and have no memories of the
West Bank.&quot; These Palestinians, in words similar to Golda Meir, have
no right to belong, since what they have doesn't exist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An article such as this is intended to do only one thing:
to reveal to the reader the depth of opposition to justice within the US
establishment. Those who want to clutch at straws and hope that Clinton
or Albright or others will be so repulsed by Netanyahu and will push for
justice are fundamentally misguided. These US politicians may dislike Bibi,
but they are still committed to a policy that has as its main priority US
interests and is unwilling to recognize the human rights of those it does
not deem to be people. The Kurds became &quot;people&quot; so that the US
might launch an ideological campaign against Baghdad. When that did not
bear fruit, the Kurds returned to their status as &quot;unpeople.&quot;
The Palestinians are in the very same boat. The arc of history bends towards
justice, but the active work of making it so will have to come from those
whose commitment to self-determination is beyond the interests of US-based
multinationals and the general dynamic of imperialism.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hittin Before 1948</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village was located on the banks of a small wadi, at
the northern foot of Mount Hittin. Historically, the village was strategically
and commercially significant because it dominated the Plain of Hittin. The
plain opened onto the coastal lowlands of Lake Tiberias, to the east, and
to the west was linked to the plains of lower Galilee through mountain passes
(see photos). These plains, with their east-west passages, had served as
routes for commercial caravans and military invasions thro.ughout the ages.
The village may have been built over the Canaanite town of Siddim or Ziddim
(Joshua 19:35), which in the third century B.C. acquired the Hebrew narne
Kefar Hattin (&quot;village of grain&quot;). It was known by the name Kfar
Hittaya in the Roman period and served as a rabbinical seat in the fourth
century. The Plain of Hittin was the site of the famous battle of Hittin
(1187), in which Salah al-Din alAyyubi (Saladin) defeated the Crusaders'
armies, thereby securing the entire Galilee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hittin also was the place where numerous prominent figures
in the early Islamic period were born or buried. Their names were linked
to the village by a number of early Arab and Muslim geographers and chroniclers,
including Yaqut alHamawi (d. 1228) and al-Ansari al-Dimashqi (d. 1327),
who himself was called the Shaykh of Hittin. 'Ali al-Dawadari, the writer,
Qur'anic exegetist, and calligrapher died in the village in 1302. [D 6/2:390-92;
al-Khalidi 1968:119-201 In 1596, Hittin was a village in the nahiya of Tiberias
(lfwa' of Safad) with a population of 605. It paid taxes on a number of
crops, including wheat, barley, and olives, as well as on other types of
produce, such as goats and beehives. lHut. and Abd.:190l In the early nineteenth
century, the Swiss traveler Burekhardt described it as a small village whose
houses were built of stone. lBurekhardt 1822:250] In the late nineteenth
century, Hittin was circled by fruit and olive trees; the village's 400
residents cultivated part of the surrounding plain. [SWP (1881) 1:3601</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The modern village layout was triangular in shape. Its
streets were level and straight due to the flatness of the site. The village
center, located in the northwest, included a small market, an elementary
school (established around 1897 under Ottoman rule) and a mosque for the
entirely Muslim population. Religious landmarks in the village area included
the shrine of the prophet (nabi) Shuiayb on the southwestern outskirts of
Hittin. This shrine was especially sacred to people of the Druze faith,
who made a pilgrimage to the site each April. The shrine had several rooms
for visitors and a prayer hall that was believed to house the tomb and footprint
of the prophet Shu'ayb. A spring near the shrine provided the visitors with
drinking water.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The land was well-endowed with good soil and enjoyed plentiful
rain and ground water, especially in the northern part of the plain, where
there was a group of springs and wells. Combined with the moderate weather,
these attributes led to the development of a successful agricultural economy.
Most villagers engaged in agriculture, which was based on grain and fruits,
including olives. In 1944 a total of 10,253 dunums was planted in cereals;
1,936 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards. The village was constructed
over the archaeological remains of earlier settlements; these remains were
scattered throughout the village. There were also a number of khirbas in
the vicinity.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The villagers' first direct experience of the war was on
9 June 1948, when an Israeli attack on nearby Lubya was repulsed just before
the beginning of the first truce. Interviewed some twenty-five years later,
villagers said that as the Israeli armored unit was retreating eastwards,
the militiamen of Hittin opened fire on the vehicles from their positions
overlooking the Nazareth-Tiberias highway. After forcing the Israeli unit
to retreat further, most of the militiamen returned to the village to join
in the funeral procession of one of their fallen comrades. The lookouts
who remained at the &quot;Horns of Hittin&quot;-the two high hills separated
by a valley that are a landmark of the ancient battlefield-soon spotted
an armored unit accompanied by infantry advancing towards the village from
the direction of the Jewish settlement of Mitzpa. One of the participants
described the subsequent developments to Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal:
&quot;We joined our lookouts on the Horns of Hittin. Numerically, we were
fewer; however, our positions overlooked theirs... we saw every move they
made. As they advanced towards us. . . we fought them fiercely for more
than four hours and forced them to halt. A few of us went down the mountain
and dug in behind the rocks; when they opened fire, the Jews thought that
they were trapped and decided to retreat.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The next attack was mounted by the Sheva' (Seventh) Brigade
after the first truce ended, during Operation Dekel (see 'Amqa, Acre District).
Villagers told Nazzal that when Nazareth fell (on 16 July), some twenty-five
to thirty Arab Liberation Army soldiers stationed at Hittin began to withdraw.
Most villagers left on the night of 16-17 July, taking refuge in Salama,
an area between Dayr Hanna and alMughar. One of the militiamen who stayed
behind later recounted what happened that night:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We remained at the Horns of Hittin until the last minute.
We saw the Jewish armoured unit advancing ... we were too few and had too
limited a supply of ammunition to withstand the attack.... During the first
Jewish attack, many of the villagers used up all the ammunition they had....
We retreated to the village and with a few remaining villagers, we ned north.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shortly after the village was taken, the second truce went
into effect. In the next few days, five men returned to assess the possiblity
of retaking the village, but were fired upon by Israeli soldiers. At least
one person managed to return and escort his parents out. The villagers also
repolted that they remained on the village outskirts for a month, waiting
for a chance to return. Eventually, they headed for Lebanon. [M:xv, 200-203;
N:83-85; see T:251-52l</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Settlements on Village Lands</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel established the settlement of Arbel (196246) to
the north of the village site in 1949. Kefar Zetim (193246) was established
one year later, to the northeast. Both are on village land. Kefar Chittim
(197245), founded in 1936 to the east of the village, and Mitzpa (197243),
founded in 1908 to the east, are close to the village site, but they are
not on village land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Village Today</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The site is overgrown with grass, and heaps of stones are
scattered across it. Aquatic plants grow in the shallow streams that run
past it. The mosque is deserted; its minaret is intact but its arches are
crumbling (see photos). Mulberry, fig, and eucalyptus trees, as well as
cactuses, grow on the site. The surrounding lands of the plain are cultivated,
while the mountainous lands are used as grazing areas. The shrine of alNabi
Shu'ayb, on the slope of a hill near the village, still stands as a holy
place for Druze pilgrims.</FONT></P>
