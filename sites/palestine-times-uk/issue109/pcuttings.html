    Angeles Times, 29 June 2000</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem-</b> Israeli and Palestinian leaders told Secretary of State
    Madeleine Albright on Wednesday that they are far from reaching a deal to settle their
    decades-old conflict but promised to attend a summit if President Clinton calls one. </p>
    <font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>The
    ambiguous end to Albright's third trip to the Middle East in a month seemed to rule out
    the sort of early July extravaganza that Clinton clearly wants--and Albright was sent to
    the region to set up. But it left open the possibility of a high-stakes meeting involving
    the three leaders later in the year. </p>
    <font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>By
    agreeing to attend a summit if it is called, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
    Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat put unexpected pressure on Clinton. The U.S.
    president has sought to play the role of mediator but clearly has been uncomfortable with
    suggestions that he could or should dictate an outcome. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Everyone seems to be making threats these days. <font color="#000000">Palestin</font>ians are threatening Israelis, Israelis are threatening
    Arabs, Jews are threatening Jews, West Bank settlers are threatening the life of Prime
    Minister Ehud Barak. In the past, when there were tough negotiations with the Egyptians,
    warnings were issued. But there never were any threats comparable to those we are hearing
    now. The recent talks with the Syrians were also tough, but both sides guarded their
    tongues. Despite his inflexible positions, the late Syrian President Hafez Assad carefully
    refrained from making any threats.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet we now see a developing &quot;culture of threats&quot; where each side
    hears only the threats being made by the other side. When Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said
    the Israel Defense Forces might use tanks and planes should there be an eruption of <font color="#000000">Palestin</font>ian violence in the territories, the <font color="#000000">Palestin</font>ians
    interpreted that as a vulgar threat. <strong>(from an article by By Ze'ev Schiff)</strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A written declaration to that effect, on official Chief Rabbinate

    delegation to an interfaith meeting with Muslim and Christian <font color="#000000">Palestin</font>ians

    establishment of an interfaith council that would be responsible foe all the holy places

    Barak is reportedly ready to make to the Palestinians. But the most important
    defector--Shas, the second-largest party in the coalition--was seeking guarantees for its
    network of religious schools and radio stations.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Hafez Assad is dead, and he did not sign,&quot; read the headline in
    Al-Nahar, Lebanon's leading Arabic-language newspaper, a day after the Syrian leader
    suffered a fatal heart attack on June 10. Indeed, Assad never did sign a peace treaty with
    his Israeli enemies, a move that earned him much respect in the Arab world, at least among
    those who regard a settlement as tantamount to surrender. </p>
    <font SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Esteem, however, is
    different than political influence. It was Assad's fate to die even as his once-vaunted
    Lebanon policy came under considerable stress. When Israeli forces withdrew unilaterally
    from southern Lebanon, Syria was denied the military leverage over Israel that it enjoyed
    through its support of Hezbollah, and, in the process, it became more difficult for Assad
    or his successor to negotiate an acceptable deal on the Golan Heights. </p>
