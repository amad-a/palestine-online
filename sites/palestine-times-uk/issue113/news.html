intifada despite summit blues</font></b></h3>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unlike Yasser Arafat, who praised the outcome of the recent Arab summit in
Cairo, the vast bulk of Palestinians voiced profound disappointment and even a modicum of
indignation at the indecisive decisions and recommendations of the summit, accusing the
Arab Heads of State of caving in to American pressure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Arab leaders are telling us to go and fight our battle alone,&#148;
remarked one columnist in the Palestinian daily, <i>al-Ayyam</i>, on 23 October. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The disappointment is understandable. Many ordinary Palestinians, indeed
the Arab masses, had hoped the summit would take strong decisions reflecting or at least
echoing the current mood in the Arab world which strongly favours a tough stance against
Israel in light of continued Israeli insolence, pugnacity and genocidal repression of the
Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These decisions are far below our expectations; we expected Arab
leaders to take practical steps to convince Israel that the Palestinians are not alone in
facing the Israeli war machine,&#148; said Hisham Abdul Razzaq, who is in charge of the
prisoners&#146; portfolio in the PA administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Razzaq welcomed the summit decision to help the Palestinians
financially, which he said would bolster their steadfastness and enable them to withstand
Israeli repression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, he made unmistakably clear that financial assistance to the
Palestinians was not and ought not to be an alternative to putting up a strong collective
Arab response to Israeli intransigence and arrogance of power.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Arab leaders should have adopted clear decisions as to what they
would do in case Israel flew in the face of all these decisions.&#148; (Israel did fly in
the face of the summit decisions by declaring a &#147;time-out&#148; from the peace
process.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">High-ranking PA officials, such as Nabil Sha&#146;ath, Sa&#146;eb Ureikat
and Yasser Abed Rabbo preferred to be diplomatic in their appraisal of the summit outcome.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It is true that the decisions of the summit did not rise up to the
level of our sacrifices, nevertheless, the summit sent an unequivocal message to Israel
that the Palestinians are not alone and that the Arab world will never accept anything
less than total Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967 in accordance
with UN resolutions 242 and 332,&#148; said Abed Rabbo during an interview with the Qatari
television station, al-Jazeera.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For their part, Hamas and other Islamist parties denounced the summit as
&#147;feeble , and reflecting the wide chasm between the Arab leaders and the Arab
masses.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin echoed the
widespread dissatisfaction with the summit&#146;s &#147;flimsy decisions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These decisions disappointed Arabs and Muslims in Palestine and
around the world who were looking forward to seeing a strong Arab stance against Israeli
aggression,&#148; said Yassin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, Yassin vowed, as did all other Palestinian leaders from
across the political spectrum, that the weak decisions of the summit will have little
impact on the intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The intifada will continue regardless of summit decisions.&#148; He
added, with a smile, that &#147;we don&#146;t count much on Arab regimes; we count on the
Arab and Muslim masses.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghoshe accused the summit participants of
&#147;pouring very cold water on the feelings of the entire Arab nation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;If these rivers of blood don&#146;t move our leaders, what would
move them?&#148; asked Ghoshe bitterly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Islamist accused Arab leaders of acting at the United States&#146;
beck and call, and of &#147;completely ignoring the feelings of their people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We must realize by now that most, if not all Arab leaders, are
answerable to a distant master in the Western hemisphere called the White House&#133;they
are not responsible to their masses&#133;hence we can&#146;t expect them to adopt
decisions that would upset the United States,&#148; said Sheikh Nayef Rajoub, a popular
Islamist preacher in the Hebron area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The leaders find themselves between the American hammer and their
peoples&#146; anvil; they chose to cower before the Americans&#133;as they always
did.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, some Palestinians gave the summit some credit.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Yes, it was not up to our aspirations, but something is better than
nothing,&#148; said Palestinian writer Tawfiq Abu Baker.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that the test now was to translate the decisions and
recommendations of the summit into political action.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Baker&#146;s optimistic appraisal of the summit has already gained
some vindication.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Morocco and Tunisia have already decided to sever ties with Israel, and
Qatar, too, is expected to follow suit. In addition, a whole host of Palestinian and Arab
non-governmental organizations are also severing all ties and contacts with equivalent
Israeli bodies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the summit did demonstrate, probably for the first
time, that Arab leaders could not continue to disregard public opinion at home, a
significant and positive trend that should be allowed to grow. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">&#147;They shoot-to kill&#148;</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150;PT</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>For the fourth consecutive week, the Israeli army kept up its bloody
repression of unarmed Palestinian protesters desperately hoping to deliver their people
from the shackles of the brutal Israeli occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And as they did in the three previous weeks, crack Israeli soldiers, using
lethal and state-of-the-art death equipment, continued to adopt a shoot-to-kill approach
toward Palestinian demonstrators, apparently in fulfilment of clear instructions to that
effect from the Israeli government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This trigger-happy approach resulted in the death of at least another 20
Palestinians, including 4 children below the age of 14. Furthermore, as many as 700
protesters and demonstrators, as well as innocent bystanders, were injured, mostly by
gunfire, as the use of rubber-coated steel bullets gave way to the use of the more lethal
steel bullets fired from M-16 rifles and a variety of heavier sub-machine guns used in
war. In light, many of the injured, around 50, sustained serious-to-critical wounds, and
five, including two children, were pronounced clinically dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With these casualty figures, which keep growing by the hour, the death
toll of Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers and also by marauding Jewish settlers has,
as of now, reached over 146, with the wounded topping the 5,000 figure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fiercest &#147;confrontations&#148; between the Israeli army and
stone-throwing Palestinians this week took place on Friday, 20 October, dubbed by the
Palestinian daily newspaper, <i>al-Ayyam</i>, as the fourth &#147;Red Friday.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On that day, the Israeli army used numerous helicopter gunships to strafe
several Palestinian population centres in the regions of Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem and
Hebron. Concomitantly, Israeli soldiers and specially-trained sharpshooters taking
positions at strategic elevations or on the rooftops of multi-storey buildings continued
to hunt down Palestinian protesters gathering along the so-called &#147;friction
lines&#148; just outside PA-controlled towns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By nightfall, there were 9 Palestinians dead and 370 injured. Three of the
injured succumbed later to their injuries. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Beit Jala, a small, predominantly Christian town near Bethlehem,
several buildings, including a theatre hall, a carpentry and youth centre, sustained
direct hits when Israeli tanks entrenched outside the nearby Jewish settlement Gilo
shelled the town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel said the bombardment was in retaliation for the firing from Beit
Jala of several projectiles toward Gilo, which Israeli sources said slightly injured a
settler and caused minor damage to three windows.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Beit Jala was bombarded twice again on 22 and 23 October, causing more
serious injuries and inflicting heavier damage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said an artillery shell fired from the direction of
Gilo hit an ambulance which was racing to take the injured to hospital. The three
paramedics inside the ambulance, in addition to the driver, were injured, one seriously. A
miracle seemed to have saved their lives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 22 October, the Palestinian haemorrhage continued unabated, as Israeli
soldiers stepped up their draconian repression of Palestinian protests. Five Palestinians
were killed and over 150 injured throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two of the injured, including a 13-year-old child, later died of their
wounds. Another four Palestinians were killed on the subsequent day, Monday, 23 October.
One of the four fatalities was a 52-year-old woman from a village near Tulkarem, in the
northern part of the West Bank, who fell on her head as she was being pursued by an
Israeli soldier. The woman reportedly had leukemia.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In downtown Hebron, Israeli soldiers and settlers continued to fire
volleys of heavy machine-gun rounds on Palestinian neighbourhoods adjacent to or
overlooking the Old Town, which is still under full Israeli army military control. And,
very often, artillery shells were also fired, mostly randomly, on Palestinian
neighbourhoods ostensibly to terrorize the Palestinians and, in the words of an Israeli
officer, to &#147;demonstrate to them that we are strong and have the upper hand.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 October, the Israeli army demonstrated once again its &#147;upper
hand&#148; when it shelled the &#147;Abu Sneineh neighbourhood&#148; with heavy
machine-guns. One 500 millimetre bullet pierced the forehead of 63-year-old Abdulaziz Abu
Sneineh and exited from the back of his head. He died immediately. His three children were
also injured. Abu Sneineh was trying to evacuate his family to a safer place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Israeli government and army continued to give the extremely
racist and trigger-happy Jewish settlers free rein to attack, murder and terrorize
unprotected and unarmed Palestinian villagers throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This week, the settlers killed another Palestinian farmer, who was picking
olives near Tulkarem, bringing the number of Palestinians murdered, often in a gruesome
manner, to ten.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 October, two Jewish settlers from the settlement of Itamar near
Nablus shot dead 28-year-old Farid Nasasrah, while picking olives in his orchard at the
nearby village of Beit Fureik.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two settlers, Yaron Degani, 40, and Gad Tena, 48, initially confessed
to having killed Nasasrah, claiming they did so in &#147;self-defence&#148; since they saw
him &#147;walking in the direction of the settlement.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The cold-blooded murder took place in full view of scores of Palestinian
farmers, out in their fields for the olive-picking season.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, Israeli police set the two killers free on 21 October, citing
&#147;insufficient evidence proving that a murder has taken place.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Shots were fired,&#148; said Israeli Police commander of the Nablus
area Rafi Peled, claiming that &#147;there is no objective proof of a body. As it stands,
all we have are rumours&#133;.we only know of the victim&#146;s death from the
television.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian police chief in Nablus, Colonel Feras Yousef, described
Peled&#146;s remarks as &#147;nefarious lies coming from racist blood-suckers who think
that non-Jews are animals whose lives are worthless.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yousef stressed that he personally handed the Israeli police all the
details surrounding the murder of Nasasrah, including the forensic reports and testimonies
by witnesses. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They know quite well what happened; they only want to find some
excuses to free their murderers.&#148;</p>

act like Gestapo in Hebron</font></b></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the fourth consecutive week, a hermetic curfew has been imposed on
more than 20,000 Palestinian civilians living in Hebron&#146;s old town, classified as
(H-2) by the &#147;Hebron protocol&#148; reached by Israel and the Palestinian Authority
in 1996.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In practical terms, the curfew means that everybody, including women and
children, must stay indoors, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in case a citizen ventures out, even for an emergency, he or she could
be shot dead on the spot &#147;for violating the curfew&#148; and &#147;obstructing the
function of the Israeli Defence Force.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, several Palestinians, including children, had been shot dead for
merely stepping out of their houses during curfews. The people of Hebron know all too well
what it means to get out of the home during a curfew.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron is no stranger to Israeli curfews. In 1994, following the Ibrahimi
Mosque massacre carried out by an American-Jewish settler, known as Baruch Goldstein,
whereby 29 Palestinian worshipers were murdered while praying at the Mosque at dawn, the
Israeli occupation authorities actually punished the victims (the people of Hebron) by
imposing a 60-day curfew, which ruined the town&#146;s economy and caused a collective
claustrophobia among the town&#146;s 160,000 inhabitants. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Look, the Jews don&#146;t understand the elementary principles of
justice&#133;they always protect the murderer and punish the victim,&#148; said Husni
Kubabji, an elderly citizen of the old town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We are waiting until the Almighty intervenes.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear why the 20,000-strong Palestinian inhabitants of
Hebron&#146;s old town were confined to their homes for that long.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli occupation authorities cite &#147;security&#148; as the main
reason for maintaining the curfew, a mantra whose intonation justifies the sustained
torment of the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;A curfew is a slow death&#133;.we are all facing overwhelming stress
as a result of this brutal behaviour&#133;.I hope the world will force Israel to treat us
with some humanity,&#148; said Ahmed Sharabati, a 50-year-old shopkeeper, with frustration
and despair clear in the tone of his voice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He adds with resignation, &#147;What can we do&#133;.we just wait until
they lift the curfew&#133;we don&#146;t know when they will.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Dr. Abdul Aziz Shuqir, Head of the Princess Alya hospital in
Hebron, the situation in the old town is &#147;extremely dire.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Look, they are keeping 20,000 people inside their homes for 27 days
now&#133;.even animals aren&#146;t treated as such&#133;.this is at a time when Jewish
settlers wander about freely in the city&#133;looking for a stray Arab to kill him.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hashem Abul Nabi Natshe, head of Hebron&#146;s Chamber of Commerce,
estimated that Hebron loses $3 million a day as a result of the curfew and the siege being
enforced on it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Natshe puts the total loss of the entire Palestinian economy at $20
million a day &#147;in addition to the high casualty figures we sustain.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, Jewish settlers often go on the rampage in Hebron, using very
much the same rituals used by the Gestapo and the Nazi SS against the Jews during the
Second World War.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They behave like wild mad dogs&#133;they shoot at Arab houses and
windows, they break the windshields of our cars, they smash and vandalize our property in
full view of Israeli soldiers who look on nonchalantly&#133;last week, they re-enacted
several Kristallnachts at Tel Rumeida, (the night of broken glass&#133;referring to the
acts of vandalism by Nazi youths against Jewish property in Germany and Austria in
November, 1939),&#148; said Dr. Taysir Zahdeh, who bore more than his share of this
&#147;Ath&#146;ab&#148; or &#147;torment.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They think they can break our will by adopting these Nazi-like
tactics against us&#133;but they are mistaken&#133;we will not leave our homeland no
matter what&#133;we withstood 33 years of their holocaust against us, and we can withstand
more torment&#133;but in the end, they will be consumed by their own evil.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Interview with chief of Hamas political bureau</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">Khalid Misha&#146;al: Resistance will always
unite us</font></b><font SIZE="2"></h3>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The head of Hamas political bureau, Khalid Misha&#146;al has in recent
weeks visited Iran and Syria to seek support for the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Considered a serious threat by Israel, in September 1997 he survived an
attempt on his life by the Israeli Mossad in Jordan. In 1999, he was deported from Jordan
(where Hamas headquarters were located) to Qatar along with other prominent members of the
organization. The vulnerable Jordanian regime carried out the deportation under Israeli
and American pressure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Misha&#146;al was interviewed on 18 October by Sheriene Baha&#146;a of the
Egyptian daily, <i>al-Ahram</i>. The following are excerpts of what transpired.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: The first condition on the six-point list Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak brought to the Sharm el-Sheikh summit was the arrest of
&#147;extremists&#148; from the Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements who were released last
week. How do you view this condition? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: It is quite ironic that when the idea of the Sharm el-Sheikh
summit was first introduced, Arab and Palestinian demands topped the agenda. However, when
the summit began, Barak was the only one putting conditions on the table. Heading his list
of six conditions were the arrest of the released Hamas and Islamic Jihad figures. For its
part, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has already responded to this demand by detaining
approximately 30 Hamas and Jihad figures. It is really a tragedy to see inter-Palestinian
relations exposed to Israeli and Zionist blackmail. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, this sacred Intifada was a good portent because it united the
Palestinians, bringing about a long hoped-for national unity. All factions are now engaged
in a united battle against our Zionist enemy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As we have reiterated in the past, popular resistance will always unite
the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank with those outside the territories. In
contrast, the choice of &#147;peace&#148;, which is a dead-end option, divides
Palestinians. The Sharm el-Sheikh summit, which was totally rejected by most Palestinians,
is a case in point. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What do you expect from the Arab summit scheduled for next week? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The Arab summit must recognize the serious implications of the
Intifada and comprehend the significance of the popular reaction [to the Intifada and the
summit] in the Arab world in recent days. Arab governments should use the vast potential
of their own people who are willing to make sacrifices if mobilized for such a great
cause. [The protection of] Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa [mosque] and confronting the Zionist enemy
are the greatest of all causes. Hence, the Arab summit should meet the demands of its own
people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Intifada is a turning-point marking the end of one phase and the
beginning of another. This current phase requires that Arab governments develop a new
strategy. The appropriate strategy is simple, but serious, popular resistance must be
unleashed. If war by formal armed forces is subject to the balance of power, which is
currently unfavourable to the Arabs, a peoples&#146; war is not. The Arabs would
definitely outdo the Zionist enemy in popular resistance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Consequently, I think the Arab summit should declare support for the holy
Intifada and allow the resistance movement to take its course. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, summit participants should sever all diplomatic ties with
Israel, expelling its representatives from Arab lands. Arab countries should embark on a
total boycott of Israeli products and their governments must reject American and Israeli
hegemony. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Barak has called for a national unity government, which would
include [hard-line Likud leader Ariel] Sharon, in what Israelis are calling &#147;a
government of war.&#148; Why are Palestinians not calling for their own national unity
government that would include the Palestinian opposition? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Of course, Hamas would welcome such an agreement [among Palestinian
political forces]. We believe in the importance of national unity in confronting the
Israelis. But this is not the responsibility of Hamas alone. The PA must focus on
buttressing national unity, but in doing so, it needs to recognize certain conditions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To show that it is truly committed to national unity, the PA should adopt
a programme that responds to the needs and priorities of the people. This is a programme
of resistance and confrontation. There is no unity based on the peace process or
negotiations. Such a choice is controversial and fragments Palestinian society as
demonstrated during the past seven years since Oslo. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another condition is ending all security arrangements with the enemy. It
is ridiculous that the PA, which has coordinated with our enemy in recent years, should be
told by Barak at Sharm el-Sheikh that this coordination must be effective. In fact,
security cooperation was never halted, it has only decreased slightly in times of tension,
but it never stopped. Thus, security arrangements that chase our people back to prison are
blows to the concept of national unity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Added to these conditions, imprisoned members of Hamas and Jihad must be
released because national unity cannot be established while figures from the political and
military wings of these organizations are in Palestinian jails. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the recent release of members of Hamas and Jihad was not owing to
a decision by the PA. These prisoners were released by a popular action that exploited
Barak&#146;s threats to attack PA headquarters which led Palestinian forces to withdraw
from the area where the prisoners were placed. Palestinian people, taking the opportunity
this afforded, opened by force the gates of prisons in Nablus and Gaza, thus freeing Hamas
and Jihad members who were jailed for no valid reason. Unfortunately, the PA, under
pressure from the U.S., Israel and Britain has detained about 30 of the freed prisoners
and is now pursuing the others. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Palestinian officials have attributed the arrest of recently
released Hamas members to acts of violence against Palestinian targets rather than Israeli
ones. Is this what happened? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, this is not true. Hamas has actually forbidden the use of force
against Palestinians and declared that its military force will be directed only at Israel.
Last week, there was a huge march in Gaza of 60,000 Palestinians representing various
groups. When they passed establishments serving alcohol, demonstrators set them on fire.
This was not a decision by Hamas; such acts were spontaneous, although we assume that
there were elements that infiltrated the march to incite demonstrators so as to give the
PA a pretext under which to arrest Hamas members once again. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the arrival of the PA in Gaza in 1994, these immoral establishments
began to proliferate in the Palestinian territories, especially in Gaza. However, Hamas
did not interfere by closing or burning these places. It is not part of our strategy to
attack such places. If Hamas tolerated the security measures adopted by the PA against
Hamas members and did not respond to such acts which were actually instigated by our
Zionist enemy, why would we now use force to attack such places? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: An announcement by a leading Hamas figure in Gaza said that Hamas
is planning to resume suicide attacks against Israeli targets. Is this true? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Hamas will never give up the resistance. What is changing are
circumstances on the ground. Security arrangements between the Israelis and the PA, which
are under the supervision of the CIA, have all increased obstacles faced by the mujahidin
[freedom fighters]. However, our strategy will never change; resistance is a legitimate
right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli helicopter gunships and gunboats bombed and destroyed several
Palestinian facilities and buildings in Ramallah and the Gaza Strip on 14 October, as a
reprisal for the killing by angry Palestinians of two undercover Israeli soldiers who
apparently sought to assassinate Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Ramallah, bombs destroyed the transmitters of the official Palestinian
Authority radio station, the Voice of Palestine, as well as the police station in which
the two Israelis were killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Gaza, Israeli helicopters hit a police academy and other targets near
Yasser Arafat&#146;s headquarters. The bombing injured at least 17 Palestinians, 2
seriously, and caused damage estimated in the millions of dollars. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to justifying the bombing&#150;unprecedented since the
establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1993&#150;the Israeli government and media
sought to exploit the killing of the two soldiers to distract attention from Israel&#146;s
bloody carnage directed against unarmed Palestinian civilians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In recent weeks, Israel&#146;s actions have claimed the lives of 140
Palestinians and injured approximately 4,000 people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two soldiers, disguised as Palestinians and reportedly carrying
explosives, sub-machine-guns and guns with silencers, were apprehended in downtown
Ramallah while attempting to enter a funeral procession for a Palestinian youth killed by
Israeli snipers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nobody knows for sure what the two <i>musta&#146;aribin</i> (Israeli army
commandos disguised as Arabs) were planning to do. But most Palestinians, including PA
officials, seemed absolutely convinced the two soldiers were planning a killing spree. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We don&#146;t know exactly what they were up to, but in light of the
circumstantial evidence, it seems they were intending to carry out a massacre, assassinate
some Palestinian leaders, or just shoot randomly to cause a stampede in which many
Palestinians would die,&#148; said a high-ranking Palestinian police officer in Ramallah. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The officer, who spoke to the <i>Palestine Times</i> on condition of
anonymity, described the Israeli account of the incident as &#147;a bunch of lies.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They are telling the world that the two would-be assassins were on a
stroll in Ramallah or simply lost their way. Since when do Israeli undercover soldiers go
for walks in Palestinian villages?&#148; asked the officer sarcastically. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the Israeli army issued a plethora of confused and contradictory
statements on the incident. Initially, Israeli state-run radio quoted an army spokesperson
as saying that Palestinian mobs kidnapped three Jewish settlers from the nearby settlement
of &#147;Psegot&#148; and killed them. An hour later, the same radio station claimed that
&#147;three Israeli civilians lost their way, wandered into Ramallah and were killed by
Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A third mendacity soon followed suit around 1 p.m. on Thursday, 19
October, when an Israeli army spokesman finally provided the &#147;official story&#148; on
the incident. The spokesman claimed that four reserve soldiers were going to their camp
near Ramallah but were abducted by Palestinian police and killed at the Ramallah police
station. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Refuting the Israeli story, the Palestinians point out that the
possibility of the soldiers losing their way is extremely remote, given that there are
Palestinian or Israeli checkpoints at every road leading to Ramallah. Furthermore,
Palestinians argue, it is not logical for an Israeli soldier to lose his way yet continue
to drive all the way to the centre of Ramallah, about 5 kilometres away from the closest
Israeli checkpoint. More to the point, Ramallah was under siege by Israel and even
Palestinians were not able to get into their own town because it was tightly sealed off.
These factors suggest that the soldiers were on a premeditated mission. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the true identity of the two &#147;Arabs&#148; was
discovered&#150;not by the police but by ordinary passers-by&#150;the soldiers, sensing
the danger they faced, fled to the police station, which was later destroyed by an Israeli
aerial bombing. At the police station, the 21 Palestinian policemen there did all they
could do to protect the soldiers from the wrath of the angry crowd. Reinforcements were
called in, but it was virtually impossible for anybody to get inside the station, already
surrounded by thousands. As a result, the Palestinian police stationed inside tried to
smuggle the two Israelis out by giving them Palestinian police uniforms so that the crowd
would not recognize them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They took this measure too late, however, as the crowd had already forced
open the iron gate of the station and broke into the building, where it let vent to its
fury, beating the two Israeli soldiers to death. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Contrary to Israeli claims that Palestinian policemen participated in the
killing of the two soldiers, the policemen, including Colonel Hussein al-Sheikh, tried to
protect them but were pushed and bruised by the furious crowd. Al-Sheikh told Basem Eid,
head of a Palestinian human rights monitoring organization, that he was shocked by the
incident, which he said was being thoroughly investigated with the intention of punishing
the guilty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As usual, the Israeli media sought to dramatize the incident, ignoring the
bloodletting by its soldiers and settlers that has continued unabated since 28 September.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><font size="3">Gaza -</b> An official source in the Hamas Movement
has rejected accusations that his Movement was inciting the burning of &#147;tourism
sites&#148; such as liquor stores. He added that despite his Movement&#146;s denunciation
of such corrupt facilities, it affirmed &#147;the Movement&#146;s sole battle is with the
Zionist occupation and its main concern is uniting all efforts in resisting Zionist
terrorism and protecting our people without preoccupying itself with side battles.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He regretted that a Fatah official and a Palestinian Authority security
officer had mentioned Hamas in connection with such incidents in an untimely attempt to
smear the Movement&#146;s image. The Hamas official underlined that the Palestinian people
were facing an all-out Zionist aggression that necessitated bypassing such trivialities
and concentrating on &#147;what groups the national line and not what divides it.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A group of young men, who separated from a march organized by Hamas last
month, attacked two liquor stores along with a hotel and a restaurant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Fatah Movement, led by chairman Yasser Arafat, had severely attacked
Hamas and accused it of damaging public property in a strongly worded statement that was
described as stricter than the one attacking Zionist shelling of Palestinian lands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hamas official said that his Movement was not responsible for what
happened since it was an individual act. He added, however, that the Palestinian Muslim
people do not accept the selling of alcohol.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Israeli army pushes&nbsp;Palestinian <br>
villages to the brink of starvation</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- The Israeli army closed with earth and concrete
slabs all entrances to and from three Palestinian villages, near Nablus, in the northern
West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army last month surrounded the villages of Hares, Kifl Hares
and Dir Istiya, threatening&nbsp;to shoot any of their&nbsp;inhabitants trying to
penetrate the siege, which has been made even tighter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said all entrances and roads, even the&nbsp;unpaved
side roads, were blocked with enormous rocks, and soldiers are&nbsp;preventing people from
going in or out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following is an account by the&nbsp;inhabitants of the villages
describing the nightmare they have been going through for the last seven days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The army is&nbsp;systematically cutting down our olive trees, which
we were just&nbsp;going to harvest. Two hundred trees were already destroyed. Our land
does not produce enough food for our daily needs, we relied on what we could buy from
outside.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, even if we succeed in slipping around the soldiers and&nbsp;getting
to neighboring village, it does not help because they are in the same position, also
besieged by the army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The officer in the roadblock told me it was all in punishment for
our throwing&nbsp;stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last night our water was also cut off.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The three villages of Hares (5000), Kifl Hares (4000) and Dir Istiya
(8000)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">are surrounded by the Israeli settlements Ariel (one of the&nbsp;biggest
on the West Bank) Yakir and Revava.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This makes them part of a&nbsp; &quot;settlement bloc&quot; whose
annexation to Israel Prime Minister Barak demanded at camp David, and which is currently
mentioned as one of the areas to be unilaterally annexed in case of a Palestinian
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian villagers report settlement security guards working in
close cooperation with the soldiers besieging their villages. In recent weeks,
settler&nbsp;leaders demanded that the&nbsp;army increase its punitive measures against
the Palestinians, and some settler groups made open threats to take such punitive steps on
their own.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">News of such sieges have come also from other parts of the West Bank,
where access roads to various villages had been blocked by the army with rocks or concrete
blocks, causing extreme hardship to whole populations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Subjecting tens of thousands of&nbsp;civilians collectively to cruel
forms of structural violence is among other things a breach of the Geneva Convention to
which Israel is a signatory, and turns Barak's call upon the Palestinians for a
&nbsp; 'reduction of the violence' into sheer hypocrisy&quot; says the Israeli Gush
Shalom&nbsp;movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

320 named &#147;Muhammad&#148;</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The fertility of the Palestinian woman continues
to be the most important factor that is successfully challenging Israel&#146;s genocidal
war against the Palestinian people. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to a report published recently in the Ramallah-based Arabic
daily, <i>Al-hayatul Jadida</i>, 2,175 births were registered in the Gaza Strip alone
since the current Palestinian uprising began on 28 September.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The paper quoted the head of the gynecology department at the Shifa&#146;
hospital in Gaza, Dr. Akram Saqqa, as saying that the birth rate in Gaza since the
outbreak of the intifada was significantly higher than in the respective period last year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have an increase by 350 babies compared to the same period last
year,&#148; said Saqqa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report showed that male babies made up 60% of the overall births, and
that in 12% of the cases, twins were born.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the study showed that 320 of the newborns were given the name
&#147;Muhammad&#148; after Muhammad al-Durra, the Palestinian child who was murdered in
cold-blood by trigger-happy Israeli soldiers while seeking cover against a wall in Gaza
earlier this month. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Saqqa said that last week alone, there were 255 new deliveries at the
hospital. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that, in contrast, 9 children, the oldest of whom was 15 years
old, died at the hospital of wounds sustained by Israeli soldiers&#146; bullets.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Hayatul Jadida</i> quoted one mother, who had just given birth to a
baby boy, as saying, &#147;God gave me this, and I gave him the name Muhammad; when he
grows up, I&#146;ll see to it that he studies medicine and becomes a doctor&#133;I&#146;ll
tell him the story of Muhammad al-Durra, how they murdered him while trying to take cover
against a wall&#133;I&#146;ll also tell him the story of Sara&#133;.how they killed her
while returning from hospital.&#148;</p>

<p>Saqqa described the scene at the hospital as having an unmistakable surrealistic
dimension: &#147;Here we have mothers receiving their newborns with the tears of
joy&#133;and 20 metres away, at the surgery ward, other mothers bidding farewell to their
mutilated children murdered by the evil Zionists.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Hamas affirms prohibition of political
assassination</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza -</b> The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has affirmed that the
confrontation with the Zionist enemy was the Movement&#146;s top priority, which
encompasses the continuation of Jihad in support of the Aqsa Intifada until liberation of
Jerusalem and Palestine are reached.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Movement&#146;s assertion came in a statement issued on Tuesday, 17
October 2000, in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas stressed the prohibition of shedding Palestinian blood and
inter-Palestinian feuds and emphasized that its weapons would remain directed against the
enemy &#147;that is occupying our lands and holy shrines.&#148; It also affirmed the
prevention of political assassination and preservation of Palestinian blood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement stressed that Hamas insists on Palestinian unity and its
development in the face of the usurping enemy, in addition to enhancing this unity by all
available means. The Movement advocated dialogue and a constructive democratic process as
the sole method to solve all internal differences away from violence. It also asserted
active participation in all joint programmes and a commitment to what was agreed upon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas confirmed its absolute rejection of using insults as a weapon
against individuals and institutions and will continue to overlook accusations against
others of treachery or atheism. It also encouraged active participation in building the
country and preserving public and private property.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Movement said that it would continue its efforts to release all
detainees in Zionist jails using all available means and to continue dialogue with the
Palestinian Authority to close the political detention file.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas warned against Zionist plans, which aim at dragging the various
Palestinian groups into differences among each other resulting in battles internally that
would terminate the intifada and drive a wedge amongst the Palestinians. The Movement
stressed that it has always abided by the previous principles ever since its inception and
whoever reneged on such doctrines was not one of its members or of its supporters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas expressed pride over the Jihad of the Palestinian people in the face
of the usurping enemy. It is also monitoring certain events that transpired in Gaza City
and the tension that followed. The Movement warned against those who are not happy with
the unity of the Palestinian people in the face of the Zionist occupation, which in turn
wants to move the battle into the Palestinian arena by inciting strife and creating
internal struggles instead of keeping the confrontation solely against the occupation
forces.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement added that the popular unity and cohesion in the resistance
and confrontation field against the enemy had the greatest impact on the continuation and
escalation of the intifada, in addition to uniting the Arab-Islamic masses from around the
globe in support of our people&#146;s Jihad against the enemy and in affirmation of the
Arabism and Islamism of Jerusalem and the Palestine cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement followed the events in Gaza on the third Friday of October
during which a number of shops were burnt and slogans were voiced contrary to Hamas&#146;
method and way of dealing with the Palestinian situation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A responsible source in the Hamas Movement said that a number of persons
sneaked into its ranks and tried to divert the Movement&#146;s march and to create
inter-Palestinian tension.</p>

<p>He said that the statement was drawn up to explain the Movement&#146;s policies and to
endorse the unity of the Palestinians in the face of the Zionist enemy along with
asserting the Movement&#146;s rejection of any behaviour that might contradict its
declared principles.</p>
