    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Following two days of fiery rhetoric at a pro-Intifada conference Iran
    hosted this week, the final statement called for the creation of an international court to
    try Israeli for &quot;war crimes.&quot; </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The document, signed by more than 30 states, also condemned the United
    States for its political, military and economic support of Israel and called for an Arab
    and Muslim boycott of American products .The statement, hammered out after intense
    haggling between Iranian officials and visiting delegates, called on Islamic nations to
    &quot;break all ties, especially political and economic relations&quot; with Israel.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">It denounced &quot;organized crimes by Israel against the Palestinian
    people, the attacks against leaders of Palestinian movements, the destruction or the
    seizure of houses and land, as well as the development of Jewish sites.&quot;</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Daily Telegraph, 26 April 2001</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">THE European Union is preparing to strip Israel of privileged trade access
    as a punishment for the use of &quot;excessive force&quot; against the Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">EU diplomats confirmed yesterday that it was now almost certain that the
    15 EU foreign ministers would agree to punitive action at a key meeting on May 21,
    clamping down on Israel's long-standing abuse of Europe's &quot;Rules of Origin&quot;
    regime.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">This means Israel will no longer be able to get away with exporting
    duty-free goods made at Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza as if they were
    Israeli products. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Chicago Tribune, 25 April 2001</font> </b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">As Israel honored its war dead with solemn words and graveside
    remembrances, the radical Islamic group Hamas held a memorial Tuesday for its latest
    suicide bomber and warned that more attacks would soon follow.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..Meanwhile, militant Islamic groups said they are poised to carry out
    more bombing attacks during Israel's back-to-back observances of memorial day and
    independence day.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli police commanders said they would mobilize large numbers of
    officers in a bid to prevent attacks on memorial day..</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Chicago Tribune, 19 April 2001</font> </b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Yossi Yered, a settler whose infant son was injured in a mortar attack
    earlier this month, said Sharon had failed to provide the security he promised in his
    election campaign earlier this year.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;They talk, talk, talk, talk and when finally they do something, they
    back down with their tail between their legs,&quot; Yered said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials attribute the mortar attacks to a strategy orchestrated
    by Arafat and designed specifically to provoke Israel.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;He wants to try to get Israel to use excessive force to increase the
    chances that the United Nations will support an international force being deployed,&quot;
    Gold said.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Los Angeles Times, 19 April 2001</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Politicians and soldiers in Israel turned on each other Wednesday in a war
    of words over who was to blame for the army's hasty withdrawal from newly reoccupied
    Palestinian land--an about-face that many here said made the country appear confused and
    too easily swayed by U.S. opinion. </p>
    <font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Israeli
    troops on Tuesday seized a sliver of the Gaza Strip ceded to the Palestinians seven years
    ago. But scant hours after military commanders determined to halt Palestinian mortar fire
    announced that they would remain in the area indefinitely, they withdrew after a stern
    rebuke from Washington. </p>
    <font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Embarrassed
    Israeli officials Wednesday insisted that U.S. pressure had nothing to do with the
    decision to abandon the Gaza area, saying they had meant all along to withdraw Tuesday
    night. But that seemed to be news to the field commanders, not to mention Palestinian
    residents of the Gazan town of Beit Hanoun who watched the Israeli tanks and bulldozers
    digging in well past dusk Tuesday. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Independent, 19 April 2001 </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">America's condemnation of the Israeli action in Gaza reflects a growing
    tension in the relationship, although not a breakdown or even a fundamental shift in US
    policy.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">US-Israeli relations have been under strain for a while from the American
    perspective - and not only because of the election of Ariel Sharon and the tougher Israeli
    stance towards the Palestinians that his arrival presaged. Among the irritants have been
    Israeli sales of military technology without Washington's authorisation or even knowledge.
    Depending on the class of weapons, neither is necessarily required. But the US clearly
    feels that as Israel's major ally and arms supplier, it should be kept informed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">An illustration was supplied just this week. The Pentagon confirmed that a
    Chinese jet fighter shown in a US Defense Department video was armed with an Israeli-made
    Python air-to-air missile. The video was used by the Pentagon to show how close Chinese
    planes had come to US reconnaissance aircraft in the months before the collision on 1
    April in which a Chinese pilot died. </p>
