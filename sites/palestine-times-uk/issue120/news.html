<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israeli aggression continues despite PR
cease-fire</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In stark contradiction to the apparently only verbal cease-fire announced
by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon last week, the Israeli occupation army continued to
make almost daily incursions into PA-controlled areas, especially in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Palestinian security chief in Gaza, Abdul Razzak
al-Majayada, the Israeli army violated the alleged cease-fire 97 times in the span of four
days, or an average of one violation per hour, leaving at least three Palestinians dead
and injuring as many as a hundred others.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 25 May, Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles advanced half a kilometre
into PA territory in four areas in Rafah at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, south of
Gaza City, at the Mintar crossing and at Ouja near Jericho in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In each of these incursions, Israeli tanks barraged Palestinian
residential areas with artillery and machine-gun fire, while army bulldozers were busy
destroying and pulverizing large tracts of Palestinian farmland and orchards, a routine
punitive measure aimed at punishing ordinary Palestinians by making the intifada as costly
to them as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Israeli occupation troops shot dead two boys: Ala Bouji and Shadi
Kamal Siyam; the first near the Mintar crossing and the second during a bombardment in
Rafah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also on 25 May, Israeli tanks bombarded the Palestinian town of Beit Jala,
inflicting heavy damage on residential homes, with one home completely burned down.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Artillery bombardment of residential areas was likewise reported on 29 May
in and around Nablus, where the Israeli army deployed more tanks onto hilltops overlooking
the largest town in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, Jewish terrorists continued to terrorize Palestinian
villagers throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 28 May, a Jewish settler opened fire on Palestinian schoolchildren who
were returning home near the village of Tku, south of Bethlehem, seriously wounding two
boys.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settler terrorist reportedly fled to a nearby Jewish settlement, which
also bears the same name, with the Israeli army making no efforts to arrest or even
question him. Moreover, the settler terrorist also set Palestinian grain fields on fire in
many localities in the West Bank just as the fields were ripe for harvest, inflicting
heavy economic losses on penniless Palestinian peasants. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Normally, Jewish terrorists are not arrested or prosecuted for their
crimes, including murder, against Palestinians, a practice that has become especially
brazen since the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada more than eight months ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from continued attacks and bombardment of Palestinian population
centres, the Israeli army continued to lay siege on most Palestinian towns, cutting them
off from each other and isolating them from the rest of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The continued encirclement of Palestinian towns and villages means that
Palestinian civilians will remain under the mercy of Israeli guns, even under the rubric
of a cease-fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It means also that Israeli soldiers manning army blocks, deployed
ubiquitously throughout the West Bank, continue to humiliate, harass and detain
Palestinians suspected of taking part in Palestinian resistance. And when a Palestinian
ventures to protest the humiliation and maltreatment, the trigger-happy soldiers are
likely to open fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the Israeli occupation army has effectively come to classify the
vast bulk of Palestinians as &#147;terrorists,&#148; meaning they are subject to abrupt
detention wherever and whenever encountered. And those who couldn&#146;t be arrested, are
simply assassinated by Israeli agents, as happened to Azzam Muzher, a Fatah activist from
the Balata refugee camp near Nablus. Muzher was killed on 25 May when a bomb, planted by
Israeli agents, exploded in his car, mutilating him beyond recognition and wounding six
more people, two seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In reaction to the Israeli terror, Palestinian civilians carried out two
car-bomb attacks on 25 May: one against an Israeli army outpost in Gaza and carried out by
Hamas; and the other in Khadera, in central Israel, carried out by the Islamic Jihad
organization. The human-bombers were killed in the two operations and scores of Israelis
were slightly injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two more car-bomb blasts rocked West Jerusalem, the first shortly after
midnight on 26 May and the other the following morning. The two booby-trapped cars were
parked in the vicinity of a major police station, and one of them reportedly contained
several mortar shells. While the two explosions caused a few casualties, they nevertheless
generated a tremendous amount of panic and anxiety among Israeli security and political
officials, not to mention the public at large, as the explosions demonstrated that the
Palestinians could cast terror in the heart of the city Israel unilaterally claims to be
its capital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A further Palestinian retaliation took place on 29 May. Palestinian
fighters killed the security officer at the settlement of Itamar near Nablus. Palestinians
accused the settler officer of taking part in the murder of a number of Palestinian olive
growers five months ago. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Suicidal bomb attacks against Israeli targets acquired additional moral
weight this week when the Mufti of Palestine, Ikrema Sabri, said in a Friday sermon that
martyrdom operations were a legitimate means for self-defence. He pointed out that
fighters killed in these operations are true martyrs, a view that infuriated Israeli
officials who demanded that Sabri be deported to southern Lebanon or banished to Gaza for
&#147;the incitement.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest religious opinion is added to a plethora of fatwas or religious
edicts by prominent Islamic scholars who have given these operations the benefit of the
doubt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this month, the Rector of al-Azhar, Dr. Muhammed Sayed Tantawi,
was quoted as saying that martyrdom operations were valid as long as they are not carried
out against non-combatants, especially children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Sheikh Yousef Qaradawi, a widely recognized authority on sunni
jurisprudence, ruled that martyrdom operations constituted a high level of Jihad against
oppression and that they should not be labelled as &#147;suicidal bomb attacks&#148; but
rather &#147;martyrdom operations.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, the Israeli official religious establishment, the High
Rabbinate, made a fresh provocation to the Muslim world last week when it disclosed plans
to study the building of a Jewish synagogue inside the Haram al-Sharif esplanade in East
Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The chief Rabbi of Israel, Yisrael Meir Laou, was quoted by the Israeli
State-run radio as saying that he had ordered a thorough study of the subject.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The revelation, apparently aimed at testing Muslim reactions to the
increasingly daring Jewish proclamations to that effect, drew angry reactions, not only
from Palestinian political and religious leaders, but also from Muslim leaders around the
world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Mufti of Egypt, Dr. Naser Farid Wasel, described the proposal as
amounting to a declaration of war on all Muslims world-wide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He warned that building a synagogue on the Haram al-Sharif would trigger a
Third World War, saying Muslims around the world wouldn&#146;t allow such a provocation to
their religion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He warned the Israeli rabbinate &#147;not to play with fire.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon steps up killing rampage </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a rabid escalation of State-sponsored terror against Palestinians, the
Israeli occupation army has significantly stepped up its wanton bombardment of population
centres, killing and injuring still more innocent civilians and reducing numerous
buildings and homes to rubble.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In nearly 95% of the cases, the indiscriminate artillery bombardment
targeted defenceless civilians, who can neither escape to a safer place, lest they be
killed by machine-gun strafing, nor stay in fortified shelters, because there are
virtually none. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such was the gruesome case of four-month-old toddler Iman Hijo, in Khan
Younis, who was killed on 7 May by Israeli artillery shrapnel while in the lap of her
mother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to sources at Nasser&#146;s Hospital in Khan Younis, the
shrapnel pierced the baby&#146;s abdomen, exiting through her back, and then penetrated
her mother&#146;s bosom, injuring her seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to Iman and her 19-year-old mother, Suzan, 20 other civilians,
mostly children and women, were also injured, some seriously, by the blind bombardment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Defence Minister Benyamin Benalizer, apparently concerned about
negative publicity, sought to mitigate the brutality of the latest Israeli crime by saying
the army did not intend to kill civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I assure you that we don&#146;t have a deliberate policy of hitting
civilians,&#148; said the gleeful-looking minister, who earlier announced that he had
given the army &#147;full freedom to act against terror.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But just what kind of beings does Benalizer expect to find in those
concrete boxes on which the deadly shells are fired? Maybe &#147;two-legged animals,&#148;
as former-Israeli Prime Minister Menchem Begin once referred to Palestinians, or maybe
&#147;snakes, vermin and dirty animals,&#148; as Rabbi Ovadia Yosef of Shas recently
called the Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While Israeli shells were raining death on Khan Younis in southern Gaza,
Israeli tanks were also raining death and havoc on residential neighbourhoods in Tulkarm
in the northern West Bank, claiming yet another civilian life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tulkarm District governor Izzedin al-Sharif described the bombardment as
&#147;indiscriminate, blind and deadly.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They (the Israeli army) barrage the town with artillery and tank
shells non-stop, and they don&#146;t give the slightest damn where the shells will land
and how many innocent people they will kill.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The victim in Tulkarm is 55-year-old Hussein Abu Tammam, who was
moderately injured when his newly built home was hit by an artillery shell. And as the man
was being transferred to hospital in a Red Crescent ambulance, the ambulance itself came
under heavy machine-gun fire. One bullet hit Abu Tammam in the head, killing him
instantly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, on 6 May, a large Israeli army force made yet another incursion
into the Palestinian town of Beit Jala, killing 45-year-old Muhammed I&#146;bayat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The incursion, which was preceded by wanton bombardment of residential
homes, was half-heartedly criticized by the Bush administration which issued the same
platitudinous remarks about the need for &#147;self-restraint on both sides.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A stronger censure, however, came from the European Union, which
reportedly warned Israel that its extensive economic ties with Europe would suffer if the
invading force didn&#146;t pull out immediately.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The force eventually withdrew, but not before utterly destroying and
ravaging many buildings and residential homes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Israeli assassins carried out another assassination in
Bethlehem on 5 May, this time targeting a former Islamic Jihad activist whom the
occupation authorities accused of &#147;carrying out hostile activities.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to an eyewitness, the undercover &#147;soldiers&#148;, disguised
as Palestinians, riddled Ahmed Khalil Asad, 38, with more than 20 bullets, while he was
standing outside his grocery store.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few hours earlier, four other Palestinians in the Jenin area narrowly
escaped another assassination attempt by the Israeli army. One of the four was seriously
wounded, while the other three were lightly wounded.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the killing rampage, the Israeli army also kept up its
characteristic sinister practice of destroying Palestinian homes, a diabolically racist
measure aimed at tormenting Palestinians and checking their demographic growth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 7 May, the Israeli army demolished another home at the Beit Hanina
neighbourhood, just north of Jerusalem, ostensibly to use the site of the demolished home
to build a villa for a Jewish immigrant family.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The home is added to more than 400 Arab homes the Israeli army has
callously destroyed since the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada more than seven months
ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More homes are reported slated for destruction, particularly in and around
East Jerusalem, where the Sharon government seems intent on creating more irreversible
facts on the ground that would make the return of the occupied city to the Palestinians
impossible. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Terror creates desperation</b></u><br>
Israel&#146;s overwhelming terror against Palestinians, which most Palestinians do not
hesitate to compare with the Nazi reign of terror, is devastating to the psychological
health of ordinary civilians, especially children and women.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This very real terror, which often transcends reality, recently caused a
Palestinian man from the Shujaiyya neighbourhood, east of Gaza, to embark on a
&#147;collective martyrdom&#148; to highlight the increasingly unbearable nightmare in the
Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eyewitnesses said Ziad Hajaj, 36, placed his two children on the hood of
his car and then drove with his wife toward the Jewish settlement of Kfar Dorom, with the
intention getting killed, in order to &#147;get rid of this life of misery and
humiliation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian security men in the area sought unsuccessfully to convince the
distraught man to reconsider his decision.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For their part, Israeli soldiers began pointing their guns, ready to pull
the trigger.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the very last moment, however, a representative of the Red Cross
arrived at the scene and was able to calm down the man and get him away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The unprecedented level of terror the Israeli army is using against the
Palestinian people is reminiscent of the Palestinian Nakba or catastrophe of 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, 53 years later, many Israeli politicians, including some occupying
key positions in Ariel Sharon&#146;s government, make no secret of their desire that the
present Israeli onslaught against the Palestinians will eventually induce another mass
expulsion of the Palestinians from their homeland, a sort of another Nakba.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">F-16s against stones and a few old rifles</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special to PT</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, 18 May, in a brazen display of arrogance of power, the Israeli
government of certified war criminal Ariel Sharon used the second deadliest weapon at its
disposal (after its sizeable nuclear arsenal) to rain death on Palestinian towns in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, ostensibly in the hope of coercing the Palestinians to end their
intifada and succumb to the Zionist will.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon met with his &#147;inner security cabinet,&#148; which ironically
included Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres and War Minister Benyamin Benalizer, and
shortly afterwards, the three concluded by ordering a devastating air-strike at
&#147;targets&#148; in several Palestinian towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, using
F-16 fighter-bombers, considered as &#147;Israel&#146;s long strategic arm.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And by 5:30 p.m. Palestine time, the lethal combat aircraft dropped
munitions as large as 250 kilograms on a prison, a police dormitory, and TV relay stations
in Nablus, Tulkarm and Ramallah as well as Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By midnight, paramedics, rescue workers and ordinary Palestinians
recovered 11 bodies, some badly incinerated and mutilated, from under the rubble, often
using their bare hands and primitive tools.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More than a hundred people&#151;mostly civilians&#151;were injured, ten
critically, and over ten buildings were bombed out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army declared that the devastating strike on the Old Nablus
Prison was aimed at &#147;liquidating&#148; a Hamas activist who had killed two Israeli
soldiers during an aborted operation to kill him at his village of Asira Shamailya near
Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mahmoud Abu Hannoud was in the targeted building, but he miraculously
escaped death, suffering only minor scratches and cuts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What kind of a State sends F-16 fighter jets to chase a single
individual,&#148; remarked Abu Hannoud&#146;s father, who criticized the PA for keeping
his son in jail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, the PA claimed that Abu Hannoud was being kept in jail for his own
protection from a possible Israeli assassination attempt on his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the bombing of the prison by F-16 bombers proved that the PA was
right and justified in releasing the rest of the Hamas fighters and activists from its
custody if only to allow Israel to murder them <i>en masse</i>. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another massacre</b></u><br>
If things are to be called by their real name, the bombing was no less than a massacre in
terms of its devastating effect, the means used to inflict the resulting death and
destruction, and also in the aforethought intent to spill as much Palestinian blood as
possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, a few minutes before the strike at the Central Prison building in
Nablus, which also houses a police squad in charge of maintaining law and order, Israeli
occupation troops stationed on a hilltop overlooking the building barraged the area with
machine-gun fire, apparently for the purpose of keeping as many people as possible
confined inside the building in order to be killed in the imminent bombing that followed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the Israeli rationale was like this: those who won&#146;t
be killed in the machine-gun strafing will be killed by the hell about to descend from
above.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Ramallah, other F-16 jets attacked two Force-17 posts, leaving one dead
and injuring six others, one seriously who died two days later.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in Gaza, the same type of aircraft dropped laser-guided bombs on the
Ansar Security post, in the vicinity of Yasser Arafat&#146;s headquarters, reducing the
premises to rubble.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, Israeli officials bragged about the use of their awesome air
power against an essentially unarmed population, saying the Palestinians &#147;should
realize how powerful we are and what we are capable of doing to them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Israel will go to any extent to defend Israelis,&#148; a defiant
Sharon said in a tone reminiscent of his gleeful mood following the Sabra and Shatilla
massacres in 1982.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Sharon government sought to justify its use of fighter jets, saying it
was the &#147;appropriate response&#148; for the martyrdom operation in the coastal town
of Netanya shortly before noon on Friday, 18 May.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attack, carried out by a 20-year-old Palestinian from the town of
Tulkarm, a member of the Hamas military wing, was in retaliation for the callous murder on
14 May by Israeli occupation troops of five Palestinian civilian policemen at a guard post
south of Ramallah, as well as the murderous killing of four-month-old Iman Hijjo in the
Gaza Strip on 7 May as a result of shrapnel by an Israeli artillery shell.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The martyr-bomber, later identified as Mahmoud Marmash, said in a
pre-recorded message released after the attack that he did what he did as a reaction to
overwhelming Israeli oppression which he could not withstand. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out, passionately, that he was deeply moved and shocked by the
killing of Hijjo and the cold-blooded murder of the five policemen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Five Jewish settlers were killed in the Netanya bombing, but the
psychological effects and fallout on the Israeli Jewish population was much stronger.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, according to an opinion survey conducted by the mass Hebrew paper <i>Yediot
Ahranot</i>, nearly two thirds of the adult Zionist population said they were more worried
now about their personal security than they were when Sharon came to power three months
ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is roughly the same percentage of Israelis who elected Sharon on 6
February in the hope that he would restore security and &#147;fight terror.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of the bombing in Netanya, and the continued Palestinian
resistance to Israel&#146;s brutal, even criminal, onslaught in the West Bank, Sharon has
so far failed to fulfil his pre-election promises, which explains his overkill policy
toward the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, it is widely expected that Sharon will continue to be active in
killing defenceless Palestinian civilians and lightly armed Palestinian policemen in order
to cover up his failure to stop the uprising and restore &#147;security&#148;, and also to
appease and placate the hard-core, right-wing extremists, particularly the settlers and
their supporters, who ostensibly would continue to give him the benefit of the doubt as
long as Palestinian blood is being spilled and as long as he continues to torment the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An indication to that effect was the attempted assassination on 20 May of
the Preventive Security Chief in the West Bank, Colonel Jebril Rajoub.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli tanks stationed at the settlement of Psigot fired several shells
at Rajoub&#146;s villa in al-Bira, injuring five of his bodyguards and badly damaging the
luxurious house.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Defence Minister Benyamin Benalizer claimed the shelling was not
intentional, but a high-ranking officer in the Israeli army said the army would bombard
the place again &#147;whenever it deemed that [action] necessary.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajoub is the man on whom Israel depends much in reviving security
coordination with Israel and, more importantly, in reining in Islamist fighters opposed to
the Oslo Accords.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the shelling, which nearly cost him his life, Rajoub described
Israeli political and military leaders as a &#147;band of street criminals and
gangsters.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Eight million Palestinians reaffirm commitment to
Palestine</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An estimated eight million Palestinians at home and in the Diaspora
observed on 15 May the 53rd anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba, when Zionist Jews seized
Palestine and expelled the bulk of its people from their ancestral homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, young and old, men and women,
marched in the streets of the West Bank and Gaza Strip carrying placards and shouting
slogans affirming the right of return for some four million Palestinian refugees eager to
return to their native hometowns and villages in what is now Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;No right of return, no peace,&#148; read one large placard in
Ramallah. &#147;Denial of right of return means victory for racism and apartheid,&#148;
read another. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At noon local time, as sirens blared, Palestinians observed three minutes
of silence during which verses from the Holy Qur&#146;an were recited in honour of the
more than 200,000 Palestinians who have lost their lives defending their country. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Afterwards, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat delivered a passionate
speech, carried live on radio and television, castigating Israel for trying to &#147;kill
justice with tanks, rockets and helicopter gun-ships.&#148; He criticized the
international community for its &#147;hypocrisy, double standards and silence in the face
of overwhelming oppression of Palestinians.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They are trying to falsify history and kill justice with artillery,
tanks and helicopter gun-ships, but they shall not succeed, for we have the truth on our
side, and justice shall eventually prevail.&#148; The Palestinian leader appealed to the
world community to &#147;wake up from its enduring dormancy to see the wanton acts of
murder and destruction being perpetrated against our people.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He asked bitterly: &#147;Don&#146;t our people have the right to be free
like the rest of humanity?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat stressed that a just and durable peace in the region would not be
achieved without total Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967,
including al-Quds al-Sharif, or East Jerusalem, as well as the implementation of the right
of return for Palestinian refugees in accordance with United Nations resolution 194. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat then appealed to Palestinians to withstand Israeli oppression and
persecution. &#147;Have you faith and more faith, patience and more patience, an
hour&#146;s extra patience could make the difference between victory and defeat,&#148;
Arafat said, quoting one of Prophet Mohammed&#146;s hadiths (sayings). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, speaking briefly after Arafat, said the
&#147;makers of the Nakba have failed to break our will,&#148; arguing that &#147;the
Intifada of yesterday, today and tomorrow is a sublime expression of rejection of
modern-day slavery.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel responded to the largely peaceful demonstrations and marches with
the habitual rubber-coated bullets and live ammunition. Indeed, trigger-happy Israeli
soldiers opened fire, often indiscriminately, on demonstrators in Hebron, Ramallah,
Tulkarm and Nablus, injuring as many as 100 people, including minors and children. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Gaza Strip, Israeli army bullets killed two more Palestinians, one
of them, 35-year-old Abdul Hakim al-Mana&#146;amah, an associate of Hamas leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, the Israeli occupation army carried out some of the most barbaric
acts of State-sponsored-terrorism against unprotected Palestinian civilians and the
lightly armed Palestinian police force.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At 2 a.m. on 14 May, an Israeli force murdered, in cold blood, five
Palestinian policemen at a guard-post near Beitunya, south of Ramallah. Palestinians
viewed the killing as an especially treacherous act, as the five victims were assigned to
liaise with their Israeli security counterparts in the area. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a vile and unethical crime, and Israel will not get away
with it,&#148; said an angry Arafat, pointing out that the victims&#146; guard post was
established in coordination with the Israeli army. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Haj Ismael Jaber, commander of the Palestinian Authority (PA) police force
in the West Bank, stressed the perfidious nature of the Israeli attack. &#147;The whole
thing was unexpected; it never occurred to us that the Israelis would murder the very
people with whom they liaise and coordinate on a daily basis.&#148; He added indignantly,
&#147;This is a massacre, a real massacre, except in this case, policemen are
killed.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army did not comment on the incident, underscoring the almost
total callousness toward the Palestinians. A terse statement carried by Israeli State-run
radio only spoke of Israeli occupation soldiers spotting moving objects south of Ramallah,
opening fire and killing them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, several Israeli officials, including War Minister Benyamin
Benalizer, admitted the Palestinian policemen were killed by mistake, a testimony to the
trigger-happy approach Israeli army terrorists adopt toward Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army killed two more Gazans and injured 20 others&#151;among
them a child who sustained serious wounds&#151;on 14 May when it barraged Rafah with
machine-gun and artillery fire. The murder of the seven Gazans in Beitunya and Gaza came
only a few hours after Israeli tanks, helicopter gun-ships and navy gunboats pounded
several neighbourhoods throughout the Strip, injuring many civilians and causing
widespread destruction. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 12 May, Israeli helicopters fired several missiles at a car outside PA
headquarters in Jenin, killing two Palestinians&#151;a Fatah activist and a policeman. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two men killed, who were not the intended targets of the assassination
operation, join 50 other Palestinians murdered by the Israeli army in a manner reflecting
both Israel&#146;s technological edge and its arrogance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Israeli army continues to destroy vast stretches of
Palestinian orchards and vineyards on a daily basis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an article published on 13 May in London&#146;s <i>Observer</i>
newspaper, Lord Ian Gilmour, who toured the Gaza Strip recently, referred to this wanton
and widespread vandalism: &#147;Israelis used to boast that they had made the desert
bloom; now they can boast they have turned previously blooming Palestinian land into a
desert.&#148; </p>

Afghanistan<br>
for alleged discrimination against non-Muslims</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>-The national director of an American Zionist group
known as the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, has harshly attacked the government
of Afghanistan for alleged discriminatory measures against non-Muslims in the beleaguered
Islamic country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Foxman, who actively supports apartheid in Palestine and advocates the
expulsion of all non-Jews from Palestine, reportedly compared alleged anti-Hindu
discrimination in Afghanistan to the so-called holocaust.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The manifestly corrupt analogy and other blatant statements against Islam
by prominent Jewish leaders are ostensibly meant to incite Western, especially American,
public opinion against Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Western press reported this week that the Taliban government of
Afghanistan was contemplating asking members of the tiny Hindu community in Afghanistan to
wear distinctive signs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Taliban officials denied the reports, calling them &#147;Zionist
misinformation aimed at besmirching Islam&#146;s image.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The right-wing English newspaper, the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, a mouthpiece
for Jewish settlers and other Israeli fascist groups, quoted Foxman as urging the
international community to speak out against Taliban.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">American Jewish leaders are always outspoken against alleged human rights
violations when anti-Zionist elements are the villains.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the same leaders remain astonishingly silent when Israel, the
world&#146;s last remaining apartheid regime, indulges in systematic discrimination
against non-Jews in general and Palestinians in particular.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Chief Rabbi reveals plans to destroy Islamic
shrines in Jerusalem</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>Yisrael Meir Lau, Chief Rabbi of the Zionist
regime, revealed plans by the Chief Rabbinate for the seizure and demolition of Islamic
Shrines in East Jerusalem for the purpose of erecting a Jewish synagogue on their ruinous
sites.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli State-run radio on Monday, 20 May, quoted Lau as saying that
the Chief Rabbinate had formed a committee &#147;to look into the matter,&#148; adding
that the committee didn&#146;t yet present its recommendations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lau reportedly said the committee was instructed to locate the site where
the planned synagogue would be built, suggesting that this would necessitate the
destruction of the two Islamic sites in the area: the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the
Rock.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Aqsa Mosque is viewed by Muslims as the third holiest, directly after
the Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet&#146;s Mosque in Medina in the Arabian
Peninsula. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lau said the High Rabbinate was facing a lot of hesitation and reluctance
on the matter due to its extreme sensitivity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He also recognized that the Jewish State would have to weigh international
reaction to seizing Islamic holy places and building a synagogue in the heart of Haram
al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are numerous Israeli messianic and terrorist groups dedicated to the
destruction of Islamic holy places in Jerusalem, believing that this act would accelerate
and expedite the coming of the Jewish messiah or redeemer, who would rule the world from
Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Jews also believe that the appearance of the redeemer will be
preceded by internecine wars and bloodshed on a very wide scale, hence many Jewish
terrorist groups constantly seek to spark violence and wars in order to fulfil their
prophetic whims. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israel uses PR to cloud military occupation,
apartheid </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>The Israeli apartheid regime is launching a
vociferous misinformation campaign in the United States and Europe aimed at clouding the
reality of Israeli military occupation of Palestine and the system of apartheid adopted
against non-Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the context of this campaign, Israeli officials are trying to throw the
ball into the Palestinian court, especially in the aftermath of the cease-fire announced
by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on 22 May but seldom observed by the Israeli
occupation army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, since the announcement was made on 22 May, Israeli tanks made
several incursions into Palestinian Authority-held territories during which several
Palestinian homes were destroyed and numerous acres of orchards and vegetable crops were
utterly destroyed by Israeli bulldozers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the inconsistency between what Sharon, Peres and other Israeli
officials are saying publicly and what the Israeli army is doing on the ground is not all
there is in the Israeli misinformation campaign, mainly aimed at further beguiling the
American public opinion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the overemphasis of the issue of cease-fire, as if there were two
armies and two armed forces fighting each other, suggests that Sharon and his extreme
right-wing government is interested in winning American public opinion first and foremost,
and not interested a bit in working things out with the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the refusal of the Zionist regime to pull out Israel tanks and
army personnel away from the gates of Palestinian towns eviscerates the cease-fire of any
substance or goodwill if ever it has a thing as such .</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the final analysis, the Zionists are trying to conceal from the rest of
the world the fact that the Palestinian people are languishing under a malignant military
occupation and that the so-called &#147;violence&#148; is in fact a legitimate resistance
against that occupation. </p>

was the only way to stop the Palestinian uprising against Israeli military occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrorist, Yitzhak Levy, who also heads an extreme right-wing Israeli
party known as Mifdal, opined in a radio interview that the Israeli occupation army ought
to enter the PA enclaves and &#147;destroy&#148; all Palestinians opposed to Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Levy, who adopts a racist ideology considered by many people as the Jewish
equivalent of Nazism, said the army should stay in Palestinian towns and villages until
all resistance is vanquished and destroyed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Levy proposed that the occupation army would then hire Palestinian
quislings to carry out municipal tasks.</p>

a long battle with illness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Lughud was born and reared at the Ajami neighbourhood in Yaffa into an
affluent Palestinian family, and when the Zionist State of Israel was created, his family
was expelled at gunpoint, like the bulk of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1949, he travelled to the United States where he obtained several
academic degrees, including a Ph.D. in International Relations in 1957.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Lughud remained devoted to the national Palestinian cause despite the
lure of life in the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his numerous lectures, articles and works, he demonstrated an
unflinching faith in the justice of the Palestinian cause and the eventuality of victory
over Zionist apartheid. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> Palestinian health officials have again warned
children and minors against eating or touching poisoned chocolates spread by Israeli
agents for the purpose of killing Palestinian children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Samples of the poisoned chocolates and other types of sweets have been

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Thursday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed earlier reports
concerning the poisoned chocolates, saying Israeli denials of responsibility for the
deadly sweets were expected.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What do you expect them to say? The Zionist Jews would kill a person
and participate in his funeral procession to cast away suspicions of responsibility,&#148;
said a Palestinian health official in the Hebron area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ministry asked school principals and teachers to educate children
about the dangers of touching and eating poisoned chocolates.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, a spokesman for the Israeli army denied any responsibility for
the dirty action. However, the fact that Hebrew markings and other Israeli trademarks were
found on the chocolate wrapper leave no doubt as to the origin of the lethal objects.</p>
