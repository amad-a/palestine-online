<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Questions on the 50th Anniversary of Israel's
Creation</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Azzam Tamimi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How much different are the Zionists from the Nazis?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One would expect the horrible persecution of Jews at the
hands of the Nazis to create among world Jewry a culture of opposition to
and abhorrence toward all forms of oppression and persecution. Regrettably,
very few Jews nowadays&shy;in fact only those who by virtue of their humanity,
sincerity and conscience are shunned and ridiculed by their Jewish communities
around the world&shy;attempt to compare the painful experience of the Holocaust
suffered by their ancestors to the no-less horrible and equally sinister
policies pursued by the State of Israel. The eyes of few Jews, indeed very
few, are not blurred by the Zionist propaganda that has been successful
in achieving two main objectives: the first is to blackmail the entire humanity
in the name of Holocaust victims, and the second is to justify, as a consequence
of the first, the crimes against humanity perpetrated in Palestine and Lebanon
by the State of Israel. Just as Hitler gave a bad reputation to Germany
and its people, history and culture, Zionism is more anti-Semitic than the
most avowedly anti-Semitic fascists. Hitler brought shame on Germany, and
Israel brings shame on the Jews of the world. Zionism and Israel have managed
to create and reflect the image of a dehumanized Jew, one who enjoys the
killing of Palestinian and Lebanese children for no reason other than for
the determination of their fathers and mothers to struggle for the liberation
of their homelands from foreign occupation. Zionism and Israel have also
created, and they continuously reflect, the image of a hypocritical Jew,
who claims to be a victim of anti-Semitism while at the same time supporting
and funding the racist Zionist regime in Occupied Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nowhere in the world (at least not after the dismantling
of Apartheid), apart from the State of Israel, is racism, theft, torture
and murder justified in the name of a divine right and sanctioned by law.
Based on a promise believed to have been given exclusively to the Jews by
God, the confiscation of the land of another people, the killing of many
of them and the banishment of many more is legitimate in the eyes of the
Jews. In the name of saving the lives of the sacred super-human Jews, and
by law, Palestinians suspected of terrorism may be tortured by their Israeli
interrogators until they confess or die.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amnesty International has recently criticized the Israeli
government for proposing a new draft of the General Security Service (GSS)
Law that will continue to legitimize Israel's torture of so-called security
detainees during interrogation and to allow the perpetrators of such abuses
to get away with it. One article of the new law grants GSS employees immunity
from criminal liability if they are acting 'in good faith and in a reasonable
manner in the course of carrying out their duties.' Amnesty International
warned that if interrogation rules sanction and defend the use of torture
and ill-treatment as they do now, even GSS agents who cause death, permanent
disability or psychological damage will continue to benefit with impunity
for their activities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To prevent any exposure of the atrocities perpetrated by
Israeli interrogation officers, the draft law would make it a criminal offence
punishable by imprisonment for any member of the GSS or any member of the
Knesset committee entrusted with oversight of the GSS to disclose information
without authorization. In other words, as Amnesty International puts it,
the new draft law provides no defense for whistleblowers, who, for reasons
of conscience, reveal information to the public about human rights violations
by the GSS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Is it possible that the Israelis mistake the Palestinians
for the Nazis? Throughout the history of Palestine, since its conquest by
Muslims in the seventh century, Jews and Muslims coexisted peacefully. Even
when Jews were persecuted in Europe and banished from many of its countries,
they found no safe haven to seek refuge in other than the Muslim world,
including Palestine itself. However, the attitude of twentieth century world
Jewry toward the Muslims, and the Palestinians in particular, is not one
of gratitude and appreciation, but one of revenge, hatred, malicious aggression
and shameful thanklessness. It is as if the Muslims, and the Palestinians
in particular, not the Europeans, were responsible for the miseries and
sufferings of Jews. On the fiftieth anniversary of the occupation of Palestine,
one must ask: why should the Palestinians be made to pay for the crimes
of Europe, and especially those of the Nazis, against the Jews? Why should
comforting the survivors of the Holocaust and compensating them take the
form of the creation of a homeland for them in somebody else's homeland?
If the West is so drowned in guilt because of its attitude toward the Jews,
would it not have been more just for it to act collectively to create a
homeland for European Jews somewhere within Germany or perhaps somewhere
in the United States of America, their current foster parent?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Is it time for the Jews to wake up and dissociate themselves
from Zionism? On the fiftieth anniversary of the 1948 Zionist crime against
humanity in Palestine, one notices significant and very interesting changes
in the world. Some of these changes indicate that the life of the State
of Israel is approaching an end. On the one hand, the survival of this islet
of alien intruders, who clearly belong more to Europe than to the Islamic
Middle East, in an increasingly furious and boiling ocean of Muslims, is
impossible. On the other hand, the creators of the State of Israel will
not be able to maintain it for long, and the post-colonial Arab territorial
States that provide it with security and protection from the anger of more
than 1 billion Muslims are themselves desperately struggling for survival.
The peace process, which is aimed primarily at reducing the dependency of
the State of Israel on the West, has proven to be a non-starter, a deformed
and stillborn foetus, whose conception had, in some ironic way, convinced
so many Palestinians and Arabs that peace with Israel is impossible. The
promised land of milk and honey, which was alleged to have been without
a people, has shown itself to be a harsh and thorny terrain belonging to
a people who generation after generation grow more determined neither to
forget nor forgive. It would indeed be better for the Jews and their future
generations to reconsider their position toward the State of Israel. It
will do them no good to be involved in a campaign of hostility against the
Muslims, who are instructed by their own faith to treat them well so long
as they do not initiate aggression. The association of the Jews with the
State of Israel should not be thought of as a historical inevitability.
At the turn of the century very few Jews supported Zionism, few of them
nowadays oppose it. It is hoped that very soon many more of them will realize
that Zionism and the State of Israel, not the Holocaust, are the worst things
that have ever happened to the Jews in their entire history.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians exasperated by America's &quot;scandalous
double standards&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While most Palestinians are not harrowing to secure gas
masks (they haven't any), sealed rooms and other protective means against
a conceivable Iraqi attack on Israel-Palestine in which weapons of mass
destruction could be used, most Palestinians' hearts are never the less
boiling with anger at &quot;the odious duplicity&quot; characterizing American
policy toward Iraq and Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the mere allusion of the current Iraqi crisis invites
ready and embittered Palestinian protestations at the bluntly-conspicuous
American double standards in dealing with Saddam Hussein's partial non-compliance
with UN resolutions on the one hand, and with Israel's enduring and contemptuous
disregard for international legitimacy, on the other. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The asymmetry is amply stark in every Palestinian's mind,
if only because Netanyahu is nonchalantly turning his back to the entire
peace process, leaving an exhausted Yasser Arafat imploring a scandal-ridden
Bill Clinton to do something to save the moribund peace process from Netanyahu's
equivocations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, the words are on everybody's tongue: &quot;Why don't
they (the United States) force Israel to comply with UN resolutions just
as they are determined to do so in the Gulf?&quot; Why, why...?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For most Palestinians, the answer is simple: The United
States is only the monkey and Israel is the organ grinder that determines
American steps toward Iraq and Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For many ordinary Palestinians, the current American crusade
against Iraq has nothing to do in reality with the alleged hiding by Iraq
of forbidden weapons of mass destruction. This is only a pretext. In fact,
some Palestinians (their number is increasing) go as far as arguing that
the American build-up is not even aimed against Saddam Hussein. Their rationale
is that the Iraqi dictator and the continuous crises he instigates serve
the strategic and geopolitical interests of the United States. Last week,
a professor of Political Science at Bethlehem University was even more audacious,
claiming that the current showdown &quot;is merely concocted by Saddam Hussein
and the Americans.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Look,&quot; the professor said, with a mystifying
grin, &quot;they are using him to blackmail the Gulf sheikdoms for more
oil money and also to perpetuate their military presence in that part of
the world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The professors' words, however, had no echo of note among
the few thousand, mostly young, demonstrators who during the last two weeks
demonstrated in support of &quot;the Iraqi people&quot; and against American
bellicosity and arrogance of power.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact that Saddam Hussein is a repugnant despot didn't
deter hundreds of disenchanted Palestinians from taking to the streets,
shouting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans and even holding Saddam
Hussein's portrait aloft alongside that of Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We can't remain silent when the cowboys are about
to rain death on Baghdad....men, women and children will be the victims,&quot;
protested one demonstrator outside the Dheishe refugee camp on 16 February.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sporadic demonstrations in support of Iraq proved to
be a sensational item for much of the Israeli media and a definite propagandistic
food for thought for Benyamin Netanyahu, as well as an embarrassment for
the Palestinian Authority, which found itself pressed between the American-Israeli
hammer and the anvil of the Palestinian public opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA, however, proved once again that it valued the &quot;legitimacy&quot;
that comes from American and Israeli acceptance more than that which comes
from the Palestinian public. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence on 18 and 19 February, the PA Minister of Culture
and Information, Yasser Abed Rabu, ordered the closure of a score of private
TV stations for &quot;inciting the public to show solidarity with Iraq.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Ghazi al Jabali, the General Commander of the
PA police in Gaza, issued a decree banning all pro-Iraqi demonstrations
throughout the autonomous enclaves &quot;due to their detrimental impact
on Palestinian national interests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly, Jabali and Abed Rabu were only carrying out instructions
from Yasser Arafat who viewed American consternation with the demonstrations
as harmful to Palestinian interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Palestinians, along with the peoples of the
region, are holding their breath, awaiting the unfolding of the crisis and
hoping for a peaceful end.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat and the Holocaust Museum</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Much was made of the on-again/off-again invitation extended
by the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. to Palestine Authority President
Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many Jewish leaders denounced the invitation saying it
would send out the &quot;wrong message,&quot; alleging that Arafat is responsible
for the murder of many Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Well, let's get one thing straight from the beginning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>President Arafat is genuine when he says that he does not
discriminate against Christians, Muslims or Jews. Further, Arafat does not
brand every member of the Jewish faith as being responsible for the atrocities
that Israel and Zionism committed against the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At issue is not whether Arafat should or should not visit
the Holocaust Museum. The real issue is whether or not Arafat should make
such a visit before Israeli officials make similar gestures toward memorials
marking the killings of Palestinians by Israelis and Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither Arafat nor the Palestinian people are responsible
for the murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis during World War II. In fact,
some argue that the non-Arab West is more responsible. Jewish refugees that
America, Britain, France and other European countries routinely refused
immigration entry, ended up in Nazi concentration camps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Typically, Israel and many Jewish leaders who complain
about a visit by Arafat to the Holocaust Museum are guilty of a double standard.
To them, the issue is simply whether an enemy of Israel should be allowed
to show compassion for the suffering of Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the real issue is much broader and more startling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You see, I don't think Arafat should visit the Holocaust
Museum, at least not until after Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu
shows similar compassion. He should first express an interest in visiting
a memorial marking the murder of Palestinians by Jews and Israelis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The one that comes immediately to mind is the memorial
that Palestinians and some Americans are striving to establish to mark the
now-destroyed village of Deir Yassin. On 9 April 1948, Etzel and LEHI units
attacked the village and murdered 254 Palestinian civilians in cold blood,
a massacre the Israelis continue to treat with arrogant denials and unbelievable
&quot;excuses.&quot; (Visit the Internet at www.deiryassin.org to learn
more about this event.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu should embrace this effort and recognize the
massacre as a crime against the Palestinian people, in much the same way
that Arafat intended to visit the Holocaust Museum and demonstrate compassion
for Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War II.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even more so, Netanyahu has a special need to show compassion
to the Palestinians for this particular event. The massacre was perpetrated
by the very men who established the Likud Party that he now heads, the late
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Begin headed Etzel and Shamir headed LEHI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Both Begin and Shamir are Netanyahu's mentors. Netanyahu
wears their legacy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Have Jews died as the result of Arafat's leadership?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Absolutely. Arafat is the leader of a revolution that has
targeted Zionist Jews, Israelis and others who have supported the continued
persecution and obliteration of Palestinian civilian life in Palestine since
the founding of Israel 50 years ago this May.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But, to single out Arafat without acknowledging the killings
of Palestinians by Israelis and Jews is morally wrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians have been murdered and continue to be brutalized
by Jews in Israel. Israel deserves the same measures of guilt and condemnation
as have been heaped upon Arafat, who has dedicated his life to restoring
the rights of Palestinians. Rights denied to them by Jews in Israel!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before Arafat even considers visiting the Holocaust Museum,
Netanyahu might consider visiting the remains of Deir Yassin, which symbolizes
for all Palestinians one of the most heinous of crimes by the Jewish people
against the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If we are talking about compassion, that is a good place
for most Israelis to start.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>How the Day was Won? </FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Muneer Shafiq*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was inevitable for the agreement between the Iraqi government
and Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the U.N., to include a clause binding
Iraq to the implementation of Security Council resolutions against it. Also
inevitable was opening up for inspection all sites including Presidential
Palaces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After all that was requested of Iraq by almost all Arab
and Islamic states, and by the superpowers leaning Iraq-wise in the crisis
like Russia, China, and France. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither was Iraq opposed in principle to inspection even
as it prevented UNSCOM's team into the Palaces! Rather it was clear from
the start that inspection was negotiable if Kofi Annan and the majority
of the Security Council would go along with proposed Iraqi changes to inspection
teams, and with the setting of some kind of conception as to ending the
state of siege once the inspections are through.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Inspections then would be conducted within a definite time
frame even under any maximum limit..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why the U.S. government's battle revolved diplomatically
speaking around depriving Iraq from that element.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence the essence of the American position has been to
dominate inspection teams and to totally forfeit decision-making especially
with regards to whence inspections are to be declared finished. With the
ill-intention of leaving the sanctions indefinitely in place, this malicious
policy has thus far driven UNSCOM's inspection efforts for the last seven
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore 1)the participation in inspection teams of other
members of the Security Council giving them a supervising and chaperoning
role, 2) adjusting the structure of those teams, and 3) the implicit promise
thereof of lifting sanctions when the work of the born-again teams is over,
all in all represents a political defeat for U.S. foreign policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. Administration might try to sweep that defeat
under the rug by arguing that its demand of unrestricted access to all sites
has been achieved. Yet nothing can be more indicative of the truth of that
defeat more than U.S. Administration insistence that it reserves the right
to reject the Iraq-UN deal and to strike Iraq unilaterally even before Secretary
General Annan has had the opportunity to take the agreement to the Security
Council; doing otherwise be tantamount to conceding diplomatic defeat before
Arab and Islamic states, and before Russia, China, and France.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>True the scale of the defeat was relatively small! But
with far-reaching and meaningful implications for the international balance-of-power
nevertheless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But if the U.S. Administration didn't accept its diplomatic
defeat, it would then make a more grievous mistake by entering a war alone
without counting even on British support, or with British reservations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Striking Iraq or entering a war in the midst of such international
isolation, and in the shadow of the confirmed deal between the UN and Iraq
would however make political defeat more certain and more macabre than simply
backing off by agreeing to the UN-brokered deal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why Iraq did good by reaching that agreement with
Kofi Annan...</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Sex, Lies And The U.S. Initiative</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ghada Khouri*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The latest U.S. initiative to revive the stalled Middle
East peace process was overshadowed by the allegations against President
Bill Clinton of an affair with a former White House intern. As Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat sat across Clinton following their meeting last month,
members of the press were eager to ask the American President about the
alleged affair. Television news that night carried his defensive response
as a lead story, while the substance of the meeting with Arafat took the
back burner. The sex scandal engulfing the Clinton White House is paralleled
with a Mideast initiative, which seems to be bearing little fruit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During his visit to Washington, Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu remained firm on his pre-conditions for any further Israeli moves
to put the peace process back on track, while Arafat painstakingly tried
to impart upon the American public the Israeli government's continued violations
of signed agreements. The American Administration found itself stuck in
the middle, still refusing to publicly admonish Israeli intransigence while
making its dissatisfaction known in its treatment of Netanyahu in private.
Clinton first snubbed the Israeli Prime Minister in November when he refused
to meet with him as he visited American Jewish leaders. Again this week,
the White House was unusually cold in its reception, with no special public
appearances or shared meals between the two leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These unusual personal snubs come as a result of Netanyahu's
lack of cooperation with a U.S. effort to revive peace talks that ground
to a halt since the Israeli government approved the construction of a Jewish
settlement on Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arab East Jerusalem. An Israeli redeployment
from the West Bank scheduled to take place last March is nowhere in sight.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rather than present a plan for a &quot;credible&quot; withdrawal,
as requested by the United States, Netanyahu did not offer any percentages.
Prior to his arrival in Washington, the Israeli Cabinet imposed 50 specific
measures to be taken by the Palestinian leadership before any further redeployment
is carried out, including cracking down on extremists, eliminating most
of the Palestinian National Covenant, and reducing the size of the Palestinian
police force. The Israeli Cabinet's decision could in fact stall any further
pullbacks indefinitely by citing Palestinian non-compliance to its stringent
demands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu justified his government's position by underscoring
Israeli security concerns. &quot;I cannot think of peace without security,&quot;
he said. &quot;As long as we have undemocratic regimes around us, the only
peace that will hold is a peace that can be defended, and we insist on those
defenses.&quot; Among his principal demands is the annulment of sections
of the Palestinian Charter calling for Israel's destruction. The Palestine
National Council voted in 1996 to repeal several sections of the Charter,
which were spelled out in a letter Arafat brought with him to Washington.
The White House clearly accepted the letter as a formal recognition of the
Palestinians' acceptance of Israel's right to exist. But Netanyahu remained
adamant about his demand that further action be taken to formalize the annulment.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu was equally insistent on Palestinian steps to
&quot;fight terrorism.&quot; He criticized the Palestinian Authority for
adopting what he calls a &quot;revolving door&quot; policy, whereby Palestinians
accused of involvement in &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; against Israel are
jailed, then released before carrying out their sentence. Arafat denied
the existence of such a policy and accused Netanyahu of using the security
issue as an excuse to renege on Israeli obligations. &quot;It's obvious
that Mr. Netanyahu's interest is not in reaching and concluding an agreement
on security, because he wants to use security as a pretext and as an excuse
for his non-compliance with what was agreed upon,&quot; Arafat said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. strategy is now focused on addressing concerns
on both sides by encouraging security cooperation and an Israeli troop withdrawal
from unspecified West Bank areas. Under the Oslo agreements, Israel is mandated
to carry out three further redeployments from the West Bank, to be completed
by mid-1998. Netanyahu's tactic is to get away with one modest withdrawal
and jump into final status talks, thus avoiding a substantial pullback acceptable
to the Palestinians. The Clinton Administration has reportedly requested
a two-digit withdrawal plan of at least 10%, but Netanyahu has refused to
make any promises. Arafat, on the other hand, stated that the Palestinians
expect to gain control over more than 90% of the West Bank before proceeding
with final status negotiations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu left little doubt as to his government's intention
to hold on to as much of the West Bank as possible. He argued that the conquest
of the West Bank during the 1967 Six-Day War created a secure buffer between
Israel and its Arab neighbours by establishing a physical wall between Israel
and &quot;any potential invader&quot; from the Arab world. &quot;If you
ask us to withdraw from that wall, we know the whole peace process would
collapse, because Israel would revert again to a narrow band along the Mediterranean
that will invite aggression and a future conflict,&quot; he said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu has not only resisted U.S. calls to produce an
acceptable plan for troop withdrawal, but he has also rebuffed a U.S. request
for a &quot;time-out&quot; on further Israeli settlements. &quot;In Oslo,
there is no limitation on settlement activity, even the creation of new
settlements,&quot; he said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's unyielding stand is partly shaped by his government's
slim hold on power since the resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy
earlier this month and the withdrawal of his Gesher faction from the governing
coalition. With a remaining 61-vote majority in a 120-seat Parliament, the
Israeli government is now controlled by a powerful right that refuses to
cede land to the Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu used these domestic constraints as a card to
justify his resistance to U.S. pressure. The support he is receiving from
the evangelical right and members of Congress has helped strengthen his
hand in dealing with the Clinton administration. Several pro-Israel members
of Congress, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House International
Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, and Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, have strongly criticized President Clinton
for giving Netanyahu the cold shoulder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the eve of his meeting with Clinton, Netanyahu addressed
representatives of the Christian right, including evangelical leader Reverend
Jerry Falwell, who pledged to actively encourage his constituents to oppose
the ceding of land to the Palestinians. Falwell is one of President Clinton's
most zealous critics. However, the television preacher's credibility runs
low among the mainstream American public, which sees him as a right-wing
leader bent on sensationalism. Through his television programme, Rev. Falwell
is currently selling a far-fetched videotaped account accusing President
Clinton of involvement in drug- dealing and the assassination of political
opponents. Netanyahu's association with Falwell, which angered the White
House and some American Jewish groups, is indicative of the close ideological
affinity between Zionist Christians and conservative Jews. Many evangelical
Christians believe that Israel is a nation promised to the Jews by God and
that the gathering of Jews in Israel will usher in the second coming of
Christ. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat dealt with a controversy of his own upon his arrival
in Washington. He was invited, uninvited, then re-invited to visit the Holocaust
Museum, a federal institution honouring the victims of the Nazi Holocaust.
The invitation generated a polemic among Jewish groups, with some opposing
his visit while others welcomed it as a positive step toward reconciliation.
Arab critics, on the other hand, felt Arafat's visit was inappropriate at
a time when he was expected to focus on Israeli violations of Palestinian
rights. A visit to the Museum would have signalled an overture to Israel
at a time wconciliatory moves on Israel's part are not forthcoming. In addition,
it would have implied acceptance of the moral justification for the State
of Israel, namely to create a safe refuge for Jews around the world. Arafat
managed to avoid the controversy by stating that he accepted the invitation,
but that his schedule did not allow him to carry out the visit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Besides the various controversies surrounding the three
main players in the Mideast peace process, the Washington initiative underscored
the intransigence of the Israeli government and mounting U.S. dissatisfaction
with Netanyahu's tactics. Clinton attempted to exhibit a greater degree
of even-handedness after being repeatedly criticized by Arab leaders for
a hitherto timid response to Netanyahu's provocative policies. He stated
that U.S. efforts are centred on bridging the gap between Israel's security
concerns and Palestinian aspirations. In a significant recognition of Palestinian
national rights and a reiteration of U.S. commitment to the land-for-peace
formula, Clinton stressed the need to address both peoples' concerns &quot;so
that Israelis can live in security, recognized by all their neighbours,
and the Palestinians can realize their aspirations to live as a free people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. government's next step is to attempt to set up
a meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat in the next few weeks in order to
revive direct negotiations between the two sides. As of now, the unravelling
sex scandal, which has led some media analysts to prematurely doubt the
very survival of the Clinton presidency, is playing in Netanyahu's favour.
Whether Clinton will manage to keep up the heat on Netanyahu while keeping
the lid on the Lewinski affair could affect his credibility and effectiveness
in reviving a peace process on the brink of total collapse. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel: shielding abusers with immunity</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A well-known Israeli columnist Mosheh Negbi once wrote
during the first anniversary of the Intifadah (uprising) that &quot;the
Intifadah has destroyed completely the Israeli claims that it is one of
the few countries in the world that respects the International Declaration
for human rights, not just theoretically but practically as wellalmost every
procedure taken by Defense Minister Rabin to break up the Intifadah contradicts
with the principles of the International Declaration.&quot; This stigma
on the Israeli government's record seems to have become permanent over the
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The latest draft law submitted to the government organizes
the work of the Interior Security Force, Shin Bet. The law also outlines
the basic rules for the government and Knesset supervision over the performance
of Shin Bet, as well as the mechanisms for appointing the senior staff and
directors. This draft law, which was approved by the Supreme Court, would
give complete immunity to Shin Bet officials and would openly allow the
use of &quot;moderate physical pressure&quot; while interrogating a prisoner.
This loosely worded law, by virtue of its non-specificity, allows interrogators
to use methods such as hooding and sleep deprivation combined with painful
posture positions. One can understand why the draft law passed, especially
when one also knows that Shin Bet officials, who are directly connected
to the Prime Minister, can go beyond the use of &quot;moderate physical
pressure&quot; when a suspect under interrogation is a so-called &quot;time
bomb&quot;, or in other words has information on an operation under preparation.
The law, which was widely condemned by human rights organizations all over
the world and described as a &quot;green light&quot; for the use of torture
by Amnesty International, makes Israel &quot;the only country in the world
known to permit explicitly the use of torture for purposes of interrogation,&quot;
said Amnesty in a report criticizing the Israeli government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel has more than gone beyond the limits of its discriminatory
policies. Its acts are becoming worse by the day and its lack of response
to outside criticism have allowed its long-standing bias attitudes to leak
into its judicial system and even to some human rights groups. For instance,
during its annual meeting last month, the Federation for Human Rights decided
to discontinue the membership of the Israeli Committee for Human Rights,
accusing it of being bias and of being influenced by the government, thus
raising doubts about its credibility and the reliability of its reports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ironically, at the same time that the draft law was submitted
to the government, the Supreme Court was considering the case of two Palestinian
prisoners subjected to torture during interrogation. As recently as a few
months ago, the Israeli Ministry of Justice drafted a law that would exempt
the State of Israel and its security forces from tort liability for bodily
injury and wrongful death of Palestinians during the period of the Intifadah.
In other words, the Ministry of Justice was seeking to receive full exemption
from the responsibility of killing some 1,000 Palestinians and injuring
around 18,000 others. If this takes place, the Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza would no longer be able to seek compensation in Israeli courts
from Israeli security forces or from the State for any bodily injury or
wrongful death having occurred between 8 December 1987, when the Intifadah
broke out, and 13 September 1993, the date of the signing of the Israeli-PLO
Declaration of Principles. Human Rights Watch said in its report regarding
this matter, &quot;the proposed bill should be abandoned because it violates
international human rights standards in several ways. First, it undermines
the ability of victims of human rights abuses to seek fair compensation,
a right that is enshrined in various instruments. Second, the proposed law
is blatantly discriminatory in that it applies to Palestinians but not to
Israeli citizens or permanent residents or tourists. Third, the proposed
law would also narrow the range of acts for which compensation may be sought
so as to disqualify many victims of wrongful injury from seeking damages.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In spite of the record of multiple gross human rights violations,
one can't help but wonder how come this shameful record is always able to
slip out of the spotlight of Western politicians? By remaining in the shadows,
it has managed to secure not only full support of the West, but also generous
loans, donations and funds. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu unveils his security map: Toward
a greater Israel</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Dr. Daoud A. Abdullah*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After weeks of playing hide and seek, Benyamin Netanyahu
has finally decided to unveil his secret security map. It contains few surprises
and considerably even fewer assurances. As expected, he has offered a minimal
6%-8% withdrawal from the occupied West Bank, leaving the Palestinians with
approximately 40% of the total area, including the Gaza Strip. A cursory
glance at the mysterious map illustrates that Netanyahu has no intention
of ending Israel's military occupation of the territories. On the contrary,
it demonstrates his unwavering determination to prevent, and create enough
obstacles where necessary, the emergence of an independent Palestinian State
in the occupied territories with Jerusalem as its capital. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Driven by a fanatical ideology, which stigmatizes the Palestinians
as an alien people, Prime Minister Netanyahu, like all his predecessors,
is at heart a devout Zionist committed to the realization of a pure and
exclusive Jewish State in occupied Palestine. In certain ways, though, he
may be considered more honest than many other Israeli politicians if only
because he has never concealed his suspicion and disdain for the Oslo process.
Although the Declaration of Principles (DOP) makes no clear mention of a
Palestinian State, Netanyahu nevertheless fears that the notoriously flawed
agreement may ultimately be used as a vehicle to deliver one. It is for
this reason, therefore, he decided to wreck the Oslo process by deliberately
violating Palestinian rights and sensibilities with provocative policies
such as the undermining of al Aqsa Mosque and the building of settlements
in Abu Ghneim and Ras al Amoud. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During his visit to Washington in February 1997, Netanyahu
presented a similar map to President Clinton proposing the annexation of
50% of the West Bank. Although the map contained no specific borders, Clinton
neither approved nor opposed it. One week after the meeting, Netanyahu's
foreign policy adviser at the time, Dore Gold, disclosed that the United
States no longer insists on the withdrawal to the pre-June 1967 borders.
Encouraged by the unqualified support of the United States, Netanyahu has
returned one year later to announce Israel's claim to a further 10% of the
West Bank and plans to build an additional 30,000 homes for Jewish settlers
in the territories.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Old map on new paper </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In terms of its originality and creativity, the latest
Israeli security map reflects a total lack of imagination. For although
its style and presentation may have changed, its intrinsic character conforms
to the prototype drawn up by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Yigal Allon,
in July 1967. In brief, Allon recommended the annexation of 40% of the West
Bank and half of the Gaza Strip. He also called for an Israeli security
belt 10-15 kilometres wide extending the length of the Jordan Rift and the
establishment of an autonomous framework for the Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Though never officially adopted by any Israeli cabinet
since it was first proposed, the Allon Plan has provided the basic guidelines
of negotiation for those Israelis who favoured the land-for-peace approach.
Consequently, all the subsequent Israeli plans from Dayan, Sharon and Netanyahu
have displayed one common feature. That is to create demographic and military
obstacles to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian State. They only differ
in the degree and quantity of obstacles whose varying proportion may lead
to a greater or lesser measure of autonomy but definitely not independence.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The general consensus among Israelis to remain in control
of the occupied territories was purposefully demonstrated in the January
1997 National Agreement Regarding the Negotiations on the Permanent Settlement
with the Palestinians, otherwise known as the Beilin-Eytan agreement. It
was so named after its architects, Yosi Beilin, former minister in the Rabin
government, and Michael Eytan, head of the ruling Likud parliamentary faction.
Without overstepping or deviating from the parameters drawn up by Allon,
the Beilin-Eytan agreement advances three basic propositions for the final
status of the occupied territories. The first, which proffers a relationship
of good neighbours between Jews and Arabs in the Land of Israel, is essentially
a denial of the Palestinians right to pursue a national identity. For while
making no provisions for an independent Palestinian State, it simply offers
an entity devoid of sovereign powers </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Without introducing any new or fresh ideas to resolve the
conflict, the second proposition insists on the preservation of the status
quo by granting Israel control over whatever territory that is transferred
to the Palestinian entity. In the same grudging manner, the third proposal
demands that any final agreement reached with the Palestinians must guarantee
the continued existence of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
These are the guiding principles that Netanyahu has adopted wholesale in
order to draw up his security map. By refusing to dismantle the settlements,
they altogether reaffirm the continued importance of Golda Meier's claim
that the frontier is where Jews live, not where there is a line on the map.
Hence the present occupation of 30% of the Gaza Strip serves as a gruesome
reminder of this. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In effect, the Israelis' continued occupation of the West
Bank is based not so much on the validity of their divine claim to Judea
and Samaria (their name for the West Bank), as it is rooted in their non-recognition
of the Palestinians as a people and their right to self-determination. Consequently,
the debate among themselves since 1967 was not whether to have the settlements
or not, but rather where to erect them. During the first decade of the occupation,
the Labour Party installed the infrastructure and created many of the civil
institutions needed to ensure the permanence of the settlements. And, whereas
paragraph 6 of Article 49 of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates
that &quot;the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its
own civilian population into the territory it occupies&quot;, Israel has
since 1967 built, with American assistance, over 200 settlements housing
more than 300,000 settlers in the territories. Former Minister of Defence
Moshe Dayan explained; &quot;The settlements are vital, not because they
provide security but because they allow us to keep an army in the occupied
territories.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the light of the above, one naturally may ask, by what
right can Israel continue to occupy foreign countries in defiance of international
law? Is the Jewish State not obliged to observe the law that says that an
occupying power must maintain the occupied areas in tact and unaltered without
interfering with the customary life of its people? With regard to the West
Bank and Gaza, Israeli leaders, including Shimon Peres, have tried unsuccessfully
to justify this illegal activity by attempting to equate the presence of
the settlers in the West Bank with that of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel.
Clearly the two situations are not the same since the Palestinians in Israel
are not immigrants from Europe or America; their uninterrupted and continued
residence in this land for thousands of years is incontestable. Notwithstanding,
50 years after the creation of the Jewish State in Palestine, its indigenous
people presently own less than 4% of the land compared to 93% in 1947. While
the total area of Israel is now approximately 20 million dunums, 92% of
it is totally closed to non-Jews. There are, indeed, 40 Arab villages within
Israel that the political establishment has categorically refused to recognize,
thereby denying them essential services such as water, medical care and
education. Despite the desperate official attempts to cover up the facts,
more and more information is coming to light about Israel's menacing apartheid
system and the plight of its Arab population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If past and present trends are anything to go by, the future
of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza appears just as depressing
as their compatriots behind the Green Line. The former have rementirely
unimpressed by recent calls for a Palestinian State by high-profile figures
like Yossi Beilin and Henry Kissinger. The Palestinians' lack of expectation
has been partly formed by the knowledge that the Jewish settlements would
render their State considerably divided and disconnected. Worse still, Israeli
politicians insist that any Palestinian entity should be demilitarized and
devoid of all powers over its exits, entrances and borders. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Politics and demography</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The declared intention of Israel to grant limited autonomy
to the Palestinians did not come about through recognition of their rights.
It has evidently stemmed from their concern about the security risks inherent
in absorbing a large and disaffected Arab population. Judging on the basis
of the Hebron Protocol of January 1997, any future Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank territories would almost certainly be guided by the belief
that the life of a single settler is more important than thousands of Palestinians.
For this reason, therefore, their current proposals demand that a major
town like Ramallah should remain effectively surrounded by settlers from
three sides.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In spite of such threats, demographic studies of the West
Bank and 'Greater' Jerusalem confirm that the Palestinians are still in
the majority. Their majority becomes even more conspicuous in the outlying
metropolitan sector where populous Israeli settlements are scarce. Many
policy makers in the Jewish State consequently forewarn of the dangers in
the permanent annexation of the West Bank and Gaza. Given the considerably
high Palestinian birth rate, it is expected that by the year 2000 the ratio
of Jews to Arabs in Israel and the West Bank would reach 55 to 45. Under
such circumstances Israel would altogether cease to be a predominantly Jewish
State. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Time obviously is not on the Israelis side. Faced with
rapidly decreasing options, politicians like Ariel Sharon and Benyamin Netanyahu
would, under the best circumstances, prefer forced or voluntary departure
of Palestinians to Jordan. After all, Jordan is a Palestinian State, they
argue. As early as 1989, Netanyahu had made his views clear on this subject.
According to the 19 November 1989 issue of the Jerusalem Post, Netanyahu,
then Deputy Foreign Minister, told an audience at Bar Ilan University that
the government had failed to exploit the favourable situation posed by the
Tiananmen Square massacre of June that year to carry out 'large scale' Palestinian
expulsions. With the international news media thoroughly focused on China,
the danger of mass Palestinian expulsion &quot;would have been relatively
small&quot; (M. Palumbo, Imperial Israel [London: 1990], pp.302-303). When
Netanyahu later denied these remarks, the Jerusalem Post produced a tape
recording of his speech.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The coercion of the Palestinians to accept the presence
of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza during the transitional
period was itself a bad precedent. Current attempts to allow them to exist
would inevitably create conditions that would be difficult to change in
the long term. The professed right of the settlers to maintain personal,
communal, legal and territorial ties with Israel would, for all practical
purposes, obstruct Palestinian efforts to create a sovereign State. Of course,
the issue at stake is not one of a 6%, 8% or 10% withdrawal. It is a matter
of returning captured land. In short, Palestinian independence can only
be realized by dismantling the settlements and withdrawing Israeli forces
from the area. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the final analysis, nothing has changed since the League
of Nations first recognized the Palestinians right to self-determination
on their land. In terms of population size, national identity and capacity
for self-government, they remain as qualified for membership to the United
Nations as any other member. International support for their claim to Statehood
is growing in almost every major capital of the world except Washington.
In this regard, the June 1997 call by the European Union for the right of
the Palestinians to exercise self-determination, &quot;without excluding
the option of a State&quot;, is as relevant today as it was then. Whether
the present Israeli administration chooses to bow to the pressure of its
religious fanatics or not is a matter entirely up to them. What is more
important at this stage, however, is that more voices should speak out and
say to the Israelis &quot;enough is enough&quot;. Britain's Foreign Minister
Derek Fatchett has, indeed, taken the lead by condemning the Jewish settlements
as &quot;illegal&quot; during his visit to the region last month. Though
by all means timely and welcome, Palestinians are yet awaiting further diplomatic
and political measures that would lead to the establishment of a new, just
and legal order in their troubled land. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>It's time to speak out against the Zionification
of Jordan</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Laith Shbailat*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After the Jordanian-Israeli joint manoeuvres in Aqaba and
continuous Jordanian-American-British joint military exercises with &quot;Israel&quot;,
the recent decision by Jordanian authorities to partake in American-Israeli-Turkish
manoeuvres in the Mediterranean wasn't really a big surprise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A careful observer of late and past official Jordanian
positions would reasonably conclude that they have methodically purported
to annex Jordan to &quot;Israel&quot; in the service of Zionist plans, against
Arab and Muslim ones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Understandably, joint military exercises occur essentially
between States with similar policies and a compatible military strategy
identifying similarly WHO THE ENEMY IS...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence many are those official Jordanian positions undermining
the country's standing as an Arab and Muslim State, and handing over its
prime real-estate and financial assets as well as its military, economic
and political resources to &quot;Israel&quot; and the NATO Alliance. Everything
in Jordan now is up for grabs, from companies to land, from tourist services,
including those which require shedding some of the people's dignity, to
military services, including those which require shedding some of the country's
sovereignty. It's either For Rent or it's For Sale!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet sovereignty is protected by a military credo which
identifies who the enemy is in accordance with society's sense of what is
holy and what is unclean: Jordanians who take pride in their army refuse
to be in the same trenches with Zionists, who have never been and will never
be for peace. They refuse to be in the same trenches with the Turkish army,
which is occupying Northern Iraq with our implicit approval now. And they
refuse to be in the same trenches with an American Administration, which
is actively annihilating the Iraqi people and transgressing against the
Arab nation and Islam.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some of these official Jordanian positions dragging us
towards &quot;Israel&quot; and NATO, away from our Arab and Islamic centre
of gravity, are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Adopting misleading Zionist theses such as: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>a. Islam fosters terrorism;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>b. Arabism is chauvinistic; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>c.The Palestinian National Charter is unjust towards Zionist
Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Accepting Zionism as a racist creed that discriminates
between Jews and Gentiles. For example, at the same time the Jordanian government
relinquished the right of return of Palestinian refugees, it did not request
the annulment of the Israeli Law of Return which gives any Jew in the world
the right to citizenship in our occupied Palestinian land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3. Psychologically mobilizing our armed forces against
Arab opponents of the alleged peace and ceasing all such mobilization against
Zionists, even the most extreme among them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>4. At the same time the red flag of Jordanian sovereignty
is waved in the face of Arabs and Muslims on many matters of principle,
the government concedes Jordanian sovereignty to Zionists and others as
in the following examples:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>a. Agreeing to the joint administration with &quot;Israel&quot;
of Aqaba airport in the south of Jordan;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>b. Agreeing to the joint administration with &quot;Israel&quot;
of the Jordan Valley;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>c. Agreeing to the construction of an industrial city on
Jordanian soil whose exports would be exempt from American tariffs whether
Israelis are partners in joint ventures with Jordanians or non-Jordanians,
but only if Jordanians are partners with Israelis;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>d. Allowing the two Zionist criminals who tried to assassinate

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A letter to President Clinton: An Impeachable
Lie, This Holy War</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By James Carver</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dear President Clinton,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If to honour you and your office I must tell the Truth,
then I honour you and your office by doing so. You have gone too far, Mr.
President. You are telling a treasonous, impeachable lie when you tell the
Citizens of Planet Earth that you have exhausted all diplomatic options
available concerning the killing of innocent people in Iraq. This is a lie
and I am in the process of proving it. You have also lied by omission concerning
the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. I have devoted my life to offering you and
humanity the most diplomatic construct for solving human problems probably
ever conceived yet you shun me and the solution. In doing this, you have
also violated my civil and human rights and the rights of the Citizens of
Planet Earth to good, honest, open government. You become The Enemy, Sir,
when you deny your own reality and hide behind The Law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You are about to commit the most foolish action any world
leader has ever performed. You and your administration are about to once
again teach the children of Earth that mature, responsible humans always
resort to physical violence to solve their problems. Do you not wonder why
a child picks up a gun and applies this same solution by pulling the trigger?
The bottom line is that if others don't do what you want, you kill them.
In doing so, you perpetuate the conceptual diseases causing War. Does it
really surprise you that children learn this behaviour? Killing can become
an addiction like sex and since you're new at this killing game, why not
take a lesson from history and do it like Hitler, Stalin, or Truman and
just start killing people, needlessly. I volunteer to be first. Why don't
you kill me instead of the innocent people of Iraq. They have no choice,
I do. I am no one of any importance, shunned by my own family, country and
government. Those innocent people are the same people you accused Saddam
Hussein of killing. Now, in the name of Justice(?), you are going to do
the same thing to the same people? Insane. Besides, one of these people
might develop a construct for World Peace that you will listen to. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Adult-Child President at The Crossroads turning to conventional
wisdom for help while Reality screams for The Wisdom of Love: This is our
President. A fellow human being suffering from one of the greatest conceptual
and spiritual diseases Humankind has ever seen: This is our President. A
good man doing a good job but fatally flawed: This is our President. You
now have the potential to become either a Hitler or a George Washington.
What you secretly ask God for, you now have. You ask for a way for Peace
and now it is offered to you. Are you well enough and intelligent enough
to see the answer to your prayer? Remember, Hitler self-righteously did
the same thing in the name of the same Loving God, yet this Loving God actually
taught us to love our enemy. Please see this collective conceptual and spiritual
insanity!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You, above all, have the responsibility to ensure that
what you think you know, without a shadow of a doubt, is the truth. I risk
my life to tell you that you need help and that you don't know the Truth.
The Truth heals us and enables us to sleep at night. The Truth has enabled
me and millions like me to overcome all kinds of discrimination and injustices.
The Truth, I promise, will enable you to achieve your destiny. Wake Up!
The Truth always transcends and re-shapes The Laws of Humankind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For the first time in the history of the human species
we have an opportunity to create and maintain world peace, yet you in your
diseased state cannot see it. You have been brainwashed by the conventional
wisdom of your office and government. Joseph Campbell called this conventional
wisdom &quot;Holdfast&quot;. When you embrace &quot;Holdfast&quot; you are
no longer leading us toward our collective destiny. When you become ill
with conceptual diseases, you experience a functional decrease in your intelligence,
especially your creativity. When you believe a prophecy MUST come true,
you miss the reason for the prophecy: The purpose of the prophecy is to
let you know that you have a choice. God has now given Humankind another
choice which becomes your responsibility to investigate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This has been a loving confrontation from one patient of
conceptual diseases to another. I also wish to offer my hand in friendship
and understanding.....let us help.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>British Position Against Iraq Angers European
Union</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Mohammed Jalal-Abbadi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Britain, under Mr. Blair's leadership, has geared up a
propaganda campaign (BBC World Service's second &quot;world-war&quot; style)
to say and to show that NATO, the European Union members (including the
colonial Anglo-Saxons), the Canadians and the Australians are lined up for
a twentieth century second crusade against &quot;Moslems&quot; (Muslims)
in Iraq. Mr. Blair, the European Union's current president, a position that
is rotated every six months, has arrogated upon himself the dictatorial
role of waging war on behalf of the European nations against Muslim Iraq
to remain in the good book of the Zionist terrorists in the name of the
United Nations and the pretence of 'democracy'. The Europeans have not taken
such conduct kindly at all. NATO-member Turkey was not consulted by the
Zionist clique but was rather told to line up and obey the command of the
'owners' of the United Nations Security Council, the Zionist-run USA, complained
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>European nations saw this as an exclusive Anglo-Saxon war,
an unnecessary war and an unjust war because Iraq, unlike in 1991, is not
in occupation of other people's land. Zionist terrorists, the masters of
the Anglo-Saxon ruling clique, are in occupation of other people's land,
in possession of arms of mass destruction and in violation of every United
Nations resolution; yet this illegitimate entity is never threatened with
sanctions or war using the same standard and the logic the Anglo-Saxons
are advancing now. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Britain's foreign minister, Robin Cook, who has been nesting
and mating elsewhere leaving his wife alone could not answer the question
raised in the House of Commons by the courageous Members of Parliament,
George Galloway and other MPs, as to why Israel was permitted to stockpile
arms of mass destruction and allowed to keep other people's land in illegal
occupation and not be penalized. The Europeans, Russians, Asians, Africans
and the Muslim masses are also asking the same question but neither London
nor Washington can explain the anomaly, the duplicity and double standard.
By choosing Muslim Iraq to punish, the Zionist subservient stooges in London
and Washington have exposed their own hypocrisy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Implanting the Jewess Monica in the White House, Mossad
has trapped Bill Clinton, and as such, he has no option but to obey the
command of the Zionists, otherwise they will crucify him instantly. His
life is in the hand of this Monica and he has become a hostage of the Zionist
terrorists. Mr. Blair's trouble is that if he fails to obey the command
of the Zionist terrorists, they would demand their money back, the money
the World Zionist Congress paid to purchase Muslim Palestine, the so-called
'mandatory' territory, after the British dismembered the Ottoman empire
and occupied Palestine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If any State/government is to be punished by the United
Nations for the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological arms, then
both the British and American governments have to be punished because these
two governments are the guilty parties who transferred/stockpiled nuclear,
biological and chemical arms for the Zionists and sold chemical and biological
agents to Iraq. The British and American governments did not protest (never
mind go to war against Iraq) when Saddam Hussein used British-supplied chemicals
to kill the Kurds in Iraq and Iran. Because the then-Zionist leader in Tel
Aviv said, &quot;In this war (Iran-Iraq war), we do not want any victor.&quot;
And that has been the guideline by which London and Washington have followed.
Now they want to change the goal post to suit the Zionists interests. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Blair went to America and, after having secret consultations
with the Zionists and the Americans, fixed the date of assault without bothering
to tell anything to the Europeans. This action was not only a demonstration
of sheer arrogance on Mr. Blair's part, but it was insulting for the Europeans,
who are now being bullied (like in 1991) to line up and obey the command
of the Anglo Saxons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>American foreign and defense ministers, who, because of
being Jews, are considered automatic citizens of the Zionist entity, have
been beating the war drum while trying to still the voices of sanity and
thus implying that the UN means the USA and vice-versa! It is alleged that
the twin went to Bahrain and Kuwait and demanded that both these city States
must allow their land to be used by the Zionist forces to launch their attack
on Muslim Iraq. Such open and shameless blackmailing and bullying conduct
proved beyond any doubt that to obey the command of their Zionist masters,
the Anglo-Saxon ruling oligarchy would not mind stooping to the lowest depths
that one could possibly imagine. Now they are blackmailing and threatening
the Egyptians, the Saudis and the Turks to obey their absolute command!
However, it is heartening to note that the United Nations Security Council's
permanent member, the People's Republic of China, like Russia and France,
has sent back the American defense minister empty-handed, saying, &quot;China
does not believe war would or could solve any problem.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We call upon the Muslim masses everywhere to stand up to
defend Muslim Iraq, the seat of Abbaasiyyah Khulafah, the historic cultural
capital city of Islam and the land where the honourable companions of our
beloved Prophet and his Ahl-el-Bait are buried (peace and blessings upon
them all). </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A Vibrant Palestine: Israel's Key to Longevity</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Maurice D. Harris*</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>1-2</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>A peace agreement will become possible when Israel's
leaders finally accept the truth that granting Palestinian freedom and political
independence is not a matter of Israeli altruism but an essential precondition
for Israel's security. That is the truth which Yitzhak Rabin came to understand
and which made possible the Oslo accords. Absent such understanding, even
the smallest compromise [by Israel's government] is seen as a gratuitous
gift to an undeserving adversary. That is an attitude that will not prevent
the emergence of a Palestinian state but will further damage Israel's security
interests.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-- The International Herald Tribune, December 24, 1997</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli left keeps saying this, and the right doesn't
believe. Meanwhile, as Netanyahu's government goes forward with new settlements,
Israel's security interests are further compromised. How do we know this?
Let's examine the situation more closely in order to understand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A good place to begin is with the left's basic proposition:
If Israel is to survive another 50 years, it needs to secure a viable, long-term,
two-state solution with the Palestinians. Furthermore, Israel needs to parlay
that peace with Palestine into a peace with its regional neighbours that
involves thorough economic and cultural integration and interdependence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And just to be clear, an acceptable, viable Palestine must
have at least three components: statehood, contiguous borders, and East
Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now I know that peace-based security strategies remain
counter-intuitive, and therefore need to be well-proven. So what follows
is a point-by-point explanation of why Israel's chances at reaching its
hundredth birthday without a Palestine and an interdependent relationship
with its neighbours are poor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The best political analyses of the region show that over
the next few decades:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1) American interests will favour Arab societies and economic
relationship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2) If the Israeli right wins the day, Israel will become
economically isolated by a pan-Arab/African boycott, and its economy will
deteriorate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3) Israel's nuclear deterrent will stop being a guarantee
against being invaded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>4) If the Israeli right wins the day, Israel will find
itself unable to cultivate new allies or trading partners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>5) If the Israeli right wins the day, moderate Israelis,
religiously &amp; politically, will leave in increasing numbers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>6) Anti-Semitism, rooted deeply in Christianity and Islam,
is still poorly understood, unexamined, entrenched, or openly practiced
(especially in the Muslim world). It will continue to be, and will play
a role in weakening Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To analyse each of these claims:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>1) The U.S. will shift its support from Israel to Arab
countries in the coming decades:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- During the 50s-80s, Israel's military protection from
the U.S. was primarily rooted in the U.S.'s Cold War strategy. The Cold
War is over, and now the U.S.'s allegiance is primarily based on two things:
first, the need to keep old Cold War strategic allies strong until further
confidence emerges that Russia will not revert to its old role; second,
the political and economic strength of the American Jewish community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These realities may stay in place for as long as twenty-five
more years, but an unstoppable political sea-change looms ahead. First,
this &quot;just-in-case&quot; post-Cold War alignment will cease to benefit
Israel before too long. Either the West's fear of reverting to Cold War
dynamics will subside entirely, or many other Arab countries, with greater
natural resources and larger potential markets for American goods, will
emerge as better regional strategic partners for the U.S. (somewhat akin
to the way former enemy Warsaw Pact nations are joining NATO). I will address
the waning power of the American Jewish community next.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- American population shifts will bring a decline in the
main pro-Israel lobby's Capitol Hill influence. The U.S. Arab-American population
is now at 3 million and growing rapidly. There are now about 5.5 million
American Jews, but that number is shrinking and is predicted to fall below
5 million within 10 years. The two communities are on course to &quot;switch
places&quot; in terms of numbers and influence. The Arab-American community
is also, broadly speaking, a &quot;model minority&quot;, making impressive
inroads in the small and medium business world, sending its kids to college,
and developing new relationships and markets for American goods in the Arab
and Muslim world. The main Arab-American lobby is growing in wealth, influence,
and lobbying sophistication.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Israel's religious domination by the Orthodox will damage
its American Jewish support. Slightly over half of all American Jews are
intermarrying. Already, millions of intermarried and secularly-identified
American Jews are feeling increasing alienated from Israel. Identifying
with it less and less, they will incrementally decrease their political
support and interest. Also, with each passing decade, the secular American-Jewish
population will become more removed from the memory of the Holocaust, and
more complacent with its apparent safety in the professional classes of
America. These processes will deprioritize Israel in minds of many American
Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- U.S. politics are fundamentally based on preserving and
creating an environment in which large corporations can thrive. Because
of this principle, Arab countries will become more attractive trading partners
and allies to the U.S. than Israel. Without a Palestinian state and a shared
Jerusalem, American companies will have to choose between trade with Israel
or trade with the Arab and Muslim countries of the Middle East, Africa and
Asia. This enormous block of countries offers much larger markets than Israel.
The political muscle of American Jews, while an impressive accomplishment
in the annals of the history of America's ethnic minorities, is no match
for this fundamental, ubiquitous American political force.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many American Jews will refuse to accept this truth, but
there is danger in the hubris that has clouded their judgment. Pro-Israel
lobbying has never had to swim against the full current of the global corporate
power structure, with the exception of the oil crisis of 1973. During that
period, Israel actually lost key elements of its U.S. support (U.S. arms
sales to Arab nations became quite steady in the 1970s). But even during
that period, Israel still fundamentally served the corporate hierarchy's
interests because of its Cold War positioning. What the next century presents
is different and unprecedented: a geo-political corporate scenario, emphasizing
free-trade, in which an isolated Israel would be at odds with corporate
needs on a very broad scale.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- American anti-Semitism is still a largely unaddressed
issue. Jews, while widely tolerated, are still usually thought of as less
than full Americans by the WASP majority, and are commonly thought of as
&quot;overly-privileged&quot; by Americans of colour. It is still very acceptable
in American culture for non-Jews to feel concern over the perception of
:too much Jewish influence&quot; in certain spheres-- in Hollywood, business,
the professions of medicine and law, etc. Also, because many American Christians
regard themselves as having stopped the Nazis and saved the Jews from total
annihilation, Christian religious anti-Jewish attitudes have barely been
addressed in the U.S. All of these factors combined could easily serve to
isolate American Jews and weaken American support for Israel at a time of
domestic or international crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>2) Israel's economy will deteriorate the more it is
isolated:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A 21st Century Arab/African boycott will make the economic
impact of the previous boycott seem small. This is because major Western
corporate interests-- the forces at the top of the global power hierarchy--
will be looking to Arabia and Africa as the &quot;Chinas&quot; of the next
century: new emerging markets of billions of people. This process has already
begun. Israel's tiny market will be eschewed by many corporations whose
products will not be considered in Africa and Arabia if they are trading
with Israel. Economic collapse will demoralize Israelis, along with increased
political isolation and increased 'terrorist' violence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Israel will not be able to maintain its coveted hi-tech
industries. As daily life becomes scarier and more riddled with unpredictable
violence, Israel's most talented engineers, doctors, and scientists will
leave for high-paying, peaceful diaspora opportunities. Without major natural
resources or the ability to retain its best and brightest, only the super-loyal
will stay at home. Israel's economy will become reduced to two industries:
arms and tourism. Tourism will fall off as terrorism increases and global
political isolation grows. Arms may survive and be a source of wealth, but
Israeli arms industry honchos will find themselves in the predicament of
having to sell advanced weapons to enemies, or to allies of enemies, in
order to stay profitable. These tycoons may find life easier out of the
state, along with the hi-tech folks. In any case, a small country cannot
economically survive on one industry alone.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3) Israel's nuclear deterrent will stop being a guarantee
against being invaded:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This may take fifty years, or it may have already become
true. Within 25 years, Iran and Iraq will certainly possess nuclear weapons
ready to be used. Within 50 years, surely Syria and Egypt will have this
capability, too. In fact, perhaps even the Palestinians will have a bomb.
Incredible as this sounds, once Iran has nukes, it will certainly consider
trying to get one or two to Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the following could easily happen if there is no
Israeli-Palestinian solution acceptable to Arab nations:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A nuclear terrorist will detonate a nuclear weapon in
Tel Aviv.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A Muslim religious extremist leader will decide that
in the name of God he is willing to sacrifice one or two major population
areas in exchange for nuking Tel Aviv and retaking the holy land once and
for all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A political crisis will emerge in which Israel will feel
isolated and cornered, and Israel will pre-empt with a nuclear attack on
Tehran, Baghdad, or another population centre. This will lead to a regional
nuclear &amp; unconventional weapons war. Israel would probably be destroyed
in an all-out regional nuclear war in the next century, because its enemies
will be so well-armed by then, and they would invade relentlessly because
not to would cause open revolt by their citizens.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>4) Israel will find itself unable to cultivate new allies
if it sticks with a right wing agenda:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Egyptian and Jordanian regimes will not be able to protect
their own security and long-term economic interests if Israel does not agree
to a two-state solution and a shared Jerusalem. Without Egypt and Jordan,
that leaves only Israel's economic/strategic alliances of convenience with
Turkey and Europe, but those will also likely unravel under the pressure
of the other factors. In the case of Turkey, its Muslim population and major
Muslim trading-partners will eventually not tolerate this alliance. In the
case of Europe, once Arab and Muslim potential markets emerge to the tune
of a billion consumers and growing, Israel's 5 million, comparatively affluent
citizens won't be enough of an enticement to outweigh Europe's interest
in the billion potential customers. And Europe's &quot;guilt&quot; over
the Holocaust is so thin that Israel hasn't even been able to count on German
poison gas being kept away from its enemies (re. Saddam Hussein's supplier
during the Gulf War).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>5) Moderate Israelis will leave, weakening the state's
economy, and ceding it to its religious and nationalist extremists:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- The increasing domination of the Orthodox over matters
of personal status is demoralizing to the vast majority of Israeli Jews.
More and more will leave for secular societies where they can earn good
livings with their comparatively high level of education and training, and
not have extreme difficulties with matters of divorce (for women), intermarriage,
or driving on the Sabbath.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- A declining standard of living and a rising level of
nerve-racking political tension, brought about by the events described above,
will send many Israelis abroad for good. One can already find thousands
of them in Miami, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Berkeley, and Montreal.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>6) Anti-Semitism will play a role:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- Anti-Semitism, rooted deeply in Christianity and Islam,
is still poorly understood, unexamined, entrenched, or openly practiced
and taught, especially in the Muslim world. It will very likely gel again,
possibly in response to a tragic regional episode.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>- American Jews don't see the long-term precariousness
of their situation, nor do they understand the deeply rooted functioning
of Anti-Semitism in their own society.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Ideology of 'Redeemed' Land</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel also propagates among its Jewish citizens an exclusivist
ideology of the Redemption of Land. Its official aim of minimising the number
of non-Jews can be well perceived in this ideology, which is inculcated
to Jewish schoolchildren in Israel. They are taught that it is applicable
to the entire extent of either the State of Israel or, after 1967, to what
is referred to as the Land of Israel. According to this ideology, the land
which has been 'redeemed' is the land which has passed from non-Jewish to
Jewish ownership. The ownership can be either private, or belong to either
the JNF or the Jewish state. The land which belongs to non-Jews is, on the
contrary, considered to be 'unredeemed'. Thus, if a Jew who committed the
blackest crimes which can be imagined buys a piece of land from a virtuous
non-Jew, the 'unredeemed' land becomes 'redeemed' by such a transaction.
However, if a virtuous non-Jew purchases land from the worst Jew, the formerly
pure and 'redeemed' land becomes 'unredeemed' again. The logical conclusion
of such an ideology is the expulsion, called 'transfer', of all non-Jews
from the area of land which has to be 'redeemed'. Therefore, the Utopia
of the 'Jewish ideology' adopted by the State of Israel is a land which
is wholly 'redeemed' and none of it is owned or worked by non-Jews. The
leaders of the Zionist labour movement expressed this utterly repellent
idea with the greatest clarity. Walter Laquer, a devoted Zionist, tells
in his &quot;History of Zionism&quot; how one of these spiritual fathers,
A.D. Gordon, who died in 1919, 'objected to violence in principle and justified
self defence only in extreme circumstances. But he and his friends wanted
every tree and every bush in the Jewish homeland to be planted by nobody
else except Jewish pioneers.' This means that they wanted everybody else
to just go away and leave the land to be 'redeemed' by Jews. Gordon's successors
added more violence than he intended but the principle of 'redemption' and
its consequences have remained.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the same way, the kibbutz,. widely hailed as an attempt
to create a Utopia, was and is an exclusivist Utopia; even if it is composed
of atheists, it does not accept Arab members on principle and demands that
potential members from other nationalities be first converted to Judaism.
No wonder the kibbutz boys can be regarded as the most militaristic segment
of the Israeli Jewish society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is this exclusivist ideology, rather than all the 'security
needs' alleged by Israeli propaganda, which determines the take-overs of
land in Israel in the 1950s and again in the mid 1960s and in the Occupied
Territories after 1967. This ideology also dictated official Israeli plans
for 'the Judaization of Galilee'. This curious term means encouraging Jews
to settle in Galilee by giving them financial benefits. (I wonder what would
be the reaction of US Jews if a plan for 'the Christianization of New York',
or even only of Brooklyn, would be proposed in their country) But the Redemption
of the Land implies more than regional 'Judaization' In the entire area
of Israel the JNF, vigorously backed by Israeli state agencies (especially
by the secret police) is spending great sums of public money in order to
'redeem' any land which non-Jews are willing to sell, and to primped any
attempt by a Jew to sell his land to a non-Jew by paying him a higher price.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Expansionism</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The main danger which Israel, as 'a Jewish state', poses
to its own people, to other Jews and to its neighbours, is its ideologically
motivated pursuit of territorial expansion and the inevitable series of
wars resulting from this aim. The more Israel becomes Jewish or, as one
says in Hebrew, the more it 'returns to Judaism' (a process which has been
under way in Israel at least since 1967), the more its actual politics are
guided by Jewish ideological considerations and less by rational ones. My
use of the term 'rational' does not refer here to a moral evaluation of
Israeli policies, or to the supposed defence or security needs of Israel
- even less so to the supposed needs of 'Israeli survival'. I am referring
here to Israeli imperial policies based on its presumed interests. However
morally bad or politically crass such policies are, I regard the adoption
of policies based on 'Jewish ideology', in all its different versions as
being even worse. The ideological defences of Israeli policies are usually
based on Jewish religious beliefs or, in the case of secular Jews, on the
'historical rights' of the Jews, which derive from those beliefs and retain
dogmatic character of religious faith.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>My own early political conversion from admirer of Ben-Gurion
to his dedicated opponent began exactly with such an issue. In 1956 I eagerly
swallowed all of Ben-Gurion's political and military reasons for Israel
initiating the Suez War, until he (in spite of being an atheist, proud of
his disregard of the commandments of Jewish religion) pronounced in the
Knesset on the third day of that war, that the real reason for it is 'the
restoration of the kingdom of David and Solomon' to its Biblical borders.
At this point in his speech, almost every Knesset member spontaneously rose
and sang the Israeli national anthem. To my knowledge, no zionist politician
has ever repudiated Ben-Gurion's idea that Israeli policies must be based
(within the limits of pragmatic considerations) on the restoration of the
Biblical borders as the borders of the Jewish state. Indeed, close analysis
of Israeli grand strategies and actual principles of foreign policy, as
they are expressed in Hebrew makes it clear that it is 'Jewish ideology',
more than any other factor, which determines actual Israeli policies. The
disregard of Judaism as it really is and of 'Jewish ideology' makes those
policies incomprehensible to foreign observers who usually know nothing
about Judaism except crude apologetics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let me give a more recent illustration of the essential
difference which exists between Israeli imperial planning of the most inflated
but secular type, and the principles of 'Jewish ideology'. The latter enjoins
that land which was either ruled by any Jewish ruler in ancient times or
was promised by God to the Jews, either in the Bible or - what is actually
more important politically- according to a rabbinic interpretation of the
Bible and the Talmud, should belong to Israel since it is a Jewish state.
No doubt, many Jewish 'doves' are of the opinion that such conquest should
be deferred to a time when Israel will be stronger than it is now, or that
there would be, hopefully, 'a peaceful conquest', that is, that the Arab
rulers or peoples would be 'persuaded' to cede the land in question in return
for benefits which the Jewish state would then confer on them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A number of discrepant versions of Biblical borders of
the Land of Israel, which rabbinical authorities interpret as ideally belonging
to the Jewish state, are in circulation The most far-reaching among them
include the following areas within these borders: in the south, all of Sinai
and a part of northern Egypt up to the environs of Cairo; in the east, all
of Jordan and a large chunk of Saudi Arabia, all of Kuwait and a part of
Iraq south of the Euphrates; in the north, all of Lebanon and all of Syria
together with a huge part of Turkey (up to lake Van); and in the west, Cyprus.
An enormous body of research and learned discussion based on these borders,
embodied in atlases, books, articles and more popular forms of propaganda
is being published in Israel, often with state subsidies, or other forms
of support. Certainly the late Kahane and his followers, as well as influential
bodies such as Gush Emunim, not only desire the conquest of those territories
by Israel, but regard it as a divinely commanded act, sure to be successful
since it will be aided by God. In fact, important Jewish religious figures
regard the Israeli refusal to undertake such a holy war, or even worse,
the return of Sinai to Egypt, as a national sin which was justly punished
by God. One of the more influential Gush Emunim rabbis Dov Lior, the rabbi
of Jewish settlements of Kiryat Arba and of Hebron, stated repeatedly that
the Israeli failure to conquer Lebanon in 1982-5 was a well-merited divine
punishment for its sin of 'giving a part of land of Israel', namely Sinai,
to Egypt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although I have chosen an admittedly extreme example of
the Biblical borders of the Land of Israel which 'belong' to the 'Jewish
state', those borders are quite popular in national-religious circles. There
are less extreme versions of Biblical borders, sometimes also called 'historical
borders'. It should however be emphasised that within Israel and the community
of its diaspora Jewish supporters, the validity of the concept of either
Biblical borders or historical borders as delineating the borders of land
which belongs to Jews by right is not denied on grounds of principle, except
by the tiny minority which opposes the concept of a Jewish state Otherwise,
objections to the realisation of such borders by a war are purely pragmatical.
One can claim that Israel is now too weak to conquer all the land which
'belongs' to the Jews, or that the loss of Jewish lives (but not of Arab
lives!) entailed in a war of conquest of such magnitude is more important
than the conquest of the land, but in normative Judaism one cannot claim
that 'the Land of Israel', in whatever borders, does not 'belong' to all
the Jews. In May 1993, Ariel Sharon formally proposed in the Likud Convention
that Israel should adopt the 'Biblical borders' concept as its official
policy. There were rather few objections to this proposal, either in the
Likud or outside it, and all were based on pragmatic grounds. No one even
asked Sharon where exactly are the Biblical borders which he was urging
that Israel should attain. Let us recall that among those who called themselves
Leninists there was no doubt that history follows the principles laid out
by Marx and Lenin. It is not only the belief itself, however dogmatic, but
the refusal that it should ever be doubted by thwarting open discussion,
which creates a totalitarian cast of mind. Israeli-Jewish society and diaspora
Jews who are leading 'Jewish lives' and organised in purely Jewish organisations,
can be said therefore to have a strong streak of totalitarianism in their
character.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, an Israeli grand strategy, not based on the tenets
of 'Jewish ideology', but based on purely strategic or imperial considerations
had also developed since the inception of the state. An authoritative and
lucid description of the principles governing such strategy was given by
General (Reserves) Shlomo Gazit, a former Military Intelligence commander.
According to Gazit: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot; Israel's main task has not changed at all [since
the demise of the USSR] and it remains of crucial importance. The geographical
location of Israel at the centre of the Arab-Muslim Middle East predestines
Israel to be a devoted guardian of stability in all the countries surrounding
it. Its [role] is to protect the existing</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>regimes: to prevent or halt the processes of radicalisation,
and to block the expansion of fundamentalist religious zealotry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For this purpose Israel will prevent changes occurring
beyond Israel's borders [which it] will regard as intolerable, to the point
of feeling compelled to use all its military power for the sake of their
prevention or eradication.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other words, Israel aims at imposing a hegemony on other
Middle Eastern states. Needless to say, according to Gazit, Israel has a
benevolent concern for the stability of Arab regimes. In Gazit's view, by
protecting Middle Eastern regimes, Israel performs a vital service for 'the
industrially advanced states, all of which are keenly concerned with guaranteeing
the stability in the Middle East'. He argues that without Israel the existing
regimes of the region would have collapsed long ago and that they remain
in existence only because of Israeli threats. While this view may be hypocritical,
one should recall in such contexts La Roche foucault's maxim that 'hypocrisy
is the tax which wickedness pays to virtue'. Redemption of the Land is an
attempt to evade paying any such a tax.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Needless to say, I also oppose root and branch the Israeli
non-ideological policies as they are so lucidly and correctly explained
by Gazit. At the same time, I recognise that the dangers of the policies
of Ben-Gurion or Sharon, motivated by 'Jewish ideology', are much worse
than merely imperial policies, however criminal. The results of policies
of other ideologically motivated regimes point in the same direction. The
existence of an important component of Israeli policy, which is based on
'Jewish ideology' makes its analysis politically imperative. This ideology
is, in turn, based on the attitudes of historic Judaism to non-Jews. Those
attitudes necessarily influence many Jews, consciously or unconsciously.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Diffusing the crisis between Iraq and Jordan</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Free Arab Voice*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the aftermath of the execution of four Jordanians in
Iraq for smuggling car parts, several declarations and articles in the official
press indicated that the Jordanian government's response was calibrated
to foment a crisis with Iraq leading to a shut-down of the last semi-open
Iraqi border.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jordanians, who are otherwise extremely sympathetic to
Iraq, were getting bombarded with stories of how many dozens of Jordanian
prisoners there were in Iraq, of how badly they were being treated, of how
Iraq just wasn't responding positively to official Jordanian government
pleas, of how Iraq might hold back indispensable shipments of its oil to
Jordan out of sheer spite, and of how Iraq was on a collision course with
Jordan in spite of all that which the latter has done for the former in
its dire times!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was becoming clear to many Jordanians that the Jordanian
government was coordinating with the U.S. and &quot;Israel&quot; to tighten
the squeeze on Iraqi borders in preparation for the next impending aggression
against the Iraqi people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 15 December 1997, however, Laith Shbailat, the leading
opposition figure in Jordan, sent a letter to the Iraqi Ambassador in Amman,
Jordan, in support of Iraq, but also conveying the dismay of the Jordanian
public over the Iraqi execution of four Jordanians. Explaining how this
gave conspirators the opportunity to fish in dirty waters, he requested
a meeting with President Saddam Hussein to discuss the festering situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A little more than a month later, Laith Shbailat came back
to Jordan from his meeting with Saddam with all of the 71 Jordanian prisoners
from Iraqi jails, 12 of whom are to finish their criminal sentences in Jordanian
jails. As he was held back for many hours at a checkpoint on the Jordanian
side of the border, the Jordanian prisoners made it safely through into
the capital Amman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jordanian government was furious at the release of
the Jordanian prisoners outside the usual channels, but Laith Shbailat revealed
that official Jordanian requests to release the prisoners were rude and
patronizing, calculated specifically to illicit a negative Iraqi response,
which is why he succeeded where the government didn't.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Either way, the release of the Jordanian prisoners from
Iraq, many of whom committed criminal offenses for which they deserved to
serve time, succeeded in diffusing a pre-fabricated crisis with Iraq, thus
depriving the forces of evil from the excuse and the popular support to
further besiege Iraq. This time the good people won!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another happy ending: Iraq offered Jordan more oil at cheaper
prices and presented Jordan with a whole oilfield on the border region,
which the Jordanian government declined to accept so as not to disobey Washington.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Still the point was made...</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Taking Aim And Buying Time</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By John Hartung*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Imagine being the Commander-in-Chief of the United States
Armed Forces (one of the many hats worn by the President). You just spent
$800 million to get three aircraft carriers and tens of thousands of soldiers
ready to attack Iraq, but you have one outstanding problem: targeting. You
are sure that you want to bomb some of the locations that you have targeted,
but you are not so sure about several others. There are a number of locations
that you suspect should be destroyed, but they have not been targeted. You
need more information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now imagine that an honourable man like Kofi Annan has
made an agreement with Saddam Hussein that could enable you to gain additional
targeting information. Should you delay your attack while U.N. inspectors
gather details that might even help you murder Saddam Hussein himself (a
definite feather in your hat)? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is a difficult decision. Keeping a massive force poised
to attack is very expensive, and the inspectors may not bring back the information
that you need, and it all takes time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ah! But wait! Taking time might be good because that dog-of-a-Special
Prosecutor is taking his time to carefully collect evidence that you compromised
your honour and dignity with a 21-year-old employee, and that you asked
her to lie. In fact, the Special Prosecutor may not make his report to your
government for another month or more. You may need to divert your country's
attention to this report reliably and suddenly in April or June. Perhaps
you should tell the world now that you are skeptical about the agreement
between Annan and Saddam, but you are willing to wait for the outcome. You
must be sure to warn the world, however, that if Iraq does not give you
everything you want, &quot;the United States would have the unilateral right
to respond at a time, place and manner of [your] own choosing&quot; (New
York Times, 24 February 1998). Perfect! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is a story in the Bible about a man who forestalled
an attack on a nation so that he could set up a better attack. The story
even involves an affair with a young woman (Genesis 34:1-29):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dinah, the daughter of Leah whom she bore unto Jacob (whose
name was later changed to Israel), went out to see the women of the land.
And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw
her, he took her and lay with her and defiled her (out of wedlock). And
his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. He loved the maiden
and spoke tenderly to her. So Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying,
&quot;Get me this maiden for my wife.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah,
but his sons were with his cattle in the field, so Jacob held his peace
until they returned. Meanwhile, Hamor, accompanied by his son Shechem, went
to Jacob to speak with him about a proposition of marriage between Dinah
and Shechem. The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard of
the incident; and they were indignant and very angry, because Shechem had
wrought folly in Israel by lying with their sister, and such a thing ought
not to be done. But Hamor spoke with them, saying, &quot;The soul of my
son Shechem longs for Dinah; I pray you, give her to him in marriage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us,
and take our daughters for yourselves. You shall dwell with us; and the
land shall be open to you; dwell and trade in it, and own property in it.&quot;
Shechem said to Dinah's father and to her brothers, &quot;Let me find favour
in your eyes, and whatever you ask of me I will give. Ask of me ever so
much of marriage presents and gifts, and I will give what you ask of me,
only give me the maiden to be my wife.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father with
a plan to be deceitful because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah. They
said to them, &quot;We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who
is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. Only on this condition
will we consent to you: that you will become as we are and that every male
of your society must be circumcised as well. Then we will give our daughters
to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will dwell
with you and become one people. But if you will not listen to us and choose
to remain uncircumcised, then we will take our daughters, and we will be
gone.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem. And the young man
did not delay in fulfilling his promise because he had found delight in
Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honoured of all his family. So Hamor
and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men
dwelling therein, saying, &quot;These men are friendly with us; let them
dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough
for them; let us take their daughters in marriage, and let us give them
our daughters. Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us,
to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are
circumcised,&quot; and hence every male was circumcised. Thereafter, two
of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi (heads of 2 of the 12 tribes of Israel
and each tribe having its own army of warrior-herdsmen), took their swords
and came upon the city unawares on the third day (following the circumcision
of all the males in the city), when they were sore (from their being circumcised),
and killed all the males.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They slew Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords,
and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away. And the sons of Jacob
(all 12 tribes) came upon the slain, and plundered the city because their
sister had been defiled; they took the flocks and herds and whatever else
was in the city and in the field. All the wealth, all the little ones and
their wives, and all that was in their houses, they captured and claimed
as their booty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Bible story and the present-day situation between the
United States and Iraq are similar in that the United States is carefully
planning their strategy to defile the Iraqis, but that's where the similarity
ends. Jacob and his sons were honourable men defending the honour of their
people from a deplorable act by a man of little morals. The U.S., on the
other hand, wants to defile the people of Iraq and punish them for nothing
more than the Iraqis' right to defend their country against those who would
renege on their agreements, an act of preserving their honour for their
countrymen and in the eyes of the world&shy;a right that the U.S. claims
only for itself and for those of its choosing. The United States is prepared
to kill Iraqis for offenses that it pays Israel to commit such as the development
of weapons of mass destruction, flaunting U.N. resolutions and oppressing
indigenous minorities&shy;a blatant double standard.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a campaign speech before the Jewish leadership Council
in 1992, then-Governor-running-for-President Bill Clinton said, &quot;If
I ever let Israel down, God would never forgive me.&quot; Thomas Friedman,
the darling of liberal Zionists, wants to help Clinton avoid disappointing
Israel: &quot;The U.S. has to make clear to Iraq and U.S. allies that if
there is any violation, America will use force, without negotiation, hesitation
or U.N. approval&quot; (New York Times, 24 February 1998).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jerusalem Post has reported that &quot;Palestinians
Laud Annan Deal&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>(February 24). Perhaps it is too early to celebrate the
peace</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>negotiated by Kofi Annan. Treachery is a time-honored tradition
in</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel, and Christianity is a form of Judaism.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Pro-Iraqi Demonstrations: Arab Unity</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Middle East region is lying on the brink of great change.
According to Russia, if the U.S. starts a war with Iraq, it would then lead
to World War III. Maybe. Are Europe, Israel and the U.S. so anxious to start
a war of devastation and destruction that would lead to more poverty, destitution,
death and homelessness? War with Iraq will indeed affect the whole region.
What will the Arab countries do for their neighbouring Arab brother, Iraq?
How can they stop the Arab people from feeling sympathy for the Iraqi people?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We find Kuwait has joined America and allowed them to base
themselves in Kuwait. Turkey has also allowed their presence in their airfields.
Egypt and Syria have declined to join; yet they are not taking a strong
stand by Iraq. Neither is Jordan; it keeps reiterating a search for diplomacy
and peace and wants to hold a neutral position. Yet, some may see it as
siding with America; this is partly due to some Jordanian officials' statements
that if a war starts, then it'll be Saddam's fault. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is clear that Jordan has changed its attitude towards
peaceful demonstrations. During the Gulf war, thousands of Jordanians and
Palestinians took to the streets of Jordan in support of Iraq. Now, they
are supposed to turn away feelings of sympathy for a devastated country
that is being unjustly treated and bullied? Feelings do not turn on and
off like water faucets; they're not supposed to. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>None of the Arab governments can contain the feelings the
people have. This time, most people seem to be siding with the Iraqi people
and against bullying world powers, even though their governments may be
sending different public messages. No one wants war; even more so, no one
wants to see a massacre by the New World Imperialists. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The voices of truth, sympathy and justice cannot be contained.
Recently, pro-Iraqi demonstrations were held in the Golan Heights, in Palestinian
camps in South Lebanon, at Al-Azhar in Cairo, Egypt, in the Palestinian
cities of Ramallah, Bethlehem, and Nablus and at a camp outside of Jerusalem.
These demonstrations ended up being opposed. The second demonstration held
in the Golan Heights met with clashes from Israeli soldiers. On 13 February
1998 in Amman, Jordan, a large pro-Iraqi demonstration was held in downtown
Amman despite the government's ban on demonstrations. The people showed
their unity with their Iraqi brothers (and sisters) as they received beatings
at the hands of Jordanian soldiers, police officers and anti-riot units.
In expectation of the demonstration, the police blocked all entrances to
the downtown area from 6 o'clock in the morning. The people parked their
cars outside and walked inside to the Al-Husseini Mosque for the Friday
prayer. Police were surrounding the mosque. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After the prayer, many tried to leave but were forced back
inside. Others got out and began marching. The demonstrators were from opposition
parties and Islamic parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Ex-ministers,
political figures, lawyers and journalists were among the demonstrators.
It was supposed to be a peaceful demonstration as Mustaqbal Party leader
Suleyman Arar assured Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali. However, Majali
banned this peaceful demonstration and spared no expense at containing and
punishing the demonstrators. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The demonstrators were supposed to march to a place and
to hold speeches to support Iraq and to show they were against the U.S.
striking Iraq. However, it was cut short. According to eyewitnesses, when
the people tried to get out of the mosque, many were pushed back inside.
Some marchers got out and met soldiers holding guns, batons, tear gas canisters,
water hoses and dogs. A helicopter was hovering above them. There were about
1,000 demonstrators who began chanting &quot;By our souls and blood we will
sacrifice ourselves for Iraq.&quot; There were shouts of Allahu Akbar and
police began chasing the people. They ran. Some were beaten with batons.
Some were arrested. Some journalists were harassed, detained, beaten and
had their film and videotapes taken away. Even the reporter for the government
news agency, Petra, was beaten. Some women were there and got pushed around
and arrested. Suleyman Arar, who was also ex-Vice-Prime Minister and former
speaker of the Lower House, received a beating from the police, as did other
influential figures. Some people ended up in the hospital. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then, the police went inside the mosques with dogs and
started beating and arresting people at the pulpit. Amazing behaviour! Muslims
are told not to fight inside places of worship, meaning their enemies, unless
they are attacked first. Now, other &quot;Muslims&quot; are attacking them
in the mosque? The opposition parties have asked the government to resign.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How can the West, the Israelis and most importantly Arab
governments expect the Arab people to ignore a serious and uncalled-for
attack upon an Arab brother? The Arabs are united by blood, by language,
by history, by heritage and by religion (the majority being Muslims). They
can never cut this tie no matter how much they try to shut up the voices.
Even world Muslims are concerned. The strongest tie existing is that of
religion, for it transcends all boundaries. World Muslims are brothers/sisters
to one another, and they cannot stand by silently. Every day new demonstrations
are being held throughout the region. Another demonstration is planned to
occur in Amman. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These demonstrations started out peacefully as voices of
protest and as a means to call world attention to the unfairness of such
an attack on Iraq. Such peacefulness met with confrontation. Next time,
the demonstrators may get stronger. They will never be quiet, especially
with the expected war. They will only keep intensifying. When one finger
of the Arab/Muslim hand is injured, the rest will feel its pain.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Because America Cares!</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Anderson</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Even though we are at war, I see you as my friend</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>And just what we are fighting for I cannot comprehend&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is very unlikely that U.S. President Bill Clinton cares
more about the Iraqi people than they do themselves. Furthermore, it is
difficult to believe that the massive American build-up in the Middle East
is to protect other countries in the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>America, led by Zionists in America and in Great Britain,
is bent on completely destroying the Iraqis' delicate infrastructure in
order to please the Zionist State of Israel. As well as permanently crushing
Iraq militarily, any air strike would be disastrous for the Iraqis who have
already suffered tremendously from the sanctions as well as the most horrific
bombardment in the history of mankind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is a form of subjugation and slavery. The ultimate irony
is that not only will it make Americans less popular and more hated, but
also that only Iraq is being singled out to rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction when other countries, such as Israel, are armed up to the hilt
and have nuclear reactors as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How can Clinton claim that it is because he cares about
the Iraqi people that he wants to bomb them? What kind of care is this?
Hasn't enough damage already been done? How many more Iraqi babies must
die so that Clinton can prove that he cares? He makes a good version of
a modern-day Hitler in his efforts at mass genocide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And it is not just the idea that Iraqi people are dying,
for at least they are freed once and for all from the miserable conditions
that plague all the rest of the surviving population. The idea is that the
suffering lags on from one day to the next and that hopelessness and despair
are everywhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another perplexing thought is just what business is it
of America to decide who should and who should not possess weapons of mass
destruction? Should we fool ourselves into believing then that this world
police force is out to preserve democracy and freedom around the globe?
If this were the case, then why are the Palestinians living in Diaspora
while the Israelis are confiscating more and more Palestinian land every
day? And why is it that America always seems to support third world countries
that have tyrannical governments that subdue their people through fear?
It is obvious that such tyrants are kept in power so that the masses will
never unite and so that injustice will be enforced and greed and evil prevail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Peace Process (the master plot of the Americans and
Israelis) has not brought peace to the Middle East at all nor has it brought
the economic prosperity that was promised. Instead, the cost of living has
soared, and the people are more impoverished than ever while their greedy
leaders live lives of unimaginable luxury requiring whole armies just to
sustain them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let's face it, killing Iraqis is profitable for the U.S.
for it totally destroys a once mighty nation and provides Americans with
a steady supply of oil. Why shouldn't every 100 Iraqi babies die just so
that 1 American can be sure to have a warm house in the winter and a tank
full of gasoline?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Had the Americans really wanted the Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein killed, they could have done this quite successfully during operation
Desert Storm. What is really sad is that for some strange reason, the average
man on the streets of America has stopped asking why and blindly accepts
whatever is fed to him through the various forms of propaganda.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Peace right now in the Gulf if very precarious. The massive
troop build-up is not only intimidating but costly to the gullible American
public as well. Even if Saddam did have biological and chemical weapons,
what does this mean to the Americans? It is hardly likely that Iraq has
any substantial weapons to defend itself, much less wage biological warfare.
At this moment, there might be a temporary peace in the Middle East, but
who knows what new and shallow demands America will next issue forth to
a people who have already endured much more than is conceivable.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Honouring African Americans</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Fazeel Aziz Chauhan*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>February is Black History month and it serves as a great
reminder of the immense contributions that African Americans have made to
this society. Their teachings can profoundly help and accelerate the progress
of Pakistanis and other Muslims in America. The extreme degree of their
human experience and their devout legacy deserves tremendous honour. We
need to thank all minorities who came before us. They have given their lives
for obtaining Civil Rights for our children. They can teach us immensely
if we are willing to be humble and accept that we have a common milieu.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If we as Muslims want to become aware of our predicament,
we must begin by getting an accurate picture of American history. The book
&quot;A People's History of the United States&quot;, by Howard Zinn, is
compulsory reading. It will shock you with the truth from page one. Native
Americans were already here for thousands of years before the Europeans
such as Columbus arrived in the New World. Ironically, Columbus was actually
looking for India, to enslave my own ancestors. Zinn's book quotes Columbus'
own journal about his intentions of importing slaves and gold to Europe.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Historically, there has always been a small group of people
exploiting a much larger group that may be poor, weak or non-white. We must
be aware of the idea that the media defines and divides the world into the
categories of &quot;the West and the Rest&quot;. In the scheme of American
definitions, we are classified as minorities. We are included in the groups
of Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and immigrants.
We should join the ranks of our fellow minorities and do our fair share.
If united, this group of &quot;minorities&quot; can be very powerful. Otherwise
we fall prey to being divided and conquered by other people. The people
classified as &quot;minorities&quot; in America can teach each other astronomically
because we share most common values. We may have different religions, but
our culture, morals, behaviour and predicament are the same as native or
traditional people of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The legacy and teachings of Native Americans also deserves
tremendous honour. The first owners of this land are classified as a &quot;minority&quot;
who did not &quot;immigrate&quot; to America. The first &quot;non-Europeans&quot;
who immigrated here, but against their will, were Africans. It is guaranteed
that their words will enlighten you. Their experience will help you progress
much faster. We are not the first minority or the first immigrants here.
Africans have been here for hundreds of years before us. We should always
enlist their help and cooperation so that we do not have to keep re-inventing
the wheel. Thus we need to appreciate and honour them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If you are facing racism, ask an African American about
the experience of his ancestors. If you feel that you are among aliens,
watch movies like &quot;Amistad.&quot; Invite an African American family
over for dinner and engage in a dialogue about your common issues. Their
heart, hope, persistence, faith, humbleness, pride and power will invigorate
and catapult you. In addition to dialogue, read books written by African
Americans and other minorities. Get beyond only watching movies such as
Malcolm X. Find out who struggled for hundreds of years, bit by bit, to
get equal rights for &quot;people of color&quot;. As a rule, any dominant
culture tries hard to maintain the status quo. It wasn't Anglo-Americans
who initiated the ideas of Civil Rights against slavery, apartheid and racism.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our Muslim parents push their kids to pursue careers which
are only financially rewarding such as business or medicine. Why should
it take five more decades to realize that we need to encourage kids to pursue
the arts, politics and social work? The Jewish people are a great example
of a small group of people who became very influential by teaching their
kids to go into the powerful areas of media, politics and finance. We should
learn from them. Your children can be the next heroes for people around
the world, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Mohammed Ali. African Americans
are usually the best athletes but why are they prevented from being coaches?
The best Cricket, Squash, Kabaddi and Hockey players in the world are in
our genes. Why do we keep them dormant? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>White supremacists continue to use IQ tests and various
studies to prove that other minorities somehow lack certain human elements.
But look at how African Americans prove them wrong by their accomplishments
in science, as well as arts. Louis Lattimer is a famous scientist and inventor.
African American scientists are not well publicized but artists will tell
you that even art involves high mathematical and scientific abilities. Notice
that often Anglo-Americans are made legendary by the media while minorities
are ignored. For example, the notion that &quot;Elvis is King&quot;. What
about Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis and Jimmy Hendrix? African
Americans are the pioneers of pop music. They sang gospel and the blues
from the time of slavery and later invented the highly complex style called
jazz. Actors churn up their ancestral emotions and deliver heart-wrenching
performances in the theatre. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some of our Muslim brethren look down upon other sects.
But any human being that claims that he is a Muslim probably shares at least
70% of your beliefs. So why not joyfully embrace him for that? Us Pakistanis
have the common disease of pointing the finger at others and being unable
to see that the other three fingers are always pointing at us. The Nation
of Islam has done a lot of revolutionary and brave work. Most Anglo-Americans
believe the trash on TV and don't even know who is Allah or Mohammed. If
a group of people like the Nation of Islam, or whoever, can teach someone
about the basics of Allah, Mohammed and the Qur'an, then each student receives
thousands of benefits. Instead of dividing people based on our differences,
and judging other groups, we should accept them for being like us. Which
Muslim group will organize the next Million-Man March?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We also import prejudices from the old country where human
supremacy based on skin color and money is rapidly becoming common. We need
to be aware of how beautifully these lies are fed around the world through
the TV and movies. African Americans and Muslims are portrayed as criminals
and sub-human. Caucasians are portrayed as admirable heroes, even if they
are shown as killers. Some churches that present Jesus as a White man subtly
give the message that Caucasians are Godly and can do no wrong. Immigrants
like us were lucky enough to have experienced life in other environments.
We are very perceptive and can also in return be good teachers. These statements
are not meant to be Anti-Anglo; they are human beings like the rest of us,
but no race or skin is superior. The extreme of unity is Allah. The benefit
of human unity is that we can teach each other and together greatly accelerate
our progress.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Amer the Imbecile</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shadows of the deserted night cautiously tiptoed around
the dimensions over the large mountain square. Rough winds swept gnarled
trees and bent them over further in an easterly direction while small bushes,
still rooted firmly in the hard ground, held their positions. The gray cement
and stone houses guarded the square with shuttered windows and owners who
had at last retreated to their beds, surrendering themselves to slumber.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sidewalks (kept immaculately clean from continuous efforts
by the city's orange-uniformed workers) resounded the lone footsteps of
a man known as Amer the Imbecile. The silence of the night was broken by
his voice booming in a solo conversation. &quot;You'll never learn. How
many times have you had the chance to improve yourselves, yet remain the
same,&quot; he complained. His round body ambled along against the wind,
flapping his loose jacket and trousers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whenever Amer begged for bread, he was fed a meal. Whenever
he asked for water, he was given yogurt. At intervals he was given odd jobs
to do by various merchants whose shops sat on or near the square. He stomped
through the neighbourhoods, now a beggar, now a captain, usually holding
complete conversations with invisible associates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Curious folks often inquired, &quot;Where do you come from?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I come from nowhere,&quot; or, &quot;I come from
everywhere,&quot; he would reply.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So he became known as feeble-minded and given odd jobs
sweeping out stores and carrying sacks of goods here and there. His demands
were simple and no one refused him. Feared by some, laughed at by others,
he dwelt in a realm somewhere between reality and insanity. Voices from
his heart or mind would speak to him and he would answer, striking up a
conversation with himself wherever he was at the time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On this particular night, some policemen unfamiliar with
the square and the surrounding neighbourhood, stopped Amer as he shouted
to himself. &quot;Who are you?&quot; they asked him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;My name is Amer and I'm from the Akl family. I live
over there,&quot; he pointed, &quot;under the stairway of my family's house.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The police questioned the Akl family about Amer and were
told, &quot;No, he isn't a member of our family, but we feel sorry for him,
so we let him sleep under our stairs at night. He's an idiot, you know,
and harms no one.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amer's incoherence and remoteness further convinced them
that he was indeed an imbecile and better left alone. The policemen jumped
back in their car and sped away. Continuing his journey, Amer plodded on.
The night dew was fresh on his tongue and its moisture wet his face. He
stooped down to catch a flying paper and stuffed it into his black trash
bag where he hoarded his cache of treasured rubbish, all the while bickering
with himself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He didn't know why he was out in the middle of the night
talking to himself. They had told him to come and their voices had guided
him. They spoke to him from the gnarled trees and from the shrubs. They
spoke to him from distant winds. It was they who ordered him to gather precious
flying papers, and it was their invisible voices whispering from his heart
to &quot;put</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>more fuel on the fire. There are discarded clothes and
wood to burn lodged under some rocks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So he dug for them with his hands and dirt from the soil
crept in under his fingernails to add to the dirt already stored there.
He stumbled over to the fire and threw his find on the flames, nearly smothering
them. Black wisps of smoke rose in curled clouds and filled Amer's nostrils
and filtered into his nose and throat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Satisfied, he sat on some rocks nearby as the fire gained
strength. He answered the voice in his heart and said, &quot;I keep cleaning
after the cattle that throw their rubbish in the streets and homes of ghosts.
But they never did listen. My work never finishes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When the fire finally died down, the imbecile sat confused.
He scratched his head and looked at his toes peeping out at him from ragged
shoes. He would wait for the voices to tell him what to do next. The chill
of the night gnawed at his bones but he was unheeding. He looked up to the
sky and found night was giving way to light. He inhaled deeply and let the
air of the new dawn enter his lungs. He swallowed. The taste of the new
day was fresh in his mouth and he smiled again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the voices returned and spoke to him, fighting, teasing
and bullying him. Once more his voice rose in protest, &quot;I swear by
God that no one, no one ever listens to me. I'm an important person. My
work is endless, yet you keep bothering me. Go and disturb someone else
for a change.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And he continued to speak to himself in a loud voice as
the winds pushed and pulled at him and blew his hair in different directions.
At length, after many hassles, he returned to his cold shelter under the
stairs of the merchant Akl, who kindly let him sleep there. He flung himself
down on a worn blanket and slept like a baby until he was awakened again
by rustling voices living in his heart, his mind, or grew out of the windblown
trees and shrubs. Soon he would awake with pangs of hunger grinding in his
stomach. Then he would scrounge once more for food.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No one knows why Amer degenerated into a mentally handicapped
person. Some say that he wasn't always that way. At one time he had a good
job, wore a suit and was respected by all. But somehow, some kind of misfortune
struck him that warped and destroyed his mind and now he lives at the mercy
of others while his mind pulls him in different directions and he is confused,
frustrated, without a home and tragically alone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps, if you pass Amer's square in the deep of the night
when shadows tiptoe among the trees and the winds whisper strange secrets,
you will hear Amer the Imbecile fighting with his invisible voices locked
in his own world, completely out of touch with everyone and everything.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Poem: My Poor Arab!</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By S. Norashkharian</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>My poor Arab! The abused child of the world!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The darkest clouds blown by the winds of the West</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Have cast shadows upon your land once again...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Who knows this time which of your sons will they claim?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Which of your towns will vanish with keyboard strokes</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And how many friends will you search for in vain?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And how much blood, how much blood will they vomit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Flooding your streets and your bedrooms once again?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>O my brother, where will you now hide from them?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They call themselves civilized...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet their warplanes will very soon reappear</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With blue and red and white colors marked on them</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And fifty stars boasting their crimes without shame...!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Soon they will creep into your space once again</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Invisible, like the fingers guiding them</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Raping! Raping! The virgin face of your skies</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chasing your nights away with their blinding fires</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And bomb by bomb and shell by shell tearing down</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All that you built stone by stone and breath by breath...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They call themselves civilized...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>O, my brothers, close your eyes and plug your ears!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No! Do not wait for what your dawns will unveil!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For their terror will make you hope for the nights</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Which are trapped in the black holes of collapsed stars...!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No! Do not wait for the yellow dust of death</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To clear away from the limbs spread everywhere</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Like the remnants of your defiled dignity...!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And do not wait for your mothers to stumble</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Upon the charred shoes their children left behind...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They call themselves civilized...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet these bullies will trade your blood for your oil</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And the blood of their sons for their bank accounts...!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So let us pump your black liquid down their throats</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Until they gasp like ducks caught in their oil spills</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And while it flows in the veins and tentacles</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of their global conglomerates and World Banks</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let us burn it! Let us burn it with revenge!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For they built them to rule our fate with blood</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And they bred them to squeeze our lungs like pythons...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They call themselves civilized...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where is your voice, where is your voice my brother?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where is your voice and why is it lost again</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the uproar of lynching mobs which exclaim:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Entertain us, entertain us now or else!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If you have no more scandals give us wars!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where is your voice and how is it missed again</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By armies of reporters with satellites?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And which court ruled that you deserved punishment</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For suffering the curse of your own tyrant?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They call themselves civilized...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Allahu Akbar!&quot; You cry from your minarets</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Bism Illahi El Rahman ou El Rahim!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And you bow down like a zebra caught by the throat</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And accept your Allah's will with frozen eyes</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While the High Priests debate your fate in Councils</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Which they have made to legalize their vile deeds...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>O, the High Priests and the nations they butchered!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Five times a day you accept your Allah's will</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>My dear brother, how will you now accept theirs?</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They call themselves civilized...!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Walk with me now beyond borders drawn for us</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And beyond the deserts where we lived like ghosts</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Without footprints and without a signature</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And beyond all of the fountains where our lips</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Blistered with thirst which could never become quenched</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And let us leave forever all the cities</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where our conscience became a clown wearing rags</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Come with me now with a shovel and a rose</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let us bury a century of coffins...!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Only my soul hears your scream...!</FONT></P>
