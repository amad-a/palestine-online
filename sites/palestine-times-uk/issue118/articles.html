<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Couldn&#146;t Zionism lie about the holocaust,
too?</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Khalid Amayreh</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a Palestinian who has lived virtually all his adult life under
Israel&#146;s nefarious military occupation, I can testify that Zionist leaders, academics
and propagandists are actually professional practitioners of mendacity as much as they are
of murder and bloodshed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, from over 35 years of observing and monitoring Israeli-Zionist <i>hazbara</i>
(propaganda) both in Israel and the United States, I could safely conclude that everything
and anything said or written by the official Israeli-Zionist establishment, whether on
Palestinian refugees or on &#147;the only democracy in the Middle East&#148; or, indeed,
on &#147;the&#148; holocaust, should be thoroughly doubted and questioned, for Zionists
are pathological liars and they should be treated as such until proven otherwise.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Israel&#146;s infamous and nefarious lies about the Palestinian
plight and her continued misrepresentation of truth and reality about her genocidal
torment of the Palestinian people, which transcends reality, should force all
truth-seekers to think a hundred times before giving any Zionist story or narrative the
benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lying, of course, is not confined to Zionist Jews, and nobody can claim
that mendacity is an exclusively Jewish-Zionist monopoly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, unlike the world&#146;s other lying murderers, the big lie in the
Israeli case happens to be a structural component of the misbegotten entity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, one could seriously claim that mendacity makes up the backbone of
the Israeli State, which if thoroughly exposed and dissipated, the &#147;moral&#148;
justification for the State&#146;s very existence would collapse like a house of cards. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, unlike elsewhere in the world, concocting false statements and
accounts about events, such as crimes committed by Israeli occupation troops and
settler-cutthroats, is a systematic, institutionalized and organized task for which
hundreds of millions of dollars are allocated every year and hundreds of mercenary
writers, parroting columnists and unethical apologists are recruited and mobilized, all
for the purpose of hallowing the unholy and converting the lie into a &#147;truth&#148;
believed and accepted by millions of unsuspecting people around the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Take, for example, the indelible story of Muhammed al- Durra, the poor
Palestinian kid who was so callously murdered by trigger-happy Israeli army soldiers last
October as he was seeking, in vain, to escape the inescapable bullets of the heroes of
Zionism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the beginning, the Zionist mill of mendacity claimed that al-Durra was
actually killed deliberately by Palestinian &#147;gunmen&#148; in order to besmirch
Israel&#146;s &#147;fine&#148; image on the world&#146;s arena.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the lie proved to be too brash, the same mill fabricated the Satanic
and cheap claim that Palestinians were pushing their kids to the front lines in order to
embarrass the Israeli &#147;defense&#148; forces which killed them inadvertently and
regretfully.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And even today, nearly five months after the monstrous crime, and far from
saying a simple and genuine &#147;sorry&#148; for the vile deed, Israeli propagandists and
apologists, including supposedly respectable diplomats, are still unashamedly ruminating
and parroting the crass lie that al-Durra was pushed into the line of fire by his father
(his father, too, was nearly killed) in order to score a propaganda victory for the
Palestinian cause!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I don&#146;t know why I chose to stress the case of Muhammed al-Durra as a
classic Zionist lie, as there are thousands, perhaps millions, of graver Zionist lies
about every demolished house, every uprooted tree, every obliterated village and every
atrocity the lying murderers carried out. Maybe because the spectre of his phantasmagoric
death is still haunting us whenever the murder is re-enacted by Israel&#146;s born-to-kill
soldiers. Maybe because we unconsciously or subconsciously feel that we have to do
something to compensate or atone for our collective guilt as humans for not doing enough
to save the child from the ugly claws of a preventable death. Or just maybe because his
death is still so vivid and so fresh in our exhausted individual and collective memories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the Zionist robe of lying is so long, so much so that it takes
a voluminous encyclopedia to record and document Zionist lies, particularly those
disseminated since the Palestinian Nakba of 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We all are aware of their classic lies, such as &#147;the Arabs left their
hometowns and villages voluntarily in 1948 and were not expelled by the Jews,&#148;
&#147;a land without a people for a people without a land,&#148; &#147;What
Palestinians?&#148; and that &#147;we may forgive Arabs for killing our children, but we
shall not forgive them for making us kill theirs!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Luckily, there are conscientious Jews who have exposed some of these lies.
Their efforts should be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it should be equally stressed that the portion of unexposed lies
still exceeds that of the barely-exposed lies by a million to one, at the very least. Why?
Because the history of Israel and Zionism from Hertzl-the-infamous to
Sharon-the-war-criminal is actually a long concatenation of lies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, the Israeli army protested and eventually succeeded in
preventing the proposed release of historical documents dating back to 1948 about
Palestinian refugees. Israel&#146;s intelligence and defence establishment argued, rather
convincingly, that the release of the &#147;documents&#148; to the public &#147;now&#148;
would cause Israel&#146;s political stance and image irreparable damage and would
vindicate many of the Palestinian claims. One doesn&#146;t have to read between the lines;
the message these words carry is clear, perhaps too clear, for those whose job it is to
maintain the lie and perpetuate the myth for as long as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the big lie goes on, unabated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In mid-March, two Canadian rabbis castigated a conscientious fellow Jew
for writing an article in which he rightly argued that Zionism was giving a very bad name
to Judaism and that Judaism and the Torah of Moses were innocent of what Israel was doing
in the name of Jews everywhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two Zionist rabbis claimed that Israel, not the Palestinians, was
under siege in the West Bank, and that Jews, instead of criticizing Israel, should rally
behind Sharon, the hero of Sabra and Shatilla.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why do Israel&#146;s supporters lie in such a brash and primitive manner?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How could Israel, the fifth nuclear power in the world, be under siege
when her occupation army is encircling every town, village, hamlet and refugee camp in the
West Bank, effectively pushing the Palestinians to the brink of starvation, or maybe to
the brink of Auschwitz?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Do these rabbis live in this world, or are they just talking to
themselves? Indeed, how do they read the Biblical commandment &#147;Thou shall not
lie?&#148; Do they read it as &#147;Thou shall lie when and if it is expedient for
you?&#148; Isn&#146;t this Israel&#146;s and Zionism&#146;s ultimate golden rule?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But if f lying is Israel&#146;s best policy, and it is in a certain sense,
shouldn&#146;t the world, particularly those who have been exposed and victimized by
Zionist lies, doubt the Zionists&#146; official stories about other issues, such as the
holocaust, for example?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, couldn&#146;t Zionism, through its powerful propaganda machine,
which has succeeded in thoroughly penetrating and engulfing much of the world&#146;s
media, show business, and even in the academic world, lie about the events which the Jews
of Europe encountered during the Nazi era, as, indeed, it has been lying so abundantly and
so &#147;successfully&#148; about the Palestinian plight? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a Palestinian, an Arab and a Muslim who has been among the premier
victims of Zionist mendacity, I believe I have the right to and am justified in doubting,
questioning and even not believing much or most of what the Israeli and Zionist
propagandists have been saying about the holocaust.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, if Zionists could lie about their present and ongoing torment of
my people, usurpation of my homeland and arrogation of my rights, and they do it rather
obscenely, couldn&#146;t they likewise lie, equally obscenely, about the holocaust, an
event that took place over half a century ago? </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon&#146;s Message to the Palestinian People</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Hanan Ashrawi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To every man, woman and child in the Palestinian territories. YOU are my
target; you will be made to suffer; and you shall pay for the original crime of being a
Palestinian and for being there. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every camp, village, town and city is hereby declared a prison. Instead of
arresting each individual and having to build even more incarceration centres and foot the
bill for your detention, I shall simply instruct the army to dig ditches and build
barricades around your population centres, thus with one sweep render your isolation
complete. Wherever you are, you&#146;re under arrest at your own expense and in your own
home. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Schoolchildren may not reach their schools and college students are to
stay home. Some of you might try to climb over the dirt barriers or walk around the
ditches. Take your chance! After hours of misery you might find a tank (or more) lying in
wait for you. You might find snipers on your hilltops or armoured vehicles at your
crossroads. Defy the siege at your own peril, and if you die don&#146;t blame me. In my
book, you&#146;re guilty of the subversive act of seeking education. The same applies to
your teachers and school administrators who are guilty of the equally heinous crime of
attempting to teach. Besides, I can&#146;t close down all your educational institutions
with a military order: That would tarnish my new and improved image in the West (and my
new ally Shimon might not like it). This way, your institutions will collapse by
themselves and ignorance will prevail. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All patients seeking treatment (including cancer, kidney and heart
patients) are hereby forbidden to reach their hospitals and clinics. You shall suffer in
silence and you shall die in silence, for you are guilty of daring to claim the same human
treatment reserved for real people not for subhuman genetic terrorists like you. All
pregnant women will deliver in their own homes, or in ambulances and at checkpoints if
they dare defy the siege. Should you suffer complications leading to the death of your
infants (or to your own death), you have only yourselves to blame. For you are guilty of
the ultimate crime of attempting to give birth to even more Palestinian terrorists. All
mothers should know that no vaccination will be allowed to reach your children, for they
deserve no protection against infancy and childhood diseases. They too will grow up to be
a threat to our security. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All shopkeepers, tradesmen, industrialists, construction workers,
businessmen (and women, we don&#146;t discriminate) are hereby forbidden from engaging in
any kind of gainful activity. Since you cannot go anywhere anyway, you might as well stay
home and watch your families starve even if your warehouses are full of products you
cannot market. You too are guilty for attempting to conduct a normal life in defiance of
the occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This applies even more directly to farmers and peasants and all those
involved in agricultural activity. Is it not enough that we confiscated most of your land
to build settlements for those brave settlers who had defied real hardships in New York,
London, Moscow and other such hostile places to come to the Land of Milk and Honey? You
had no business being there, tilling the land and feeding your children. Now, we have to
confiscate even more lands for these settlers to build bypass roads (i.e. to bypass your
reality) and to connect them to Israel directly without having to witness the mere fact of
your existence. You call it apartheid? We call it security by the power of the gun. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If our brave settlers used their guns against you, uprooted your trees,
destroyed your crops and terrified your children, that&#146;s the least they could do
given the hardships they endured in their drive to grab more land. We, of course, are more
than happy to provide them with the full protection and support of our army while they
wreak havoc amongst you, and we will distort our laws to find them innocent no matter whom
they kill, maim, or injure from amongst you. When will you learn that you do not count?
They do, and we will make sure that in this equation you finally learn that you are the
zero. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let me be painfully frank with you. I blame you for forcing us to besiege
you, kill you, shell your homes, assassinate your activists and leaders, and perform other
such distasteful tasks (even though, I must admit, I have had a long and rich experience
in invading Arab lands, murdering civilians and prisoners of war, and massacring
Palestinians wholesale while destroying whole villages). You are truly exasperating. We
made you a generous offer whereby we would annex only parts of your land (including our
settlement clusters), expand settlements according to need (and will), annex Jerusalem and
keep it under our sovereignty (while trying our best to render it Palestinian-free), and
totally deny the Palestinian refugees their right to return. Yet, ungrateful wretches that
you are, you persisted in your stubborn refusal. You claim international law and
legitimacy? What nonsense! Only our law prevails, and we deem you illegal. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite all our attempts at persuasion (our gun-ships, tanks, sniper fire
and military checkpoints are very subtle means of persuasion), you continued to deny us
our rights to your lands and rights. We have to be able to help ourselves to that which is
yours; what else is occupation for? What other use of power if not to be unleashed on the
weak? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I therefore find you guilty and deserving of the utmost punishment (we may
not have the death penalty in our laws, but we can carry out as many extra-judicial
murders and assassinations as we please). You are guilty of holding on to your humanity,
of daring to exercise a collective (and individual) will, of refusing to succumb, of
daring to claim equal rights before the law, of maintaining your dignity and a stubborn
yearning for freedom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We, on the other hand, should be free to inflict any type of pain and
brutality on you, and it should be your lot to lie down and die quietly. You must not be
allowed to disturb our peace or security. We have the right to drive you to desperation,
and should you protest or react, not only will you be conveniently branded as terrorists,
we will also pound you into submission while calling on you to stop the violence and end
terrorism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only that, but we will stand up before CNN (and all the friendly
Western press) to expose you for not accepting our hand stretched out to you in peace.
Don&#146;t worry. They&#146;ll swallow it hook, line and sinker. We&#146;ve been feeding
them our spin for years to the point where they&#146;ve lost not only their critical
judgement and journalistic integrity, but also their sense of sight and hearing when it
comes to your image and narrative. They&#146;re guaranteed to pay attention only when you
harm an Israeli or provide them with negative proof of our stereotype. So don&#146;t count
on any audience or sympathy in the world for you are guilty and will be blamed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And if you suffer from any misguided notion that the UN or any other
global body will come to your rescue, rest assured it won&#146;t happen! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kofi Annan has been dispatched forthwith to prevent the destruction of
statues (cultural heritage) in Afghanistan; he can&#146;t be expected to deal with human
reality at the same time. Besides, we might promise him a role in the peace process
provided he behaves himself and looks the other way. We might have a harder time with your
European friends, but they too can&#146;t afford to irk us. As for the new U.S.
administration, don&#146;t hold your breath. It, too, has decided to give me time to
demonstrate my peace-making skills. And I&#146;m busy demonstrating those to the hilt, as
you can see and feel. I will make peace with you if it takes everything that you have,
including your land, lives, rights and freedom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My colleagues (including Chief of Staff General Mofaz and Minister of
Defense General Ben Eliezer) concur with me. It is wonderful to be able to do my worst and
still have Labor instruments (like Fuad) and apologists (like Peres) on my team. They
certainly clean up my image! Besides, I&#146;m not doing anything much worse than Barak
did. At least I&#146;m not shelling your homes for now (the Americans didn&#146;t like our
use of their apaches for that purpose, and it didn&#146;t look good before the cameras
anyway). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, if you know what&#146;s good for you, please behave like good little
natives and kiss the hand that beats you. Say YES to peace, my way, and I guarantee you an
efficient apartheid system. In the meantime, stop the violence and stop being the
terrorists that you are. As for me, I remain forever a pacifist and a humanist (in my own
way). If only you would see it my way. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">P.S. Note from Shimon (Peres). I really am pained at what you have to
endure, but I&#146;m truly helpless having cast my lot with the Sharons, Liebermans and
Ze&#146;evis of this world. However, I will continue to work for my vision of new
realities in the Middle East. This is only a sample of what it has in store for you. I
have to rush and meet with my European colleagues and members of the press to let them
know that Sharon isn&#146;t all that bad. He is a new man for a new age. Given my (and
his) history and age, I have a tough job selling that spin! What do you think?</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Deir Yassin: Looking beyond the massacre</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></p>

<blockquote>
  </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">There are in the national march of every people certain important
  historical milestones that cannot be ignored. They indicate the direction from which they
  came, the distance they covered, and the course they must follow. In India, the 1919
  massacre at Jallianwala Bagh had set the tone for later independence from Britain. In
  South Africa, the 1960 Sharpeville massacre equally influenced the course of the
  anti-apartheid struggle. The massacre of 254 Palestinian men, women and children at Deir
  Yassin on 9 April 1948 continues to play a similar pivotal role in the Palestinian
  struggle against Zionist colonial rule. Its 53<sup>rd</sup> anniversary takes on a special
  meaning and significance as it coincides with the seventh month of the Aqsa uprising.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">For all its barbarity and horror, the massacre at Deir Yassin was not an
  isolated act of madness committed by a &#145;dissident&#146; group of Zionist fanatics.
  Code-named &#147;Operation Unity&#148; by its planners, the attack as its name suggests
  was an integral part of an orchestrated campaign during which the invaders carried out 34
  other massacres and obliterated 531 Palestinian villages in 1948. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Situated on the outskirts of West Jerusalem, Deir Yassin has since been
  given another name: Kfar Sha&#146;ul&#151;in the same manner as Zimbabwe was called
  Rhodesia. The memory of the village did not, however, die in 1948. Its origins, growth and
  achievements were never forgotten. The country&#146;s pre-eminent historian, Walid
  Khalidi, recalls the village was named after a certain venerable Shaykh Yassin (not the
  founder of the Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas). It contained a mosque also named after
  him, his tomb, and a large courtyard where wedding receptions and other social events were
  held.<sup>1</sup> </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ever since that fateful Friday in April 1948, the Israeli establishment
  has tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to remove the bloodstained evidence of their crime.
  Never known for their humility to admit wrongdoing or apologize to their victims, the
  Zionists were, nevertheless, forced to admit their guilt and shame for the massacre at
  Deir Yassin; not least because it had come so soon after they were rescued from the Nazi
  gas chambers. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In characteristic fashion the Jewish Agency tried at first to disassociate
  itself from the crime. Then, acting apparently under directives from Ben Gurion, the
  Agency sent a letter of apology to King Abdullah I of Jordan disclaiming responsibility
  and condemning the &#145;brutal and barbaric deed.&#146; The King was infuriated. He told
  the Egyptian daily, <i>al-Ahram</i>, on 17 April 1948, that he considered the Deir Yassin
  massacre a declaration of war on Transjordan and all the Arab States and that he did not
  recognize the Jewish State. </p>
  <b><u><p ALIGN="LEFT">Infamy and debate<br>
  </u></b>This anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre comes as a massive source of
  embarrassment to the custodians of freedom, democracy and human rights in the West as well
  as the East. It makes a mockery of their collective failure to prevent Israel&#146;s
  transformation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip into a virtual concentration camp. It pours
  scorn on the hypocrisy of those who bizarrely call upon the Palestinian victims of
  occupation to exercise self-restraint while their women and children are being killed in
  their homes daily, as they were 53 years ago at Deir Yassin. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Between the massacre of 1948 and this year&#146;s anniversary one
  distinguishing element has emerged: that there is no wild panic or hysterical flight
  today, even though Israeli inhumanity and cruelty has multiplied immeasurably. Faced with
  far more lethal weapons than the inhabitants of Deir Yassin, Palestinians in the occupied
  territories have learnt from experience that their future lies not in the hands of
  &#145;powers&#146; that have neither the political will nor moral courage to uphold
  international law and justice but in their own determination to be free and independent.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">If helicopter gun-ships, rocket launchers, missiles and poisoned gas were
  all that is required to subjugate or exterminate peoples, surely the Palestinians would
  have been subjugated, if not exterminated, a long time ago. But, when one of the most
  equipped armies in the world does not believe in the justice of its cause or the efficacy
  of its methods then that army is doomed to failure, defeat and humiliation. This is the
  dilemma currently facing the Jewish State. With no objectives save the humiliation of the
  Arab peoples and conquest of their land, water and oil reserves, Zionist Israel has become
  an endangered species because of its maltreatment of the Palestinian people. As Afrikaan
  tyranny and greed for South African gold and diamonds were not enough to ensure the
  survival of apartheid, so, too, Zionist avarice and repression would fuel Palestinian
  resistance from one generation to another.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This year&#146;s remembrance of the Deir Yassin massacre goes well beyond
  an exposure of Israel&#146;s military limitations and weaknesses. With equal force, it
  uncovers the darkest depths of ideological bankruptcy into which political Zionism has
  sunk. Whereas in 1948 the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem had excommunicated the perpetrators of
  the massacre, today the situation is turned on its head. When two leading British rabbis
  announced their intention to participate in the 53<sup>rd</sup> commemoration of the
  massacre, they were denounced by lay elements within British Jewry for getting the facts
  wrong: that &#147;the fallen Arabs of Deir Yassin&#148; were not the victims of a
  premeditated massacre but instead war casualties. </p>
  <b><u><p ALIGN="LEFT">Shaping the future<br>
  </u></b>While this anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre has provoked a belated debate
  within the upper echelons of British Jewry, it has evoked no reflection or contrition
  within the British political establishment. For sure there would be no lowering of the
  national flag at half-mast, no minute of silence or prayers for the victims of the
  terrorist act which contributed more than any other to the dispossession and exile of the
  Palestinian people. Few officials in Whitehall, if any, would recall the &#145;sacred
  trust of civilization&#146; assumed by Britain on 19 June 1919 when it signed the Covenant
  of the League of Nations to ensure the &#145;well-being and development&#146; of the
  Palestinian people. Fewer numbers would question why the Mandatory military intelligence
  in Palestine failed to protect the civilian population of Deir Yassin in their greatest
  hour of need. None may ever ask why electricity was not supplied to the village while it
  was provided to the neighbouring Jewish settlements. Should there not be a posthumous
  trial of the perpetrators of this ghastly crime, especially since it has now become the
  order of the day to prosecute war criminals not only in absentia but even posthumously?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">For all its worth, none of the such symbolic gestures would assuage the
  sense of betrayal that is now ingrained in the Palestinian national psyche. What occurred
  at Deir Yassin is not just a symbol of savagery and man&#146;s inhumanity to his fellow
  being. It was in so many ways the inauguration of an institution and way of life now
  manifest in military occupation, siege and wanton killing. What is important in the
  circumstances, therefore, is that this occasion must not be used to indulge in self-pity
  or lamentation. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">To the same degree that Deir Yassin remains a symbol of Zionist inhumanity
  it must also be upheld as a sign of Palestinian strength and determination. Deir Yassin
  was neither the first nor the last in a chain of massacres carried out against the
  Palestinian people. They have as a result suffered incalculable losses. Their march to
  national independence and development was set back. Yet they have not been defeated.
  Confronted by an adversary that is supported and backed by the world&#146;s most powerful
  nations, they have still survived. Hence the greatest lesson that must be underscored on
  the 53<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of the massacre is that no amount of terrorism and/or
  barbarity can deter or break the will of a people who thirst for freedom.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In reality there is nothing to suggest that Zionist Israel has learnt from
  the past. There has been no fundamental change in its policies toward the Palestinians
  since 1948. Five decades after they were assisted by the international community to
  establish a State in Palestine, Israel is still ruled by a revolving junta of generals and
  immigrants, such as Rechavam Zeevi who advocates the expulsion of the Palestinians not
  just from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip but even from the Kingdom of Jordan as
  well. Jordan, he claims, is the historic home of three Jewish tribes: Gad, Reuven and
  Menashe.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Accordingly, if there can be any claim to a change in Israeli policy it is
  the fact that it has become more brutal in its attacks upon the children&#150;the
  future&#150;of Palestine. Those who understand the role of education as a means of
  liberation will understand perfectly well why Palestinian universities and schools are
  shelled, closed or converted into barracks for the occupying army. Here again the
  colonizer has ignored the lessons from recent history. How many students were killed in
  Soweto and other South African townships for resisting apartheid? How many were arrested
  and imprisoned only for attending funerals and expressing grief? Israel&#146;s pursuit of
  the same policies will certainly produce the same results in occupied Palestine.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In its aftermath, Deir Yassin did not merely leave a trail of blood and
  destruction across the landscape of Palestine. It further left in its wake millions of
  shattered lives and a refugee problem that remains unresolved to this day. No
  commemoration of the massacre can therefore be completed with only a remembrance of the
  martyrs. It must also look toward the future of the millions who currently live under the
  yoke of occupation or in the wilderness of exile. For this reason there can hardly be a
  better theme for the occasion than: looking beyond the massacre&#151;toward a future of
  reconstruction and nation building in a free, united and independent Palestine. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Hind and the Massacre at Deir Yassin</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Ruth Anderson</i></strong></p>
<i><font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4"><strong>

<p ALIGN="center"></strong>&#147;</font>The world will little note nor long remember what
we say here, but it can never<br>
forget what they did here.&#148;-Abraham Lincoln (from the Gettysburg Address)</i></p>
<strong>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></strong>On 9 April 1948, Irgun and Stern Gang units massacred the
inhabitants of the peaceful village of Deir Yassin while Haganah forces attacked the
village of Castel. The Israeli Defense Forces&#146; report admitted the massacre of 254
Palestinian men, women and children and said that it was a &#147;decisive accelerating
factor&#148; of the Palestinian exodus. One Israeli soldier present at the slaughter
described how the Irgun forces &#147;shot everyone they saw in the houses, including women
and children&#133;&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just before Jewish terrorists massacred the villagers of Deir Yassin,
Abdul Qader Husseini was slain at Castel. Husseini was the charismatic and brave leader of
the Palestinian resistance. His death was a great loss to the Palestinians for it deprived
them of exceptional leadership just when they needed it most.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both the Deir Yassin massacre and the death of Husseini were the disasters
that broke the spirit of the Palestinian resistance during the first 10 days of April.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Irgun Gang assaulted Deir Yassin from the south-east while the Stern
Gang attacked from the east. The assault began at dawn. It was a Friday. The village of
stonecutters had been at peace with their Jewish neighbours and did not want fighting to
break out in their area. But when some sentries caught sight of the invading forces, they
alerted the sleeping village. Those who were lucky enough to flee did so, others stayed
behind to defend the village. Many, especially women and children, had no time to escape.
The British colonists had made sure that Palestinians were denied access to weapons and
many times Palestinians who were caught with guns or even just the possession of one
bullet were imprisoned. This law left the Palestinians mostly unarmed or poorly equipped,
while the Haganah, Irgun and Stern gangs were heavily armed and trained in subversive
warfare and terrorist actions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The village was bombarded by mortar attacks from three different
directions. By noon, all resistance was silenced and the Jewish invaders moved in to
perform their &#147;clean-up operation&#148; which took them from house to house where
they machine-gunned homes and then threw in grenades. It didn&#146;t matter who was in the
houses. Men, women and children were brought out and lined up against a wall and shot. It
was not enough that helpless women and children were savagely killed, but members of these
gangs ripped open pregnant women&#146;s stomachs with knives. One lady tried to save the
fetus of a female whose stomach was bayoneted but the Jewish forces shot and killed her in
the process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the men from the village were rounded up, loaded on trucks and
then paraded through the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem before they were taken to a stone
quarry and shot in cold blood. Some surviving women and children were forced on trucks and
released at the Mandelbaum Gate, Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A representative of the International Red Cross later described how he had
gone to Deir Yassin after 9 April to see if there were any survivors. He could tell that
the &#147;clean-up&#148; had been performed with machine-guns, grenades and then finished
off with knives. He saw a female member of the gangs rush past him, a mad gleam in her
eyes. In her hand she held a long knife still dripping with the blood of those she had
helped murder.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the morning of 9 April, as the innocents were being massacred in Deir
Yassin, Abdel Qadar Husseini, the most revered of all Palestinian fighters was being
buried in Jerusalem at the sacred Haram al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also in Jerusalem, his cousin, Hind Husseini, coordinator of the Arab
Women&#146;s Union, mourned over the death of her relative. She also tried to listen to
the news of the war over the radio. She heard a knock on her door and when she went to
open it, she was met by six orphaned children from Deir Yassin. She immediately took them
into her home. Some were covered with blood and others were too frightened to speak. Some
of the children had not been slaughtered along with the adults because they hid under beds
or their parents shielded them with their dead bodies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the next week, Hind worked with Adnan Tamimi to locate the surviving
children of Deir Yassin. They found 55 in all. Hind put aside all thoughts of marriage and
decided to dedicate her life to her babies. Her family was sympathetic to her wishes and
gave her Dar Husseini, the home her grandfather built and the place where she was born. On
her 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday, just two weeks after the massacre at Deir Yassin, Hind
renamed the mansion Dar el-Tifl (Children&#146;s House).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hind dedicated her life to the orphans that she had found or who had found
her. She made caring for the children her full-time job and worked diligently to provide
them with an education and help them find homes or jobs later on. With the help of others,
she created a school for girls that educated more than 1,450 females from pre-school to
the 12<sup>th</sup> grade. Eventually, Dar el-Tifl offered college course credits and
graduate degrees. Today, 250 orphans live at Dar el-Tifl.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hind died in September 1995. Thousands of people have been positively
affected by this saint&#146;s benevolent generosity and her noble dedication. The orphans
of Deir Yassin will never be able to forget the tragedy they witnessed the day of the
massacre. Their scars will last for generations to come. But Hind was there to give them
hope and to give them love.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, however, everyday Israelis commit new Deir Yassins and the slaughter of
the innocents continues.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Towards a just peace in the Middle East</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Saad Fayoumi*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I have the ultimate conviction that the Arab leaders in general and the
Palestinian leaders in particular are making a big mistake in their strategy for the
return of the Palestinian refugees to their homes as well as for ending the Israeli
occupation of all Arab lands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I wonder why the Arabs are still running after the Israelis begging them
to sit around a table and negotiate a peaceful settlement to the conflict while they know
very well that such negotiations would lead nowhere, especially since the Israelis are
neither willing to completely evacuate the lands they have occupied since 1967 (East
Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Syrian Golan Heights as well as the Lebanese
Shabaa farms) nor to allow the return of the refugees who were forced to flee their homes
in 1948 from what became Israel!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Have the Arab leaders forgotten the existence of many United Nations
Security Council resolutions to settle these problems? Have they forgotten in particular
resolution 194 of 1948 concerning the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their
homes in Israel and resolution 242 of 1967 concerning the withdrawal of Israel from all
Arab lands they occupied since 1967?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Have the Arab leaders forgotten that these Security Council resolutions
have been drafted, formulated, decided and voted on by the permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council and particularly by the U.S. and the UK.?</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>YES,&#148; the Arab leaders should turn to the permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council and ask them to put the necessary pressure
on Israel to implement resolutions 194 and 242. After all, the task of the five permanent
members of the Security Council is not only to decide resolutions but also to enforce the
implementation of the resolutions they have voted for! Isn&#146;t this the argument used
every time by the U.S. and the UK to oppress the Arabs and Muslims worldwide?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course I am neither asking nor expecting the U.S. or the UK to put as
much pressure on Israel as they have put on Iraq to withdraw their troops from Kuwait nor
to commit against Israel the horrible genocide they are still committing against the Iraqi
people 10 years after the Iraqis evacuated Kuwait under the pretext of implementing United
Nations Security Council resolutions! They can deal with Israel the way they want as long
as the outcome is the full and immediate compliance of Israel with the said Security
Council resolutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fifty-three years of denying the Palestinians their rights to return to
their homes is ENOUGH and 34 years of occupation of Arab land is also ENOUGH! Moreover,
oppressing 1 billion persons worldwide systematically only and simply because they are
Muslims is also ENOUGH!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the eve of the next Arab Summit in Amman, I hope and pray that God will
give the Arab leaders enough courage to include in their final communiqu a call on the
permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations asking them to fulfil
their responsibilities and put enough pressure on Israel to implement the Security Council
resolutions in order to have a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The Arab leaders
should finally understand that silent diplomacy will lead nowhere. They have to keep
claiming their rights loudly and firmly not only to the Western governments but also in
the Western media.. No doubt the public opinion in the U.S. and Europe will support the
Arab Cause when they understand that it is right. The difficulty is trying to explain it
to them in a simple, easy and clever way! </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><em>E.Yaghi</em></strong></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="center">&#147;</font><i>What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything
and the value of nothing.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Oscar Wilde</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lately I discovered that the world is overflowing with cynics. Take, for
example, how the international community is disturbed about the Taleban&#146;s destruction
of the towering statues of Buddha. The United Nations General Assembly urged the Taleban
of Afghanistan to honour their previous commitments to protecting the cultural heritage of
their country. A resolution approved by consensus of more than 100 countries beseeched the
Taleban to take immediate action to prevent further destruction of what they call the
irreplaceable relics, monuments and artefacts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I discovered that if I were an ancient, inanimate relic, the world would
come rallying forth to preserve me and pronounce me irreplaceable. If I were considered an
endangered species, there would be volunteers from every country who would diligently work
to preserve what remains of my fellow cohabitants and me.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But I am a Palestinian from Ramallah. Though I am not inanimate, I am an
endangered species. Yet, no one has rushed to my defence. No General Assembly has urgently
called for my protection; there are not over 100 countries begging the Israelis to save me
and there are no volunteers from all over the world to worry about my extinction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Because the Israelis have built trenches to isolate me from the rest of
the world and because of the Israeli siege, blockades, closures, curfews and collective
punishment, my very existence is at stake. I have been denied access to proper health
care, to making a livelihood, from going to the market, from peaceful demonstrations, from
attending classes at Bir Zeit University and from visiting the sick who live across the
barriers that have been set up to liquidate me. Every aspect of my life is being destroyed
as I helplessly watch and while the cynics worry about the giant statues of Buddha half a
world away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon sheds his crocodile tears
as he tells the world that he is willing to talk peace only when the Palestinians stop the
violence. I know that the Israeli leaders are masters of deception but come on now, in all
honesty and in all fairness, I ask you, just who is being violent?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I realize that ancient artefacts, relics and mammoth statues of Buddha are
valued more than Palestinians. I realize that my life is of no worth to anyone but me,
though I myself believe in the sanctity of all life. My tears have turned to blood because
of how much I have cried for the dead that are carried away in what has become not the
rare but the norm. Palestinian graveyards are full of the newly fallen and everyday
Israeli sharpshooters aim to permanently maim or kill.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said that Israel&#146;s new government would
take swift steps to ease Palestinian economic hardships and pave the way for a resumption
of peace talks. But as his forked tongue wags, trenches are dug deeper, houses are shelled
in the middle of the night, the IDF burst into the homes of the innocent and arrest
parents of terrified children, farms are destroyed, tress uprooted and homes bulldozed.
Yet I do not hear the outrage of the international community. I hear no one demanding an
end to these daily war crimes that are being waged against the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Were I your inanimate historical icon, you would do your best to preserve
and safeguard me. Remember, the world is full of cynics who know the price of everything
but the value of nothing. My blood is on your hands and until you do something to stop the
liquidation of my people and me, you will not be able to wash it away.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, it seems to me, they do not even need to have things under wraps
    these days! A good Muslim friend of mine volunteered to go to Gaza earlier this year. He
    is a doctor, and I thought he would be of great help to the people there. He returned
    earlier than expected. Actually, the news of his return came to me rather by accident. I
    overheard some boys talking about Palestine outside the mosque. My heart swelled with joy!
    Could it be that they too felt something for Palestine and her people? My joy was
    short-lived&#133;they were convinced that &#147;All is well in Palestine!&#148; I could
    have been forgiven for idealistically believing for an instant that they were right! Had I
    missed the great news? Had all the Jews miraculously left Palestine? Was the occupation
    over? </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">An acute sense of expectation permeated through me as I listened more
    attentively. They were just talking about the report they had received from my doctor
    friend. Is this really what he had said? I needed to speak with him. That night he
    returned my call with the exciting news that &#147;all is well in Gaza, and indeed
    throughout Palestine!&#148; He said that the people all had enough food, clothing, homes,
    everything they needed! According to him, they need nothing from us! I remember his tone,
    so condescending, so &#147;high-and-mighty&#148;, like I was such a fool for buying into
    all the Palestinian &#147;stories,&#148; for collecting money for people who didn&#146;t
    &#147;need&#148; it, for crying for a people that didn&#146;t &#147;warrant&#148; my
    tears! It felt like he was trying to convince me to stop my &#147;foolishness!&#148; </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">I did not stay on the line long enough to hear any more of his fanciful
    tale of the &#147;Palestinian Paradise.&#148; I had had enough! Thoughts flooded my mind
    as tears overwhelmed me&#133;And I asked, &#147;Oh Allah, how could this be?&#148; Had
    this man really been to Gaza? Gaza, Palestine? For how could it be that a Muslim would
    visit a place of such suffering and pain, and yet be blinded to it? </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Did he not see the orphans? Did he not see the crying mothers? Did he not
    see the camps? Did he not see the bulldozed homes or uprooted orchards? Did he not see the
    many hungry people queuing for food rations, even on Eid? Where WAS he? </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">I came to realize, as I sobered up a bit, that they had succeeded in
    putting a screen before his eyes. Going through customs as a VIP, without questions,
    searches or harassment; living in luxury hotels along the Mediterranean shore; being
    treated like a king by people who treat the rest of us worse than animals, had
    successfully convinced him to see the world their way: through blue-and-white-coloured,
    six-sided, star-shaped spectacles! </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">He is an influential person, from an influential family, in an even
    wealthier and influential community. Perhaps this is what makes this worse in my mind. The
    fact that he will be able to sell his story to others here! There are far too many people
    who are just waiting for an excuse to forget Palestine again, an excuse he is so willing
    to provide! The ties of friendship have been cut, for how can I befriend someone who is a
    mouthpiece for the oppressors? </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">But I am reminded &#147;no one can misguide those whom Allah has
    guided&#148;! And for everyone of him, there are thousands more who have their eyes open,
    and who are willing to defend Truth, no matter what! And as I reaffirm my belief in the
    Oneness, Might, infinite Mercy and Help of Allah (swt), I say to him and all those like
    him: I will NOT stop; the Muslims of the world will NOT stop; not even a grain of sand
    that exists on the Palestinian Holy ground will stop until we reach our goal: To liberate
    Al-Aqsa, liberate the whole of Palestine and her people, and replant the Flag of Islam on
    her blessed soil! So it is Jihad of the pen; Jihad of words; Jihad of the heart; and yes,
    of the stones, too, until victory! We will NOT stop, no matter what! Birruh, Bidamm,
    nafdika ya Aqsa (we sacrifice [our] souls and [our] blood for al-Aqsa)! </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israel&#146;s Dirty Dozen (S):<br>
A Case of Zionist &#147;Foot And Mouth Disease&#148;</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Dr. Mohamed Khodr</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In one of my favorite movies, &#147;The Dirty Dozen&#148;, Lee Marvin
gathers twelve men of disrepute who&#146;ve committed murder, felony crimes, fraud and
robbery for an undercover mission against a German target. Although all but two die, they
succeed in their mission. The Nazis are such evil people that we cheer these men as they
kill military and civilian men and women alike in cold-blooded fashion, shoving them into
the basement, blocking all access and laying siege to the palace until all are murdered.
We feel detached and desensitized to the death of the Nazi &#147;terrorists and
murderers&#148; because of our historical knowledge and indoctrination through the media
and movies that all Nazi&#146;s are evil. Today, the Germans, Italians, Japanese and the
Turks are our friends and allies because the same information age media that demonized
them now praises them. Even after spending $5 trillion dollars in our Cold War with
Russia, we have developed a non-threatening stable relationship with the former
&#147;Commies.&#148; We&#146;ve even dumped our former &#147;friend&#148; Taiwan for the
sake of China. A lesson for all our &#147;friends&#148; to keep in mind: we&#146;re a
fickle nation and we&#146;ll dump you faster than you can say a buck.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This same information age media has for decades indoctrinated us into the
false belief that Israel is our &#145;&#147;friend and ally&#148; and the only democratic,
peace-loving nation in the Middle East, a region brushed with the same demonizing
celluloid and ink used against the former Nazis. Since Americans are a good-hearted people
with a knack for quick superficial understandings of issues and who loathe any
&#147;serious&#148; discussions and confrontations, we surrender our thoughts and feelings
to our bastion of &#147;knowledge&#148;&#151;the media and entertainment industry. And
there, my humanoid friends, is the RUB.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Realizing the power of pictures and words on our fragile psyche, Israel
and its pro-Zionist community have cultivated a gang of writers, editors, columnists,
journalists, producers, directors, owners, advertisers, marketers, spin doctors, public
relation firms, financial institutions, political action committees, monitoring groups,
Washington-based think tanks, newspapers, magazines, television stations, radios, movie
studios, a &#147;rapid response attack force&#148;, and so much more that it takes our
&#147;free speech&#148; breath away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most dangerous among these gangs are Israel&#146;s American columnists
whose allegiance to this country is questionable given their propensity to keep the
Arab-Israeli conflict alive and well to the financial, military and expansionist land
policy of Israel: they are the real &#147;Dirty Dozen(s).&#148; They are the rich,
successful, unchallenged purveyors of bias, hate, myth-making and lies who adorn the pages
of the Op-Ed pages of our most powerful papers and who value Israel&#146;s interests above
America&#146;s.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>The Dirty Dozen(s) Honour Roll</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jeff Jacoby, George Will, Cal Thomas, Charles Krauthammer, Daniel Pipes,
Steve Emerson, Edward Luttwak, Mark Halprin, William Safire, Thomas Friedman, Mort
Zuckerman, R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., Don Feder, James Pinkerton, Judith Miller, etc. etc.
etc.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These media &#147;mouths&#148; provide the political cover, justification
and requisite preemptive intimidation of Congress and any potential critic of Israel that
allows Israel&#146;s &#147;Foot&#148; soldiers and government to stomp upon the lives and
land of occupied Palestine, to lay siege to their lives, to determine what food, water, or
medicine gets to them, to demolish their homes at will, to tear apart their farms, olive
trees and roads at their whim, to imprison thousands and torture them, to liquidate any
activist fighting the military occupation, and to force our proud nation to kowtow to
Israel&#146;s needs and embarrass itself around the world by vetoing even the simplest
United Nations resolution that condemns Israel&#146;s human rights abuses and murder of
schoolchildren.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no greater example of man&#146;s inhumanity to man than what
Israel has been unleashing upon the lives of Palestinian women, children and old men for
the last 52 years. These &#147;dirty&#148; journalists and their employers deliberately
deprive America and the world of the horrid hatred toward Arabs, Palestinians and Islam
that many in Israel feel and express through the armed Jewish settlers and army
bulldozers. They deprive us of television pictures of wounded and dying Palestinian
babies, of grieving mothers, of children shot by snipers through their hearts or in their
beds. They deprive us of sympathetic stories that could affect America&#146;s public
opinion that they realize will definitely go against Israel and the doormat pandering of
our politicians who at election time discover their Jewish roots. America&#146;s
television lenses are only focused on Israeli loss, blood and grief. The camera will
capture the smiling face of an Israeli soldier ignoring his foot that&#146;s pressing on
the neck of a Palestinian mother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our &#147;free&#148; media, with its pro-Israeli bias, understands that as
long as the &#147;Palestinian&#148; story is ignored, as long as they continue portraying
Israel as the victim and not the murderous &#147;rogue&#148; State that it is, that as
long as they intimidate by any means necessary anyone daring to speak up against Israel,
our government will continue to pour the hundreds of tax dollars and latest weapons
technology to Israel out of fear of &#147;AIPAC: American Israeli Political Action
Committee&#148; and its hundred of Statewide political action committees. It&#146;s either
&#147;shut up&#148; or you are an &#147;anti-Semite&#148;: a label guaranteed to be picked
up and repeated by news outlets throughout the country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">None of the 50 States in the union have the un-Constitutional
representation Israel has in our country. While each State has two senators, Israel has
10. While Virginia with a greater population than Israel has 11 House Representatives,
Israel has 23 House Representatives. Shockingly, one of Israel&#146;s most ardent
salivating supporters in the House is Rep. Benjamin Gilman  of New York who was recently
removed from his Chairmanship of the House International Relations Committee, but his
influence and power forced the House to create a special sub-committee just for him to
chair called the Middle East Affairs Sub-Committee so he can whip the House and media into
a pro-Israeli frenzy. No other Representative can muster such clout to form his very own
sub-committee to deal with an important issue for his State. This is an outrage. Israel
and its Jewish partners in our country have blurred the line that defines America&#146;s
relationship with another sovereign nation to the extent that during Clinton&#146;s
administration almost every important Cabinet, Agency and Ambassadorial position was
filled by Pro-Israel Jewish Americans. Many of these appointees came to government from
Israeli lobbying groups and think tanks and now many returned to their Pro-Israel lobbying
jobs. This is a new and unprecedented definition of an unpatriotic &#147;Exchange
Programme.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, our country has been fortunately free from the virus causing
Europe&#146;s &#147;Foot and Mouth Disease,&#148; but, unfortunately, we have not been so
free from the Zionist virus that&#146;s causing America&#146;s version of &#147;Foot and
Mouth&#148; Disease responsible for infecting and corrupting our nation&#146;s political
system. Israelis and Palestinians are tragically suffering and dying owing to the failure
of Zionism that recognizes the humanity, welfare and wealth of Jews only. Our media shares
a great deal of responsibility for this inhumane yet easily solvable tragedy. With their
words and pictures, these dirty media &#147;humans&#148; contribute to the death of
innocents on both sides. They have truly sold their conscience to the devil.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We as Americans can cure this &#147;Dirty&#148; Virus before it engulfs us
further into a military and economic confrontation with 1.2 billion Muslims; a
confrontation manufactured for us and one that goes against our national interests, our
morals, our sense of justice and humanity. Our silence and quiet acquiescence to the
Zionist viral propaganda and its &#147;dirty&#148; purveyors are at the root of many of
our failed policies and conflicts overseas. These &#147;dirty&#148; Zionists are few but
powerful and don&#146;t even represent the majority of Jews in our country.</p>

<p>It&#146;s time to find our backbone, our voice, and find a permanent Anti-Viral cure
for this dirty &#147;Foot and Mouth Disease.&#148; We&#146;ve eliminated the SMALLPOX, now
let&#146;s eliminate the BIGPOX on our nation&#146;s conscience. God bless us all to do
the right thing and finally find our moral compass for truth and justice.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The sinister master of Terrorism <br>
condemns Palestinian &#147;terror&#148;</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Dr. Musil Shehadeh</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During his recent visit to Washington, Sharon solicited the help of the
U.S. to support his uncompromising position of erasing &#147;terror&#148; in the West Bank
and Gaza before he would participate in any future peace process. The inconceivable
impudence of Sharon is unveiled if we were to compare him with Lenin and Trotsky giving us
lectures on the virtues of religion and the belief in God, or the infamous Mafia leader Al
Capone discussing the merits of proper social behaviour. Even then such contrast does not
hold enough credibility when we realize that Lenin, Trotsky and Capone were proud to
publicize their views and actions, while Sharon with obvious chutzpah denies it, trying to
appear to the outside world as a man of peace. The gang leader who committed the most
heinous crimes in Qibia in 1953, the butcher of Sabra and Shatilla in 1982 and the mass
murderer of hundreds of Egyptian prisoners of war and many others is asking the world to
view him with a new image as a man of peace. One might have a short memory to forget the
evil acts in the past, but the apex of flagrant travesty is clearly unveiled when this
butcher is still giving orders to his tanks and choppers to strike at the heart of
civilian centres in the West Bank and Gaza while talking about peace at the same time to
the Western media! Killing indiscriminately innocent women and children, the man justifies
such actions as the only way of stopping &#147;terror.&#148; Of course he does not mention
that the rock-throwing Palestinian youths are not doing that in Tel Aviv but in defence of
their homes in the West Bank and Gaza. To complete his obvious evils of hiding his terror
from the world, he is asking the United Nations not to send any fact-finding commission to
the areas of conflict, forgetting that in this time of communications such crimes could
not be obstructed forever from reaching the whole world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The miserable status quo of strangling the lives of the innocent
Palestinians is further aggravated when we witness our leadership shamefully begging this
butcher to meet with them to continue the &#147;peace&#148; process. Searching for all
possible motives for such a proposed meeting, I admit that I have failed to see one
glimpse of hope for peace in such a step. Sharon has declared time after another that
Jerusalem will remain as the undivided capital of Israel forever, which would include
Haram al-Sharif. He would not even consider placing on his &#147;peace&#148; agenda the
most important key to peace in the region, which is the unwavering Palestinian demand for
their right to return. He has instructed his Ministry of Housing to proceed again with the
building of thousands of houses in East Jerusalem at Jebel Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) for new
Jewish settlements on Palestinian lands. He has clearly advocated that his
&#147;generous&#148; offer of re-deployment of his troops from the West Bank and Gaza
would not exceed more than 40%, or 8% of Palestine, if peace were to be finalized. Such an
Israeli ceiling has totally clamped tightly against any possibility of peaceful
coexistence with the Jewish State with such humiliating dictated conditions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With this in mind, I am bewildered at the PA leadership&#146;s demand for
continuing the peace process with Sharon. What other alternatives do we have, would be the
usual PA response for such a demeaning attempt. What many of us do not realize is that
with all the circumstances that we are passing through, the best alternative is not to
have one until the entire climate changes drastically to one that would allow a better
negotiating position. With all our weaknesses notwithstanding, we the Palestinians still
hold the major key for war and peace in the entire region. Without us, Israel cannot
become an accepted member in the Middle East community since we represent the only bridge
that Israel desperately needs to cross to the Arab and Muslim world. Without our
blessings, Israel will always remain as an isolated fortified castle in the midst of
hostile surroundings. Without us, Israel could never dream of living in peace in this
region, nor could it claim that it represents the &#147;safe&#148; haven for world Jewry.
Israel cannot do more damage to us more than it has done. It would not annex the remaining
areas, absorbing such huge numbers of non-Jewish Palestinians, because that would
jeopardize their holy fixed objective of keeping Israel as a totally Jewish State. With
all our miseries notwithstanding, time is not necessarily on the side of Israel for the
first time since the Arab-Israeli conflict began. We have no good reason to panic if we
realize that any future prospects cannot be worse than the status quo. We should unify our
different Palestinian factions and continue with our intifadah while seeking ways and
means to develop such an uprising into a more effective process that should not exclude
the future unified national armed struggle against this cruel occupier. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Blessed are the Palestinian women</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Ramzy Baroud *</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aydeh Efteehe, a 43-year-old Palestinian woman, rushed with her three
children and her husband to safety, seeking shelter from Israeli army shelling in the town
of al-Bireh. Home was so close, yet the journey seemed endless as flying bullets and
shells wandered aimlessly in the already devastated town. Aydeh and her family were
trapped. It was too late to go back, and home seemed like a mirage. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Saturday, 8 March 2001, Aydeh was shot dead by Israeli troops as she
desperately tried to protect her family. Hospital sources say that the Palestinian mother
was hit in the stomach by a bullet used in Israeli machine-guns. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An enlarged poster of Aydeh<b>, </b>smiling in a simple, black sweater and
eyes filled with hope, was marched before her coffin through the streets of al-Bireh. Her
three children, neatly dressed with their hair combed, marched behind crying. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aydeh died only a few days before the world celebrated International
Women&#146;s Day. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During Muslim holidays, Palestinians tend to visit the graves of their
loved ones, with pockets full of candy for children and an abundance of tears for those
whom they lost in past years. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aydeh was also visited during the Muslim Eid two days after her death as
many came to cry at her grave. She was a good mother, a great wife and a strong woman,
people say. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, also, thousands of Palestinian women visited graveyards all over
Palestine. Many of them come with fresh tragedies to tell as their husbands, sons and
daughters were just added to the graveyards&#146; population. In the last five months
alone, over 400 of them were killed and many more are likely to meet the same fate as
Israeli troops remain unmerciful. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The United Nations says that the International Women&#146;s day is meant
&#147;to acknowledge the contribution of women to international peace and security.&#148;
A small addition to such a statement might be worth considering: &#147;..and to a
nation&#146;s ability to resist and survive.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While many women worldwide are rewarded and recognized for writing a
romance novel, releasing an album or painting a highly acclaimed piece of art, Palestinian
women were accused of sending their children to be killed by Israelis in exchange for
trivial political gains. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How cruel life has been to Palestinian women. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is no longer shocking to learn that a Palestinian mother gave birth or
lost her fetus at an Israeli military checkpoint after a long and desperate wait. Seeing a
Palestinian mother screaming in vain by the side of her martyred son or trying to block
the arrest of another is a daily happening now in Palestine, as it was a routine event for
over 50 years. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Standing in a long line of Palestinians forced into poverty by the Israeli
siege of the West Bank and Gaza, an old woman stood, watching a very long line of
dignified men and women who patiently waited for some milk, flour and rice provided by
relief organizations.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We were told for many years that the world is going to stand
by us and support us, and here we are, empty-handed,&#148; said the woman. &#147;I
remember standing here in a similar line to get some milk for my hungry children many
years ago. And I am standing here again to get milk for my hungry grandchildren. My legs
are so weak and can no longer hold me up, but I have to wait,&#148; she uttered as tears
prevailed over her defiant spirit. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet the old Palestinian grandmother is not the only woman in Palestine who
has to wait. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hospitals are flooded with waiting mothers by the bedside of loved ones.
Prisons are crowded with waiting mothers who need to see a glimpse of their sons and
daughters. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Graveyards are also filled with waiting mothers. But for those mothers,
however, the wait seems unnecessary as they manage to always return empty-handed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Women&#146;s Day arrives and Palestinian women seem as if they
have very little to celebrate. Such a statement, however, cannot be further from the
truth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s Aydeh&#146;s death that brought life to her children. It&#146;s
the old woman&#146;s determination to bring milk for her children and grandchildren that
fosters a generation of resolute men and women. It&#146;s the mothers and wives who wait
for many years across the street from their sons&#146;, daughters&#146; and husband&#146;s
cells that gives young men and women hope that freedom is just across the street.
It&#146;s grandmothers, mothers, wives, sisters and daughters that fuel the revolution. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s Palestinian women that keep the candle of freedom aflame, and
it&#146;s Palestinian women that keep the Intifadah alive. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To all my valiant sisters in Palestine, God bless you this International
Women&#146;s Day. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">A Letter to a Palestinian Boy in the Diaspora</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>The Cactus Road</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Samah Jabr*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dear Naser,</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When I want to think a happy thought during these turbulent days in
Jerusalem, I lie on my bed and think of you and your family and my summer in London. Since
you saw me go off to work and study in the hospital under your father&#146;s guidance, I
thought you&#146;d be interested in what I&#146;m doing now and what you&#146;re missing
here in the land of your heritage, Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My life is an adventure, almost like some of the Harry Potter stories you
and your brothers taught me to enjoy. I start my days by taking trips on what I&#146;ve
come to call &#147;The Cactus Road.&#148; The Cactus Road takes me from our house on the
northern edge of Jerusalem to the al-Khader clinic in a suburb of Bethlehem. If we can
travel on the real road, the distance is only about 25 miles. Even so, it almost always
takes 2 hours to go and 2 hours to return because we have to go through four checkpoints
before we reach our destination. Sometimes I see the checkpoints as mystical obstacles,
knowing well that they are very real. Remember how I used to complain about the smelly,
old underground transport? Well, I never appreciated the London underground like I do
these days. How I wish we had a similar system to speed us along, sparing us daily
encounters with Israeli occupation!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In spite of the difficulties of going through checkpoints and seeing
soldiers with guns eyeing me and those also in the van, I get up every morning eager to
get started. You know me! If presented with an impediment, I&#146;m more determined than
ever to show everyone that I can overcome it. I awake every day wondering whether or not
I&#146;ll go to work on the real road or the Cactus Road. If we&#146;re under closure
(which means that the Israelis have decreed that none of us can leave our narrow housing
compounds no matter what), I know we&#146;ll be going on the Cactus Road. We&#146;ll have
to sneak by soldiers four times in order to get to Bethlehem. Most mornings, just after I
board the van, our driver turns off the main road and bump, bumps along non-roads to get
to our destination. First, we drive up a hill on a dirt road lined with apartment
buildings like the one I live in. Then, we dig our own path into the red soil and move
along endless rows of cacti sending their spiny paddle-like leaves up and out along
barbed-wire fences. The fences are there to protect the old stucco, flat-roofed houses we
pass by. Not surprisingly, many of the owners do not want service vans passing by right
next to their front doors.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Remember when you came to me holding prickly pears your mom had bought to
remind me of home? Remember how you asked me, &#147;How do we eat them?&#148; I laughed
because you looked so Arab, but spoke in a chipper British clip. I peeled two for you and
you liked it. You asked for more. You were so surprised by their sweetness, almost like a
perfume or like the rose water your mother uses in sweets. When I pass by cacti now, I
wish I had told you more about them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the sandy dry land that you&#146;ve never been to, cacti
grow&#151;hearty plants that arm themselves with spikes to protect themselves from animals
who might bite into them and suck them dry. They need all the moisture they can get.
Beside their sabre-like protectors, they send their roots deep into the soil where they
can find water. Sometimes, their leaves have rough brown patches as symbols of an extended
bask in the sun. As cacti age, their bold leaves become damaged with gashes and
rusty-looking scabs made by debris that have blown across their surfaces. They seem to be
all dried out, almost dead, not green and rich. But they are not dead. They live well in
our desert climate in spite of the rough edges left by nature. Then, from time to time,
the sweet fruit you and I shared in London appears, orange or red&#151;the
Palestinian&#146;s favourite colour. With spines less severe than the protective ones on
their leaves, the fruits allow themselves to be picked and eaten. I see these cacti as
symbols of patience and solidarity. Their fruits are a reward for determination and
survival. The cacti are, for me, like rural Palestinian women with deeply lined,
wind-damaged skin. These women watch us pass by the barbed wire surrounding their little
houses, sometimes holding a piece of embroidery cloth onto which they are cross-stitching
the meaning and endurance of their lives. Day in and day out, they come to their doors,
faces lined with hardship, hands caught in their art with red thread and a yet unfinished
embroidery piece symbolizing their culture and their insistence on survival. I&#146;m sure
you would enjoy the ride from my house to Bethlehem, at least for a day or two. But it is
not always enjoyable; it can be risky and dangerous, too. The other morning, the Israeli
soldiers shot at a van of labourers, who were taking the Cactus Road, because they were
travelling on an &#147;illegal road;&#148; one was killed, the rest were injured, but life
went on.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember how you fussed with your parents when they refused to buy you
the computer war game you badly wanted. Your parents were right, that was a violent game
and they were trying to protect you, and you were given a better game by the end of the
day. How much Palestinian parents want to keep their kids away from terror, but war and
violence are reality in Palestine, not just a computer game.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was prompted to write today because a boy your age, just 14, from the
al-Deheishe refugee camp, a suburb of Bethlehem, came to the clinic. He wasn&#146;t the
patient. Instead, he had his 5-year-old brother by the hand. &#147;My mother couldn&#146;t
come; she has to stay with the babies at home,&#148; the older boy explained. The tot had
a runny nose and contagious sore spots on his face like most of the children in the camps.
Both boys were dishevelled and cranky. The boy, like you, reminded me of a rag-a-muffin
Harry Potter. He even wore round glasses. He was, no doubt, a prince, a wizard, at least
in the eyes of his little brother. The Harry Potter look-alike was in a big hurry and he
wanted to get his charge taken care of so that he would not miss a day of school. &#147;We
haven&#146;t had school for days because of the clashes and today school is open. So,
please, doctor, hurry. I just want some salve for his face. See?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Looking into this handsome boy&#146;s eyes, I thought, Naser would call me
the ultimate &#147;Muggle.&#148; I simply do not believe in magic and wizardry. I
don&#146;t count on a kind witch or a good ghost to end the misery and suffering of the
Palestinian boys and girls. No, this boy and his small brother are not in the Harry Potter
world. They are in the real world of Palestine. All I have to give them today is a tube of
&#147;salve&#148;&#151;a word that without one letter would be &#147;save.&#148; But, you,
Naser, have read about evil and redemption in Harry Potter and you have heard the word
Palestine announcing itself on the news, the one word in an Arabic broadcast that you
could understand. My hope lies in you, Naser, and in your parents and others as far away
as London or America or any other spot on the globe. I&#146;m sure you will not forget
that you are in the Palestinian Diaspora. I pray that you and your family will continue
joining others to systematically carry on programmes and activities that will help the
boys and girls here in Palestine&#151;just like the one I joined last summer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For many years, Israelis invited the youth of the Western world, Jews and
non-Jews, to their &#147;kibbutzim&#148;&#151;collective farms they built on land they
took from us. There, they showed unsuspecting visitors, who see only the
&#147;kibbutzim,&#148; what Israeli freedom, co-operation and unity did for the land and
for those who believe that our land is their Zion. These visitors go home with stories
about Israel as &#147;the light in the dark night of the Middle East.&#148; The visitors
do not venture to the tightly packed, taut corners where we live in occupation, watching
and waiting. To them, that would be the dark night the world so fears, the world few want
to see or experience.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, you, Naser, and your brothers and sisters in the Diaspora must be our
ambassadors, our voice we send to the those who close their ears from hearing the
Palestinian cry, and our true picture we send to those who deny us a human face. The
Palestinian future counts on you and all our people who live abroad, as well as those
living in Palestine. If we don&#146;t help ourselves, then who is going to help us? Our
salvation starts from within.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Naser, how much I wish you can come and experience the adventure of the
Cactus Road with me. We need you to do that so you can help us tell our story, too. What
are you going to be when you grow up, Naser, a wizard like Harry Potter, a photographer, a
lecturer, a doctor? It doesn&#146;t matter as long as you remember who you are and where
you came from. Being Palestinian is a gift and an obligation. You&#146;re now 14. I hope
I&#146;ll have a chance to take your hand and share this land of mine and yours with you.
When you come, we&#146;ll eat prickly pear and know that we are home, you and I together.</p>

  <p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Nature of Gush Emunim Settlements</font></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hatred of Arabs and secular Jews has not been solely limited to members of
religious settlements. In his March 11, 1994 article, published in <i>Shishi, </i>Nerri
Horowitz focused upon another group of extremists, called Hardelim.<sup> </sup>Horowitz
analyzed Hardelim&#146;s &#147;twofold hatred of Arabs and secular Jews&#148; and
presented documentation in the form of quotations from their copious and abstruse
literature, filled with cabalistic references. Although esoteric, the literature of the
Hardelim has influenced a majority of religious Jews. (A minority of religious Jews have
opposed the Hardelim advocacy.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nadav Shraggai presented a more popular description of this &#147;twofold
hatred&#148; ideology in his February 18, 1994 <i>Haaretz </i>article. Shraggai pointed to
the renunciation by some religious settlers and other religious Jews of the traditional
prayer for the State of Israel, which was never accepted by the Haredim but said by NRP
followers on every sabbath and religious holiday since 1948. Shraggai noted that some
religious Jews who had previously recognized the State of Israel as holy renounced this
prayer and the holiness of the state; they became convinced that the government and
therefore the state, in accepting Oslo, had &#147;betrayed its sacred mission.&#148; After
concluding that Rabin and his ministers were traitors, the messianists viewed as
particularly offensive the following words of the prayer: &#147;O, God, radiate your light
and truth upon Israel&#146;s leaders, ministers and advisers.&#148; Shraggai correctly
insisted that his analysis focused upon the relatively moderate antagonists. These
moderates contented themselves with intense ideological debate but did not, as did the
extremists, plan and engage in murder and other violent acts. Shraggai wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The personal, ideological and religious crisis in which the
  national-religious Jewish community in Israel has found itself, generated doubts about the
  very foundations of religious Zionism: namely its historic alliance with secular Zionism
  and its wholehearted acceptance of the State of Israel. In the past that alliance revolved
  around the perception that the secular State of Israel was the first stage in the process
  of redemption. At present, even the moderates question this assumption. These doubters do
  not have much in common with radicals like the admittedly marginal Yehuda Etzion of the
  Jewish Underground who opposes any Jewish state that is not a monarchy ruled by the
  Davidic dynasty, or Mordechai Karpel, the founder of the Jewish Nation Exists for Eternity
  movement, which also wants to turn Israel into a theocratic monarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shraggai noted that several influential rabbis, including Azri&#146;el
Ariel who eulogized the assassin Goldstein, led the &#147;moderates.&#148; Shraggai quoted
Rabbi Ariel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The religious settlements were established not only to create facts on the
  ground but also to affect the hearts and minds of the Jewish people. We believed that, by
  encountering the holy parts of the land as if they were alive, the hearts of the Jewish
  masses would be united with the heart of the land. We envisaged the process as
  reconnecting the national Jewish consciousness with its spiritual roots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabbi Ariel further opined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">For a majority of Jews the settlements have failed to restore that sacred
  linkage. The majority of Jews have renounced the Jewish roots present in their souls,
  profaning themselves by [committing the] sin of choosing the so-called
  &#147;morality&#148; of Western culture instead of their own moral values. In the state of
  that grave sin their hearts have remained unaffected by the land of Israel&#133;We now
  have to build the sacred and observant community from within. Let us stop looking out. Let
  us stop to seek pats [that lead] to the hearts of our sinning Jewish brethren. One day,
  those who have effectively abandoned the Jewish religion will find their dreams shattered.
  They will become afflicted by a sense of emptiness. After having faltered on every pat,
  they will come to seek us. Until ten our role will consist of raising a generation of the
  truly chosen and holy ones, a generation capable of receiving Jewish repentant sinners wit
  open arms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In presenting his argument, Rabbi Ariel did not mention Palestinians.
Although presumably realizing that Palestinians on all sides surround their sacred and
observant communities, Rabbi Ariel and others like him have consistently considered
irrelevant the existence of Palestinians; they have concerned themselves wit secular
Jewish Zionists. Shraggai quoted Ariel: &#147;Historic Zionism has reached its end in
bankruptcy ... The real Zionism, the holy one wit profound roots, exists only where the
really religious Jews are living; in the mountains of Judea and the valleys Samaria.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his article Shraggai additionally quoted the articulate settlement
rabbi, Yair Dreyfus. Maintaining that Israel was committing spiritual apostasy by making
an agreement wit the PLO, Rabbi Dreyfus argued further that the finalization of tat
agreement would &#147;mark the end of the Jewish-Zionist era in the sacred history of the
land of Israel.&#148; Dreyfus, as quoted by Shraggai, continued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Historians will record tat the Jewish-Zionist era lasted from 1948 to
  1993. It ended when most Jews had turned into Canaanites. Hence, 1993 marks the beginning
  of the new Canaanite era</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">in that era of sin Jewish political thought, cultural-educational thought
  included, will be polluted by a speedy Arabization. The Jewish left will continue its
  treacherous practices of dismissing Jews from key posts and replacing them wit Arabs. This
  will be done in the government, broadcasting authority, land authority, editorial boards
  of newspapers and boards of university directors. Every important position will be filled
  by an Arab.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although his predictions were not fulfilled after 1993, Rabbi Dreyfus has
remained steadfast in his belief about the new Canaanite era. For him pollution apparently
often resulted when Jews had contact with Gentiles. Rabbi Dreyfus accused secular Jews of
wanting to create a new Israeli-Canaanite personality and thus destroying authentic
Judaism by blending it wit alien elements.&#148; He feared tat this new personality would
eliminate Jewish-Zionist motivation. He accused the Meretz Party of blending Communism
into it and by this process polluting Zionism. This blend, Dreyfus contended, &#147;has
begotten the seed for growth of a new Middle Eastern ethnicity: the Canaanite-Palestinian
pseudo-Jews.&#148; He concluded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The true Jews, desirous to live as Jews, will have no choice but to
  separate themselves in ghettos. The new, sinful Canaanite Palestinian state [Israel after
  Oslo] will soon be established upon the ruins of the genuine Jewish-Zionist state. It will
  not be, as Israel was expected to become by being true to the word of God, a foundation of
  God&#146;s throne on earth. God may even make war against this polluted throne of his. The
  Jews who lead us into that sin no longer deserve any divine protection. We must fight
  those who separated themselves from the true Israel. They have declared a war against us,
  the bearers of the word of God. Our leadership will walk a Via Dolorosa before it
  understands that we are commanded to resist the state of Israel, not just its present
  government. Our cooperation with its agencies can only be based upon a new covenant.
  Without it, we are going to surrender supinely to a government of sin. Instead of doing
  so, we shall pursue a merciless struggle against the Canaanite-Palestinian entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By expressing his opinions openly and forcefully, Rabbi Dreyfus both
represented and influenced the thinking of most religious settlers before and after the
Rabin assassination. Notwithstanding the hostility to Christianity existent in historical
Judaism and religious Zionism, the parallels here to specific Christian theological
formulations are conspicuous.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For secular Israeli Jews, the most important NRP and religious settler
issue has revolved around the penetration of young NRP followers into the combat and elite
units of the army and its officer corps. For nearly twenty-five years after the June 1967
war, this penetration on balance enhanced the image and importance of the NRP in Israeli
society; a kind of partnership between the NRP and the secular majority emerged. The
initiation of the Oslo process, however, provoked some rethinking by many secular Jews and
raised some tough issues. The Rabin assassination heightened apprehension of and aroused
fears about the NRP&#146;s penetration into the military. All of this occurred because of
the strong military character of Israeli Jewish society. This character developed not only
because Jewish males serve in the military for at least three years,<sup> </sup>but also
because they, after finishing their time of duty, continue serving as reservists for one
month each year until the age of fifty-four. The fact that about one-half of all Israeli
Jewish females serve in the military for at least two years additionally contributes to
the shaping of this character. Those who serve in the combat and/or elite units or as
pilots enjoy tremendous social prestige when they leave the service and often are able to
exert political influence. The political weakness of religious parties, especially the
NRP, before 1967 was directly related to the relative absence of religious soldiers in
combat and elite units of the army. This situation changed slowly after 1967. When Gush
Emunim appeared in 1975, its lay leaders and especially its rabbis began educating and
inspiring young NRP followers to adopt the military profession as a religious duty, to
join the combat and elite units of the army and to become officers. Young NRP followers
became dedicated, disciplined and efficient soldiers, ready, if necessary, to sacrifice
their lives for their country. The army high command and a large segment of the Israeli
Jewish population welcomed this development with positive enthusiasm. The NRP thus earned
public appreciation, just as the kibbutz movement had done previously, because of the
excellent military performances of its young members.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Oslo process initiated a change in the almost unqualified admiration
of Gush Emunim and the NRP. Fears arose that NRP followers in the army might refuse to
carry out government orders for Israeli withdrawals from parts of the occupied territories
and/or for the removal of one or more Jewish settlements. The fears expanded following the
Rabin assassination. Even before the assassination, Baruch Kimmerling, in his April 6,
1994 <i>Haaretz </i>article, reflected a bit of the early apprehension and fear. He
discussed the increasing penetration of the Israeli army by religious zealots and the
powerful influence of the religious settlers upon units stationed in the territories.
Kimmerling concluded: &#147;Now it is all important that the army&#146;s command sees to
it that every army unit is supervised. Perhaps those officers and even entire units, which
were for too long involved in negotiations with the religious settlers and in protecting
them and which have in the process developed too much affinity with them, should be
instantly disbanded.&#148; Kimmerling regarded his recommendation as only a stopgap
solution. The army high command did not accept and most of the attentive public ridiculed
the recommendation at that time. Kimmerling recognized that &#147;in the long range&#148;
the problem that had arisen would be insoluble without a deep change in society. He wrote:
&#147;On the one hand, it is difficult to see how the army, having a significant number of
officers adhering to ideology of religious settlers, could evacuate a Jewish settlement.
On the other hand, I find it difficult to imagine how the Israeli army could be
ideologically purified.&#148;</p>
