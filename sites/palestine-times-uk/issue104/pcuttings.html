    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem-</b> In his lifetime, Octav Botnar was one of Britain's richest
    men, a billionaire car importer and, according to British authorities, a tax cheat on a
    grand scale. He was also a philanthropist who showered tens of millions of dollars on his
    favorite causes, which included hospitals, children's funds and the Royal Ballet School.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">After his death in 1998, the money continued to flow from Botnar's estate
    and charitable foundations. Among the beneficiaries were a collection of nonprofit
    organizations in Israel said to represent taxi drivers, students and doctors--and,
    ultimately, Ehud Barak's campaign for prime minister.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The movement of several million dollars in cash contributions from Botnar
    and a variety of other foreign and local donors to Barak's campaign is now the focus of a
    major criminal investigation. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Two groups of American rabbis are quarreling over one of the touchiest
    subjects in the Middle East: Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem and whether during the
    current peace talks Israeli negotiators should offer to share the city with the
    Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The disagreement began Monday when 300 mostly Reform rabbis broke a taboo
    by issuing an open letter calling for a &quot;shared Jerusalem.&quot; They made their plea
    on both practical and moral grounds, arguing in a letter that Palestinians &quot;have
    rights in regard to Jerusalem that are worthy of respect.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A day later, the central bodies of Conservative and Orthodox Judaism
    condemned the letter in a joint statement emphasizing Israel's right to decide its own
    security matters.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Jerusalem is the united and indivisible capital of the State of
    Israel,&quot; wrote the Rabbinical Assembly and the Rabbinical Council of America.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and the Palestinians are unlikely to meet the February 13 deadline
    for agreeing a draft final treaty. The date was set by Ehud Barak, Israeli prime minister,
    as part of his ambitious timetable to have a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement in
    place by next September. Oded Eran, Israel's chief negotiator, said it would be difficult
    to meet the date since there were differences on every item of the final status talks.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">These talks, which include the future status of Jerusalem, Jewish
    settlements in the West Bank, water, borders and the return of refugees, deal with the
    core issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">But yesterday, Mr Eran, former Israeli ambassador to Jordan, said gaps
    remained.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A tide of financial scandal broke over the Israeli political elite
    yesterday, with both the President, Ezer Weizman, and the Prime Minister, Ehud Barak,
    being questioned over alleged funding irregularities.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">After two weeks of hesitating, the attorney-general yesterday ordered a
    criminal investigation into the affairs of Mr Weizman, who has admitted receiving hundreds
    of thousands of dollars from a Monaco-based millionaire. On Wednesday night, the State
    Comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, went to the prime minister's office to question him about
    irregularities in the financing of last year's election campaign following opposition
    accusations.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Washington-</b>With a blunt warning that no side can ever get all it wants
    at the negotiating table, President Clinton on Thursday urged Palestinian Authority
    President Yasser Arafat to refine his priorities for peace talks with Israel,
    concentrating on what is most important and preparing to compromise on the rest. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..&quot;In any process like this, there must be inevitable and difficult

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says he is considering leading the struggle
    for a united Jerusalem as he has done in recent years. The mayor said he is willing to
    cooperate with the Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements but added that he does not want
    them officially recognized as the campaign's leader.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;.. I do not believe that he (Israeli PM Barak) will divide
    Jerusalem. This does not mean, however, that I am not fearful of the steps that others in
    government ministries are taking,&quot;&quot; said Olmert. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The mayor argued that the transfer of civilian authority over Jerusalem's
    Arab neighborhoods to the Palestinian Authority is actually a division of the city. He
    also said he is &quot;&quot;disturbed by the government's helplessness in the face of the
    PA's future operations in the city.&quot;</p>
