<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#0000FF">Will the PA red lines remain red?</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority of Yasser Arafat never misses an opportunity to
emphasize the inviolability of the so-called Palestinian national red lines. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These include full Israeli evacuation from the Palestinian territories
captured in the 1967 war (including first and foremost al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem]), the
dismantling of Jewish settlements, and guaranteeing the estimated four million Palestinian
refugees their inalienable right to return to their ancestral homeland in accordance with
United Nations resolution 194.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this is the very minimum Palestinian political forces and masses
could accept under all circumstances. No Palestinian movement or faction, including the
PA, never voiced willingness that it will accept anything less. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the contrary, there are so many Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims who
rightly won&#146;t accept even these red lines on the ground that stopping at the 1967
armistice line would effectively lend legitimacy to the greatest theft in history, that
being the usurpation of the bulk of Palestine by Zionist gangs and the establishment of
the misbegotten State of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, many Palestinians have come to harbour certain fears of late
that Arafat might be willing eventually to cross the above-mentioned red lines, either
under American and Israeli pressure, or because he wants to have a &#147;State&#148; at
any expense. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, some Palestinian intellectuals, such as the signatories to the
&#147;Petition of 20&#148; in late November, have openly sounded the bell of alarm, and a
far greater number of anxious but suppressed ordinary people seem no longer willing to
give Arafat the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, Palestinians are extremely apprehensive that the Chairman, whose
mental capacity has deteriorated substantially in the last few months, might sign anything
the White House would ask him to sign, and then he could justify this on the ground that
&#147;something is better than nothing&#148; and &#147;we had no choice&#148;&#133;the
same justifications he voiced when he secretly signed the scandalous Oslo Agreement nearly
seven years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, there are certain indications suggesting that Arafat cannot be
trusted not to betray Palestinian expectations and aspirations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the dangerous statement made by President Clinton during
Arafat&#146;s latest visit to the White House on 20 January must be considered. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clinton said the two sides (Israel and the PA) would have to make
difficult decisions and hard choices for peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &#147;neither side should expect to attain 100% of their
goals.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, a simple reading of this statement suggests that Clinton
advocates a &#147;compromise&#148; between Israel and the PA on the West Bank, a sort of
partitioning of the territory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is especially appalling about this is the fact that Arafat and his
sycophantic ministers did not utter a single word in opposition to this dangerous
statement, which practically dropped UN resolutions 242 and 338 as the legal reference to
the peace process, substituting them with &#147;the process.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is another source of anxiety in this regard, and that is the
possibility that the scandalous concessions on Arafat&#146;s part would be sold in a
single package with another lesser, unattractive commodity, namely an independent
Palestinian &#147;State&#148; on a small part of the West Bank&#151;all for the purpose of
confusing the people and creating a false sense of victory and euphoria.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This way, those who would stand against the betrayal of Palestinian rights
would be labelled &#147;enemies of the Palestinian State&#148; and that &#147;they should
look at the half-full, not the half-empty part of the glass.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the declaration of Palestinian Statehood would serve as a
cover, or the cover, for the great sell-out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But even if things turned out as such, the deception and false euphoria
would not last for a long time, even if the United States&#151;the sponsor of the
process&#151;threw its full weight behind Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Because then, Israel would have peace with Arafat, not with the
Palestinian people. Surely, a peace as such would only last for as long as the Chairman
would live. </p>
