<H3><CENTER>What's next after Wye Plantation?</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Khalid Amayreh</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem -</B> At the time of writing this report,
it seemed amply clear that the peace talks at Wye Plantation,
Maryland, would not produce the kind of substantive results that
could re-set the peace process back on track. In fact, in light
of the pessimistic reports coming out of Wye Plantation, and despite
the active intervention in the talks by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
it doesn't seem unlikely that the talks will end up in failure.
In fact, Clinton himself alluded to the virtual dead-end facing
the talks, saying rather diplomatically that &quot;the issues
are difficult-the distrust is deep.&quot;<BR>
This sombre outlook should not surprise serious observers of the
Palestinian-Israeli scene, especially since the coming to power
more than two years ago of the extremist, right-wing Israeli politician
Benyamin Netanyahu. For aside from the mostly artificially induced
&quot;positive&quot; atmosphere and diplomatic pleasantries often
permeating throughout the talks, Netanyahu has virtually remained
faithful to his original adamant rejection of the Oslo Accords
and what they entail, namely a recognition by Israel of a modicum
of Palestinian rights, including prospective Statehood in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<BR>
Indeed, the very concept of withdrawing from even 10% or 13% of
the West Bank, let alone the entire occupied Palestinian territories,
seems starkly incompatible with Netanyahu's mindset. However,
for the sake of public relations expediency, and in order not
to be accused of political parochialism and blind demagoguery,
Netanyahu has chosen political deception and verbal juggling as
his modus operandi to obscure his enduring ideological rejection
of the peace process.<BR>
</P>

<P><B><U>Wye Plantation talks</U></B></P>

<P>The talks at Wye Plantation, preceded by inadequate preparations,
have so far failed to resolve any of the substantive issues, including
the pivotal issue of the second Israeli redeployment from up to
13% of the West Bank. Palestinian sources participating in the
talks stressed that the Israeli delegation did not even present
maps detailing the scope of redeployment. Ahmed Teibi, Yasser
Arafat's advisor on Israeli affairs, said in a radio interview
on the morning of 20 October that the sides were not any closer
to an agreement than they were two weeks ago.<BR>
According to Teibi, five major interim issues were still unresolved.
The first issue concerns the paramount third redeployment, which
according to the Oslo Agreement should culminate in the Israeli
redeployment from the entire West Bank-save East Jerusalem, the
settlements, and military positions, all considered as final status
issues. The Israeli Prime Minister, however, rejects this stipulation,
insisting that Israel alone has the right to determine the extent
and scope of the third redeployment. So far, he insisted that
no more than 1% of the West Bank would be included in the third
phase, which the Palestinian Authority views as a &quot;scandalous
trivialization of the Oslo Accords and a rude attempt to alter
the reference of the peace process.&quot;<BR>
The second issue concerns the Palestinian charter, mainly Israeli
demands to rescind clauses calling for the destruction of the
Jewish State. The issue doesn't seem to be genuine since the PLO
Executive Committee agreed more than three years ago to adopt
the peace process, which arguably overrides the charter since
it is based on the United Nations Security Council resolutions
242 and 338. Never the less, the Israeli Government, aware of
the difficulties facing Arafat in securing a majority in the Palestine
National Council (PNC) has insisted that the charter be amended
before an interim agreement on the second redeployment can be
carried out.<BR>
The third and fourth issues concern security-the sacrosanct cow
of Israeli propaganda. Last year, the Israeli Government and the
PA reached a concordance on all outstanding security issues, including
security coordination under CIA supervision. However, when Netanyahu
found out that he was about to lose one of the most effective
&quot;pressure&quot; cards at his disposal, he withdrew his support
for the concordance, insisting that a new understanding or &quot;security
memorandum&quot; be formulated, conceivably one that would be
too humiliating and too unacceptable for the PA leadership. This
includes imposing draconian measures on Palestinian civilian life
and freedom of expression within the autonomous enclaves, in addition
to handing over scores of Palestinian activists to Israel. Needless
to say, any Palestinian consent to these dictates would seriously
corrode the PA image as a national entity and would irremediably
undermine the authority of President Arafat among the Palestinian
people, since he would be equated with such disreputed Israeli
quislings as Antoine Lahd, commander of the SLA, the Israeli-backed
and -financed Christian militia in the occupied Zone in Southern
Lebanon.<BR>
The fifth issue on which Israel has been equivocating and procrastinating
is the estimated 3,000 Palestinian prisoners languishing in squalid
conditions in Israeli jails. The Hebron agreement, signed a few
months after Netanyahu came to power, stipulated the release of
the prisoners, certainly the vast majority of them. However, the
Netanyahu Government deliberately ignored the issue, opting to
keep it as a pressure card on the Palestinians.<BR>
For its part, the PA leadership is under tremendous public pressure
not to sign any agreement that does not include the liberation
of the prisoners, the suspended martyrs of the Palestinian revolution.</P>

<P><B><U>Hand-grenades in Bir al Saba'a</U></B><BR>
The hand-grenade attack on an Israeli bus carrying Israeli air-force
cadets at Bir al Saba'a central bus station on 19 October provided
the Israeli Government and the Israeli right with additional munitions
to evade the nitty-gritty issues pertaining to redeployment from
13% of the West Bank. It is not known for certain who carried
out the attack, or, indeed, whether it was the work of Palestinians.
The Israeli media seemed to deliberately inflate the casualty
figures in a tendentious manner, ostensibly to vindicate Netanyahu's
security demands at Wye Plantation. This seemed the case by mid-afternoon
on Monday, 19 October, when it became clear that only a handful
of the 67 people reported injured in the incident remained at
the hospital. This, Palestinians charge, raises questions about
the veracity of the Israeli account, and the possibility that
the Israeli Government staged the whole incident for propaganda
reasons.<BR>
But however the truth about the Bir al Saba'a incident may be,
Netanyahu used it to his fullest advantage, saying it vindicated
Israeli security demands. Moreover, Netanyahu reportedly severed
all talks on other issues, insisting that only &quot;security&quot;
ought to be talked about, a feat consistent with Netanyahu's relentless
efforts to block an agreement without bearing the consequences.</P>

<P><B><U>What is next?</U></B><BR>
With the looming failure of the Wye Plantation talks, the Palestinians,
Israelis, as well as people throughout the region, should brace
themselves for more violence in the Palestinian-Israeli arena.
Moreover, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat would come under increasing
pressure to formally declare the establishment of a Palestinian
State in the West Bank. For the Palestinians, the declaration
of Statehood would spell the end of the Oslo Agreement as it has
been known. More important, however, the declaration of the a
Palestinian State would usher the beginning of a new episode of
bitter, and likely bloody, struggle for freedom and liberation.<BR>
Only a political transformation in Israel could reverse this trend,
and this seems unlikely now, given the constant drift to the right
in Israeli society.</P>

<H3><CENTER>They Are Human Too</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ramzy Baroud</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Under what conditions did the Palestinian leadership agree
on the return to the negotiations table? It's a very reasonable
and even expected question to be asked at such a time, considering
our concern for the Palestinian people's welfare.<BR>
Since the beginning of the peace process earlier this decade,
Israel has frequently sealed the progress of any meetings as a
result of several military attacks launched by Palestinian opposition
groups against Israeli targets. The Israeli Government has always
and still carries the belief that the Palestinian leadership is
fully responsible for the act of any individual as long as it's
coming from within the Palestinian-controlled zone. Unsurprisingly,
the Israeli-held ideal has always found open minds and ears from
the United States and other Western allies. As a result, the United
States has continuously demanded Arafat to put an end to &quot;Palestinian
Terrorism&quot; in order for &quot;Peace-making procedures&quot;
to resume.<BR>
Last month, both Palestinian and Israeli teams headed to the United
States to resume their outdated peace agenda, hoping for &quot;the
miracle of Peace&quot; to do its magic. Obviously, Netanyahu is
satisfied enough with the improvement in the security conditions
in the area and with the Palestinian performance to achieve such
a condition.<BR>
In addition to my previous question, I would like to add: Why
doesn't the Palestinian Authority put the same expectations on
Israel regarding the security of the Palestinians before proceeding
with any further talks? Isn't the Palestinian National Authority
aware of the extent of the Israeli violations of human rights
within the Occupied Territories? That is indeed possible if taking
into account how busy they are. I understand that a delegate and
a negotiator has so much to remember and to prepare and very little
time to watch the news or even talk to people in the street. Therefore,
I decided draw up a very short summary on the Israeli aggressive
and inhumane behaviour in the last week alone (5-12 October) hoping
to shed some light on the Israeli hypocritical claim that peace
is their ultimate goal.<BR>
Horia Abu Hamaid, a 40-year-old Palestinian woman from the city
of Hebron, died last week one hour after giving birth. Dr. Mahmoud
Dawoud, the medical manager of Alia hospital, stated later that
day, &quot;Horia had significant bleeding after giving birth,
which required her transfer to a well-equipped hospital. However,
the Israeli soldiers have prevented the ambulance from passing
through the sealed city. A whole hour was lost while the ambulance
was trying to find an alternative route. Tragically, once the
ambulance reached the hospital, Horia was dead.&quot; Horia is
the third Palestinian reported to have died as a result of the
Israeli curfew over Hebron in the last month. <BR>
Israel's barbaric closure on Hebron is continuing. Every day new
stories of the random shootings and beatings permeate the surrounded
city. Hussam Abu Alam, the France Press Palestinian journalist,
is facing death in his hospital room after being severely wounded
by Israeli soldiers. Hussam, who was shot in the neck at close
range, is a new number to be added to the already large number
of journalists and reporters who were intentionally shot or beaten
by angry Israeli soldiers. <BR>
In Ramallah, a 13-year-old Palestinian student was seriously hurt
after being shot in the head while returning home from school.
Jihad Samir Abu Rabi' found himself struggling for his life in
the emergency room for no crime committed. As a matter of fact,
no stone-throwing incidents were reported in the area at that
time (an excuse that otherwise might be used as a justification
for the Israeli soldiers' unjustified shooting).<BR>
Even though the Israeli organized terrorism in Palestinian streets
knows no limits, inside the Israeli prisons the terror is at its
peak. Last week, for instance, the Palestinian prisoner Ahmad
Asfour, who stayed in his cell for an additional four months past
his expected date of release, was found dead. Israel claimed that
Ahmad committed suicide, which is the exact and only explanation
Israel has offered for the hundreds of Palestinians who were killed
under torture at the hands of the Israeli interrogators in the
last 50 years.<BR>
In the mean time, the lawyer of the prisoner Akram Massuda has
announced that Akram was hospitalized several times due to repeated
beatings by Israeli prison guards. Akram was left hanging by his
hands for hours and was not allowed to sleep for days-a destiny
that most and even all Palestinian prisoners have to go through
once they are sent to jail.<BR>
So, my good gentlemen, before you shake hands in Maryland and
before you smile for the cameras and release doves in the polluted
American sky, please remember that Israel cannot be sincere in
its quest for peace while continuing to kill, wound and impose
curfews, as well as torture and beat those who don't deserve such
a cruel destiny. Please remember that the Israeli life is not
more precious than the lives of Horia, Akram, Hussam, Ahmad and
Jihad.....they also matter and they are also beloved.</P>

<H3><CENTER>From national authority to statehood: on the making</CENTER></H3>

<H3><CENTER>and consequences of a Palestinian UDI</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Yom Kippur is one of the most solemn days in the Jewish calendar.
American politicians traditionally use the occasion to flatter
their Jewish constituents. President Harry Truman's Yom Kippur
statement of 4 October 1946 was, unquestionably, one of the most
outstanding examples of this kind of sycophancy. Then, without
any warning or consultation with his British counterparts, the
American President used the occasion to publicly declare his country's
support for a Jewish State in Palestine.<BR>
Whitehall was, understandably, infuriated by the American statement.
Prime Minister Attlee refused to conceal this in his letter to
Truman dated 4 October 1946: &quot;I have received with great
regret your letter refusing even a few hours grace to the Prime
Minister of the country which has the actual responsibility for
the Government of Palestine in order that he might acquaint you
with the actual situation and the probable results of your action.&quot;<BR>
Truman's action had, altogether, three disastrous consequences.
First, it forced the British Government to hastily surrender the
Palestine problem to the United Nations within a matter of months.
Secondly, it cleared the way for the 1947 UN partition of Palestine
and, in the third instance, it enabled the World Zionist Movement
to unilaterally proclaim a Jewish State in Palestine in 1948.<BR>
British outrage with Washington was, however, not confined to
government circles. The London Times in its Editorial of 7 October
1946 declared that the White House statement '...may well compel
people in Britain as well as the Arab countries to the reluctant
conclusion that no solution to the Palestine question will satisfy
the PRESIDENT unless it goes the whole way to meet Jewish claims.&quot;
Since none of these claims were ever satisfied throughout the
last five decades, successive administrations were ruthlessly
cornered into making a catalogue of concessions to the Zionist
lobby on Capitol Hill.<BR>
Against this background, it was only natural that the Israelis
should oppose Yasser Arafat's recent threat to unilaterally proclaim
a State in what remains of occupied Palestine come May 1999. According
to the logic of the Netanyahu regime, such a declaration would
amount to an abrogation of the Oslo accords and, thereby, shatter
all chances of attaining regional peace. Under the circumstances,
therefore, the Americans were summoned on the eve of Yom Kippur
1998 to dissuade the Palestinian leader from his project. The
latter duly complied and, instead of announcing his intention
before the UN General Assembly, chose only to seek the members'
support for the Palestinians in their struggle for a State. <BR>
</P>

<P><B><U>Legitimacy</U></B></P>

<P>In hindsight, the battle-weary Arafat need not have taken this
route. After all, not only did the Palestine National Council
declare the independence of the State of Palestine on 15 November
1988, but moreover, the General Assembly had itself adopted resolution
43/177 acknowledging the State of Palestine that same year. In
recalling its declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples, the world body passed another resolution
(No. 43/178) on 20 December 1988 ordering Israel to terminate
its occupation of Palestinian territory and to protect the economic
and other interests of the Palestinian people. Yet, by failing
to ensure Israeli compliance in this matter, the UN has, evidently,
betrayed the pledge of its Charter to &quot;establish conditions
under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from
treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained...&quot;
As a consequence, one question arises: should a nation which attacks
and occupies a foreign country in the face of UN disapproval be
allowed to impose conditions for its own withdrawal?<BR>
There is, of course, nothing in the current framework of negotiations
which suggests that Palestinian rights will be restored. The preoccupation
with percentages of land, numbers of refugees and size of security
agencies are all geared to overshadow the underlying principles
of legality enshrined in customary and treaty law. Thus, even
if Israeli withdrawals were completed before the end of the interim
period, the Palestinians would still be left with less than 10%
of mandatory Palestine for their future State, one which would,
in reality, be four times smaller than that recommended by the
UN partition resolution No. 181. <BR>
In spite of its infamous partiality toward the Zionists, the Palestinians
have never surrendered their right to the territory outlined in
the partition plan. Hence, the proclamation of an independent
Palestinian State will naturally find legitimacy in resolution
181, regardless of its shape or size. A return to this resolution
would, furthermore, enable the Palestinians to claim all the lands
allocated for the Arab State in 1947. The obvious drawback from
such a course of action, however, would be an implicit recognition
of Israel, which links its own legitimacy to this resolution.
Needless to say, though, that the PLO had already granted this
recognition as a precondition for the signing of the Declaration
of Principles on 13 September 1993.</P>

<P><B><U>What kind of State?</U></B></P>

<P>While some Palestinians view the declaration of a State as
a stepping stone toward the full restoration of their rights,
there has, nevertheless, been genuine and growing concern about
the nature of the State envisioned. Broadly speaking, a State
comes into being when an organization or group exercises sovereignty
over a piece of territory and when their claim to Statehood is
accepted by the people of that territory and other States in the
world. Given the threats by Israel to reoccupy the West Bank if
a Palestinian State is unilaterally declared, it must be emphasized
that a State's existence does not require absolute sovereignty
in relation to other States. Hence, it is quite possible to have
a Palestinian State even if Israel refuses to recognize it.<BR>
Although the future State will, assuredly, have a flag and a national
anthem, the chances of it having an army are almost nil. Israel
has, time and again, insisted that the State of Palestine must
be devoid of the least capability to undermine or threaten its
security. Thus, whatever it takes, the new State must be completely
demilitarized, very much like Finland and Costa Rica, and more
importantly, run by Palestinians acceptable to both America and
Israel.<BR>
Of course, the sponsors of this settlement could not care less
about Palestinian public opinion on this. For ever since the Balfour
Declaration right through to the Oslo accords, they played absolutely
no role in determining any of the political arrangements that
affected their destiny and that of their country. Their continued
exclusion from the political process has, ostensibly, been rooted
in the assumption made by Chaim Weizmann during a meeting with
President Roosevelt in 1944 that &quot;...we could not rest our
case on the consent of the Arabs; as long as their consent was
asked, they would naturally refuse it.&quot; Thus, unlike the
people of northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, who enjoy the
right to debate their future in an open and democratic process,
the fate of the Palestinians must remain perpetually subject to
the secret deals of politicians and security agencies from other
countries. <BR>
Admittedly, those Palestinians who oppose the looming settlement
would find their presence in a West Bank State quite distressing.
Far from of being a secure base from which to reclaim lost territory,
the new State would make it considerably easy for the Israelis
to suppress Palestinian irredentism. For whereas in the past they
randomly attacked the refugee camps to weed out so-called &quot;terrorists&quot;,
killing more often than not innocent civilians, now they could
target the government buildings, institutions, and economic installations
of the infant State.<BR>
On the question of the refugees, the proclamation of a Palestinian
State may further complicate their already complex and tragic
lives. As recent studies suggest, the vast majority who did not
originate from the West Bank and Gaza Strip would not want to
return there. Ultimately those refugees who insist on returning
to their original homes and villages will become more vulnerable
to abuse as host countries attempt to reduce or even rid themselves
altogether of their foreign guests.<BR>
The fate of Jerusalem is no more promising than that of the refugees.
Both the Palestinians and Israelis are doggedly committed to having
it as the capital of their State. In order to resolve these conflicting
claims, some commentators have suggested that East Jerusalem should
be the capital of Palestine while West Jerusalem be that of Israel.
Not surprisingly, the Israelis have outrightly rejected this proposal
because they, like the Americans, maintain that the city should
remain &quot;unified.&quot; They both have, accordingly, taken
several drastic measures that have significantly damaged Palestinian
interests in the city. Under the dubious guise of the term &quot;Greater
Jerusalem&quot;, Israel has effectively annexed 12% of the West
Bank taking in the process Gush Etzion, Bethlehem, south Hebron
and al Khan al Ahmar (Ma'aleh Adumim). In the same manner, the
United States has, likewise, further compounded the problem of
Jerusalem by its decision to transfer its embassy to the western
part of the city. This, according to Walid Khalidi, is the supreme
expression of recognition. Given the unique status of the city,
Israel's creeping Anschluss of Jerusalem may, like the Nazi annexation
of Austria, plunge this entire region into yet another inferno
of war and destruction.<BR>
When Britain decided to surrender the Palestine question to the
United Nations in 1947, the World Zionist Organization was no
longer in need of the Balfour Declaration. It was only a matter
of time before they unilaterally declared the establishment of
a Jewish State in Palestine. Five decades later, the wheel of
history has turned 360 degrees. With the end of the Oslo transitional
period nearing its end, the Palestinian National Authority has
announced its intention to unilaterally proclaim its State in
May 1999. Israel's categorical opposition to the declaration has
reaffirmed certain fundamental and bitter truths about this century-old
conflict. <BR>
That important though it be, the declaration of a State is not
the only national objective of the Palestinian people. For what
good would such an entity serve if Israel is able to perpetuate
its policies of discrimination, exploitation, dispossession and
repression in its relations with the new entity. True it is highly
probable that the political negotiators will arrive at a kind
of Camp David agreement in the near future. The crucial difference
here is that the West Bank is not like the Sinai where an Israeli
military withdrawal will suffice. Palestinian aspirations to independence
and development cannot be realized in a subordinate or disproportionate
political and economic 'partnership' with Israel. Hence whatever
garments the new State may adorn, authentic national sovereignty
will have to be based on the popular will of all the Palestinian
people in the territories as well as in their places of Stateless
refuge.<BR>

<P>Though on 23 October, 1998, an historic peace agreement was
signed between the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu at the Wye Summit in Maryland,
the joint implementation of a real and comprehensive peace is
yet to be seen.<BR>
It is impossible for a hawk to become a dove. The appointment
of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister is yet another obstacle
to true peace. But then, many former Jewish terrorists have been
honored in Israel and given prominent positions of power. <BR>
As early as 14 October 1953, an Israeli unit, under the command
of Ariel Sharon attacked the Palestinian village of Qibya then
under Jordanian rule. As a result of this attack, sixty-six men,
women and children were murdered.<BR>
In August of 1981, Prime Minister Menechem Begin's &quot;iron
fist&quot; policy was given a facelift when Ariel Sharon ordered
soldiers to refrain from breaking into schools to quell demonstrations,
to avoid collective punishment, and to be more sensitive at checkpoints
and roadblocks. Sharon's strategy was to create an alternative
leadership that would negotiate on Israeli terms. Sharon wanted
to impose an autonomy for the Palestinians but not for their land.
By the autumn of 1981, universities had been re-attacked, protesters
killed in the streets and collective punishment, including home
demolitions and harsh curfews, reinstated.<BR>
In a bid to gain the approval of the U.S. Administration for the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon, General Ariel Sharon, then defense
minister of Israel, visited Washington. The purpose of the invasion
was to destroy the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) whose
headquarters at that time were in Lebanon and to scatter the Palestinian
refugees whose camps were to the north and east of Israel. As
a result, in the first three months of 1982, there was a massive
surge of military supplies from the U.S. to Israel while Israel
planned the invasion of Lebanon.<BR>
American delivery of goods to Israel was almost 50% greater than
the preceding year including equipment used in Lebanon. Such equipment
as &quot;smart bombs&quot; was employed with devastating effect
in Beirut. One such bomb caused the instant destruction of an
entire building, killing 100 people in an apparent attempt to
get rid of the now Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was
thought to be there.<BR>
The massacres at the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon
were to bring about the planned displacement of the Palestinian
civilians. A military correspondent of Haaretz Hebrew newspaper
on September 28, 1982 confirmed that it was a joint Israeli-Lebanese-Phalangist
strategy aimed at &quot;effecting a mass exodus by the Palestinians
from Beirut and Lebanon.&quot;<BR>
While the actual operation was carried out by the Lebanese Phalange,
responsibility for the massacre of from 3,000 to 3,500 victims
who were not fighting men, but mostly women and children, rests
on the shoulders of Israelis who planned it and on the United
States who had guaranteed the safety of the inmates of the two
camps after the PLO departed from Lebanon.<BR>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon is a war criminal because
of the leading role he took in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
in 1982. He was found indirectly responsible by an Israeli commission
of inquiry for the massacre of thousands of Palestinians in Beirut's
Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.<BR>
That PA president Yasser Arafat stated he was &quot;ready&quot;
to shake hands with Sharon during a brief stopover at Helsinki-Vantas
airport where he held talks with Finnish President Marti Ahtisaari
overnight is not only surprising, but also shocking.<BR>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Al Khatib echoed Arafat's
sentiment that the Israeli appointment is &quot;an internal Israeli
matter.&quot; However, the Gulf press contrasted sharply with
the tone of the Palestinian president and Jordan. The Qatari newspaper
Al Raya rightfully called Sharon &quot;the butcher of Sabra and
Shatila.&quot; Another Qatari newspaper, Al Watan branded him
&quot;the Palestinians' most implacable enemy and the most hateful
Jew.&quot;<BR>
Other Middle Eastern countries agreed that Sharon's appointment
would hamper and compromise the peace process in the long run.
Ariel Sharon has served as a member of the Israeli cabinet under
Begin, for a time as Minister of Defense. And later when his resignation
was forced, by the Israeli commission investigating the massacres
at Sabra and Shatila, from the defense ministry for his &quot;indirect
responsibility&quot; for the atrocities committed, he served as
a minister without portfolio. Let it not be forgotten that the
purpose of the Sharon Plan (which was deArabization of Palestinian
lands and the consequent Judaization of them) was to create a
Palestinian state in Jordan. Sharon's strategy has always been
to evict and/or kill those Palestinians living in what remains
of Palestine. In September 1970 (during the Jordanian civil war)
there was a debate in the Israeli army whether it should respond
to the purposed Syrian invasion of Jordan. Sharon told Time magazine
then, &quot;...I don't mean that if we had a Palestinian state
in Jordan we would have good neighbors. There would be a bitter
conflict, but the conflict would be over territory, not over the
right of Palestinians to exist as a nation. King Hussein is not
a partner in the Camp David talks. I don't mind who takes over
Jordan.&quot;<BR>
His hands are indelibly stained with the blood of thousands of
innocent Palestinians. How can a hawk and a mass murderer ever
become a dove? What optimism can there be for the future of the
peace process when such a person has been named to the post of
foreign minister of Israel? Ariel Sharon is an enemy of peace
and one of the monsters that the Frankenstein America has created.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Day I Accused Ariel Sharon</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Nasser Khasawneh*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>There was something surreal about Ariel Sharon's statements
that he would not shake Arafat's hand if he were appointed foreign
minister. The sense of the extraordinary was accentuated by the
subsequent announcement that Sharon was actually appointed foreign
minister of Israel-the country that prides itself on being &quot;an
oasis of democracy&quot; in the authoritarian desert of the Arab
world. In the midst of all this insanity, I remembered the day
I saw Sharon in person over seven years ago.<BR>
I only took part in a peaceful demonstration twice in my life,
both times in England. The first protest was against Ariel Sharon.
An Arab friend called me the night before to ask me to take part
in a demonstration to be held in front of the Oxford Union Society;
Sharon had been invited to address the Society by an extremist
group of Jewish students. <BR>
Early the next morning, I walked with great unease to the Society's
building. I was soon to see first hand the man who-in the eyes
of Arabs, independent commentators across the world and the majority
of Israelis-is a war criminal; the man whose arrogant face I first
saw as a child in the news coverage of the litany of massacres
left in the wake of Israel's invasion of Lebanon. For if there
ever was one defining moment in my political consciousness, it
is without a doubt the summer of 1982. I remember with absolute
clarity my utter disbelief, that of an 11-year-old, at the blatant
atrocities committed by the Israeli army and the cowardice of
most Arabs who just watched or, at best, gave useless fiery speeches
to clear their discredited consciences. <BR>
As I approached the site of the demonstration, I was sure of the
kind of crowd that awaited me. I expected a mix of a few Arabs
and Muslims. I was just hoping that the size of the crowd would
not be derisory; Arab students abroad tend to have an obsessive
fear of any form of political action, even if it is directed at
one of their Governments' enemies. When I arrived, I was totally
surprised to find that the number of Jewish and Israeli demonstrators
outnumbered that of the Arabs. I was then further struck by the
gregarious nature in which the Israelis and Arabs were mingling,
at a time well before Oslo and the Jordanian/Israeli peace treaty.
We were all united for a moment-united in our disgust and opposition
to the actions of this war criminal, whose presence in our university
we regarded as a sacrilege. <BR>
On that cold morning, fear of terror brought us together. In order
to illustrate poignantly the extent of the protesters' unity,
one of those present suggested that the Palestinian and Israeli
flags be held up jointly, side by side, in defiance of our unwelcome
visitor. To make the point even more strongly, it was decided
that an Arab student should carry the Israeli flag and an Israeli
the Palestinian flag. I remember the hesitation of an Arab protester
as he was asked to carry the Israeli flag. He looked to ensure
that a Jewish student was sticking to his side of the bargain.
The Arab protester saw for the first time in his life an Israeli
carrying a Palestinian flag; he subdued his hesitation and proceeded,
albeit reluctantly, to hold the Israeli flag.<BR>
The car carrying the war criminal and his hosts stopped at the
bottom of the road leading to the Oxford Union Society. Sharon,
and an extremist companion wearing a smug look for the morning,
walked up the road. I don't recall having been instructed on the
form of protest we should direct at Sharon. But the minute Sharon
was in our sight, a deep silence swept our group. Then, in unison.
each of us lifted his right arm and pointed the index finger at
Ariel Sharon. We just stood there, proud of our common stand against
terror and one of its greatest mongers this century. We pointed
the finger of accusation at a visibly dumbstruck Ariel Sharon.
He might have expected a few Arab hecklers, but nothing had prepared
him for the sight of a Jew carrying a Palestinian flag and pointing
the finger of accusation in his face. Our hands stretched out,
unwavering, until Sharon entered the safety of the Society's building.<BR>
On that cold morning, we accused Ariel Sharon. We accused him
of the murder of 17,825 innocent persons, and the infliction of
grievous injuries on another 30,000 innocent persons, during the
invasion of Lebanon (according to sources quoted by the Library
of Congress). We accused him of inciting, aiding and abetting
the massacre of &quot;well over a thousand people&quot; in Sabra
and Shatilla (according to the most conservative estimates quoted
by Robert Fisk in Pity the Nation, Lebanon at War, Oxford University
Press, 1990).<BR>
Months after that protest, I attended a lecture on war crimes
given by one of my law professors. The British professor ended
her talk by listing a few persons whom she regarded as undisputed
war criminals; she told us that any law-abiding citizen of the
world has the right to arrest these persons on sight. The first
name on that ignominious list was that of Israel's new foreign
minister.<BR>
I wonder which part of Sharon's illustrious record of achievements
Benyamin Netanyahu was referring to when he announced his appointment.
Netanyahu said, and I quote, &quot;Sharon is the most fitting
person in the State of Israel for the position of foreign minister.
He brings with him rich experience, creativity and proven working
ability.&quot; Are Sharon's actions in Lebanon indicative of &quot;rich
experience&quot;, or perhaps they attest to &quot;proven working
ability&quot;? As for &quot;creativity&quot;, I believe Netanyahu
must have been referring to some of Sharon's more recent statements
on how to deal with the current crisis with the Palestinians and
neighbouring Arab countries. For example, let us take the following
strikingly creative suggestion by Sharon on how to best handle
the Lebanese problem: &quot;Bridges should be destroyed and cars
should stand still and maybe then Lebanon will understand.&quot;<BR>
Sharon's appointment and Netanyahu's laudatory remarks announcing
it are an insult to all Arabs and Israelis alike, including those
who stood with us pointing the finger of accusation that morning
in England. But as always, the Arab reaction, or non-reaction
to be more accurate, has been astonishing. <BR>
The man who has massacred nearly 20,000 Arabs, according to the
estimates of Arab and non-Arab sources, has the audacity to prescribe
conditions to his participation in the peace process. And what
is worse, he found no Arab official to respond to him in kind.
The foreign minister of an Arab country, when asked to comment
on the appointment of Sharon, responded listlessly that this was
a mere internal Israeli affair.<BR>
This is no internal Israeli affair. This is an affair about the
illicit invasion of a country and the massacres committed by the
leader of that invasion. This is an affair about innocent lives
that lay crushed by tanks on Arab soil 16 years ago. Even the
Kahan commission, formed by the Israeli Government to investigate
the Sabra and Chattila massacres, reached the conclusion that
Sharon bore &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for the atrocities,
and further requested that Begin, then-Prime Minister of Israel
and Sharon's blood brother of sorts, fire Sharon from his Government
post. <BR>
I call on Arab officials to defy Sharon like we did as a bunch
of students seven years ago. I call on them to honour the memory
of all those innocent lives this man destroyed. I call on them
to accuse Sharon of crimes against humanity, of which his own
people and legal system have already convicted him. And if these
officials cannot help but meet Sharon in person, I remind them
of my law professor's advice: Don't forget the handcuffs.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Jerusalem during the Muslim rule</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Jerusalem was conquered by the Muslims on Rabi' al-Akhir (May)
of 16 Hijra (637 CE). The conquest put an end to centuries of
instability, religious persecution and colonial rule under the
previous ruling parties, namely the Egyptians, the Greeks, the
Persians and the Romans. The Muslim army, which had just finished
conquering the province north of Ash-Sham and consolidated its
success with a victory at Al-Yarmouk, marched toward Jerusalem
and imposed a siege around it, thereby conquering it.<BR>
Having been made aware of the defeat of his empire's army at Al-Yarmouk,
the Roman governor of the Holy City fled and left the original
inhabitants to negotiate a peaceful surrender to the Muslims.
Jerusalemites wanted a peace treaty similar to the ones concluded
by the Muslims with the inhabitants of other towns in the region,
save for one extra condition-they asked that the leader of the
Muslims-Omar-be present to take delivery of the city. As soon
as the news arrived in Medina, Omar prepared for the journey to
Jerusalem and asked Ali ibn Abi Talib to take charge of Medina
during his absence.<BR>
It has been suggested that the insistence on the presence of Omar
emanated from the desire on the part of the leaders of the Jerusalemites
to ensure that guarantees for the safety and security of Christian
shrines be given by the most senior figure in the Islamic State.
There is abundant historic evidence that the peoples of conquered
regions, and Jerusalem was no exception, had heard of the piety
and justice of Omar and of the strict adherence of Muslims to
the values they preached. The conduct of the Muslims during their
conquest campaign convinced many natives that this was not another
colonial power.<BR>
On the eve of Al-Yarmouk battle between the Muslims and the Roman
army, the Roman commander instructed a native Arab informer to
infiltrate the Muslim camp and come back to him with a description
of their conditions. The informer returned with the most astonishing
report. He said, &quot;I have come to you from a people who spend
the night in worship and the day in fasting. They enjoin good
and forbid evil. They are priests at night and lions during the
day. If their leader were to commit an act of theft, they would
not hesitate to cut his hand, and if he were to commit adultery,
they would not stand short of stoning him. They sanctify truth
and give it preference over personal desire.&quot; Reportedly,
the commander of the Roman army responded by saying, &quot;If
such is their description, then the bottom of the earth is better
than its top.&quot; In other words, he feared that a people with
such character just could not be defeated. To the natives of Palestine,
the Muslims were a new breed of humans, different from all those
who invaded their country before. They watched the newcomers as
they communicated with each other and as they dealt with their
adversaries. The Muslim worriers had strict instructions to violate
no sanctity and to hurt no innocent creature. A farewell admonition
from Caliph Abu Bakr to one of the departing armies toward Jerusalem
read as follows:<BR>
&quot;I recommend to you that you fear Allah and obey Him. When
you engage the enemies and win over them, do not loot, do not
mutilate the dead, do not commit treachery, do not behave cowardly,
do not kill children, the elderly or women, do not burn trees
or damage crops and do not kill an animal unless lawfully acquired
for food. You will come across men confined to hermitages in which
they claim to have dedicated their lives to worshipping God-leave
them alone. When you engage the pagan infidels, invite them to
choose between two things: invite them to embrace Islam. If they
do not wish to do so, invite them to pay the jizyah (tax paid
by non-Muslims in a conquered land). If they accept either, accept
it from them and stop fighting. But if they reject both, then
fight them.&quot; The lessons native inhabitants learned every
day from the conquering army were crowned with the amazing experience
of watching the arrival of the leader of the Muslims from Medina-the
second caliph Omar Ibn Al-Khattab. He had with him one companion,
not a servant or a slave, but a friend with whom he shared one
camel for the entire journey. The garment Omar had been wearing
had been torn and soiled. He took some time to patch it and clean
it. He was advised upon his arrival that this was not a very impressive
scene for the locals who were used to seeing kings and emperors
well dressed and well guarded. He answered, &quot;We are a people
whom Allah has empowered with Islam. We do not seek the pleasure
of other than Allah.&quot;<BR>
The arrival of Omar in Jerusalem signalled the beginning of a
new era during which the city of Jerusalem became an open city.
Only during the times of non-Muslim rule did the city lose its
sanctity and openness. The secret lies in Islam itself. On the
one hand, Islam considers itself an extension of the divine messages
that preceded it. All the messengers and prophets that preceded
Muhammad (peace be upon him) are recognized and respected, as
well as their followers-the Muslims; and the followers of Muhammad
are ordered to believe in them all and to respect them as much
as they respect their own prophet. The Qur'an calls on the believers
to proclaim: &quot;We believe in God, and in that which has been
bestowed from on high upon us, and in that which has been bestowed
upon Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants,
and that which has been vouchsafed to Moses and Jesus, and that
which has been vouchsafed to all the [other] prophets by their
Lord: we make no distinction between any of them (The Holy Qur'an,
2:136). On the other hand Islam awards to the followers of both
Judaism and Christianity rights, the violation of which is considered
a sin. The Prophet is reported to have said, &quot;He who harms
a dhimmi, it is as if he harms me personally.&quot;<BR>
Although Islam unequivocally condemns those who have altered their
own divine messages to suit their own personal interests or in
order to deny the divine mission of Prophet Muhammad (peace be
upon him), Islam guarantees the freedom of worship for the followers
of both Judaism and Christianity. This is evident in the declaration
signed by Omar upon his entry into the Holy City. He pledged that
the Muslims should guarantee the security of the inhabitants of
the city, of their wealth, of their churches and of their crosses.
He also guaranteed that their churches would not be taken from
them nor would they be demolished or undermined in any way, that
none of their possessions would be seized from them and that they
would not be compelled to change their religion.<BR>
The pledges given to the Christians applied similarly to the Jews,
except that the Jews had not at the time of conquest been living
in the Holy City. Relations between the Jews and the Christians
were extremely bitter-a product of the Roman persecution of Jews,
which long predates the conversion to Christianity by Emperor
Constantine in 325 CE but which continued for many centuries thereafter.
Between the years 132 CE and 135 CE, the Jews of Jerusalem rebelled
against the Roman rule only to be vanquished and banished in the
earth by Emperor Hadrian, who forbade them from ever returning
to the Holy City. Jews returned to the city only when the Muslims
took hold of it, thus opening it to all believers.<BR>
Although at the dawn of Islam Muslims had a conflict with the
Jewish tribes that had been living in and around Medina and later
on in Khaibar, they did get along very well at all times thereafter,
and especially in Palestine. For both Jewish and Christian inhabitants
of the conquered lands, Islamic rule signalled the start of a
golden age. Territories under Muslim rule became safe havens to
which many Jews and Christians fled to escape persecution in their
own homelands. It was in the Muslim metropolis that many Christians
and Jews found the opportunity to acquire learning and to excel
in various fields of knowledge and expertise. Many of them had
become historic figures who benefited from as well as contributed
greatly to the Arab Muslim civilization. In addition to recognizing
both Judaism and Christianity as divine faiths whose prophets
preached the same message that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was
sent to complement and seal, Muslims are warned against the attitude
of self-appointed judges over people's hearts and choices of faith.
Although Muslims disagree fundamentally with Jews and Christians
over matters of faith, they are supposed to accept that faith
is a matter between man and his creator and that, notwithstanding
the differences, a common ground exists where Muslims and other
believers may stand.<BR>
&quot;And dispute not with the People of the Book, except in the
best way, unless it be with those who initiate aggression against
you. But say: We believe in the Revelation which has come down
to us and in that which came down to you; our God and your God
is One; and it is to Him we submit (The Holy Qur'an, 29:46).<BR>
A Muslim's duty is to invite others, through wisdom and peaceful
admonition, to what he believes to be the truth. But no Muslim,
including the Prophet himself, has the authority to compel another
human being to accept what Muslims believe to be the truth. It
is, however, the responsibility of Muslims in this life to establish
an order of justice in which human dignity is protected and freedom
of choice is guaranteed. It is not surprising, hence, that the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did not perceive the Muslims to be conquerors
but rather rescuers who came to deliver them from persecution
and enslavement.<BR>
Furthermore, Muslims are ordered to observe justice in their dealings,
whether among themselves or between them and others. &quot;O you
who believe! Stand firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing,
and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong
and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear
Allah. For Allah is well acquainted with all that you do&quot;
(The Holy Qur'an, 5:8). In addition, Muslims are prohibited from
abusing the symbols of other faiths, no matter how much these
symbols contravene the basic tenets of the Islamic creed.<BR>
&quot;Revile not those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest
they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance&quot; (The Holy
Qur'an, 6:108). The status of Jerusalem under Muslim rule is best
contrasted with its status under the rule of the Crusaders, who
occupied it for about 88 years between 1099 CE and 1187 CE. In
seven days, the Crusaders killed no less than 70,000 of the city's
inhabitants. No distinction was made between Muslim and Jew. All
those who did not share the faith of the invaders, including many
local Christians, were considered heathens, the killing of whom
was the religious mission the invaders came from afar to fulfil.
Muslim symbols in the city were completely obliterated: the Al
Aqsa mosque was turned into a barracks for the troops and its
basement into a stable for their horses.<BR>
The call to prayer was banned and the minarets of Jerusalem were
silenced for 88 years. The peace, tranquility and openness of
the Holy City were restored only when Salah-u-ddin Al-Ayyoubi
liberated it from its foreign intruders. Peace prevailed so long
as Islamic rule continued. This lasted until the turn of this
century when Jerusalem, like the rest of Palestine, was placed
under the mandate of the British, who used their power to alter
the demographic nature of the country in preparation for the creation
of a Jewish State in Palestine. Since then, Zionists have resorted
to all sorts of measures to force the Palestinians out of the
city and to obliterate all non-Jewish symbols. Yesterday's victims
have become today's oppressors. Haunted by their bitter experience
in Europe, Zionist Jews have gone as far as pursuing the policy
of their own oppressors, the Nazis.<BR>
Never will Jerusalem's peace and openness be restored unless Islamic
rule is reinstated. Only the Muslims are guaranteed to respect
the sacredness of the city and observe its central position, not
only to their faith, but also to the faiths of Christians and
Jews. The crimes committed by the Zionists in Palestine are reminiscent
of those perpetrated by the Crusaders almost nine centuries ago.
Today's slogans and justifications of aggression are not much
different from those of yesterday. Both the Crusaders and the
Zionists claimed to fulfil a divine mission of some sort. Flying
on a mythical carpet of divine promises, they came from afar to
rob, murder, destroy and disturb. In both cases, the invaders
were motivated by greed and hatred and were driven to their doom
by blind faith in some incredible myths. In both cases, the weakness
of the Muslims helped the invaders achieve their goals.<BR>
Just as the crimes and barbarity of the Crusaders brought an end
to their rule on its 88th anniversary, so will the crimes of the
Zionists bring an end to their project, perhaps just before they
celebrate their 88th anniversary. Just as the return of Muslims
to their faith marked the beginning of the end of the Crusader
campaign, it is today's return to their faith by the Muslims,
despite all the hurdles, that promises a close ending of the current
painful chapter in the history of the Holy City.<BR>
The day the Zionist project comes to an end will be the day when
peace and freedom of worship are restored in Jerusalem and when
the Holy City will be re-opened to all believers from all faiths.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Zionist Myths</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Zaid O. Nabulsi</B></CENTER></P>

<P>In a recent 'no-expenses-spared' advertising campaign to lure
more Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel, Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu stated: &quot;The reason is simple. It's what we are
here for: the ingathering of the exiles. Having renewed Jewish
sovereignty in the land of the Jews, we want to bring Jews to
Eretz Yisrael.&quot;<BR>
A few days ago, while addressing the United Nations, Netanyahu
told the world: &quot;This extraordinary recognition by the international
community confirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt
for two millennia-that the bond between the People of Israel and
the Land of Israel is eternal, and that the rebirth of the Jewish
State in the Land of Israel is an historic imperative.&quot;<BR>
Referring to the West Bank as Judea and Samaria, he added: &quot;[T]his
land is the canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish history
have been etched. Every stone, every hill, every valley resonates
with our forefathers' footsteps.&quot;<BR>
One of the lingering tragedies of this century was indeed perpetrated
under the pretext of the Zionist myth of &quot;the Promised Land&quot;;
the belief that the land of Palestine was promised by God to become
the eternal homeland for the Jewish people.<BR>
It is sometimes very tempting to get carried away, amidst the
prevalent falsification of the origins and history of the Palestinian
tragedy, and actually start accepting some of the lies that are
being told. For there has been over the last half century a deliberate
and overwhelming campaign of obfuscation of the simple facts lying
at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict-aided and abetted by
a conscience-stricken, and too often indifferent, imperialist
West. The concerted global effort at misinformation and deception
has succeeded in transforming one of the simplest and most blatant
acts of theft and dispossession into one of the seemingly most
complex territorial disputes in history. On the ground where it
matters, the Palestinian plight has been obscured to insignificance.
<BR>
Today, the Palestinian cause is being drowned in a pitiful and
irrelevant quagmire over Israeli withdrawals from percentages
of percentages of non-viable and unsustainable, tiny, self-ruled
cantons. Meanwhile, the economic and social condition of the majority
of the Palestinian people is catastrophic, to say the least. In
the resulting confusion, the essence of the Palestinian tragedy
has been completely overlooked and forgotten. In such a situation,
there is nothing more difficult than re-defining the obvious and
illuminating the truth. There is nothing more difficult than un-telling
the lies and invalidating the myths. Indeed, it is an exacting
task to ask the world to return to its sanity, to ask people to
become human again. But at the same time, nothing is more condemnable
than accepting this situation by refraining from speaking out.
When you hear Israelis and Zionists so fervently express their
God-given religious right to &quot;return to their land&quot;
after spending a millennia in &quot;exile&quot;, with absolute
obliviousness to the fate of the Palestinian inhabitants of that
land, you cannot help but wonder at the sort of hypnotic spell
that completely paralyses the listener from pointing out the monstrous
absurdity of this argument and the horrendous implications of
its flawed logic. When you hear such people casually repeat that
they &quot;spent thousands of years away from home&quot;, the
obviously ludicrous presumption should be immediately detected:
any human being's life-span hardly ever exceeds one century, and
unlike the Palestinian refugees-who still carry the keys to their
robbed and confiscated houses and farms-no living Jew can profess
to remember what it was like when his ancient ancestors supposedly
lived in Palestine thousands of years ago. Unlike today's Palestinians,
who have been living in Palestine without interruption for the
last 14 centuries, no living Jew can claim to long for returning
to a land which neither him nor any of his living family or memorable
ancestors have ever inhabited. Unlike the Palestinians, who were
forcibly uprooted from their homes and livelihoods, no living
Jew can claim to have endured any kind of suffering whatsoever
by virtue of being banished from any form of habitation of the
land of Palestine. Yet such absurdity is being propagated the
whole time by respectable and intelligent people the world over.
<BR>
The &quot;Promised Land&quot; argument is constantly reiterated
with zealous conviction everyday by politicians, soldiers, rabbis,
historians, settlers, journalists and all other Israelis and Zionists
alike. What is striking is that the audience for such absolute
folly are not flabbergasted by its immense insanity as they ought
to be. For there is no more twisted logic than that which lays
biblical claims that are thousands of years old to ownership of
an inhabited land in order to take it over and drive its population
into exile or subhuman existence. There cannot be any more chaotic
and ridiculous consequences that can result from the application
of such logic in the world today. Any form of logical deliberation
over this concept is instantly murdered when your adversaries
imagine that they hold a direct promise for its implementation
from the Almighty Himself. Indeed, history has taught us, there
is nothing more poisonous and destructive to humanity than a baseless
and oppressive idea whose proponents self-righteously proclaim
to represent and enact the will of God. This outrageous biblical
argument of the &quot;Promised Land&quot; has been tirelessly
repeated in so many instances and at each available opportunity
that rational and ordinary people in the West seem to have grown
immune to its utter incoherence and are no longer able to see
through its very flimsy moral texture.<BR>
It is baffling to witness how such a lapse of rudimentary logical
aptitude can plague an entire civilization and become universally
digestible. But this is not without a good explanation. The atrocious
crimes committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish people have
had an immeasurable impact upon the Jewish cause, and especially
upon their quest to establish an independent State. Continuously
and manipulatively reminding the world of the ugliness of the
Holocaust has meant that the price of establishing such a State
would always become justifiable-no matter what side-effects it
may entail. Whenever the Western world would come close to considering
the toll of the inhumane policies of the Israeli bully it helped
to create and arm, it suddenly becomes haunted by the memory of
the Holocaust-a memory made vividly unforgettable by the unrelenting
Jewish propaganda machine. Any attempt to challenge the madness
is readily categorized under notoriously unforgiving accusations
and labels of 'anti-semitism'. <BR>
But two wrongs can never make a right. Marginalizing the suffering
of the Palestinian people by invoking the numerical proportionality
with the Holocaust is a futile exercise in the quantification
of pain. All infliction of suffering is equally unjustifiable,
regardless of how many people you have to kill. The Jewish people
will simply lose the essential moral grounds to their claim that
they have been wronged by the world when they-the supposed victims-are
seen to dispossess, persecute and dehumanize an entire people.<BR>
The historic facts are well documented. In 1947, the Palestinian
Arab population of Palestine owned 93% of the country, with the
Jewish community owning only 7%. On 29 November 1947, the United
Nations adopted Resolution 181, partitioning Palestine into separate
Arab and Jewish States. Already the Resolution was an absurd application
of the principle of national self-determination: under the partition
plan, 86% of the land designated for the proposed Jewish State
was Palestinian-inhabited and -owned land, with its Jewish citizens
in a minority position. Contrary to some current defeatist views,
the Arab rejection of that grossly unfair partition plan-at that
time and under those circumstances and facts-was perfectly understandable,
and its aftermath was equally predictable. The resulting war led
to the displacement of nearly one million Palestinians and to
the Israeli conquest of a further 25% of the territory on top
of what had been reserved for the Jewish State under the partition
plan. The massacres of civilians and the orchestrated depopulation
and obliteration of entire villages during that period are now
recognized by prominent Israeli historians. <BR>
Moshe Dayan, the one-eyed military figure who led all of Israel's
wars, stated in his address to the Technion school, Haifa, in
1969 (as quoted in the Israeli daily, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969):
&quot;Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages.
You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do
not blame you because geography books no longer exist. Not only
do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either.
Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbbutz Gvat in the place
of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushu'a
in the place of Tal al-Shuman. There is not one single place built
in this country that did not have a former Arab population.&quot;
What Dayan failed to add, however, was that the survivors of these
villages still live in squalid refugee camps in the West Bank,
Gaza, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon until this very day. Those less
fortunate were brutally massacred-ironically, only three years
after the defeat of Nazi Germany and by those very people who
claimed they suffered the most from its evil.<BR>
Israeli historian, Aryeh Yitzhaki, is a lecturer at the Bar Ilan
University, Tel Aviv, in the Faculty of Eretz Yisrael Studies
and is also a senior lecturer in the field of military history
in the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) courses for officers. In the
1960s, he served as director of the IDF archives within the framework
of his IDF service in his capacity as historian. &quot;The time
has come&quot;, Yitzhaki states, &quot;for a generation has passed,
and it is now possible to face the ocean of lies in which we were
brought up. In almost every conquered village in the War of Independence,
acts were committed, which are defined as war crimes, such as
indiscriminate killings, massacres and rapes. I believe that such
things end by surfacing. The only question is how to face such
evidence.&quot; He continues, &quot;For many Israelis, it was
easier to find consolation in the lie that the Arabs left the
country under orders from their leaders. This is an absolute fabrication.
The fundamental cause of their flight was their fear from Israeli
retribution and this fear was not at all imaginary. From almost
each report in the IDF archives concerning the conquest of Arab
villages between May and July 1948-when clashes with Arab villagers
were the fiercest-a smell of massacre emanates. Sometimes the
report tells about blatant massacres which were committed after
the battle, sometimes the massacres are committed in the heat
of battle and while the villages are 'cleansed'. Some of my colleagues,
such as Me'ir Pa'il, don't consider such acts as massacres. In
my opinion, there is no other term for such acts than massacres.&quot;<BR>
Another Israeli historian, Uri Milstein, adds: &quot;If Yitzhaki
claims that almost in every village there were murders, then I
maintain that even before the establishment of the State, each
battle ended with a massacre. In all Israel's wars, massacres
were committed, but I have no doubt that the War of Independence
was the dirtiest of them all.&quot; In 1967, and contrary to the
widespread Israeli lie, it was Israel who invaded and occupied
the rest of Palestine, the Golan heights and the Sinai desert,
under the pretext of an imminent Arab attack. A further wave of
more than half a million refugees fled their homes in fear of
repetition of the carnage that accompanied the 1948 war. Today
there are 4.7 million Palestinians in the world, out of whom 3.4
million are registered with UNRWA as refugees. So, the facts of
this apparently perplexing conflict are in fact uniquely simple.
Yet, our greatest disability in our interaction with the world
has always been our disastrous failure to express ourselves. Every
worthy opportunity we ever had to address the world media and
counter the fragile Zionist myths with reason and facts had been
hijacked by the inarticulate Arafat and his entourage. Through
decades of unforgivable blunders and excessive ineptitude, the
Arafat leadership has bordered on treason by aborting every conceivable
outlet to tell our story. For there has never been in history
such a straightforward case of dispossession and displacement
of a people from their land by a completely alien population.
<BR>
Although Jewish immigration to Palestine started at the beginning
of this century, until 1948 the Jewish population of Palestine
did not exceed 400,000. Between 1948 and 1969 alone, nearly 1.5
million Jews immigrated to Israel. Another 1.3 million immigrants
followed, nearly one million of which came to Israel only since
1990. These people came from all over the world. None of them
have ever set foot in Palestine before and they have come to take
a land that was not theirs-after the cruel and barbaric expulsion
of its original rightful owners. <BR>
We should never forget this basic fact. This is the principal
foundation of our grievances as Palestinians. Any other attempt
to deviate from this historical truth is yet a further distraction
from the origin of our case. In a message to what he called &quot;the
Jewish Communities of the Diaspora&quot; on the Occasion of Israel's
50th anniversary, Benyamin Netanyahu stated: &quot;I am certain
that a majority of the Jewish people will be living in Israel
by the time we celebrate the State's 60th anniversary.&quot; Of
course, no mention was even made of how Israel plans to physically
absorb such a number without expanding in all directions-let alone
displacing the current Palestinian population in the West Bank.<BR>
But this is not the only problem with Jewish immigration to Israel.
The notion that Jews from different countries have a superior
right to live in Palestine than that of the native Palestinians
lies at the heart of the morally indefensible teachings of Zionism.
The Israeli Law of Return of 1950 gives any Jew-defined as &quot;a
person who was born of a Jewish mother&quot;-the automatic right
to Israeli citizenship and the inalienable right to live in Israel.
The imbedded racism in this Zionist scheme speaks for itself.
The consequences of this unending influx of immigrants to Israel
are rapidly becoming visible. More and more Palestinians will
have to lose more of their homes and their land, and more Jewish
settlements will continue to be built in their place. With the
percentage of territory claimed by the Palestinian Authority shrinking
at each new procrastinated negotiations session, it will not be
very long before there will remain nothing to negotiate about.
Houses are demolished and land is confiscated every day. <BR>
The conclusion of this explosive situation is too obvious: Israel
would eventually need to take further bites off its neighbours
to accommodate its expanding population. In the midst of all this
madness, we must never relent in clearing the thick mist. Our
case is far too simple to become confined to a stalled dispute
about fractions of meaningless Israeli redeployments. We have
to continue to call things by their names. We have to expose the
vicious and bloody massacres and war crimes through which Israel
was created. We have to fearlessly articulate to the world all
the insane teachings of Zionism. We have to make it known that
for every Russian or any other Jew immigrating to Israel, there
is another Palestinian family being made homeless. Indeed, for
there ever to be a peaceful and just co-existence, we need to
regain our own conviction in the proverbial justice of our cause
and unveil the fundamental illegitimacy of Israel's occupation
and theft of our land-for that is what it really is: a primitive
act of theft. We have to get back to the roots of the Palestinian
tragedy. And we have to tell our story. All other venues of hope,
whether they come from the impotent Arab States or the pathetic
Palestinian leadership, seem to have been lost.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Autonomy Plan: Optimism Versus Pessimism:<BR>
Questions To Be Answered</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Dr. Jamal Shurdom*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>As a first step towards the road to peace, on 13 September
1993, the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a 'Declaration
of Principles' with Israel. The Declaration includes self-rule
for the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.
After three years of a &quot;test period&quot;, meetings would
be held to discuss autonomy for the remainder of the West Bank.
Finally, after the initial test period, the final status of the
West Bank and the city of Jerusalem would be determined. Israel
insisted that any demand could be brought to the table, presumably
including Statehood.</P>

<P>Would this treaty help bind Arabs and Israelis to live together
in peace and harmony? What can we expect to see at the end of
the road to peace? What are the obstacles? And, what kind of peace
is this? The issue of Palestinian autonomy is in its last phase
of implementation. This process has been carried out with high
risk of security and without any serious studies of its feasibility,
ramifications and applicability to other concerned Arabs (Jordanians,
Syrians, Lebanese, etc.). How do these parties view the treaty
in terms of their own national security, economic interests and
more importantly the future political map perceptions?</P>

<P>Logically, a successful autonomy plan should be based on the
common grounds of objectivity and compromise. The Treaty seems
to be more acceptable to the Israelis than by the Palestinians.
Palestinian critics argue that the treaty provides less than the
Palestinians own definition of minimum rights. It provides much
less than the minimum of Palestinian rights for which they fought
for over four decades past. Critics are concerned with the size,
political integrity and independence of the Palestinian identity.
Dr. Edward Sa'id, a distinguished Palestinian scholar, described
the Treaty by saying that it &quot;leaves Palestinians very much
the subordinates, with Israel still in charge of East Jerusalem,
settlements, sovereignty and the economy.&quot;</P>

<P>For the Israelis, it is too good to be true. This brought some
visible doubts concerning the PLO leader's (Arafat's) intentions,
both by Palestinians and Israelis alike. However, the scary part
of the future of the agreement is the election of the new Israeli
Prime Minister, Likud Party hardliner leader, Benyamin Netanyahu.
Netanyahu opposed the Treaty by saying, &quot;the greatest lie
of them all is that this dangerous agreement will bring peace,
it will not bring peace, it will bring more terror. It is laying
the groundwork for the next war.&quot; Another Likud Party leader,
Yitzhak Shamir, attacked the agreement saying, &quot;Israel is
in mortal peril. Nothing could be more dangerous for Israel's
future than an accord with the PLO.&quot;</P>

<P>During my recent visit to a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan,
one Palestinian hardliner went too far, angrily attacking Arafat
personally by describing him to me as &quot;... a professional
Israeli undercover agent, who was planted a long time ago by the
Israelis: How else do you explain the reason behind the secret
of his physical survival? Today, Arafat is protected by the Israeli
intelligence in fear of his own people. Why were all the top leaders
of the Palestinian revolution assassinated by the Israelis, except
Arafat? Look where he led our people and look at his tactics to
gradually drag Palestinians, step by step, into the mores of the
Israelis strategy of autonomy. Arafat ended the 'intifadah' (riot).
Today, and for the first time, Palestinians are killing Palestinians
and Palestinians are providing and protecting Israeli security
and share intelligence information against their own brothers.
And, on the top of all this, the hero of the Palestinian Revolution
is protected by the Israeli Mossad (the Intelligence Service).
Where are the other Palestinian Revolutionary leaders, such as
Dr. Habash, Hawatmeh, etc. All these things together make me wonder
who is Arafat?&quot;</P>

<P>However, Arafat, by signing this historical peace treaty with
Israel, raised very natural but dangerous questions. Is Arafat
a talented strategist who accepted a &quot;piece of the loaf&quot;
deal-a strategy that leads, at the very least at the end stage,
to achieve the Palestinian people's minimum national aspirations
of an independent Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza
with the City of East Jerusalem as its capital? Or is he a professional
Israeli intelligence agent, assigned by the Israelis to play his
different roles in order to drag the Palestinian people into an
Israeli-designed autonomy plan? Is Arafat a real, honest, and
distinctive brave peacemaker for Palestinians and Israelis? Is
he a nationalist Palestinian with a long-term vision: &quot;To
liberate all Palestine stage by stage?&quot;</P>

<P>In the aftermath of signing such a mysterious peace treaty,
one Palestinian leader told me that &quot;there are personal questions
about Arafat's background that should be made clear to the Palestinians,
such as who is the real Yasser Arafat? What is his childhood and
what elementary schools did he go to? Where was he really born?
What is the name of the street, town, village or city he grew
up in? What is the name of the street where his parents lived?
Where did his parents live, prior to Kuwait and of being a civil
engineer in Kuwait? Who were his close friends during his early
years of schooling? These wondering questions seem to be unanswered
by a number of Palestinian critics that I have interviewed. They
say, 'the man is too mysterious in his background to be a Palestinian'.&quot;</P>

<P>Additional questions were raised: Could this &quot;treaty&quot;
hopefully lead to a peaceful co-existence? Could it be a disastrous
tragedy, leading to the dilution of Palestinian rights, which
are recognized worldwide by multitudes of human rights organizations?
In the long run, could this treaty lead to infinitesimal negative
backfire side effects that endanger the future existence of the
Jewish State? Today: Is this treaty acceptable to the majority
of Palestinians, or do they consider it as if they were seduced
by the idea of autonomy set forth by Zionist strategists? Is it
a justifiable solution where it provides justice for both sides,
or is it a one-sided treaty where the Israelis harvest old-time
designed interests? Why did the PLO reject a better conditioned
autonomy plan in the Camp David Accords of 1979 to come all of
a sudden to accept much less conditions...?</P>

<P><B>What does the autonomy Mean?</B><BR>
The word &quot;autonomy&quot; is derived from the Latin term &quot;autonom&quot;,
which means local independent control of city councils and county
commissions in the case of nations. It could mean almost total
independence with total authority to make decisions all the way
to partial control over councils in the country. To tackle the
common perception of autonomy, it entails control over basic needs
like garbage collection, water/waste control, lightly armed police
force, and legal jurisdiction in all matters except national security.
The remaining aspects, namely trade and foreign policy, are left
to the controlling nation. Palestinian critics say the Israeli
view of autonomy means autonomy without eventual independence.
It means no national flag or recognition of a Palestinian State,
no implementation of international laws pertaining to nation-to-nation
relations. Israel as the &quot;mother country&quot; may withdraw
or change any laws governing this autonomy at any time, depending
on the alleged national security concerns, Israel's commitment
to keep the Palestinian population, a minority within the land
it controls. This type of autonomy will lead to the &quot;melting&quot;
of Palestinian identity into the large Israeli &quot;pot&quot;
and once and for all put an end to Palestinian culture and recognition.
A senior Israeli official who headed the Commission on Autonomy
stated once, &quot;Under the guise of autonomy, we can once and
for all wipe out the Palestinian question in a smooth way away
from the eyes of the international community.&quot;</P>

<P>Within the Israeli perception on the autonomy lies the concept
of &quot;local control&quot;, namely school boards, city or county
governments that control health and legal services, and national
infrastructure building projects. Most of these are already in
place commonly throughout the occupied West Bank, except for Israel's
daily &quot;disruptions and harassments&quot;.</P>

<P>It is to be expected that autonomy for Palestinians will lead
to the so-called solving of the Question of Palestine, thus, the
occupation receives a permanent rubber stamp from the world community.
Autonomy will not include the Palestinians right to be left alone
to determine their own destiny. It will remove the right of the
people to import and export freely, travel on their roads unharassed,
having due process of the law fairly and national relations with
other countries and, most importantly, to return back home from
the Palestinian diaspora. It is extremely important for the Palestinians
to be cautious and inferential that the autonomy plan is not a
mordant morass and fraudulent trap designed to entrap them and
make them fall into the trap of autonomy and fulfill the final
section of the century-old Zionist plot: to effectively and firmly
control Palestine. Many Palestinians believe that autonomy will
lead to independence. Stage by stage, self-rule will become self-determination.
History is not on the side of the Palestinians on this issue.
The Israeli version of autonomy, as it stands now, considers autonomy
as the one and only final step. Palestinians have to assure self-determination
as a cornerstone to a genuine peace. The occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip should be Palestine, with Jerusalem as its capital.
Anything less would be a sellout and a disaster for Palestinian
political identity. In addition, it would forever bury the question
of Palestine. Is the autonomy a fancy name for what is basically
an Israeli colony? What kind of gulf exists between Israeli and
Palestinian perceptions of what autonomy would entail?</P>

<P>To arrive at a truly objective and close understanding of autonomy,
we should ask ourselves as peace-loving people the reasons behind
the continuous Israeli insistence that autonomy is the solution.
Is it the solution? Israel has planned on autonomy since 1967,
and during the &quot;current peace negotiations has sought out
Palestinian collaborators to implement it&quot;, one Palestinian
refugee told me. In a quick look at the terms of the treaty, the
following Israeli advantageous points over the Palestinians are
visibly seen to express the reason behind Israel's support of
such a treaty:</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">1.</FONT></B> The Palestinian National
Authority's limited control over less than 9% of the West Bank.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">2.</FONT></B> Over 150 Israeli settlements
within the occupied Palestinian territories (and so-called Israel
&quot;State Lands&quot;) that will remain under absolute Israeli
control, as well as East Jerusalem.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">3.</FONT></B> The Gaza agreement,
which has left Israel in direct control of 40% of the Gaza Strip;
the West Bank redeployment gives Palestinians nothing that Israelis
aren't glad to be rid of.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">4.</FONT></B> &quot;Israel risks little
of its fundamental national interests, while the Palestinians
put nearly everything on the table.&quot;</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">5.</FONT></B> Israel's principal concession
is the redeployment of Israeli military forces from Palestinian
towns and villages in the West Bank-and even that is tentative.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">6.</FONT></B> Anytime Israel decides
the Palestinian protests are getting out of hand, the whole process
will be in jeopardy.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">7.</FONT></B> The Palestinians longstanding
claim that Israel's military presence in the Palestinian occupied
territories violates international law will be weakened if not
destroyed.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">8.</FONT></B> The Palestinians right
of armed struggle is effectively bargained away. The &quot;real&quot;
PLO fighters are not allowed to return except those who were selectively
and purposely trained in Jordan for the police security force.
Only for Pro-Arafat force.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">9.</FONT></B> Israel gains de facto
diplomatic recognition by the Palestinians without extending reciprocity.
Palestinians will remain Stateless and separated into &quot;seven
enclaves that are largely isolated from each other and closely
controlled by Israel.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">10.</FONT></B> The 150 Israeli settlements
in the occupied territories attain a new luster of permanence
and legitimacy.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">11.</FONT></B> The agreement does
not allow Palestinians and their popular nationalist leaders in
the diaspora to have the right to return home to Palestine.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">12.</FONT></B> The Palestinian refugee
problem remains unsolved.</P>

<P>From a Palestinian perspective, the following questions should
clearly be answered: Where do the concepts of political rights
and self-determination fall within the framework of autonomy?
Is autonomy a stepping stone for an independent Palestinian entity
able to make free decisions of eventual Statehood for itself on
the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital? What guarantees
are given by Israel to implement all parts of the treaty, including
the city of Jerusalem? Could the autonomy plan be a secret Zionist-designed
conspiracy leading eventually to the revival of an old Israel
planned strategy of &quot;Jordan is Palestine&quot;-the establishment
of a Palestinian State in Jordan under the mask of confederation
or federation with Jordan? The Jordanian national security strategists
are urged to be cautious and to be where this treaty may lead
to in the long run. A Jordanian distinguished scholar told me
that the treaty &quot;is a melting pot for the future Jordanian
political identity.&quot; It is a serious matter for Jordanians
to widely open their eyes and act accordingly.</P>

<H3><CENTER>In Response to Defeatist Thought:<BR>
Steadfastness as a Working Rational Strategy</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Dr. Ibrahim Alloush*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Many of us have come to hold that the idea of the liberation
of Palestine or steadfastness (somoud) in the face of Zionism
are excess political luggage from the bygone 1950s and 1960s.
Many of us now believe that these are but slogans, perhaps poetry,
that do not tackle effectively the hard questions posed upon us
by political reality. But a careful analysis of the concept of
steadfastness may otherwise prove that it can still be an effective
and indispensable strategy of achieving our political goals in
the coming century. This conclusion emanates from a cold, hard
objective look at the role of steadfastness in winning wars.<BR>
In the Napoleonic wars and for several decades afterwards, it
was conventional military wisdom that you should bombard enemy
lines heavily with cannon balls then proceed in waves to finish
off the remaining pockets of enemy resistance with rifles and
bayonets.<BR>
Then with the advent of the assembly line in industry and the
invention of machine guns that could fire several rounds of bullets
in a single hail, these little pockets of enemy resistance that
survived the aftermath of heavy bombardment could mow down wave
after wave of advancing troops. This meant that advantage was
found in defense not offense. Thus the First World War was a war
of stalemates and savage carnage caused by the machine guns of
defenders who frequently went on the offensive after thinking
that they had taught the enemy a lesson only to learn a similar
lesson.<BR>
As civilian industry became more capital-intensive, however, the
Germans handled this problem in the Second World War with the
massive introduction of the tank into the battlefield, and by
developing the concept of Blitzkrieg. Basically, massive bombardment
a la the Napoleonic wars is concentrated only on a small section
of the well-fortified defense line like the famous line of Magineaux,
then tanks would rush in (Blitzkrieg) through that particular
section with troops walking safely behind these moving steel fortifications,
away from machine-gun fire. After achieving that penetration,
the other defending troops on other parts of the defense line
would get surrounded, after which they would try to negotiate
a surrender treaty with the advancing enemy, especially after
seeing how their defense lines and plans had collapsed, thus concluding
that it's better to preserve their lives by fleeing or giving
up.<BR>
The Soviets were the first to deflate the effectiveness of the
German Blitzkrieg as a strategic weapon in the Second World War.
After the initial penetration unto Soviet lines is made, and it
always does when you concentrate such large forces on only a tiny
section of the long defense line, the Soviet commanders would
order every Red Army group on the other parts of the defense line,
surrounded or not, intact or refurbished with supplies or not,
to hold down their positions STEADFASTLY to the last fighter,
regardless of what is happening elsewhere. No surrender. No treaty.
No retreat under any circumstances. Just fight on behind your
line so it may become the base for a counter-offensive in the
future or at least to prevent further advancement by the Germans
from opening up loopholes elsewhere. The legendary steadfastness
of Stalingrad was the product of this rational choice.<BR>
This was NOT conventional military wisdom at the time though.
To keep on fighting after the collapse of your overall defense
line and plan due to a Blitzkrieg or an encirclement was deemed
by contemporary military strategists as a form of deadly stubborn
vanity, emotional at best. But the Soviets called it STEADFASTNESS.
And this is not poetry or sloganeering, even though it surely
sounds pretty to me. Steadfastness WORKED as an effective tangible
strategic defense against Blitzkriegs. Of course, the Soviets
also developed the RPG, the light anti-tank rocket launcher which
could be carried and launched by a single foot soldier off the
shoulder.<BR>
In fact, steadfastness worked so well that the Germans adopted
it in the face of advancing American and Soviet troops later on.
And I will not elaborate here on how German steadfastness was
eventually overcome and the dear price that was exacted of the
allies in the process. Because in the end, where there's a will,
there's a way.<BR>
What matters for us here and now is to know that until today,
the Blitzkrieg is still the primary &quot;Israeli&quot; method
of offense, except that planes are used in conjunction with cannons
of the modern variety in the preliminaries. I believe that the
&quot;Israeli&quot; army is capable of reaching as far as Morocco
in a Blitzkrieg under aerial cover, but that won't mean political
or military defeat for us unless we elect to give up the rational
choice of steadfastness as happened in many previous wars with
&quot;Israel&quot;. Note please that the political applications
for this line of thinking are endless.<BR>
Note also that the RPG is so simple to make that the PLO used
to manufacture the launcher itself back in the 1970s (but not
the rocket head). SAM 7s and Stinger missiles are the aerial equivalent
of RPGs today. Note as well that Beirut in the summer of 1982
was a prime example of steadfastness THAT WORKS. And that is not
poetry or sloganeering even though it still looks pretty to me
even after all these years of having seen it work with my own
Palestinian eyes.</P>

Hollywood Must Be More Responsible</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ray Hanania*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Hollywood has a responsibility to be responsible.<BR>
The films that are produced there are more than just &quot;entertainment.&quot;
Oftentimes, they are the main source of information that many
people receive on controversial subjects. And, Hollywood films
are a continuing source for negative stereotyping which becomes
a foundation for bigotry.<BR>
The release of the movie The Siege will only feed into a cauldron
of problems that continue to stew unattended. The Siege, which
stars Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, is about incidents of
terrorism and rumors of more to come in New York City. The Police,
Army and FBI react by rounding up all the city's Arabs and Muslims
into armed concentration camps. It is a terrifying thought that
has happened in our society before, but under more extreme circumstances.<BR>
Arab Americans, in particular, are victimized by this. It is not
the result of a conspiracy, but the absence of responsibility
that results in Arab Americans being characterized in nearly every
movie with Middle East themes to be pegged as terrorists or the
movie's villains.<BR>
These negative perceptions serve as the starting point for a wide
array of events that include incidents of racism and bigotry,
hate crimes against Arabs, discrimination not only in society
but in the work place and on a personal level, the denial of basic
rights to avenues of free speech in local newspapers, and the
exclusion of Arab Americans from participation in government and
private area activities.<BR>
Arab Americans are being victimized by a pernicious, but naturally
developing chain of events that has their Hollywood screen images
conveyed to everyday and real life events. A grocery store owner
accused of abusing customers or providing sub-standard food products
is described as &quot;an Arab grocery store owner.&quot; A gas
station owner who short changes his customers is an &quot;Arab
gas station owner.&quot; The man who is involved in criminal activity
from gambling to more serious crimes including theft and murder,
is described as &quot;an Arab American suspect.&quot;<BR>
The problem Arab Americans face is not simply one of trying to
sway public opinion on issues involving the Middle East policy,
or whether or not you do or don't support Israel. The problem
is much deeper, and it is being fed by a constant assault from
Hollywood.<BR>
Arab Americans are an easy target for many reasons. And we are
becoming easy scapegoats who can't seem to defend themselves or
generate public support in our defense. Arabs are viewed not a
multi-cultural, multi-religious people, but as a single religious
entity with one culture defined by Webster's Dictionary (vagabonds).
We're perceived as all being Muslim, and therefore unChristian.
We're dark skinned, also, and viewed by White racists as being
&quot;Black.&quot; We don't speak a phonetically discernable language
compatible with English (such as Spanish), and instead speech
a heavy guttural language that is not taught in most schools.
We wear different clothes. And, because the Islamic religion calls
for women to cover themselves, we are viewed contemptuously by
many woman's rights and civil rights groups.<BR>
Muslims are misunderstood and mis-portrayed. The word &quot;Allah&quot;
is interpreted as a &quot;different&quot; God than the God of
Christians and Jews, when in fact is just another word for the
same God, such as &quot;Yahweh&quot; and &quot;Jehovah.&quot;
In fact, all Arabs, be they Christian or Muslim, use the term
Allah to refer to God. <BR>
Many people argue Hollywood has no impact on our society. But
I contend the impact is greater than we are willing to recognize.
More frightening is the pattern of Hollywood films to portray
the future, not in a mystical sense, but as a reflection of mankind's
thought process. It is a reflection of what people believe, and
it feeds into itself.<BR>
What is now Airport profiling on the basis of ethnic patterns
(such as being Middle Eastern, having black hair and olive skin
color) may soon become a much more intrusive policy of detention,
strip searching and harassment.<BR>
We are all human. When we leave the movie theater, we don't challenge
the perceptions that are thrown to us as a captive and willing
audience that walked in voluntarily. We leave with those perceptions.
Over the years, those perceptions have molded not only international
policies toward the Arab World, but they continue to lay the foundation
for choices that we make in society. <BR>
The real fear is that a people who are abused, abandoned, and
ridiculed constantly, will rise up and turn to the only alternative
allowed to them, violence. That is how terrorism starts. It isn't
always the pre-conceived weapon of extremist groups bent on inflicting
wanton harm. <BR>
Oftentimes, it is the natural result of frustration that stem
from inherent policies of exclusion, intimidation, incitement
and discrimination. I cannot say that violence will accompany
the release of the movie The Siege. But I would not be surprised
if Arab Americans become fed up and take actions that otherwise
could have been avoided had they been allowed a real alternative
way to confront these concerns.</P>

U.S. Policy in Iraq: Toward Disarmament or Starvation?</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ghada Khouri*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Until recently, American policy toward Iraq had elicited little
public criticism within U.S. domestic circles. But all this changed
with the highly-publicized resignation of former United Nations
weapons inspector Scott Ritter last August. <BR>
Ritter quickly took to the media to blast U.S. interference with
surprise inspections by UNSCOM, the UN Special Commission in charge
of dismantling Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical arsenal.
In his resignation letter, subsequently released to the press,
Ritter described the U.S. stance as &quot;a surrender to the Iraqi
leadership that has succeeded in thwarting the will of the United
Nations.&quot;<BR>
American officials counter-attacked by criticizing Ritter for
sharing information he gathered in his capacity as chief of UNSCOM's
concealment investigations unit. Despite the Government's response,
it became clear that U.S. rhetoric vowing a swift response to
Iraqi non-cooperation masked private diplomatic efforts to avert
any unilateral action which lacked the full backing of the UN
Security Council. <BR>
Ritter's affirmation that the United States had influenced UNSCOM's
work highlighted the skewed relationship between the U.S. Government
and a supposedly unbiased international commission of technical
experts. It also validated Iraqi complaints about the politicization
of the sanctions and disarmament regimes. Furthermore, the events
leading up to Ritter's withdrawal from UNSCOM provided a clear
indication of a change in U.S. policy from a focus on disarmament
to an indefinite prolongation of sanctions. <BR>
This policy shift indicates the United States' refusal to engage
in a mouse-and-cat puppet show where Saddam Hussein pulls the
strings at will. Rather than admit to its failure in undermining
Saddam's regime, the United States has opted to demonstrate its
tenacity by opposing any efforts to relax sanctions, which have
wreaked havoc on Iraq's civilian population. <BR>
While the American media devoted extensive coverage to Ritter's
scathing criticism of the Clinton administration for its efforts
to avoid confrontation with Iraq, another resignation went largely
unnoticed-that of Denis Halliday, who abandoned a 34-year career
in the United Nations for entirely different reasons.<BR>
Halliday also acted in protest over U.S. policy, not for interfering
with the disarmament effort, but for pushing for the unlimited
continuation of economic sanctions. &quot;UNICEF confirms that
5,000 to 6,000 Iraqi children are dying unnecessarily every month
due to the impact of the sanctions, and that figure is probably
modest&quot;, Halliday, who headed the UN humanitarian mission
in Iraq, told a congressional briefing on 6 October.<BR>
He decried the multi-faceted impact of eight years of sanctions
on Iraq's 23 million inhabitants, pointing to alarming death rates,
disease, poverty and malnutrition among the most vulnerable segments
of the population. The sanctions have also had adverse social,
psychological and cultural consequences by giving rise to homelessness,
prostitution, illiteracy and unemployment. <BR>
According to Halliday, 20% to 30% of Iraqi students drop out of
school, a figure paralleled with a dramatic increase in crime,
begging and child labour. Fewer young adults wed because of lack
of resources, while Iraqi professionals are reduced to menial
jobs as they struggle to make ends meet. <BR>
The severe decline in the quality of life and the collapse of
Muslim family values &quot;could breed fanaticism and deep-seated
resentment&quot; toward the West for generations to come, Halliday
warned. The anger on the Iraqi street is compounded by the virtual
isolation of Iraqi intellectuals, who are cut off from the rest
of the world, he added.<BR>
Despite overwhelming evidence that the embargo has caused devastation
among the Iraqi population, the U.S. Government continues to advocate
sanctions as a means of weakening the central regime. Yet, critics
like Halliday argue that people faced with &quot;sheer survival&quot;
have no inclination to &quot;think about governance issues&quot;
or the need for &quot;a more participatory government.&quot;<BR>
The dual message sent by Ritter and Halliday was recently embodied
in a congressional initiative calling for the Clinton administration
to delink economic and military sanctions in order to alleviate
the suffering of the Iraqi people while tightening the knot on
their ruler. Forty-four members of the U.S. House of Representatives
and two Senators have sent letters to President Clinton calling
for measures to improve and speed up the flow of humanitarian
goods into Iraq. <BR>
These few, yet vocal, domestic critics of U.S. policy emphasize
the indivisibility of human rights, arguing that even if Saddam
Hussein seems to care less about the well-being of his own people,
his actions should not serve as a yardstick for acceptable behaviour
among civilized nations. Neither Halliday nor the members of Congress
who have endorsed this initiative have anything good to say about
the former U.S. ally turned &quot;Butcher of Baghdad&quot;. But
they say plenty about the United States' complicity in the slow
death of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who have
no influence on their Government's actions. <BR>
The opposed, albeit asymmetrical, trends in U.S. policy-making
circles are mirrored within the UN system itself. While Ritter's
resignation was followed by a Security Council vote to suspend
the monthly review of sanctions until Iraq resumes cooperation
with UNSCOM, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan is now proposing
a comprehensive review which could lead to a specific timetable
for lifting the sanctions. The outcome of Annan's intervention
could lead to the collapse of a faltering U.S. policy toward Iraq.</P>

<H3><CENTER>India and Pakistan: International Pressure, Internal
Crises</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Aisha Khan*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>International pressure and domestic compulsions have forced
India and Pakistan to the negotiating table once more, reviving
the dialogue process that stalled over a year ago. Ever since
India and Pakistan went nuclear, international (mainly the United
States) pressure on the two countries to mend fences to prevent
any nuclear flashpoint has increased. At the same time, both countries
have not yet signed the CTBT-a step that Pakistan has linked to
the resolution of contentious issues with India, namely Kashmir,
as well as the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.
and other countries. India, on the other hand, has also raised
the issue that many features of the CTBT, especially the Entry
into Force clause (Article 14) and the provisions on the Fissile
Material Cut-off Treaty, are discriminatory and loaded against
late entries in the Nuclear Club. On the domestic front, both
the Nawaz Sharif and Atal Behari Vajpayee governments are floundering
in economic crises-rising prices, etc.-aggravated by the sanctions
imposed by the international community. Simultaneously, razor-sharp
criticism has been on the rise from increasingly vocal opposition
groups. The diplomatic talks between the two countries and the
prospect of some movement forward should ease some of this pressure.
At the same time, it is unlikely that the two countries will be
able to make much progress on the key issue of Kashmir. The same
domestic pressure forcing them to make some headway on the international
front, ironically, will prevent them from reaching an agreement
in the domestic arena, precisely because any agreement would require
considerable compromise from both the parties, and compromise
would evoke much criticism at home. Right now, it is important
for the two countries to show some &quot;progress&quot; to ease
the pressure emanating from the U.S. and at the same time to make
a case for lifting the sanctions and to create an atmosphere conducive
to the signing of the CTBT. On the other hand, the issue of Kashmir
will again be postponed, this time probably to the next round
of talks, which are to be held in New Delhi. By the time this
article appears in print, preparations for the New Delhi round
would have begun. Right now, conflicting signals are emerging
from the first round, under way in Islamabad. The talks began
on 16 October on a bad note: Pakistan reacted badly to India's
intimation of military exercises. India, on the other hand, felt
that giving prior intimation of the exercises to be held in November
was part of the &quot;confidence-building measures&quot; agreed
on in 1994. Pakistan foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmad, however,
termed the timing as &quot;unfortunate&quot;. <BR>
Nevertheless, the first day of talks on &quot;Peace and Security&quot;
and &quot;Confidence-building Measures&quot; (CBMs) seemed to
go off well. Both sides suggested measures to lower tensions.
Extending present hotlines between Director Generals of military
operations to divisional and sector commanders, giving advance
notices of missile tests, exchange of officers between the respective
National Defence Colleges, etc. were some of the ideas presented.
Apart from all this, the suggestion of a &quot;No first-use pact&quot;
on nuclear weapons between the two countries was turned down by
Pakistan, saying it was &quot;outdated and irrelevant&quot;. Instead,
Islamabad suggested a more comprehensive &quot;non-aggression
treaty&quot;, which would include conventional arms, not just
nuclear weapons. India's offer, excluding whatever noble intentions
of peace there may be, seems to be part of an attempt to re-establish
its military superiority over Pakistan. <BR>
Prior to the nuclear test, India had a clearly defined superiority
over Pakistan in terms of manpower, armaments and conventional
stockpiles. This was obliterated the moment both became nuclear
powers. Now India's offer of a nuclear no first-use pact aims
to neutralize the effect that going nuclear has had on their military
equation with Pakistan. Excluding nuclear weapons from the picture,
India would once again have a decided upper hand in the strategic
equation. Pakistan, realizing the implication, wants no part of
such an agreement and is adamant that any such pact should include
conventional weapons as well. On the Kashmir issue, as expected,
not much headway has been made yet. Both countries stuck to their
irreconcilable positions with Pakistan saying, &quot;Kashmir is
part of the unfinished agenda of Partition&quot;, while India
saw it only as a question of Pakistan's illegal occupation of
territory and sponsoring of militancy in other parts of the State.
As always, the truth lies somewhere in between, but whether the
two can act on it will only be seen in the months to come, certainly
not in the first round.<BR>
While both the Prime Ministers expressed their willingness to
sign the CTBT at the UN General Assembly, back home they do not
have a very receptive audience for their respective points of
view. Both the countries are resuming the process of dialogue
at a time when their Governments are grappling with (not so successfully
though) domestic crises. <BR>
The Nawaz Sharif Government in Pakistan has tried to consolidate
its powers by bulldozing the so-called Shariat bill through Parliament.
Sharif thought this to be a political masterstroke, since it would
enable him to push through any number of measures by claiming
they are &quot;Islamic&quot;, but it seems the move has boomeranged
on him. There is widespread discontentment against his Government,
particularly the Shariat bill. While many say the Pakistani Constitution
already has provisions to govern according to the Shariah, others
clearly termed the move as an attempt to establish a semi-dictatorial
rule. That Sharif is floundering is apparent in the manner in
which he summarily dismissed the Pakistan Chief of Army Staff,
General Karamat, for making a speech vaguely critical of the governing
apparatus. <BR>
In India, the extreme Hindu right wing Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) leading the Government is showing its true colours-that
of a semi-fascist party that flourishes by fostering hatred for
the minority communities in India. Witness the manner in which
the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a close association of the BJP, reacted
to the rape of two Christian nuns in Madhya Pradesh, a predominantly
tribal underdeveloped State. One VHP leader praised the attacks
as &quot;an expression of patriotic fervour&quot; by the motivated
Indian youth. While the Government did condemn the rapes, it has
not taken any concrete action to punish the guilty, nor has it
condemned the statements of its sister organizations. In fact,
the leader of the RSS (the driving force behind the BJP) issued
a statement warning minorities not to protest or &quot;overreact&quot;
to such incidents while another VHP leader said this was the cue
for Christian missionaries to leave the country. <BR>
Hindu-Muslim riots also broke out in Bihar, a State where the
ruling BJP wanted to oust the non-BJP Government by declaring
Central rule. It was unable to do so as it could not persuade
the President that sufficient grounds existed for such a move.
Surprisingly, or not so surprisingly, the riots broke out soon
afterwards in a region of Bihar which is a stronghold of one of
the BJP's oldest allies, the Samata Party. Naturally the BJP was
trying to discredit the State Government by engineering such riots.
That innocent people die, or the atmosphere of distrust and tension
increase between the two communities is a fringe benefit in such
cold political calculations.<BR>
In fact, riots in India have always been a means of swinging the
political equations in a certain direction. Even so-called secular
parties bank on riots to consolidate their own vote caches. Mulayam
Singh Yadav, basically a Hindu-backward caste leader, consolidated
his hold on Muslim votes in the late 1980s and early 1990s by
continuously whipping up fear of the Hindu nationalist BJP among
Muslims. Though he is called &quot;Mulla Mulayam&quot; by Hindu
nationalists, many believe he engineers riots against Muslims
just to make sure they get the message of who to vote for.</P>

<P><B>Jewish History, Jewish Religion</B></P>

<H3><CENTER>The Weight of History</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Part 9</B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B>By Israel Shahak</B></CENTER></P>

<P>A great deal of nonsense has been written in the attempt to
provide a social or mystical interpretation of Jewry or Judaism
'as whole'. This cannot he done, for the social structure of the
Jewish people and the ideological structure of Judaism have changed
profoundly through the ages. Four major phases can be distinguished:</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">1-</FONT></B> The phase of the ancient
kingdoms of Israel and Judah, until destruction the first Temple
(5S7 BC) and the Babylonian exile. (Much of the Old Testament
is concerned with this period, although most major books of the
Old Testament including the Pentateuch as we know it, were actually
composed after that date.) Socially, these ancient Jewish kingdoms
were quite similar to the neighbouring kingdoms of Palestine and
Syria; and - as a careful reading of the Prophets reveals - the
similarity extended the religious cults practiced by the great
majority of the people. The ideas that were to become typical
of later Judaism-including in particular ethnic segregationism
and monotheistic exclusivism - were at this stage confined to
small circles of priests and prophets, whose social influence
depended on royal support .</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">2- </FONT></B>The phase of the dual
centres, Palestine and Mesopotamia, from the first 'Return from
Babylon' (537 BC) until about AD 500. It is characterised by the
existence of these two autonomous Jewish societies, both based
primarily on agriculture, on which the 'Jewish religion', as previously
elaborated in priestly and scribal circles, was imposed by the
force and authority of the Persian empire. The Old Testament Book
of Ezra contains an account of the activities of Ezra the priest,
'a ready scribe in the law of Moses', who was empowered by King
Artaxerxes I of Persia to 'set magistrates and judges' over the
Jews of Palestine, so that 'whosoever will not do the law of thy
God and the law of king, let judgement be executed speedily upon
him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation
of goods or to imprisonment' And in the Book of Nehemiah- cupbearer
to King Artaxerxes who was appointed Persian governor of Judea,
with even greater powers - we see to what extent foreign (nowadays
one would say 'imperialist' ) coercion was instrumental in imposing
the Jewish religion, <I>with lasting results</I>.</P>

<P>In both centres, Jewish autonomy persisted during most of this
period and deviations from religious orthodoxy were repressed.
Exceptions to this rule occurred when the religious aristocracy
itself got 'infected' with Hellenistic ideas (from 300 to 166
BC and again under Herod the Great and his successors, from 50
BC to AD 70), or when it was split in reaction to new developments
(for example, the division between the two great parties, the
Pharisees and the Sadduceans, which emerged in about 140 BC).
However, the moment any one party triumphed, it used the coercive
machinery of the Jewish autonomy (or, for a short period, independence)
to impose its own religious views on all the Jews in both centres.</P>

<P>During most of this time, especially after the collapse of
the Persian empire and until about AD 200, the Jews outside the
two centres were free from Jewish religious coercion. Among the
papyri preserved in Elephantine (in Upper Egypt) there is a letter
dating from 419 BC containing the text of an edict by King Darius
II of Persia which instructs the Jews of Egypt as to the details
of the observance of Passover. But the Hellenistic kingdoms, the
Roman Republic and early Roman Empire did not bother with such
things. The freedom that Hellenistic Jews enjoyed outside Palestine
allowed the creation of a Jewish literature written in Greek,
which was subsequently rejected <I>in toto</I> by Judaism and
whose remains were preserved by Christianity. The very rise of
Christianity was possible because of this relative freedom of
the Jewish communities <I><FONT COLOR="#000000">outside </FONT></I>the
two centres. The experience of the Apostle Paul is significant:
in Corinth, when the local Jewish community accused Paul of heresy,
the Roman governor Gallio dismissed the case at once, refusing
to be a 'judge of such matters'; but in Judea the governor Festus
felt obliged to take legal cognizance of a purely religious internal
Jewish dispute.</P>

<P>This tolerance came to an end in about AD 200, when the Jewish
religion, as meanwhile elaborated and evolved in Palestine, was
imposed by the Roman authorities upon all the Jews of the Empire.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">3-</FONT></B> The phase which we have
defined as <I>classical Judaism</I> and which will be discussed
below.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">4-</FONT></B> The modern phase charactcrised
by the breakdown of the totalitarian Jewish community and its
power, and by attempts to reimpose it, of which zionism is the
most important. This phase begins in Holland in the 1 7th century,
in France and Austria (excluding Hungary ) in the late 18th century,
in most other European countries in the middle of the 19th century,
and in some Islamic countries in the 20th century. (The Jews of
Yemen were still living in the medieval 'classical' phase in 1948).
Something concerning these developments will be said later on.</P>

<P>Between the second phase and the third, that of classical Judaism,
there is a gap of several centuries in which our present knowledge
of Jews and Jewish society is very slight, and the scant information
we do have is all derived from external (non-Jewish) sources.
In the countries of Latin Christendom we have absolutely no Jewish
literary records until the middle of the 10th century; internal
Jewish information, mostly from religious literature, becomes
more abundant only in the 11th and particularly the 12th century.
Before that, we are wholly dependent first on Roman and then on
Christian evidence. In the Islamic countries the information gap
is not quite so big; still, very little is known about Jewish
society before AD 800 and about the changes it must have undergone
during the three preceding centuries.</P>

<P><B><U>Major Features of Classical Judaism</U></B><BR>
Let us therefore ignore those 'dark ages' and for the sake of
convenience begin with the two centuries 1000-1200 for which abundant
information is available from both internal and external sources
on all the important Jewish centres, east and west. Classical
Judaism, which is clearly discernible in this period has undergone
very few changes since then and (in the guise of Orthodox Judaism)
is still a powerful force today.</P>

<P>How can that classical Judaism be characterised, and what are
the social differences distinguishing it from earlier phases of
Judaism? I believe that there are three such major features.</P>

<P><B><I>1 Classical Jewish society has no peasants</I></B>, and
in this it differs profoundly from earlier Jewish societies in
the two centres, Palestine and Mesopotamia. It is difficult for
us, in modern times, to understand what this means. We have to
make an effort to imagine what serfdom was like; the enormous
difference in literacy, let alone education, between village and
town throughout this period; the incomparably greater freedom
enjoyed by all the small minority who were not peasants-in order
to realise that during the whole of the classical period the Jews,
in spite of all the persecutions to which they were subjected,
formed an integral part of the privileged classes. Jewish historiography,
especially in English, is misleading on this point inasmuch as
it tends to focus on Jewish poverty and anti-Jewish discrimination.
Both were real enough at times; but the poorest Jewish craftsman,
pedlar, landlord's steward or petty cleric was immeasurably better
off than a serf. This was particularly true in those European
countries where serfdom persisted into the 19th century, whether
in a partial or extreme form: Prussia, Austria (including Hungary),
Poland and the Polish lands taken by Russia. And it is not without
significance that, prior to the beginning of the great Jewish
migration of modern times (around 1880), a large majority of all
Jews were living in those areas and that their most important
social function there was to mediate the oppression of the peasants
on behalf of the nobility and the Crown.</P>

<P>Everywhere, classical Judaism developed hatred and contempt
for agriculture as an occupation and for peasants as a class,
even more than for other Gentiles - a hatred of which I know no
parallel in other societies. This is immediately apparent to anyone
who is familiar with the Yiddish or Hebrew literature of the 19th
and 20th centuries.</P>

<P>.Most east-European Jewish socialists (that is. members of
exclusively or predominantly Jewish parties and factions) are
guilty of never pointing out this fact; indeed, many were themselves
tainted with a ferocious anti-peasant attitude inherited from
classical Judaism. Of course, zionist 'socialists' were the worst
in this respect, but others, such as the Bund, were not much better.
A typical example is their opposition to the formation of peasant
cooperatives promoted by the Catholic clergy on the ground that
this was 'an act of antisemitism'. This attitude is by no means
dead even now; it could be seen very clearly in the racist views
held by many Jewish 'dissidents' in the USSR regarding the Russian
people, and also in the lack of discussion of this background
by so many Jewish socialists, such as Isaac Deutscher. The whole
racist propaganda on the theme of the supposed superiority of
Jewish morality and intellect (in which many Jewish socialists
were prominent) is bound up with a lack of sensitivity for the
suffering of that major part of humanity who were especially oppressed
during the last thousand years - the peasants.</P>

<P><B><I>2 Classical Jewish society was particularly dependent
on kings or on nobles with royal powers</I></B>. In the next chapter
we discuss various Jewish laws directed against Gentiles, and
in particular laws which command Jews to revile Gentiles and refrain
from praising them or their customs. These laws allow one and
only one exception: a Gentile king, or a locally powerful magnate
(in Hebrew <I>paritz</I>, in Yiddish <I>pooretz</I>). A king is
praised and prayed for, and he is obeyed not only in most civil
matters but also in some religious ones. As we shall see Jewish
doctors, who are in general forbidden to save the lives of ordinary
Gentiles on the Sabbath, are commanded to do their utmost in healing
magnates and rulers; this partly explains why kings and noblemen,
popes and bishops often employed Jewish physicians. But not only
physicians. Jewish tax and customs collectors or (in eastern Europe)
bailiffs of manors could be depended upon to do their utmost for
the king or baron, in a way that a Christian could not always
be.</P>

<P>The legal status of a Jewish community in the period of classical
Judaism was normally based on a 'privilege' - a charter granted
by a king or prince (or, in Poland after the 1 6th century, by
a powerful nobleman) to the Jewish community and conferring on
it the rights of autonomy - that is, investing the rabbis with
the power to dictate to the other Jews. An important part of such
privileges, going as far back as the late Roman Empire, is the
creation of a Jewish clerical estate which exactly like the Christian
clergy in medieval times, is exempt from paying taxes to the sovereign
and is allowed to impose taxes on the people under its control-
the Jews - for its own benefit. It is interesting to note that
this deal between the late Roman Empire and the rabbis antedates
by at least one hundred years the very similar privileges granted
by Constantine the Great and his successors to the Christian clergy.</P>

<P>From about AD 200 until the early 5th century, the legal position
of Jewry in the Roman Empire was as follows. A hereditary Jewish
Patriarch (residing in Tiberias in Palestine) was recognised both
as a high dignitary in the official hierarchy of the Empire and
as supreme chief of all the Jews in the Empire. As a Roman official,
the Patriarch was <I>vir illustris</I>, of the same high official
class which included the consuls, the top military commanders
of the Empire and the chief ministers around the throne (the Sacred
Consistory), and was out-ranked only by the imperial family. In
fact, the Illustrious Patriarch (as he is invariably styled in
imperial decrees) out-ranked the provincial governor of Palestine.
Emperor Theodosius 1, the Great, a pious and orthodox Christian,
executed his governor of Palestine for insulting the Patriarch.</P>

<P>My name is Ze'ev. I am an Israeli soldier stationed in Gaza.
Yesterday's aberrations have become today's norm and today's aberration
will be authorized as standard practice tomorrow.<BR>
What is alarming is the tempo at which aberrations have become
norms. A soldier like me needs to have a strong stomach and a
mechanism of repression. Press photographers no longer rush off
to Gaza. The reason is not because of difficulties posed by areas
closed to journalists, harassment from locals, or the fact that
the journalist has made a bundle already, selling his photographs
to leading international newspapers. There simply is no longer
a great demand for his photographs. Yesterday's journalistic coup
has become banal. The world has grown accustomed to photos of
atrocities. A picture of an Israeli soldier kicking an old Arab
woman is no longer news. It's been seen already.<BR>
It has not been easy to have no conscience. The other day children
pelted my regiment with stones. My comrades and I chased the boys
up into their village. But the kids were nimble and of course
managed to escape. Only one child, about 10 years old was left
behind. <BR>
We caught him and one of my colleagues shouted at the boy, &quot;Tell
us who the other stone-throwers were!&quot;<BR>
The boy remained silent so we started to beat him, or as one of
my fellow soldiers said, &quot;to mash his head in.&quot;<BR>
A strange howl, eerie, came from the boy's mouth. But he didn't
breathe a word. Gaza is hot in the summer, terribly hot. Beating
a child is not an easy job and as each soldier took a turn at
the boy, we began to sweat. Suddenly, the boy's mother appeared
and with a wail that would rend your heart, fell upon us, trying
to save her son as a lioness would do if her cub were in danger.
We beat her too.<BR>
I could no longer take part in this savage behaviour. I backed
away as my comrades continued to beat the boy. It was only later,
when he was flat on the ground, his body black and blue and bleeding,
or as another one of my fellow soldiers put it, &quot;looking
like a steak&quot; did it dawn on us that the child was deaf,
dumb and mentally retarded.<BR>
None of my friends were bothered by the silent form. Our platoon
commander yelled at us, &quot;Get a move on it, we don't have
time for games!&quot;<BR>
So we left the boy, the retarded, deaf, dumb child who now had
a &quot;mashed head&quot; and &quot;looked like a steak,&quot;
bleeding and half conscious in his mother's black and blue arms.
My conscience agonized me. I had taken part in the beating of
this helpless child. I kept hearing the wail of his mother, as
she threw herself on us trying to spare her son from further harm,
echo in my mind. I tried to talk to my fellow soldiers about the
incident as we headed on for more confrontations saying, &quot;What
we did was wrong. It was barbaric. It was gross. I'm ashamed of
myself!&quot;<BR>
I was laughed off, told, &quot;Don't be silly. Don't be a sissy.
Don't be a wimp!&quot;<BR>
I began to wonder. Are wimps the only ones then who have consciences?
Is it manly to beat a woman and make her retarded, deaf, dumb
child look like a steak and mash his head in? Was I super macho
now that I had helped &quot;tame&quot; both mother and small son?
Then what would be considered cowardly?<BR>
I slipped away from my patrol and approached a journalist. &quot;My
platoon commander made us beat a woman and her mentally retarded
deaf and dumb child,&quot; I told him.<BR>
The journalist, looking like he hadn't bathed in days, spit out
his cigarette and answered, &quot;Look friend, first of all, your
commander is going to deny what happened. Second of all, he will
stop you from talking to journalists from here on out. More importantly,
it's nothing we haven't heard before. It's not news, it's not
interesting and people are fed up with such stories.&quot;<BR>
I walked away, burning with shame, heavy with sweat, curious at
just what was considered &quot;newsworthy&quot; these days.<BR>
Our Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu is at the Nye Plantation
in Maryland, U.S.A. bargaining off more Palestinian land and rights.
He has made it possible for things to turn out this way, for soldiers
like me to shoot at and beat small children. Small children who
fight for the liberation of their country. His skimming over aberrations
causes them to become the norm. There is a transition going on,
from shots fired in the air as warning for demonstrators, to clubs,
from clubs to shooting at legs, and from shooting at legs to shooting
to kill.<BR>
How many Palestinian Jack be Nimbles will die today? How many
Israeli soldiers like me will have to live with their consciences
for the atrocities we commit against the innocents? When does
death become the norm? What new and horrific aberrations will
become our norm tomorrow?<BR>
My stomach is not so strong and my mechanism of repression not
so solid. The image of the child haunts me. Where will it all
end?</P>
