<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel destroys more Arab homes in West Bank</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (4 December)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Consistent with its racist policy toward the Palestinians,
Israel has escalated the extremely harsh  practice of demolishing Arab homes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> On Wednesday 3 December, the Israeli army destroys at
least two residential homes belonging to poor Palestinian villagers at al
Sawahra al Sharkiya near Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, bulldozers driven by
Israeli soldiers also destroyed a third home at the village of Aleizariya
(Bethany) on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two demolished homes near Bethlehem belonged to Khleif
Ramadan Za'atreh, 30, and Mahmud Eibidat, respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eyewitnesses said crack troops stormed the al Sawahra al
Sharkiya on Wednesday morning, cordoned off the first home, giving dwellers
a one-hour grace to get their belongings because &quot;we are going to destroy
your home.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On hearing the &quot;shocking ultimatum,&quot; Khleif's
mother, 75, fainted and was transferred to hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I didn't know what to do, to comfort my family, or
accompany my mother to hospital, or watch my home which I built brick by
brick using up all my savings of 15 years...may God help me,&quot; said
Khlief, father of five children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After fulfilling the first part of  &quot;mission brutality,&quot;
the same IDF bulldozer moved to a neighboring home belonging to Mahmud Ebeidat,
repeating the same evil act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Israeli troops destroyed a multi-story house
at al Eizariya belonging to Abdul Rahman Ali Naser Hubani.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The three homes, say Palestinians, are located in the midst
of Arab residential areas, and the land on which they were built is not
slated for bypass roads or Jewish settlements, the usual Israeli pretexts
for destroying Arab homes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians contend the real motive behind the demolition
is to prevent Arab demographic expansion in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another more fundamental reason lies in wanting to torment
Palestinians and make their life in Palestine unbearable that they would
eventually contemplate leaving their home-country.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians hope OIC will adopt strong stance
on Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (3 /12/ 1997):</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority officials have voiced optimism that
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) summit in Tehran next week
will take a strong stance on Jerusalem and the looming dangers imperiling
Islamic shrines in the town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Amre, a close advisor to PA Chairman Yaser Arafat,
said the Palestinian leadership was expecting &quot;tangible results&quot;
from the OIC summit on two levels, the bilateral relations between Iran
and the PA, and a meaningful collective Islamic stance to counter Israeli
intransigence and insolence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We will have a meaningful dialogue with our Iranian
brothers and friends in order to overcome the misunderstandings that have
blemished our relations,&quot; said Amre in a telephone interview from his
home in Hebron on Wednesday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amre added that the PA &quot;is having paramount interest
in the conference and is looking forward to seeing strong and tangible decisions
supportive of Palestinian rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The battle of Jerusalem has begun, and the OIC must
take not of that, because al Quds is first and foremost an Islamist issue,
after all,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian delegation to the OIC summit will be headed
by PA Chairman Yaser Arafat who would deliver &quot;a key speech&quot; at
the conference, accentuating frantic Zionist efforts to obliterate the Islamic
identity of Jerusalem and the perils facing the Aksa Mosque and other Islamic
holy places in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a chief spokesman of the PA, said Arafat
would urge Muslim leaders to &quot;find ways and means to strengthen the
Islamic presence in Jerusalem.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Rudeineh also said Arafat would demand that the Islamic
states put a collective stance against Israel and its insolent disregard
for Palestinian rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Relations between Iran and the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) and latter the PA underwent up-and-down episodes since Iranian Islamic
revolution in 1978.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Initially, the new revolutionary government in Tehran lauded
PLO chairman Yaser Arafat and even turned the former Israeli embassy into
&quot;embassy of Palestine.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, relations deteriorated afterwards for two reasons,
PLO backing of Iraq during the 8-year Iraq-Iran war and the conclusion of
the Oslo Accords, which the Islamic Republic viewed as &quot;tantamount
to treachery.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli soldiers shoot 40 Palestinians in
Bethlehem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (29 November)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As many as 40 Palestinians were injured when Israeli occupation
soldiers opened live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas at Palestinian
demonstrators protesting the continuing detention of Itaf Elayan, an Islamic
Jihad activist on a hunger strike since here abduction by Israeli soldiers
38 days ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to eyewitnesses, more than 5000 Palestinians
marched through Bethlehem streets Saturday afternoon, demanding the release
of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, when the protesters drew closer to the Bilal Mosque
(Rachel Tomb), Israeli soldiers guarding the site opened fire and rubber
bullets, and gas canisters, indiscriminately, injuring scores of Palestinians,
young and old.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A foreign journalist at the site used the term &quot;mayhem&quot;
to describe the situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I am sure they wouldn't use this sort of violence
with their own people...They (Israeli soldiers) are treating the Palestinians
as inferior people..&quot; the journalist said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Muslims as well Christians took part in the demonstration,
and followers of Fatah, Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and the leftist groups
also took part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Scores of people suffocated as a result of gas inhalation,
and ambulances were transferring people to hospitals until after 4:00 GMT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Palestinian legislative council member, Salah al Ta'amari,
was also lightly injured.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Further protests in solidarity with Elayan also took place
in Hebron, Ramallah, Jenin, and Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Jenin, a letter written by Elayan and leaked from Ramle
hospital, where she is being detained, called on Palestinians &quot;not
to let us down.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More protests are expected for this week.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian protests continue in solidarity
with Elayan</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (26 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Protests, sit-ins and demonstrations continued throughout
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for the fourth consecutive week in solidarity
with political prisoner Itaf Elayan, the Islamist activist abducted last
month by Israeli soldiers while traveling from Bethlehem to Beir Zit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday, Palestinians representing various political
orientations held silent protests outside Red Cross offices in several Palestinian
towns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Hebron, protesters urged human rights organization to
double their efforts on Elayan's behalf, because even the life of one human-being
&quot;matters.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamic Jihad activists renewed earlier warning that &quot;we
would carry out a massive retaliation if <I>something</I> happened to sister
Elayan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli intelligence seems to take these threats seriously.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli English daily, <I>the Jerusalem Post,</I> quoted
intelligence officials as saying they suspected that the Islamic Jihad organization
was responsible for last week's fatal shooting of a Jewish settler in East
Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, himself a former
freedom prisoner, joined Palestinian protests in Gaza in solidarity with
Elayan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin said the Palestinians wouldn't rest until &quot;all
prisoners are released.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He mentioned Itaf Elayan by name, saying that &quot;we
are with you sister Itaf and we want you to know that you are not alone
and that we will not let you down.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin also lambasted the Palestinian Authority for &quot;keeping
Palestinian political prisoners in Palestinian jails,&quot; saying &quot;how
could we demand the release of our brothers and sisters from Israeli jails
while the Palestinian National Authority continues to incarcerate political
prisoners.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Further protests in solidarity with Elayan are scheduled
for Saturday and Monday, in Bethlehem, Hebron and Beir Zit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday, Elayan sent what was described as &quot;an
open letter&quot; to Israeli and world public opinion on the circumstances
of her unlawful arrest and detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The letter, excerpts of which were published by Wednesday's
Arabic press, said Elayan would continue her hunger strike, now entering
its 34 days, until either freedom or martyrdom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Entitled &quot;to all those willing to listen,&quot; the
letter pointed out that Elayan's detention was utterly illegal and that
the Israeli goal behind it was &quot;to break my will.. and that will never
happen.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elayan disclosed that Israeli interrogators had informed
her &quot;not to bank much on justice because all Israeli judged are inside
our rear pockets.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She added that &quot;I shall continue in my just hunger
strike until I earn my freedom, and even then, I shall continue to struggle
against this oppressive law that enables occupation soldiers to detain haphazardly
any Palestinian without charge or trial and for as long as seen fit by the
occupation authorities.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elayan added, rather ominously, that &quot;I am a committed
Muslim and my religious convictions are incompatible with suicide, but this
(hunger strike) is my only means in the face of those oppressors.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA dismisses Netanyahu's initiative as &quot;just
another </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>evasive tactic&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (24 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority officials have rejected a reported
proposal by Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu to redeploy Israeli troops
from 6%-8% of area (C) in return for Palestinian consent to enter final
status talks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Abdul Rahman, Secretary-General of the PA ministerial
council, described the proposal as &quot;another evasive tactic aimed at
absolving Israel from carrying out commitments under the Oslo Accords.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking in Gaza, after a meeting of the PA cabinet and
the PLO executive committee, Abdul Rahman said the Palestinians rejected
the proposal outright, insisting on full implementation of the interim agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli proposal, reported by the Israeli media Sunday
night, stipulates also that the key and third phase of Israeli army redeployment
from the West Bank (except from settlements and military positions) be canceled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They want to lump interim and final status issues
so that at the end we would end up with a dismal deal,&quot; said Abdul
Rahman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu has sought to stall the second redeployment altogether
or reduce its scope to negligible proportions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier this year, Netanyahu suggested that the second
phase of redeployment covers 2%-3% of area (b) where Israel has &quot;security
responsibility&quot; and the PA &quot;civilian responsibility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with an ostensibly determined Palestinian rejection
of a token redeployment, and reportedly with growing American displeasure,
Netanyahu has been forced to come up with his new proposal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The proposal has a &quot;Zero probability&quot; of success,
since its acceptance by the Palestinians would amount to the &quot;undoing
of Oslo&quot; from the Palestinian perspective.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA logic has so far been that when Israel and the PA
embarked on the final status talks, the Palestinians would have significant
chunks of the West Bank, perhaps up to 80% of the total area of the West
Bank, under their control, thus strengthening their negotiating position.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Netanyahu faces a stiff opposition from some
of his key coalition partners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, Michael Kleiner, who heads the so-called &quot;land
of Israel front&quot; said his front would seek to topple the Netanyahu
government if he went ahead with his proposal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In the past months we have met with Netanyahu on
several occasions and warned him that if he crosses the red line we will
topple the government. We have nothing further to say to him.&quot; said
Kleiner in an interview with the Israeli press Monday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, National Religious Party leaders made similar
threats against Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yitzhak Levy, of the NRP, said &quot;his party would leave
the government if the IDF left the parts of the land of Israel they are
talking about.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Additional threats also came of Rahba'am Zeivi, head of
the ultra-right wing party, Moledet, which calls for the expulsion of Arabs
from Palestine to the Arabian Peninsula.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We will bring down the government if Netanyahu makes
good on his remarks on redeployment,&quot; Zeivi said in an interview with
the Israeli radio Monday morning .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli army bulldozers demolished
two Palestinian homes in the Bethlehem area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, the two homes (sheltering
two families) were destroyed allegedly because they were built without license.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians point out that Israeli refuse deliberately
to grant Palestinians building licenses in order to impede Arab demographic
growth, thus forcing Palestinians to build homes without licenses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The destruction by Israel of Palestinian homes has by far
been the second most callous and evil practice against Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If a Palestinian wants to express extreme condemnation,
he Says &quot;Yikhrib Beitak,&quot; may your home be destroyed.<BR>
