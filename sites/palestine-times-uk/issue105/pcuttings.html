    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Beirut-</b> In the decade since Lebanon's civil war ended, this country
    has tried to rebuild from the ruins by forgetting the brutality of the past.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">To many Lebanese, it seemed the only way out of a conflict in which all
    sides committed unspeakable atrocities.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">But Asaad Shaftari, 44, who rose to second in command of the right-wing
    Lebanese Forces during the 15-year civil war, stunned Lebanon this month with a statement
    extraordinary in its simplicity and honesty.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">He publicly asked for forgiveness.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In a letter addressed to his victims ''both living and dead,'' he became
    the first high-level militia leader to apologize for the thousands that he and his
    Christian militia contributed to the 70,000 deaths in Lebanon's agony of war.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem-</b> Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested Sunday that he
    would agree to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, making for the clearest
    indication yet of his willingness to meet a key Syrian demand for peace.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak told his Cabinet that four Israeli prime ministers effectively
    agreed to withdraw from the Golan if certain conditions were fulfilled, his office said. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials had in the past denied that such commitments were made,
    saying that previous offers were hypothetical. Barak's admission appeared designed to
    boost his credibility by assuring Israelis that other leaders also had agreed to return
    the Golan.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and an aide to former Prime Minister
    Benjamin Netanyahu, both from the hawkish Likud Party, denied Sunday having ever agreeing
    to a full Israeli withdrawal. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">PARIS-</b> Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France came close to
    celebrating a highly successful first 1,000 days in office today. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, however, he awoke to an avalanche of criticism, as journalists
    and political analysts here replayed the weekend's events before examining what most
    considered to be his biggest political blunder to date: his trip to the Middle East. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Splattered across France's newspapers were less than flattering images:
    Mr. Jospin running from a mob or huddling in his car as Palestinian demonstrators kicked
    it. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">On Saturday, Mr. Jospin angered the Arab world, departing from France's
    usual cautious diplomacy to call acts committed by Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon
    &quot;terrorist.&quot; But back home the blunder was as much about French politics as
    about Arab-Israeli peace talks.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">When David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, shouted to parliamentary
    deputies this week that Lebanese children would die if Hizbollah Islamist guerrillas fired
    rockets into Israel, his outburst shocked many Israelis. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Never before, they said, had Israel threatened under certain conditions to
    murder Lebanese children. How, they asked, could Ehud Barak, the prime minister, condone
    such statements. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The pictures of Mr Levy raging from the Knesset podium were quickly
    broadcast across the Arab world, serving to illustrate the increasingly sharp anti-Zionist
    articles published against Israel by the Arab media. Israeli officials were not surprised
    by the reaction, saying they had become accustomed to such cartoons and editorials,
    especially in the Egyptian press.</p>

    to Israel on March 21.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The freeze was originally timed for February 21 but was pushed back first
