<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">PA, Israel resume &quot;war of words&quot;<br>
in the aftermath of Taba talks</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khaled Amayreh</b><br>
Less than forty eight hours after the Taba talks, which lasted for six days and which both
sides initially described as &quot;serious, deep and comprehensive,&quot; the Palestinian
Authority and the Zionist regime resumed their &quot;war of words,&quot; suggesting that
their erstwhile positive appraisal<br>
of the talks was but no more than a public relations ruse aimed at helping to save Israeli
premier Barak from his looming downfall.<br>
The First salvo came from Yasser Arafat while giving his customary annual speech before
the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland on 28 January.<br>
Arafat accused the Israeli occupation authorities, rather rightly, of seeking to destroy
Palestinians, people and economy and even homeland.<br>
He pointed out that Barak and the preceding government of Benyamin Netanyahu practiced the
policy of economic strangulation, closure and siege as well as starvation and collective
punishment against the Palestinian people.<br>
&quot;The current government of Israel is waging, for the last four months, a savage and
barbaric war as well as a blatant and fascist military aggression against our Palestinian
people.&quot;<br>
Arafat pointed out that the Israeli army was using internationally prohibited weapons and
ammunitions that include in their construction depleted uranium.<br>
He further explained that Israel was laying against the Palestinians total siege and is
even imposing this siege against every village and town and barring the freedom of
movement and travel of Palestinians even within their immediate communities.<br>
&quot;Israel is violating our human rights, dismissing our workers, closing our factories,
destroying our farms and fruit trees and prohibiting export and import, indeed it is
prohibiting us to receive donated relief provisions.in utter violation of the Fourth
Geneva Convention and the Universal<br>
Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;<br>
Israeli minister for Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres, who had wild dreams of
transforming the ME into a fairy-land of economic opportunity and wealth, was depressed by
Arafat's tone.<br>
He, in a defensive reflex, said that &quot;I came for marriage not for divorce.&quot;<br>
Soon, after Arafat made his statements, which are actually an understatement of Israel's
genocidal war on the essentially unarmed and unprotected Palestinian civilian population,
PA officials began to speak negatively of the Taba talks, accusing the Israeli government
and Barak of playing with words and of lacking the will and the inclination to reach a
real final settlement of the conflict.<br>
PA official Ahmed Qrei, who headed the PA team to the Taba talks, told the Voice of
Palestine on 29 January that the talks achieved no more than &quot;a one-thousandth of the
desired results.&quot;<br>
Asked why he initially gave a positive assessment of the talks, Qrei said &quot;we didn't
want to be carriers of bad news, we wanted to show our people that their struggle and
great uprising is achieving something.&quot;<br>
Meanwhile, Barak, faced with what seems to be an ineluctable election nightmare on 6
February, ruled out any political contacts with Arafat until after the election, assuming
that he would be the winner.<br>
He accused Arafat of an unleashing an &quot;attack of lies&quot; against Israel.<br>
&quot;After we heard Arafat's comments in Davos yesterday which were a full-fledged attack
on the army and an attack of lies on the state of Israel, there is no point continuing
discussions these days,&quot; Barak told the Israeli army radio on 29 January.<br>
He said he had called off all political contacts with the Palestinians but said security
cooperation would continue.<br>
Arafat and Barak had been scheduled to meet in Stockholm on 30 January to follow up the
Taba talks, seen by many as Barak's last chance to convince the Israeli Jewish public as
well as the one million strong Arab community to give him another chance to make peace.<br>
<br>
<u><b>The Taba Talks</b></u><br>
High ranking Israeli and PA officials concluded the intensive &quot;marathon talks&quot;
at the Egyptian resort of Taba on 27 January without reaching an agreement on the
fundamental final status issues such as al-Qods and refugees.<br>
Both sides described the talks as &quot;substantive, serious and deep,&quot; and voiced
the hope that their contacts would be resumed after the Israeli prime ministerial
elections scheduled for 6 February.<br>
PA official Ahmed Qrei said the talks as a &quot;negotiation engagement that covers all
fundamental aspects of the conflict.&quot;<br>
&quot;This is the first time we discuss the core -issues in such a deep and detailed
manner.&quot;<br>
Never the less, Qrei pointed out that the main gaps pertaining to the refugees' right of
return and al-Qods (Jerusalem) remained outstanding and wide.<br>
&quot;There is still a big gap on everything.I am sure that whatever we achieve will be
the starting point of any (future) negotiations. This is a fierce battle, a battle which
has two red lines, one set by us and, unfortunately, one set by them. If they will not
recognize the right of return, there<br>
would be no progress.&quot;<br>
Qrei warned that the Palestinian people would adopt &quot;other ways and means&quot; to
achieve their usurped rights if the extremist Likud leader and candidate Ariel Sharon won
the elections and decided ignore the peace process.<br>
PA Preventative Security Chief in Gaza Muhammad Dahlan said that atmospherics in which the
talks were held were &quot;more reasonable than eve before.&quot;<br>
He suggested in an interview with the Israeli state-run radio on 28 Januarythat the two
sides would have reached an agreement had there been more time available.<br>
It is not clear what made Dahlan made such a daring statement especially in light of what
Qrei, who headed the PA negotiations' team to the Taba talks, said about the talks
achieving only one thousandth of the requisite outcome. <br>
Could it be that Dahlan's agenda is different from that of Qrei?<br>
On the Zionist side, Israeli officials assessed the talks positively, saying the two sides
have never been closer to an agreement than they are now.<br>
Yossi Sarid, who participated in the negotiations, spoke of the talks as the &quot;most
successful talks to be conducted with the Palestinians.&quot;<br>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak claimed that Israel was able to extract from the
Palestinians during the talks an agreement to allow between 50-60% of Jewish settlers in
the West Bank under Israeli sovereignty.<br>
He added that Israel was demanding that up to 80% of the settlers ought to remain in the
West Bank, which means their settlements would have to be annexed to the Jewish states.<br>
Moreover, Barak pointed out that Israel wouldn't &quot;relent&quot; its stance on the
issue of the right of return for the refugees, adding that the Palestinians were showing
understanding of the Israeli position. <br>
Barak, who was speaking in an election tour on 28 January, opined that the general
features of a final status agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority were
being drawn.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Election spin</b></u><br>
Again, it is amply clear that much of the optimism surrounding the talks is artificial and
meant to help Barak catch up with Sharon.<br>
The two main issues impeding the conclusion of an agreement, the refugees' right of return
and the issue of Jerusalem, are still outstanding, and whatever progress made on this two
issues seems to be superficial and virtually insignificant.<br>
Indeed, Ahmed Qrei alluded to the stark gap on the right of return when he remarked that
&quot;this is a fierce battle, a battle which has two red lines, one set by us and,
unfortunately, one set by them. If they will not recognize the right of return, there
would be no progress.&quot;<br>
In any case, it seems that whatever tacit understandings the Barak government and the PA
leadership may have reached will ultimately hinge on the outcome of the upcoming prime
ministerial elections in Israel.<br>
And for the PA, it is better they begin to prepare for the second advent of Sharon, the
hero of the massacres of the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camp who is about to be elected as
Israel's next prime minister.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israeli settlers, troops, go on <br>
the rampage following Kahana's death</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special for PT</strong><br>
In a desperate effort to woo some right-wing Jewish voters ahead of the Israeli prime
ministerial election, and also to further pressure Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat into accepting recent American proposals on a prospective final status deal with
the Palestinians, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has once again resorted to sabre-rattling and
pugnacity.<br>
On 2 January, Barak instructed his army to &quot;shake off the dust&quot; and get ready
for a possible war in the region, the likelihood of which, he said, would increase
significantly if and when the current diplomatic efforts reached a dead end.<br>
Barak also decided to take renewed stringent measures against the Palestinian self-rule
areas, including blockading all Arab towns and villages, closing all crossing points from
and to the PA enclaves, and withdrawing VIP cards from a number of PA officials.<br>
Barak's sabre-rattling came during an emergency meeting of his security cabinet a few
hours after a car-bomb explosion rocked the Jewish town of Netanya, 51 miles north of Tel
Aviv.<br>
Scores of Israelis were mostly slightly injured in the incident, which Israeli officials
initially blamed on Yasser Arafat and his Fatah organization. However, it turned out that
Hamas carried out the bombing. Israel retaliated on 31 December when Israeli undercover
units assassinated Dr. Thabet, Fatah's Secretary-General in the Tulkarm district and a
senior official at the PA health ministry.<br>
Thabet, an erstwhile peace supporter who had initiated &quot;the Palestinian committee for
dialogue and understanding with the Israeli people,&quot; was shot outside his home by a
sharpshooter in a military truck positioned at a distance of about 200 metres from his
house on the main road south of Tulkarm.<br>
Thabet, 50, was reportedly hit by 3-4 bullets in the chest, and eventually succumbed to
his wounds on the way to hospital. During his funeral on 1 January, thousands of Fatah
activists demanded retaliation, shouting &quot;revenge, revenge, sooner rather than
later.&quot;<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Escalation in violence<br>
</u></strong>The &quot;liquidation&quot; of Thabet, as the Israeli army referred to the
murder, coincided with a new bloody escalation by Israeli occupation soldiers and settlers
against Palestinians soon after the Eid Al-Fitre holiday, which witnessed a relative lull
in confrontations.<br>
The bloody rampage, which in several instances took the form of blanket and random
artillery bombardment of Palestinian civilian neighbourhoods in Hebron and Nablus and to a
lesser extent in the Gaza Strip, killed at least six Palestinians.<br>
Among the victims were two children, a 10-year-old in Hebron by the name of Mouath Abu
Hadwan and a 4-year-old in Nablus by the name of Abdul Rahman Ikhdeish; both were inside
their homes when they were hit and killed by shrapnel from Israeli shells.<br>
A 22-year-old boy, identified as Tahrir Suleiman Rizk, was also killed on 21 December when
heavily armed Israeli settlers entered the village of Hizma, north-west of Jerusalem, and
began a shooting spree, killing the boy instantly.<br>
The settlers fled the village, reportedly under the protection of Israeli army troops.<br>
Two more Palestinian security officers were also murdered near Tulkarm during the night on
31 December, apparently after they had been kidnapped and tortured by undercover Israeli
soldiers.<br>
Palestinian sources said marks of violence were found on the bodies of the victims who
were completely naked.<br>
Another ugly incident , which speaks volumes, took place in Hebron on 1 January, when
Israeli occupation soldiers shot an elderly Palestinian man without the slightest
provocation and even prevented Palestinians from giving him first aid or transferring him
to hospital.<br>
According to eyewitnesses, Israeli soldiers stopped Jadallah Jabari, 50, a sanitation
worker, and while they were talking to him, one soldier suddenly and nonchalantly shot him
in the leg, which doctors had to amputate later.<br>
The incident, say Palestinians, underscores the haphazardness and indifference with which
Israelis treat Palestinian lives, which gives credence to Palestinian demands for
international protection against a wanton savagery and repression of which only a small
portion find its way to television screens.<br>
The centre of Hebron, where the shooting occurred, had been under intermittent curfew
since the outbreak of the intifada more than three months ago.<br>
The 24-hour curfew does not apply to Jewish settlers who, while Arabs are confined to
&quot;their cages,&quot; often get busy attacking Arab homes and vandalizing their
property, often in the full view of acquiescing Israeli occupation soldiers.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Kahana assassination<br>
</u></strong>The bloody rampage against Palestinian civilians coincided with the killing
by Palestinian assailants on 31 December of Benyamin Zev Kahana, the arch-terrorist who
heads the nefarious Jewish group known as &quot;Kahana Hay&quot;, which openly calls for
the expulsion and/or extermination of all Palestinians in mandatory Palestine.<br>
Palestinian guerillas, believed to be affiliated with either Hamas or the Islamic Jihad,
attacked Kahana's car near the Jewish settlement of Ufra in the early morning hours with
automatic weapons, killing him, his wife and injuring five other settlers who were in the
car.<br>
The slain terrorist is the son of the late Rabbi Meir Kahana, founder of the Jewish
Defense League and the Kach terrorist group, responsible for numerous murderous attacks on
Palestinian and Arab targets in Palestine as well as the United States.<br>
An Egyptian-born American citizen, Sayed Nuseir, who couldn't bear Kahana's brash racism
against Arabs and Muslims, killed Meir Kahana in New York in November 1990.<br>
The sinister ideology of the Kahanas found expression in several books written by Meir
Kahana, including his infamous book, <em>They Must Go</em>, published in New York in 1981,
in which the racist rabbi urged the Israeli government to adopt a policy of expulsion
against the Palestinians in order to maintain the racial purity of the Jewish State.<br>
Another Kach arch-terrorist, Baruch Goldstein, murdered 29 Arab worshippers on 25
February, 1994 while they were praying at dawn at the Ibrahimi Mosque in downtown Hebron.<br>
In 1983, Kach terrorists attacked the Hebron University Campus in Hebron, killing 2
students and wounding 15 others. Three years earlier, Kach terrorists placed time-bombs in
the cars of three Arab mayors, seriously injuring and maiming one of them, the former
Mayor of Nablus Bassam al-Shaka'a.<br>
The killing of Kahan, Jr,. has sounded alarm bells in the Israeli security establishment,
which warned that Jewish terrorists might now carry out &quot;qualitative attacks&quot; on
&quot;qualitative targets&quot;, such the Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, and/or embark on
massacres against Palestinians similar to that which Goldstein committed at the Ibrahimi
Mosque in Hebron nearly seven years ago.&nbsp; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Right of return pushed to the fore</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron (West Bank) &#150; Special for PT</strong><br>
(After half a century of homelessness and dispersion to the four winds, and despite
Israel's determined efforts to consign the &quot;right of return&quot; to oblivion,
Palestinian refugees are successfully reasserting their<br>
inalienable right to return to their hometowns and villages in what is now Israel.) </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians have been taking to the streets on the West Bank, Gaza and
also in the Diaspora (wherever allowed) to reassert the &quot;right of return&quot; (ROR)
for the estimated 4 million Palestinian refugees who were either expelled at gunpoint by
Jewish soldiers and irregulars or fled in fear from what is now Israel on the eve of its
establishment in Palestine in 1948. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the West Bank numerous rallies, demonstrations and even academics are
being organized, almost on a daily basis, all for the purpose of underscoring the
inviolability of the right of return and also in order to send an unmistakable warning to
&quot;all concerned,&quot; including Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, against
ignoring or compromising that right. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the activities promoting the ROR awareness are being overseen by
the Nablus-based Committee for the Defense of the Palestinian Refugee Rights (CDPRR)
headed by Palestinian Legislative Council member Husam Khader of the Balata refugee camp,
himself a son of a refugee. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The CDPRR is non-partisan and accepts in its membership all Palestinians,
Arabs, Muslims and international supporters willing to devote their time and money to
expedite the attainment of the right of return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, the committee started a campaign throughout the occupied
territories aimed at signing the &quot;right of return honour oath&quot; by as many
refugees as circumstances allow. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The oath states that &quot;I swear by God to reaffirm my adherence to the
right of return to my locality (in Palestine) from which I was (my parents were) evicted
by the Zionist invaders. I further declare that I have not delegated anybody to renounce
this right and I reject any and every alternative proposal for my resettlement.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khader described the signing of the oath, which also received widespread
coverage in the local and pan-Arab media, such as satellite television stations, as a
remarkable success so far. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;This effort is meant to achieve two goals: keeping the right of
return cause vocal and at the fore of all discussions pertaining to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and, second, enforcing the determination of the refugees to
insist on the realization of the ROR and reject any conceivable alternative to it.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khader pointed out that never since the Palestinian Nakba or catastrophe
in 1948 has the right of return gained so much momentum and awareness of its central
importance among the refugees themselves and the overall Palestinian people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I can tell you that we have succeeded in convincing much of the
world that the right of return is the heart of the Palestinian problem and that without
granting the refugees that right there can be no durable peace in the region.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Khader, like most Palestinians, is harbouring any illusions about
Israel's adamant refusal to allow a considerable influx of refugees to return to pre-1967
territory. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that he was not counting on Israel to relent on this
matter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We know this quite well, but this is not our problem. We can't allow
ethnic cleansing to win. We will continue to stress this matter day and night. We can't
allow ourselves to rest because the right of return is a matter of life or death for the
refugees and the Palestinian national cause as a whole. The refugees' cause is the
Palestine cause.&quot; </p>
<strong><u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Canada's offer under suspicion</u></strong><br>
Palestinian determination to cling to the right of return also found expression last week
when refugees and other activists in the West Bank, and also in Lebanon, burned an effigy
and several portraits of Canadian Foreign Minister John Manley who reportedly had
suggested that Canada would be willing to settle some Palestinian refugees on its soil.<br>
<br>
The offer was lauded by Israeli negotiator Gilad Sher as &quot;a much-appreciated effort
to solve one of the toughest issues of the<br>
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, the PA, and Palestinians generally, viewed it with suspicion and questioned its
timing, coming in the aftermath of former U.S. President Clinton's proposal which ruled
out the refugees' return to their original hometowns and villages.<br>
<br>
PA official Ahmed Qrei described the Canadian offer as &quot;probably good in its intent
but disastrous in its implications and political ramifications.&quot;<br>
<br>
He decried the very idea of banishing the Palestinian refugees once again to what he
called a new Diaspora.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever heard of leaders anywhere in the world who ask foreign countries to
accept their people&#133;we are not going to distribute our people to other nations.&quot;<br>
<br>
A stronger reaction came from Fatah and Islamist leaders in the West Bank who in a joint
statement described the Canadian offer as &quot;not innocent at the very best and
malicious at worst.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We suggest that the Canadian government display evenhandedness by offering to absorb
a million Israeli Jewish settlers in order to facilitate the return of those homeless
refugees to their ancestral homeland.&quot;<br>
<br>
Disquieted by the indignant reactions to the Canadian flyer, Manley instructed the
Canadian ambassador to Israel and other Canadian representatives in the region to issue a
&quot;clarification&quot; saying that Canada's motivation was purely humanitarian in
nature.<br>
<br>
Moreover, Manley wrote to Nabil Ayyad, President of the Canadian Palestinian Centre in
Ottawa on 15 January, reiterating Canada's support for United Nations General Assembly
resolution 194 of 11 December 1948, which stipulates that &quot;refugees wishing to return
to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the
earliest<br>
practical date.&quot;<br>
<br>
Manley added that &quot;Canada believes that the Palestinian refugee issue must be
resolved through negotiations by the parties directly concerned, and that this solution
should respect the rights, dignity and human security of the refugees, and should be
consistent with international law.&quot;<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Right of return inalienable<br>
</u></strong>The ostensibly successful efforts by Palestinian refugee leaders (over half
of the Palestinian people are refugees) to push the right of return to the fore of Middle
East discussions accentuate the fact that Palestinians, especially the masses, view the
refugee plight as first and foremost political and legal in nature, not merely
humanitarian, as many in the West view it.<br>
<br>
Indeed, this perception is being consolidated among refugee young generations. <br>
<br>
According to a present statistical study on Palestinian refugee attitudes, sponsored by
the Centre for Refugee Studies at Oxford University and covering samples of Palestinian
refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the occupied territories, 85 % of the randomly
chosen respondents said they wouldn't give up the right of return under any circumstances.<br>
<br>
The study also showed that the younger and more educated refugees were more likely to
cling to the right of return than the older and less-educated fellow refugees.<br>
<br>
The increasing momentum, which the &quot;right of return&quot; is gathering among
Palestinian refugees, is likely to be viewed with a certain amount of ambivalence by the
PA leadership. For the time being, the PA will use this momentum to extract possible
concessions from Israel on the issue, perhaps in the form of getting Israel to agree to
allow several hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Israel, possibly through the
family reunification programme.<br>
<br>
However, in the long run, it is very likely that the PA will find itself on a collision
course with the vast bulk of refugees who would insist on their right to return home,
despite everything</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Tension returns as elections draw nearer </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special for PT</strong><br>
Following a few days of relative quiet, tension and bloodshed re-engulfed much of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in mid-January as the Israeli occupation army kept up its efforts to
subjugate<br>
the uprising and break the will of the Palestinian people to resist Israel's arrogance of
power.<br>
The renewed wave of bloodshed started on 12 January, when Israeli troops in Hebron
brutally murdered a young Palestinian, claiming that he was seen carrying a pistol.<br>
According to eyewitnesses, a number of Israeli soldiers penetrated several hundred metres
into the PA-administered part of Hebron at Shallala Street and shot at point-blank range
22-year-old Faisal Shaker Husseini, who was taking part in a demonstration in support of
the Palestinian refugees' right to return to their homes and towns in pre-1967 Palestine.<br>
The soldiers reportedly shot the man with four bullets to the head and chest and then
dragged him on the ground more than 200 metres up to a settler outpost in Hebron's Old
Quarter. There, the soldiers refused to let Palestinians take the dying man to hospital or
even give him first aid. Husseini bled to death as the apparently gleeful soldiers posed
with nefarious smiles before the camera while jubilant Jewish settlers nearby brought in
sweets to celebrate the killing of the Arab.<br>
The murder of Husseini drew widespread indignation throughout the occupied territories,
and during his funeral procession two days later, thousands of Palestinians shouted
&quot;revenge, revenge.&quot;<br>
Even PA President Yasser Arafat, who many say keeps himself detached from the intifada's
daily happenings, demanded an apology for the murder from Shimon Peres whom he met in Gaza
for three hours on 14 January. <br>
However, Peres, who had never apologized for the more heinous massacre at Qana in South
Lebanon in the Spring of 1996 when he briefly assumed the premiership of the Jewish State
following Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, prevaricated and essentially repeated the routine
statement Israel makes when Palestinians are murdered in such circumstances, namely that
the soldiers opened fire in self defense, etc. <br>
During the funeral, one masked man with a rifle said, &quot;The enemy will continue to
kill us if that costs them nothing; we have to make them pay the price and feel the
pain.&quot;<br>
The Palestinian retaliation came swift on 15 January near the settlement of Navi Dekalim
outside Khan Younis in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. There, Palestinian guerillas
killed a Jewish settler near the protective electric fence surrounding the settlement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing of the settler, the circumstances of which are still not fully
known, was preceded with heavy Israeli bombardment of Palestinian civilian neighbourhoods
in Khan Younis and rocket-firing at a Palestinian outpost, which miraculously inflicted a
few casualties.<br>
Following the settler's death, Jewish settlers, who since the outbreak of the intifada on
28 September have murdered some ten Palestinian farmers in the area where the settler's
body was found, went on the rampage as never before.<br>
Escorted and protected by the Israeli army, about 500 settlers attacked defenseless
Palestinian civilians, burning their homes, cars and greenhouses, for more than four hours
until they were exhausted.<br>
When the Israeli army commander in Khan Younis was asked why he didn't try to stop the
settlers' violence and terror against the Palestinians, he simply said, &quot;It is
imperative that we allow them to vent their anger and frustration.&quot;<br>
Asked again if he would allow Palestinians to vent their frustration on Jews under similar
circumstances, the Israeli commander said, &quot;I'm here to protect Jewish lives.&quot;
He might have added as well &quot;and to torment the<br>
Palestinians.&quot;<br>
In addition to the widespread rampage and vandalism, the Israeli army cut off Gaza from
the outside world, reintroduced roadblocks throughout the Gaza Strip and closed down the
Gaza airport, less than three days after it was partially reopened.<br>
The Draconian measures were not confined to the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank, the Israeli
occupation army besieged and raided several Palestinian villages in the Nablus area, often
beating civilians and smashing their property, particularly electric appliances,
apparently for the purpose of inflicting psychological pain as well as economic losses.<br>
At the village of Salim near Nablus, the occupation army sought to &quot;confine the
population to each in his cage,&quot; using the words of an Israeli army officer. The
curfew was too much for the people of Salim, who have been fed up with the humiliation and
provocation of Israeli soldiers and settlers alike. So, the villagers decided not to heed
the army orders to stay indoors &quot;indefinitely&quot;, a repeatedly barked order
through a loudspeaker fixed on a Jeep's window.<br>
Affronted by the challenge, the soldiers soon pulled the triggers, as they usually do,
killing 21-year-old Madhi Shehadeh Eshtayyeh and injuring several other youngsters whose
&quot;crime&quot; is simply their belief that humans,<br>
unlike animals, should not be &quot;confined to their cages.&quot; <br>
Besides murdering the young Palestinian for refusing to heed the curfew order, the
occupation soldiers also took over the home of a Palestinian family nearby, claiming that
several shots were fired from its direction<br>
the previous night.<br>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had the audacity to claim during a live
interview with the Qatari satellite television station, al-Jazira, on 15 January that
Israel was no longer an occupying power in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br>
&quot;We stopped being an occupying power several years ago as most Palestinians became
under PA control.&quot;<br>
Barak's manifestly mendacious remarks drew angry responses from Palestinian leaders who
described his remarks as &quot;brash lies from beginning to end.&quot;<br>
The speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Qrei remarked that &quot;if
Palestinians were not being tormented by the Israelis, then what would force them to face
the murderous bullets of the Israeli army?&quot;<br>
Islamist leader Hasan Yousef described Barak's claim as &quot;somewhat amusing.&quot;<br>
&quot;It is like placing people inside a cage, and then claim that they are free to move
within it.&quot;</p>

<strong>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Is the PA getting tough with the collaborators?</font></strong></h3>
<strong>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Khaled Amayreh</strong> <br>
Hundreds of Palestinians who have worked or continue to work as informers for
Israel&#146;s main domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, have been turning
themselves in at PA security centres throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<br>
PA security sources indicated that the number of &#147;collaborators&#148; who have
surrendered exceeds 400, of whom include, as one Preventive Security official put it,
&#147;small, medium and big fishes.&#148;<br>
The collaborators, many of whom are well-known within their communities, decided to turn
themselves in apparently to escape the prospects of being shot dead by intifada activists
who rightly accused them of providing the Israeli army with information leading to the
liquidation of intifada activists and leaders.<br>
As many as 20 activists and &#147;field leaders&#148; of the intifada have been
assassinated by the Israeli army and its notorious death squads since the outbreak of the
current intifada on 28 September.<br>
Faced with public pressure to adopt an iron fist toward the quislings, PA Minister of
Justice Freih Abu Maddin gave the collaborators a grace period of 45 days during which, he
said, they would have to turn themselves in and in case they failed to do so, they would
face dire consequences.<br>
Abu Maddin promised that the Shin Bet agents would be tried before normal civilian courts,
not the so-called State Security courts, and that justice would be done. <br>
He also pointed out that repentant collaborators would be re-integrated into the
Palestinian societies, arguing that many of them were themselves victims of the Israeli
occupation and its evil ways.<br>
Abu Maddin&#146;s remarks came in the aftermath of the execution of two collaborators in
Nablus and Gaza who reportedly confessed in court to having worked for the Shin Bet and
provided information that eventually led to the assassination by Israeli undercover units
of at least five Palestinians.<br>
The two were executed by firing squads in Nablus and Gaza on 13 January. The first
informer, Allan Bani Oudeh, was executed in the centre of Nablus in the presence of
hundreds of people who apparently approved his execution. He confessed to having placed a
sophisticated explosive charge provided by his Shin Bet boss in a car driven by Ibrahim
Bani Oudeh, a<br>
prominent member of the Hamas military wing in Nablus nearly two months ago. Bani Oudeh
was immediately killed and badly mutilated when the bomb was detonated by remote control
from an Israeli army helicopter flying over the city.<br>
The other collaborator, Majdi Makkawi of Rafa, likewise confessed to having informed the
Shin Bet of the whereabouts of four Fatah activist who were active in the intifada. The
four were assassinated by the Israeli army six weeks ago.<br>
Two more collaborators were sentenced to death by a firing squad in Bethlehem in
connection with the assassination by Israelis of Hussein Ibayat, the Fatah field leader
who was killed when an Israeli helicopter hit his car with an air-to-ground shell in Beit
Sahur several weeks ago. Two women were also killed with him in the attack on his car.
Three more defendants<br>
were given imprisonment for life.<br>
Meanwhile, the PA radio and television have aired startling confessions by some of the
collaborators who turned themselves in. One collaborator, interviewed by the PA radio
station, the Voice of Palestine, on 17 January, revealed that his Shin Bet boss had
instructed him &#147;to convince his sister to let other collaborators have sex with her
and then videotape the act.&#148;<br>
The collaborator, whose voice was made hoarser to conceal his identity, added that
&#147;when I sought to carry out the instructions, I found that she was already involved
with another collaborator.&#148;<br>
He further added that the Shin Bet treated him very badly and threatened him with
imprisonment and even death if he didn&#146;t do what he was ordered to do.<br>
&#147;They told us they would imprison us, expose us or kill us.&#148;<br>
Another agent said the Israeli intelligence would exploit the urgent human needs of
ordinary Palestinians to blackmail them into working with the Shin Bet.<br>
&#147;They would refuse to give you a permit to take your sick child to hospital in Israel
unless you agreed to collaborate with them.&#148;<br>
In addition to infiltrating and monitoring resistance groups and helping Israeli security
forces liquidate activists, collaborators also often indulge, with Shin Bet acquiescence,
in pornography and drug trafficking. They also help recruit new collaborators, using drugs
and sexual blackmail.<br>
On 22 January, scores of disgruntled Shin Bet informers, who had escaped into Israel,
demonstrated outside the Israeli Prime Minister&#146;s office in West Jerusalem, demanding
higher pay and better living conditions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One agent told the Israeli-State run radio that &#147;we are suffering in
an unbelievable manner. We left our homes and towns to serve the Israeli State, and now
they (the Israeli authorities) are treating us like dogs.&#148;<br>
Most of the collaborators and their families have not been welcomed by either Jewish or
Arab communities in Israel, forcing them to live like pariahs in temporary squalid hostels
provided by the Shin Bet. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Who killed Makki?</u></strong><br>
Meanwhile, the PA continued, ostensibly, to investigate circumstances surrounding the
murder of Hisham Makki, 54, the flamboyant and reportedly &#147;filthy-rich&#148; director
of the PA Broadcasting Authority.<br>
Makki, who was smoking a hookah pipe in a luxurious Gaza beach hotel frequented by the <em>crème
de la crème</em> of the Gaza society, was shot dead on 17 January by two masked men with
silenced pistols.<br>
It is not exactly known exactly who killed Makki or, more importantly, who ordered him
killed. <br>
Nevertheless, most observers seem to exclude Israel as the main culprit, suggesting that
the murder was another &#147;internal Palestinian matter.&#148;<br>
A shadowy Palestinian organization, which identified itself as the &#147;Aqsa
regiments&#148;, claimed responsibility for the killing, saying Makki got what he deserved
for stealing the people&#146;s money and for his &#147;lewd and promiscuous
behaviour.&#148;<br>
A leaflet issued by the group also blamed the PA leadership for failing to fight
corruption saying, &#147;We have no choice but to do what the PA ought to have done a long
time ago.&#148;<br>
Initially, the PA media condemned the killing, calling the perpetrators &#147;enemies of
our people,&#148; and even PA chairman Yasser Arafat and other high-ranking PA officials
took part in his funeral procession on 18 January.<br>
However, references to the killing of the &#147;martyr&#148; became briefer and soon
vanished from the PA official and semi-official media. <br>
Moreover, the usual obituary notices which normally inundate PA newspapers when a
prominent official dies, were conspicuously absent this time, suggesting some foul play.<br>
On 20 January, all Makki&#146;s real estate and assets, estimated at US$ 17 million, were
sequestrated by court order. Moreover, his wife and children were banned from travelling
abroad.<br>
Makki used to receive a monthly salary of $2,800. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Palestinian Authority police last month arrested
three Palestinians working for the Israeli intelligence who reportedly helped the Israeli
occupation army assassinate a prominent Fatah activist last December.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA-run radio, the voice of Palestine, quoted an &quot;authorized
security source&quot; as saying the three collaborators, all residents of the Tulkarm
region, confessed to having been involved in the assassination by undercover Israeli
agents on 31 December of Dr. Thabet Thabet, Fatah secretary-General in Tulkarm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The radio said the three also confessed that they were working for

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 13 January, two collaborators who had been convicted of working for the
Shin Bet and involvement in the assassination by Israeli occupation troops of five
intifada leaders were executed in Nablus and Gaza by a firing squad.</p>
