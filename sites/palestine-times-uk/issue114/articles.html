<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The malady and the remedy</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite Israel&#146;s ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people,
which has so far resulted in the killing of some 310 Palestinians&#150;one fourth of them
children&#150;and the wounding and maiming of as many as 12,000 people, the Arab world has
yet to take even one effective measure to make the Nazi-like Israel feel that Palestinian
lives are not expendable and Palestinian blood is not water.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arab leaders did hold a summit in Cairo in October but, as usual, the
outcome was virtually a big, fat zero. The Islamic conference in Doha was not any better.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in both cases, the member States, whether individually or
collectively, demonstrated a startling degree of impotence, incompetence and
powerlessness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In practical terms, the message the bleeding Palestinians received from
both summits is, &#147;We feel sorry for you, but we can&#146;t do anything to help you
because peace is our sole and only strategic option!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians, to be sure, had never expected Arab and Islamic summit
participants to take revolutionary measures against Israel and its ultimate protector and
sustainer&#150;the United States. Needless to say, this would be extremely unrealistic and
even far-fetched, given the fact that some of the OIC member States are bound to the
Zionist regime by a strategic alliance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even the modest demand of severing ties with the criminal Jewish State was
rejected as some Arab and &#147;Muslim&#148; States argued, explicitly rather than
implicitly, that their relations with Israel, and therefore with the Zionist-controlled
U.S., were more important than Palestine, its people and even Jerusalem and al-Aqsa
Mosque!</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Subservience to America</b></u><br>
The manifestly shameful outcome of both the Arab and Islamic summits demonstrated
unequivocally the extent to which most Arab and Islamic countries lack the political
independence and, therefore, political will required to put up any meaningful opposition
to American hegemony in the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, subservience to the White House proved much stronger than
any pretence of pan-Arab or even Islamic solidarity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That is the bad news. The worst news is that this depressive reality is
going to remain intact for as long as the Arab-Muslim masses choose to allow the usurpers
of their will to continue treating them as herds of animals that need only fodder, but
deserve no freedoms or human and civil rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact of the matter is that our calamity with Israel&#150;an outpost of
American and Western imperialism that will disappear sooner or later&#150;is much smaller
than our calamity with the existing Arab and pseudo-Muslim regimes that rule hundreds of
millions of Arabs and Muslims with an iron fist all in the service of Zionism and
Zionist-controlled America.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, all other matters, including the bleeding Palestinian wound, are
merely residual symptoms of the Arab-Muslim malady, which impedes Arab-Muslim unity and
perpetuates the present state of paralysis throughout the Muslim world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, it would be futile and unrealistic to count on the member States of
the Arab League to take a truly dignified stand in support of the Palestinian uprising
because, as it is said in Arabic, &#147;one can&#146;t give what one doesn&#146;t
have.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, the present Arab reality can be diagnosed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Most Arab regimes do not really represent their peoples, and public
  opinion in most Arab countries has virtually no bearing or effect on government policies
  or actions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Most Arab regimes, are not really answerable to their peoples, but
  rather are ultimately responsible to the United States.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Many influential Arab regimes are not really independent since American
  armies are stationed on their national soil.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">4. The United States and Israel are two sides of the same coin, since
  American policy, not only toward Palestine but toward the entire region, is determined by
  Zionist Jews holding American citizenship but whose hearts, minds and loyalty lie with
  their Jewish-Zionist brethren in Tel Aviv.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">5. An inescapable inference from this is that Arab regimes are indirectly
  and invariably controlled, or at least heavily influenced, by Israel.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">6. This means that most Arab States cannot take effective measures against
  the Zionist regime, irrespective of the amount of young Palestinian blood the Zionist
  Nazis spill in the streets of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">7. The vast bulk of Arab regimes are more concerned with keeping
  themselves in power, by whatever means necessary, than in supporting the Palestinian
  cause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, this should explain the state of individual and collective Arab
powerlessness and paralysis.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The remedy</b></u><br>
The ultimate remedy or solution to the morbidity facing the Arab-Muslim world is to
reinstitute the political authority of Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the first step of expediting this ultimate goal is to dislodge
Arab and Muslim countries from subservience to America.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first step in doing this is the strengthening of the defenses of the
collective Arab-Islamic body and boosting the morale of the Umma through the following
means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fostering the awareness among the masses that the existing regimes are not legitimate in
    any way, not only because they are not elected by the people, but also because they
    connive with the United States against the vital interests of the Umma.</li>
  <li>Fostering the awareness among the masses that they have an absolute religious, human,
    legal, moral and political right to disobey and disregard the authority of these regimes.</li>
  <li>Mobilizing and recruiting free elements (the vanguard ) throughout the Arab-Muslim
    world, who would be willing, even eager, to sacrifice their own lives, for the purpose of
    rooting out American colonization in and of Arab countries. </li>
  <li>Launching a widespread Jihad from Casablanca to Jakarta against the enemies of Islam. </li>
  <li>This Jihad must be guided by true and sublime Islamic principles, and innocent civilians
    must not be targeted under any circumstances, except when Muslim civilians are attacked. </li>
  <li>This Jihad should be very decentralized in order to guarantee continuity and thwart
    enemy repression. </li>
  <li>The forces of Jihad must be willing to offer martyrs and prisoners in the hundreds of
    thousands because the price for freedom will be as precious as freedom itself.</li>
  <li>If Arabs and Muslims cower, then they will only have themselves to blame, and Israel and
    the Zionists would be perfectly free to destroy al-Masjidul Aqsa and even more!</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, the choice is ours: either dignified Jihad or enslavement by the
Zionists and America! </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">It&#146;s Disgusting!</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shehada</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our children are being killed on a massive scale. Our cities are being
bombarded by heavy artillery by the Israeli choppers. Our women and children are becoming
the hunting targets for Israeli snipers. Our lands are being savagely ravaged by the
Israeli ever-expanding cruel occupation and the death toll keeps climbing. The
Palestinians are indeed suffering greatly. They are being collectively tortured. Their
economy is in shambles, their leadership twisted, their breaking point within reach.
Israeli killing is not a tactic but is just part of its strategy which has been in
practice since the emergence of Zionism into our midst. The Jewish State has to remain
predominantly Jewish and the presence of non-Jews among them reminds them of the danger of
diluting their majority with non-Jews. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What are we doing about it? Not much, I am afraid. Three hundred million
Arabs from the Arab Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean and over 1 billion Muslims are simply going
on with their normal lives while all kinds of political charlatans are calling for Arab
unity and Arab support for the suffering of the Palestinian people. Let&#146;s not forget
the summit meetings of Arabs and Muslims who in shameful repetition are
&#147;condemning&#148; Israeli atrocities but that&#146;s as far as it will go.
&#147;Allah Akbar&#148;, &#147;Honor&#148;, &#147;Dignity&#148;, &#147;Freedom&#148;,
&#147;Glory to the Arabs&#148; are nothing but old clichés that have been repeated by our
leaders to put the Arab masses to sleep. They are calling others to do something about
this tragedy, but they should be kept out of any involvement. What&#146;s wrong with the
Arabs, for God&#146;s sake? Do they lack the human and financial resources? Do they lack
weapons? Where are all these sophisticated weapons that were purchased with hundreds of
billions of dollars? Every purchase is explained as weapons to be used against the enemies
of the Arabs and Islam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Desecrating the Aqsa Mosque, killing Arab women and children and the
occupation of Arab lands has not given them a clue as to who the enemy is? Were these
weapons bought to defend the Arabs or to defend the leaders against their own peoples? Are
the people the enemy? Have they ever heard of Zionism and Israel? Have they ever heard of
Israel&#146;s daily cruel atrocities against the Arabs in Palestine? Do they watch TV to
see the daily killing of Arab women and children, or do they use the remote to change the
channel so they don&#146;t have to be reminded of their leadership obligations toward the
oppressed masses? They cannot look at these grotesque scenes that reminds them of these
obligations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not that they are blind, but it&#146;s easier to pretend that they are, so
as to cater to their &#147;friendship&#148; to America and to their &#147;secret&#148;
commitments toward the Zionist enemy. Relations with the U.S. and the Zionist entity
should remain intact and strong and nothing the enemy can do could weaken such relation,
not our bloodshed, not the killing of our women and children, not the caravan of dead
martyrs! Our pride is dead and our low self-esteem has become the goal of such leadership.
Protests by the disgruntled masses are prohibited and our glorious armies are being used
against the masses they were supposed to protect. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Worse yet, the PA leadership is singing the same mantra along with others.
Our destiny, our freedom, our longing for independence and our rights in Palestine have
been subjugated to cater to the personal goals of Mr. Arafat, who is desperately seeking
to become a president of our shambled and dissected patrimony regardless of the heavy
price we have to pay. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The lands of our ancestors have to be sacrificed so that Mr. Arafat would
gain the title of a president on 10% of our lands. Never mind the rights of our children
and their legacy to the lands, never mind the suffering of the Palestinians in the
sub-human conditions of the refugee camps and forget about their rights to return as long
as our &#147;glorious&#148; president has returned with his gang to augment the
Israeli&#146;s control of our destiny. The man who used to fight the enemy is now fighting
those who are presently fighting the enemy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The siege and occupation of our towns and cities by the cruel Israelis
would not change his resolve to join the fight; on the contrary, he is simply offering his
apologies to the enemy while putting in jail all those who are fighting for freedom. How
can a man who used to fight Israel become its protector against his own people? Whatever
happened to the old slogan &#147;liberation from the Jordan river to the sea&#148;? Now
Mr. Arafat has changed the slogan to read &#147;From the Jordan River to the Jordan
River&#148; but with a dent along the river called the West Bank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, never mind the humiliating conditions attached to such a
pathetic &#147;State&#148;. No army, no continuity, no freedom of movement and Israeli
checkpoints will remain a reminder that we are not free. Oslo, which was supposed to
become a venue for freedom, has become the gate to permanent enslavement, and the
Palestinian masses have gained a new oppressor who has joined the U.S. and Israel, namely
the PA. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those who claim that we have no other alternatives have not studied
history and they have not heard of liberation movements whose weapon has been nothing more
than determination. They have never heard of Vietnam, a country with inferior capabilities
that dragged the U.S. into the mud. They have never heard of Nelson Mandela who from his
jail was able to lead his people to total freedom against overwhelming odds. They have
never heard of Afghanistan, a country with modest numbers and inferior weapons and strong
determination that fought the mighty Russian army to gain independence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why is it that most of those who fought for freedom have reached their
goals, while we are still suffering under the cruel yoke of our oppressor? Well! We have a
unique situation where our leaders, instead of fighting alongside the masses, are fighting
alongside the enemy and against our masses. The whole thing is simply disgusting, to say
the least!</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Palestinians die for their land and olive trees</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 October a Palestinian farmer was shot dead by Israeli settlers near
the village of Beit Fourik. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 26 October, a 75-year-old farmer was tortured to death by a group of
settlers near the same location. In between, many farmers have been wounded by armed
settler attacks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The death of those Palestinians was by no means an accident, as many
Palestinian deaths are justified. In both cases, the killing was deliberate and, like
earlier killings, they will go unnoticed and unpunished. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in both cases, the men were harvesting their olive trees, a steadfast
symbol of a confiscated land, stolen at gunpoint. The olive branch has come to be known as
a symbol of peace. For Palestinians, the olive tree is also a symbol of peace, courage,
defiance and life. For the Israeli army and Jewish settlers, the symbol of the olive is
simply death. When many Palestinians innocently believed that the Oslo peace accord was
bringing them a just peace, they rushed to the streets waving olive branches, celebrating
the long awaited justice and peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Seven years later, Palestinians realized that Oslo was nothing but a
wicked experience that brought little peace and much poverty and humiliation. And as they
began to pass by their martyrs one by one as they headed to crowded graveyards, they
attached olive branches to the caskets and around the newly watered graves, a symbol of
continuation and resistance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Olive harvests have always been a festive occasion for most Palestinians,
even for the refugees who own no land or olive trees. Complete strangers help each other
harvest the land. Young children help to clean the olives from small branches that fall as
men and women stand on high ladders, collecting the olives with enthusiasm and a great
sense of joy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Beit Fourik, however, like other Palestinian villages in the West Bank,
has long lost that festive spirit that used to come with the olive harvest. The once small
Israeli Jewish settlement of Eitamar near Nablus has stripped them of their harvest joy,
as armed gangs of settlers are dedicated to stealing Beit Fourik&#146;s land, to burning
and destroying its olive trees and to endlessly expanding at the expense of helpless
villagers. Two years ago, 75-year-old Al-Haj Mohammed al-Zalmout was killed at dawn by a
gang of settlers. The settlers may have feared that the sound of their bullets would
gather nearby farmers, so they surrounded the man and savagely crushed his skull with
rocks. His own son, Udi, then failed to recognize his father&#146;s face. The old
man&#146;s donkey was still there, as were the harvested olives of the remaining four
trees which sat on a nearby blanket. Nothing was done since then to protect Beit Fourik
from barbaric individuals who thought that killing the old man would bring terror to other
villagers, provoking them to abandon their land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the daily assaults, harassment, beatings of young and old farmers,
destruction and seizure of the land by Eitamar settlers, supervised and aided by the
Israeli army, Beit Fourik has never given up its claims to its land or to the remaining
olive trees. As the Israeli army went on the rampage a few weeks ago, shooting, killing
and shelling Palestinian towns and villages with missiles and apache helicopters, Jewish
settlers also went on a rampage. The recent violence and iron fist of the Israeli army was
a golden opportunity for West Bank and Gaza settlers to abuse more Palestinians, including
the villagers of Beit Fourik. It was time to steal more land, to destroy more trees, and
to expand the borders of Eitamar. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 October, Farid Manasra, joined by three other family members, met at
their land to resume their harvest. Despite the expected threats of Eitamar settlers, the
young men insisted on harvesting their olives on time&#150;after all, the land was theirs
as it had been in their family for many generations. Little did the men know, Eitamar
settlers were hiding nearby, waiting for the &#147;zero hour.&#148; Minutes later, Farid
was laying dead after being hit by a bullet, and all his relatives were wounded. There is
little doubt that the young man&#146;s casket was showered with olive branches, as his
fellow villagers held his dead body high with pride, delivering him to the graveyard where
Al-Haj Mohammed al-Zalmout was buried two years ago. And like Al-Haj al-Zalmout&#146;s
olives, Farid&#146;s harvest must have been carried to the grieving family, a gesture of
pride and a vow of resistance. With every drop of blood and every new martyr, Palestinians
grow more attached to their land, to their olive trees and to their harvest. No wonder
Palestinian painters equate the olive trees to ever-standing martyrs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps once we understand the deepening intimacy between Palestinians and
olive trees, which for them is an icon of lasting resistance, we may be able to understand
what a Palestinian poet meant when he said, &#147;If the olive trees knew the hands that
planted them, their oil would have become tears...&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">When the President lies</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During his visit to the Jewish settlement of K&#146;far Dorom in the
southern Gaza Strip on 21 November, Israeli President Moshe Katsav proved again that his
tongue functions much more swiftly than his brain does.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Reacting to Egypt&#146;s decision to recall its ambassador to Israel in
protest against continued Israeli atrocities against the mostly unarmed and unprotected
Palestinian population, Katsav said, referring to Ambassador Muhammed Basiouni, &#147;I
hope he will tell the truth when he returns to Cairo, that Israelis don&#146;t kill
innocent people, don&#146;t shoot passenger cars, and don&#146;t set mosques on
fire.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Without the slightest doubt, Katsav&#146;s remarks are brash and malicious
lies reminiscent of other infamous lies produced by Zionists throughout their relatively
brief history. It was the Zionists who told the world that Palestine was &#147;a land
without a people for a people without a land,&#148; and it was they who claimed that the
Nazi-like Zionist gangs didn&#146;t drive the bulk of the Palestinians out of their
ancestral homeland when Israel was misbegotten in 1948. And now, Mr. Katsav has the
chutzpah to claim that Israel is not killing innocents.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The remarks are so brazenly blatantly false that one is required to belie
his own eyes in order to believe Mr. Katsav.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Katsav&#146;s stark lies would have passed undetected had he made them a
few years ago, when Zionist killers could carry out their dirty missions
&#147;quietly&#148;, away from the eyes of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But now, as the crimes are reported and transmitted live, as they happen,
to every bedroom around the world, the Zionist task of selling their lies to the world
becomes ever more difficult because there are limits to the Zionists&#146; ability to
twist the facts and because one can&#146;t deceive all the people all of the time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, let us go back to Katsav&#146;s remarks. For the sake of argument,
let us ask, is it true that Israeli occupation soldiers and settlers don&#146;t shoot
innocent Palestinians? Is it true they don&#146;t shoot at passenger cars? Is it true they
don&#146;t set mosques on fire?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The answer to all these sophistic queries, as every Palestinian man, woman
and child, and as every reporter, cameraman and human rights activist operating in
Palestine knows quite well, is an absolute and clarion &#147;YES&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, and without indulging in argumentation and debate, we would like
to ask Mr. Katsav, if he is truly interested in knowing the truth (I firmly believe he
isn&#146;t), if Jamal Yazbek, who was killed during the attempted Jewish pogrom against
Nazareth on 8 October, was innocent or not, and if not, please tell us what his crime was?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We would like to ask Mr. Katsav if Isam Judeh Saleh, who was abducted by
Jewish settlers on 9 October while returning home from work at the village of Um Saffa
near Ramallah, and then electrocuted, axed, bludgeoned, his eyes plucked out, and then
shot twice in the head, was innocent or not, and if not, please tell us what his crime
was?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We would like to ask Mr. Katsav if Sayel Sweidan, of the village of Azzun
near Kalkilya, who was abducted and subsequently murdered by settlers also on 9 October,
was innocent or not, and if not, please tell us what his crime was?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We would like to ask you, Mr. President, to tell us if Farid Nassasreh,
the Palestinian farmer who was murdered in front of his children on 17 October while
harvesting his olive crops at the village of Beit Furik near Nablus, was innocent or not,
and if not, please tell us what his crime was. We would also like you to tell us, Mr.
President, what happened to his murderers, Yaron Degani and Gad Tena of the settlement of
Itamar, and why they were not arrested and tried?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We would like to ask you, Mr. President, if 2-year-old Sara Abdul Haq, who
was killed by a Jewish settler&#146;s bullet while returning home from hospital in her
father&#146;s car on 14 October, was innocent or not, and if not, please tell us what her
crime was?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are not going to ask you what you think about the death of Muhammed
Durra, and the other 60 Durras that your murderous and trigger-happy soldiers killed since
28 September, for these are, as your lie-fabricators unashamedly claim, guilty of
intercepting IDF bullets and their mothers sent them to die because sacrificing children
is an old Palestinian custom! Why did the Jews of Ghetto Warsaw send their children beyond
the Nazi lines? Didn&#146;t they worry that the kids might get killed? Were their mothers
so callous?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And you said Israeli soldiers and settlers don&#146;t fire on civilian
cars? Are you sure, Mr. Katsav, that what you are saying is true? Then who killed the four
university students near Rafah on 22 November? And who fired at the school bus in Gaza two
weeks earlier? And who killed 55-year-old Mustafa Mahmoud Ilayan on 14 October while he
was returning home to Nablus from Ramallah, where he worked at a grocery store?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tell us, Mr. President, why you kill those innocent people. Their souls
and innocent blood will continue to chase you and haunt you unceasingly, day and night,
until you go to hell where you belong.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And you said Jews don&#146;t burn mosques? Who then burned and destroyed
all these mosques in Palestine? Do Muslims burn their own mosques? Who set the Mosque of
Hiwwara on fire on 20 October? Who burned the al-Baher Mosque? Who burned the Tabariyya
Mosque? Who demolished the Sarafand Mosque, Mr. President? Who converted as many as 50
mosques in Palestine into night-clubs and dens where vice is practised? Why do you carry
out such ugly deeds, Mr. President? Don&#146;t you claim that you are a heavenly light
upon mankind? Are you really a light or an abomination upon mankind?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, Mr. President, you may think that &#147;goyem&#148; cannot be
innocent since, as the Talmud teaches, the life of a non-Jew is nonessential, or you may
think, as the Talmud teaches, that &#147;the best of the goyem, kill &#145;em.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this kind of thinking, Mr. President, is what had made you incur all
the persecutions, the inquisitions, the pogroms, and eventually the holocaust.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. President, so much has been written and said about the strife in
Palestine, but very few put their hands on the gist of the problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The gist of the problem, Mr. President, is your twisted and deformed
perception of and toward non-Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The problem, Mr. President, is that you think of yourselves as &#147;the
chosen people of God,&#148; and others (e.g. us, the Palestinians) as animals in human
form. Doesn&#146;t it all come down to this in the final analysis?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You may believe as you wish, Mr. President, but everything has a price,
that, sooner or later, will have to be paid.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the Western democracies are waiting for an exodus of Palestinian
refugees before they rein-in Israel, they may have to wait indefinitely, as this is&#133;</i></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;The last stand</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</b><i><strong>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</i>Faced with cries of &#145;death or expulsion&#146; and having no
sovereignty over their territories, this is the last stand by the Palestinian people to
preserve their national identity and existence in occupied Palestine. They are determined,
despite the heavy losses, not to increase the ranks of the world&#146;s 5 million
Palestinian refugees. Their task is undoubtedly a difficult one. But even so, they are not
prepared to wait for the world community to act. Bitter experience has taught them never
to be bitten from the same hole twice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Like every other people who were subjected to foreign rule, the
Palestinians cannot afford the luxury of reading history simply for entertainment. For
them, its primary purpose must be to identify the pitfalls of the past and extract
guidelines for the future. They had with other Arabs risen up against their Ottoman rulers
in support of the European allied war effort with the promise of gaining independence.
Their condition today is, arguably, worse than it was then. They have no control over
their economy or territorial borders. They cannot move freely within their own land
without the permission of the settler. And they cannot trade with fellow Arabs, because
the latter now recognize the borders imposed by the occupier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;This is the background to the current fighting; a people yearning to
be free in their land, to shape their own destiny, and to conduct relations without the
let or hindrance of external forces. Thus, the measure by which these rights are denied is
truly inconceivable. One misconception must be eradicated before any sense can be made of
this gory affair; that is, the Palestinians are not up against three or five million
Jewish settlers only. They are for all practical purposes the sacrificial victims of
Western political wrongdoing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Whereas 100 hundreds years ago the sponsors of this project endorsed
it on the basis of the white man&#146;s burden to civilize the dark peoples of the world,
Westerners today do so in the name of democracy. But what kind of democracy? If Israel is
a model and true representation of the only democracy in the Middle East, then surely the
Palestinians and Arabs have the right to reject it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Here are a people [the Jews] who because of their friendship with
Western colonial powers managed to obtain 57% of Palestine at a time when they only
constituted 33% of the population. Today they are fighting the Palestinians tooth and nail
for what remains of their historic homeland&#150;less than 20%. When confronted with this
injustice, they claim immunity by divine right, dismissing every suggestion that they are
essentially invaders, settlers and occupiers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<u><b>Creating a monster<br>
</b></u>In order to advance this cause, Zionist Israel concluded convenient peace treaties
with the neighbouring Arab States to secure their borders. After agreeing to return the
stolen land for peace in 1993, the Jewish State went ahead and seized another 600,000
dunums of land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since the entire Oslo process turned out
to be a scam to increase their subjugation, the Palestinians have decided to throw all
caution and restraint to the wind. They have nothing to lose now except the repressive
laws that seek to dehumanize them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Under the present situation they have few rights but unlimited
duties. There is no hope. What hope can there be when 6,000 settlers control 42% of the
Gaza Strip and 1.2 million Palestinians are crammed into the remaining 58%? Throughout the
1980s, the Israeli Occupiers debated the options of &#145;apartheid or expulsion&#146; for
the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Their choice of apartheid was eventually
packaged and endorsed in the Oslo agreements. Palestinian rejection of the various
agreements has forced Israel to resort to military measures to ensure compliance if not
acceptance. The democratic nations are, meanwhile, sitting on the fence waiting for the
job to be completed as fast as possible and done with. But, this is neither 1948 nor 1967.
A new generation has come of age since the occupation; a generation that is not only
committed to resistance but also to the liberation of all that was illegally occupied.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;For all its worth, Western politicians can issue calls for
self-restraint and return to the negotiating table. Yet, the truth is such pleas would
never realize Palestinian independence, repatriation or sovereignty over national borders,
Jerusalem and the natural resources, or the dismantling of Jewish settlements. These
calls, moreover, would never be respected or trusted when the same powers continue to arm
Israel to the tune of billions of dollars each year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;In reality, this is a process in which some have more rights than
others. While the Jewish State has the right to use helicopter gunships and missiles
against civilian targets, it is the Palestinian duty to die peacefully. Israel can
prosecute a strategic war against the Palestinians and their neighbours while the Arabs
must scrupulously pursue the option of peace. Whereas the Israelis have the right to form
governments of national unity with extremist fundamentalists and war criminals all lumped
together; the Palestinians must dutifully perform their obligation of imprisoning their
opposition. In the same way, while heavily armed Jewish settlers from Poland, Russia,
Ethiopia and America must be afforded the right to roam, pillage and plunder, the
Palestinian sons and daughters of this land must be denied the right to build an army to
defend themselves. They must rely on stones and Molotov cocktails.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;This is the reason why the Oslo process ended in disgrace and
bankruptcy. It invested all its effort in providing security for one party while
neglecting the rights of the other. It enabled Jews from everywhere to immigrate to Israel
while it asserted the requirement that Palestinians should live in permanent exile. If the
West were waiting for a flood of refugees across the borders before they rein-in Israel,
they may have to wait indefinitely. They have created a dangerous monster without
realizing it. A monster that does not hesitate to undermine Arab interests but even the
Western democracies that support it. The issues of imprisoned spy Jonathon Pollard, the
sale of military technology to China, and the recent improprieties of U.S. Ambassador to
Israel, Martin Indyk, are only the tip of the iceberg. The deluge is nearer than it seems.</p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why Palestine?<br>
</u></b>Nato&#146;s success in ensuring the return of 810,000 Kosovar refugees from a
total of 850,000 was certainly a commendable achievement that required enormous political
will backed by military force. That it neither tolerated Serb &#147;brutality and
butchery&#148; nor allowed them to go unpunished was also laudable. So why are they
condoned in Palestine? Is it a lack of information? Or, is it a lack of moral courage to
rein-in the Jewish State that defies the will of the international community by refusing
to cooperate with a UN human rights inquiry? In the case of Kosovo, British Foreign
Secretary Cook told the House of Commons on 25 March 1999, &#147;We have seen villages
shelled, crops burned and farm animals slaughtered not for any legitimate military
purpose, but as acts of ethnic hatred.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Palestine may not be in Europe but thanks to satellite technology
the evidence of civilian homes and factories being shelled cannot be denied. Yet, here in
Palestine it is not only farm animals that are being slaughtered. Is the Honourable
Foreign Secretary not aware that children are being killed in their beds and in orchards
picking olives with their parents?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;There is today no lack of corroborating evidence that the Israeli
occupying forces and settlers continue to destroy Palestinian agricultural lands
throughout the West Bank and Gaza. Olive orchards have been bulldozed in Hossan village,
in Bethlehem, Salfit and Nablus. Banana plantations were similarly bulldozed in Jericho.
The destruction of these olive orchards and agricultural lands comes at a time when
Palestinian farmers have begun to harvest crops tended over the past year. This
constitutes a major form of income, which sustains the majority of the Palestinian
population. Is there really any difference between this systematic killing of the
Palestinian people and destruction of their economy with that obtained in the Balkans?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Surely the same international humanitarian laws and human rights
treaties that were invoked in Kosovo and East Timor should be applied here. Of course,
this is not only the failure of the British government but also the entire European Union.
They still view this as a war against Palestinian terrorism, even though the Palestinians
have suffered the most casualties throughout the past month. This really is the
consequence of policies that ensured the appointment of security advisers to the region
without ever contemplating the deployment of human rights officers to protect the victims
of Israeli terror.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;Elsewhere, in East Timor, Britain gave an undertaking that it would
be one of the six nations leading the implementation of the UN process. The democratic
world welcomed and launched the plan to establish the wishes and legitimate aspirations of
the people of East Timor on whether they wanted autonomy or full independence. The
Palestinians who have been struggling for independence since 1915 are still denied
independence even though their right to self-determination has been endorsed and upheld by
Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and numerous UN resolutions
thereafter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;If the Palestinians were seeking a status or rights not recognized
by international law, one would probably understand and excuse the attitude of Western
governments. But since they are a people whose land was invaded, conquered and occupied by
foreigners and they are only exercising their legitimate right to end that occupation, the
policies toward them appear both inexplicable and inexcusable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Everything that transpires in Palestine today smells of the dogma of a
master race and a subhuman people. One in which Jews have divine rights to rule, dominate
and abuse while Palestinians must serve as hewers of wood and drawers of water. This is a
dangerous development. In the past it landed Europe into two destructive wars that
extended far beyond its shores. Whereas in the 1980s Israel toyed with the idea of
&#145;apartheid or expulsion&#146; for the Palestinians, they adopted the worst-case
scenario of &#145;death or expulsion&#146; after the Palestinians rejected the apartheid
option packaged in Oslo. In this al-Aqsa Intifada the Palestinians have chosen the first
instead of the latter. This is the last stand. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">E. Yaghi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When 12-year-old Palestinian Mohammed spoke of how he wanted to be a
soccer champion, his black eyes flashed and he would kick an imaginary ball off to a
successful goal. His mother, busy with her six other children, would nod her head and say,
&#147;Yes, perhaps one day when you are big and stronger, you will go off to the Olympics
and win a gold medal.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Before that, Mom,&#148; he would say enthusiastically, &#147;I just
want to be the star of my school soccer team. Then I will begin to think about growing up
and the Olympics.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 30 September 2000, Mohammed&#146;s father said to him, &#147;Come on,
son. Let&#146;s go and try to sell that old Fiat. Since I&#146;ve been out of work, we
need the money to buy food and supplies.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It would be good, thought Mohammed. Good to get out and away from the
demonstrations. Good to forget that the Israelis had closed the schools. Good to forget
the curfews at night. Good to forget the Israeli bullets aimed at kids like himself during
confrontations with them. Good to have the chance to be alone with his father. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, he put on his new striped blue shirt and faded blue jeans, and ran a
comb hurriedly through the soft curls of his thick dark hair. He dashed out of his
three-room cinder-block home to join his father whose fingers fidgeted as he took long
deep puffs on the butt of his cigarette. They got in the used Fiat and drove off in a
cloud of red dust to look for a used car salesmen. As his father drove, Mohammed looked at
the sturdy hands that gripped the steering. Hands that will protect me, he thought. Slim
hands but strong. That his mother would have a nice lunch ready upon their return let a
smile creep across his small, troubled face. He tried to shut scenes of the demonstrators,
many of whom were children his own age or younger, out of his mind. Instead, he tried to
picture himself and his soccer team heading to victory on the field. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The car screeched to a halt. Father and son jumped out and the boy heard
his father say to a salesman, after some bartering, &#147;OK. It&#146;s a deal then.&#148;
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He helped his father count the money before boarding a taxi that would
take them back home to the cheerful face of his mother and the shouts and laughter of his
younger brothers and sisters. Being with them almost made him forget the fact that they
were poor and that his father lost his job and now had no means to support his family.
Looking up, he noticed his father studying him. Then the parent reached over to tousle the
boy&#146;s dark hair and with his strong protective hand, patted him on his shoulder.
&#147;It will be ok, son. Don&#146;t worry.&#148; Then, &#147;Let&#146;s go home and get
something to eat.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mohammed&#146;s mother never let him join in any demonstrations. It was
because as she said, &#147;I don&#146;t want them carrying pieces of your body home dead
to me. What will I do without you?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He would look into her gentle black eyes, so similar to his own, and find
peace and security there. She was the essence of love. She was what mothers were all
about. He was tempted to join in the struggle for freedom but heard his mother&#146;s
voice saying to him every time he went out, &#147;You are a bright boy. Everyone likes
you. Stay out of trouble and your future will be promising. You can help your people by
getting an education and by winning the gold medal in the Olympics you so admire.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So he would bury himself in a book, trying not to hear the screams, the
shouts, the bullets that flew right past his window. He would listen to his mother and use
his energy for something other than throwing stones at armoured tanks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And now, here he was with his father, waiting for the yellow taxi to take
them home. He caught sight of one not too far from where they stood and stepped out to
flag it down. It stopped and his father told the driver, &#147;to the camp.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He sat between his father and the driver. Had it not been for the clashes,
the day would have been beautiful. The relentless heat had given way to an Indian summer.
The smell of the sea was in the air and if the boy listened, he could hear the cry of
seagulls in their search for food. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unexpectedly, his body shuddered and his father put his arm around him
seeming to sense his son&#146;s apprehension of something foreboding and evil. Then it
came as sure as the day. The sound of bullets flying everywhere and the shouts of the
demonstrators. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We are surrounded. Come on, son, let&#146;s get out of the
taxi.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mohammed almost fell out. His whole body shook with fear. He felt
paralyzed, not able to move. His father half dragged him, half carried him next to a small
wall. There, crouching, he threw his son behind him, shielding him with his own thin body.
At first the boy encouragingly told his father, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, Daddy. The
ambulance will come and save us.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But then bullets flew faster and more ferociously. He tried to be brave,
but he did not want to die. Not now. Not when he was only 12. Not when he had hardly begun
to live. He screamed in fear and huddled closer to his father who he knew was desperately
trying to protect him. A hail of bullets rained down all around them. One Israeli soldier
took aim at the small frame of the boy. An ambulance rushed to the scene. The same Israeli
soldier, who shot Mohammed in the stomach, shot the ambulance driver in the head and
riddled the boy&#146;s father with bullets. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mohammed did not live to go on to play in the Olympics or even to be a
soccer star for his own elementary team at school. But his mother, left to care for his
pet finches said, &#147;He is now a star in heaven.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His death has become a symbol of freedom and the Palestinian struggle
against the Israeli occupation. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">American Zionism</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Edward Said</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent events in Palestine have been a near-total triumph for Zionism
in the United States for the first time since the modern re-emergence of the Palestinian
national movement in the late 1960s. Political as well as public discourse has so
definitively transformed Israel into the victim during the recent clashes that even though
more than 200 Palestinian lives were lost and more than 5,000 casualties have been
reported, it is still something called &#147;Palestinian violence&#148; that has disrupted
the smooth and orderly flow of the &#147;peace process.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is now a small litany of phrases that every editorial commentator
either repeats verbatim or relies on as an unspoken assumption: these have been engraved
in ears, minds and memories as a guide for the perplexed, a manual or machine for turning
out phrases that have clogged the air for at least a month. I can recite most of them by
heart: Barak offered more concessions at Camp David than any Israeli Prime Minister before
him (90% of the territories and partial sovereignty over East Jerusalem); Arafat was
cowardly and lacked the necessary courage to accept Israeli offers to end the conflict;
Palestinian violence, directed by Arafat, has threatened Israel (all sorts of variations
on this, including the wish to eliminate Israel, anti-Semitism, suicidal rage in order to
get on television, putting children in the front lines so that they would become martyrs)
and proved that an ancient &#147;hatred&#148; of the Jews motivates Palestinians; Arafat
is a weak leader who allows his people to attack Jews and incite against them by releasing
terrorists and producing schoolbooks that deny Israel&#146;s existence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are probably one or two more formulae that I have not cited, but the
general picture is that Israel is so surrounded by rock-throwing barbarians that even the
missiles, tanks and helicopter gunships that have been used to &#147;defend&#148; Israelis
from the violence are simply warding off a terrible force. Bill Clinton&#146;s injunctions
(dutifully parroted by his Secretary of State) for Palestinians to &#147;pull back&#148;
goes a long way to suggest that it is Palestinians who are encroaching on Israeli
territory, not the other way round. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is also worth mentioning that so successful has this Zionization of the
media been that not a single map has been published or shown on television to remind
American viewers and readers&#150;notoriously ignorant of both geography and
history&#150;that Israeli encampments, settlements, roads and barricades crisscross
Palestinian land in Gaza and the West Bank. Moreover, as happened in Beirut in 1982, there
is a veritable Israeli siege of Palestinians, including of Arafat and his men. Completely
forgotten, if it was ever at all understood, is the system of Areas A, B and C by which
the military occupation of 40% of Gaza and 60% of the West Bank continues, and which the
Oslo peace process was never really designed to end, much less totally modify. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As suggested by the absence of geography in this most geographical of
conflicts, the resulting void is a vitally important point since the pictures that are
either shown or described are without context at all. I think the omission by the Zionized
media was a deliberate one at the outset and has now become automatic. It has allowed
phony commentators such as Thomas Friedman to peddle his wares shamelessly, droning on
about American even-handedness, Israeli flexibility and generosity and his own
perspicacious pragmatism with which he berates Arab leaders and stuns his bored readers.
It has the result not only of permitting the completely preposterous notion of a
Palestinian attack on Israel to prevail, but it also further dehumanizes Palestinians as
being beasts without sentience or motive. Thus little wonder that when the figures of the
dead and wounded are recited, no nationalities are given: this lets Americans assume that
the suffering is equally divided between the &#147;warring parties,&#148; and in fact
elevates Jewish suffering and reduces or eliminates Arab feelings entirely, except of
course for rage. Rage and its cognates remain as the only and certainly the defining
Palestinian emotion. It explains the violence, and indeed, it reifies it so that Israel
has come to represent a decency and democracy that is forever surrounded by rage and
violence. No other process can logically explain the stone-throwers and the stalwart
Israeli &#147;defense.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nothing is said of house demolitions, land expropriations, illegal
arrests, torture and the like. Nothing is cited about what is (except for the Japanese
occupation of Korea) the longest military occupation in modern times; nothing about UN
resolutions; nothing about Israeli contraventions of all the Geneva Conventions; nothing
about the sufferings of one entire people and the obduracy of another. Forgotten are the
catastrophe of 1948, ethnic cleansing and massacres, the devastation of Qibya, Kafr
Qassem, Sabra and Shatila, the long years of military government for non-Jewish Israeli
citizens to say nothing of their continued oppression as a persecuted 20% minority within
the Jewish State. Ariel Sharon at best is a provocation, never a war criminal; Ehud Barak
a Statesman, never the assassin of Beirut. Terrorism is always on the Palestinian side of
the ledger, defense on the Israeli. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What Friedman and pro-Israeli &#147;peaceniks&#148; fail to mention when
they extol Barak&#146;s unprecedented generosity is the real substance of it. We are not
reminded that his commitment to a one-third withdrawal (of about 12%) made at Wye 18
months ago has never occurred. Of what value then are more such &#147;concessions?&#148;
We are told that he was willing to give back 90% of the territory. What gets left out is
that the 90% consists of what Israel has no intention of giving back. Greater Jerusalem is
well over 30% of the West Bank; large settlements to be annexed are another 15%; military
roads of areas have yet to be determined. So after all this is deducted, 90% of the
balance isn&#146;t so much after all. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for Jerusalem: the Israel concession was principally in being willing
to discuss and maybe, just maybe, to offer shared authority over the Haram al-Sharif. The
breathtaking dishonesty of the matter is that all of West Jerusalem (principally Arab in
1948) was already conceded by Arafat, plus most of a vastly expanded East Jerusalem. One
detail further: Palestinians&#146; firing by small arms on Gilo is routinely made to seem
like gratuitous violence, whereas no one mentions that Gilo itself sits on land
confiscated from Beit Jala, the place from which the firing emanates. Besides, Beit Jala
was disproportionately shelled by Israeli helicopters using missiles to destroy civilian
houses. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The total blanketing of the mainstream has taken place on the assumption
that no Palestinian or Arab or Islamic position on such matters as Israeli terror tactics
against civilians, settler-colonialism, or military occupation exists at all, or is worth
hearing from. This is simply without precedent in the annals of U.S. journalism, and is a
direct reflection of a Zionist mind-set that makes Israel the norm in human behaviour,
thereby excluding from equal consideration the existence of 300 million Arabs and 1.2
billion Muslims. In the long run, this is of course a suicidal position for Zionists to be
in, but such is the arrogance of power that the thought seems not to have occurred to
anyone. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mind-set I have described is truly staggering in its recklessness and,
were it not very much a practical as well as actual distortion of reality, one could quite
easily be talking about a form of private mental derangement. But it corresponds very
closely to the official Israeli policy of dealing with Palestinians not as a people with a
history of dispossession for which in large measure Israel is directly responsible, but as
a periodic nuisance for whom force, and neither understanding nor full accommodation, is
the only possible response. Everything else is literally unthinkable. This astonishing
blindness is compounded in the United States since Arabs and Muslims are scarcely paid
attention to except as (I have said in an earlier article) the butt of every aspiring
politician. Recently, Hillary Clinton announced in a gesture of the most revolting
hypocrisy that she was returning a $50,000 donation from an American-Muslim group because,
she said, they supported terrorism; this in fact was an outright lie, since the group in
question had only said that it supported Palestinian resistance against Israel during the
current crisis, not in itself an untoward position but criminalized in the American system
only because a totalitarian Zionism requires that any&#150;and I mean literally
any&#150;criticism of what Israel does is simply intolerable and the rankest
anti-Semitism. And this despite the fact that (again literally) the entire world has
criticized Israel&#146;s policies of military occupation, disproportionate violence, and
the siege of the Palestinians. In America you must refrain from any criticism, otherwise
you are hounded as an anti-Semite requiring the severest opprobrium. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fine, American Zionism has made any serious public discussion of
Israel, by far the largest-ever recipient of U.S. foreign aid, its past and its future, a
taboo not to be broken in any circumstance. To call this literally the last taboo in
American discourse is by no means an exaggeration. Abortion, homosexuality, the death
penalty, even the sacrosanct military budget have been talked about with some freedom
(although always within limits). The American flag can be burned in public, whereas the
systematic continuity of Israel&#146;s 52-year-old treatment of the Palestinians is
virtually unimaginable, a narrative with no permission to appear. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This consensus might be somehow tolerable were it not for the fact that it
makes the continuing punishment and dehumanization of the Palestinian people an actual
virtue. There is simply no people in the world today whose killing on television screens
seems to be considered by most American viewers to be acceptable as well-deserved
punishment. This is the case with Palestinians whose daily loss of life in the past month
is herded under the rubric &#147;the violence on both sides,&#148; as if the stones and
slings of young men thoroughly tired of injustice and repression were a major offence
rather than the courageous resistance to a demeaning fate meted out to them not just by
Israeli soldiers armed by America, but by a peace process designed to coop them up in
Bantustans and reservations fit for animals. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That the U.S. supporters of Israel could have plotted for seven years to
produce a document designed essentially to cage people like inmates in an asylum or
prison&#150;that is the real crime. And that this could be passed off as peace instead of
the desolation that it really has been all along, that surpasses my powers to understand
or adequately describe as anything less than untrammeled immorality. The worst thing of
all is that so iron-like is the wall protecting American discourse about Israel that no
questions can be put to the minds that produced Oslo and that for seven years have been
passing off their scheme to the world as peace. One scarcely knows which is more
pernicious, the mentality that thinks of Palestinians as not entitled even to express a
sense of injustice (they are too low a form for that) or the one that continues to plot
their further enslavement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Were this the whole it would be bad enough. But our miserable status as
far as U.S. Zionism is concerned is compounded by the absence of any institution here or
in the Arab world ready and able to produce an alternative. I fear that the coverage of
those stone-throwing protesters in Bethlehem, Gaza, Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron may not be
adequately reflected in the dithering Palestinian leadership, unable either to retire or
to go forward. That is the ultimate pity of it. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Palestine needs new leadership: <br>
Time for Arafat to abdicate</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Mohamed Khodr</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For generations, Palestinians have only known Yasser Arafat as their
leader, freedom fighter and spokesperson for their legitimate rights and aspirations for
independence and a homeland. Palestinians have placed their intellectual and emotional
trust in him to deliver them from the grasps of enslavement and persecution. Arafat has
played that role for the last 35 years. He became the wily politician survivalist who was
adept at playing Arab against Arab, Palestinian against Palestinian, Israeli against
Israeli, and confused the world over time as to his true intentions. He has logged more
travel miles than anyone in modern history while enjoying the celebrity status of a
guerilla Statesman. Since Oslo, he became more interested and arrogant in his new roles as
White House Statesman, Albright hand-holder, and popular Western media celebrity. With his
deteriorating health, time became a valuable commodity. He was determined to fulfill his
dream of being the first Palestinian President of an independent Palestinian State,
regardless of the geographic, historical, religious, economic and social framework of such
a &#147;nation.&#148; To him, the ends justified the means. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For decades he held secret meetings and contacts with Israeli officials
while keeping his people and the Arab nations in the dark. He approached Oslo
single-handedly and secretively without informing or coordinating with the Arab leaders
who have supported him for years. Oslo forced the Arab world to refashion and readjust its
political dynamics with Israel and the United States. With the death of Oslo, Arafat once
again found himself marooned in need of Arab and Islamic support. Unfortunately, his worth
and capital to his people and to the Arab leaders and masses has greatly diminished. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What does Arafat have to show for his Oslo capitulation? Over 260
Palestinians dead and approximately 8,000 wounded&#150;many disabled for life; homes blown
up by helicopter rockets and missiles; indiscriminate tank shelling of towns and villages
under siege; interrupted food, water and medical supplies; and the inhumane shelling of
ambulances carrying the wounded&#150;all over the period of less than two months.
Arafat&#146;s impulsive nature to make rash decisions goaded by his own ego and compliant
aides have sacrificed the noble Palestinian cause for Israeli and American crumbs and
Bantustans while allowing Israel to dictate the agendas of &#147;peace&#148; and
&#147;occupation&#148;. Even Masjid al-Aqsa became fodder for the Arafat-Israeli political
and public relations one-upmanship. Arafat has failed Palestine, failed himself, and
failed to dedicate, sacrifice and focus himself on the Palestinians living in squalor
refugee camps who hardly ever see or hear him. Even the Pope looked more at ease and more
sympathetic to the plight of the refugees of the Dheisheh camp than Arafat, who appeared
uncomfortable, embarrassed and more anxious to leave the squalor of &#147;his&#148;
people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After Arafat and the Pope left the camp, the refugees unleashed their
anger and frustration at their &#147;government&#148;&#146; with stones, stones usually
meant for enemies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat is responsible for the arrogant weapon-wielding and occupying PLO
force that led to disasters and more ill feeling toward the Palestinians in Jordan and
Beirut. The PLO in Beirut established a government by force imposing its will on the
hapless Lebanese. Its leaders lived in extraordinary comfort pursuing a playboy-ish
lifestyle while the health, welfare and economic standards in the refugee camps continued
to deteriorate. When the PLO was forced to leave Beirut, the only thing they left behind
for the refugees was the angry, sour distaste of the Lebanese people against them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat has done his part for Palestine but his failed politics, corrupt
government and America-pleasing attitude has only led to more funerals. He has no respect
from within or without his people. He embarrasses himself and his people whenever he
appears on American television with his egotistical pronouncements, histrionic gestures
and broken English that only serves to reinforce America&#146;s already bigoted assessment
of him. His stupid, awkward salute in front of Clinton is demeaning to him and to all
Arabs. Why salute the man who blames you for your murdered children? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat can take heart in the fact that he is not alone in his lackluster,
self-serving leadership qualities. In that regard, he joins most of the Arab and Islamic
leaders who are more content with preserving their chairs, maintaining their applauding
media, while keeping their populace hungry, poor, illiterate and threatened with jail,
death or disappearance should they raise their voices. Some Arab leaders would rather
shoot their own citizens than let any harm come to the Israeli or American embassies.
However, as a result of a few days of protest from their masses, the best the Arab Summit
could do was buy time with a $1-billion-bribe to bury the martyr&#146;s and silence their
cries for freedom. Arafat to his eternal shame accepted the money and the bribe to
continue his doomed &#147;Oslo&#148; path littered with apartheid promises and daily
funerals. Not to be outdone, Clinton immediately sent Congress a request for $480 million
in emergency military aid for Israel to replenish the weapons and bullets lost in the
organs of Palestine&#146;s youth. In effect, America pays for the murders while the Arabs
pay for the funerals. No one it seems is concerned with the living and their hopes and
dreams for a breath of life and freedom in Palestine. To paraphrase Abba Eban&#146;s
famous phrase: &#147;<b>The Arab, American and Israeli leaders never miss an opportunity
to miss a Palestinian.&#148;</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">OSLO IS DEAD AND ARAFAT MUST GO. Arafat has outlived his usefulness. The
&#147;peace of the brave&#148; has become &#147;the peace of the grave.&#148; The
Palestinians must democratically elect new leaders with a new vision, new energy and new
political and economic strategies. A war of attrition will only deprive Palestine of its
future. Only a coordinated Arab Islamic and Christian effort supplanted by a willingness
to sacrifice political and economic relations based on UN resolutions 242 and 338 will
ultimately succeed. Arab Christians have been forgotten in this conflict, yet their
suffering at Israel&#146;s hands is just as serious. Their participation is vital and
needed to influence Western public opinion. The strategy must be developed soon
emphasizing a massive public relations campaign worldwide to take advantage of a new
American President&#146;s honeymoon, especially if George W. Bush is elected. An
international protective force for Palestinians seems the rational first strategy that a
new American President can support without expending too much Jewish capital. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians must elect new leaders dedicated to their people, not their
wallets, leaders educated and sophisticated enough in politics, economics and Western
culture, leaders with experience in the modern media with excellent command of English,
leaders who above all will have the support and commitment of their people; leaders who
can reach the minds and hearts of the American taxpayer, who only knows the Palestinians
as terrorists and sends his hard-earned tax dollars to Israel to kill children; leaders
who understand Zionism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam and can speak effectively on such
topics; leaders who can come to American churches, synagogues, and mosques and deliver a
moving message of hope and peace; leaders unafraid to speak directly to the American
people with truth, passion and compassion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A forceful, revolutionary and bold move would be to elect Dr. Hanan
Ashrawi as President of the Palestinian Authority. Western politicians and the media will
have finally met their match. An elegant, eloquent, highly educated Christian woman with a
respected international reputation and good relations with Israeli citizens, an educator
already known in the U.S. who above all knows what it is to hold shot Palestinian youth in
her arms. If elected, Palestinian Muslims must support Dr. Ashrawi to show the world
Islam&#146;s inclusiveness, respect, and support for a Christian woman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After 52 years of despair, painful suffering and failed Arab support,
Palestinians recognize that their struggle against Israel depends more on their own will,
hard work, intelligence and sacrifice than on the support from a lost, divided,
demoralized Arab and Islamic world. Within weeks of the Arab League&#146;s deplorable
summit hastily arranged by America&#146;s Mubarak to appease the marching masses, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference&#146;s (OIC&#146;s) meeting in Qatar was an even
greater failure. As Muslims, we have long tolerated our un-Islamic leaders who fear us
more than they fear Islam&#146;s enemies. Their military and police are used against us
lest we awaken and demand a life of faith, hope and prosperity. The protection of their
chairs is more important than the protection of the blood that spilled from Muslim
children in Palestine. Our leaders lack religious or democratic legitimacy from their
people thus they are more comfortable in importing labour and dealing with Western banks,
governments and institutions than they are in supporting their Muslim brothers and
sisters. It isn&#146;t a lack of resources but a lack of will both among our peoples and
our leaders. As long as Arabs and Muslims accept the status quo with an irrational
subservience to authority, we deserve our rulers and our destiny. Our rulers, following
Western propaganda, have instilled in our youth an almost knee-jerk rejection of Islam as
a faith detrimental to democracy and progress. Ironically, in the West, people are
searching for a spiritual life while we are abandoning ours. There is nothing in Islam
that prevents or prohibits any nation from achieving its ultimate potential in any field.
It is only autocratic rulers who seek to keep their people subjugated and ignorant who
fear the liberation and justice of Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Democracy, pluralism, respect for human rights, justice and tolerance are
the hallmarks of Islam. Despite America&#146;s lip service to supporting democracies,
America will always oppose democratically elected Islamists in any Islamic nation, as is
the case in Turkey, Algeria and Egypt. America recognizes that a nation steeped in Islamic
law, religion and tradition will not submit to its political, economic, military and
cultural hegemony.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How should we proceed as Arabs, Christians and Muslims? A totally revamped
political strategy is needed by the Arab and Islamic nations that emphasizes international
legitimacy, human rights, justice, peaceful coexistence, a nuclear-free Middle East,
economic cooperation and prosperity. A well funded, organized public relations campaign
aimed at Western public opinion, especially in the United States, is needed to influence
Western leaders and counter the Zionist propaganda that has done more harm to the
Palestinian cause and Islam than any military victory. Perhaps the launching of a new
Islamic satellite channel to enlighten the West with images and words of the cost and
consequences of their blind support of Israel . A carrot and stick strategy has been
effective for the Zionists; it can be effective for the Islamic world. Make no mistake
that the Palestinian conflict is the fulcrum of the larger East and West conflict. As far
as Palestine goes, so goes the East-West relationship. We must face our demons and our
internal truths and build upon our faith, and Allah (SWT) will make us victorious. We have
seen our enemy and the enemy is us. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tragically, time is needed to awaken our masses to the culpability of our
leaders in squandering our lives and resources for selfish, secular reasons under the
guise of a &#147;pseudo-intellectual&#148; revolution toward progress and modernity. Our
Ummah will continue to pray in fear, silence and intimidation. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Israel may militarily win the security argument but will lose the
long-term peace it seeks while America may win the peace for Israel but lose its long-term
security and national interests in the region and the Islamic world. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Language of Politics</font></b></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Fatima Hamilton</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<em>Have you ever stopped to think why you believe the way you do or
why you hold certain political views? What things influence or persuade you? What touches
your heart or mind? What motivates you or what does it take to deactivate you and detach
you from politics and from life? </em></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>We are all a product of where we were born and raised as well as
where we studied. One great influence over many of us is the television. It sits in the
middle of our homes and gives us its view of world events. So, we daily &#147;eat&#148;
from its words and images and believe it&#150;whether it is true or not. We must become
better viewers. We must analyse the news and learn to read between the lines in order to
get to the truth. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The West, especially the United States, is the most advanced in the
use of political language. They can give us the facts and twist it by their language to
give us the opposite meaning. The Arab countries and other third world countries are also
beginning to do the same thing. They were colonized by Western powers, who physically left
but who had already planted a seed to teach the Arabs, Africans and others to conform to
Western thoughts. What better way to defeat your enemy than to make him think as you do,
to make him &#147;love&#148; you and to make him &#147;think&#148; he is equal to you? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The West has not completely accomplished this yet, but they are in the
process. Many Arab regimes think in Western and secularized ways and obey their Western
&#147;Masters&#148; for fear of losing money and power. The common people have been led to
believe that they must immigrate to America&#150;the land of milk and honey. Many think
they must dress, speak and think like Americans in order to be advanced and to gain money
and &#147;respect.&#148; Yet, they don&#146;t realize they&#146;ll never get
America&#146;s respect. Racist America only loves white, Christian, wealthy people (and
those who are without religion or morals). Yet, the dream continues as America and the
West perpetuate this dream through certain language and certain media images. This is how
they control their own people as well. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As far as our conditioning, even as children we were taught in school how
to think (or rather how not to think and not to question). We accepted the terminology and
images our schools and governments gave us, particularly in the West. Certain phrases or
words bring strong images into our minds. For example, when most of us hear the word
&#147;mother&#148;, we usually think of a caring, loving, sweet woman who took care of us
when we were young. (There are a few who may have a different image owing to personal
problems, but the above definition holds true for the majority of us.) When we hear the
word &#147;police&#148;, we think of authority. When we hear the word
&#147;terrorist&#148;, we think of a violent criminal holding a gun or bomb and we fear
him. (We never stop to think that maybe the man is a freedom fighter or that he had a
reason for what he did. Yes, some may be real terrorists, but some may also be freedom
fighters. Yet, when we hear the label &#147;terrorist&#148;, we already have him
condemned.) </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These images are in our minds, and government officials and news media tap
into these definitions by cleverly arranging their speeches and reports. So, they may give
some facts (not always all the facts) and use terms that will bring us the image they want
to get across, either to convince us to support government decisions and actions or to
keep up media &#147;hype&#148; to increase sales or to help us to support whoever they may
support. It doesn&#146;t always work, but in most cases it does. That is why I say most
Americans, and even Europeans, are politically naïve. Even in some cases, they are taught
not to get too involved in politics though it has a great impact on their lives and
futures. They are led to believe it is boring or doesn&#146;t concern them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When government officials and news reporters speak about violent clashes
in the Middle East, they may call a man who is fighting for his freedom and who is
defending his home and land a &#147;terrorist&#148; or a &#147;suicide bomber&#148; rather
than a freedom fighter. When they want to describe a &#147;terrorist&#148;, they may call
him an &#147;Islamic Fundamentalist.&#148; Fundamentalist, in its original meaning has a
good meaning, but after awhile, they have changed its meaning and tried to convince us
that it is something horrible and even a crime to be a fundamentalist. These are just a
few examples of word usage. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Despite all of these language games, we can get the truth if we
read between these words and phrases. We find Clinton, Barak and the United Nations all
spouting the same peace rhetoric&#150;the same words and phrases; they must have studied
the same booklet. Even Yasser Arafat and his group are caught up in the same words and
rhetoric. Arafat, the Palestinian people and the whole world should realize there is no
real &#147;peace process&#148;. It is an imaginary process on paper that has been used to
subdue the people. The Israelis do not really want peace. They want peace only for
themselves. They do not want to give us any of our land. They are playing with us and
buying time. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Several Israeli officials and even Israeli citizens have stated
that &#147;the Palestinians must learn to live in peace with us.&#148; And they have said,
&#147;We have to live together.&#148; What does this mean? Why do we have to live
together? The Israelis live in their State and the Palestinians live in their State. We
are supposed to get our State. Yet, where is it? They do not plan to ever let us get a
State. They continue settlement building to increase their population in Palestinian areas
in order to stake claim to the land. In the future, they will claim they can&#146;t give
up this area or that area because it has Israelis living on it. Then in the end, they will
tell the Palestinians that they must live as Arab-Israelis in a State of Israel, if they
want peace. Israel will completely take our land and the world will watch or even help as
the UN did in 1948. When will Arabs and Muslims wake up and see this fact? </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Allah has described for us the character of all Jews in the
Qur&#146;an, and we have known them throughout history, so we should understand their
treachery. They have not changed. Maybe they&#146;ve gotten worse. How can we believe they
want peace when we&#146;ve achieved hardly anything in seven years? How can we believe
they want peace while they are killing our children and destroying our homes? </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Barak stated that the Palestinians are good at playing the role of
the &#147;victim.&#148; Well, we are the victim! Who has mostly died in recent clashes?
Palestinians. Who has the tanks, planes, missiles, guns, etc.? The Israelis. So, it should
be clear by logic and by pictures on the news, i.e. Mohammed Al-Durra, seen by the world. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>When will the world wake up and break out of their conditioning?
When will they learn to think for themselves? When will they learn to understand the
language of politics, or rather its lies? </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">It&#146;s bed time son, not death time</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Samir Rantissi</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My three and a half year old son Amir quickly threw his arms around my
legs and clung to me as he burst into a hysterical cry with the sound of the first
explosion that very much sounded like the shell had fallen into our backyard. It happened
around 7 p.m. last night (22 November). Our house is located in Ramallah&#146;s
neighbourhood of Sateh Marhaba, which is less than half a kilometre away from where
Israeli tanks and heavy machine guns practice their daily live drills against our
neighbourhood from the settlement of Pisagot. My wife, Suha, looking extremely shaken by
the explosions, ushered Amir to me to hold and hug him. She was carrying at the same time
his shocked but silent twin sister, Sama, who always prefers to keep her emotions inside
whenever she is extremly frightened. I hugged Amir, kissed him, and whispered in his ear,
&#147;Don&#146;t be afraid; it&#146;s only the sound of thunder.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But my words went unheard in little Amir&#146;s ears. As he strongly clung
his arms around my neck, he buried his head in my chest and his loud cry turned slowly,
slowly into a frightened weeping voice. Again and again, I kept telling him the same words
and explaining to him, &#147;It is the winter season, and you know, in winter and before
it rains, we see lightening in the sky, and then we hear loud thunder, but it really
doesn&#146;t hurt us; in fact, it is good for us, because after the lightening and the
thunder comes the rain, and it provides us with drinking and bathing water, and it makes
trees blossom.:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My little Amir suddenely stopped weeping, looked at me with tearful eyes
and said, &#147;I don&#146;t like winter.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I answered, &#147;Why? It&#146;s good for us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He looked at me again and said, &#147;If it&#146;s good for us, why does
it make all those horrible sounds and frighten us?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For a moment I didn&#146;t know how to answer. I was searching for some
logical argument, but he didn&#146;t even allow me to continue my search as his soft voice
mixed with his weeping cut through my thinking as he said, &#147;Daddy, you tell me that a
liar goes to hell. I don&#146;t want you to go to hell. That is not thunder, Daddy, that
is a <i>saroukh</i> (rocket). <i>Al-Yahudi</i> (the Jews) shell us. I know, my friend
Mahdi at school says that the Jews shell us with rockets every night. Yesterday, my other
friend Anwar said at school that his brother Hammoudeh was shot by the Jews. He said that
his face was full of blood, and then they carried him on a bed [meaning a coffin] and took
him away.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I found myself asking him, &#147;Where did they take him to?&#148;</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My little Amir answered as he cried louder, &#147;They took him to where
he dies.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He buried his face again in my chest and shouted as he continued crying
and weeping, &#147;I don&#146;t like to die, Daddy, I don&#146;t like to die...&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Later in the night, as the shells and heavy machine gun fire kept us all
very sober, I tried to put Amir to bed so he could get some rest. He strongly kept
resisting my efforts to put him in his bed. When I asked why he didn&#146;t want to sleep
in his bed as he usually does, his answer was, &#147;I am afraid; they will come and carry
me and take me to where I die, like Hammoudeh.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I took my little Amir to my bed and let him sleep next to me. As he closed
his eyes and started drifting into a deep sleep, I found myself telling him, &#147;Sleep,
my little one, sleep, have sweet dreams; it&#146;s bed time here, I just hope that death
time goes away, very far away, before you grow up into your youthful years!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The National Religious Party and the Religious
Settlers</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The final innovation of Rabbi Kook the elder contributed most decisively
to the popularity and political influence of his early followers and subsequently of Gush
Emunim. During the period of redemption this innovation affected the conduct of the elect
in relation to worldly concerns and contacts with other Jews and non-Jews. Rabbi Kook
taught that the elect should not stand aloof from the rest of the world, as Jews had often
done in the past. Realizing that other people were sinful and even satanic in nature, the
elect had to attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and the others by actively
involving themselves in society. Only by so doing would the elect have any chance to
sanctify others. The elect should provide an example, exert influence politically and
increasingly make contact with other people. Since the 1920s this doctrine has greatly
influenced the behavior of those affiliated with the NRP. After being established in 1974,
Gush Emunim vigorously reasserted this doctrine in spite of great resentment of the
public. Unlike Orthodox Jews previously, Rabbi Kook's followers began to dress like
secular Jews and only distinguished themselves outwardly by wearing skullcaps. To date
they have followed the Israeli secular clothing fashions of the 1950s. In their schools
they introduced portions of secular teaching into their curricula. They permitted their
people to enroll in Israeli secular universities. They additionally established the
religiously oriented Bar-Ilan University. Although restricting the Bar-Ilan teaching staff
to religious Jews, Gush Emunim sought to expand the university's scope of instruction to
include all the usual academic disciplines. The Haredim have consistently resented and
viewed with abhorrence these pursuits of what they regard as secularization. Rabbi Kook
insisted that each Jew had a religious duty to fight and to train to fight. NRP members
have faithfully followed this teaching. Many Gush Emunim members have been and still are
officers of the Israeli army's select units; their proportion in such units has
continually increased. Gush Emunim religious school students have gained renown for their
excellent combat qualities, their high motivation to fight, their relatively high casualty
rate during the Lebanon war and their willingness to beat up Palestinians during the
Intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gush Emunim has won broad public sympathy in Israeli Jewish society
because of its attitude towards army service. This contrasts sharply with the societal
antagonism directed against the Haredim for their dodging of military service. The
doctrine of sanctity, attributed by the two Rabbi Kooks to almost every Zionist
enterprise, contributed even more to the widespread public sympathy for and support of
Gush Emunim. Tal contrasted the religious Zionist outlook of Rabbi Kook the younger and
Gush Emunim with that of the secular left. Tal defined the secular left's Zionist outlook
as a &quot;poetic, lyrical notion, according to which the return to the soil, life within
nature, the agricultural achievements, the secular creativity [are essential pans].&quot;
The two Rabbi Kooks, while acknowledging that the secular left's notion unwillingly served
the coming of messianic redemption, emphasized &quot;the military victories upon holy soil
and the Jewish blood spilled on this soil.&quot; Rabbi Kook the younger, together with
other Gush Emunim leaders, went further, according to Tal, by defining &quot;the State of
Israel as the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Israel as the kingdom of heaven on
earth.&quot; Followers of Rabbi Kook still refer to Israel as the &quot;earthly support of
the Lord's throne.&quot; Israel Harel, one of the most important Gush Emunim leaders, used
this expression to make a political point in his weekly column in <i>Haaretz </i>on
September 12, 1996. Quoting an early essay by Rabbi Kook the elder, Harel wrote that the
State of Israel was &quot;the base of the Lord's throne in this world&quot; and thus is
and should be completely different from states &quot;considered by Locke, Rosseau and
others.&quot; For such people as Harel, total holiness envelops and justifies everything
Israel does within the context of divinely inspired guidance. Tal wrote that from this
vantage point &quot;every action, every phenomenon, including secularism, will one day be
engulfed by sacredness, by redemption.&quot; It is not inconceivable that this type of
sacredness could lead to the exploding of nuclear bombs in order to end the power of Satan
and to establish &quot;the base of the Lord's throne in this world.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In many respects Gush Emunim members and the majority of NRP supporters
have continued to resemble the early Zionist pioneers. This fact has boosted their public
image. They have helped to promote this image by presenting themselves to the uninitiated
as successors of the pioneers of the 1920s and 1930s who are still cherished in the Jewish
national memory and lauded in Israeli education. As previously indicated, Gush Emunim
members, except for their miniscule skullcaps, continue consciously to emulate the dress
and mannerisms of the early pioneers. The almost exclusively Ashkenazi background of both
the early pioneers and the Gush Emunim settlers help this emulation. All Gush Erriunim
rabbis are Ashkenazi. The accepted Israeli standards of religious education, discussed in
Chapter 3, are largely responsible for the absence of Oriental Jews among Gush Emunim
rabbis. Although unwillingly to join, many Oriental Jews have supported and continue to
support Gush Emunim. The Likud constituency has to date consistently supported Gush
Emunim. By contrast, most members of the Labor Party supported Gush Emunim until the end
of the 1970s but changed after Gush Emunim opposed the peace treaty with Egypt and
demanded that Lebanon be annexed &quot;as a part of the heritage of our ancestors, the
tribes of Asher, Naphtali and Zebulun.&quot; Gush Emunim infuriated many Labor supporters
by continuing to advocate other extreme hawkish policies and by fiercely opposing Sharon's
1982 alliance with the Lebanese Falangists, who were Christians and therefore considered
to be idolaters. Gush Emunim's position in 1982 was that Jews in their battles and
conquests should only rely upon God's help. Any alliances with non-Jews could incur God's
wrath and lead to His withholding help. Such ideas were, even for extreme Labor Party
hawks, unacceptable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gush Emunim and NRP politics must be understood within the context of
ideology. The ideology makes clear what members of these groups wish to accomplish. Books
written in English have unfortunately failed to discuss adequately this ideology.
Lustick's book, <i>For the Land and the Lord, </i>which discusses Gush Emunim&#146;s
outward political behavior, is the prime example. Lustick relied to a great extent upon
the writings of Harold Fisch for his analysis of Gush Emunim's political ideology. Fisch,
a professor of English literature who seemingly has only limited competence in the Talmud
and Cabbala, has mostly written for English-speaking readers and has primarily
concentrated upon Christian fundamentalists in the United States. Lustick also relied
somewhat upon the writings of Rabbi Menachem Kasher. Kasher was a highly respected
talmudic scholar who wrote in Hebrew and influenced potential Gush Emunim initiates. His
messianic tracts are well-known to many Gush Emunim and Yeshiva students. Lustick only
briefly quoted Kasher twice and then obfuscated what he did quote. In our book we have
relied more upon what Kasher wrote and have additionally utilized other Gush Emunim
literature.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gush Emunim activists live in a homogeneous West Bank society that they
control. This society is mostly protected against &quot;contamination&quot; by rival
detested ideologies, especially those that stem from Western culture and have been to some
extent influenced the secular part of Israeli Jewish society. The possibility clearly
exists that the Gush Emunim homogeneous society and its NRP supporters can increase their
political power and influence within Israeli society. The ideology of the two Rabbis Kook
is the determining force of NRP and Gush Emunim political action. The fundamental
political tenet of Gush Emunim is that the Jewish people are unique. Gush Emunim members
share this tenet with all Orthodox Jews, but they interpret it somewhat differently.
Lustick discussed this tenet by focusing upon the Gush Emunim denial of one classical
secular Zionist theme. Lustick correctly pinpointed the two assumptions of this theme, the
first being that &quot;Jewish life had been distorted on both the individual and the
collective levels by the abnormality of diaspora existence.&quot; Second, only by
undergoing a &quot;process of normalization,&quot; by emigrating to Palestine and by
forming a Jewish state can Jews become a normal nation. Quoting Fisch, Lustick stated that
for Gush Emunim this classical idea &quot;is the original delusion of the secular
Zionists.&quot; The Gush Emunim argument is that secular Zionists measured that
&quot;normality&quot; by applying non-Jewish standards that are satanic. The secular
Zionists focused upon certain nations that they considered &quot;normal&quot; and asserted
that the non-Jews in these normal nations were more advanced than were most diaspora Jews.
Because of this, so argued the secular Zionists, Jews should try to emulate those non-Jews
by becoming a &quot;normal&quot; people in a &quot;normal&quot; nation state. The Gush
Emunim counter argument is: &quot;Jews are not and cannot be a normal people. Their
eternal uniqueness ... [is] the result of the covenant God made with them at Mount
Sinai.&quot; Lustick further explained this Gush Emunim position by quoting one of the
group's leaders, Rabbi Aviner: &quot;'While God requires other normal nations to abide by
abstract codes of justice and righteousness, such laws do not apply to Jews.&quot;' Haredi
rabbis often cited this idea in their writings, but they strictly reserved its glaring
consequences for the yet-to-come messianic age. The Halacha supports this reservation by
carefully distinguishing between two situations in discussing codes of justice and
righteousness. The Halacha permits Jews to rob non-Jews in those locales wherein Jews are
stronger than non-Jews. The Halacha prohibits Jews from robbing non-Jews in those locales
wherein the non-Jews are stronger. Gush Emunim dispenses with such traditional precautions
by claiming that Jews, at least those in Israel and the Occupied Territories, are already
living in the beginning of the messianic age.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lustick failed to explain adequately the messianic age considerations and
the distinctions between Jews and non-Jews. Harkabi's treatment was better. In discussing
the halachic teaching and the Gush Emunim position regarding murders, Harkabi explained
that the murder of a Jew, particularly when committed by a non-Jews, is in Jewish law the
worst possible crime. He then quoted the Gush Emunim leader, Rabbi Israel Ariel. Relying
upon the Code of Maimonides and the Halacha, Rabbi Ariel stated: &quot;A Jew who killed a
non-Jew is exempt from human judgment and has not violated the [religious] prohibition of
murder.&quot; Harkabi noted further that this should be remembered when &quot;the demand
is voiced that all non-Jewish residents of the Jewish state be dealt with according to
halachic regulations.&quot; Gush Emunim rabbis have continually reiterated that Jews who
killed Arabs should not be punished. Gush Emunim members not only help such Jews who are
punished by Israel's secular courts but also refuse to call those Jews
&quot;murderers.&quot; It logically follows that the religious settlers and their
followers emphasize the &quot;shedding of Jewish blood&quot; but show little concern about
the &quot;shedding of non-Jewish blood.&quot; The Gush Emunim influence on Israeli
policies can be measured by the fact that the Israeli government's policy on this matter
has clearly reflected the Gush Emunim position. The Israeli government under both Labor
and Likud leadership has refused to free Palestinian prisoners &quot;with Jewish blood on
their hands&quot; but has not hesitated to free prisoners &quot;with non-Jewish blood on
their hands.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another practical consequence of such attitudes is Gush Emunim's impact
upon the conduct of the Israeli government in all matters concerning the territories. Gush
Emunim continues to encourage Israeli authorities to deal cruelly with Palestinians in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The refusals of Prime Ministers Rabin, Peres and Netanyahu
to advocate the evacuation of even a single Jewish settlement is attributable primarily to
the influence of Gush Emunim. Gush Emunim's influence upon all Israeli governments and
political leaders of varying political persuasions has been significant.</p>
