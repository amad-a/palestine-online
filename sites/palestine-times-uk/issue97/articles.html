<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Anger By Remote Control</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Mahmoud al Khatib</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The &#147;Day of Anger&#148;, which was organized last month by the
Palestinian Authority in protest against the Zionist settlement, was a failure. The
Palestinian Street did not react to it enthusiastically, and the demonstrations were
scattered in a small number of villages. There were no confrontations with the Occupation
troops in the way the PA wanted. In short, the Palestinian protests were not in proportion
with the Zionist crimes for which the &#147;anger&#148; was ignited. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat&#146;s Authority committed a mistake when it dealt with the
Palestinian People as a &#147;robot&#148; that can be moved and stirred with a remote
control. For the anger and exasperation, which are spontaneous human feelings, against the
Jewish settlement policies cannot be ignited in the morning and cooled off in the evening
through a decision signed by the PA Chairman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The failure of the PA&#146;s &#147;Day of Anger&#148; was discussed during
the meeting of the Revolutionary Council of Fateh, the main PLO faction. Members of the
Council considered this failure as a popular stand against the PA, not the Jewish
settlement itself. The Palestinians are no longer trusting an authority that wants to make
use of their national sentiments to serve its narrow interests in talks with the Zionist
government. As some Palestinians put it, &#147;The masses cannot cooperate and respond to
a corrupt authority, which colludes with Israel at night and asks its people to take to
the streets protesting against Israel in the morning!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish settlement policy has continued and escalated since the first
day of the occupation of the Palestinian land. It has not stopped with the signing of the
Oslo accords. On the contrary, the settlement activities reached their peak after signing
the Wye River agreement last October. Sources say that more than 20 Jewish settlements
have been built in the West Bank since that date. The Oslo accords and the five-year
transitional period were understood by the Israelis as an invaluable chance to swallow
whatever they want from the Palestinian land in order to create new facts on the ground
before the final status negotiations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Likud and the Labour are playing integrated powers in this regard. The
construction of settlements and the confiscation of Palestinian lands have not been halted
with the changing of the Zionist governments. In fact, Benyamin Netanyahu (Bibi) came to
complete settlements that Rabin and Peres started. Barak has also announced that he would
not stop the settlement projects started by Netanyahu, although he is not going to approve
the construction of new settlements in the West Bank. Before Barak takes power,
Netanyahu&#146;s government allocated an additional budget of $12 million for different
settlement projects in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak is not so different than the arrogant Netanyahu. He warned Arafat
after the &#147;Day of Anger&#148; that he would not implement the Wye River agreement if
the Palestinians did not keep silent. Barak&#146;s attitude goes in harmony with his
declared platform. It is also no different than the guidelines of the coming coalition
government, which, according to Israeli reports, are based on several principles:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- The peace agreements with the Palestinians and other Arab parties should
be based on the vital security interests of the Jewish State;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- The acceleration of the peace process towards the final agreement with
the Palestinians, which will be subject to a referendum. This means that the Israelis will
force the PA to overstep the Wye River agreement, which was not implemented by
Netanyahu&#146;s government, and to immediately start the final status talks although the
Zionist occupation has not completed the redeployment of its troops in the West Bank
according to the timetable agreed upon in the Wye River agreement;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- Jerusalem will remain a &#147;united and eternal&#148; capital of the
Jewish State;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">- No new settlements will be built until the two parties reach an
agreement on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza. Also, the present situation of
the settlements will not be changed. The Israeli government &#147;will meet the demands of
the existing settlements,&#148; which means that Barak will continue supporting the
present settlement activities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority continues to receive slaps in the face without
showing any sign that it has begun to understand the Israeli mentality. Contrary to the
result of last May elections, Barak gained only 48% of the Jewish votes against 52%
obtained by Netanyahu. This means that Barak won thanks to the votes of the Arabs who live
in the 1948-occupied Palestine. Reports say that 95% of Arab votes went to Barak (about a
half million votes). The great lesson that should be absorbed by the PA is that the
Israeli community has been tending towards extremism and the Right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite that, the PA&#146;s joy with Barak&#146;s coming was suppressed
from the beginning when Barak made a number of statements regarding the peace process with
the PA, which showed that he was not anyone but &#147;Bibi&#146;s twin&#148;! This put the
PA in a critical position. On the one hand, Barak was a disappointment although the PA
marketed him among the Arab electors urging them to vote for him. On the other hand, the
PA has become aware of the fact that it is unable to gather the Palestinians round it and
to restore its popularity among its people, which was proven at the Day of Anger!</p>

<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Many observers consider Musa Abu Marzuk one of
the most shrewdest and wisest Palestinian Islamist politicians. Last month, the
Palestinian journalist Tawfik Abu Bakr interviewed Abu Marzuk in Amman. The following are
excerpts from the interview. <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(10,122) (112,142) {Abu Marzuk} {Times New Roman} 10 B #008040 CT 0  " src="abumarzouk.gif" alt="abumarzouk.gif (28723 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" u-originalsrc="abumarzouk.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_abumarzouk.gif" width="122" height="145" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: What is your evaluation of the political transformation in
Israel which brought Barak to the helm of power in the Jewish State?<br>
<b>Answer</b>: I believe there is a great deal of exaggeration about the significance of
the outcome of the Israeli election. We know that the two biggest parties in the Zionist
regime have been alternating power over the last 20 years. Before 1977, the Labor party
ruled Israel unceasingly since 1948. So there is nothing unusual about the Labor Party
coming to power again. Then, there is not a difference of substance between Ehud Barak and
Netanyahu, and when we thoroughly examine Barak's ideas, we find out that they are very
much similar to those of Netanyahu. These media may sometimes project his ideas
differently, but in reality there is no inherent or intrinsic difference between Barak and
Netanyahu.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What do you think brought about the downfall of Netanyahu? <br>
<b>A</b>: What brought down Netanyahu was the fragility of the Netanyahu coalition
government and the nature of political coalitions in the Israeli arena, which has too many
parties. There is another factor, though, and that is the United States, which contributed
to the downfall of Netanyahu.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: How did this come about? <br>
<b>A</b>: The U.S. helped the Labor Party disintegrate the Likud Party by convincing David
Levy first, and then Yitshak Mordechai and other former Likudists, who later formed the
Centre Party.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do you see a way out of the Oslo impasse? <br>
<b>A</b>: The way out is by declaring the failure of Oslo; it is by appearing before the
people and announcing that &quot;I signed the Oslo Accords for the interest of my people,
and for the interest of my people I abandon these accords.&quot; Then the Palestinian
people would be reunited.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: But the termination of the Oslo Accords would only makes us revert
to the pre-Oslo situation and would result in dismantling PA institutions and drive around
a quarter of a million Palestinians out of Palestine.<br>
<b>A</b>: Things are not that simple. Who could oust 150,000 or more who returned to their
homes? If they are truly freedom-fighters, let them wield their guns and resume armed
struggle anew.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: They can't be ousted in one day, but there are many ways they can
be harassed and forced into leaving.<br>
<b>A</b>: If those returnees are not selfish hangers-on looking after their narrow
interests, let them become true strugglers, then Oslo would become an Israeli demand.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What about the currents in Hamas now? <br>
<b>A</b>: There is a trend in Hamas to be more moderate and pragmatic, and this is
represented by the home-front leaders who are suffering the Israeli occupation. This trend
found expression in Hamas participation in the Central Council meetings in Gaza in April.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What else? <br>
<b>A</b>: Hamas has not carried out any military operations for some time now, and this, I
suppose, contributed to the downfall of Netanyahu.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Is this attributed to a new way of thinking in Hamas or to PA
pressure? <br>
<b>A</b>: Hamas has not frozen military action, and armed struggle is still Hamas' way, a
way that is not accepted either regionally or internationally. Hamas hasn't changed, and
the moment Hamas abandons armed struggle, it will not be Hamas; it will be some other
movement.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Will Hamas join PLO institutions? <br>
<b>A</b>: What institutions? The PLO doesn't have true institutions warranting serious
discussion of the matter. Where is the role of the National Council (PNC) or the Central
Council (PCC) or the Palestinian National Fund (PNF)? All these bodies are now in the
service of the authority. Even Fatah itself has been turned into a tool in the service of
the PA. Unfortunately, these bodies and so-called institutions don't meet unless Israel
and the United States call for such meetings. No serious nationalist in Hamas or other
organizations take part in these bodies which noted Palestinian figures have abandoned.
Hamas adopts armed resistance against the Zionist occupation, and this is incompatible
with the stance of the PLO.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What did the PA do to Hamas? <br>
<b>A</b>: If the PA were to stop pressuring and persecuting Hamas, it would come to an end
tomorrow. We all know that the mission of the PA is to protect the &quot;agreements.&quot;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Propping up the Basic Law in London&#146;s
Underground</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obsolete, defunct, null and void; this is how Israel&#146;s propaganda
machine describes UN resolution 181 of 1947. With general elections now decided, the
Jewish State is intensifying its media blitz on Western cities. From Los Angeles through
Chicago to London, the message is the same: There must be no return to the 1947
resolution. Faced with the challenge of securing a final settlement with the Palestinians
before the new millennium, Israelis of every political persuasion remain virtually haunted
by the past. As the race against time gathers momentum, there are, evidently, only two
options left. Either the settler colony rectifies the wrongdoings of 1947, or confronts an
unknown future with the burden it incurred from dispossessing the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Judging from the tone and content of the current media offensive it is
clear that the Israelis will choose the latter option. Those who wishfully thought that
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak would bring a new approach to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict were given a shocking indication of what lies ahead. Speaking in the
characteristic language of disdain, threats and belligerence, he issued within hours of
his election his famous &#147;Four Nos&#148;: No to the division of Jerusalem; no to a
withdrawal to the boundaries of 1967; no to the dismantling of the settlements; and no to
the creation of a Palestinian army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although all four conditions negate established Palestinian national
objectives, the first is, undoubtedly, the only one upon which the future peace and
stability of the entire Middle East rests. No other issue apart from that of the refugees
can evoke as much passion both locally and regionally as that of Jerusalem. Palestinian
resistance to Netanyahu&#146;s provocations during the 1996 tunnel affair and the 1999
Orient House crisis are both pertinent reminders of how critically important this city is.
Israel&#146;s ongoing campaign against the validity of resolution 181 must therefore be
seen not simply as an attempt to determine the nature and size of the future Palestinian
State but also as one to legitimize its occupation of Jerusalem. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Basic Law</b></u><br>
In hindsight, the Partition Resolution [181] made absolutely no statutory provisions for
Israeli sovereignty over west Jerusalem. This, quite sadly, is a fact that is overlooked
much too often by opinion and policy makers alike. The failure of the 1948 and 1967
annexations of west and east Jerusalem respectively to gain legitimacy has always been a
source of unease for the Jewish State. Hence, it resorted to the familiar practice of
creating its own legitimacy by enacting in July 1980 the Basic Law, which presumed that a
&#147;complete and united Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&#133;&#148; In effect, this
measure was no different from the Law of Return (1950) that was enforced to facilitate
Jewish immigration and simultaneously prevent the return of the Palestinian refugees.
Neither was it any different from the Law of Absentee Property (1950), which provided
legal cover for the expropriation of millions of acres of Palestinian land not provided
for by resolution 181. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the popular arguments put forward by the Israelis against the
Partition Resolution is that it was passed by the General Assembly (and not by the
Security Council), and is, therefore, not binding. They pretend to forget that it was the
General Assembly, which &#147;Acting in discharge of its functions under Article 4 of the
Charter and rule 125 of its rules of procedure&#148; had decided &#147;to admit Israel to
membership in the United Nations&#148; (Resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949). They fail to
realize, moreover, that if the principles of justice were applied in this matter without
fear or favour, Israel&#146;s eligibility in the organization would become entirely
untenable because of its refusal to honour two of the conditions under which it was
granted membership. The first of these conditions which stems from the UN Charter
specifies that Member States must publicly define their borders. In the second instance,
Israel also gave an undertaking to the UN to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to
their homes. Half a century later, the Jewish State continues to defy the international
community by refusing both to define its borders and allow the refugees to return to their
homes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given their ambiguous favouring of Security Council resolutions over those
of the General Assembly, it must be pointed out that it was the former that adopted
resolution 478 in 1980 censuring &#147;in the strongest terms the enactment by Israel of
the &#145;Basic Law&#146; on Jerusalem and the refusal to comply with relevant Security
Council resolutions.&#148; While there is not a single UN resolution supporting the
Israeli argument that resolution 181 is invalid, the Security Council has actually
declared that the Basic Law and all such measures adopted by Israel to change the
geographic, demographic and historical character and status of &#147;the Holy City of
Jerusalem are null and void and must be rescinded&#148; (resolution 476). Instead of
complying with the will of the Council, the Israelis have persisted in their campaign to
mislead public opinion on the issue of Jerusalem. Throughout the past six months they
found no better place to advance this cause than the busy stations of the London
Underground.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Underground</b></u><br>
As expected, the decision by the Israeli Tourist Board to post billboards in the London
Underground depicting the Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem and the Dome of the Rock did
provoke widespread public indignation. More than 20,000 letters of protest were sent to
the relevant authorities demanding their immediate withdrawal. The first poster that
appeared in January 1999 bore the caption: &#147;In the land where the millennium
began&#133;the Dome has already been built.&#148; Local Muslims as well as Christians
viewed the stunt not only as an affront to their religious sensitivities but also as an
assault on Britain&#146;s sovereignty, particularly because it has always maintained that
east Jerusalem is occupied territory. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While the official response to the letter campaign claimed that there was
no deliberate attempt to make a political statement concerning the legal status of east
Jerusalem, it did accede that a play was made on the Millennium Dome in London to lure
holiday makers to Israel. Despite the removal of the posters in February and written
assurances from the authorities that they will not be displayed again at any point in the
future, the Israeli Tourist Board somehow managed to restore them six months later, albeit
with a modified photograph and caption, the latest being: &#147;Can you really experience
the millennium in SE 10?&#148; With the word &#147;Israel&#148; tucked into a corner of
the poster, the tacit and deceptive suggestion is that a visit to the Dome of the Rock
will be a more rewarding experience than going to the London Millennium Dome.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From weakness to strength</b></u><br>
In spite of its cunning and ferocity, Israel&#146;s latest media offensive has been wholly
counter-productive. By using one of Europe&#146;s busiest thoroughfares to preempt the
final status of Jerusalem, it managed to win few friends and alienate many. Time and
circumstances have played a crucial role in this. Unlike the decades preceding 1967,
public awareness about Jerusalem has changed considerably. As the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict enters its second century, people are no longer beguiled by empty slogans about
anti-Semitism and Arab or Islamic terrorism. They have learnt, in fact, that national
histories are not simply about personalities, no matter how media-friendly or articulate
they may appear. And that what matters most today is the ability of States to honour their
treaty obligations, respect human rights and aspirations, and uphold the principles of
equality and justice. Hence they continue to ask, what is the value of peace to the
Palestinians if it censors their freedom, usurps their land and denies their humanity?! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gone were the days when Israel could contravene Palestinian national
rights on the pretext that all Arabs are undemocratic and Israel is the sole defender of
democracy in the region. Surely it is common knowledge that Israel is the only
&#147;democracy&#148; in the world that legalizes torture and enforces apartheid policies
against its subject people. It demolishes their homes, confiscates their identity
documents and evicts them from their homes not because it is right but only because it has
the power to do so. As a result, the isolation that has befallen the Jewish State has
nothing to do with the personalities of its leaders. It is rather the consequence of its
oppressive policies against the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For all intents and purposes, the presence of the Jerusalem posters in the
London Underground is a natural extension of these policies. Their collective and
unquestioned illegitimacy is confirmed in UN Security Council resolution 476. &#147;That
all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying
power, which purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, have
no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention.&#148; No amount of media spin will alter this fact. Not even the miraculous
mantra of anti-Semitism, which in the past opened the doors to Palestine, can change the
legal status of Jerusalem. True, in the present circumstances Israel may succeed in
imposing its political and military authority over the city. This, nevertheless, must
rightly be seen as a deferral of the issue until such time that the balance of power
changes.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A final word of caution must be noted. Far too often Arabs and non-Arabs
alike have tended to exaggerate the power of Israel. Recent events in the region have,
however, shattered the myth of its invincibility. The example of southern Lebanon is a
classic example. There it was defeated by a small but organized liberation army that had
none of the weapons or technology of its enemy. In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
it came face to face with similar humiliation before it was rescued by the 1993 Oslo
accords. Today, Israel relies largely upon the CIA to maintain &#147;law and order&#148;
in the territories it illegally occupies. Judging from these two examples, it is clear
that Israel got to the position where it is today not so much because of its strength but
rather because of the weakness of its adversaries. To reverse this situation the words of
the veteran Palestinian leader Haidar Abdul Shafi remain as relevant now as they were when
he proclaimed them in July 1993: &#147;I tell you plainly that the negotiations are not
worth fighting about. The critical issue is transforming our society. Only once we achieve
this will we be in a position of strength..&#148;</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">A Tale of Six Villages</font></b><i></font mstheme></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Ramzy Baroud</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two large Palestinian delegations protested Israeli ruthlessness on the
mornings of Friday and Saturday, 11 and 12 June 1999.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One delegation represented three Palestinian villages that were destroyed
in the war of 1967. The other delegation represented three other Palestinian villages
facing destruction at the present time by Israel and its Jewish settlers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thirty-two years ago, while the war between Israel and the Arabs was still
in effect, Israeli army occupation forces launched a campaign of terror against
Palestinians residing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Part of the campaign included destroying the three peaceful villages of
Imwas, Yalu and Beit Nuba, located halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The three villages were entirely destroyed, as if they never existed.
Those who remained and fought were savagely murdered. Those who fled the once-happy place
had to live with the anguish and loss like millions of Palestinians refugees scattered in
almost every corner of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, the villagers, like most Palestinians, never abandoned their dream of
returning to their homes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Knowing that the only thing Israel spared from the ruins of these three
villages was the old graveyard where many of the fallen martyrs are still buried, the
refugees have tried to reach the graves of their elders for many years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the permanent Israeli military checkpoint on the road between the
villages and the West Bank town of Ramallah has always shattered the hopes of the locals
who attempted to visit the legendary site.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday 11 June, the only successful Palestinian delegation finally made
it to the destroyed villages. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Scores of Palestinians gathered beside the abandoned graveyard. They read
Qur&#146;an for the souls of their loved ones. Around noon they prayed the Friday prayer
in the open, facing Mecca and the place that once was their olive groves. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Ehud Barak&#146;s peace promises, Israel will not pull back
to the borders of the 1967 war. Such a threat, if carried out, means that the three
villages located in the western section of the West Bank will remain under Israeli control
and will not be inhabited again by its anxiously awaiting owners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The people of the three villages are worried that they will fall victims
of &#147;peace&#148; the same way their fathers and mothers fell victims of war.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The next day, a delegation from the villages of Azun Itmeh, Beit Amin, and
Sinyria, located near the Palestinian town of Qalqiliah, protested Jewish settlers'
confiscation of their land under the protection of Israeli forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The three threatened villages are located between two ever-expanding
Israeli settlements: Oranit and Tishari Tiqfa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a result, the two Israeli settlements have been slowly expanding at the
expense of the land of Palestinian farmers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The decision to build a new neighbourhood as an addition to one of the two
settlements (which was approved by the Israeli Interior Ministry two years ago) gave a
green light to the Israeli army bulldozers to openly confiscate the land which belonged to
the Palestinian residents of the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The irony is the destruction of the first-mentioned villages, occupied in
1967, took place in time of war. Nowadays, the destruction of the latter-mentioned
villages and many more villages located in the West Bank and on the outskirts of Jerusalem
is taking place at a time that the world celebrates the courage and heroism of the
peacemakers in the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After 32 years of occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, many things have
indeed changed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One main difference is the world&#146;s definitions of peace, war and
occupation have been extensively rewritten.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While Israeli occupation forces are still controlling most of the West
Bank and Gaza, including their control over the borders while letting loose the herd of
Jewish settlers to conduct their acts of piracy, the world is heaving a big sigh of relief
to thank God, as peace has finally made it to the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But with 32 years having passed, the inhabitants of these six villages,
destroyed in 1967 and 1999, hold onto age-old principles that they have written in their
hearts, rather than on an unworthy piece of paper. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is these principles that have brought the people of Imwas, Yalu and
Beit Nuba back together to pray beside the abandoned grave yard; it is these principles
that have made the people of Azun Itmeh, Beit Amin and Sinyria stand with empty hands and
faithful hearts in front of the Israeli bulldozers to defend their land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a fundamental principle in truth that cannot easily be comprehended
or understood. But for those Palestinians, and perhaps for all the victims of occupation
and dispossession, it is the only way to seek justice.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">All that Talk about Democracy</font></b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic"></font mstheme></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>By Ray Hanania*</strong></em></font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember as a young Diaspora Palestinian many years ago being inspired
by the repeated references Palestinian revolutionaries made to the term
&quot;Democracy&quot;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was &quot;Democracy&quot; this. &quot;Democracy&quot; that. Remember
the stated goal of the Revolution upon the liberation of our homeland: The creation of a
&quot;Democratic&quot; non-sectarian State in Palestine where &quot;Jews, Christians and
Muslims&quot; would be treated equally? Well, certainly, Palestine has not been liberated.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, while we have been occupied for many years now, I wonder if we are
not now, in fact, imprisoned. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, it must be hard for people to live in a Democracy. At least,
that's how it seems to us Diaspora Palestinians who shake our heads these days at all the
news reports of silly but serious confrontations that are taking place as
&quot;Democracy&quot; sweeps through the un-liberated lands of Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The repeated arrests of Palestinian journalists are not surprising
headlines. When you realize that it's not the Israelis doing the arresting but members of
the Palestinian's own secret police handcuffing other Palestinians for &quot;free
speech&quot; violations, it gives me pause. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And just as we once decried the growing radicalism of the fanatic Israeli
Zionist movement, and the growth of hardcore conservative Jewish extremism, we now see the
same thing happening to us. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Nazareth, for the first time, Palestinians can start worrying not about
the Israelis confiscating our lands, but Muslims and Christians battling over the
closeness of a Mosque to a Church. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My head shakes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Or, in Bethlehem, where one telephone call from a &quot;Christian&quot;
television viewer complaining about a &quot;play&quot; that didn't exactly cast
Christianity in the &quot;proper light&quot; has the Palestinian police raiding and
closing the offices of the independent TV station Al Roa. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Very sad, and my head shakes even more. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is terrible in all this is that it seems from these and other reports
that we Palestinians make great sufferers. In suffering at the hands of the Israeli
occupiers, we were able to find solidarity with each other, Christians and Muslim
Palestinians, Bethlehemites and Nazarenes. When we are not suffering at their hands, we
seem to look for suffering and make each other suffer more. The PA needs to dust off some
of the old writings of Arafat and other revolutionaries and remember the importance of
&quot;Democracy.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Christians and Muslims back home have to stop thinking about
themselves and start thinking of the Palestinian Arab community. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a Palestinian, it is embarrassing to see our people do exactly those
things that we once abhorred in others. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, it's not just the PA. There are religious fanatics who insist on
imposing upon society their rigid religious standards and their interpretations of both
the Qur&#146;an and the Bible. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No one is stopping a Priest or an Imam from lecturing about Christianity
and Islam from the pulpit. But, it doesn't belong in government, and it doesn't belong in
the news media. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA needs to re-open Al Roa TV and stop acting like they don't know
what the term &quot;Democracy&quot; means. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is an important lesson the PA has missed that many in the United
States already know. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here, the government allows their critics to speak freely, because the
government knows that muzzling someone's opinion usually gets a lot more media attention
than the opinion you are trying to silence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And to those self-appointed religious vigilantes: the truth of a message
is much more powerful when it has been challenged by that with which you do not agree. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, criticism makes the intended target a much more powerful
force. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Jews and Muslims in the Post-Israel Era</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It has been 15 centuries since the Muslims established themselves as a
State in which followers of all three monotheistic religions coexisted peacefully and
equitably. Until the beginning of the 19th century, the Islamic empire, whose terrain
extended over three continents, provided an atmosphere of tolerance that, in contrast to
the history of Europe and the Western world in general, prevented the progression of
ideological and religious differences into physical conflict. Islam, whose values and
principles governed the public and private conduct of individuals and groups, recognized
the citizenship rights of Christians and Jews within the Islamic State. In accordance with
these rights, their blood, honour, wealth, faith and shrines were sanctified. This
recognition enabled the followers of these creeds to realize their potential capabilities
and thus innovate and participate on equal footing with the Muslims in building the
Arab-Islamic civilization. Muslims never used the term 'minorities' to describe fellow
citizens who followed other religions. The Islamic State provided a safe haven for those
oppressed in their own countries. Jews in particular suffered persecution and banishment
at the hands of European Christians who blamed them for every single crisis or catastrophe
incurred. It was only in Muslim lands that the Jews found peace, security and freedom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Muslims' perception of the Jews remained unchanged during the first 13
centuries of Islamic rule. They saw them as People of the Book who, together with the
Christians, shared with the Muslims common values of faith and conduct that entitled them
to citizenship rights in the Islamic State. Such perception began to change after the
Zionist movement managed to embroil Jews in its colonial project with the aim of
establishing a national home for the 'Jewish People' in Palestine. In the wake of the
Second World War, and as a result of the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany, the
scene was set for the accomplishment of the Zionist dream. The determination of the World
Order to enable the Zionists to establish a Jewish State in Palestine turned Jews into
enemy number one of both Arabs and Muslims. The Muslim hatred for the Jews was augmented
by the fall of Arab Jews into the trap of Zionism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Historic homes of Jewish communities, such as the Arab Maghreb, Egypt,
Iraq and Yemen, witnessed a massive exodus of Jews who migrated to the recently
established Zionist entity in Palestine. It turned out later that it was the Zionist
movement's acts of terror that intimidated the Arab Jews into emigrating. It was then that
the Arabs no longer discriminated between the Zionist invaders who came all the way from
Poland, Russia, America, Western Europe or South Africa and the Jews who had been living
with Arab Muslims and Christians, and who, for many centuries, shared the same history and
civilization with them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In spite of the undisguised secularist<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> even
atheist<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> root of the Zionist project, some Arab and Muslim
thinkers deemed it necessary, perhaps even useful, to focus on a purely religious
explanation for the Zionist phenomenon. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Through a re-reading of history, aided by a re-interpretation of the
sacred text, these thinkers sought to prove that Jews, by virtue of some inherited
characteristics, have always been corrupt and ill intentioned. But the real help came from
Christian anti-Jewish writings. The most influential document in this regard was the one
entitled, &#147;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&#148;, which concludes that Jews have
hatched a global conspiracy aimed at imposing their control over the world and at
subjugating all else to their influence so as to serve their own interests. The occupation
of Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish State in it have been said by the believers
in this theory to be a crucial part of the Jewish conspiracy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some Muslim writers have gone as far as interpreting the Qur'anic
narrative <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Israelites and the Jews in light of what the Protocols had
claimed. Hostility toward the Zionist project may have blurred the eyes of many Muslims
from seeing the difference between the Qur'anic chastisement of bad conduct and
ill-manners, which some Israelites and some Jews practised (and which Muslims and
Christians have been warned from copying) and the Qur'anic injunction concerning the right
of Jews, as well as Christians, to Covenant rights, the violation of which by Muslims is a
sin in the eyes of God. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Undoubtedly, the Zionist project bears full responsibility for this shift
in the Arab and Muslim perception of Jews and Judaism. After all, it was this Zionist
project that embroiled Judaism in its intrigues so as to bestow religious legitimacy on
itself and to gain the support of the world's Jewry. The myths of a 'Jewish nation', the
'Land of Promise' and the 'Chosen People of God' were revived in order to convince the
Jews, most of whom had initially been opposed to Zionism, to adopt the Zionist solution to
the Jewish problem in the West. The ultimate objective had been to persuade the Jews to
sponsor the State of Israel, which had been given a theological dimension that transformed
it in the Zionized Jewish conscience into 'the end of time Messiah'. The ideology was in
the beginning condemned by Jewish religious leaders as an adulteration of Jewish faith
that had been predominant until the beginning of the 20th century and which forbade Jewish
migration into Palestine with the purpose of settling there permanently. Such an action
was viewed by Jewish Orthodoxy as a violation that entailed the forcing of the will of God
and that amounted to the sin of apostasy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Arabs and Muslims still do not realize that anti-Zionist Jews, who do
not recognize the legitimacy of the State of Israel, do still exist. In spite of the
gradual decline in their numbers during the first seven decades of the 20th century,
anti-Zionist Jews are now believed to be on the increase. There are indications that the
trend of Jewish anti-Zionism is growing. This may, at least partly, be due to the
increasing public consciousness of the racist and fascist nature of the State of Israel
whose policy and actions contravene the sublime values which people of religion from all
faiths respect and seek to protect. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In essence, the Zionist project is a Western colonial enterprise whose
success depends on two main factors. The first factor is the determination of a powerful
West to see this enterprise continue. The second factor is the weakness of the Arabs and
the Muslims who have lost the ability to defend themselves. As for the first factor, so
long as the Zionist project serves the purposes of the current World Order, and so long as
the economic and military capabilities of this World Order permit it to prolong the life
of Israel, no effort will be spared in sustaining Israel. However, no sane person would
imagine that this situation would continue forever. The imperialist West is in retreat and
its escalating domestic problems will soon preoccupy it and divert its attention from many
foreign affairs that have so far been considered strategic interests. The Zionist entity
lacks the ability to self-sustain and therefore cannot survive without the U.S. umbilical
cord that supplies it with funds and weapons. As for the second factor, the weakness of
the Arabs and Muslims is only temporary and will sometime in the future be reversed.
Evidently, the Muslim world is witnessing a massive awakening that may be destined to
initiate the change from weakness to strength. When Arab and Muslim gain of strength and
confidence coincides with the retreat of the West due to the shrinkage in material and
military resources and the augmentation of domestic crises, the end of the Zionist project
will come and the State of Israel will no longer be. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, what about the Jews? How will they be perceived by the Arabs and the
Muslims? How are they going to be treated? How will the Qur'anic text referring to them be
interpreted? Will they, after all, have a place in our region and in our culture, or are
we going to annul their right to the Covenant guaranteed to them by God and His Messenger?
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Preparation for the post-Israel era should now begin. This would have to
include a revision and elimination of false concepts that make no distinction between Jews
and Zionists. The first is a bearer of Jewish faith and if not involved in aggression
against the Muslims is entitled to the right of Covenant. The second is a bearer of a
settler colonial enterprise, an aggressor that should be resisted and deterred. This
revision necessitates restoring respect to the contextual interpretation of the Qur'anic
text which clearly distinguishes in its narration of the history of the Israelites and the
Jews between those who do well and those who do not and between those who are righteous
and those who are mischievous. It also necessitates exposing fabricated documents such as
the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and discrediting conspiracy theory explanations of
past and present events. While doing so, respect should be reinstated to the Qur'anic
justice-based <i>tadafu' (</i>interaction of forces) theory, which is a much more credible
explanatory paradigm and which, unlike the conspiracy theory, provides motivation and
hope.</p>

  <p ALIGN="LEFT">4. Accusing Islamists of anti-Semitism</p>
  </i></b><p ALIGN="LEFT">The conflict between the Zionist enterprise embodied in Israel and
  the Islamic movement represented by resistance to occupation and insistence on its rights
  is in an ascending mode of escalation. The manifestations of mobilization and mobility in
  the public Islamic discourse in confronting the Zionist settler project will, without
  doubt, impose itself on the agendas of the coming century. For that reason, if for no
  other, the Jewish-Zionist forces will pursue the Islamic plan and accuse it of
  anti-Semitism. They will say that this type of anti-Semitism has religious roots and
  retainers. These same forces will continue to incite Western governments and societies to
  confine and inhibit Islamic trends under the pretext that these trends are Satanic forces
  that are out to get the Jews and Judaism. All this talk about resisting occupation is a
  smokescreen for the true intent and purpose.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This Zionist quest is out to paralyze Muslim potential beyond the Middle
  East, to stifle Muslims from any political initiative, media fairness, or humanitarian
  outreach in support of the Islamic issue pertinent to Palestine.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic side is expected to raise its tactical consciousness
  concerning this Zionist-Jewish task. It is also expected to define the nature of this
  hostility and the fact of this problem with Jews and Judaism that are enthralled to the
  Zionist master-plan. This much-talked-about conflict has to be reduced to its basics so
  that everyone will know where they stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Zionist usurpation of
  Palestine the land and Judaism the religion. This issue has to shine as a life-and-death
  issue against the core-Zionists whose racism denies the other, in this case the Arab, and
  then takes away his right to exist. What should shine through also is the fact that
  Islamists have no problems with Judaism, Jews, or Jewish communities living outside of
  occupied Palestine since 1948. Jews, from an Islamic perspective, are as equal and civil
  as other ethnic and religious minorities who were treated fairly during the heyday of
  Islam. The mutual history of Muslims and Jews testifies to the tolerance and courtesy
  Muslims expressed towards their Jewish minority population. The instances of conflict that
  spoiled this well-mannered relationship began with some unbecoming acts by some Jewish
  factions during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). This
  was also true during the last years of the Ottoman State owing to colonialist instigation
  about a Zionist settler regime on Palestinian territory.</p>
  <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">The Future: Options and Chances</p>
  </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">As the Islamic tide gains momentum and as its popular and official
  scope increases, the eventuality of Islamic political zones here and there are more likely
  to take shape in the near rather than distant future. The entrenchment of the Islamic
  venture and the complementary role of incremental political units will all thread together
  in a federation or a confederation within the coming two decades and will render a
  thorough reassessment of the Jewish problem in only a matter of time. Within this larger
  consolidated Islamic reality, Jews will have to be accommodated as an ethnic and religious
  minority along the lines of equity and fairness attested to by the different phases of
  Islamic history. This rather overwhelming optimism of Islamic activism&#146;s future and
  the potential for a solidified if not unified political order may seem to some as a
  figment of the imagination. That may be attributable to the pathetic conditions of
  marginality that the Muslims are in today. Muslims today are notorious for their
  dissension, discord and dependency. This is exemplified by the way most Arab officialdoms
  are running over each other trying to pay tribute and allegiance to Israel, or at least
  striving towards normalization and reconciliation with it. Israel&#146;s racism and
  settler expansionism go unnoticed in these Arab circles, even while Arab land is still
  under occupation and even while Islamic sanctuaries in <i>al-Quds</i> (Jerusalem) and
  al-Khalil (Hebron) are still tied to Israeli diktat and Judaization. But this overly
  optimistic view is attributable to a conviction that the Zionist proposition has run its
  course. Ideological and sectarian conflict within Israeli society is spelling a
  post-Zionist script. Only then will the Jews of Palestine face the facts and consequences.
  At that moment in time they shall realize that they need to come to terms with their Arab
  and Islamic neighbours with all that goes with that, especially a redress of the
  Palestinian rights.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamists face a challenge of a priority nature on the Islamic agenda
  in the coming century: to stimulate the Islamic masses out of apathy, frustration and
  defeatism, <i>vis-à-vis</i> Israel, into the highest state of alert. Muslims have to pull
  themselves, expeditiously, out of this rut and work for change. Triumph will come once
  everyone is sure that the conflict with the Zionist enterprise represented now by Israel
  is inevitable. Israel has to be checked before it poisons the whole region at the
  existential level. Only in this context will the Islamic plan make its imprint on history.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">There is a general roll-back in popular convictions about the
  quasi-sovereignty of the nation-State formula of governance in both the Arab and Islamic
  spheres. Popular demands are growing for an alternative political formula that is able to
  coagulate the political will of the ummah. This formula would have to have the
  accommodating ingredients of incorporating the Jewish minority that dwells in Palestine.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Offering stability for the Jewish people within the emerging Arab and
  Islamic paradigm will mean that these Jews located within the realm of an Islamic society
  would have to shed their Zionist ideology which&#151;up until this very moment&#151;is
  couched in terms of expansionism and settler policies that deny others their rights and
  their lands. These neighbourly Jews would also have to cease their threats and their
  operation &#147;Judaization&#148; of Islamic landmarks and holy places. The Jews must come
  to grips with the presence of a permanent and prevalent Islam which would address the
  rights of the Palestinian people and make room for new ideas and practical solutions that
  make for true peace and security for all the inhabitants of the area.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Time is not on the side of a belligerent Israel. The way things are going,
  the future shall reveal many more increments of an Islamic political reality taking shape.
  This fact will cancel out all the artificial and outdated leftovers of the Sykes-Picot
  agreement. When this future reality sets, Israel as a nation-State with its current
  Zionist definition will come to an end. People such as Jews will have their right to
  determine their destiny but within a totally new set of values, standards and rules. By
  virtue of the emerging Islamic political order and its far-flung geo-politics, we may even
  begin to see a reversal of the Jewish <i>alia</i> that characterized the 1940s and 1950s
  when tens of thousands of Jews left their original Arab domicile to forcibly settle in
  Palestine. These Jews, with the vitality of a larger and robust Islamic State, will have
  the right to relocate to the lands from which they left under Zionist enticements when
  they went to the Holy Land. They will also have the freedom to relocate anywhere else
  within this expansive Islamic political region extending from Africa&#146;s Atlantic to
  Asia&#146;s Pacific. This new dynamic will have the Palestinians, obviously, asking for
  their long-lost rights subsequent to Zionist usurpation of Palestine; but it will also
  have Jews who made their <i>alia</i> or who were forced to flee their country of origin in
  the Arab homeland also asking for their civil redresses and property compensations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic public declaration of intentions along with its legitimate
  concern with mobilizing the masses for resisting and trouncing Zionist occupation has to
  prove that it is prepared to consider any serious political rivalry that seeks to end the
  conflict and work for a permanent and comprehensive peace.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">No one argues the fact that right needs force to protect and advance it.
  These long years of conflict with Israel have driven home to the U.S. a most telling
  lesson. And that is that occupied Palestinian lands will not be recovered unless Israel
  feels in a tangible way that it is in mortal danger. This fact makes armed resistance
  against Israel a necessary mechanism that will induce Israel into recognizing Palestinian
  rights. It may cause Israel to reconsider in a positive and sanguine way the possibility
  of integrating into a larger Arab/Islamic context.</p>

<font FACE="Traditional Arabic">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic paradigm is not a pipe-dream. It is a fact of life being
retrenched and reinforced in theory and in practice year after year. The growing
conviction and the heated discussions within certain Islamic circles about the dismantling
of Israel as a nation-State within two to three decades are purviews of a reality taking
shape and of strong beliefs taking off. These predictions are also the product of similar
experiences germane to this particular area of the world. This land round of such mass
intrusion into the Holy Land was represented by the Crusades; but then their cycle came to
an end in the Middle East. There are also many developments that will impact the nature of
the Israeli-American strategic relationship. These predictions are also drawn from a
reading of future events. The American-Israeli strategic pact shall one day terminate
because America&#146;s vital interests are in more ways than one tied to the Arab/Islamic
world. The test for the U.S. administration will finally come when it will have to choose
between its bias to Israel or its factoring in of the Arab/Islamic world. Currently,
Israel to all observers even in traditionally pro-Israeli Western circles is the
intransigent party that has stonewalled on fair attempts at a comprehensive and just
peace. It is Israel that is throwing obstacles in the way of peace. This reading of events
also presumes an active political role for Muslims in the West that is able to break the
monopoly of Jews on decisions pertaining to American policy in the Middle East. The
Muslims in the U.S. could play a role capable of bringing pressure to bear on the decision
makers in formulating balanced and fair policies <i>vis-à-vis</i> the issues and peoples
of the Middle East.</p>

<blockquote>
  </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">Undoubtedly, when the U.S. adopts fair and balanced policies in the
  area, Israel will understand and take account of its true diminutive size in the region.
  It will then begin to lose interest in its grandstand positions, its Zionist impulse. At
  that point it will wake up and find itself in the middle of an Arab and Islamic world that
  requires integration. If the human factor of Israel is able to make this leap of faith and
  reason, it will show that it is ready to be counted as a member of the region and people
  it is in, with all the civilized and cultural contexts involved. When that day comes, we
  will all see progress, prosperity and restoration of normal human relations.</p>

deals with an important and often neglected subject: the Palestinian exodus and the
creation of the refugee problem. The intimate and causal connection between these two
events, the refugee exodus and the creation of the Jewish state in Palestine, has rarely
been defined and the two issues have customarily been treated as separate events.<br>
This book analyses this connection and reviews the Palestinian exodus from 1948, through
1967, right up to the present time with the continuing expulsion of Palestinians from
Jerusalem. It explores the themes of compensation for Palestinians, the right of return of
the refugees to Israel and the feasibility of return. It also sets out a vision for a
future solution to the refugee problem, which remains an outstanding obstacle in the way
of a lasting peace between the two sides.<br>
By bringing together historians, academics and legal experts to provide different
perspectives, this book aims to address all the major aspects of this complex issue. As
such, it forms essential reading for scholars and also for general readers concerned with
the primary causes of and the solutions to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<br>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Kosovo war and problem of Muslim minorities</font></font mstheme></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>By Munir Shafiq*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the war launched by NATO and led by the United States reached an end,
negotiators from the U.S., Russia and the European Union gathered round the negotiations
table to lay down conditions to stop the NATO strikes against Yugoslavia. The results of
those negotiations were conveyed to the Yugoslavian President Milosevic to take his
approval. But no one paid any attention to the stands of the representatives of the Kosovo
Albanians who were a main party in the Rambouillet, France, negotiations. The Kosovo
Albanians were completely excluded from the negotiations, which led to stopping the air
strikes and entry of the NATO forces into Kosovo.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This tragic end of the war indicates that the war was launched for reasons
that have nothing to do with the injustice practiced against the Kosovo Albanians. In
fact, it was waged to achieve goals that are far from the goal adopted by the Kosovo
Muslims. Using the injustice created by the Serbs against the Kosovo Albanians as a
pretext to wage the war does not really mean that the war was started to defend the Kosovo
Albanians. This reality would not change if the Kosovo Muslims had some of their
objectives achieved because what they will get was not meant to be achieved by this war.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first remark that should attract attention is that the representatives
of the Kosovo Albanians were kept away from the negotiations table and were not given any
say in the agreement on Kosovo, their homeland. The referendum about the future of Kosovo
was also kept at a distance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second remark is that the negotiations were mainly conducted between
the Russians and the Americans with a second-class European partnership. This shows that
it was a war between the United States and Russia, not a war against Milosevic. This fact
does not change given Russia&#146;s weak and hesitant position during the war, especially
after firing Primakov&#146;s government. The leadership of the Russian army got the
message of war, which caused it to announce its reservations on the agreement reached
between Chernomyrdin and NATO. This attitude by the Russian army was proved when the
Russian troops rushed to occupy Pristina airport in Kosovo, which distracted the attention
from the celebrations of what Clinton called the NATO victory and Milosevic&#146;s defeat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The occupation of Pristina airport by the Russian troops and their
preventing NATO troops from entering the airport led to a direct confrontation between the
U.S. and Russia. This proves that the war waged by the United States against the Serbs was
in essence a war against Russia or a part of a strategy to contain the Russians and to
weaken their international role, especially in Europe.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third party concerned with this war was Europe, which seemed to be
subject to the Americans and involved the military policies of the U.S. Administration. It
is not an exaggeration to say that the second main reason of the war that was planned by
the U.S. is to contain Europe after it began expanding its margin of independence
economically after issuing the unified European currency (Euro) and politically after
adopting a more distinctive role towards many international issues, including the Arab and
Islamic ones. In the military field, Europe also began creating a unified and independent
military force inside and outside NATO. It was clear that Europe, except Britain, was
compelled to participate in the war. Europe tried to end the war as soon as possible by
different means. It tried to establish for itself a political role during the negotiations
and a military one through the final arrangements in Kosovo. This made it a competitive
partner of the United States and not a mere subordinate partner that lacks any role or
will of its own.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyone who looks into Kosovo&#146;s map after the end of the war does not
doubt Milosevic&#146;s defeat. Kosovo became a NATO protectorate with a Russian
partnership under the moral supervision of the United Nations. Although the Kosovo
Albanians became free of ethnic oppression, they also fell under foreign protection and
have no right to control their land or draw their future more than what they already had
under the Serbian control. On the contrary, the Kosovo Albanians under the Serbian rule
had a cause to defend and political demands to fight for. But now they are not able to ask
NATO to give them their self-determination or to determine their authorities and rights.
This means that they lost their cause and lost the right to map out their future. The only
gains they received are the freedom from ethnic oppression and the right to return to
their homes. They could get more and better if they accepted to be ruled by the Serbs in
the way they are now ruled by NATO.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Muslim minorities should possess a deep and correct awareness
concerning any attempt to separate them from the countries they are living in, or rather
their own countries. They should be aware of the dangers and consequences of being moved
by a few elite powers towards separation and against the non-Muslim majorities. Such
attempts, regardless of their causes and reasons, will lead to massacres, misery and
ethnic cleansing. They will make the Muslim minorities toys in the hands of the
international and regional powers. They will also lose control over their future and fate.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A deliberate reading of the international and regional situations and of
the situation of the Muslim Nation does not allow any illusion about the dangers of the
calls for separation of any Muslim minority from the country they have been living in for
hundreds and thousands of years. Whatever the injustice being experienced by the Muslim
minority is, they should beware of any attempt to separate because the international
balance of power and the situation of the Islamic Nation will make their just and fair
demands a toy or a pretext for the regional and international powers in their conflicts
among themselves. They will also make this minority the first victim of these conflicts.
Each minority should deal positively with other citizens in their country. They should
follow the path of patience, peaceful Jihad and the step-by-step policy in order to free
themselves from the injustice. This way will remain safer in most of the cases than the
other way that was adopted by the Kosovo Albanians or other Muslim minorities in the
world. However, it should not be understood that the causes of the Muslim minorities in
these parts of the world are not just. But these minorities should assess their own
situation and choose the lesser evil and less harmful way. It is also a strategic issue
related to the serious questions of the Muslim Nation, on the top of which is the
confrontation of the American-Zionist strategy because it is the most important obstacle
that prevents that Muslim Nation from achieving its goals. If, for example, the United
States will be the greatest party that benefits from a local problem stirred by or against
a Muslim minority, especially when it is escalated to a civil war and an ethnic cleansing,
we will find ourselves in contradiction between our higher strategy and our stand towards
this local or secondary problem. This was clear in the recent Kosovo crisis. For the whole
Muslim Nation had no other option but to stand beside the Kosovo Muslims. But this stand
also served the higher strategy of the United States, which eventually harms the interests
of the Muslim Nation in general and the Palestinian cause in particular.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The results of the war in Yugoslavia will never be local but rather
international. We will be affected and harmed because the United States went victorious
out of the war. Its power has increased more, which will enable it to rearrange the
international situation, especially the situation in the Arab region. This will help the
U.S. Administration to impose the Israeli conditions and domination over the Palestinians
and Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, open discussions and dialogues should be organized to review
the best and correct strategy that should be adopted by the Muslim minorities in treating
their causes and problems. There should be a general and international strategy in
addition to the local strategies of every Muslim and Arab society. The general strategy
consists of principles and guidelines that save the Muslim minorities from separation,
civil war, or ethnic cleansing. It also helps these minorities to build positive
strategies that can be accepted by the local situation and which can lift the injustice
against the Muslims gradually and peacefully. We should emphasize that the other way is
disastrous and does not achieve the goals of the Muslim minority. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Americans can say that they succeeded in forcing the Serbian army out
of Kosovo and that they are on their way to repatriating the Kosovo Albanian refugees to
their homes. They can also say that NATO remained united and that it was not forced to
start a land war.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, on the other side, Milosevic can say that Kosovo has remained legally
and officially under the Yugoslavian sovereignty, and that the NATO troops in Kosovo work
under the umbrella of the United Nations and not under their own flag as was agreed upon
in the Rambouillet talks. He can also say that the existence of Russian troops among the
international forces in Kosovo is a positive point that serves his interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the humiliation it received by the air strikes against Belgrade,
Russia can say that the war ended only after the United States recognized its decisive
role and participation in the international force. This role was also recognized through
direct negotiations with Russia. In short, Russia can be proud of achieving something,
especially in the settlement that was reached after its troops occupied Pristina airport.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most significant outcome of this war is that it will push the
international arena to more conflicts and confusion. It did widen the rift between Russia
and the United States. Europe has also found itself subject to the U.S. Administration,
which will lead it to build a military force of its own, parallel to the NATO forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The war in Yugoslavia has opened a new page of conflicts and disputes
among the big powers and allowed new international confusion.</p>

<font FACE="Arial"><font FACE="Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="center"></i>Part 17</font></p>
</font><i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gentiles in the Land of Israel</p>
</i></b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the general anti-Gentile laws, the Halakhah has special
laws against Gentiles who live in the Land of Israel <i>(Eretz Yisra'el) </i>or, in some
cases, merely pass through it. These laws are designed to promote Jewish supremacy in that
country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The exact geographical definition of the term 'Land of Israel' is much
disputed in the Talmud and the talmudic literature, and the debate has continued in modern
times between the various shades of Zionist opinion. According to the maximalist view, the
Land of Israel includes (in addition to Palestine itself) not only the whole of Sinai,
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, but also considerable parts of Turkey.<sup> </sup>The more
prevalent 'minimalist' interpretation puts the northern border 'only' about half way
through Syria and Lebanon, at the latitude of Homs. This view was supported by Ben-Gurion.
However, even those who thus exclude parts of Syria-Lebanon agree that certain special
discriminatory laws (though less oppressive than in the Land of Israel proper) apply to
the Gentiles of those parts, because that territory was included in David's kingdom. In
all talmudic interpretations, the Land of Israel includes Cyprus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I shall now list a few of the special laws concerning Gentiles in the Land
of Israel. Their connection with actual zionist practice will be quite apparent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Halakhah forbids Jews to sell immovable property-fields and houses- in
the Land of Israel to Gentiles. In Syria, the sale of houses (but not of fields) is
permitted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Leasing a house in the Land of Israel to a Gentile is permitted under two
conditions. First, that the house shall not be used for habitation but for other purposes,
such as storage. Second, that three or more adjoining houses shall not be so leased.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These and several other rules are explained as follows: ... 'so that you
shall not allow them to camp on the ground, for if they do not possess land, their sojourn
there will be temporary.&#146;<sup> </sup>Even temporary Gentile presence may only be
tolerated 'when the Jews are in exile, or when the Gentiles are more powerful than the
Jews,' but:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Jews are more powerful than the Gentiles we are forbidden to let
    an idolator among us; even a temporary resident or itinerant trader shall not be allowed
    to pass through our land unless he accepts the seven Noahide precepts,<sup> </sup>for it
    is written: 'they shall not dwell in thy land,' that is, not even temporarily. If he
    accepts the seven Noahide precepts, he becomes a resident alien (ger toshav) but it is
    forbidden to grant the status of resident alien except at times when the Jubilee is held
    [that is, when the Temple stands and sacrifices are offered]. However, during times when
    Jubilees are not held, it is forbidden to accept anyone who is not a full convert to
    Judaism (ger tzedeq).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">It is therefore clear that - exactly as the leaders and sympathisers of
  Gush Emunim say - the whole question to how the Palestinians ought to be treated is,
  according to the Halakhah, simply a question of Jewish power: if Jews have sufficient
  power, then it is their religious duty to expel the Palestinians.<br>
  All these laws are often quoted by Israeli rabbis and their zealous followers. For
  example, the law forbidding the lease of three adjoining houses to Gentiles was solemnly
  quoted by a rabbinical conference held in 1979 to discuss the Camp David treaties. The
  conference also declared that according to the Halakhah even the 'autonomy' that Begin was
  ready to offer to the Palestinians is too liberal. Such pronouncements - which do in fact
  state correctly the position of the Halakhah - are rarely contested by the zionist 'left'.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to laws such as those mentioned so far, which are directed at
  all Gentiles in the Land of Israel, an even greater evil influence arises from special
  laws against the ancient Canaanites and other nations who lived in Palestine before its
  conquest by Joshua, as well as against the Amalekites. All those nations must be utterly
  exterminated, and the Talmud and talmudic literature reiterate the genocidal biblical
  exhortations with even greater vehemence. Influential rabbis, who have a considerable
  following among Israeli army officers, identify the Palestinians (or even all Arabs) with
  those ancient nations, so that commands like 'thou shalt save alive nothing that
  breatheth' acquire a topical meaning. In fact, it is not uncommon for reserve soldiers
  called up to do a tour of duty in the Gaza Strip to be given an 'educational lecture' in
  which they are told that the Palestinians of Gaza are 'like the Amalekites'. Biblical
  verses exhorting to genocide of the Midianites<sup> </sup>were solemnly quoted by an
  important Israeli rabbi in justification of the Qibbiya massacre,<sup> </sup>and this
  pronouncement has gained wide circulation in the Israeli army. There are many similar
  examples of bloodthirsty rabbinical pronouncements against the Palestinians, based on
  these laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abuse<br>
</b></i></u>Under this heading I would like to discuss examples of halakhic laws whose
most important effect is not so much to prescribe specific anti-Gentile discrimination as
to inculcate an attitude of scorn and hatred towards Gentiles. Accordingly, in this
section I shall not confine myself to quoting from the most authoritative halakhic sources
(as I have done so far) but include also less fundamental works, which are however widely
used in religious instruction.<u><i><b></p>
</b></i></u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let us begin with the text of some common prayers. In one of the first
sections of the daily morning prayer, every devout Jew blesses God for not making him a
Gentile.<sup> </sup>The concluding section of the daily prayer (which is also used in the
most solemn part of the service on New Year's day and on Yom Kippur) opens with the
statement: 'We must praise the Lord of all ... for not making us like the nations of [all]
lands ... for they bow down to vanity and nothingness and pray to a god that does not
help. The last clause was censored out of the prayer books, but in eastern Europe it was
supplied orally, and has now been restored into many Israeli-printed prayer books, In the
most important section of the weekday prayer - the 'eighteen blessings' - there is a
special curse, originally directed against Christians, Jewish converts to Christianity and
other Jewish heretics: 'And may the apostates have no hope, and all the Christians perish
instantly'. This formula dates from the end of the 1st century, when Christianity was
still a small persecuted sect, Some time before the 14th century it was softened into:
'And may the apostates have no hope, and all the heretics<sup> </sup>perish instantly',
and after additional pressure into: 'And may the informers have no hope, and all the
heretics perish instantly'. After the establishment of Israel, the process was reversed,
and many newly printed prayer books reverted to the second formula, which was also
prescribed by many teachers in religious Israeli schools, After 1967, several
congregations close to Gush Emunim have restored the first version (so far only verbally,
not in print) and now pray daily that the Christians 'may perish instantly', This process
of reversion happened in the period when the Catholic Church (under Pope John XXIII)
removed from its Good Friday service a prayer which asked the Lord to have mercy on Jews,
heretics etc. This<i> </i>prayer was thought by most Jewish leaders to be offensive and
even antisemitic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from the fixed daily prayers, a devout Jew must utter special short
blessings on various occasions, both good and bad (for example, while putting on a new
piece of clothing, eating a seasonal fruit for the first time that year, seeing powerful
lightning, hearing bad news, etc.) Some of these occasional prayers serve to inculcate
hatred and scorn for all Gentiles. We have mentioned in Chapter 2 the rule according to
which a pious Jew must utter curse when passing near a Gentile cemetery, whereas he must
bless God when passing near a Jewish cemetery. A similar rule applies to the living; thus,
when seeing a large Jewish population a devout Jew must praise God, while upon seeing a
large Gentile population he must utter a curse. Nor are buildings exempt: the Talmud lays
down<sup> </sup>that a Jew who passes near an inhabited non-Jewish dwelling must ask God
to destroy it, whereas if the building is in ruins he must thank the Lord of Vengeance.
(Naturally, the rules are reversed for Jewish houses.) This rule was easy to keep for
Jewish peasants who lived in their own villages or for small urban communities living in
all-Jewish townships or quarters. Under the conditions of classical Judaism, however, it
became impracticable and was therefore confined to churches and places of worship of other
religions (except Islam).<sup> </sup>In this connection, the rule was further embroidered
by custom: it became customary to spit (usually three times) upon seeing a church or a
crucifix, as an embellishment to the obligatory formula of regret.<sup> </sup>Sometimes
insulting biblical verses were also added.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is also a series of rules forbidding any expression of praise for
Gentiles or for their deeds, except where such praise implies an even greater praise of
Jews and things Jewish. This rule is still observed by Orthodox Jews. For example, the
writer Agnon, when interviewed on the Israeli radio upon his return from Stockholm, where
he received the Nobel Prize for literature, praised the Swedish Academy, but hastened to
add: 'I am not forgetting that it is forbidden to praise Gentiles, but here there is a
special reason for my praise' - that is, that they awarded the prize to a Jew.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similarly, it is forbidden to join any manifestation of popular Gentile
rejoicing, except where failing to join in might cause 'hostility' towards Jews, in which
case a 'minimal' show of joy is allowed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the rules mentioned so far, there are many others whose
effect is to inhibit human friendship between Jew and Gentile. I shall mention two
examples: the rule on &#145;libation wine and that on preparing food for a Gentile on
Jewish holy days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A religious Jew must not drink any wine in whose preparation a Gentile had
any part whatsoever. Wine in an open bottle, even if prepared wholly by Jews, becomes
banned if a Gentile so much as touches the bottle or passes a hand over it. The reason
given by the rabbis is that all Gentiles are not only idolators but must be presumed to be
malicious to boot, so that they are likely to dedicate (by a whisper, gesture or thought)
as 'libation' to their idol any wine which a Jew is about to drink. This law applies in
full force to all Christians, and in a slightly attenuated form also to Muslims. (An open
bottle of wine touched by a Christian must be poured away, but if touched by a Muslim it
can be sold or given away, although it may not be drunk by a Jew.) The law applies equally
to Gentile atheists (how can one be sure that they are not merely pretending to be
atheists?) but not to Jewish atheists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The laws against doing work on the sabbath apply to a lesser extent on
other holy days. In particular, on a holy day which does not happen to fall on a Saturday
it is permitted to do any work required for preparing food to be eaten during the holy
days or days. Legally, this is defined as preparing a 'soul's food'<i>; </i>but 'soul' is
interpreted to mean 'Jew', and 'Gentiles and dogs' are explicitly excluded.<sup> </sup></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An important effect of all these laws - quite apart from their application
in practice - is in the attitude created by their constant study which, as part of the
study of the Halakhah, is regarded by classical Judaism as a supreme religious duty. Thus
an Orthodox Jew learns from his earliest youth, as part of his sacred studies, that
Gentiles are compared to dogs, that it is a sin to praise them, and so on and so forth. As
a matter of fact, in this respect, textbooks for beginners have a worse effect than the
Talmud and the great talmudic codes. One reason for this is that such elementary texts
give more detailed explanations, phrased so as to influence young and uneducated minds.
Out of a large number of such texts, I have chosen the one which is currently most popular
in Israel and has been reprinted in many cheap editions, heavily subsidised by the Israeli
government. It is The <i>Book of Education, </i>written by an anonymous rabbi in early
14th century Spain. It explains the 613 religious obligations <i>(mitzvot) </i>of Judaism
in the order in which they are supposed to be found in the Pentateuch according to the
talmudic interpretation. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">National Commission On The Causes <br>
And Prevention Of Terrorism</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Atif Harden*</b></p>
</i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Introduction</u></b><br>
Terrorism poses a problem to American policy-makers, first because we must define it in
order to zero in on its prevention, and, second, because the best prevention is a cure. It
is more effective and cheaper to address causes proactively than to respond reactively to
effects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the great national effort against terrorism, we should reject two false
premises. First we should reject the self-fulfilling prophecy of the &quot;clash of
civilizations.&quot; Second, we should reject the McCarthy-like tactic, used by some
unethical people, of asserting that Islam, Muslims, and American Muslim organizations
endorse terrorism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The American Muslim population and its organizations pose no violent
threat to the United States and our way of life. Speaking as an American, and as Executive
Director of the American Muslim Council, I am weary of hearing and seeing Islam and
Muslims portrayed as foreign and different. We are cousins of the Jews and Christians. We
worship the same God, follow the teachings of the same prophets, and believe in the same
books. We are all followers of Abraham.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islam is not new to our homeland. There is strong evidence that Muslims
were trading with the Americas before Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; the New World. Many
more Muslims came in the holds of slave ships. We literally helped build this nation. Our
roots are deep in America, and as immigrants from the Middle East, North Africa, the
Sub-Continent, Southeast Asia, and the Balkans arrive, they continue to enrich us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Muslim community in America is the model minority community in the
United States. We are a value-driven community, which shares a faith that is pro-family,
pro-education, anti-racist, pro-business, law abiding, and anti-crime. There are no Arab,
Pakistani, Somalian, Senegalese, or Indonesian ghettos in the United States. Muslims
living in disadvantaged communities are often the lights of these communities, promoting
family, education, cleanliness, chastity self-sufficiency, and zero tolerance toward the
drugs and the mental slavery that blight produces. We are one of the best-educated groups
in the nation, and have one of the lowest crime rates. Because of our commitment to serve
God and our country, Muslim doctors, lawyers, teachers, accountants, and businessmen are
serving in inner-city and rural communities, to which no one else in the country is
attracted.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Facts</u></b><br>
We must get our facts straight before we make policy. Is terrorism a tenet of Islam? <i>No!
</i>Are Muslims, or those who claim Islam as their motive, sometimes involved in terrorist
acts? <i>Yes. </i>Are Muslims involved in the majority or at least in a significant number
of domestic terrorist attacks? According to the FBI, <i>no! </i>Is the killing of innocent
men, women, and children supportable by Islamic religious doctrine? <i>No!</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Qur'an says: <i><b>&quot;Fight in the cause of Allah against those who
fight against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors&quot;</b></i>
(2:190).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And what are these limits? Some light is shed on them when we read the
instructions of the Prophet Muhammad to his followers, and also from the first caliph, Abu
Bakr.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Prophet Muhammad said, <i><b>&quot;I recommend you to stand in awe of
Allah, and be good to the Muslims who are with you. Fight in the name of Allah and in the
cause of Allah. Do not betray, do not be excessive, do not kill a child or a woman or an
old person, or a person who is secluded in a hermitage. Do not burn a date tree, nor cut
the trees, nor demolish buildings&quot;</b></i> (Sahih Muslim).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first caliph of Islam, Abu Bakr, said, &quot;Do not betray or be
treacherous or vindictive. Do not mutilate. Do not kill the children, the aged, or the
women. Do not cut or burn palm trees or fruit trees. Do not slay a sheep, a cow, or a
camel except for your food. And you will come across people who have confined themselves
to worship in monasteries. Leave them alone to their devotions.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Plea</u></b><br>
Given our long history, commitment, and contribution to our nation, we should try in our
public policy statements concerning Islam and Muslims to avoid the mistakes of the past.
We must resist those who want to blame and demonize an entire community for the crimes of
a few. Let us not give credence to the bigotry of those who will say that &quot;Islam is a
terrorist religion&quot; or &quot;a11 Muslims are terrorists&quot; or &quot;American
Muslim organizations are front groups for terrorists.&quot; We already know the danger and
stupidity of mass stereotyping. We did not elect a Catholic president until this century,
because people feared that a Catholic would be under the control of the Pope. Others
believe that we cannot have an Italian president because he would be under the influence
of the Mafia. And still others believe that Jews are a fifth column that can not be
trusted and whose loyalty will never lie with the United States. Not only have all these
fears proven to be unfounded, but it is patently ridiculous to stereotype entire groups in
this manner. We let our fears get out of control in the past, and we made a terrible
mistake with the Japanese American community by interning them during the Second World
War. Our national shame and regret over this incident continues to haunt us. Let us not
make this same mistake with Islam and the Muslim community.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our Prophet taught us that when one of us is oppressed, we are all
oppressed. So yes, Muslims feel the pain of our co-religionists and do support the efforts
of our brothers and sisters to escape oppression in Bosnia, Kosovo, Kashmir, Palestine,
Kenya, Uganda, Russia, India, China, and the Phillipines; just as Irish Americans
supported Catholics in Ireland; just as Polish Americans supported Solidarity; just as
American Jews support Israel; and just as African-Americans supported the liberation
struggles in Africa and, most specifically, Nelson Mandela in South Africa. Muslims do
nothing different than any other sub-group in our nation. We may support causes that are
not always understood by the public, but we are never m favor of injustice whether
committed by non-Muslims or Muslims. And we should not be persecuted for holding
&quot;incorrect&quot; political and policy beliefs.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Policy</u></b><br>
Under no circumstances, no matter how righteous the cause, can the taking of innocent
human life be justified. The political style of early Muslims was one where participants
aimed to persuade a wide audience to recognize the spiritual, moral, and political merit
of their cause. They were principled about methods and were willing to compromise and to
move patiently from one limited end to another.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Political violence is now becoming theatre where the aim of the political
act is nothing more than the venting of outrage. The cowardly acts of terrorism can not
drown out the ultimate righteousness of a cause. It is important that we realize that the
significance or legitimacy of a cause is not diminished because of the actions of a few
radicals. Every significant movement in this country has been plagued by radical excess:
the Independence Movement, the Anti-Slavery Movement, the Labor Movement, the Civil Rights
Movement, the Anti-War Movement, the Environmentalist Movement, the Animal Rights
movements, and now even the Anti-Abortion Movement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Terrorist acts occur when groups or individuals feel ignored,
marginalized, and inadequate facing a superior force. People's tactics must be condemned,
but their legitimate grievances must still be addressed.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Program</u></b><br>
In order for us to fight this problem of terrorism effectively, we must look closely not
only at the effects of this horrible problem, but also at its causes. Therefore, I would
like to recommend that the President and/or Congress establish a National Commission on
the Causes and Prevention of Terrorism. Congress has proposed a committee on
counter-terrorism, but this will deal only with the effects of the problem, and will not
address its root causes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have used this model quite effectively in the past, especially
concerning matters related to violence in our society. We have had the Warren Commission
and its report, which helped mute much of the agitation the country felt after the Kennedy
Assassination. We have also had the Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence
and the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. In both cases, if we had heard
the complaints and grievances earlier of those who testified, we probably would not have
seen the subsequent violence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Imagine how many lives would have been saved if Timothy MacVeigh could
have told us what was troubling him and those like him. It is easy for people to condemn
him and his like for the awful crimes they have committed, but we must still ask ourselves
whether his complaints and grievances could have been addressed through our political
system. Granted, some people are plain criminal, but what harm would it do to establish
dialogue with political dissidents. Let us talk to the Puerto Rican groups, the Popular
Liberation Army, MEK, Mexican Revolutionary Movement, American Front Skinheads, Phineas
Priesthood, and radical anti-abortionists. Over the past decades, these are the groups
that have been suspected of domestic terrorist acts. We know that in working with gangs
not only must they be dealt with harshly if they commit crimes, but that toxic conditions
which create their violence must be changed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let us reflect on our approach to radical anti-war groups (SDS) and the
radical civil rights groups (SNCC) in the 1970's. First, we took the route of demonizing
them, but this only played into their hands and empowered them. But then we started to
dialogue with them and began to address some of their core concerns, like poverty,
homelessness, and the de-escalation of war in Vietnam. Addressing their problems and
formulating solutions took away their anger and frustration. Now, in fact, many of them
are respected contributing members of the establishment they once abhorred.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We will not be able to solve all of the problems posed by the right and
left-wing groups that employ terrorist tactics, but we can dialogue with them and present
to them a system that is not intransigent, one-sided, and is perceived at least to be
fair. We have outstanding examples of other commissions of this sort. Let us learn from
the lessons of the past to build a better future.</p>

American Hegemony And The Embassy Bombings</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Essam Nu'man</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What happened in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam on August 9th, 1998 was a major
blow to the United States of America. Yet it came as no surprise to many who have been
wondering just how long the United States would be allowed to continue its heavy handed
policing in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Condemnation of the bombings of the two embassies was far-reaching, coming
from both enemies and friends of the United States. The most notable of these
condemnations was the statement from Iran. The Iranian government offered both
condemnation and its sympathies to the families of the victims. Iran denounced the
explosions and any action that leads to the loss of civilian lives. Tehran went even
further, saying that it hopes that an end to the chronic disease known as terrorism will
come through international cooperation. Iran's statement ironically was very similar to
the Egyptian statement. Egyptian President Mubarak called upon the international community
to &quot;draw a lesson from these explosions, and to realize the importance of serious
international cooperation to combat terrorism.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Iraq remained silent. The Iraqis were busy burying a new score of dead
children, victims of the sanctions imposed on Iraq more than seven years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, condemning terrorism is an obligation. No one should fail to
express intolerance and outrage. But combating terrorism remains a controversial issue due
to disagreement on the definition of what constitutes terrorism. For instance, the United
States and Israel label as terrorism resistance to occupation by Palestinians who are
subjected to state terrorism despite the fact that the United Nations considers opposition
to an occupying force to be a fight of the people so effected.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most religions also recognize the God-given right of every human being to
protect the right to survive, even when force is required to do so. Saint Augustine, in <i>The
City of God</i>, justified the use of force in the protection of the political community.
St. Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, who also contributed to the development of the Christian
just war theory, took Christian participation in war a step further. He argued, &quot;The
Christian third party should intervene to protect the victim and is justified in using
force against the assailant if necessary to keep harm from the victim. The force that may
be used is limited, however, by the fact that Christ died for him (the assailant) as
well.&quot;' Most people who know the details of the occupation of Palestine and who are
familiar with its brutality would consider the Palestinians the &quot;victims&quot; and
most worthy of Christian third party intervention on their behalf.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is also significant and growing disagreement on exactly how to
combat terrorism. Is it wise to launch international campaigns to combat terrorism,
despite the lack of an official agreement on what constitutes terrorism? For instance,
Israel shells Lebanese villages and kills civilians with air attacks, artillery attacks,
and bombings of villages and cities. It demolishes houses and burns up women, children,
and old people without mercy. In this case, who are the terrorists, the resistance
movement, which has launched only retaliatory attacks, or Israel, the occupier, who bombs
unarmed civilians and conducts political assassinations internationally, even using
biological weapons in one assault against a Hamas politician in one of it's allied
countries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another issue related to the bombing of the U.S embassies is the American
response. The President in his press conference sought to appear calm and confident, a
difficult task for him no doubt, considering that he was suffering from the aftermath of a
personal confession that crippled his credibility. In his statement the president said
that American embassies were targeted because of America's leading role in international
politics. To some, this statement reflected the fact that America really has not
recognized the extent to which it has become disliked, due to its unwillingness to
demonstrate real leadership. In fact, most would say that American weakness is the cause
for Israel's continuous undisciplined and unethical violations of international law. Then
there are those who see the United States itself as very arrogant in its pursuit of
hegemony over world politics. Albright, the American Secretary of State, seemed very
nervous and offensive. She said that she considered these explosions threats to American
national security. She also promised that the United States will use all means at its
disposal to punish the perpetrators of the bombings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Albright's statement is another indication that America is paying a heavy
price for its refusal to demonstrate leadership or at least control over Israel and for
its own heavy handed tactics used to enforce American/Israeli policies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, America seems completely incapable of grasping the reality of the
escalation of enmity to America worldwide. When a country's civilians and interests are
threatened as they obviously are in this case, it seems that the leadership of that
country would be asking four major questions: who are the perpetrators? what are the
reasons behind such action? how to find the perpetrators? and how to prevent future
occurrences of such actions?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In reviewing what is available to me of the American response, most US
officials have raised in their analysis all of these questions except the second one,
which concerns the reasons and motives behind such actions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabs are also required to answer such questions, not because we are
always accused of terrorism, but because, after the disappearance of Communism and the
collapse of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the United States and the
West deemed Islam and Arabs &quot;the enemy.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, it is apparent that terrorism is a global phenomenon and is
not exclusively &quot;Arabian,&quot; but we as Arabs have a share in this phenomenon.
Thus, it would be more productive to reformulate the question to Arabs and Americans alike
by asking, Why have some Muslims resorted to political violence and why are they
considered &quot;terrorists&quot;?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, political assassinations, which throughout history have always
been an instrument of political succession known to every nation, have always been one of
the instruments of political change throughout Arab history. Three out of the four
&quot;Righteous Caliphs&quot; in the dawn of Islam were assassinated. Thousands<i> </i>were
assassinated in our modern history. Terrorism in modem Western Terminology is defined as
violent resistance to the West its institutions, and its symbols. This phenomenon of
resistance has occurred recently even among Islamists because of their very diversity. In
fact,<i> </i>Islamists, Islamic groups, and nationalists have used terrorist violence,
within the Western understanding of what constitutes terrorism, against each other more
than using it against the West and its institutions. Especially after the
&quot;Catastrophe in Palestine,&quot; political violence occurred in Syria, Egypt,
Palestine, Iraq, and elsewhere. Thus, terrorism or assassination became an
&quot;internal&quot; weapon and not &quot;external.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, the West has realized the importance of Islam and its
appeal to Muslims. The West saw a need to manipulate some Muslim groups in order to
preserve the status quo and thereby maintain privileged Western interests in the region,
for example, by countering Arab radical leftists and Communists. After the Iranian
Revolution, a drastic change occurred in the way Islamists perceive themselves and their
enemies. And a dramatic change occurred in the way Islamists perceive the West as well<i>.
</i>To Islamists, nationalists are not necessarily collaborators with the West. And
alliance with conservative local regimes - the allies of the West - is not acceptable in
fighting the nationalist and democratic forces.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This evolutionary development in perceiving each other - Islamists and
nationalists continued to crystallize to the extent that the two movements abandoned their
historical enmity in the early 1990s after convening the first conference in Khartoum of
the Peoples Arab and Islamic Conference (PAIC).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At this point, and after the Second Gulf war, some Islamists resorted to
what can be classified as &quot;external violence,&quot; meaning targeting the symbols of
the West and its interests in the Arab World and elsewhere. In their resort to such means
of plain violence, they were no harder on the West than were the Nationalists, especially
the Palestinian organizations, notably the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) after the 1967 war. It is not an exaggeration to say that the 1991 defeat
represented a turning point for Islamists as much as the defeat of 1967 did for
nationalists. It marked the point of turning to violence, and in some instances to
&quot;naked violence&quot; or terrorism, as it is defined by the West, against the West
and its interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following factors can be considered as major causes of terrorism:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1) Frustration from oppression by existing Arab regimes and from the
opposition's inability to resist. Arab ideologies and politics collapsed in its challenge
to the well-unified West, which is determined to enhance its power in the region through
Israel and is determined to deter any attempt at Arab unification;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2) The escalation of a comprehensive-Zionist attack on Arab existence and
on Islamic holy shrines, and the transformation of Israel into a nuclear and regional
power able to expand and commit aggression against Arabs;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3) The total obedience of most existing Arab regimes to American wishes,
and the collaboration of such regimes with the U.S. government in crushing resistance to
Zionist colonization and American hegemony;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4) The inability of the Arab and Islamist liberation movements to express
their views on current issues through existing official channels. Some regimes have become
instruments of oppressive integration into what was called first 'the New World Order' and
lately &quot;Globalization&quot;; and</p>

<ol START="5">
  <li>Islamist discovery of the benefits from utilizing modem technology, especially
    communication technology, in special operations in some cases against Israel and its sole
    ally, the United Sates, some of which can be classified as terrorist. <br>
    <br>
    In conclusion, it is essential to say that Islamists' resort to violence, and the resort
    by Arab nationalists before them, is a result of &quot;naked aggression,&#148; terrorism,
    and violence perpetrated against them by Israel, the United States, and its Arab
    clientele, especially against Arab and Islamist liberation and resistance movements.
    Israel's establishment, existence, and its expansion is a continuous terrorism against
    Arabs and Muslims.</li>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Arab and Islamist counter-violence, however, was not successful except in
  some cases, such as the Islamic resistance in Southern Lebanon and some resistance actions
  in Palestine. Its failure and ineffectiveness are attributed to three factors:</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">1) The failure to connect such actions with an ideology or a well planned
  and studied political program that corresponds to Arab needs, interests, and national
  aspirations;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">2) Lack of a strict ethical socialization process for members of the
  resistance movement which led to loss of control. This failure led to the commission of
  violent actions against their own population whom they were supposed to assist by bringing
  social justice and defending their existence; and</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">3) Negligent planning and logistics, which reflected negatively on the
  performance of the resistance movements.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Naked terrorism&quot; is more harmful than beneficial. It is useless
  in the modern world. Like drugs, it makes people think that there are unseen powers that
  would come suddenly and change the bitter reality, thereby removing the need for
  constructive popular engagement in struggle. The two explosions in Nairobi and Dar Es
  salaam did remind America how much it is hated and targeted, but their final result helps
  Western counter-terrorism efforts more effectively combat liberation movements. Overall,
  resistance is an intellectual and a political action. It is not blind violent action to
  demand a stolen right or to highlight injustices committed against a people. The best
  examples pro and con are the shining resistance in South Lebanon and the blind experience
  in the countryside of Algeria.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">A Sense Of Justice</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Ruth Anderson</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bombs are now silent over the torn earth of Kosovo and perhaps the
Allied Forces can discard their pseudo image of concern since their sinister idea of
justice has now been served.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It would be nice if such a deep sense of justice would prevail in other
parts of the globe. It would be nicer if Americans (our world police force) had a real
sense of justice wherever injustice is an accepted way of life. Take Iraq for instance.
While the world citizens are shocked at the atrocities enacted against the ethnic Albanian
population in Kosovo, American planes bomb Iraqi targets on a intermittent basis. American
outrage at Serbian behaviour in Kosovo and American indifference to the suffering in Iraq
is not consistent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As if the bombing were not enough, the sanctions are still unmercifully
clamped down on a country that has lost a great deal of its social, political and economic
infrastructure while everywhere the ugly face of death predominates, especially among the
very young and the very old.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the rich have left the country, seeking their destinies and peace
elsewhere. Most of the poverty-stricken remaining cannot purchase their freedom or escape
from the despair and disease that lurks around every corner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not so amazingly, the Iraqi president<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> still
unscathed by all the misfortune just outside his many palaces and his abundance of money<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> continues to thrive as never before. The sanctions have not hurt
him. He can get the best doctors and food to ensure his good health and comfort.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Where then is justice? The same sense of justice that brought the Serbian
president, Slobodan Milosovic, down on his knees and hopefully might restore peace to the
Balkans is nowhere to be seen in Iraq.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A whole country cannot be punished because of the actions of a single man.
Though America led the bombing in Yugoslavia, who will foot the bill for reconstruction?
Perhaps that gigantic bill will be passed off onto the other NATO forces. But what about
every personal tragedy that has struck families across the country regardless of ethnic or
religious ties? Who will dry the tears of the orphans, the widows and the maimed? And
while no one can condone Serbian atrocities against the Muslim populations all over the
Yugoslav provinces, neither can anyone condone the brutal and vicious NATO bombings
wherever they have occurred.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And though &#147;ethnic cleansing&#148; may have been halted in the
Balkans, America has its own form of such cleansing in Iraq. In fact, it looks more like
genocide than just ethnic cleansing. It is ludicrous to think that the American intentions
in Iraq are or were to root out President Saddam Hussein or coerce the Iraqi people to
overthrow him. Possibly nowhere on earth is a rebellion against a leadership more
impossible than in Iraq. Secret police dressed in civilian clothes are everywhere and
their job is to spy on anyone they feel threatens national security. And no one would
believe how low their standards are for acts they consider a threat to national security.
Torture and death are standard methods of curbing any desire to change the present
government and leader. People live in a constant state of fear, for they are not allowed
to speak out against Saddam&#146;s injustice, nor express the idea that the sanctions and
bombings can in a sense be partially blamed on him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Regretfully, since the sanctions have been imposed, more than 1 million
Iraqi citizens have died. Also, diseases such as inflammation of the respiratory system,
diarrhea, malnutrition, high blood pressure, diabetes and malignant tumors are among the
causes of death according to the official Iraqi News Agency. There has also been a marked
increase in communicable diseases such as polio, whooping cough, measles, cholera and
others in comparison to the pre-Gulf war days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As if life is not depressing enough, U.S. fighter jets bombed a military
command centre in northern Iraq recently after Iraqi forces fired on the planes in the
northern no-fly zone. Air Force F-15s and F-16s attacked a military command post northwest
of Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad. This was the second attack on an Iraqi
command site that was reported by American military sources.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">American and British warplanes have been enforcing the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq since the end of the Gulf war in 1991. But Iraq does not
recognize the zones and since December 1998 has challenged allied planes that fly there.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There must be an end to the sanctions and bombings in Iraq. It is inhumane
and inconceivable that the American-led NATO forces express such concern over ethnic
cleansing in the Balkans and yet the American government practices it in Iraq. There is a
dire need for an international standard of justice and of what is right and wrong, and
these guidelines should determine international action and reaction regardless of
geographical location or the ethnic and racial heritage of the occupants of any particular
place. It is not right to kill Arabs simply because they are Arabs or because huge oil
reserves are exploited in Arab locations, or to placate the whims of Zionists. </p>
