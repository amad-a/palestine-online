<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser Arafat, the controversial chairman of the PLO and the President of
the Palestinian Authority (PA), continues to score one failure after the other. Indeed,
the Chairman's record can be said to amount to a series of fiascoes and fat zeros. Ever
since he was allowed to return to parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip (in the shadow of
Israeli rifles), he has proved that he is virtually powerless to attain any worthwhile
achievement for the Palestinian people. Aside from his rich rhetorical overindulgence,
Arafat has utterly failed to provide his people with a glimmer of hope or a flicker of
light at the end of the tunnel. This fiasco, which the Chairman ignores and pretends
doesn't exist (he even urges the masses to glorify it as a &quot;great national
achievement), manifested itself recently on the &quot;the day of anger&quot; when the
Palestinian masses refused to heed Arafat's call to take to the streets to protest against
the expansion of Jewish settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This didn't mean, of course, that the masses were coming to terms with the
grabbing of their land by Zionist thieves (the settlers), nor did it mean that the people
were getting tired of struggle. But it did mean that they were getting fed up with a
leader who presides over an inherently corrupt entity that treats the Palestinians as
&quot;subjects&quot; rather than &quot;citizens.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, how could the masses possibly believe that Arafat was serious
about combating settlement expansion when his security and intelligence collaboration with
the Zionists is never touched!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, why would the Zionists, whether Netanyahu or Barak, be a bit
worried or concerned about this futile sabre-rattling on Arafat's part while they receive
virtually all they need and demand from him quietly and with or without the &quot;day of
anger&quot;?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, &quot;the day of anger&quot; and similar feats by Arafat
are first and last meant more for Palestinian public consumption than for pressuring the
Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, everybody knows, acts virtually as a quisling in the service of
the Zionists. He keeps hundreds of Palestinians behind bars for prolonged periods of time
without charge or trial. The reason&#133;to appease Israel and the CIA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat has also virtually killed the Palestinian justice system, and
degraded the status and stature of jurists, judges and lawyers, again to be able to serve
the Zionists effectively without facing any legal hurdles. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the Chairman believes the Palestinian question has, for the most
part, been resolved. Thus, he declared a few months ago that &quot;we are already
practicing Statehood in reality!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there is more to the Palestinian people's disillusionment with Arafat
and his authority. Many, probably most, Palestinians have come to feel that the PA is not
&quot;their&quot; authority, but somebody else's authority. This feeling is reinforced and
confirmed on a daily basis in the streets and neighbourhoods of the West Bank and Gaza
towns where the &quot;President's men&quot; are acting like the biggest drug cartel in
Central American. The new lavish red marble-tiled high-rises, whether along the Gaza shore
or at the hilltops of Ramallah, leave no doubt as to where the money goes&#133;at a time
when the public health system is on the verge of collapse!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This aside, Arafat is now awaiting the &quot;new saviour&quot;. He is
General Ehud Barak, who some gullible Arab leaders believe will send the &quot;larks of
peace&quot; hovering over the Middle East. In fact, Arafat himself didn't hesitate to urge
Israel's new premier to &quot;emulate Rabin,&quot; the former Israeli Prime Minister who
ordered his soldiers to break the bones of Palestinian children during the intifadah, the
same person who wished the sea would inundate the Gaza Strip &quot;once and for all.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Barak is not going to act in accordance with Arafat's wishes.
Certainly, he will not accept Arafat's &quot;conception&quot; of the peace process, e.g.
that it should lead to the implementation of UN resolutions 242 and 338 and Israeli
withdrawal from the entirety of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Barak has made it amply clear that his approach to
&quot;peace&quot; with the Palestinians doesn't differ substantially from that of
Netanyahu. What can the Palestinians do to forestall this grand treachery? The
Palestinians must raise their voices against this expected sell-out. They must start to
take immediate action to depose this leadership of Arafat using electoral means. Arafat's
&quot;presidential term&quot;, after all, has already expired, and it is time the
Palestinians elect a new leadership. </font></p>
