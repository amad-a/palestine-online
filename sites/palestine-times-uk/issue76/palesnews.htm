<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas: Israeli intelligence is behind assassination</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>attempt in Amman</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has accused Israeli
intelligence of master-minding an assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al,
the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, that took place in Amman the morning
of 25 September.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Hamas leader and spokesman in Gaza, Dr. Abdul Aziz al
Rantisi said he had no doubt whatsoever about the identity of the perpetrators,
saying &quot;Khalid Misha'al has one and only one enemy in this world and
that is the Zionist criminals.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Rantisi said in a telephone interview from his Gaza home
on the afternoon following the incident that he would not like to be hasty
in drawing conclusions, adding that if indeed it turned out that Israeli
agents were behind the assassination attempt, it would mean that Israel
has &quot;chosen to open wide a new door of confrontation with Muslims everywhere.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Another Islamist spokesman, who asked for anonymity, said
&quot;Israel is playing with fire, and fire doesn't burn only Islamist leaders.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al's life reportedly
took place as he was on his way to work in Amman.  According to Islamist
sources in the Jordanian capital, the incident was preceded by Mr. Misha'al
sensing that he was being followed by an unidentified car carrying five
men.  Upon reaching his destination and alighting from his vehicle, two
of the men from the unfamiliar car were close behind him as he reached the
entrance of his building.   As they got closer to him, he noticed that one
of the men was carrying a small, unidentified device which the assailant
attempted to deploy close to Mr. Misha'al's ear.  However, one of the two
security guards looking after Mr. Misha'al was able to strike the assailant's
arm just before detonation.  There was a loud noise and a sort of electric
shock that made Mr. Misha'al lose his sense of balance.  It is still unknown
what the effect of this device would have been had the detonation been complete
and without interference.  The two men attempted to flee the scene but were
captured by the security guards who subdued them until the arrival of the
police and their eventual arrest.  The other three accomplices escaped in
their vehicle.  According to the security guards, all five are believed
to be non-Arab nationals.  In the interim, Mr. Misha'al was rushed to hospital
and is still under observation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Earlier this month, the internal Israeli ministerial council
on security adopted a number of secret recommendations against Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to Israeli sources, the recommendations included
&quot;reactivating Mossad death squads in Jordan,&quot; an allusion to carrying
out assassinations of Islamist leaders in Jordan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Two years ago, the murder of the Palestinian Islamist
guerrilla Yahya Ayyash by the Israeli intelligence sparked off a series
of deadly urban bomb attacks in Israel in which over 100 Israeli soldiers
and civilians were killed.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel is launching a war on Islam</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation troops raided last month the Grand Mosque
in Dura in the latest attack on Islamic holy places in the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to local Palestinian sources, scores of Israeli
soldiers forcibly entered the Mosque shortly after midnight Sunday, 21 September
presumably to carry out searches for &quot;inciting materials.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Mosque Muezzin, Ja'afar Dasseh, said the soldiers
behaved with obvious disrespect inside the Mosque and stepped on copies
of the Qur'an.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	He added that the commanding officer then produced a poorly
written closure order saying that the Mosque, the largest in the Hebron
area, be closed off for one month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Sheikh Salah al Natshe, Head of the Hebron Wakf Department,
strongly condemned the Israeli army transgression against Islamic holy places.
 &quot;When somebody writes graffiti at a Jewish grave in a remote part
of Europe or North America, they make a big fuss about it; however, when
their murderous soldiers and settlers desecrate Muslim mosques and Christian
churches, nobody says anything.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Natshe pointed out that Israeli army attacks on Islamic
holy places in the West Bank have assumed phenomenal proportions of late.
 He said Israeli raids on mosques and their imams have become &quot;almost
a daily occurrence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;The matter is simply a dirty war by Jews on Islam,
the Qur'an and the holy prophet.&quot;  Muhammed Ayyash, a clerk at the
Bethlehem Wakf Department, concurred.  He pointed out that the Israeli army
has arrested many local imams in the villages of Tku, al Khader, Beit Fajjar
and the Dheisheh refugee camp in the last two weeks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ayyash admitted that the vindictive arrests were undermining
the holding of prayers at the respective mosques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On 21 September, as many as 600 Israeli soldiers raided
the village of Asira al Shamaliyya near Nablus.  Assa'ad Sawalmeh, head
of the local council, said the heavily-armed soldiers raided homes, beat
up defenseless villagers and arrested scores of youth for &quot;harbouring
Islamic tendencies.&quot;  Sawalmeh pointed out that the Israeli troops,
commanded by Uzi Dayyan (Israeli army commander in the West Bank) forced
as many as 600 local citizens into the local school where they subjected
them to various forms of humiliation and occasional beatings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the meantime, the Israeli troops confined Palestinian
Authority policemen to their local centre, preventing them from leaving
the premises &quot;until further notice.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Israeli operation at the village lasted for more than
12 hours, and as many as 25 local citizens were arrested. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Violent Attack on Muslim Charity in France
</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>British Muslim groups fear for safety</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	<B>London- PT</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>British Muslims condemned the 9 September attack which
targeted the Paris offices of the Muslim charity Comit&eacute; de Bienfaisance
pour la Solidarit&eacute; avec la Palestine (CBSP). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A press release issued by British Muslim organizations
said that the CBSP is one of the four charities currently being targeted
by the Israeli government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;One worker was in the office when six men of European
appearance and speaking French approached the offices. Two stayed outside
whilst four entered the premises and sprayed the worker with CS Gas just
before two of them brutally assaulted him. The other two assailants sprayed
graffiti on the walls, including several Stars of David with the initials
GSC written below.  GSC are known in the Middle East as the 'Zionist Action
Group,' and have claimed responsibility for the attack. They are equated
with the Jewish Defence League, who are active in the UK and USA.  The GSC
have been becoming more active in Europe,&quot; said the press release.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Muslim groups in Britain expressed concern over possible
attacks on Muslim charities in the UK by Jewish extremists. &quot;British
Muslim organizations are concerned that they are even more vulnerable to
attack. A few weeks ago, some Muslim organizations were warned by New Scotland
Yard to expect such attacks. When one of the charities contacted wrote to
the Home Secretary Jack Straw requesting to discuss security, they were
refused a meeting,&quot; they said.  They wondered if the British government,
in the light of this latest incident, would provide security for Muslim
organizations and charities, &quot;as it already does to its Jewish counterparts.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The UN Partition Plan Remembered</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Much is made of how Israel &quot;accepted&quot; the United
Nations Partition Plan, and the Arabs rejected it, thus launching a wave
of anti-Arab propaganda that has haunted the debate over Palestinian rights
for half a century.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The argument, offered by the Israelis, goes something
like this: Israel compromised and accepted half of British Mandated Palestine.
The Palestinians and Arabs rejected the compromise causing the events of
their loss that followed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It's not quite like that, though. And, it didn't start
on Nov. 29, 1947 when the UN General Assembly barely approved the Partition
Resolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In fact, the real vote occurred on September 8, 1947 when
the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) released a controversial
report calling for the Partition of Palestine. Dissenting members of UNSCOP
endorsed a &quot;Federal Solution&quot; in which Jews and Arabs would manage
Palestine together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But why was Partition recommended?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Haganah forces had already laid out a detailed plan to
occupy the majority of Mandated Palestine and had been given advance information
on British Plans to depart. In fact, they had assurances from the British,
the United States that the State of Israel would receive international recognition
and the backing of the United Nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Haganah was receiving arms and men from Europe and
with the help of the British and also the Americans, while the British maintained
a nearly airtight blockade of Arab volunteers trying to stream into Palestine
to fight with Palestinian irregulars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In contrast, armies from neighboring Arab States were
prohibited from entering Palestine by the British, while armed Jewish volunteers
streamed in under the watchful eye of the British. (On March 24, 1947, the
Arab League accused Britain and the US of interfering and blamed them for
the deteriorating conditions.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But Israel needed the partition plan and knew in advance
that it was unacceptable to the Arabs because Arab allies on UNSCOP had
led the opposition during committee debates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It was very simple. If Israel accepted the Partition and
the Arabs did not, Israel would be free to continue its aggressive military
land grab. If the Israelis accepted &quot;Federation,&quot; they would be
forced to halt their military advances and give up hope of an Independent
State.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Meeting in Sofar, Lebanon Sept. 16th through the 19th,
the Arab League did what Jewish leaders expected, they denounced the UNSCOP
Partition Plan. The Arab League made a strong argument, pointing out the
so-called &quot;Jewish State&quot; consisted of a majority of Christian
and Muslim Palestinians. The unworkable plan proposed dividing Palestine
into six separate regions. The &quot;Jewish&quot; and &quot;Arab&quot; states
would each consist of three intersecting segments, looking like a six square
chess board with one side having black squares and the other with red squares.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On Sept. 26, British Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech
Jones announced that the British Mandate would terminate. The deadline of
May 14 was not publicly announced until one month later, although the Jewish
leadership already knew the date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On Sept. 29, 1947, the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine,
which had only been recently allowed to return to Palestine after a 10 year
exile, announced it would reject the UNSCOP Partition Plan. They endorsed
the Federation plan that recognized Palestine's independence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Jewish Agency had privately rejected Federation, but
waited until the Arab Side announced their position first, before telling
the world they would &quot;accept&quot; Partition, announcing it on Oct.
2, 1947. American endorsement came on Oct. 11.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Arab critics accused the Jewish Agency of insincerity,
charging Haganah forces were already advancing on dozens of Palestinian
Villages in and out of the proposed Partition Plan areas assigned to the
&quot;Jewish State.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Politically at the United Nations, the Jewish Agency had
won its battle for perception, falsely claiming at the United Nations podium
during debates that followed that they, the Jews in Palestine, had endorsed
compromise and the Arabs had rejected it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	That public posture allowed them to continue to attack
Arab villages without condemnation from their American or British supporters,
who kept the United Nations deadlocked on resolution after resolution introduced
to denounce the Haganah and Irgun attacks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On November 29, 1947, with some minor modifications, the
UN voted to recommend the Partition Plan, approving it by a vote of slim
margin of 33 votes, with 13 voting against, 10 abstaining in protest, and
the entire Arab delegation walking out in protest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This concept of having rejected &quot;compromise&quot;
has haunted the public posture of the Arabs and Palestinians, and undermined
all future Arab efforts to justify its case against an unfair Partition
Plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	With no one to complain, Jewish forces stepped up their
military occupation of Arab villages and land outside of the proposed Jewish
State area. They had priorities: rid the proposed Jewish areas of Arabs
to make the Jewish population a the Jewish population a &quot;MAJORITY by
force,&quot; and to capture additional land to make the state defensible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Haganah forces launched battles in Jaffa and Safad, targeting
Arab residents there, and stepped up their attacks and terrorist bombings
in Jerusalem, which was designated as an &quot;International Zone&quot;
outside of both proposed states.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Examples of pre-Independence assaults on Arab villages
by the Haganah included: Abu Kebir, (Jaffa), Dec. 6; Tireh (Haifa), Dec.
13; Khisas (Safad), Dec 19; Qazaza (Ramleh), Dec. 20; Jerusalem, Dec. 29;
Balad al-Sheikh (Haifa), Dec. 30; Abu Shusha, Jan. 3, 1948; Shafa Amr (Haifa)
and Tamra (Nazareth), Jan. 19; Sukreir (Gaza), Jan, 26; Sa'Sa (Safed), Feb
14; Biyar and Ads (Jaffa), March 5.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Meanwhile, US President Harry Truman played a deceptive
game of politics that favored the Jewish forces: On March 18, 1948, Truman
met secretly with Chaim Weizmann at the White House and pledged US support
for Jewish independence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In a deceptive move the next day, Truman's UN representative
called for a suspension of the Partition Plan and endorsed an UN Supervised
truce to work out a &quot;Trusteeship&quot; to replace Partition. On March
20, The Arab League endorsed the trusteeship idea, proposing a cessation
of hostilities. But that day, Weizmann and the Jewish Agency rejected Trusteeship
and any hope of a real peace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In that light, the Jewish attack against Deir Yassin on
April 9, 1948 where 254 civilians were murdered, was intentional. Irgun
forces, in a plan supported at first by the Haganah, distributed Arabic
leaflets in Jerusalem warning other Arabs of a similar fate. Dozens of captured
villagers were paraded through Jerusalem's Jewish Sector on an open truck.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Victims of Jewish ethnic cleansing languish
in homelessness</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Hundreds of Palestinian victims of the Israeli policy
of ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem have entered their second month at
a makeshift refugee camp at the Suwwana neighbourhood, across from the Mount
of Olives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The camp, say Palestinians, only epitomizes the increasingly
acute ordeal of Jerusalemite Arabs whom the Israelis seek to drive out &quot;by
hook or by crook&quot; in order to check Arab population growth in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Today, the &quot;Jerusalem Camp of Steadfastness&quot;
is &quot;home&quot; to as many as 70 Palestinian families, including at
least 35 children below the age of eight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	So far, the Israeli municipal authorities have behaved
totally callously towards the refugees, refusing to &quot;recognize the
camp&quot; or provide refugees with electricity and water supplies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, Israeli callousness does not seem to deter the
refugees or weaken their resolve.  &quot;We are here to demonstrate to the
whole world the racist, Nazi nature of the Israeli authorities who refuse
to treat us as human beings,&quot; said Um Ahmed, a woman refugee at the
camp.  &quot;Look! They just don't want us to be in Jerusalem because we
are not Jews...It is like the Nazis who wanted to have a pure Arian Germany.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Another woman, Maha Jayyousi, cited a different reason
for becoming a refugee in her own town.  &quot;For 15 years my husband and
I have been trying to obtain a building license from the Israeli municipal
authorities, but to no avail...they told us 'if you don't like it, you can
leave the town...and we will help you leave if and when you decide to do
so',&quot; she said.  Jayyousi recognized that life in Jerusalem is difficult
and that things are particularly difficult for the children.  &quot;Life
here is difficult, but being contiguous to Jerusalem makes us forget all
hardship.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Virtually all refugees vow to stay at the camp until &quot;our
just demands are met.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;We are not asking for the impossible...we just want
to be treated on equal footing with other human beings,&quot; said Waheed
al Resheq,  pointing out to his married son Muhammed, also a refugee whose
residency rights had been withdrawn by the Israeli interior ministry.  &quot;See,
they took away his identity card because he lived for six months at the
Ram outskirts after  he couldn't find housing in East Jerusalem.&quot; 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Abdullah Burqan, another refugee at the camp, voices essentially
the same grievances.  &quot;The Israelis have one goal, that it is to force
us out of Jerusalem; and since they can't just collectively expel us outside
the town for public relations considerations, they create a situation in
which our life in the town becomes unbearable, so that we would leave <I>voluntarily.</I>&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The refugees hope that media coverage of their plight
would prompt Israel to reconsider its stance on their cause. However, this
does not seem to be forthcoming.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel alleges arrest of Hamas military cell</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The Israeli
General Security Service (Shabak) said they arrested a military cell for
Hamas which was planning to carry out &quot;serious&quot; attacks on Israeli
targets. Radio Israel quoted a source of Shabak as saying that members of
the cell proposed to bomb the biggest commercial centre in West Jerusalem,
&quot;Kanyon Malkha&quot;, and to kidnap the terrorist Ehud Olmert, the
Israeli mayor of Jerusalem. The source added that Hamas militants planned
to commit several suicide bombings simultaneously at several locations within
the commercial centre such as a cinema and some crowded shops.  Another
Israeli source of Shabak told the Israeli TV that Hamas &quot;is planning
to paralyze life in Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On the other hand, Karmi Gelon, a former chief of Shabak
predicted a &quot;disastrous&quot; future for the &quot;State of Israel.&quot;
He added that nobody should doubt that Hamas is now preparing and will always
be prepared for future suicide bombings. &quot;I am sure that there are
many dangerous Hamas cells which have not yet been discovered&quot;, said
Gelon, adding that Hamas is continuously and markedly developing the work
of its armed cells which makes it difficult for the Israelis to predict
the nature of its future operations.</FONT></P>

premise be evacuated and replaced by 10 students belonging to the ultra-fanatic
Gush Emunim movement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israeli sources described the new settlers as &quot;potential
murderers&quot; and &quot;indoctrinated in hate of everything Arab.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestinians at all levels flatly rejected the &quot;silly
joke,&quot; labelling it as &quot;a deal between thieves.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Faisal Husseini, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in
the Palestinian Authority, described the &quot;deal&quot; as &quot;a naked
trick&quot; and &quot;a crime greater than its predecessor.&quot;  PA minister
of Information, Yasser Abed Rabbu, said the &quot;Jewish-Jewish deal&quot;
was like an understanding between &quot;field gangsters and Mafia heads.&quot;
 Abed Rabbu denounced the American stance on the matter, saying it provided
a political cover for colonialist Jewish activities in Arab Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Earlier, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat rejected the deal between
the Netanyahu government and settler leaders.  &quot;This is a big trick,
a public relations ploy to perpetuate Jewish colonialism at Ras al Amud,&quot;
Arafat reportedly told a meeting of  the Arab League foreign ministers in
Cairo on Saturday, 20 September.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Meanwhile, Jewish settler leaders lauded the &quot;deal&quot;
as &quot;a victory for our cause.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;The families have left; the people who remained
are here to guard the property and make renovations because at some point
the families will come back here...this is only temporary,&quot; said settler
leader Hagit Harel, a spokesman for the group of settlers who seized the
building last week.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Another settler, Shimon Gaznov, said he and five fellow
settlers planned to get to work soon on putting up partitions and laying
ceramic tiles.  More Palestinian protests are planned outside the premise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On 20 September, Palestinian schoolchildren in East Jerusalem
staged a demonstration demanding &quot;the removal of settlers from our
midst.&quot;  Moreover, Palestinian leaders vowed to continue their protests
until the Israeli government removes the settlers for good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In another development, Palestinian Islamist sources discounted
Israeli claims concerning the apprehension of two armed Islamic cells in
East Jerusalem.  An Islamist source in the West Bank town of Hebron said
the Israeli claims to that effect &quot;were fraught with exaggeration&quot;
and &quot;aimed at boosting the morale of the Israeli public following recent
bombings in West Jerusalem and Israeli army losses in South Lebanon.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On 19 September, the Israeli intelligence service (Shabak)
disclosed that two Hamas and Islamic Jihad cells had been captured and that
members of the first cell had planned to kidnap West Jerusalem mayor Ehud
Olmert.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians lambaste Albright; PA ambivalent</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- Special for PT </FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> While most Palestinians reacted negatively to U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the region, PA officials chose to
be more circumspect, awaiting the outcome of further Israeli-Palestinian
talks slated to take place in Washington later this month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat  said Albright's
maiden visit to the region was a positive development in itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, the Palestinian leader seems to be postponing
judgment on the merits of Albright's visit &quot;until we know how things
will unfold in a few weeks to come.&quot;<B> </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Chief Palestinian negotiator, Sa'eb Ereikat, told the
Palestinian Legislative Council on 16 September that &quot;there was still
a wide gap between the Palestinian and American perception of the current
crisis, its causes, and ways and means to revive the peace process.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ereikat said there was a conspicuous dichotomy between
&quot;our views and those of Mrs. Albright on the concept of security and
terrorism,&quot; adding that it was clear that Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu &quot;uses the security issue as an excuse to renege on the peace
process.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ereikat disclosed that PA Chairman Yasser Arafat handed
Albright a list of 150 Palestinians murdered cold-bloodedly by Israeli soldiers
and settlers since Oslo without the perpetrators being charged or tried.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	He disclosed that Albright and Arafat indulged in &quot;a
long and acrimonious argument&quot; over the role of Palestinian police
in preventing and thwarting violence against Israeli targets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;The president told her 'I don't receive orders from
anybody',&quot; said Ereikat, alluding to Albright's incessant demands that
the Palestinian Authority &quot;clamp down on the infrastructure of Hamas
and the Islamic Jihad.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Arafat's media adviser Marwan Kanafani intimated
that the PA Chairman rejected Albright's demands that the &quot;PA mount
an all-out campaign&quot; against the Islamist infrastructure within the
autonomous enclaves. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to Kanafani, Arafat asked Albright if she  would
guarantee that the U.S. Congress would not  place the PA on the list of
states violating human rights should he heed her demands to that effect.
 Kanafani said Albright was reticent when Arafat told her he couldn't put
people behind bars just because Mr. Netanyahu felt like it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Other Palestinian officials lashed out at Albright for
the stark obliquity inherent in her &quot;overemphasis on Israeli security
requirements, while only making a passing and half-hearted allusion to Jewish
settlement expansion in Jerusalem and the West Bank.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Albright's imbalance is stark, blunt and scandalous.
She amply and unashamedly demonstrated her emotional identification and
political solidarity with Israel. She simply can't be the honest, impartial
and even-handed broker that she should be,&quot; said PA Minister of Information
Yasser Abed Rabbu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Many Palestinians  were particularly incensed by Albright's
statements on the &quot;Voice of Palestine&quot; and later at the &quot;American
Friends School in Ramallah&quot; on Friday, 12 September, in which she claimed
that &quot;Hamas and the Islamic Jihad were the main enemy of the average
Palestinian.&quot;  Albright opined that &quot;Hamas actions against Israel
caused Israeli reactions against the Palestinians.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the first case, questions were not allowed, and at
the Ramallah school, only 20 pupils were carefully selected to be the audience
 and the questions submitted to Albright were meticulously chosen by officials
of the American Consulate in East Jerusalem, ostensibly to rule out &quot;provocative
questions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	One Palestinian student, who listened to Albright's speech
at the Friends School, marvelled at &quot;the American lady's incredible
perception of things in this part of the world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;So, Mrs. Albright would like us to believe that
Hamas, not Israel, is destroying Palestinian homes, stealing Palestinian
land,  conspiring against the Al-Aqsa Mosque and narrowing Palestinians'
horizons,&quot; the student said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian opposition figures criticized the PA for not
allowing a response to her &quot;shocking charade.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Both Albright and the PA insulted the Palestinian
people. First, Albright had the audacity to tell us that Hamas, not Netanyahu,
was our enemy; and second, the PA allowed the wicked lady to get away with
her incredible lies without allowing the victim to challenge the oppressor,&quot;
said Sheikh Yousef Ibrahim, an Islamist figure in al Beireh near Ramallah.

detainee to death</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Israeli intelligence agents have tortured a 31-year-old
Palestinian political detainee to death, Israeli and Palestinian sources
said on Wednesday, 17 September.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The detainee, Marwan Hasan Ibrahim Ma'ali of the village
of <I>A'jja</I> near Jenin, was strangled to death at the hands of three
Israeli Shabak interrogators at the Megiddo detention camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	An Israeli army spokesman said Ma'ali died in &quot;vague
circumstances&quot; and &quot;may have committed suicide.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, a number of his friends reportedly denied the
Israeli claim of a possible suicide saying that &quot;it was a routine ruse
to conceal the crime.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Marwan didn't commit suicide; he was murdered by
the criminal thugs&quot; said one inmate from Hebron, referring to Shabak
interrogators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to his family, Ma'ali had no mental or psychological
problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	His friend, Ragheb, from A'jja flatly denied the Israeli
insinuation that Ma'ali committed suicide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Why would he commit suicide? He was in good health;
he was married and a father of three children, and had no social or psychological
problems,&quot; said Ragheb.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Isa Karaqe'i, head of the Palestinian Prisoner's Club
said &quot;I'm 100% sure that Shabak agents murdered Marwan...He was not
the kind of person who would commit suicide.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;This (the suicide claim) is not the first, nor will
it be the last claim of its kind by those evil murderers...They always perpetrate
their crimes and then seek to conceal them in a variety of sinister ways.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group,
Ma'ali was arrested on 4 August following the 31 July bombing in West Jerusalem.
An administrative detention order for two months was issued for him. His
family was not allowed to visit him despite an illness that Ma'ali suffered
from. The family tried to pass medical documents related to the illness
through the Red Cross without success.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ma'ali's body was taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute
for an autopsy. He was due to be buried Wednesday night at his village.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ma'ali was detained without charge or trial like so many
other Palestinians currently held hostage by the Israeli government; they
know not why they are being detained or if and when they would be let go.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ma'ali leaves behind him a pregnant wife and three children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israel is the only country in the world that legalizes
the use of torture against detainees. So far, as many as 15 Palestinians
died of torture in Israeli custody since the signing of the Oslo agreement
four years ago.  </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Roots of terror</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Off a main road north of Jerusalem is the Palestinian village
of Bani Samuel. In August, Israeli troops stormed into the tiny village
and demolished four &quot;unlicensed&quot; homes belonging to residents
who trace their family roots to the area back hundreds of years.  This place
sits on the highest mountain around Jerusalem and is the site of the Tomb
of Samuel the Prophet, who is sacred to Moslems and Jews. Only 200 Palestinians
are left in the village, and you have to pass a gated military base surrounding
the Mosque, which has been forcibly turned into a Synagogue, and then drive
past the home of a local Arab collaborator, who does much of the dirty deeds
for the Israeli intelligence and occupation authorities against his own
people. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is only getting past these obstacles can you enter this
ancient town to see where four homes now lie now in a heap of rubble. A
lawyer, Mohammed Barakat, who is now a quadriplegic from an auto accident
in Jordan a few years back, describes the story of his poor village:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In 1971, the Israelis destroyed all of our homes
surrounding the mosque, which was the old part of the village, and forced
us to move in to these homes about 200 meters away. These are homes that
were abandoned by people who fled to Jordan in June  of 1967.  Since then,
the Israelis have not given us a single permit to build on our  own land.
 In 1967 there where maybe five persons to a house.  Now we are nearly 
20 people trying to live in a modest home. And still, we have not been permitted
to build a single room here. This is a policy designed to force us to leave
our village. We are living on a high mountain and a holy site, so they do
not want any Arabs here and are using many methods to get us to leave. The
soldiers from the base always come and harass us, checking I.D.s and humiliating
the youths in front of the people. We have no services either. There is
no school, so we have to send our children to nearby villages. We applied
for a permit for a driver to take the children to school in a bus, but this
was denied. They have to take a local bus, and then walk in the heat or
rain for a kilometer from where it leaves them to the school. We do not
have a clinic or public facility here  for anyone to use and there are no
phones. We tried to fix the roads, but this too was denied. In the four
homes that were destroyed last week, 23 people are now homeless. Many more
are affected, but some are away in Jordan and others are back living in
the cramped conditions of their previous situation. 23 people, however,
are living in tents supplied by the Red Cross. The army came at 9:00 am,
told the people they have five minutes to remove their things and bulldozed
the homes. Many people lost valuables.  You will see now when you tour the
area clothes, food and other items in the rubble.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I did not interrupt the man as he spoke.  Too few journalists
are willing to come and hear his story, and he was eager to  express himself.
 Even among the Palestinians a few miles away in Ramallah, there is little
knowledge of Bani Samuel and its plight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The objective of this government is to put pressure
on the people. They want us to leave, to go from this spot, our land, so
they can further build their own settlements. Just down the mountain, go,
look there, you will see the construction of Ramot, a settlement that was
build on our land 10 years ago. They have all of the services we lack. 
Roads, schools, clinics, phones, and space. No permits are denied there.
Their children play in parks that are my father's olive trees. Netanyahu
tells the Americans that this building is only to address the issue of 'natural
growth', but where is our natural growth? We have families here living five
persons in a kitchen.  They sleep, eat and live in a single room.  People
became fed up and built a new room without permission, which would never
come, and the army came and destroyed that room.  This is the situation
we are facing. We have our land, our rights, but this government will not
release us. We want peace. We are against the bombs and terror, but what
is the cause of this terror.  Look at those children who are seeking their
toys in the rubble of their home.  What do you think they are going to believe
when they grow older about peace?  This is the real terrorism. Demolishing
some one's home on their own land because they want space to raise a family.
 Netanyahu speaks of democracy and peace, but these are just slogans. It
means nothing.  And the Americans, your country, is also to blame.  We ask
any sponsor of peace to be fair, to not take the sides of someone and to
recognize oppression, but from the Untied States we just get more warnings
about terrorism.  This is the cause of violence, especially at a time when
we are asking to live in peace.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I went down to visit the four families living in the Red
Cross tents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You journalists just come and write things, but never
write about a solution. What is the point talking to you?&quot;  Asks one
man, whose family of four now share a tent the size of a small room.  When
I tell him that it is not the objective of a journalist to offer solutions,
he snorts and goes on smoking quietly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We want peace,&quot; says another man. &quot;But
you cannot have it under these conditions. Tomorrow, Peace Now will come
from Israel and hold a demonstration with us against this policy of destroying
our homes, but what will it do? They are powerless to stop their own leaders
from taking us closer to war.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are sick of fighting,&quot; Mohammed Barakat,
the crippled lawyer, tells me before we leave. &quot;This peace agreement
was to say enough. Enough killing and suffering and pain for everyone. 
But this government of Netanyahu is pushing us everyday to the point of
returning to the armed struggle. When you see your land and rights being
taken and you have tried the path of peace and it failed, what other options
remain for you to find a way to survive on your own land?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As I drove out of Bani Samuel, on to the main road to Jerusalem,
dozens of new Israeli cars roared past, on to expensive homes in the Ramot
settlement. They are completely oblivious to the situation or conditions
in a place just over the hill in Bani Samuel. Until it is clear that the
key to peace is the fulfillment of basic rights for everyone, there will
never be lasting peace here. Unfortunately, the drums of war are beating
louder. With each new home demolition in the West Bank and every new settlement,
another youth will see the path of suicide bombs as the only language that
Netanyahu and his cronies understand.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>CARE: Advances in Palestinian Education</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Most of us in the free world consider education to be
extremely vital to live, and we are always trying to improve its quality.
 However, we take it for granted. We forget sometimes that not everyone
in the world can get a good education or even an education at all. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In Palestine, the occupation has been very hard on popular
education.  During the intifadah, as well as during closures in other periods
of time, schools and universities were closed.  Those students had no place
to study.  They used to gather in basements to study together.  One  time
the United Nations sent school books to the Palestinian children, but the
Israelis refused to give them the books.  It is sad when a people are prevented
from getting the education that they desire. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the midst of the intifidah and its troubled, chaotic
time, an organization sprang up in Jerusalem.  This organization, the Center
of Applied Research in Education (CARE), was established in 1988 to take
charge of popular education during the intifidah.  It still exists and is
currently continuing with new projects. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The director of CARE, Ghassan Abdullah, spoke to me at
the Popular Jerusalem Conference to tell me more about CARE and its work.
 CARE is not only for Jerusalem, but for all of Palestine.  However, lately
there has been more of a concentration in Jerusalem.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Mr. Ghassan told me that CARE began in 1994  as a &quot;Jerusalem
and Education&quot; campaign.  He stated that &quot;This program takes several
approaches:  round-table, seminars and training sessions that deal with
how to present in education the history and geography of Jerusalem.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	He went on to tell me about two of their big achievements.
 The first is the fact that CARE has produced visual aides for teaching
about Jerusalem through fun, which was sponsored by the Islamic Organization
for Cultural and Educational Affairs.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Their second achievement is a collection of short stories
that is directed towards raising awareness about the issue of Jerusalem.
 These stories were written by prominent Palestinian scholars, and the target
audience is Palestinian and other Arab children.  Mr. Ghassan stated that
one of their goals is &quot;to focus on an Islamic and an Arab identity.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The General Assembly of the Islamic Organization, which
is located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, held the 6th Annual Conference about
Jerusalem in education on 5 and 6 July of this year.  174 educationalists
from the 1948 Palestinian areas, the West Bank and Gaza attended.  Mr. Ghassan
said that &quot;For two days we discussed the strategy and methodology of
getting Jerusalem into education.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	CARE focuses on helping teachers and students as well
as helping to teach parent councils how to operate.  &quot;We are trying
to take practical steps to improve the educational situation,&quot; says
Mr. Ghassan.  &quot;We hold training sessions for the teachers and try to
advise them on how to face the violence phenomena in the classroom.&quot;
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;We focus on the issue of democracy (not the political
meaning)-the democratization of education,&quot;  he says.  &quot;We try
to help the teachers create a democratic atmosphere between themselves and
the students.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	He told me that in 1993 the parents worked to establish
parent councils, which had been prevented in the past by the Israelis. 
He said, &quot;We threatened to go to the High Court, so they finally gave
them permission.&quot;  CARE trains these parent councils how to work and
how to cooperate.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	CARE is actively achieving where others only talk and
dream.  &quot;Actions speak louder than words,&quot; as the old saying goes.
 CARE needs our support and prayers to continue their work.  We need to
arm the Palestinians with a good education because &quot;knowledge is power,&quot;
and this kind of power can help in bringing about freedom. </FONT></P>
