<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Five Israeli Soldiers try Sadistic urges
on a Palestinian worker</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT(18 October):</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Five Israeli soldiers yesterday attacked and nearly murdered
a Palestinian laborer near an Israeli army roadblock in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The worker, Ahmed Shaker Shakarneh, from the village of
Nahaline near Bethlehem, said he regained consciousness at the Jerusalem's
Hadasa hospital after sustaining serious head wounds resulting from what
he called &quot;sadistic torture&quot; at the hands of five Israeli soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Thursday 16 October, a Beitshemesh police officer entrusted
the five border policemen to take Shakarneh to the closest Israeli army
roadblock along the green line.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Instead, however, the five soldiers took the Palestinian
laborer, who had been collecting medical herb from the mountainous terrain
nearby, to a remote and uninhabited spot where they &quot;started a party
of beating and of torturing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They started beating with their fists and kicking
me with their army boots until I nearly lost consciousness. Then they started
hurling stones at my head from a short distance, causing a big bleeding,&quot;
Shakarneh said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Then one of them opened up my mouth and put lots
of dirt in it, while the other four were laughing hysterically.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shakarneh said he then was able to walk to the main street,
two hundred meters away, where he found an Arab driver drove him to hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources stress that acts of savagery by Israeli
soldiers against Palestinian laborers are daily happenings and that most
of the time, they pass unnoticed by the world because they happen away from
the media.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas accuses Rabbis of misleading Ulama</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (15 October)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has accused Israel's
High Rabbinate of misleading Muslim Ulama (religious scholars) by urging
them to issue <I>fatwas</I> or religious edicts against Palestinian Islamists'
human-bomb attacks on Israeli targets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The rabbis are being morally selective, they want
our Ulama to condemn violence against Israelis without committing themselves
to do likewise vis-a-vis Israeli-Jewish violence and terrorism against our
civilians,&quot; said Hamas Gaza leader, Dr.Abdulaziz al Rantisi.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday, Hamas mentor and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin received Rabbi Menhame Froman of the settlement of Tekoa near Bethlehem
who reportedly sought to hand him a letter from Chief Sephardi Rabbi Bakshi-Doron
asking Yassin to denounce violence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yassin refused to accept the letter, saying its proper
address is Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The letter read &quot;we have to do whatever we can to
stop violence and the only way to do that is through dialogue. I am hopeful
that Sheikh Yassin can solve this problem. I call on him as a believer in
God.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The letter, however, made no mention of the Israeli occupation
of Arab-Muslim land and of the daily torment meted out to the Palestinians
by the Israeli army and settlers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yassin told Froman Hamas would agree to a cease-fire if
Israel agreed to pull out of the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi, considered a hard-liner within Hamas, said he
was disquieted by &quot;the moral inconsistency of Jewish religious leaders.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We never hear them condemn the barbaric acts of the
Israeli army in the West Bank. Their silence is very frustrating and doesn't
auger well for future contacts between them and us,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi added that it would be very unlikely that Rabbi
Bakshi-Doron or other rabbis would succeed in obtaining fatwas from the
Sheikh of al Azhar repudiating Palestinian resistance against oppression
and occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Jihad against oppression and injustice is well-established
in the Qura'an, an nobody can undo this, and any fatwa to the contrary would
plunge its issuer into hell-fire and would be utterly unacceptable to Muslims,&quot;
he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bakshi-Doron announced on Tuesday that the Sheikh of al
Azhar, Sheikh Sayed Tantawi, had sent him a letter denouncing &quot;religiously-motivated
terror.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, a spokesman for Tantawi was reported as saying
on Wednesday that &quot;the Sheikh's remarks were distorted and taken out
of context.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the spokesman said the Israeli ambassador to
Egypt, Zvi Mazal, omitted &quot;all remarks (made by Tantawi) pertaining
to the Israeli occupation and its causative relation to all forms of Palestinian
resistance.&quot; <BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Zionists destroy more Palestinian homes</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (14 October)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a flagrant measure that flies in the face of the Palestinian
Authority and the international community, the Israeli army destroyed two
more Palestinian homes at the village of Beit Ummar near Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two houses, belonging to Mahmud Abu Dayya and his son
Khaled, were destroyed by the Israeli army at noon Tuesday at the pretext
that they were built without proper licensing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian eyewitnesses said the Israeli army declared
the vicinity where the two homes are located a closed military zone before
bulldozers began to pulverize them in the full view of crying women and
children who have been made homeless thanks to the callous Israeli act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mahmud abu Dayya, distraught by the demolition of his home
which sheltered his family of 9 children, said the Israelis &quot;were behaving
no different than the Nazis...only difference is the name,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Asked why he had not obtained a building license, abu Dayya
said &quot;I tried to obtain a license a hundred times and every time I
went to the Building and Zoning office I was told I couldn't get a license.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources at Beit Ummar also revealed that the
Israeli army is planning to destroy the homes of as many as thirty Palestinian
families for alleged licensing violations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians and human rights activists contend that the
Israeli policy of home-demolition is considered by far the most callous
and evil manifestations of the Israeli occupation of Arab land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, Hamas mentor and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin cited &quot;home-demolition&quot; as one of the chief factors behind
Palestinian Islamists' martyrdom operations against Jewish targets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yassin said Hamas would reconsider attacks on civilian
Jewish targets if and when Israel desisted from assaulting Palestinian civilian
targets, including home demolition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
urged, though half-heartedly, Israel to &quot;stop unilateral acts&quot;
a reference to, inter alia, demolishing Arab homes in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Incidentally, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators were
due to meet Tuesday evening to discuss &quot;confidence-building measures&quot;
between the two sides, including the subject of home demolitions.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian official denies Jordan-PA dispute
over Sheikh Yassin</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman (12 October)- </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmad
Qurei' denied reports that PA Chairman Yasser Arafat accused Jordan of seeking
to undermine his leadership in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;That is not true, absolutely not true. The Jordanian-Palestinian
relationship is stable, solid, and based on strong pillars,&quot; Mr. Qurei'
told reporters in Amman following a meeting on Saturday with Jordan's Prime
Minister Dr. Abdul Salam Majali.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;What was attributed to Abu Ammar (Chairman Arafat)
is unfounded and baseless,&quot; Mr. Qurei' said in a press conference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Qurei' was responding to a question on news reports
which quoted Mr. Arafat as saying at a closed-door meeting of the legislative
council last week that the release of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmad
Yassin and some Palestinian prisoners for the two Mossad agents involved
in the assassination attempt against Hamas' political bureau chief Khaled
Misha'al, was aimed at undermining his leadership.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Qurei' said that contrary to the news reports, Mr.
Arafat stressed on the need to strengthen the coordination with Jordan and
welcomed the release of Sheikh Yassin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The release of Sheikh Yassin would enhance unity
between the Palestinian people,&quot; said Mr. Qurei'.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile in Ramallah, followers of Mr. Arafat's Fateh
organization held a rally Saturday in his support.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are out here today to show that we stand behind
'President' Arafat and against conspiracy attempts by Jordan and Israel
to take over the leadership of the Palestinian people,&quot; said Iyad Wasfi,
a student who attended the rally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nearly one thousand supporters of Mr. Arafat's PLO faction,
Fateh, turned out in downtown Ramallah chanting &quot;Abu Ammar, we are
behind you 100 per cent.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu refuses to discuss settlements
with Arafat</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT ( October)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and PA Chairman
Yasser Arafat met at the Beit-Hanun crossing point before dawn Wednesday
in a renewed effort to invigorate the erstwhile stalled peace process on
the Palestinian-Israeli track.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, a reliable Palestinian source close to PA chairman
Yasser Arafat intimated that Netanyahu refused to commit his government
to any freeze on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was no prior word of the American-brokered meeting,
reportedly at the insistence of U.S. Envoy Dennis Ross who hoped that by
keeping the press away, Arafat and Netanyahu would be better able to overcome
their differences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the meeting, the first in eight months, Ross
said the two leaders agreed to hold regular meetings to advance what he
called &quot;the peace making efforts.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Palestinian source mentioned above described
Ross optimistic remarks as &quot;what he would like to see happen rather
than what is happening.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The meeting took place only to satisfy American demands.
It took place without any adequate preparation...It seems the Americans
think that by just talking, problems will be resolved,&quot; said the source
which spoke on condition of anonymity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources pointed out that the bulk of the meeting
was devoted to the &quot;terrorism issue&quot; with Netanyahu pressing Arafat
&quot;to do much more in the fight against terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last the PA closed down sixteen charitable, social and
educational institutions associated with Hamas in Gaza. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The measure gained American and Israeli approval and satisfaction
but invited strong indignant reaction from Palestinian masses and the Legislative
Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Observers here surmise that Netanyahu agreed to meet with
Arafat purely for public relations considerations, given the brewing crisis
stemming from the 25 September Mossad bungled operation to murder Hamas
political bureau chief Khaled Masha'al in Amman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;He (Netanyahu) just wants to deflect attention from
the series of scandalous blunders he has made,&quot; said Labor Party Leader
Ehud Barak, commenting on the meeting at Erez.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, the Palestinian Authority described the meeting
as &quot;very important.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, said the meeting will
have proven very important (if) Netanyahu is sincere in implementing the
agreements and (if) he stops unilateral measures, an obvious allusion to
the construction of Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The key word in Abu Rudeineh statement is the &quot;if,&quot;
given the fact that talks between the two sides stopped abruptly in March
after Israel started to build a new settlement at Jabal Abu Ghuneim on the
outskirts of East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, many pundits here argue that Arafat has made a
significant concession to Netanyahu by agreeing on the resumption of talks
at the joint-committee level and by agreeing to meet with Netanyahu while
settlement-building is continuing unabatedly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israel TV, Arafat had demanded that Netanyahu
agree to at least temporarily stop construction of Jewish colonies in the
West Bank before the meeting was determined, but Netanyahu refused.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Hamas leaders ended a brief honey-moon with
Arafat in the aftermath of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yasin's release from
Israeli detention and return to Gaza.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, a senior Hamas leader in Gaza,
said the meeting at Erez was &quot;futile just like previous encounters.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;There is no reason to believe that it will be any
different.&quot; al Rantisi told Journalists in Gaza on Wednesday.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>YASIN'S TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO GAZA</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gaza- PT (6 October)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas founder and spiritual mentor, Sheikh Ahmed Yasin,
received a hero welcome upon his arrival in Gaza city on Monday afternoon,
6 September, with thousands of supporters and well-wishers greeting the
61-year-old wheel-chair bound Islamist leader with &quot;<I>ahalan wasahlan&quot;
</I>and &quot;God is great.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin was first accorded an official welcome at Palestinian
Authority headquarters on the Gaza shore. Greeting him were Yasser Arafat's
personal secretary al Tayyeb Abdul Rahim, Suha Arafat( standing in for her
husband who had earlier visited the Sheikh in hospital in Amman), and top
PA political and security officials along with high-ranking Hamas leaders
in the Strip. Islamist leaders from the West Bank were not present due to
the Israeli closure on Palestinian territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After the brief official reception, Yasin was taken to
the al Yarmuk stadium where over 30,000 thousand people were awaiting his
arrival since the morning. There, decorated flags and banners greeted Yasin
as &quot;our great leader.&quot; One huge green banner read &quot;In the
name of Hamas we welcome the Sheikh of the intifada.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin addressed the nearly jubilant crowd, appealing for
national unity and urging Palestinians to be strong and united.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;There is no difference between this and that or big
or small. we are all one people united in the face of occupation and oppression,&quot;
he said in an unflinching tone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin told the cheering multitude that &quot;the future
belongs to us because our cause is just and our people is alive and well
and will continue to be alive and well, God willing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin sounded as defiant as ever when he said that &quot;we
must continue to defy our oppressor and foil their efforts to disintegrate
us into shreds.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Yasin, who is physically paralyzed but mentally
alert, said Hamas was not contemplating a cease-fire or truce with Israel
as long &quot;the Israeli soldiers' boots are pressed against our necks
and chests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Resistance,&quot; he said, &quot; is a natural human
right, I'll fight even my own brother if he takes over my home and arrogates
my rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite his conciliatory tone toward the Palestinian Authority
and its chairman Yasser Arafat, Yasin never the less strongly criticized
the closure by the PA in Gaza last month of sixteen social, educational,
and charitable institutions associated with the Islamist movement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said &quot;I call on the authority not to succumb to
American and Israeli pressure, and to desist from incarcerating our sons
because this is not in our interests; it is inadmissible to close civil
institutions just because the Americans and the Israelis demand that to
be done.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin was flown directly from Amman aboard a Jordanian
Air Force helicopter following the conclusion of a hastily-made deal between
Jordan King Hussein and Israel whereby Israel freed Yasin and scores of
other Palestinian prisoners in return for releasing from Jordanian custody
of the two Mossad agents who on 25 September attempted to assassinate in
Amman the head of Hamas political bureau Khaled Masha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The release of Sheikh Ahmed Yasin and twenty two other
Palestinians from Israeli detention was undoubtedly a significant morale-booster
for most Palestinians who had of late given to mounting frustration, given
Benyamin Netanyahu's determined efforts to impose the fait accompli in the
West Bank and American and international powerlessness to stop Israeli insolence.
The freedom of Yasin and scores of other Palestinian detainees already released
and slated to be released soon was after all earned almost at no cost for
the Palestinians. &quot;It was a gift of God,&quot; said Hamas leader Mahmud
al Zahar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, many ordinary Palestinians feel Yasin's words
breathe inspiration and encouragement into the hearts and minds of thousands
of Palestinians who otherwise have accustomed to seeing Yasser Arafat repeatedly
give in to Israeli dictates and blackmail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Here we have a leader who sticks with his principles
regardless of the balance of power...only a real man like Yasin can make
a real peace with Israel,&quot; said a Hebron Islamist doctor upon seeing
Yasin's helicopter land in Gaza.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Notwithstanding, the Palestinians' joyful reaction to Yasin's
freedom and homecoming was fraught with some consternation at King Hussein
for concluding a deal with Israel that enabled the Jewish state to smoothly
retrieve &quot;our big hunt,&quot; the two Mossad agents who had make the
attempt on Khaled Masha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamist sources argued that had the King insisted, he
could have secured the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees from
Israeli jails in return for the &quot;two Canadians.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They pointed out that many of the 22 prisoners released
as a result of the deal were actually Palestinian laborers who were jailed
for entering Israeli without valid entry permits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Non the less, it doesn't' seem that the dismay is deep
enough to overshadow the widespread satisfaction at Yasin's release and
Khaled Masha'al's safety.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We knew from the very inception that the presence
of two Mossad agents in King's Hussein custody is not exactly like them
being in the hands of Hamas...we didn't expect too much form Jordan, anyway,&quot;
said a Hamas leader in Ramallah as news of the swap spread. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is no doubt that the release of Sheikh Yasin will
strengthen Hamas, even in real terms. Observers here believe that the steadfastness
the Sheikh had put up (he refused all along to pledge to renounce 'terrorism'
in return for his release), his dignified and high-profile release from
Israeli detention, and the Mossad failed attempt on Khaled Masha'al in Amman,
will all make the movement more appealing to thousands of erstwhile disenchanted
Palestinian and Arab youths who are dead tired of official Arab impotence
vis-a-vis Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Hamas, thanks to the latest developments, has
been able to gain renewed and badly-needed legitimacy in the region at large.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;From now on, the Hamas factor can't be ignored,&quot;
said Hamas Gaza leader Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi, now considered the most senior
Islamist spokesman in the occupied territories after Yasin himself. &quot;Sheikh
Ahmed Yasin is now viewed as second among equals vis-a-vis Yasser Arafat,&quot;
he asserted, rather satisfactorily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But being &quot;second among equals&quot; carries with
it not only promises of constructive cooperation but also undesirable prospects
of friction and discord, especially in an immature political environment
where the leader, e.g. Arafat, is not really held to serious political accountability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A free Yasin can therefore be either a helping hand for
Arafat or a real thorn in his side, depending on how the PA chairman deals
with Benyamin Netanyahu's policy of &quot;take or leave it&quot; towards
the Palestinians.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel admits responsibility for bungling
attempt on Misha'al's life</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (5 October)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the first official reaction to the foiled assassination
attempt on Hamas leader Khaled Misha'al in Amman on 25 September, Israel
has tacitly admitted responsibility for the terrorist act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, the Secretary of the Israeli government, Dany
Naveh, said in a brief statement that &quot;for the time-being the Israeli
government will not comment on the Misha'al affair.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Naveh claimed Misha'al was &quot;a central figure in Hamas
and is responsible for the death of many innocent Israelis,&quot; suggesting
that it was perfectly legitimate to seek to murder him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Naveh, considered the most hawkish and jingoistic
of the Netanyahu's government, said it was imperative that the Israeli government
protect its citizens against &quot;the terrorists.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, when asked by a journalist whether Israel bears
official responsibility for the failed attack on Misha'al, Naveh said &quot;no
comment.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Israeli Hebrew daily, <I>the Yedeot Ahranot,</I>
confirmed a <I>Sunday Times'</I> report that Netanyahu ordered the assassination
of Khaled Misha'al despite fierce opposition from Mossad head Dany Yatom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The usually reliable Hebrew daily quoted Israeli officials
close to Netanyahu as saying that &quot;the prime minister wanted to present
the Israeli people with a gift on the eve of Rosh Hashana (the Hebrew new
year which occurred on 2 October)&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I wanted Khaled Misha'al dead, that is an order,&quot;
Netanyahu reportedly said to Yatom who opposed the operation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another Israeli paper , the elitist <I>Ha'aretz,</I> described
the Misha'al affair as the most &quot;serious failure ever of the Mossad.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The paper's military commentator, Zeiv Sheff, wrote in
the paper Sunday edition that &quot;this operation is by large the biggest
failure in Mossad's history.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheff pointed out that the Amman debacle caused incalculable
damage to Israel's relations with Jordan and Canada, undermined Israel's
&quot;fight against terrorism,&quot; and dealt a serious blow to the reputation
of the Mossad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meanwhile, Israeli sources quoted Hamas officials
in the West Bank as saying that the Islamist movement was demanding the
release of scores of Hamas activists and guerrilla leaders in Israeli detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the sources, Hamas is demanding the release
of Hasan Salameh, the Islamist guerrilla leader whom Israel sentenced earlier
this year to 1170 years for his role in planning attacks on Israeli targets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There has been no confirmation of this by Hamas.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Terrorism: Israel's modus operandi</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>commentary by Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When Israel signed a 'peace' treaty with Jordan at Wadi
Araba three years ago, many people in the Arab world thought the Zionist
state would abandon terrorism, her most intrinsic and enduring character.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, some Arab heads of state, who seemed to have
gravely misunderstood the Zionist mentality, went as far as forging security
co-ordination with the world's premier terrorist state in the vain hope
that it would shield them from her terror and perfidy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, by now and in the aftermath of the wicked attempt
by the Mossad to assassinate in Amman the chief of Hamas political bureau,
Khalid Misha'al, all that mirage about &quot;a civilised Israel&quot; must
have been dissipated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Suddenly, the &quot;<I>peace partner</I>&quot; has appeared
as it really is, a venomous, cunning snake that knows no friends and abides
by no peace treaties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Never the less, the vile and evil Zionist feat in Amman
on 25 September should not come as a surprise to no body, not certainly
to Muslims who know the Zionists very well. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Terrorism has always been Israel's modus operandi. It is
the other side of Israel; it is her heart and soul. Israel is <I>par excellence</I>
the terrorist state, for it was founded on terrorism. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The list of Zionist atrocities against the peoples of the
region is too long to remember and too ghastly to describe. Names such as
&quot;Deir Yasin, Dawaymeh, Kufr Kasem, Baher Al Baqar, and Qana&quot; (to
mention a few) are and will always be a vivid testimony to Zionist savagery
and barbarity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The murderous assault on Misha'al was, therefore, consistent
and compatible with Israel's well-established and deep-rooted terrorist
traditions. It is well known that the Zionist entity has always sought to
&quot;physically liquidate&quot; the opponents of its occupation of Muslim
land in Palestine. Since its misbegotten birth nearly 50 years ago, the
Zionist terror arm has actually assassinated hundreds of people deemed &quot;dangerous&quot;
to Zionist interests. Again, the list is too long, but names such as &quot;Majed
Abu Sharar, Abu Jihad, Abbas Musawi, and Yahya Ayyash&quot; may shed some
light on Israel's state-sponsored terrorism. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is the brutal ugliness of the Zionist Jewish mentality
that prompts a terrorist-turned-statesman like Benjamin Netanyahu to promise
Israelis &quot;a gift&quot; on the eve of &quot;<I>Rosh Hashana,&quot;</I>
the New Jewish year. Needless to say, the gift was not to be &quot;a breakthrough
in the peace efforts&quot; or anything of this sort, but &quot;human blood
and human flesh.&quot; The gift was to be the head of Khalid Misha'al, a
father of seven children who heads the information office of Hamas in Jordan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The aborted assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al is
a further proof, if proof is needed, that Israel is ruled by a terrorist
junta that pays no respect to international laws and undertakings. For how
else can one explain the Israeli Prime Minister's order to carry out a terrorist
operation on the soil of a country that only three years ago signed a &quot;<I>land-mark
peace treaty&quot;</I> with the Jewish state.?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even Canada, a distant country that is friendly to Israel,
was not spared by the arch-terrorists in Tel Aviv. Falsified Canadian passports
were used by the two Mossad agents for the purpose of disguising their true
identity. Falsified passports of other countries are also used by the Mossad
in order to facilitate its murderous terrorism world-wide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In light, the world's eyes must be wide-open to counter
the state-sponsored terrorism of Israel. Muslims, in particular, ought to
be exceptionally on the alert to counter the emulators of the Gestapo and
the SS. Al Hamdulilah (Thank God) Hizbullah and Hamas have succeeded in
teaching Israel that Muslim blood won't go in vain. Other Muslims ought
to do likewise, or else the Zionists will continue to play the bully-boy
game with us. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Zionist President grants amnesty to Jewish
murderers</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT 2 October</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli president Ezer Weisman has decided to grant amnesty
to several Jewish terrorists and convicted murderers, ostensibly to appease
right-wing extremists who were dismayed by the freeing on 1 October of Hamas
founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, Weisman decided to issue
a &quot;full pardon&quot; for two Israeli Jews convicted of murdering Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the Israeli president said Weisman pardoned
murderer Zeiv Wolf and Girshon Irchcovitc who in 1992 tossed a grenade into
a crowded East Jerusalem market, killing a 72-year old Palestinian merchant,
Abdul Razzak Idkedek.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the two <I>Kahane Hay</I> terrorists had carried
out a number of terrorist attacks on defenseless Palestinians in Hebron
and Jerusalem's old town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A third terrorist belonging to the same cell had earlier
been released, also by a presidential decree.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition to pardoning the two terrorist murderers, Weisman
also decided to reduce the sentence terms of three other Jewish murderers
convicted of killing Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The three murderers include, Yoram Skolnick who in 1993
murdered a Palestinian, Musa Abu Sabha, at the village of Yatta near Hebron
while the latter was in fetters; and Nir Afroni</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>who murdered a Palestinian Gas station worker in Jerusalem;
and Nahshon Wolf who killed an Arab woman near the settlement of Kiryat
Arba'a near Hebron in 1991.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Observers point out that pardoning Jewish murderers of
Palestinians is an &quot;established tradition&quot; in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Haim Herzog, the former Israeli president who died earlier
this year, pardoned over 10 Israeli terrorists convicted of murdering several
Palestinians including two students at the University of Hebron in 1983.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Sheikh Ahmed Yasin Freed; talk of a deal
is rife</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (1 October)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a surprising development, the Israeli occupation authorities
released from jail after midnight Tuesday Hamas founder and spiritual leader,
Sheikh Ahmed Yasin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Yasin's release from the maximum-security Ramle
prison took place at about 1:10 a.m. as a Jordanian helicopter with full
medical gear dispatched by Jordan's King Hussein was awaiting the wheel-chair
bound 65-year-old paralyzed Sheikh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin arrived at the King Hussein Medical Hospital around
1:30 a.m. where he was reportedly received by the Jordanian monarch, Prime
Minister Majali and a number of Jordanian officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to semi-official Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian
sources, the release of Yasin has culminated secret trilateral contacts
and negotiations involving Jordan, Israel and the American administration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The contacts, described as intensive, reportedly ensued
the apprehension last week of the two Mossad agents who attempted to assassinate
in Amman Hamas leader Khalid Misha'al, which reportedly caused great embarrassment
for the Jordanian government, King Hussein personally, and the Israeli government
which singed a peace treaty with Jordan three years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources disclosed that three high-ranking Israeli officials
(Areil Sharon, Yitshak Mordechai and Dany Naveh) arrived in Amman on Sunday
and expeditiously met with Jordan's crown prince Hasan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli delegation reportedly communicated &quot;important
information&quot; from Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to King
Hussein concerning the two Mossad agents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources said an agreement emerged whereby crown prince
Hasan would fly to West Jerusalem on the following day to meet with Netanyahu
in order to discuss the details of the &quot;deal,&quot; which he reportedly
did.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Both Israeli and Jordanian official sources refused to
&quot;confirm or deny&quot; the reported visits, which could suggest that
they did take place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, King Hussein himself alluded to a &quot;deal&quot;
on Tuesday afternoon when he said he hoped Israel would offer &quot;a gesture
of good will&quot; toward the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He actually mentioned Sheikh Yasin by name, saying he hoped
Israel would release &quot;the glorious Sheikh Yasin&quot; in order to improve
the general political atmosphere in the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, Sheikh Yasin himself telephoned his family
in Gaza, telling them he would soon return home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, King Hussein telephoned Hamas leaders in Gaza
and told them that Yasin was free at last and that he was not deported and
that he could return to Gaza once his medical examinations were complete.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The king's phone call was received well by the Islamists,
who retreated from earlier statements in which they accused the Israeli
government of &quot;deporting&quot; Sheikh Yasin, and the Jordanian government
of &quot;connivance with the Zionists.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi actually thanked the King for his role in bringing
about the release of Yasin, saying the Jordanian role deserved profound
appreciation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, privately Islamists are apprehensive about the
talk of a reported deal between Jordan and Israel involving the release
of the two Mossad agents held in Amman in connection with the attempt on
Khalid Misha'al's life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A prominent Islamist leader in East Jerusalem intimated
that the two agents were &quot;a big hunt&quot; and that the Jordanian government
should not &quot;dispose of them lightly.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamist leader said that Jordan now has a strong bargaining
position which could, if properly invested, bring about the release of thousands
of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meanwhile, it is expected that the release of Sheikh
Yasin will enable Hamas to acquire renewed political legitimacy in Jordan
and the Arab world, which some observers opine could lead to more political
moderation on the part of Hamas.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Human Rights organizations censure Arafat</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>for closing Gaza institutions</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT(29 September)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights organizations have renewed their criticisms
of Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat for closing down sixteen
charitable and educational institutions in the Gaza Strip in submission
to Israeli and American demands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) has
labeled the closure of the civilian Islamic institutions &quot;a flagrant
violation of human rights and a serious transgression on the pillars of
civil society.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Basem Eid, Director-General of the PHRMG said in a telephone
interview on Monday 29 September the closure of the Gaza institutions amounted
to &quot;a blind submission to Zionist dictates.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the draconian measure was &quot;totally unjust,&quot;
opining that &quot;it will increase rather than reduce violence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eid, who is gathering details on each of the closed institutions,
said the only people who are now going be hurt by the closure are the poor
and orphan who have no where else to turn to for daily subsistence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Some of these institutions used to provide the poor
with daily food supplement, so I don't understand what purpose does it serve
to starve the poor, the orphan and the underprivileged.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eid ridiculed PA claims that the closure of the institutions
was aimed at serving Palestinian interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is extremely hard to believe that depriving children
from going to schools and closing kindergartens serves Palestinians' interests.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Eid pointed out that the closed institutions
are located in the Gaza Strip where Arafat's authority is stronger, not
in the West Bank where the latest spate of bombings were presumably planned
and executed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said this suggests that the closure was politically
motivated, and had nothing to do with any genuine security considerations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, the another human rights organization, al Damir
(conscience) lambasted the PA for &quot;succumbing to Israeli demands.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The organization issued a written statement describing
the closure of the Gazan institutions as &quot;a clear assault on justice
and human rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, PA chairman Yasser Arafat reportedly told a
group of Hebron civic leaders that he realized that the closure of the Gaza
institutions was unjust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Arafat added that &quot;I have no choice in light
of the intense pressures I am facing.&quot;<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jordanian intelligence source: Israel stands</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>behind assassination attempt on Misha'al</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(28 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A junior Jordanian intelligence source revealed on Sunday
that the two Canadian &quot;tourists&quot; who attempted to assassinate
Hamas political bureau chief in Amman on Thursday were Canadian Jews from
Toronto and bore Israeli as well as Canadian passports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source also intimated that the two were part of a wider
network of Israeli secret agents who entered Jordan in early September for
the purpose of &quot;liquidating Hamas leaders in Jordan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source, who arrived in the West Bank on Friday and
who demanded anonymity, added that several Islamist leaders were on the
cell's hit list including, Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghoshe, Musa Abu Marzuk,
Muhammed Nazzal and Khalid Misha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the source pointed out that Israel and the United
States were exerting &quot;lots of behind-the-scene pressure&quot; on the
Jordanian government in order &quot;not to make a big fuss about what happened&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the treating American cardiologist who arrived
in Jordan on Friday from Cleveland, Ohio, at King Hussein's request, the
effect of the laser torrent which the perpetrators directed at Misha'al's
head was designed to cause Misha'al to die of &quot;respiratory failure
&quot; while sleeping, in order to make his death look as &quot;quiet and
as natural as possible.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The American physician, believed to be an authority on
brain functioning, reportedly said that the ray or laser torrent that penetrated
Misha'al brain had an after-effect on his respiratory system, which could
bring about sudden death if not resuscitated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the Gaza Strip, Hamas spokesman and leader Abdul Aziz
al Rantisi said he was now convinced that the Israeli intelligence stood
behind the assassination attempt on Khalid Misha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi pointed out that the electronic device used by
the perpetrators was the state-of-the art, opining that a technologically
advanced country must have been behind the operation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi praised the &quot;vigilance and swift response&quot;
of Misha'al bodyguards who chased the perpetrators and enabled the Jordanian
police to catch them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Rantisi revealed that the Jordanian authorities
informed Hamas that &quot;the entire death team&quot; had been apprehended.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He expressed hope that the Jordanian government would not
succumb to Israeli and American pressure &quot;not to make an issue of the
incident&quot; because &quot;this is a flagrant assault on Jordanian sovereignty.&quot;<BR>
