<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Recent Bombing in Jerusalem:The Motives
and the Background</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Every time the owl wails in the latter phases of the night
as a witness to the ghastly violence that's persistently perched over the
holy land of Palestine, the mainstream American media somehow becomes more
judgemental of some than others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From behind pointing fingers, Palestinians stand accused
more than ever since 30 July when two of them blew themselves up in a crowded
market in Jerusalem taking fourteen Israelis with them to meet the Landlord
of the planet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Allegedly the attackers were Hamas members hell-bent upon
blowing up the ongoing peace process itself&oacute;or so the media says.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the well-paid clowns of the international media
insinuated that had the last round of negotiations taken place as planned,
there would have been tremendous American pressure on Netanyahu and his
government to cease settlement in Jerusalem; but, alas, the Palestinians
just blew it!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The well-paid clowns of the official Arab and Palestinian
media and puppet regimes joined in the chorus, condemning the bombing and
emphasizing in Arabic and in English that whoever did this must have been
in collusion with Netanyahu and his security apparatus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Little do these Arab and international clowns mention that
on 15 July, the United States was the only state, in addition to Micronesia
and &quot;Israel&quot; itself, to vote AGAINST a U.N. resolution condemning
Zionist settlements in what the U.N. calls the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before that, on 10 June, Congress voted overwhelmingly
to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, thus recognizing it as the capital
of &quot;Israel&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 8 August, the United States again resisted issuing a
resolution in the U.N. condemning the criminal Israeli closure and collective
punishment of the West Bank and Gaza. Shamelessly, the Arab and Palestinian
delegations in the U.N. bowed to U.S. pressure and went along. Yet historically
that's been the only kind of serious pressure the U.S. has exercised&oacute;the
pressure put on Arabs in favour of &quot;Israel&quot;. We challenge anyone
to prove otherwise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But to compensate with rhetoric for what has become a done
deal, and to invest a little in a credibility which could be later used
to extract more concessions from the Palestinian side, &igrave;Mad&icirc;
Albright, the Zionist witch of the State Department, made a couple of comments
about bulldozers and settlements in the territories, and the official Arab
clowns began to celebrate. The people under siege didn't. Neither did they
live happily ever after nor did they fall for words that speak much softer
than horrible deeds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So what were these 'suicide' bombers up to then?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whatever one may think of the recent bombing in Jerusalem,
it wasn't suicide. To the extent those who did it believed in Islam, or
believed they were going to heaven, it wasn't suicide: Islam prohibits suicide
and promises those who commit it to go to hell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But in this day and age where self-interest has become
increasingly the centre of gravity of individual behaviour, acts of self-sacrifice
in the name of a cause seem somewhat irrational; albeit not from the point
of view of those who believe that self-interest should be secondary to some
principle or ideal, be it secular, Marxist, Islamic or otherwise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is depth of commitment that determines how far one is
willing to go. For better or for worse, the two martyrs were willing to
die for their beliefs; they knew beforehand that they were going all the
way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Without appreciation for this, one cannot comprehend the
dynamics of any struggle where the odds are so stacked against the oppressed.
Appealing to self-interest or self-preservation by yielding to the current
balance-of-power is inevitably an argument to preserve the status quo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Social and political change cannot be undertaken by those
too skittish to risk calamity. It was only in this context that Palestinian
children took on the entire Israeli military and security apparatus with
little rocks and little hands during the uprising against the occupation
known as the intifadah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Granted, the loss of any human life is tragic, but from
a purely political perspective, the bombing was part of the effort to raise
the cost of Zionist occupation to our land, and a natural outcome of the
miserable conditions of Palestinian life under that occupation, which the
most recent measures of the Netanyahu government only served to make much
worse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Present and past, it has been the Zionists who invaded,
occupied, killed, imprisoned, tortured, assassinated, air-raided, dislocated,
starved, subjugated and oppressed the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Consequently, as Paulo Friere states in his book Pedagogy
of the Oppressed, &igrave;With the establishment of a relationship of oppression,
violence had already begun. Never in history has violence been initiated
by the oppressed. How could they be initiators if they themselves are the
result of violence?&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Regardless of 'goodwill' on anybody's part, for every &quot;Israeli&quot;
who settled Palestine, a Palestinian has been dislocated, killed or oppressed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why many Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims believe
that the bombings were acts of liberation, not hatred or even revenge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zionist settlers have been and continue killing Arab civilians,
instituting a military, not a civilian, society. With the exception of the
very young and the very old, all able-bodied Israelis ARE conscripts of
the Israeli Defense Forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Their settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are aligned
in military and strategic formations; they cannot be thought of as just
civilian settlements! In the case of Jerusalem, the last wave of settlement
activity is meant to create irreversible and not negotiable political realities
on the ground.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, notwithstanding pressure on Arafat to do what
he was brought into the territories to do, which according to the Oslo Accords
is taking over the dirty job of reigning in Palestinians, it must be emphasized
that destroying Hamas and other opposition groups will bring neither peace
nor security to &quot;Israel&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If for any reason Hamas perishes defending its cause or
even unexpectedly changes course, SOMEONE will fill the vacuum that emerges
just like Hamas filled the vacuum created by Arafat's betrayal of the Palestinian
people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And that's because peace and injustice don't mix. And there's
injustice as long as ANY PART of Palestine is occupied and people are oppressed
or scattered in the Diaspora that the Jews have bequeathed to Palestinians.
Until the injustice is ended, peace is nothing but acquiescence of the downtrodden,
or the successful management of oppression. And therefore won't last.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Crusades lasted about two centuries. Eventually Palestine
was returned to its indigenous Arab population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Israel&quot; has occupied Palestine only since 1948.
History-wise, its not even half-time yet. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Four years after Oslo: Have the skeptics'
views been vindicated?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and the assassinated Israeli
Prime Minister Yitshak Rabin signed the Declaration of Principles at the
White House Lawn on 14 September 1993, much of the world went into rhapsody
over what was described as &quot;a historical breakthrough.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even some newspapers of record such as the <I>Washington
</I>Post and the <I>New </I>York <I>Times</I> were carried away by the false
euphoria. The <I>Post</I> described the agreement as &quot;a giant leap
of faith for a sacred land,&quot; while the <I>Times</I> argued that it
represented &quot;a triumph of hope over history.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, Yasser Arafat sought to sell the vague Accords
to a skeptic Palestinian public as &quot;the first step towards the establishment
of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.&quot; The Israelis,
however, were markedly noncommittal, often arguing that they understood
Oslo to mean &quot;limited Palestinian autonomy whereby the ultimate sovereignty
remains in Israel's hands.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, four years after that famous handshake at the White
House, the Oslo Accords seem to be in a moribund state and kept nominally
alive only by artificial means. The Israeli occupation of the Palestinians'
land and life is now harsher and more tormenting than ever. Palestinian
towns and villages in the West Bank and Gaza are effectively reduced to
&quot;large and crowded detention camps.&quot; A collective &quot;<I>claustrophobia
</I>of <I>the </I>soul&quot; is gripping the Palestinians by the throat,
as Palestinians are confined to their immediate places of residence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In short, the life of an average Palestinian has become
an enduring hell, so much so that many people, and their number is steadily
increasing, are now almost nostalgic for the days of direct Israeli occupation.
The dreams of freedom have evaporated, the euphoria gone, and violence is
imposing itself again on the region as the ultimate arbiter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ironically, many Palestinians did laud the DOP initially
because they thought it would eventually deliver them from the shackles
of Israeli oppression and domination. However, with the passage of time,
and seeing how the agreement was being implemented on the ground, a collective
feeling of being cheated and deceived began to replace whatever enthusiasm
the Palestinians ever had for the agreement. The Israeli grip on Palestinian
land and life has simply been made tighter, the hope for freedom and liberation
collapsed, the dream turned into a nightmare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Four years ago, opposition to the Oslo Agreement was nearly
specific to the intellectual sector and the more politicized segments of
society, in addition to the Islamic movement. Now, however, the &quot;rejectionists&quot;
have been joined by many ordinary citizens who have come to feel &quot;betrayed
and cheated&quot; by a &quot;peace&quot; process that served to lower the
ceiling of Palestinian aspirations and expectations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This peace is killing us,&quot; complained a jobless
Hebron man who used to make a living selling second-hand items in the streets
of East Jerusalem. &quot;They (the Israelis) got all they want, and we got
virtually nothing...getting a work permit or a VIP card for a Palestinian
Authority official has become our most ambitious goal,&quot; he added with
frustration and bitterness clearly noticed in the tone of his voice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Aziz Hayder, Director of the Al-Quds University Regional
Studies Centre, opined that the depressive mood stems mainly from the collapse
of the high hopes and dreams which the PLO sought to build in the hearts
and minds of the people as part of its efforts to sell the peace initiative
to the Palestinian Main Street. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hayder argues that not only the dreams have not come true,
but the Palestinians have actually been exposed to a &quot;new and more
sinister form of occupation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In the eyes of the world, the Palestinians are now
at least partially free; they have a president, a legislative council, an
army and a state in the making. However, this is all pie in the sky since
Israel continues to control the oxygen we breathe and the water we drink...even
Yasser Arafat can't leave the Gaza Strip without a permit from Israel,&quot;
said Abdul-Jawwad Maraka, an outspoken critic of the Oslo Accords</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Maraka argued that through Oslo, Israel has been able to
rid itself of the prospect of a bilateral state, while at the same time
maintaining its grip on the Palestinians, more effectively and more efficiently
than ever before. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the Israelis (Labour and Likud) did everything
to weaken Palestinians' faith in Oslo. The building of Jewish settlements
on the West Bank has increased by 30% since Oslo, with tens of thousands
of hectares of Arab land confiscated for settlement expansion. Moreover,
as many as 530 Arab homes have been destroyed for a variety of concocted
reasons. Around 2,000 more homes are slated to be demolished, mainly for
the purpose of checking demographic Arab growth in East Jerusalem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, the Arab-Islamic identity of East Jerusalem
has nearly been obliterated as Israeli occupation authorities stepped up
the sinister policy of ethnic cleansing against Palestinians which usually
manifests itself in two ways: withdrawal of residency rights from East-Jerusalemite
Arabs and denying them building licenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meantime, the occupation authorities continue to
deny both Muslims and Christians access to their respective holy places
in East Jerusalem. This is happening at a time when Jews and Israelis can
travel almost anywhere in the Arab world without any restrictions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the West Bank itself, Israel (thanks to Oslo) has effectively
retained most, if not all, of the <I>assets</I> while throwing all the <I>liabilities</I>
to Yasser Arafat. Thus, for example, when Palestinian towns are denied drinking
water supplies for prolonged periods, as is often the case since the Israelis
control the tap, the blame is pinned on Arafat. Indeed, Palestinians have
complained on many occasions to the Chairman that &quot;we are thirsty,
Mr. President, and our children go to school in the morning without getting
their hands and faces washed.&quot; But the president would only shrug in
their faces, telling them rather disagreeably that &quot;I have more paramount
issues to deal with...go to Sa'eb Ereikat (minister of local governance)&quot;.
But Ereikat has no answer, since the Oslo Accords allows Israel to have
absolute control of water sources with predictable ramifications to Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Palestinian indignation is over much more than just
water. The West Bank, the supposed ear-marked home for the would-be Palestinian
state, has been replaced by a series of scattered Bantustans and an Israeli-dominated
Jerusalem. Any visitor to the West Bank would see for himself how Palestinian
population centres have become similar to isolated islands in the midst
of a sea of Jewish settlements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Authority, which was initially welcomed
on the premise that it would accelerate Palestinian emancipation from Jewish
bondage, has been a big disappointment, even a fiasco. The PA has also turned
out to be a manifestly corrupt autocracy run by one man, Yasser Arafat,
who holds all the reins, controls all the money and takes all the decisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, the PA often performs at Israel's beck and
call, in effect doing the Israeli army's dirty work in the West Bank. However,
when and if the PA Chairman hesitates to heed Israeli dictates and demands,
Netanyahu accuses him of &quot;dragging his feet in fighting terror&quot;;
yet when Arafat does the dirty work, e.g. carrying out massive arrests among
the opponents of the Israeli occupation, the Chairman succeeds only in creating
the image of &quot;collaborator&quot; for himself, while getting virtually
nothing from Israel. Needless to say, continuous Israeli bullying, coupled
with Arafat's inherent powerlessness, has resulted in the Chairman becoming
a vanquished supplicant for Palestinian rights instead of the &quot;equal
partner&quot; he had once thought Oslo would make of him. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, the overall outlook seems so bleak for Palestinian
rights that some Palestinian intellectuals have come to consider the Oslo
agreement as an Israeli-American conspiracy aimed at liquidating or completing
the liquidation of the Palestinian issue. Professor Naseer Aruri, a Palestinian
intellectual from Ramallah, contended in a recent article in the London-based
bimonthly journal <I>Middle </I>East <I>International</I> that the Oslo
Accords left &quot;four million Palestinian refugees on the back burner;
the would-be catalyst for Arab unity has become the worst example of segmentation...[and]
the oppressed have become the oppressor, the revolutionary collaborator
and the resister a quisling.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The recent conflagration of violence in Jerusalem is a
living testimony to the failure of Oslo. Obviously, this means that Oslo
has achieved neither justice for the Palestinians nor security for Israel.
Worse still, time is running out and may have already run out for a peaceful
settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oslo was a brat as deformed as the oblique balance of power
that brought it into existence. Hence, it was a bad start, and a bad start
usually makes a bad end. In the current Palestinian context, this seems
to need no further proof.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Moskowitz-Zionism's new Rothschild</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Is Jewish money building houses or digging
graves?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Azzam Tamimi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly, the Muslims of our time are losing Jerusalem,
not politically, because political authority had long been lost, but physically.
The Oslo agreement signed between Israel and the PLO four years ago has
made it possible for such physical loss to be expedited. Jerusalem, among
several other main issues, was left unmentioned in the 'peace' deal and
has purposely been postponed until a final negotiation stage that will encompass
and complete earlier stages in which much less important issues, at least
as far as the Palestinians are concerned, are dealt with. In the meantime,
Israeli politicians from the extreme left to the extreme right maintained
a unified position on Jerusalem, their self-proclaimed 'eternal capital'.
Labour as well as Likud would have done everything to accomplish this dream
and prevent the Palestinians from ever claiming a right to the holy city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although the Palestinian partner in the agreement insists
that it was stipulated not to effect any changes on the ground until the
final stage negotiations are held, Israelis spared no time in doing what
they could to bring about irreversible changes, most notably the replacement
of Arabs with Jewish extremists, or more accurately Jewish terrorists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Likud government has noticeably been much less subtle
in its straightforward approach than the Labour-led government. Since Benyamin
Netanyahu came to power more than 15 months ago, he has openly supported,
or his administration has initiated, the expropriation of Arab lands in
East Jerusalem and authorized the implementation of housing projects for
Jewish settlers in the usurped territories. The methodology pursued by the
Israeli government is reminiscent of the early Zionist invasion of Palestine.
Land is said to be bought from its Palestinian owners and funds are generously
donated by Jewish Zionists. In the past it was the Rothschild barons of
Europe who shouldered the responsibility and now it is American bingo kings,
such as Moskowitz, who undertake to accomplish the Zionist dream.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Moskowitz affair has been condemned worldwide and by
many Israelis inside Israel itself. The influence people like Moskowitz
have on the Israeli prime minister has dismayed many Israelis, who feel
threatened by this very overt campaign to Judaize the Islamic quarter of
Jerusalem. Even some of the prominent figures in Israel's fifth column in
America, the so-called Jewish lobby, have expressed dissatisfaction with
the overzealous brand of Zionism Moskowitz upholds. This, by the way, has
not been Moskowitz's first venture. It was he who financed the renovation
of the Hasmonean tunnel in the Old City last year and was with Prime Minister
Netanyahu for the opening of a new door to it, an initiative that sparked
clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians that left at least 75 dead
and more than a thousand wounded. This is exactly the sort of repercussion
some Israelis have warned against. Israel simply cannot afford, let alone
handle, an intifadah, especially when the Palestinian Authority (PA) is
not so keen on preventing its eruption or its escalation. Undeniably, the
PA now has many more reasons that Netanyahu can think of to allow, or even
initiate, a Palestinian popular expression of anger and frustration. The
Israelis know all too well that a stone-throwing intifadah is not the only
prospect awaiting them. The streets of West Jerusalem, of Tel Aviv, of Ashkelon
and of other Israeli towns are not beyond the reach of human bombs. The
only real obstacle that makes such prospects harder to achieve is the PA's
security commitments. Once the PA decides to teach the Israelis a tough
lesson, all it needs to do is lower its gaze and pretend not to see or know
what those who are intent on the destruction of the Zionist project seek
or plan to do.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is widely believed among Palestinians now that the PA
is more capable, or to be precise more willing now than ever before to blackmail,
or let's say pressure, the Israelis. Israel has helped the PA, or at least
some of its departments, to see with clarity how vulnerable Israel is to
the use of force. Hizbullah and Hamas have brought the Israelis to their
knees. The daring operations of Hizbullah have stirred a feverish debate
within Israeli official as well as public circles over the option of a unilateral
and unconditional withdrawal from South Lebanon. Hamas, or whosoever, human
bombs have forced the Israelis to talk once more to the PA and forced Albright
to come to the region carrying with her a carrot and a stick to lure or
intimidate the PA into destroying what she referred to as the infrastructure
of terrorism, implying that Hamas and other Islamic institutions are suspected
of sympathizing with its programme or ideology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just as Lebanon, and for that matter Syria, has no hope
in driving the Israelis out of South Lebanon and dictating at least some
terms of any future agenda for negotiations, the PA knows that without Hamas
the Israelis would only use it as a brush for their dirty shoes. The PA,
especially after the PLO had lost most of its support among Diaspora Palestinians,
also knows well that it cannot afford to be seen by the Gazan and West Bank
Palestinians as a mere stick in the hand of Israeli generals to punish or
discipline the rest of the population. No matter how compromising the PA
is, and no matter how corrupt some of its officials are, they remain part
of the Palestinian people and will always feel accountable to it. The majority
of the Palestinians are now disillusioned with the peace process, suspicious
of Netanyahu and his administration and eager to see more punishment incurred
upon the Israelis. So, will Moskowitz accomplish the Zionist dream or turn
such dream into a nightmare?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Locked Up Without Trial</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Allegra Pacheco</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abed al-Rahman al Ahmar, aged 30, has another six months
in &quot;administrative detention.&quot; A second generation Palestinian
refugee from Deheishe camp near Bethlehem, al Ahmar is still a university
student. Israel's continual use of administrative detention and interrogations
have prolonged his studies, as they have for many other Palestinian political
activists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Administrative detention means imprisonment by military
order without charges or trial. International law permits an occupier to
use this measure for brief periods only, provided there are imperative reasons
of security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Consecutive Israeli governments have abused the measure
to imprison, repeatedly and indefinitely, the members of the Palestinian
opposition (i.e. those who oppose the Oslo accords as the means to achieve
a just peace.) Israel resorts to this measure when it has no evidence or
legally-enforceable charges against these people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bethlehem was still under occupation in November 1995 when
the Israeli army arrested al Ahmar as he was returning home from the city's
university. Since then the Israeli occupation army has redeployed from the
town, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has stepped in, and the occupation
of the city has ended--at least nominally. Under Article 77 of the Fourth
Geneva Convention, the occupying force must release the detainees to the
authorities of the liberated territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet on July 28 this year, Israel's General Security Services
(GSS or the Shin Bet) issued al Ahmar his fourth consecutive administrative
detention order, this time until February 1998. At the end of this six month
period, al Ahmar will have spent two years and three months languishing
in Ha-Sharon prison, Central Israel, without a charge or trial. The Shin
Bet will then probably extend al Ahmar's detention for a fifth time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Ahmar is not alone. More than half the 800 Palestinian
administrative detainees are serving their second, third, fourth and even
ninth extensions. Ahmed Qatamish, a writer, has been in detention for four-and-half
years; his brother Ribhi, a lawyer, for more than three years. The list
goes on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>B'Tselem (Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in
the Occupied Territories) concluded that, &quot;the pervasive use of detention
extensions raises the possibility of administrative detention for life.
Detainees have spent up to four years in administrative detention without
knowing why or when they will be released. This uncertainty has devastating
effects on the detainees and on their families. There is no indication that
the authorities intend to release any of the these long term detainees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Until today no one has been able to force the Shin Bet
to stop extending detentions. Appeals from public figures, scattered Knesset
members, reports by &quot;Amnesty International&quot; and B'Tselem have
not produced any results.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli High Court has had many opportunities to intervene,
but it always refrains from challenging the Shin Bet's activities. Time
after time the court takes refuge in legalisms to avoid judicial review.
The Shin Bet's prolonged detentions violate fundamental principles of international
and Israeli law, namely, prohibition against arbitrary detention, the right
to a fair trial and the maxim of &quot;innocent until proved guilty.&quot;
Yet the Court continues to uphold long-term administrative detention out
of deference to the Shin Net's classified &quot;security&quot; considerations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before he received his latest extension, al Ahmar tried
a different approach.He petitioned the High Court before the Shin Bet issued
its order instead of after. His petition requested that the court order
the security apparatus to explain why it intended to extend his detention
for the fourth time instead of either releasing him or bringing him to trial.
AL Ahmar argued that because the Shin Bet had violated his liberties and
freedom so severely, he had the right to demand that it justify its proposed
extension. He could have appealed against the extension after the Shin Bet
issued the order, but this would have been too late. The court would have
heard the appeal not less than a month after the order was issued, defeating
al Ahmar's aim of preventing even a day of unjustified imprisonment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, al Ahmar argued that for anyone accused under
Israeli law, a judicial review is required before the police can extend
the period of interrogation. It is also required if the police wish to hold
the accused in prison until the end of the legal proceedings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, al Ahmar pointed out that the Shin Bet had interrogated
him during his detention and had still not brought charges against him.
This indicated , he said, that it intended to keep him in prison indefinitely.
It was up to the High Court, therefore, to examine the extension intensively
before it went into effect in order to prevent a breach of justice and Israeli
law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli High Court, however, ignored all of Al Ahmar's
arguments. Justices ruled that the court could not intervene in this case,
although they acknowledged that his 21 months in detention were appalling
by all other standards.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In his opinion, justice Barak wrote &quot;The order concerning
administrative detention set up an (appeals) procedure by which to act,
and this procedure cannot be bypassed.&quot; In particular, Barak referred
the petitioner to the Military Appeals committees. But al Ahmar had already
argued that these were not impartial forums, and detainees had been boycotting
them for more than a year. Leaning on a technicality, Barak therefore chose
to defer to the unjust military order rather than change it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By refusing to make the Shin Bet respond to al Ahmar's
claims, justice Barak effectively save it from having to open its actions
to outside scrutiny. Thus the High Court once again reneged on its obligation
to review without prejudice the questionable actions of the secret security
service, reinforcing its conviction that it can continue imposing &quot;administrative
detention for life&quot; unhindered by judicial intervention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ruling undermined the court's legitimacy as a fair
and impartial forum for those seeking redress against the government's actions.
The High Court failed to live up to its self avowed dictum of &quot;clear
expression in the laws emanating from this court&quot; and of &quot;democratic
values and principles of freedom, liberty and equality.&quot; Justice Barak's
decision was a pointed reminder that <I>High Court is not an independent
judicial body when it </I>comes to Palestinian human rights, but just another
member <I>of the Israeli </I>security apparatus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Time passes. Life goes on for all of us. But for al Ahmar
and the 800 administrative detainees like him, life remains suspended indefinitely
in the crowded, miserable conditions of the Ha-Sharon, Tel Mond, Damoun
and Megiddo prisons. For some this means another year of university studies
lost; for others, another year away from their children and loved ones.
The state of Israel and its &quot;liberal&quot; High Court of Justice remain
conspirators in this flagrant assault on freedom.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli 'Deal of Thieves' to Settle in Ras
al Amud</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The takeover of two Arab homes in the Ras Al-Amud neighborhood
of East Jerusalem by 11 Israelis settlers on September 14 was hardly surprising
to most Middle East observers. Five days before the July 30 suicide bombing
in West Jerusalem, the Jerusalem licensing committee approved a plan for
building a 32-unit housing complex for Jewish settlers in the centre of
the 12,000 strong Palestinian neighborhood. The long-delayed approval was
given to Miami real-estate tycoon and supporter of far-right Zionist groups
and policies, Irving Moscowitz, who reportedly purchased the land in 1990
and has sought to build a settlement there as a political statement on Jewish
sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. This is the same Moscowitz whose pressure
to open the tunnel near Al-Aqsa Mosque in September 1996 sparked a mini-war
in the territories that left nearly one hundred dead and over a thousand
Palestinian civilians injured. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli Jerusalem municipality agreed in late July
on a plan submitted by far-right Moledet party activist Benny Elon which
called for the building of apartments in the Arab section of East Jerusalem
between the village of Silwan and the Mt. of Olives. Previous efforts to
push through this plan, in a somewhat different form, in the early 1990s
were linked to building Arab housing as well in the area to help ease the
severe housing crunch. In 1992, Interior Minister Eli Suissa, who was also
head of the District Planning Commission, linked the building of Jewish
housing in Ras Al-Amud to the building of 560 Arab housing units there as
well. This plan was held up for years by Yitzak Rabin, when he was acting
Interior Minister, and former interior ministers Haim Ramon and Uzi Baram.
In his last city council meeting in 1993, Teddy Kollek announced that the
plan was approved against his objections, which were contrary to his stated
policy of not building Jewish housing in heavily populated Arab areas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The new plan that was approved at the end of July initially
caused somewhat of a political uproar in Israel. The Labor Party accused
Netanyahu of pretending that he did not know of the Jerusalem Municipality's
approval of Moscowitz's plans to build in Ras Al-Amud. &quot;Netanyahu is
playing a double game. He know about the building permits and is denying
it. He preferred to let the report be published so that he could pretend
to be against it,&quot; said Dalia Itzik, an Labor MK. Itzik said that the
Primer Minister was again &quot;raising the Jerusalem issue to the top of
the international agenda, causing the Palestinians to react sharply against
us and making the Palestinian look much better than we do - not to mention
that his move endangers the unity of Jerusalem.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jerusalem is, of course, anything but united. Even before
the Likud took power in May, 1996 Israeli behavior in Jerusalem has brought
the territories to the brink of an explosion. The confiscation of hundreds
of Arab Jerusalem I.D.s, the demolition of &quot;unlicensed&quot; homes,
continued construction of Jebal Abu Ghuneim, the expulsion of Arab Beduins
for the expansion of the Ma'aleh Adumin settlement and the strict collective
closure resulting from the suicide bombings have increased tension in the
holy city. Ras Al-Amud may become the spark that again bring Israeli and
Palestinian confrontations to a violent impasse. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not important anymore whether Netanyahu was playing
a game with the proposed settlement of Ras Al-Amud. The fact that the settlers
moved into the disputed Arab land while he is the Prime Minister is what
matters. On September 14, Israeli settlers, with heavy police protection,
took over two Arab homes in the area. Netanyahu has claimed that he is not
responsible for the settlers taking such a provocative step at this time,
but it is clear he is not so concerned about the consequences that he is
willing to forcibly remove the settlers, especially without U.S. pressure.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Clinton administration, as usual, is not willing to
take the diplomatic steps necessary to make the Israelis behave themselves.
Instead of reacting to the taking of homes and the proposed effort to create
yet another Jewish settlement on Arab land captured in 1967, the U.S. sought
to mediate a compromise that would get the &quot;peace process&quot; back
on track. This compromise was in the form of replacing the 11 settlers with
ten Jewish seminary students, who are armed and heavily protected by Israeli
soldiers. &quot;Our main concern that the nature of this neighborhood would
not change over time appears to have been met and we have received assurances
(from the Israeli government) that this will not be changed,&quot; said
State Department spokesman James Rubin. He then went on to call for the
PA to return to the negotiating table with the Israelis and to better fight
&quot;terrorism&quot; in the region.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There should be no question in anyone's mind to the purpose
and objectives of the settlers at Ras Al-Amud. One of the leaders, Baruch
Marzel, a leader in Kach party, said that the entry of the Jews into the
area meant &quot;the neighborhood has begun. We don't need a permit to build
if we already have a house.&quot; He then described the struggle in East
Jerusalem to be one of sovereignty and to ensure that any future negotiations
over the area would be undermined by the presence of Jews in Arab areas.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It has been 18 months since Netanyahu won a surprising
victory in Israel. The effort to find a common ground between Israelis and
Palestinians in the holy land has been rolled back during this time by policies
of a Likud party that is more interested in having land than in having peace.
As a result, there are now more and more Palestinian youths willing to sacrifice
themselves in suicide attacks because they feel that there is no prospect
for achieving their rights at the negotiating table. Considering the current
state of diplomacy in the Middle East, who can argue with them?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Perception, Not Reality, Dictates American
Views of Arabs</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If there is one phrase that would define how Americans
understand the world, it would be &quot;perception is reality.&quot; What
does that mean?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It means that most Americans don't have time to understand
the complexities and problems of the Middle East conflict. So they rely
on their &quot;perceptions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>American perceptions are forge not by the political leaders
they elect to represent them in the White House or in the Congress, but
at the Movie Houses and Theaters where hundreds of films are made each year
that portray the Arab World and the Palestinian cause in viciously negative
ways.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hollywood, not Congress, is the greater threat to the righteousness
of the Arab Cause. People in the Arab World don't really grasp the significance
and sadness of this fact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, Americans don't care who is right or wrong.
They don't care about your pain or suffering. They don't care about the
righteousness of your cause. They don't even care about something as basic
as &quot;who is right and who is wrong.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No wonder they support Israel, the primary aggressor in
the Middle East, and they dislike the Palestinian People, who are one of
the main victims of this Israeli aggression. Americans care about image.
What they see. What they hear. If you put an Israeli and a Palestinian in
front of American TV, as we have done over the past 50 years or more, and
ask each one to concisely present their case, the Americans will almost
always feel sympathy for the Israeli. Why? Because of perception forged
by Hollywood movies.Years of Hollywood movies presented at theaters and
on television have conditioned Americans into believing that &quot;Israelis&quot;
are good, and that &quot;Palestinians and Arabs&quot; are bad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before we even get to say &quot;Hello,&quot; the American
audience has already made its first choice to support the Israeli.Americans
look to see which one looks and talks more like an American? The Israeli
or the Arab?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In years past, Israeli lobbyists have taken great care
to project themselves as &quot;ordinary&quot; Americans, while the Arab
spokesmen have retained their Arab characteristics of dress and speaking
habits. If you don't &quot;sound&quot; American, Americans will not support
you. That's one reason why most Americans don't like Yasser Arafat, an engineer
who gave up his profession to fight for the righteousness of a just cause.
Americans don't even care about the just cause, but they do always complain
about the fact that Arafat never shaves and has a &quot;5 day growth&quot;
that looks shabby. His English, also, is terrible, and they make fun of
that too. It sounds unfortunate that Americans would look past the pain
of the Palestinian people and instead focus on something so superficial
as &quot;looks.&quot; But, it is true.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This perception is reinforced by Hollywood movies. To most
Americans, &quot;who is right&quot; is less important than who is &quot;more
like them.&quot; Americans identify with other people who look, sound, dress
and act like Americans. If you look &quot;foreign,&quot; you will not win
over American sympathy. Arafat doesn't look American. Benjamin Netanyahu
does!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In America, it is not what you say, but how you say it
that counts. That is one reason why most Americans have rejected the Palestinian
Cause, and have instead embraced the cause of Israel. Israel has done a
great job of manipulating public image in America, through the newspapers
and other publications, but mostly by influencing Hollywood movies. Of some
250 movies made in Hollywood that address Middle East subjects, almost each
relies on negative stereotypes of Arabs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Arab World is making a major mistake by concentrating
its efforts solely on influencing the politics of this country through the
White House, the US Congress and through other political agencies. The fact
is that American politics is forged not from the Top Down, as it is in other
countries, but from the Bottom Up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Democracy really means that individuals in this country
can decide who will represent them in Congress. Congressmen are elected
by people who have spent their lives watching Hollywood movies like &quot;True
Lies&quot; which Arnold Schwarzenegger battles an army of evil looking Arab
and Muslim terrorists. The Arab World would be better off lobbying Hollywood
and concentrating their efforts on producing movies that correct the Arab
image and portray Israel in a true light as the aggressor in Middle East
affairs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Believe it or not, one well done movie that portrays the
Arab World in a positive light and Israel in a negative light, would have
more impact on the American public than all the lobbying the Arab World
is doing in Congress. Oh, we need the lobbying in Congress. But, we need
the Hollywood Movies, too!</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>IT'S COMPENSATION TIME</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Robert W. McGee*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionists in occupied Palestine continue their human
rights abuses against the Palestinian people. They have been exercising
their Nazi-like collective punishment policy against 2.5 million Palestinians
in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention for the last two months while
trying to blame the Palestinians for a breakdown in the &quot;peace&quot;
process. Palestinians cannot travel within their own country. They are subject
to security checks. Hundreds of Palestinians have been refused permission
to return to their own homes. But why should they need permission in the
first place? After all, it is their country! They have been denied access
to Israeli courts. But why can't they have their own Palestinian courts?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Food and medical supplies cannot pass freely, even through
Gaza or the West Bank. Factories and businesses have had to close, resulting
in thousands becoming unemployed. Shortages are driving prices up, further
weakening the economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Administrative detentions continue. Prisoners continue
to die mysteriously in prison while under Israeli custody. They are denied
the basic right to a hearing or a day in court. Palestinian homes continue
to be blown up without just cause. Palestinian land continues to be confiscated
without just compensation. And all that U.S. Secretary of State Albright
can do is fly around having photo ops and pay lip service to the peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some countries in the West have labelled Libya, Iran and
Iraq terrorist states. At times, there have been attempts to seize the assets
these countries hold in Western banks. Yet no one has ever seriously tried
to freeze and/or seize the assets that the Zionist government of Israel
has in Western banks. Why not? Any government that terrorizes a minority
group that numbers in the millions within its own country surely qualifies
as a terrorist country. Palestinians have been threatened, humiliated, subjected
to verbal and physical abuse, and denied the right to travel or the opportunity
to work for years. Their schools have been closed numerous times for little
or no reason.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Any country that engages in such human rights abuses for
so long deserves to be labelled a terrorist country. The Palestinian people
deserve compensation for the abuses they endure on a daily basis; the Zionists
in occupied Palestine should pay. Their bank accounts in Switzerland, New
York, London and elsewhere should be frozen until the courts can determine
the amount of damage their anti-human policies have caused. The United States
government should turn off the dollar spigot that has been pouring billions
of dollars into the various Zionist terrorist regimes for decades.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionists will not stop their human rights abuses until
the cost of continuing is prohibitively high. Cutting off aid and freezing
their assets held abroad will get the ball rolling.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Albright's Odious Lies</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During her maiden visit to Palestine and the autonomous
enclaves, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright committed numerous
half-truths, corrupt analogies, spurious conclusions and even some malicious
outright lies. In fact, one can safely argue that wilful mendacity and deliberate
malice represented the gist of her many speeches and statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Putting &quot;Israeli security&quot; at the heart of her
talks and conversations with Israeli and Palestinian interlocutors, Albright
unashamedly claimed that &quot;terrorism&quot; was by far the main cause
of the current stalemate of the moribund peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Obviously this is an outright lie, and the Zionist lady,
who has all the pertinent CIA reports at her service, knows as well as anybody
else, and certainly more than most people, that her assertion is false,
to put it mildly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright knows that Benyamin Netanyahu sent his bulldozers
to pulverize occupied land at Jabal Abu Ghneim long before there were bombings
in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionist lady must also be aware that the &quot;massacre
of Palestinian homes&quot; or home-demolition, along with flagrant land
seizure, ethnic cleansing in al Quds, and Jewish settlement expansion were
continuing at a frantic pace well before the bombings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other words, what she so lightly calls &quot;terrorism&quot;
effectively has nothing to do with the fate to which the originally precarious
process has been consigned. The truth of the matter is that Israeli, Jewish
terrorism, towards which she is either silent or supportive, caused the
current stalemate, triggering the recent bombings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, and with all honesty, it is more than fair to
say that the bombings, as well as all other forms of Palestinian resistance
to the evil Zionist occupation, have been, are, and continue to be the &quot;<I>EFFECT&quot;</I>
rather than the &quot;<I>CAUSE&quot; </I>of Israel's persistent policy in
the West Bank aimed at dispossessing the Palestinians of their homeland,
which would turn them effectively into the &quot;Red Indians of the Middle
East.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, for God's sake, how are the Palestinians supposed to
behave in the face of the overwhelming Israeli oppression and torment? They
did give peace a chance and the result was only narrower horizons and tighter
nooses around their necks. Now, if they don't do anything, they will be
&quot;disposed of&quot; swiftly and silently, and if they try to fight back
at their wicked and arrogant enemy, which has the U.S. at its beck and call,
they will be branded as &quot;terrorists and murderers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright's most scandalous and manifestly idiotic statement
was, however, when she unashamedly and nonchalantly claimed that &quot;Hamas
and the Islamic Jihad movements (<I>not Israel) </I>were the average Palestinian's
enemy.&quot; Clearly, this is a cardinal insult to peoples' intelligence
because Mrs. Albright would like us to believe that Hamas, not Israel, is
the party destroying Palestinian homes, confiscating Palestinian land, besieging
Palestinian towns and villages, and, not the least of which, practising
ethnic cleansing against Palestinians in East Jerusalem!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas is not the enemy of the Palestinian people. And 99.999%
of the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim peoples believe that Israel and her
backers are the enemies of the Palestinians and Muslims the world over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our enemy is our tormentor, the occupier of our land, and
the usurper of our rights. Our enemy is the one that says to our enemy &quot;we
are with you forever&quot; and &quot;vow to maintain your qualitative edge
over all other Arabs and Muslims.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But one should not be surprised by such statements, especially
coming from the lady who refused to blame the Israeli army for massacring
100 defenceless Lebanese men, women and children at Qana in April of 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, one should be surprised, even affronted, by those
Arab and Muslim leaders who entrust the American Zionist lady with paramount
Arab and Muslim issues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albright openly says that all Arabs and Muslims are not
worth a Jew's fingernail as far as she is concerned. In other words, she
has already made up her mind about us, and the verdict is negative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, no amount of sycophancy and pleasantry would
change her mind about us. She is simply the enemy and the judge combined,
isn't she?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Arabs and Muslims do have an option if they decide
to free themselves from the curse of subservience to America. They must
start giving more attention to their own peoples' feelings. They must learn
to value the legitimacy that comes from their peoples' acceptance more than
that which comes from the foreigners' acceptance because only then will
they be stronger and less vulnerable to external blackmail and pressure.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Final Settlement</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By John Hartung*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's objectives for a Final Settlement with the
Palestinians were recently described by Uzi Benziman: &quot;to annex at
least 50 percent of the West Bank (the Jordan Valley, the old Green Line,
Gush Etzion and greater Jerusalem); to allow the Palestinian Authority no
more than the status of a quasi-state (like Puerto Rico or Andora) without
arms or an army; to continue controlling its borders and airspace; to be
able to limit its immigration and its access to Israeli [sic] water resources;
to leave most of the Israeli settlements under Israeli sovereignty; and
to continue Israeli control over both parts of Jerusalem, while possibly
granting some status to an Arab entity over the Temple Mount mosques&quot;
(Ha'aretz, September 21).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Benziman assured readers that because such a proposal &quot;has
no chance of winning American support,&quot; it cannot be openly discussed.
So when the Israeli cabinet met to discuss a Final Settlement plan, &quot;Instead,
ministers listened to reports about army preparations for an armed confrontation
with the Palestinians.&quot; Unfortunately, Mr. Benziman may be naive. An
armed confrontation with the Palestinians may be Netanyahu's strategy for
gaining American support.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How would that work? First, with the help of people like
Irving Moskowitz, Yigal Amir's fan club and followers of the late Meir Kahane,
Netanyahu will infuriate enough Palestinians to cause enough &quot;terrorist&quot;
incidents to push United States public opinion over the threshold of accepting
an Israeli invasion of territory that is currently under Palestinian control.
This invasion will be claimed to have the sole purpose of &quot;combating
terrorism,&quot; but it will ignite sufficient resistance to provide an
excuse for disarming the Palestinian Authority, killing 10 to 20,000 Palestinians,
expelling a larger number, and when the shooting is over, threatening to
expel the rest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then, in response to threats from the non-US-aligned Arab
world, demands from the US-aligned Arab world, pressure from the non-US-non-Arab
world, and pleas from the United States, in a magnanimous gesture of concession
Netanyahu will reluctantly agree to give Palestinians almost 50 percent
of the West Bank in a set of disarmed Bantustan-like refuge areas that will
be at the mercy of Israel for every drop of water that does not fall from
the sky. In reality, this will not be a concession at all, because Netanyahu
actually wants clusters of non-voting Arabs sprinkled throughout Israel.
Why? Somebody has to pick the Zionist fruit, carry Zionist bricks, sweep
Zionist streets and clean Zionist toilet bowls - and East Europeans, Africans
and Southeast Asians are too expensive, are causing too much trouble, and
unlike Palestinians, cannot be beaten into submission as part of a Final
Settlement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How can Palestinians prevent Netanyhu's Final Settlement
from happening? By not committing the &quot;terrorist&quot; acts that will
supply Israel with an excuse for initiating a military solution? No, because
Israel would simply keep pushing until they created Palestinian Bantustans
without a major military intervention. By aligning sufficient support from
the Arab world to pose a serious military threat to Israel? Yes, that would
work if it could be done, but it cannot be done because the United States
has made Egypt dependent upon US financial aid and the Arabian Peninsula
dependent upon US military aid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So what might work? Please consider a suggestion: resist
retaliating in reaction to Israeli provocations while you advocate a Final
Settlement plan of your own - a daring plan that would appeal to most people's
sense of justice. Here it is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Propose a new nation for the Middle East. Israel, without
the Golan Heights, should join the West Bank and Gaza. This new country
should not be called Israel and it should not be called Palestine. Any other
name would be acceptable, but I suggest New Canaan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All current inhabitants of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza
would be citizens of New Canaan, and no citizen would be discriminated against,
or receive privileges, on the basis of religion. People residing outside
of New Canaan who were born in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza could immigrate
to New Canaan with their children and receive automatic citizenship. Otherwise,
immigration policy should be determined by a democratically elected government
in any manner that would not discriminate by religious affiliation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because the United States has been critically responsible
for creating the circumstances which require such a major solution, it should
guarantee the security of New Canaan for fifteen years subsequent to its
creation. In addition, the United States should facilitate justice by granting
expedited U.S. citizenship to any former Israeli citizen of New Canaan who
wishes to immigrate to the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sound fantastic? Compared to what? Armed resistance? Arab
unity? The Oslo accords? Divine intervention? A Final Settlement Plan that
could be openly advocated would be a powerful force.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>We will never kneel!</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Firas Awadh*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The best words are those that come from the heart. But
what if that heart is surrounded by death from all sides? Death is accusing
that small heart everywhere and makes it a lover that tries all the ways
to follow its fading love-that love which fades with the dawn and never
comes back again. It has gone and will never return...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Anton, Bashar and I were best friends. We never went anywhere
unless we were together. We played music together, we sang together, we
played soccer together and we called for our country&iacute;s freedom together.
We did not go to the same school but a day never passed without the three
of us meeting. After school each one of us worked with his respective father
and in the evenings we met. None of us could imagine that a day would pass
without seeing each other. Bashar was the youngest and Anton was the oldest.
When we sang in our own band, all of the town heard us. We were always calling
for peace and freedom. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At that time there was no Palestinian Authority so Israeli
soldiers were everywhere. We never feared them, rather they feared children
like us, those children that own the world in their small wet eyes and big
ambitions. Whenever soldiers looked into those eyes, they saw the sadness
and bravery of those children that knew how the world looked more than a
30-year-old person. The thing these soldiers feared most was those children
and their strength. They were stronger than a mountain, they would rather
die than kneel. We actually were happy to throw stones at soldiers. It had
more meaning for us than it had for others. With each stone we threw there
was a hope, a hope that never faded away. I remember Anton once told us,
&igrave;If the stone ever feels the reason why it was thrown, it will never
fall down before hitting their hearts.&icirc; We did not quite understand
what he meant, but later on we did.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the second of May 1991 Anton, Bashar and myself were
calling for freedom. We just wanted to live like people we saw in the movies,
like people in Europe and America. We wanted to have places to go, such
as public parks and gardens, swimming pools and boats. To see a ship would
have been a feast for us. We never saw one though, not because we did not
have a sea but because we couldn&iacute;t see that sea, although it was
very near to our town and eyes. We dreamed of walking the streets without
anyone asking us to stand still beneath the sun for a couple of hours just
because we had taken a walk some previous night. On one particular day,
my mother told me and my friends not to go down to the town. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Why not, mom? It&iacute;s my town...I don&iacute;t
care if they come and arrest me...we have done nothing wrong. We simply
love our country.&icirc; My mother knew that she couldn&iacute;t prevent
us from going since the whole world was down in the town. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Do whatever you want, son, but please stay away
if anything happens.&icirc; She knew that we were the children who would
make things happen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By the time we got down to the town, we couldn&iacute;t
find many of our friends. We started to talk about things in general. It
was about six o&iacute;clock when we heard some shooting at a nearby place.
I saw no immediate reactions. Anton said, &igrave;For how long will these
people keep shooting at us? For how long will they keep our freedom, till
it dies?&icirc; Bashar responded, &igrave;It will never die, even if we
did, our souls won&iacute;t. They would be free. Dying free is better than
living as a slave.&icirc; He held a stone and ran...Others shouted at him
to come back. I eyed Anton and we ran towards him. After about a minute
everybody was with us. We felt that the whole world was staring at us, but
we felt that we were stronger than the whole world. We threw tons of stones
on the soldiers who were accusing an old man. They were just making fun
of him. It was a big insult for our people to make fun of an old man. Would
you like some teenager making fun of your dad? I wouldn&iacute;t. That made
our stones in the eyes of the soldiers look like missiles. They left the
old man and ran after us. We waited for them to approach so we could make
sure than the stones hit them, then we ran. We ran fast; some of us felt
a bit fearful as we saw the bullets passing by our legs. But we ran faster
than the bullets themselves. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The soldiers couldn&iacute;t catch any of us. After a while,
Anton, Bashar and I met in our favourite place. A place where we had all
our lessons about life, a place where we argued and promised to be brothers
forever. We met there and sat for a while. We had a small conversation.
Then...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Ahhhuh ahhhuh...&icirc; Anton breathed fast, &igrave;what
do you think about tonight?&icirc; he asked. &igrave;I think we did a good
job since they left the man alone.&icirc; Bashar said, &igrave;I heard some
people were saying that these children can&iacute;t do anything, they should
go home.&icirc; I said, &igrave;But we did something, no??&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Just facing the enemy is a big victory,&icirc;
Bashar said. Anton was staring at us without saying a word. We asked him
to say something. He then said, &igrave;If you can&iacute;t be a highway,
then be a trail. If you can&iacute;t be the sun just be a star. It isn&iacute;t
by the size that you win or fail. Be the best of whatever you are.&icirc;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;You&iacute;re right, Anton. We will be the best
of whatever we are. Never give up no matter what happens, brothers forever,
promise,&icirc; Bashar said. We all then promised the same. We just wanted
to stand up and leave the place with a smile on everyone&iacute;s face.
Suddenly, somebody came up from behind; Anton looked to see who it was.
Three single, cold shots were taken at Anton. He fell down but managed to
say &igrave;Keep the promise; brothers forever.&icirc; They killed him and
yet his biggest crime was that he loved his country. He died with the smile
on his face. They were never able to kill that smile but actually, it was
the smile that killed them. Anton didn&iacute;t die. He is a lit candle.
He lives with us every single minute. We will never forget his last words.
Those words were my first station in life and the college is one of the
stations that I have to pass to arrive at the final station one day. But
one should always remember that:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If you can&iacute;t be a Highway</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then be a trail</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If you can&iacute;t be the Sun</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just be a star</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It isn&iacute;t by the size you win or fail</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Be the best of whatever you are</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where are the human rights? Where is the United States
blaming Israel? Where is Mrs. Albright standing for her position against
terrorism? Does she even consider that terrorism? Or terrorists can only
come from Palestine? I just wonder when will the world know the sore truth.
When will they know that some of my friends were buried alive. It is more
than anyone&iacute;s imagination. This was a real story that happened to
me and happens everyday in Palestine, but no one mentions it. We are not
allowed to open our mouths; they want us to shut up. We will never shut
up. Even if we had one Palestinian child left, we will fight for our freedom
until we get it. We will never kneel as long as there is a hope in our hearts,
a child in our house and a stone in our hands.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>In Light of Sabra and Shatila</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Vijay Prashad*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The word instigate is used frequently by the monopolistic
media to paint movements of the socially-oppressed with the tar of disapprobation.
When the unfortunate and short-sighted acts of terror took place in Jerusalem
recently, the Israeli and U.S. media quickly blamed the entire Palestinian
nation for instigating violence and for damaging the peace process. Few
recognized the Levant's history of violence (mostly instigated by the colonial
powers, by the early Zionist militia such as the Irgun, and finally by the
turgid policies of pan-Arabists such as Nasser). Israel's first President
Chaim Weizmann once observed that the British informed him that &quot;there
are a few hundred thousand Negroes [in pre-1948 Palestine], but that is
a matter of no significance.&quot; The banal callousness of Weizmann and
the British shows itself in the ferocious brutality inflicted upon the Palestinians
by the Zionists and their Euro-American allies. For the Palestinians, the
Zionist terror is memorialized in the 9 April 1948 Deir Yassin massacre,
wherein Begin's Irgun killed all 254 residents. There are innumerable examples
of murder by Zionists, but one of the incidents that need to be memorialized
as &igrave;murder of Palestinians by proxy&icirc; took place in September
1982 by the Lebanese Falangists. The hallmark of these massacres was that
the Zionist proxy targeted Left-wing and militant Palestinians, something
we need to recognize when we see the paucity of leadership currently available
in Palestine. Driven from Jordan in 1970 and from Syria (in 1976), scores
of Palestinians moved to the outskirts of Beirut into refugee camps. Two
such camps, Sabra and Shatila, housed almost 40,000 people by the early
1980s. Lebanon benefited from the insecurity in West Asia, since most Arabs
used it as a haven for capital (notably, the Gulf sheikhs, but also those
capitalists from Egypt, Syria and Iraq who fled the various socialist experiments).
The service sector (banking, finance, commerce, tourism) accounted for 70%
of Lebanon's GDP, and it ensured an economic boom. The Lebanese state, however,
neglected the project of social justice and the widespread misery among
the working-class and the intermediate classes. A petty, bourgeois Christian-fascist
group, the Falange, took advantage of the state's callousness and expanded
its ranks from 35,000 (1942) to 70,000 (1970). By 1975-1976, the Falange
was the backbone of the regime and in September 1982, a Falangist (and Israeli
ally) was elected the head of state. The Lebanese regime, along with a Multi-national
Force (U.S., France, Italy), ejected the Palestinian fighters from Beirut
and sent them to the camps in the city's vicinity. The Falange was helped
by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), whose leader, Ariel Sharon, said on
12 June 1982 that &quot;we are here to destroy once and for all the PLO
terrorists.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 2 September, a 50 kilogram TNT explosive killed Bashir
Gemayel, the Lebanese ruler. The IDF, in contravention of the commitments
made by U.S. envoy Philip Habib to the PLO, surrounded East Beirut. On 16
September, at 5 p.m., the IDF urged the Falangists to enter the Palestinian
camps and, for the next two days, they held off the press and fleeing Palestinians
as the Falange proceeded to kill over 15,000 people (Israel claims that
only 800 died). Mr. Begin, of Irgun fame, refused to conduct an inquiry
and blamed the events on &quot;the bloodthirsty plot being hatched against
Israel and its government.&quot; 400,000 people protested in Tel Aviv on
25 September and forced the regime to form the Kahane Commission (whose
report relieved Begin of &quot;a certain degree of responsibility&quot;
and called for the dismissal of Sharon and of Raphael Eytan, which did not
happen&oacute;both became members of the Knesset). The Israeli media attempted
to put the blame on the Falange (&quot;organized riff-raff,&quot; said Yediot
Aharonot) without any acknowledgment of Israel's instigation of the massacre.
Edward Said correctly noted in Lebanon that Israel has &quot;behaved like
an international gangster&quot; (al-Hayat, 6 May 1994). Few today (in the
interests of realism) condemn Israel's continued violence in Lebanon and
elsewhere. The U.S., Israel's guardian, did not accept any responsibility
either. Early in 1980, President Jimmy Carter clearly enunciated the U.S.
extraterritorial policy (realized during the 1990-1991 Gulf War and in the
1996 bombings): &quot;Any attempt to take control of the Gulf will be seen
as an attack against the interests of the U.S. and will be resisted by any
means, including military force.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When a ragtag bunch of confused youth conduct violent acts,
we are led to pin the blame for the chaos in West Asia on them. We are taught
to forget U.S.-Israeli-Falange actions and even feel pity for the Israeli
state. Of course, one must grieve for any family that loses loved ones as
a result of acts of terror, but we must simultaneously recognize the structural
violence faced by the Palestinians since 1948 (particularly as they enter
the Golden Jubilee of that other British instigated partition). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let us, with Mahmoud Darwish, picture West Asia in the
fullness of its tragedy and not with the intent to blame the victims of
Zionism:I saw nothing but a scaffoldWith one single rope for two million
necksI see armed cities of paper that bristleWith kings and khaki</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Syria Leads the Arab World in Turning</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>the Tables on &quot;Israel's&quot; Regional
Policies</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When Benyamin Netanyahu announced (right before the 30
July bombing in Jerusalem) the closing of the book on the 'Lebanon-first
option', meaning negotiating a separate deal with Lebanon, or even negotiating
withdrawal from South Lebanon, in exchange for a 'peace treaty' with Syria,
it was tantamount to a declaration of failure of the policy to circumvent
an Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights. It also set the stage
for the most recent vengeance wreaked on Lebanon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the official Arab level, however, Egypt and Saudi Arabia
have moved much closer to the Syrian position in the last few months, culminating
in a Saudi announcement calling for a boycott of the al-Doha Economic Summit
in Qatar, which aims to continue the process of insinuating the Zionist
entity into the economic structure of the region, in spite of the halt of
the so-called 'peace process'.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Syrian-Iraqi Rapprochement</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the recent Syrian moves to open up and resume relations
with Iraq were definitely the most interesting in view of the fierce rivalry
and animosity that has permeated relations between the two neighbouring
Arab states for the past two decades.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, Syrians are again allowed to travel into Iraq, and
trade between the two countries has begun to flourish. Dozens of Syrian
businessmen traverse across the border into Iraq in search of lucrative
deals. Before that, an Iraqi industrial commission was welcomed into Damascus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Iraqi delegation's visit to Damascus concurred with
two events protesting the Turkish invasion of northern Iraq: one was held
by Palestinian opposition groups in the Yarmouk Refugee Camp in Damascus,
and the other, which was heavily attended by Syrian citizens, took place
in the quarters of the Arab Writers Union. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Iraq had first shut down an anti-Syrian regime radio station
which had been broadcasting from Baghdad since the 1970s. Then Thanaa Imam,
a correspondent for Radio Monte Carlo in Damascus, relayed that the recent
leadership of the Baath party in Syria has been contemplating a reciprocal
shut-down of an anti-Iraqi regime radio station in Damascus which has probably
taken place by now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Saddam Hussein announced that the Baath party
in Iraq was proposing a dialogue with the Iraqi opposition leading to power-sharing,
and the incorporation of the latter into the government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Subsequently, Saddam met with an envoy of the Kurdish leader
At-Talbani, and approached Majed Abdul-Ridda, a former member of the Central
Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party and a political science professor
at Baghdad University, regarding inclusion in the government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More important, two separate delegations, one Russian and
the other Chinese, held a series of meetings with several parties from the
Iraqi opposition in Damascus to arrange for a comprehensive national Iraqi
dialogue. THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN ON SYRIAN SOIL WITHOUT THE IMPLICIT BLESSING
OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, when the United Nations bureaucracy began
to deliberately delay the approval of Syrian shipments of food and medicine
to Iraq because of U.S. and U.K. intervention, under the Oil for Food plan,
Syria went ahead and shipped the perfectly legal and agreed-upon items ANYWAY,
thus setting an example for how one Arab country should act toward another.
Syria is an independent state. It gained its independence from the French
in 1946, and it's not about to take orders from colonialists again, especially
when it comes to harming another Arab country.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Background of the Syrian Policy Shift</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Needless to say, all these developments did not come from
a vacuum. The coming of Netanyahu to power in &quot;Israel&quot;, the escalation
of the already ongoing settlement projects, the refusal to withdraw from
South Lebanon, the insistence of holding onto the Golan Heights, the resumption
of attacks against South Lebanon, and Israel&iacute;s retreat from the mutual
agreement that supposedly developed behind closed doors to withdraw from
the Golan and South Lebanon, all pushed Syria towards Iraq and Iran.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Though the threat of an &quot;Israeli&quot; blitzkrieg
attack against Syria loomed large, American foreign policy became ever more
pro-Israeli. Examples abound with the U.S. consistently voting with &quot;Israel&quot;
in the U.N. against not only the Arabs but also the rest of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then there's Congress voting overwhelmingly, on 10 June,
to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The following week,
the Senate passed legislation which, if enacted into law, would prohibit
most financial transactions with Syria, thus adding Syria to the list of
Arab countries suffering from sanctions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before that, the Syrians noted with alarm that the State
Department's 'Annual Report on Terrorism' criticized Syria for hosting several
anti-Oslo Agreement Palestinian groups on Syrian soil.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It became perfectly clear that American foreign policy
in the region has become a mere extension of &quot;Israel's&quot; Arab and
Islamic policy. Not only are Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross Zionist
Jews, but practically the whole concept of the New Middle East has been
marketed as the prosperous outcome of the misnomer 'peace process' and is
no more than a veneer for &quot;Israeli&quot; regional hegemony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, &quot;Israel&quot; can only achieve that
hegemony by breaking up existing Arab states into even smaller units and
then foster internal civil and religious warfare. And so, under the deceiving
motto of 'religious freedom', the State Department officially adopted a
malicious plan for the further fragmentation of the Middle East, and, as
far as that goes, even the puppet regimes got the point.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Turkish-Israeli Unholy Alliance</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The nucleus of this New Middle East is to be based on a
Turkish-Israeli alliance, and in the not-so-distant future, to include the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Since Turkey lies on the northern borders of
Syria, Iraq and Iran, alarm bells began to ring, especially after the Turkish
excursion into northern Iraq, while the international community watched
gleefully and in total silence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a result of this political-military alliance, Israeli
jets undertook airborne maneuvers right next to northern Syrian airspace.
Israeli gunboats did the same in front of the Syrian coastline. Surrounded
and outnumbered, Syria could have chosen to capitulate, as others have done
so easily, but that's not how it's done!! However, that second higher road
goes right through Baghdad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before that, Turkey began taking measures to restrict the
water lifelines of Syria and Iraq as part of a plan to build some 17 dams
on the Tigris and Euphrates. That not only sets Syria and Iraq in a common
front, but threatens even Sudan, as the purpose here is to eventually become
the main agricultural supplier of the New Middle East, and to sell what
would otherwise have been Arab water to the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia.
Political leverage generated thereof on the Arabs is a mere 'coincidence'.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Implication for Cyprus</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Not only was this new Turkish-Israeli alliance blessed
by the U.S. State Department, but several active steps were pursued by American
foreign policy makers to resolve the Greek-Turkish conflict, specifically
the Cypriot issue, after more than two decades of long neglect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This was done purposely to deprive Arab states from Greece
as an anti-Turkish ally. With appropriate American pressure, suddenly Turkey
began to show a new flexibility on Cyprus; this strengthened Israel's hand
even against Egypt, which had earlier signed an agreement for military cooperation
with Greece in response to the Turkish-Israeli alliance.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A Syrian-Iraqi-Iranian Axis?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Consequently, several voices emerged demanding the formation
of a new Syrian-Iraqi-Iranian axis. Laith Shubailatt, a leading and very
popular opposition figure in Jordan, wrote an open letter of congratulations
to the newly elected Iranian president to encourage the establishment of
such an axis. The Arab Nationalist Conference, based in Beirut and representing
many prestigious and independent nationalist intellectuals, endorsed such
an axis. Even Dr. Ramadan Abdullah, the head of the Palestinian Islamic
Jihad, endorsed such an axis as one that would definitely impede neocolonial
and Zionist plans to reabsorb the Arab and Islamic world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A surprise visit by President Hafez Al-Asaad to Iran followed,
and a series of concomitant moves to open up with the Iraqi neighbour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, regardless of whether such an axis comes about
or not, it is certain that right now Syria is potentially in the eye of
the storm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is the most targeted at this moment because of its ability
to tilt the balance in either direction and because of its refusal to meekly
go along with Zionist plans in the region as others have shamelessly done.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore Syria is being threatened with sanctions, sieges
and even direct aggression under this or that pretext; it is the national
obligation of all decent Arabs to align themselves with Syria in this confrontation,
as well as with all Arab states under siege such as Iraq, Libya and Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Recognizing the importance of internal cohesion, the Syrian
government took steps to allow the exiled and fleeing members and leaders
of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood back into the country upon mediation
from friendly Arab and Islamic parties, especially from Jordan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps Saddam Hussein's attempts to start a dialogue with
the Iraqi opposition are part of a similar strategy in Iraq! Either way,
all Arab governments under siege should realize the need and importance
of internal reform and democracy as a means to successfully fight Zionist
and colonial plans against them.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Getting Respect in the U.S.</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By David McLau</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I recommend that you play along and adopt a strategy which
will stress the importance of national security for U.S. interests&oacute;about
how important it is for the U.S. not to make enemies in the Arab world now
that the Cold War is over. &quot;Why do we need Israel, etc. etc..?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This would be an important and quick method to change American
public opinion, in addition to what you already do. Last week there was
an editorial in the Boston Globe, for example, that called on Albright to
either put pressure on Israel, settle the matter, or else get out of the
peace-broker business entirely. And this, I think, is what will eventually
happen in a few years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S., after being discredited, will be forced to turn
the matter over to the United Nations and this will give the Palestinians
a much better prospect. All the PA has to do is hold out, play along and
pretend like they want peace, and of course don't settle for anything less
than what they want. The U.N. partition line of 1947 might be a good opener
as well as U.N. resolution 194. Eventually the American public opinion will
change and knock the legs out from under Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The very fact that Albright has rejected the Israeli proposal
to proceed directly to the final status talks is a major victory. It means
that Albright must now put pressure on Israel to complete the next Oslo
II pullout before final status talks begin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I also suggest that Arafat eventually consider a &quot;national
unity&quot;-type government with Hamas participating on a 50/50 basis. This
could be argued as a step toward true democracy, a voice for all. But, this
one act alone would hasten along the eventual pullout of the U.S. from the
peace-broker business, since it would make a final status settlement impossible,
and this is the politicians&iacute; worst nightmare. First, the PA would
have to obtain security guarantees with its European allies, such as France,
and also maintain good public support in the U.S. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I predict that in 20 years, after U.S. aid to Israel is
long since cut off, economic reality and available resources will force
a combined national unity between all people there, except it won't be called
Israel anymore; it will be Palestine. About half of the Jews will move to
the good life in the U.S., where about 1 million Israelis already live.
Palestine would be left with a true democracy with about 6 million Arabs
and about 2 million remaining Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And now for something on the far side. Remember those suitcase-size
nuclear bombs that were in the news and are unaccounted for in Russia last
week? If there could be some credible story published somewhere that some
of them may have made their way to the Middle East, believe me, Palestinians
would get much more respect in Europe and the U.S. The demand for a settlement
would escalate greatly, and thus the eventual pullout of the U.S. from the
peace process and more pressure on Israel. Of course, all Arab governments
could deny that they have the missing suitcases.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>About this Khazarian Moskowitz</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>&quot;He is not even of Semitic origin!&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. David McLau also sent us the following comment on the
Jewish American millionaire Moskowitz who funds the Jewish settlement activities
in Occupied Jerusalem. His comment was also attached to some relevant excerpts
from a book written by the Jewish author Dr. Alfred M. Lilienthal. Mr. McLau
says:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact of the matter is that this Moskowitz character
is nothing more than a descendant of a Khazarian convert from the 8th century
AD, when this ancient European kingdom of Serbian and Turkish ethnic people
converted to Judaism upon the decree of their king. Descendants of this
Khazar empire now make up 85% of all of the Jews of the world today, of
which Mr. Moskowitz is one. I'll bet he probably thinks that, by buying
up all of this Palestinian land, he is carrying forward the seed of his
supposed ancestor, Abraham. Nothing could be farther from the truth. He
is not even Semitic! Moskowitz is nothing more than a descendant of a European
convert to the religion. It is the greatest fraud of the century which Zionists
have committed upon both America and themselves, since they now actually
believe that they are returning to the land of their ancestors! Please read
the excellent article from the Jewish author, Dr. Alfred M. Lilienthal,
What Price 'Israel'?, which I have pasted in below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Alfred M. Lilienthal, historian, journalist and lecturer,
is a graduate of Cornell University and Columbia Law School. During the
Second World War, he served with the U.S. Army in the Middle East. He later
served with the Department of State, and as a consultant to the American
delegation at the organizational meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since 1947, he has been at the forefront in the struggle
for a balanced U.S. policy in the Middle East. He is the author of several
acclaimed books on the Middle East, including The Zionist Connection. He
now lives in Washington, DC</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish Race?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Dr. Alfred M. Lilienthal</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Today, to trace anyone's descent to ancient Palestine would
be a genealogical impossibility; and to presume, axiomatically, such a descent
for Jews, alone among all human groups, is an assumption of purely fictional
significance. Most everybody in the Western world could stake out some claim
of Palestinian descent if genealogical records could be established for
two-thousand years. And there are, indeed, people who, though not by the
widest stretch of imagination Jewish, proudly make that very claim: some
of the oldest of the South's aristocratic families play a game of comparing
whose lineage goes farther back into 'Israel'. No one knows what happened
to the Ten Lost Tribes of 'Israel', but to speculate on who might be who
is a favored Anglo-Saxon pastime, and Queen Victoria belonged to an 'Israelite'
Society that traced the ancestry of its membership back to those lost tribes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Twelve tribes started in Canaan about thirty-five centuries
ago; and not only that ten of them disappeared - more than half of the members
of the remaining two tribes never returned from their &quot;exile&quot;
in Babylon. How then, can anybody claim to descend directly from that relatively
small community which inhabited the Holy Land at the time of Abraham's Covenant
with God?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jewish racial myth flows from the fact that the words
Hebrew, 'Israelite', Jew, Judaism, and the Jewish people have been used
synonymously to suggest a historic continuity. But this is a misuse. These
words refer to different groups of people with varying ways of life in different
periods in history. Hebrew is a term correctly applied to the period from
the beginning of Biblical history to the settling in Canaan. 'Israelite'
refers correctly to the members of the twelve tribes of 'Israel'. The name
Yehudi or Jew is used in the Old Testament to designate members of the tribe
of Judah, descendants of the fourth son of Jacob, as well as to denote citizens
of the Kingdom of Judah, particularly at the time of Jeremiah and under
the Persian occupation. Centuries later, the same word came to be applied
to anyone, no matter of what origin, whose religion was Judaism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps the most significant mass conversion to the Judaic
faith occurred in Europe, in the 8th century A.D., and that story of the
Khazars (Turko-Finnish people) is quite pertinent to the establishment of
the modern State of 'Israel'. This partly nomadic people, probably related
to the Volga Bulgars, first appeared in Trans-Caucasia in the second century.
They settled in what is now Southern Russia, between the Volga and the Don,
and then spread to the shores of the Black, Caspian and Azov seas. The Kingdom
of Khazaria, ruled by a khagan or khakan fell to Attila the Hun in 448,
and to the Muslims in 737. In between, the Khazars ruled over part of the
Bulgarians, conquered the Crimea, and stretched their kingdom over the Caucasus
farther to the northwest to include Kiev, and eastwards to Derbend.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The influence of the Khazars extended into what is now
Hungary and Roumania. Today, the villages of Kozarvar and Kozard in Transylvania
bear testimony to the penetration of the Khazars who, with the Magyars,
then proceeded into present-day Hungary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jews who had been banished from Constantinople by the Byzantine
ruler, Leo III, found a home amongst these heretofore pagan Khazars and,
in competition with Mohammedan and Christian missionaries, won them over
to the Judaic faith. Bulan, the ruler of Khazaria, became converted to Judaism
around 740 A.D. His nobles and, somewhat later, his people followed suit.
Some details of these events are contained in letters exchanged between
Khagan Joseph of Khazaria and R. Hasdai Ibn Shaprut of Cordova, doctor and
quasi foreign minister to Sultan Abd al-Rahman, the Caliph of Spain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Under the rule of Obadiah, Judaism gained further strength
in Khazaria. Synagogues and schools were built to give instruction in the
Bible and the Talmud. As Professor Graetz notes in his History of the Jews,
&quot;A successor of Bulan who bore the Hebrew name of Obadiah was the first
to make serious efforts to further the Jewish religion. He invited Jewish
sages to settle in his dominions, rewarded them royally... and introduced
a divine service modeled on the ancient communities. After Obadiah came
a long series of Jewish Chagans (Khagans), for according to a fundamental
law of the state only Jewish rulers were permitted to ascend the throne.&quot;
Khazar traders brought not only silks and carpets of Persia and the Near
East but also their Judaic faith to the banks of the Vistula and the Volga.
But the Kingdom of Khazaria was invaded by the Russians, and Itil, its great
capital, fell to Sweatoslav of Kiev in 969. The Byzantines had become afraid
and envious of the Khazars and, in a joint expedition with the Russians,
conquered the Crimean portion of Khazaria in 1016. (Crimea was known as
&quot;Chazaria&quot; until the 13th century). The Khazarian Jews were scattered
throughout what is now Russia and Eastern Europe. Some were taken North
where they joined the established Jewish community of Kiev.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Others returned to the Caucasus. Many Khazars remarried
in the Crimea and in Hungary. The Cagh Chafut, or &quot;mountain Jews,&quot;
in the Caucasus and the Hebraile Jews of Georgia are their descendants.
These &quot;Ashkenazim Jews&quot; (as Jews of Eastern Europe are called),
whose numbers were swelled by Jews who fled from Germany at the time of
the Crusades and during the Black Death, have little or no trace of Semitic
blood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That the Khazars are the lineal ancestors of Eastern European
Jewry is a historical fact. Jewish historians and religious text books acknowledge
the fact, though the propagandists of Jewish nationalism belittle it as
pro-Arab propaganda. Somewhat ironically, Volume IV of the Jewish Encyclopedia
- because this publication spells Khazars with a &quot;C&quot; instead of
a &quot;K&quot; - is titled &quot;Chazars to Dreyfus&quot;: and it was the
Dreyfus trial, as interpreted by Theodor Herzl, that made the modern Jewish
Khazars of Russia forget their descent from converts to Judaism and accept
anti-Semitism as proof of their Palestinian origin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For all that anthropologists know, Arafat's ancestry might
go back to one of the Tribes of 'Israel'; while Weizmann may be a descendant
of the Khazars, the converts to Judaism who were in no anthropological respect
related to Palestine. The home to which Weizmann, Silver and so many other
Ashkenazim Zionists have yearned to return has most likely never been theirs.
&quot;Here's a paradox, a paradox, a most ingenious paradox&quot;: in anthropological
fact, many Christians may have much more Hebrew-'Israelite' blood in their
veins than most of their Jewish neighbors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Race can play funny tricks on people who make that concept
the basis for their likes and dislikes. Race-obsessed people can find themselves
hating people who, in fact, may be their own racial kith and kin.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Non-Muslims see the beauty of Islam</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In today's rat race, we find so many people believing that
the solution to their problems is money. So, they work very hard to earn
money as well as a high education, yet too many forget about letting the
dove of faith perch peacefully in their hearts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Arabs and Muslims from every nationality have joined
in this rat race with the rest of the world. Many of them imitate America
while at the same time throwing away the jewel of Islam. However, this jewel
is being discovered and coveted by Westerners who have seen the beauty,
solitude and strength of the real Islam. This real Islam is demonstrated
so clearly and beautifully in the Qur'an and hadiths of Prophet Mohammed
(peace and blessings be upon him). Unfortunately, it is not alive in the
everyday culture of the people as it should be, even though remnants remain
in certain actions within the culture. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In America and throughout the European countries, many
are becoming Muslim. They have found that money cannot buy everything, and
it does not solve all of their problems. Many are lost in the West; they
are searching for peace and happiness; many are looking to Islam. It is
considered to be the fastest growing religion in the world. Statistically,
America has between 6 million and 10 million Muslims. In the whole world
there are over 1 billion Muslims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is sad that many Muslims, in particular Arabs and those
who were born as Muslims, view Islam as an anchor that is holding them back
from the Western ideas of success. This attitude must change if Muslims
are to save themselves. We must realize that Islam has a strength that evil-doers
fear and that they cannot shake. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The amazing thing about Islam is the fact that not only
Muslims and converted Muslims see its beauty and strength. Non-Muslims have
said many good things about Islam and about Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The following are some of the nice things said by non-Muslims:
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, though an atheist,
stated that &quot;If a man like Mohammed were to assume the dictatorship
of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems that would
bring it the much needed peace and happiness.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shaw also stated that &quot;If any religion has a chance
of conquering England, nay Europe, within the next hundred years, that religion
is Islam.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Michael Hart, the author of &quot;The 100: A Ranking of
the Most Influential Persons in History,&quot; states, &quot;My choice of
Mohammed to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may surprise
some&quot;... &quot;but he was supremely successful on both the religious
and secular levels.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Rao, a Hindu Philosopher, said that &quot;In the person
of the Prophet of Islam the world has seen [the] rarest phenomenon on earth,
walking in flesh and blood.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gibbon, author of &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&quot;
states that &quot;The creed of Mohammed is free from the suspicions of ambiguity
and the Qur&iacute;an is a glorious testimony to the unity of God.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mahatma Gandhi said, &quot;The more I study, the more I
discover that the strength of Islam does not lie in the sword.&quot; Also,
Pandit Gyanandra Dev Sharma Shastri concurs by stating, &quot;The only 'sword'
Muhammed wielded was the sword of mercy, compassion, friendship and forgiveness&oacute;the
sword that conquers enemies and purifies their hearts. His sword was sharper
than the sword of steel.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Philosopher Thomas Caryle said, &quot;If you doubt the
truth of Islam, you should doubt matters that are self-evident and of necessity
true, because the most self-evident and necessary truth is Islam.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Prince Bismarck said about the Qur'an: &quot;No other work
will serve man's happiness like this&quot; and &quot;It is self-evident
that the Qur'an is the word of God.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Japanese Commander-in-Chief who defeated Russia to the
validity of Islam said, &quot;History shows that the Muslims increased in
civilization and progressed in relation to the power of the truths of Islam;
that is, to the degree that they acted in accordance with that power. And
history also shows that they fell into savagery and decline, and disaster
and defeat amidst utter confusion to the degree of their weakness in adhering
to the truths of Islam.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If atheists, Christians and others who do not believe in
Islam can still say good things about Islam and the Prophet, then there
must be truth and beauty in Islam. Islam is like honey and attracts so many.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let us remember the words of a Kurdish Muslim, Said Nursi,
who said, &quot;If the jewel of true religion is not present in the shell
of the heart, material, moral and spiritual calamities of untold magnitude
will break loose over mankind and they will become the most unhappy, the
most wretched of animals.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let us drink from the fountain of Islam to gain our strength,
otherwise we will cause our own self-destruction. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Lad Who Dared To Dream</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Once upon a time there lived a youth in the Land of Dreams.
Every day, he would sit quietly in a green meadow, listen to the hum of
nature, gaze into the blue of the sky and dream. His dreams were rainbows
and contained every imaginable color, every delectable scent, every delightful
texture, and the sighs of angels. No one disturbed the lad, for he lived
in the Land of Dreams and it was quite normal to see a citizen dream.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One day the youth felt pulled by an irresistible urge to
travel to a strange land, a place where he had never been before. He set
off on a boat and when the liner pulled anchor, he lovingly gazed at his
beloved country and said, &quot;Farewell my beloved Land of Dreams. I shall
return as soon as I have learned about life in this strange land I am traveling
to.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He stayed on deck drinking in every last image of his country
until it disappeared into a speck of his imagination. Gone were the rolling
green hills, the fertile valleys, the lush forests, the lakes steeped with
fish and the life that allowed one to have the time to sit and stare at
nature and to just dream.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At last, after weeks of travel, the ship the lad was traveling
on set shore. The youth had spent a long time staring at the strange land
from a distance, trying to absorb all he could from far away. He noticed
that instead of green rolling hills, the earth appeared parched and dry
and that no apparent forests existed. Water surely must be scarce as the
only visible vegetation was a few palm trees and some wilted flowers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As soon as he set foot on the land, he noticed a wet blanket
of heat suddenly envelop him. The sun was bright and oppressive. He stood
on one spot, taking a deep breath and letting the sounds and odors of the
nearby market soak in. He stared at the people of this parched island. They
all seemed the color of arid sand. His gaze shifted to their abodes and
though some were grand and elaborately decorated, most reflected the color
of the dry drab earth. Normally used to a blue sky, he noticed that it seemed
to mirror the gray homes and people. Even the blue of the sea had faded
and looked more a muddy brown than anything else. The market smelled like
spices and the sound of the noon buyers mingled with the din of traffic.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was almost too much for him. There was an uneasy feeling
in the air and this certainly didn't remind him of the home he was so used
to. Nevertheless, he had come for adventure and to seek knowledge so he
did not want any misconceptions or prejudices to blind him. He decided to
wander about the market place and soak in the essence of the people and
their land. He was pushed and shoved and found himself suddenly very hot
and tired. His gaze took him to a hill in the distance so he bought some
apples and set off for the hill where he expected to find peace and to be
alone with himself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally at the top of the hill, where a few flowers grew
and some sparse trees cast what little shade they had to offer on the lad,
the boy sat down and ate a few of his apples. It wasn't long before he began
to daydream of home and other beautiful thoughts. Suddenly, without realizing
what was going on, he felt the hands of several police grab him and shout
such senseless things as, &quot;Hey, look what this lad is doing! He's daydreaming.
Everyone knows that to daydream is a criminal offense. Let's throw him in
prison before anyone else is influenced by his bad behavior and starts to
dream too.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So the lad was handcuffed and gagged like a common criminal
and carried off to a rusty old fortress that was unfit for animals much
less human habitation. He was pulled and shoved into a dark underground
cell where hardly any light was visible. The stench almost knocked him over
and the heat was too overpowering. He tried to escape and to break away
from this insanity but the strong arms of the law were too much for him.
He had spent most of his young life reading books and investigating hidden
caves and wading in the cool rivers fed by mountain lakes so he had no power
to resist those who had used force as a way of life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He tried to protest to his captors by saying, &quot;Hey,
wait a minute! Just what is it that I have done wrong? I am guilty of nothing.
I demand to see a lawyer and be given a fair trial. You can't throw me down
here to die&Ouml;away from the sun and freedom!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But all he got was a rough slap on the face and a shove
into a dank black cell. He fell on the floor and it was sometime before
he could make out three other figures in the room. They made no attempt
to approach him or speak to him so he said in a quivering voice, &quot;Hello!
What are you doing here? What are you guilty of. Did you dare to dream too?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At first no one answered. Then a raggedy old man gasped
out, &quot;I am here for stealing a loaf of bread!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A second much younger person said, &quot;I am here for
daring to ask for an increase in wages.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And the third, a deaf and mute person made signs with his
hands that he was arrested and detained because he did not answer the questions
he was asked when he jay walked across the street.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The lad was stunned. These certainly were not dangerous
criminals and certainly did not deserve to be thrown in a dungeon and shut
away from life and the smell and taste of freedom! How long would he be
detained here? Surely under such conditions he would die. Under such conditions,
death would be a blessing and a luxury!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Days passed unbearably by. The lad could barely stand the
heat and the stench of awaiting death and poor rations of horrible tasting
food. But the hardest thing for him to endure was to not be able to see
the sky and the sun and the moon and the stars. How could he ever dream
again without them? But dreams now were his only hope and means to survive,
so he would withdraw into a corner of the room and begin to dream of all
the beautiful things he could think of such as an enchanted forest and birds
singing in evergreen trees, and a lake made of jade just waiting for him
to swim, and the sound of the sea and the rush of the tides just in the
distance. Whenever he would dream so, his cellmates would stare at him and
say, &quot;Say boy, why do you have this beautiful look on your face. There
isn't anything here to make you happy!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All he could say was, &quot;There is more than you will
ever know. I am dreaming of all the beautiful things I can imagine in life
and that is why I can be so happy in such a miserable place. If I didn't
have my dreams, I would surely die!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At last, after a year of imprisonment, the lad was set
free along with his cellmates under a general pardon granted by the emperor
of the island who happened to be in a good and generous mood. The first
thing the lad did when he walked out the prison door was to squint at the
sun and stare at the blue of the sky. Somehow, even on this desolate island,
it was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But he knew he could not stay one moment longer in this
barren place, for his life was built on dreams and he could not stop dreaming!
What would he be without his dreams? Why, nothing!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So he jumped on the first freighter that came his way and
worked his way across the ocean. At long last, his little boat anchored
on the shores of his beautiful land. He hopped of the boat and the first
thing he did was kiss the ground and say, &quot;Oh, thank God for returning
me home safe to my beloved country! Now I can dream without fear of arrest!&quot;
He inhaled deeply, he inhaled freedom. He took a deep whiff of his country's
air&Ouml;he smelled freedom. He could touch it and taste it and feel it
everywhere. It was blue satin and all the colors of the rainbow and sweeter
than the sighs of angels!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The lad went on to dream for the rest of his life. The
results were the age of technology for nothing was too grand for the boy
to dream of. But he would never forget the desolate island where dreaming
was considered a criminal offense but more than that, he felt great compassion
and pity for the inhabitants of that desert place who never had the freedom
or pleasure of knowing what it means to dream.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Nabi Rubin Before 1948</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village was located on the south bank of the Rubin
River, 3 km away from the Mediterranean. For Palestinians al-Nabi Rubin
had great significance because it was the site of a shrine for al-Nabi (the
Prophet) Rubin, who was honored with an annual mawsim (pilgrimage season),
during which Islamic and popular celebrations were held. In the Judaic tradition
Rubin (or Reuben) was the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah and was known
for his scrupulous honesty, in contrast with his half-brother, Esau; while
Esau looted and plundered the property of others, Reuben would not even
collect plants from a field unless he knew they were ownerless (Genesis
30:14). It was not uncommon for Palestinian Muslims to honor such Old Testament
prophets by building shrines for them; there was a shrine for the prophet
Moses, for example, south of Jericho, not far from the region in which he
is said to have been buried. It is thought that the shrine for al-Nabi Rubin
was built in the same place where a Canaanite temple once had stood, and
that the mawsim itself was pagan in origin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The mawsim lasted from July through September and was one
of two prominent mawsims for Old Testament prophets in Palestine-the other
being dedicated to al-Nabi Musa (the prophet Moses). People flocked to the
shrine from Jaffa, Lydda, al-Ramla, and the region's villages. They sang
religious as well as secular/popular songs; danced the dabka; held dhikr
sessions (Islamic devotional exercises led by adherents of Sufi mysticism);
watched horse races and magic shows; and listened to preachers or zajjals
(popular poets). [Sirhan 1989:565-66] The participants camped in tents and
were served refreshments at makeshift cafes and restaurants. They shopped
for wares at booths that entrepreneurs set up for the occasion .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village itself was inhabited by members of the Abu
Sawayrih tribe, descendants of the al-Maliha Bedouin who had lived in the
Sinai. The village's land area, most of which was covered by sand dunes,
was the second largest in the district after that of Yibna, and was designated
as an Islamic waqf (pious endowment). Some of the houses, which were scattered
across the site without any discernible nucleus, were also built inside
the fruit orchards. Shops as well as a movie theater were built in the neighborhood
of the shrine. Water was provided by wells and springs. The population of
al-Nabi Rubin was predominantly Muslim. An elementary school for boys was
established in the village in 1946, with an enrollment of fifty-six students
in the mid-1940s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The villagers worked in agriculture and animal husbandry;
they also catered to the visitors during the mawsim. They cultivated mainly
grain, followed by citrus and other fruits, such as figs and grapes. In
1945 a total of 683 dunums</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>was devoted to citrus and bananas and 4,357 dunums were
allocated to cereals; 184 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards. Eucalyptus
and chinaberry trees grew along the river bank and covered large portions
of village land. On the far southwest edge of the land lay Manarat Rubin
(&quot;The Lighthouse of Reuben&quot;), which was built over the ruins of
the old port of Yibna (the lamnitarum Portus of Roman times). Recent excavations
there have located a squarish, beaten-earth rampart measuring 800 m on a
side that dates to the second millennium B.C.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Circumstantial evidence indicates that the village was
occupied during the second stage of the Israeli army's Operation Barak (see
al-Batani al-Gharbi, Gaza District). Israeli historian Benny Morris reports
that the villagers were expelled on 1 June 1948, three days before the villagers
of nearby Yibna were forced to leave their homes. The expulsions were in
keeping with the practice of the Giv'ati Brigade under its commander Shim'on
Avidan and in accordance with the Haganah's Plan Dalet.[M:xvii; see M:127]</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Settlements on Village Lands</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1949, Zionists established Kibbutz Palmachim (122149)
on the coastal lands of the village, south of the mouth of the Rubin River.
They also established the settlement of Gan Soreq (127150) in 1950, 3.5
km west of the shrine, on village land.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Village Today</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The shrine of al-Nabi Rubin stands amid shrubs and other
wild vegetation. A minaret that has three lancet-arched entrances stands
at one end of it (see photo). A number of minor shrines built of large stones
also remain. Near the shrine is a deserted, free-standing cement structure
that consists of a single, box-shaped room.</FONT></P>
