<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Zionist police gang up on peaceful demonstrators
in Jerusalem</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- <b>Special to PT</p>

<p></b>Underscoring Jewish racist attitudes toward non-Jews, Israeli police attacked and
violently suppressed a peaceful demonstration by thousands of so-called Israeli- Arabs
(Palestinians who hold the Israeli citizenship) in Jerusalem on 24 November, injuring
scores of protesters.<br>
The protesters, who included local councils&#146; heads, Knesset members and civic leaders
as well as ordinary citizens arrived in buses in Jerusalem from all across Palestinian
towns occupied by Zionist gangs in 1948. And their goal was to protest the financial
plight of their towns and villages and official Israeli economic discrimination against
the 1200,000-strong Arab community in Israel.<br>
However, as the estimated three thousand protesters sought to make their voice heard, by
chanting slogans against government policy, the police attacked them savagely, using
batons and other riot gear, injuring as many as twenty demonstrators.<br>
Among the injured were Muhammad Zeidan, Chairman of the Arab leadership&#146;s monitoring
committee, which is comprised of council heads, MPs, and leading figures in Israel&#146;s
Palestinian community.<br>
Moreover, Knesset Member Ahmed Teibi was hospitalized after police reportedly beat him.<br>
However, in another telling development, Teibi was attacked at his hospital bed by several
thugs from the terrorist group, known as Kach, who sought to beat and humiliate him.<br>
According to Teibi, Police arrived at the hospital on three hours after the hoodlums had
arrived and made their point.<br>
The situation opposite the Prime Minister&#146;s office, where the demonstrators gathered,
became particularly nasty around 11:00 am, as policemen equipped with batons and
truncheons abruptly and without any warning attacked demonstrators head-on, injuring
Teibi, and two other Arab Knesset member, Muhammad Baraka and Azmi Beshara.<br>
One demonstrator suffered a broken hand, while another fainted and was transferred to
hospital.<br>
&#147;The police brutally beat the demonstrators, council heads, women and Knesset
members. I was in the front row and I was punched and took several blows in the stomach
and on the shoulders and arms from batons,&#148; Teibi told the Israeli state-run radio on
25 November. <br>
Teibi accused the police of deliberately and premeditatedly attacking the peaceful
demonstrators.<br>
&#147;They did it with vindictiveness and hatred as if they were seeking to settle
accounts with us,&#148; adding that &#147;They wouldn&#146;t behave in this way if the
demonstrators were Jews.&#148; <br>
Abdul Malik Dahamshe, another Arab Knesset member, also criticized Police brutality toward
&#147;Arab citizens of Israel.&#148;<br>
&#147;When the police faces Arab demonstrators, it like facing enemy forces&#133;but this
will not lessen our determination to challenge this enduring and institutionalized racist
discrimination against us.&#148;<br>
Talab al Saneh, who represent the Arabs of the southern region of Palestine, the Negev,
said the police were behaving in a disgraceful way.<br>
&#147;Instead of sending officials to listen to us and hear our demands, they sent their
crack police to beat us &#133;.they think that the police repression is the solution, but
they are wrong, there are real problems to be solved.&#148;<br>
Later on, the United Arab list and Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, the two main
political Arab parties in Israel, issued a joint statement, denouncing police brutality.<br>
The statement said the Zionist police acted in a brutal and violent manner, calling the
repression of the demonstration a &#147;disgrace to Israeli democracy.&#148;<br>
Meanwhile, the Arab sector in Israel observed a general strike on 24 November during which
All-municipal services came to a halt.<br>
Earlier, several Arab leaders representing various political orientations had threatened
to dispatch delegates to Arab capitals in an effort to recruit financial assistance to
their financially broken towns and villages. <br>
The root cause of this enduring crisis, which engulfs the entirety of the Arab sector, is
the official Israeli discrimination against Arab in the Jewish state.<br>
According Professor Majid Haja Yahya, Professor of Sociology at Haifa University, this
discrimination didn&#146;t start yesterday and was not a passing phenomenon.<br>
&#147;Discrimination against the Arab community in Israel is a build-in phenomenon that
goes back to the establishment of Israel itself over a half century ago,&#148; he said.<br>
He pointed out that while Arabs in the Jewish state makes up to 22% of the population,
they only receive less than five per cent of the financial resources allocated to local
council in the Jewish state.<b> </b></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Final status talks open amid sharp differences</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and the Palestinian Authority began the so-called final status
talks earlier this month amid sharp differences over the most fundamental and sensitive
issues of the Arab-Israeli conflict&#151;Jerusalem, the refugees and Jewish settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two-hour session of formal talks, which took place in Ramallah on the
West Bank on 10 November, was aimed at trying to map out an agenda for hard negotiations
the two sides hope to wrap up in ten months. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, while the Ramallah talks were described by both parties as
&#147;practical and business-like&#148;, the policy statements delivered by the heads of
the two delegations, Yasser Abed Rabbou and Odid Eran, revealed and underscored the
clearly wide gap between the two sides&#146; perceptions and stances on virtually all
outstanding contentious issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his speech, the text of which was later circulated to reporters, Abed
Rabbou demanded full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders, calling this &#147;an
absolute requirement for peace.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Without the return by Israel of all of the land acquired by
war in 1967, including Jerusalem, our efforts will amount to no more than deferral of
crises.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, Abed Rabbou pointed out that in order for peace to take root
and prevail, a prompt end should be put to Jewish settlement expansion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, Abed Rabbou reminded the Israeli delegation that the
refugees&#146; enduring cause was a paramount matter for the Palestinians.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The Arab-Israeli conflict,&#148; he said &#147;did not start
in 1967,&#148; adding that the UN Security Council resolutions regarding refugees ought to
be carried out, or else there would be no peace in the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For his part, the head of the Israeli delegation, Odid Eran, reiterated
the traditional Israeli position on the final status issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel, he said, would not revert to the 1967 borders; Jerusalem would
remain &#147;Israel&#146;s capital&#148;; and the refugees would have to be resettled in
host countries where they are now residing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both Eran and Abed Rabbou wrangled sharply but politely over the meaning
of resolutions 242 and 338.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abed Rabbou indicated that the resolutions were in effect the bedrock
foundation of the peace process, while Eran sought to either downplay or dilute their
relevance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak remarked that the two
resolutions did not apply to the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, arguing that the
resolutions applied only to occupied territory belonging to sovereign countries such as
Egypt and Syria.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement, later echoed by several Israeli officials and repeated by
Barak himself in Paris on 8 November, drew angry reactions from Palestinian leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser Abed Rabbou described the remarks as &#147;a grave distortion of
the very concept of the peace process.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The former Chief Palestinian negotiator, Sa&#146;eb Ureikat, said the
statements amounted to &#147;a grave and scandalous mendacity.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>If [resolutions] 242 and 338 do not apply to the West Bank,
then what is the reference for the peace process?&#148; asked Ureikat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even PA Chairman Yasser Arafat, known for his generally circumspect public
reactions to public statements by Israeli officials, felt provoked by Barak&#146;s
remarks.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>I want to remind Barak that when we sat down together at
Madrid (peace conference in 1991), we did so on the basis of United Nations resolutions
242 and 338 and the principle of land-for-peace,&#148; Arafat told journalists on 8
November in Paris where he was attending the Socialist Internationale conference. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For his part, Eran sought to re-present Barak&#146;s statements on the
applicability of 242 and 338 concerning the occupied Palestinian territories in a more
diplomatic and euphemistic manner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said Israel recognized that the two resolutions constituted the
ultimate terms of reference of the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, he added that &#147;it is no secret that the two sides hold
different interpretations of the meaning of the two resolutions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eran&#146;s statement was in fact a euphemistic reiteration of
Barak&#146;s set of &#147;NOs&#148;, which include no return to the 1967 borders,
Jerusalem remaining Israel&#146;s capital, and the bulk of settlements remaining under
Israeli sovereignty. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Talks unlikely to produce substantial results</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having illustrated the wide&#151;some say irreconcilable&#151;gaps in
their respective position, the two delegations agreed to meet again on Thursday, 11
November.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, given the enormous distance between their two respective stances
and Israel&#146;s recalcitrant refusal to meet the very minimum of Palestinian
expectations, much less aspirations, it seems unlikely that the talks will produce
substantial results under the current circumstances.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, observers believe, may eventually lead to the opening of an
alternative secret track involving Barak and Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, however, this kind of track is dreaded by most
Palestinians, who never recovered from the jolt of Oslo. However, it is amply clear that
Israel, in particular Mr. Barak and the Israeli intelligence community, prefer to have
secret talks with Yasser Arafat. </p>

<p>The rationale behind this strategy is that in secret talks, Arafat could be cajoled
into giving much more concessions in secret than in public. Indeed, the secret channel
seems already to have started somewhere in Europe, according to the London-based Saudi
daily, <i>al-Shark al-Awsat</i>. It is certain that more will be revealed in days and
weeks to come.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Redeployment: the saga continues</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The hand-over by Israel of 5% of the West Bank to
the Palestinian Authority, as stipulated in the revised Wye Memorandum agreement signed in
Sharm el-Sheikh two months ago, has been postponed pending the Palestinian
leadership&#146;s consent to the withdrawal maps. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, several rounds of high-level talks, including a previously
unannounced late-night meeting between Arafat and Barak in Tel Aviv on 14 November, along
with the so-called &#147;bridging efforts&#148; of U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, have failed to
get the process going. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA had hoped that Ross, who arrived in Israel on 15 November, would
convince Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to revise the maps in a way that would allow
for more Palestinian population centres to come under PA civilian control. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, far from convincing&#151;or even seeking to convince&#151;the
Israelis to revise the maps, Ross actually made remarks acquiescing to the Israeli
position. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That position, as stated several times by Foreign Minister David Levy,
dictates that &#147;Israel alone has the exclusive right to decide the location of land to
be transferred to the Palestinians.&#148; In other words, any Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank does not require Palestinian approval. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA rejected this interpretation, saying that the Israeli attitude
amounted to &#147;a take-it-or-leave-it offer rather than a bilateral agreement between
two sides.&#148; </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Show me one article signed since the declaration of
principles of Oslo and up until the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum which specifies that Israel
make these decisions unilaterally,&#148; protested Palestinian negotiator Sa&#146;eb
Ureikat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He further pointed out that while negotiating the Sharm el-Sheikh
agreement, the two sides had agreed that the maps would be subject to both parties&#146;
consideration, since &#147;otherwise, this would be dictation not negotiation.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian objection to the maps (which does not amount to a rejection)
is not unreasonable. Three per cent of the West Bank territory slated to become Area (B),
where the PA exercises civilian responsibilities while Israel maintains overall security
authority, has actually turned out to be barren desert land and largely unpopulated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likewise, the remaining 2% (of the 5% to be covered in the current
redeployment) earmarked to become Area (A), where the PA maintains civilian and security
responsibilities, also turned out to be isolated pockets of territory with little or no
integration into the autonomous enclaves. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Redeployment maps insulting to Palestinians</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli redeployment maps, which had earlier been endorsed by the
Knesset and the Israeli Cabinet, proved embarrassing for some Palestinian officials. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Legislative Council speaker Ahmed Qrei lambasted the maps as
&#147;an insult to our sense of dignity.&#148; </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Our people are not going to feel a change; what can we tell
them?&#148; he complained. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Palestinian commentator, quoted by the Israeli English daily, the <i>Jerusalem
Post</i>, on 14 November, spoke of Israel wanting the PA to safeguard the well-being of
snakes and scorpions, as the areas suggested for transfer to the PA are virtually
unpopulated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, Barak remained adamant in the face of Palestinian
protestations. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The maps have already been decided upon and have been
approved by both the Cabinet and the Knesset. The transfer of land will take place
according to them,&#148; Barak said with a whiff of insolence during a tour of the Negev
on 15 November. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, some Israeli government officials accused Arafat of deliberately
stalling the talks, calling his refusal to accept the redeployment maps as &#147;just
another ploy to get the U.S. more involved in the details of the talks.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This may well be true. Arafat, after all, views the United States as the
main (if not the sole) guarantor against the imposition by Israel of its will on the PA
under the rubric and in the context of &#147;direct, bilateral negotiations.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that while the current deadlock is
considered an interim-phase issue, its relevance to the final status talks is
unmistakable. The two sides, particularly the Israelis, seem to be quite keen about this
dimension. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Psychologically, Israel does not want to appear to back off in the face of
Palestinian objections, even though a step as such would be perfectly innocuous for
Israel, since the transfer of the bulk of the remaining Palestinian villages and hamlets
(now under Israeli control) to PA control would ostensibly strengthen, not weaken, the
Israeli bargaining position in the final status talks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, on many occasions, Israeli officials from both the Likud and Labor
parties have boasted that Israel was letting the Palestinians go free since up to 90% of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were ruled by the PA, not by Israel (the
claim is, of course, erroneous since the Israeli army continues to operate freely
throughout the West Bank and Gaza and control roads linking various Palestinian population
centres, including those under exclusive PA administration). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some observers believe the Israeli tactic is to get tough with Arafat on
the remaining unresolved interim issues (Ureikat says there are 34 of them) in order to
lower his expectations of the final status talks. In other words, Israel would like to
retain as many cards as possible from the interim phase in order to use them as bargaining
chips to extract concessions from the PA during the final status talks. Thus, the concept
of &#147;linkage&#148; (linking the implementation of the interim phase with the final
status talks), which had been proposed by Barak and rejected by the PA, would be realized,
de facto, at least. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the PA strategy is exactly the opposite and is focused on
gaining as much land as possible before hard negotiations on fundamental issues begin.
This strategy, however, does not seem to be working effectively, with only an estimated 5%
of the West Bank now under full PA administration and another 12% under joint PA-Israeli
control. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak&#146;s predecessor, Benyamin Netanyahu, had insisted that Israel
alone would decide the scope of Oslo&#146;s third and final phase of redeployment. This,
he said, would not exceed 1% of the West Bank, in contrast to the PA-declared position
that the said phase would cover the entirety of the West Bank minus East Jerusalem, the
settlements and Israeli army military positions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak&#146;s accommodating approach to the settlers, as exemplified in the
recent rendering of legitimacy to the bulk of settlements and settlement outposts erected
during Netanyahu&#146;s term of office, more than testifies that the differences between
him and his predecessor are over shape rather than substance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, in parallel to the interim-phase talks, Israel and the PA have
so far held five &#147;exploratory&#148; rounds of the so-called final status talks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The last of these rounds took place in Ramallah on 22 November, and the
Israeli representative, Odid Eran, who also heads the Israeli team to the interim-phase
talks (which suggests that Israel considers the final status talks a mere continuation of
the interim phase), presented the Israeli views on the final status issues. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA representative, Yasser Abed Rabbou, will present the Palestinian
views in the next round of talks, expected to take place during the last week of November.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to observers, while the two sides try to conduct the talks in a
businesslike atmosphere, especially in the presence of the media, it is clear from their
statements that they not only talk at cross purposes but think at cross purposes as well. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And given the fundamental differences between the two sides, it is
unlikely that the Eran-Abed Rabbou talks will culminate in a breakthrough in the
foreseeable future, if at all. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Hamas distances itself from bombing</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The pipe bomb blast in the Israeli town of
Netanya on 7 November, which slightly hurt around 20 people, continued to puzzle observers
as to the identity of the perpetrators. Indeed, not only has no Palestinian organization
taken credit for the attack, but some Palestinian officials, including Yasser Arafat,
suggested the incident might have been perpetrated by rival gangs of the Israeli-Russian
mafia.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Israeli political leaders and security officials immediately
pinned the blame for the attack on Hamas or the Islamic Jihad. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a strongly worded statement,
vowing to deal a knockout blow to terrorists. He argued that the bombing was aimed at
stalling the peace process, having been carried out on the eve of the resumption of the
final status talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah on 8 November.
He stressed that he did not intend to slow down the pace of the peace process because of
the incident.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Barak and other Israeli officials did call on the PA to &#147;act
effectively to prevent terrorists from harming the chances of progress in the peace
process.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Combating terror was a centerpiece of the Oslo Accords,&#148;
said Israeli deputy-defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, adding in an almost threatening tone
that the PA &#147;had better understand this.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, Israeli officials did not really chastise the PA for the
attack, and instead stressed that terrorism was the common enemy of Israel and the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, on the same day of the attack, Sneh admitted that 1999 was the
best year for Israeli-Palestinian security coordination since the establishment of the PA
in 1993. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He noted that the PA was interning hundreds of Palestinians without charge
or trial in deference to Israeli security interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, PA reactions to the incident were strong and quick. One PA
official, Al-Tayeb Abdul Rahim, described the blast as &#147;an act of terror which we
condemn without reservations.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He called on the Israeli security authorities to extend to their
Palestinian counterparts all relevant information about the perpetrators.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He accused &#147;elements within Hizbullah, Hamas, and the Islamic
Jihad,&#148; who he said were acting at Iran&#146;s beck and call to seek out a way to
sabotage the peace process and consequently &#147;impede the liberation of additional
parts of our homeland.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He alleged that three groups were, under Iranian tutelage, plotting to
launch a new spate of bombings for the purpose of aborting the final status talks, saying
the PA had &#147;solid information&#148; to that effect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, the charges leveled by Abdul Rahim don&#146;t seem to be
genuine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, Hamas and Islamic Jihad sources described the statement as an
&#147;hallucination&#148; and &#147;cheap misinformation designed to appease and please
the Zionists.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this month, the Israeli Hebrew press disclosed that this report
about a secret meeting of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hizbullah officials in Tehran, which
was first published in the Paris-based journal al-Watan Al-Arabi, actually originated in
the &#147;psychological warfare unit&#148; in the Israeli army and had actually been
completely concocted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from that, the PA has not rounded up suspects as it routinely does
in similar circumstances, perhaps because of certain suspicions that the incident was not
a &#147;convincing terrorist act&#148; as one Palestinian official put it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Arafat&#146;s statements in Paris that the incident &#147;was
likely an act of the Israeli mafia&#148; contradicted statements made by Al-Tayeb Abdul
Rahim, and underscored the lack of coordination in PA reactions to events in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin distanced his Movement from the Netanya
blast, saying Hamas was no longer targeting non-combatant civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin said he was sure that the military wing of Hamas, the Izzidin
al-Qassam Brigades, did not carry out the bombing, saying that &#147;our fighters do not
attack civilians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin reiterated Hamas&#146; decision, which he described as final, not
to attack civilians and non-combatants except when Palestinian civilians are targeted by
the Israeli occupation army. Hamas, he said, took a solemn decision to that effect, adding
that he challenged the Israeli occupation authorities to reciprocate.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We decided to take non-combatant civilians out of the
dictionary of the conflict,&#148; he said. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin&#146;s recurrent emphasis to that effect suggests that he
personally pushed for the decision, which was first announced in a leaflet circulated last
month and signed by Hamas&#146; military wing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The motive behind the decision, it seems, was both moral and political.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas, Yassin argued on several occasions, ought to return to its Islamic
purity which entails that it refrain from attacking women and children as, indeed,
commanded by Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Yassin discounted a leaflet also signed by the Izzidin al-Qassam
group vowing to resume attacks on Israeli targets in light of the unabated expansion of
Jewish settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Islamist sources said later that &#147;they could neither confirm
nor deny the authenticity of the leaflets since there is no direct contact between the
political and military wings of Hamas.&#148;</p>

Nazareth amid Christian objections</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Amid fierce Vatican opposition, Muslims in
Israel&#146;s largest Arab town, Nazareth, today laid the cornerstone for a large mosque a
few hundred yards opposite the Church of the Annunciation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mosque, to be called &#147;Masjid Shehabuddin&#148; (the Mosque of
Shehabuddin), is to be built on Muslim Waqf (Muslim trust) land located in the vicinity of
the historical Basilica.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Attending the ceremony were Muslim leaders from the one-million strong
Arab community in Israel, including Knesset members, religious figures and a multitude of
ordinary citizens from Nazareth and surrounding Arab communities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the mayor of Nazareth, Ramez Jarayseh, as well as Christian
religious and political leaders chose to stay away to show their displeasure at the
Israeli decision to build the mosque in the vicinity of the Church.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jarayseh, a Christian communist, has relentlessly sought to prevent the
building of the mosque, arguing that the land in question belonged to the Municipal
Council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Jarayseh&#146;s arch political rival, Salman Abu Ahmed, disputed
this, arguing that Muslims produced authentic and irrefutable evidence supporting their
claim that the land was Muslim Waqf land dating back to the Muslim hero Saladin over eight
centuries ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Ahmed, head of the United Nazareth List, which championed the cause of
the mosque, criticized Christian objections and sensitivity to the building of a mosque.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>This (the mosque) is a house of God and that (the Church) is
a house of God, and there is no reason in the world that two houses of God cannot stand
side by side.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Ahmed argued that the establishment of the mosque on Waqf land near
the Church should be a cause for unity not division between Muslims and Christians not
only in Nazareth but also in the whole of Palestine.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Churches and mosques stood in the past, stand today, and will
continue to stand side by side&#133;this should be a cause for harmony and brotherhood not
disharmony and discord.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He denied that Muslims in Nazareth had come under pressure to delay or
cancel the cornerstone-laying.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>No pressure was put on us. Some remarks were made because it
was thought that there was tension in Nazareth, even though this is not the case and I can
reassure everybody about this,&#148; he said, adding that &#147;all the residents of
Nazareth accepted the decision of the seven-member forum of the Arab leadership&#146;s
Monitoring Committee and the Ministerial Committee.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Islamic leaders in Nazareth and the rest of Palestine said they had
rejected calls by the Palestinian Authority to defer the ceremony because the intention of
the PA was apparently to ultimately bring about the cancellation of the mosque&#146;s
construction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Muslim leader in Nazareth marveled at the controversy surrounding
the mosque.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We are building a mosque here, not a casino or a theatre or a
place of corruption,&#148; said Ahmed al-Zu&#146;abi, head of the Waqf in Nazareth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Zu&#146;abi rebuffed a call from Yasser Arafat to postpone the
building of the mosque.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Arafat has no right to tell us what to do; let him first
liberate Al-Aqsa Mosque.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Christian leaders protest</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Protesting the building of the mosque, Christian leaders in Israel and the
PA autonomous enclaves decided to close their churches in the face of tourists and
pilgrimage for two days, 23 and 24 November.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, head of the Roman Catholic Church in the
Holy Land, pointed out that the closure of the churches for two days came to symbolize
Christian displeasure and dissatisfaction over a whole host of issues.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We were obliged to close our churches to make our voice
heard.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Roman Catholic leader, Elias Odeh, of the Church of the
Annunciation itself, also voiced the same vague grievances. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The feeling of Christians is that there is no future. There
is no security, and there is no law.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The decision to build the mosque has angered the Vatican and cast a cloud
over prospects for a pilgrimage by Pope John Paul to Nazareth in March.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 November, the Vatican said that by allowing the building of a mosque
on a disputed site near the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth, the government is
fomenting tension between Christians and Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The denunciation came in the form of a statement by Joaquin Navarro-Valls,
director of the Vatican Press Office.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>I believe the political authorities in this case have a great
responsibility, because instead of favouring unity, they create the foundation to foment
division,&#148; said Navarro-Valls.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Vatican charges were strongly denied by Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy described the charges as
&#147;dangerous&#148;, saying the decision to build the mosque was a compromise accepted
by all parties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear what prompted Christians to oppose the building of the
mosque in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Local sources in Nazareth opined that Christian leaders were worried that
the presence of an Islamic edifice next to a Church would undoubtedly undermine the
latter&#146;s dominating presence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Muslim source in Nazareth, who asked for anonymity, said he believed
the real reason was Christian worries that the mosque would attract some of the lustre of
the Basilica and might serve as &#147;a propagation centre&#148; for the Islamic faith in
an area which many Christians consider a Christian bastion.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>They want Nazareth to be exclusively theirs just as Mecca and
Medina are exclusively Islamic,&#148; said the local Muslim source. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- The Israeli interior minister, Natan Sharansky,
said he would order an end to the policy of confiscating residency rights from
Palestinians in East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an interview with the Jerusalem-based daily, al Quds, Sharansky said
the new policy would go into effect very soon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Palestinian sources in Jerusalem discounted Sharansky&#146;s
remarks, describing them as &#147;for domestic consumption.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We want action, not words,&#148; said an Arab source.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, Israel withdrew residency rights from as many as 20,000 East
Jerusalem Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Israeli policy had a boomerang effect in the form of a flood
of Palestinians returning to Jerusalem, which may have prompted the Israeli government to
reconsider the policy of withdrawing residency rights from Arabs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, an Israeli writer revealed that the Israeli successive
governments adopted a racist policy toward Palestinians in East Jerusalem aimed at
curtailing Arab demographic growth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his book published last month, Emir Hechen, a former secretary of
Jerusalem municipal council for ten years, said that all Israeli governments adopted a
policy towards Arabs in the Eastern part of town whereby Arabs wouldn&#146;t exceed 20% of
the over all population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hechen said several tactics were employed, including home demolition,
refusal to grant Arabs building licenses, confiscation of residency rights from East
Jerusalem&#146;s Arabs and encouraging Arabs to leave the town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hechen describes the enduring policy as &#147;bluntly racist&#148; but
&#147;politically expedient.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel still practices ethnic cleansing against Palestinians in East
Jerusalem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas and the Islamic Jihad received 8 seats of the 31-seat student
general assembly during the student election, which took on 24 November.</p>

seats while the leftist coalition of the Democratic and Popular fronts for the liberation
of Palestine received 10 seats.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This means that neither Fatah nor the left would be able to form the
student council alone without entering into a coalition with the Islamic block.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Over sixty per cent of the student body at the Catholic university are
