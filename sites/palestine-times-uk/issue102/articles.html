from Jordan</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron- From Khalid Amayreh</b><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, reacted angrily to the deportation
from Jordan on 20 November of four of its Amman-based leaders to Qatar, describing the
Jordanian measure as &#147;harsh and provocative.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin termed as
&#147;illogical and abnormal&#148; the &#147;deportation by a government of its own
citizens,&#148; adding that the deportation flagrantly contravened the Jordanian
constitution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas&#146; Information Office in Gaza released a written statement to the
press, denouncing &#147;the hostile and unprecedented act against Jordanian citizens by a
Jordanian government.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement drew an analogy between the draconian Jordanian measure
against the four Islamist leaders (Khalid Masha&#146;al, chief of Hamas political bureau;
Ibrahim Ghousheh, Hamas official spokesman; and Ezzat Rasheq and Sami Khater members of
the political bureau) and the deportation of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza by
the Israeli occupation authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This vile act reminds us of the notorious actions of the Israeli
occupation authorities, only this time the deportation and expulsion is committed by an
Arab government.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ismael Haniyya, a close confidant of Yassin, accused the Jordanian
government of acting on Israel&#146;s behalf. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is certainly not a sovereign Jordanian decision; no sovereign
State resorts to deporting its own citizens to appease another country.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deportation of the four Islamists drew indignant reactions from
Palestinian Islamists, intellectuals and human rights activists, as well as from ordinary
citizens.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a reflection of the dire state of affairs the Arab world has
reached&#133;what more can one say about a government deporting its own citizens in order
to please a foreign country,&#148; said one Islamist leader in the Ramallah area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nayef Rajoub of the Grand Mosque in Dura said the harsh measure against
the four Islamists was solely aimed at appeasing Israel and the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There is only one explanation of what happened, and that is the
government of Jordan is not answerable to its own people but to some other entities which
we know all too well.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Qatar itself, Khalid Misha&#146;al dismissed the Jordanian description
of the deportation as &#147;only a temporary transfer&#148; as &#147;rubbish coming out of
a rubbish mentality.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What would you call blindfolding an innocent citizen, handcuffing
him, forcing him into an airplane, and sending him to a foreign country?&#148; retorted
Misha&#146;al.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He described the manner in which the deportation was carried out as
&#147;vindictive, humiliating and full of malice.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Qatari sympathizer remarked on the mistreatment of the four Islamists
at the hands of the Jordanian Interior Ministry officials saying, &#147;I&#146;m sure if
they were Jews from Tel Aviv, they would not have been treated as such.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the PA refused to comment on events in Amman, saying in a
terse statement carried by the PA news agency, <i>Wafa</i>, that &#147;what happened was
an internal Jordanian affair&#148; and that &#147;we don&#146;t interfere in the internal
affairs of a brotherly country.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was widely believed that the Jordanian crackdown on Hamas was carried
out, at least in part, under incessant pressure from the PA, which repeatedly accused
Hamas external leadership of directing acts of violence against Israel for the purpose of
corroding the peace process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the PA Minister of Communications, Imad al-Faluji, called on
Hamas leaders to transfer its politburo into Gaza &#147;under the umbrella of the
Palestinian (National) Authority.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked if PA Chairman Yasser Arafat would welcome a step as such,
Faluji answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same offer was made later by PA Preventive Security Chief Jebril
Rajoub, who said in an interview with the Israeli English daily, the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>,
on 24 November that the PA was willing to offer Hamas &#147;sanctuary&#148;, provided that
the Islamist movement accept PA rule and renounce violence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is unlikely that Hamas would heed Faluji&#146;s and Rajoub&#146;s
advises, since putting all its eggs in the Gaza basket would place the movement at the
mercy of Yasser Arafat&#146;s security agencies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority, PA sources intimated, had been instrumental in
pressuring Jordan to expel the four Islamist leaders from Amman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA Chairman Arafat traveled to Jordan on 24 November and reportedly
thanked Jordanian officials, including Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, for deporting
the Islamist leaders to Qatar.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Arafat parroted Jordanian claims that what happened was not
&#147;deportation&#148; but &#147;forced travel&#148; aimed at resolving a crisis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The decision was made to end the crisis; it wasn&#146;t a
deportation,&#148; said Arafat in statements carried by news agencies on 24 November.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Amman, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Action front,
Jordan&#146;s largest political party, denounced the expulsions and warned that they will
exacerbate the crisis between the Islamists and the Jordanian government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a statement released by the Islamic Action Front on 23 November, the
Islamists accused the government of moving against Hamas in a response to U.S. and Zionist
demands imposed on Jordan at a phase when the Palestinian cause is facing liquidation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, it expected that a group of Jordanian lawyers would challenge
the government decision before the highest Jordanian court. Saleh al-Armouti, who
represents the four Islamic leaders, contented that the decision to deport his clients was
&#147;unconstitutional 100%.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There is a clear clause in the Jordanian constitution outlawing the
deportation of Jordanian citizens from their own country,&#148; said Armouti.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The government committed a manifest criminal act,&#148; he added. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Everybody Knows the Good Guys Lost</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Ruth Anderson</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Everybody knows the good guys lost. Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
Everybody knows the deal is rotten. Everybody knows the plague is coming and it is moving
fast.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My first name is Khaled. I have no weapons to fight with except my belief
in God and my commitment to liberating the country of my origin, Palestine. Yet, people
fear me. Perhaps this is because they fear the truth and they fear those who would
sacrifice their lives for what they believe in.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I have been jailed for what I believe in. I was almost killed for what I
believe in. And now, I am a deportee. Those of us who were deported were handcuffed and
blindfolded. This is unheard of. Yet, I will not give up until death takes me. The
organization I belong to is Hamas. In 1993, Hamas was legalized in Jordan by the
government. It has never been illegal nor has it ever done anything against the Jordanian
government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I realize that it is because of pressure from the Israelis, the
Palestinian Authority and Washington that the Jordanian government was coerced into
expelling me and some of my compatriots. These various forces want to ensure that the
peace process, no matter how much it further depletes the remnants of Palestine, be
safeguarded.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am not against peace. I am neither a warlord nor a warmonger. I have
nothing to gain from war. I wish no one harm, but at the same time, I cannot bear to see
what is left of Palestine bargained off by those who usurped it in the first place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What bothers me, too, is that I am a Jordanian citizen. How, then, can I
be deported from the country that gave me citizenship in the first place? Surely no
country in the world deports its citizens for peacefully practicing what they believe in.
I do not threaten the security of the Jordanian government nor the security of any other
government. And, I have every right to be concerned about the bargaining off of the land
of my forefathers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My deportation has serious implications to the millions of Palestinians
who were given Jordanian citizenship. More than 70% of Jordan is made up of Palestinians.
If my fellow sufferers and I can be expelled, then Jordan cannot really be considered home
to the rest of the Palestinian population who hold Jordanian passports. Imagine what a
crisis it would be to the stability of the government if all the Palestinians just up and
left Jordan. There would be very few people remaining, leaving Amman a virtual ghost town.
A true and just peace must ensure that all are entitled to equal social and political
rights, human dignity and to live on their land without fear of harm. True peace would
guarantee that little Palestinian children are free to play in front of their homes
without fear of being struck and/or killed by Israeli &#147;stray&#148; bullets. True
peace would mean an end to the &#147;Double Occupation&#148; that plagues all Palestinians
who still live in Palestine. True peace would also mean that PA jails that contain Hamas
members be emptied.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But then, everybody knows the good guys lost. Everybody knows the fight
was fixed. My fellow expellees and I are heroes in the seaweed. And remember, history is
written by those who hang heroes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Everybody knows the deal is rotten. Everybody knows the plague is coming
and it is moving fast.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The pretext given for my leaving Jordan by the Jordanian government is
that I and my companions were not being deported, but rather we were having our sentences
suspended by traveling to Qatar. At this time, I do not know what will happen to me and my
fellow deportees. We have been separated from our homes and the ones we love. Some of us
have been badly beaten, and all of us have undergone &#147;convincing&#148; words to
&#147;encourage&#148; us to change our minds about our commitment to what we believe in.
So what if a little bit more of Palestine is sold every day? So what if Palestinian
children die in the streets in their occupied land, simply because they are Palestinians?
So what if the streets of Palestine are covered with the blood of martyrs who died for
liberty and freedom? And so what if more and more Jewish settlements are being built on
what is left of Palestinian land? It&#146;s no big deal anyway. No big deal to anyone but
those Palestinians who cherish liberty and love their homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Dear Secretary-General:</font></b></p>
<b>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">RE: <u>The unfinished business of the refugees</u></font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you prepare to lead the United Nations into the twenty-first
century, one issue must, inevitably, remain at the top of your agenda. It is the question
of Palestine and the final restoration of its people&#146;s human rights. This is
perfectly understandable as no other international issue has engaged as much time and
resources of your Organization. Because it remains largely an unresolved problem, we are
obliged to proffer some approaches for your wise consideration. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may recall that this December marks the fifty-first anniversary of
General Assembly resolution 194, which calls for the return of the Palestinian refugees to
their homes. It is, likewise, the twenty-ninth anniversary of resolution 2535 B (XXIV),
which recognizes &#147;that the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees has arisen from
the denial of their inalienable rights under the Charter of the United Nations and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&#148; Israel&#146;s continued refusal to comply
with these international rulings must naturally be a source of grave concern and unease
for you. The failure of UN appeals, censures, resolutions and condemnations to alter the
policies of the Jewish State means that 5 million Palestinians will, regretfully, enter
the new millennium facing the threat of permanent exile, primarily because they are Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From your favoured position as head of the UN, we believe that you are
uniquely placed, perhaps better than any other world leader, to appreciate the magnitude
of the Palestine problem and the depth of its people&#146;s sentiments toward your
Organization. Their demands are firmly rooted in the same principles of &#147;justice and
international law&#148; that are enshrined in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter.
Like all the other peoples who were detached from the Ottoman Empire in 1917, the
Palestinians were recognized as an &#147;independent nation&#148; by Article 22 of the
Covenant of the League of Nations. Although they were never divested of sovereignty over
their land in the period leading up to 1947, the UN took advantage of their weakness and
granted 57% of their land to a Jewish immigrant minority that constituted no more than 32%
of the population. The failure of all subsequent peace efforts to resolve the Palestine
problem was essentially owing to the non-recognition of this initial abuse of power and
excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With key world figures now endeavouring to modernize their States in
order to meet the challenges of the next century, you could not have found a more
auspicious occasion than the year 2000 to restore credibility, confidence and hope in the
UN. The failure of more than 600 Security Council and General Assembly resolutions (now
compiled into four volumes by the Institute of Palestine Studies) to secure their
inalienable rights has left the vast majority of Palestinians embittered and
disillusioned. Under the circumstances, the UN must, sooner rather than later, make one of
two choices: (a) It can, on the one hand, be a willing accomplice to the imposition of a
&#147;Pax Hebraica&#148; upon the Palestinian people in the the year 2000 in which they
receive less than 20% of their ancestral land, while two thirds of their kith and kin
remain permanent exiles, or (b) alternatively, it can scrupulously translate into reality
the ideal outlined in its Charter &#147;to develop friendly relations among nations based
on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.&#148;
Whichever it chooses, the question of Palestine will, by virtue of its sheer longevity and
complexity, almost certainly be the litmus test of the UN&#146;s success or failure. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are means of enforcement </b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assuredly, any meaningful attempt on your part to ensure Israeli
compliance with UN resolutions would result in a veritable diplomatic war with the powers
that be in Washington. Thanks to the efforts of Henry Kissinger, they have, since 1975,
placed their UN vote entirely at the disposal of Israel in accord with the Memorandum of
Agreement which he arranged between the United States Government and Israel in connection
with the Egyptian-Israeli Agreement of 1 September 1975. Article 8 of that Memorandum
reads: &#147;The United States Government will vote against any Security Council
resolution which in its judgement affects or alters adversely the Agreement.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That being their stated intent, every successive American
administration has, in practice, voted against UN resolutions which sought to end
Israel&#146;s status as the belligerent occupier of territories it acquired by force. The
UN&#146;s complete resignation to this situation has, naturally, sent the wrong signals to
millions of dispossessed and disenfranchised people around the world. They have concluded
that there are no clauses or mechanisms in the UN Charter that enable it to enforce its
decisions. And, that the General Assembly is powerless to act when a member or members of
the Security Council abuse their power and jeopardize world peace. Though largely
excusable, we believe this perception is fundamentally wrong. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to the impression conveyed by Washington that it has been
endowed with absolute rights and privileges within the UN, there are certain principles
that can prevent this unilateral subversion of the UN. Here again we refer to the
Charter&#146;s Article 1, which states that the purpose of the UN is to &#147;take
collective measures&#148; for the prevention and removal of threats to peace and the
suppression of acts of aggression. This principle, you would recall, was eminently
effected in the famous &#147;Uniting for Peace&#148; resolution (377 A (V) of 3 November
1950. &#147;That if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent
members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security&#133;.the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a
view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures, including
in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force, when
necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secretary General, in the light of the above, you would agree that
there are no &#147;indispensable&#148; members of United Nations, as some would like us to
believe. Yet, with regard to the Palestinian Arab refugees, &#147;the enjoyment of their
right to return to their homes and property &#133; <i>is</i> <i>indispensable</i> for the
achievement of a just settlement of the refugee problem&#133;&#148; (resolution 3089 D, 7
December 1973). Without attempting to predetermine your response to this letter we,
somehow, assume that because of your many years within the Organization, you would soon
come to the same conclusion as Dr. John H. Davis, the former Commissioner General of the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). That &#147;in the end, one must even be
prepared to impose corrective measures on Israel against her will.&#148;<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Israel&#146;s continued violation of international law is not just a
manifestation of its militaristic ambitions. It is also the reflection of an outdated
doctrine that seeks to accrue to itself privilege, favour and exclusivity. Thus, as long
as its policies are guided by such beliefs, the threat and actual use of UN force must
become unavoidable and necessary. Surely, if nothing else was learned from the past 51
years, it is the fact that the Jewish State has never relinquished Arab land or restored
any of their usurped rights except after being confronted with force. Backed by the
British and French veto of resolution 999, it refused in 1956 to relinquish Egyptian
territory. Then, it was only after the General Assembly established the United Nations
Emergency Force (UNEF) to impose its will did the Jewish State comply.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking care of business</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is the common tendency today among government officials and
international civil servants, you may also ask whether or not the UN is able to now turn
back the clock of time 51 years to ensure the implementation of resolution 194? The answer
is yes. It can and must; just as it turned back the clock 3,000 years in 1947 to create a
Jewish State in Palestine. In many respects the UN is equally culpable as the Zionists for
creating the refugee problem. This was accomplished by its execution of three fateful
decisions, all prejudiced against Palestinian national rights and aspirations. The first
step was the partition and exodus that it provoked. The second was not to include the
Palestinians under the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) but instead create for them an enfeebled and powerless UNRWA. And thirdly, the
decision taken in 1951 to exclude the refugees assisted by UNRWA from the 1951 Convention
Relating to the Status of Refugees, thereby denying them the special protection provided
for in the Convention as well as the international protection given by UNHCR. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Admittedly, our letter would be incomplete if it failed to register a
note of concern about the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP).
Appointed in 1948 by the Assembly under resolution 194, the record of this august body
consisting of France, the United States and Turkey has been typically one of neglect and
unfinished business. Charged with the responsibility to facilitate the repatriation,
resettlement and economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees and the payment of
compensation, the Commission, it appears, has long ran out of what it takes to discharge
its obligations. We, therefore, note with bemusement that while it has not undertaken any
significant initiative to resolve the refugee problem since 1964, the General Assembly
never formally abolished the Conciliation Commission. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the UN should, wittingly or unwittingly, allow the abuse of its
good offices to undermine international law, prolong human suffering and threaten world
peace is totally inexcusable. Surely, time has changed. Whereas yesterday&#146;s leaders
claimed that that there is no place for morality in international politics, today&#146;s
men have recognized the need for an ethical dimension in international relations. For this
reason, and many more, we shall remain optimistic about the future, hoping that we would
not have to wait much longer before men of true honour and courage would arise to defend
the law both in letter and spirit. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, Israel&#146;s aim to impose permanent exile on the
Palestinian refugees is the surest way to prevent their exercise of sovereignty over their
land. Nothing on the horizon suggests that their ultimate return would be realized under
your stewardship. While history would be oft-forgiving of those who tried and failed, it
surely would neither forgive nor forget those who had the means and did not try. It would,
moreover, never accept their claims that time and the prevalence of Israeli occupation
were too overwhelming. For in the same manner that the prolonged occupation of Poland from
1795 to 1919 did not annul the rights of its people to national independence, sovereignty
and return, so too the Palestinians expect the full restoration of their inalienable
rights, no matter how long the Israeli occupation. </p>

Terminology</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Ramzy Baroud</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A suicide mission in the heart of Jerusalem conducted by a young
Palestinian man is defined as an act of terrorism. The almost daily Israeli bombardments
of South Lebanon are seen as justifiable Israeli acts of retaliation to combat terrorism.
Why?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, such a question is no longer lingering in the Arab media
and mind as it once was and should have remained. In fact, in order for many Arabs to
distance themselves from any act that can be described by Israel and the United States as
&#147;terrorism&#148;, they appear more furious and hostile to this &#147;violent&#148;
approach than Israel itself does. In the meantime, Israel nowadays is hardly held
accountable for its part in the ceaseless violence as if its repetition has become a daily
ritual which the residents of South Lebanon depend on for a good night&#146;s sleep.
It&#146;s absurd, odd and maddening. I personally hold no expectation on the United States
for its unfair and bias stand, which hardly fails to side with Israel. The United
States&#146; close relations to the Middle East are motivated by two factors: its support
of Israel and its need for the region&#146;s abundant resources. Therefore, blaming the
U.S. based on morality is merely a waste of time. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The real worrisome notion is the fact that Israel&#146;s mental
manipulation is driving many Arabs and Muslims to see the world through Israel&#146;s
eyes. While many are engaged in a never-ending debate over whether suicide bombings are
morally permissible or not, Israel&#146;s terrorism is overlooked and no longer confronted
as the real source of violence. Israel is lucky enough to have its influence in the
Western media, which cleverly conceals its faults. The terrorist bombardment of civilians
in South Lebanon is therefore an act of retaliation; real bullets become rubber bullets;
the killing of unarmed Palestinians becomes an act of self-defense; even the direct
genocide of Palestinian civilians by an Israeli Jewish terrorist, according to twisted
Israeli definitions, becomes an unfortunate act committed by a mentally disabled person. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The violent behaviour of a Palestinian who was born Stateless, poor, and
oppressed physically and mentally originates from an entirely different circumstance than
an Israeli Jew who spent some or most of his life in Brooklyn, Moscow or elsewhere. Even
if the question narrows down to rejecting terrorism in all of its forms and mechanisms,
regardless of its origin and motivations, shouldn&#146;t the term terrorism be associated
with both Israelis and Palestinians? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s terrorism is of a much larger magnitude than terrorism
promoted by a small group of individuals, for Israel&#146;s terrorism is the result of a
State-approved agenda. In fact, Israeli terrorism is dealt with openly during campaign
elections and public debates, although they refer to it by different names. When an
Israeli candidate promotes himself in order to gather support among voters, he promises to
crack down on Lebanese terrorists (translation: &#147;I promise to randomly bombard South
Lebanon&#148;). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is indeed frightening to know that Israel&#146;s terminology is finally
doing its magic. When the radio declares that three Lebanese civilians were killed and
eight were injured in an Israeli air raid, no one expects that such killings will affect
the continuation of the peace process or Israel&#146;s image around the world. If the same
killings accrued following a suicide bombing attack&#151;while they in fact resemble a
desperate cry for help&#151;most of us hold our breath, waiting for an Israeli reaction.
Intelligent political analysis and commentary fills the newspapers on whether such a
&#147;hideous act&#148; will jeopardize the peace process. And when Israeli leaders
declare their willingness to resume the peace process regardless of terrorism, the world
stands, bows and applauds the courageous Israeli leaders for their warm hearts and their
endurance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Does anyone know Suad Fouan, a Lebanese woman from al-Houlah village in
occupied South Lebanon? Suad was wounded after an Israeli missile fell on her house in
early November. The Israeli missile also injured seven of Suad&#146;s neighbours.
Thousands were not as lucky as Suad and her neighbours; they died after hi-tech Israeli
weapons bombarded their humble homes in the dark. And the world refuses to see or
acknowledge such cruelty, inhumanity and blatant terrorism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Pleasing the United States by defaming Arab terrorism is consequently
affecting our ability to point at Israel&#146;s ongoing campaign of terror in South
Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories. It&#146;s important to remind ourselves
of who is the cause of ongoing Middle East violence. If we overlook such a fact,
Israel&#146;s deceptive definition of the term &#147;terrorism&#148; will make the Israeli
account the only side of the coin that the world shall ever see. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaza City -</b> There is in Gaza a dozen representative offices&#151;in
case of a rosy future they will be called embassies&#151;and three cultural centres. After
working in Algeria and Kuwait, Georges Bertrand headed since 15 August 1995 the French
Cultural Centre (FCC) of Gaza, which was established in 1989 and inaugurated in 1994.
Located in Er-Rimal, the most elegant borough of the capital of the Strip, on Victor Hugo
Street, the Centre stands amidst a green and bloom-ridden garden complete with cypress,
flame and palm trees, a sleeping cat and a hibiscus, like the one imagined in a book of
tales a long time ago. Under a roof of palm branches are the kiosk and five tables
belonging to the cafeteria. Georges Bertrand&#146;s mission in Gaza ended in July 1999,
and he gave us the following interview before his departure.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;In Gaza, everything is different. My post is very tiring because
I&#146;m in charge of several duties. I&#146;m the director of the Centre and at the same
time I represent the consul-general. For instance, tonight there is a reception and the
consul is busy in Jerusalem, so he asked me to go. I represent the consulate to the
organizations here, Palestinian as well as international. And as soon as there are some
problems, the people come and look for me&#151;problems with a bank, problems with a
prisoner. I&#146;m a little bit like an ambassador and I&#146;m invited to everything
which is French or Francophile. I represent France, this is sure. For the people, I
represent France because I&#146;m always on the spot.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;According to the Oslo accords, the flag should be at least 8
metres from the entrance in order not to be seen from the street because we are not an
official diplomatic representation. Therefore, it&#146;s prohibited to raise the flag at
the entrance. It&#146;s the same rule for all the representative offices, but the Chinese
have put their flag on the roof and lit it up with floodlights...</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;I work ten hours a day. I also work during the night at home; I
prepare everything on the computer for the day after. I work every day, only Friday is a
holiday. I work around 70 hours a week but I don&#146;t complain; I&#146;m not obliged to
do this. My fatigue gives me something: I see results. It&#146;s not like working in an
office in Jerusalem; here I can see the fruits of my hard work. We want to be a real
cultural centre with plenty of activities, to do many things for the population and this
means, naturally, a lot of work. In addition, we are not a centre like the others because
at the same time we also have a consular antenna.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;On top of that, it&#146;s a very difficult post because of the
Erez border crossing. To organize anything in Gaza is very complicated because everything
has to come from the other side. For a concert, we need a piano and we have to rent it and
to bring it here. Everything we do is tiring, but of course it&#146;s very enriching from
a human point of view in the sense that this centre was vegetating four years ago,
practically nobody was coming, and today it is one of the most active centres in the
Palestinian territories. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;In Gaza, there are the British Council and the German Centre,
which is an antenna of the Goëthe Institut of Tel Aviv. They hold one cultural activity
per year and that&#146;s all. They open for a few hours a day. We are open from morning
till evening for the courses as well as for the cultural activities. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;I spent almost one year asking for the consular antenna and I got
it. The first year I was here, I asked for it because most of the local population cannot
leave the Strip; consequently, the only way for them to ask for a visa was through the
FCC. On the other hand, Gaza is the headquarters of the executive branch of the
Palestinian Authority; there are many organizations and Arafat lives here. Plenty of
people need visas in order to accompany him or for other reasons and all the requests are
made here. Thanks to the Schengen Convention, when they get a French visa, they can travel
to several European countries. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;In June 1996, the consular antenna was established. Everything is
exceptional here, everything is exceptional in Gaza and in this region. It&#146;s the sole
FCC in the world with this kind of duty, and, of the three cultural centres in Gaza, we
are the only one which functions in this way. For the Goëthe Institut, there is a guy who
comes from Tel Aviv every week; he comes to bring the visas and returns. Instead, in our
centre, we have someone who is paid and works every day on the spot, except on Sunday. But
the decisions for giving the visas are taken in Jerusalem because it cannot be the task of
a local. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Suppose a Palestinian wants to go to Italy; there are some travel
agencies that can help him to obtain the visa in Jerusalem, but it&#146;s very expensive.
These agencies have people in Jerusalem with the applications. One comes here, makes him
fill in the applications and returns back with the dollars.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;We have two kinds of activities in the centre: linguistic and
cultural. We give courses to children and adults and the children are numerous. We have
courses at all levels, seven levels, in addition to courses of translation and
conversation. And we are obliged to refuse people. We also give courses by contract with
ministries and organizations outside the Centre. And we train teachers at the Faculty of
Education in coordination with a French university. We also teach Arabic to foreigners.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;We have a library and the &#147;Cine Club&#148; once every
week&#151;the only cinema in Gaza. We organize concerts, and we have a theatrical company.
And now I would like to speak about the cafeteria. Our Centre has become too small, the
premises are not large enough now and more and more people are coming. So we opened a
cafeteria in April 1997 in the garden. At first, only the males were going to the
cafeteria and the females stayed far away. At a later time, the females went to the
cafeteria but did not sit at the same tables with the males. Now you can see all the
people sitting together. There was fear at the beginning. A woman said to me, &#145;At
least now I can sit with a youth and laugh with him without the people saying, She&#146;s
unfaithful to her husband.&#146; I&#146;m very happy for this. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;It should be clear that the cafeteria is not a place for romantic
rendezvous. It&#146;s a place where people of both sexes mix as well as people of all
nationalities. For me, this is very important. I don&#146;t want a cafeteria where all the
Arabs sit together at the same table and all the expatriates at another one. It&#146;s a
place for exchange at all levels. Even the consul-general, delegations, come to the
cafeteria when they have appointments in Gaza and some spare time. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;The weather is usually hot here and it does not rain too much,
therefore we thought: why not the cafeteria in the garden? But we did not want it to be
seen from the street; we wanted to create a place a little bit secret, intimate. So the
people will feel comfortable. It represents for us an additional room, secret, it&#146;s a
cafeteria and a meeting room at the same time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;One of the most extraordinary events we ever organized [on 2
March 1998] was the recital of Sapho [a Jewish-born Moroccan singer]. It was really
extraordinary. The problem was that all her material was blocked at Erez with her
musicians. A ton and a half of material... Everything was blocked at Erez, including our
cooperators. We had rented the materials in Israel. It took six hours of negotiations
between the Palestinian, Israeli and French sides in order to get things moving again and
eventually Sapho sang in Gaza. An extraordinary success. There were Madame Arafat, whole
ministries, masses of people in attendance. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;The most terrible time during these four years was during the
famous clashes of 26 September 1996 [following the opening of an archaeological tunnel by
the Israelis for tourists in the Old City of Jerusalem that claimed the lives of 60
Palestinians and 15 Israelis all in the Occupied Territories]. That day was a Thursday. At
that time, France decided to donate urgent humanitarian aid. France, and also Italy, sent
it by airplane to Cairo, and when the humanitarian aid reached the Rafah border crossing,
the Israelis prevented its entrance into the Strip; it could not pass urgently. Therefore,
the medical aid had to be sent back to Cairo and from there to Tel Aviv and then to
Jerusalem. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;We were waiting in Gaza. What happened is that the Israelis at
Erez authorized CNN crews to enter the Strip but not the humanitarian aid. The only way to
pass was with consular vehicles with CC number-plates. I went to Jerusalem on Sunday, 29
September. All the staff of the Consulate packed the medical aid in cardboard boxes and
they were loaded into vehicles. We drove in a convoy as far as the Strip. All the consular
cars had been requisitioned, together with UN cars, UN trucks and UNRWA vehicles.
Eventually, we reached Esh-Shifa hospital [in Gaza City] with all the aid and the Minister
of Health, Riyad Ez-Zanoun, was waiting for us and he congratulated France for its deed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;At the same time, I had to take care of around 40 French
nationals who were in Gaza: cooperators, teachers, NGO staff and some French women married
to Palestinians. The other two cultural centres had closed their doors. We stayed open on
Thursday and Friday [while bloody clashes were still going on]. But after 15 days, I
collapsed a little bit, and then I completely collapsed 15 days later. It was the first
time in my life I had seen something like that: a sort of massacre within arm&#146;s
reach. I had never seen that... </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;The following month, during the visit of President Jacques
Chirac, the Israelis cut off all the mobile telephones. We couldn&#146;t communicate with
each other for two or three hours, the time of Chirac&#146;s visit in Gaza, the time to
disrupt everything...</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Another event I would like to mention took place on Friday, 13
October 1995, with the coming of 800 [French] pilgrims to Gaza accompanied by Abbot Pierre
and Bernard Kouchner, the then-French Minister of Health. The tour was organized by a
travel agency in Jerusalem, and we organized the part in Gaza, which lasted for one day.
They came in 18 buses from Jerusalem which stopped at the Erez checkpoint and on the
Palestinian side, other buses were waiting for them with 18 French-speaking Palestinians,
one in every bus, to accompany the pilgrims, Abbot Pierre and Kouchner. And we met Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;On Saturday, 11 July 1998, the twinning of Gaza with the city of
Dunkerque was celebrated, and the mayor himself came because Dunkerque was building the
first municipal library in Gaza. A beautiful library, near Yarmouk, on El-Wahda Street.
The first municipal library. There has been no library in Gaza before. At that time,
Morocco had already offered 4,000 books.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Gaza is a very small place and it&#146;s closed in. In France,
one can get out from the small villages, here you cannot. Because of the closure, of
course, particular relations are established between the people, between the foreigners
living here as well as between the foreigners and the Palestinians. In fact, there is a
double confinement: one due to the Israeli policy [of blockade], the other one because of
the Palestinian policy for security. So the people feel doubly confined as well as being
watched. On top of that, there is a third confinement due to the traditions. Here you have
a military, political and social confinement and consequently, the FCC is seen by the
youth as a haven of peace. We give them some distractions. The Centre is surrounded by
walls, and we grow plants to isolate it. Naturally, this constitutes another isolation
inside but unfortunately we cannot do differently. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;The place is extremely small, it&#146;s what I dislike in Gaza.
And then to get out, one has to pass through Erez, the border is something unpleasant...
What I dislike also in Gaza is the constant watch over everything, it&#146;s heavy...
sometimes tiring... Otherwise, I like the beach and the people. The people are wonderful,
really friendly, extremely friendly. It&#146;s what I like in Gaza.&#148;</p>

<i><b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Adel Altaher</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Palestinians have been known for their heroism, sacrifice, courage,
dedication, and above all, their loyalty to their homeland and to their identity as
Palestinians. Surely there were exceptions to the rule, but we always felt proud and
honoured to declare our Palestinian and Arab identity. It is like associating oneself with
the good traits that any man or woman likes to be associated with and described by. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Honour is the token that each man struggled to capture and strove to
keep. Honour is the treasure that if lost, one&#146;s life was not worth living. I grew up
in that environment; I knew what honour meant; I knew the price of honour, and I loved
that envious look in people&#146;s eyes when I declare my identity: &#147;I am a
Palestinian; I am an Arab.&#148; Simply, we had established the new measures of honour. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We Palestinians have raced amongst ourselves to earn this honour. We
displayed our courage, sacrifice and dedication to our cause. Death to us was the utmost
honour one can achieve while fighting to liberate Palestine. Each fallen man and woman was
one step closer to a Free Palestine. We had a deep conviction that our fallen bodies were
the bridge for our people to cross back to Palestine. We raced for the chance to earn that
honour, and the dream of taking our people back to Palestine never parted us. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We sang to the land. We lived with our captured images of Palestine. We
lived in camps, in shaggy tents donated by others. We did not want more for we had faith
that our situation would not last for long. After waiting, hoping and dreaming, we
realized that no one would take us back to our Palestine unless we did it ourselves. We
fought the Zionist enemy. Men, women and children, all together, sacrificing all that we
could to liberate our land from the invaders. Those who stayed back and did not fight to
liberate Palestine were chased away by our women, and our young looked down upon them. Our
women forbade themselves but for a man&#146;s seed of honour. They simply thought no man
is worthy of a Palestinian woman except a man with a well-earned history of honour. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We serenaded the courageous ones and praised the fallen ones. Our
mothers did not cry for their lost ones, but rather a teardrop always forced its way
missing the dear ones. We had full faith that we will all meet in Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our love for Palestine was a unique one. Our love for Palestine grew
deeper with every drop of blood that mixed with the dust. Palestine grew to be the mother,
the father, the brother, the sister, the child, and all the dear and loved ones who
refused but to be a root for an olive tree in Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world stood silent, while we urged for help. The world turned their
heads, while we were being slaughtered. The world turned deaf to our screams for help.
They laughed with joy at the screams of pain, and sipped on their liquor while amusing
themselves listening to the screams of the raped ones. They were more amused to learn what
pain can make one do. The world watched our falling bodies and watched us bleed. We knew
then that we were all alone. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what it is like to see your dad being beaten to death? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what it is like seeing your mother being raped? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what it is like seeing your unborn child forced out of your
wife&#146;s tummy with a knife? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what it is like when you hold your child in pieces? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what is like when a human is degraded out of his humanity? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what it is like watching your life being shattered and
being raped of your dreams? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you know what it is like being oppressed and being deprived of your
freedom? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure you don&#146;t&#133; because if you did, you would have never
called me a terrorist. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we terrorists because we said &#147;NO MORE&#148;? Are we
terrorists because we refused to be sub-human? Are we terrorists because we retaliated?
Are we terrorists because we interrupted your joy of watching us bleed? Or are we
terrorists because our love for Palestine is simply so deep? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did I hurt your feelings? Did I make you cry? Did I turn your stomach
with disgust? Or should I just let you watch me bleed? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To our martyrs&#151;I salute you; I salute your courage; I salute your
sacrifices; I salute the earth that mixed with your blood; and I salute the mothers who
gave birth to men and women like you. I decorate you with the utmost honour that can only
be carried by men and women like you. We are still on the same road, and we have not
forgotten our oath. The oath that we took upon ourselves with the first drop of blood that
mixed with sweat and dust. Your sacrifices are not wasted. The bridge to Palestine is
being built, and we are still on the road to our Freedom. </p>

  </i><p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>( 2-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">The Ethic of Nobility</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The contention that the ethic of resentment underpins Western
constructions of Islam must remain unsubstantiated until it can be demonstrated that
indeed Islam is based on an ethic of nobility, as Nietzsche claims, and that there are
identifiable reasons for Christian and Western resentment and fear of Islam. The Islamic
civilization and its discourses have basically two major components. One is the
glorification and celebration of itself as the final word of God and the realization of
His will on Earth.21 The second is the internal dialectic of self overcoming itself. The
first discursive quality can be understood as something common to all major civilizations
that have not consciously manufactured an &#147;other&#148; to function as a yardstick to
define self. It is the second, historical quality of Islam that suggests to me that it is
based on the ethic of nobility. This devotion to the Oneness and Will of the Ultimate also
explains the cyclical tendency to &#147;purify self&#148; through various revivalist
movements and also gives insights into the historical roots of the current global
resurgence of Islam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Revivalism is not a new phenomenon in the history of Islam. There is an
intrinsic dialectic within Islam, which is exclusive and unique. This dialectic is between
Islam and the un-Islam, between <i>haqq</i> (truth) and <i>batil</i> (falsehood). Thus
each time social developments move away from the basic teachings of Islam within the
Muslim society, there comes a <i>mujaddid</i> (reviver)22 who starts a process of revival
&#151; purification &#151; of Islam. Recurring movements of resurgence are a dialectic
intrinsic to Islam in order to guarantee its continuity. In other words, Islam is itself a
process of <i>tajdid</i> (renewal). Indeed as Esposito identifies, <i>tajdid </i>and <i>islah
</i>(reform) are the fundamental components of Islam&#146;s world view and history.23 The
Prophet Muhammed (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the first <i>mujaddid</i>
of Islam who restored and purified the <i>din al Ibrahim</i> (the religion of Abraham).
Indeed it can be stated that revivalism is a fundamentally reconstitutive element of
Islam.24 This self renewal can be seen also in the light of Nietzsche&#146;s ethic of
nobility. It is indeed an in-built process which lets history evolve through a constant
effort to overcome self. Islam becomes Islam again and again in history through a process
of overcoming itself. It does not need an &#147;other&#148; in order to overcome and
assert itself. This is without doubt the source of the strength and vitality of Islam, and
this makes it so difficult to make it disappear. The return of Islam in Turkey after four
decades of totalitarian imposition of secularism is one of the many contemporary
manifestations of Islam&#146;s rejuvenative character, its ability to overcome itself and
emerge in a renewed and reformed self.25</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Roots of Christian and Western Resentment</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The rise of Islam, both in numbers of adherents and territorial expansion,
in conjunction with its claim that it is the final and the unadulterated revelation of
God, threatened Christian claims to the same. The phenomenal expansion of Islam compelled
Christian theologians and thinkers to discredit it. Western scholars, philosophers as well
as theologians, refused to treat Islam on its own terms and continued to brand it as a
Christian heresy and the Prophet of Islam as an evil and even insane heretic. This was
further compounded by the failure of Christian missionaries to convert Muslims to
Christianity while the opposite seemed to happen at an alarming rate &#151; from India in
the East to Spain in the West. Moreover, while Jews and Christians heaped abuse on Islam
and its prophet, Islam itself embraced Moses and Jesus as prophets of Islam worthy of
respect and reverence. As Daniel Pipes argues, the Church&#146;s resentment of Islam led
to a polemic strategy designed to discredit Islam&#146;s claim to true revelation by
denying the prophethood of Muhammad. The advent of the Crusades transformed this
theological resentment into a civilizational one after the Christians&#146; defeat.26
Islam&#146;s parallel claims and its relatively greater success in realizing these claims
were the primary source of Christian resentment against Islam during the Medieval period
in Europe and the coeval Classical period in the Islamic World. This resentment led to the
development of Orientalism and the construction of the quintessential &#147;other,&#148;
namely, Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One can understand the resentment against a powerful other. The
persistence of the ethic of resentment against a much diminisshed and even marginalized
Islam, however, is both unhealthy and irrational. While resentment in the first case led
to a creative response and competition that has undoubtedly contributed to the reform,
enlightenment, and incredible development of the modern West, the persistence of that
sentiment only weakens it. The current search for another &#147;arch evil enemy&#148; is
rapidly refocusing on Islam. While there are some reasons for the present resentment,
Islam does not present a sufficient challenge or threat to the global hegemony of the West
and its new values to warrant relaunching the crusades &#151; this time not in the name of
Christianity but of Western Civilization. The contemporary resurgence of Islam does not
really threaten Western societies or Western democracies.27 But it does definitely
increase the cost of Western domination and hegemony over Muslim lands.28 This state
affairs, while complicating post-Cold-War redefinition of global politics, does not merit
the bogey-man image that Islam held prior to the emergence of the modern world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The balance of power in premodern times was distinctly in favor of Islam,
which may simplisticly explain the ethic of resentment dominating Christian sensibilities
and attitudes toward Islam. Since the balance of power today is so overwhelmingly in favor
of the West, what then is the reason for the perpetuation of resentment? The answer lies
perhaps in De Tocqueville&#146;s argument that the love of equality in Western society is
invariably accompanied by the sentiment of envy and resentment.29 De Tocqueville argues
that a sense of resentment and even intolerance of difference and distinction underpins
the love of equality, often understood as homogenizing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He asserts that the love of equality, which is basic to democratic
societies, often manifests a terrible intolerance of the &#147;other,&#148; very similar
to the Nietzschean depiction of slave morality and of whatever chooses to stand separate
from the majority.30 Following his argument that the source of this democratic sentiment
is essentially Christian ethics, it is not difficult to understand whence the concurrent
intolerance and resentment of the &#147;other&#148; also comes.31 Thus in the light of De
Tocqueville&#146;s insights, one may venture to advance the argument, carefully and
guardedly, that perhaps the democratic instinct is the purveyor of the ethic of resentment
and that pursuit of global equality and homegeneity is producing an extreme intolerance
toward the modern resurgence of Islam, which has already been labelled, <i>a priori,</i>
as undemocratic. While the discussion about the relation between the positioning of the
West as democratic and Islam as aristocratic/authoritarian and the ethic of resentment is
interesting and also germane to this paper, it unfortunately is beyond its scope. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Conclusion</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The argument that Orientalism essentially created an inferior and
antithetical Orient to function as the &#147;other&#148; for the purposes of
self-definition lends credence and also derives support from Nietzschean contentions that
the modern world has emerged from the Judeo-Christian ethic of resentment. My arguments
draw upon the post-Cold War hunt for another &#147;other,&#148; and its targeting of
Islam, to suggest that the ethic of resentment that determined Christian perceptions of
Islam continues to function in Western perceptions both of itself and of Islam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While there were justifications for <i>Christianity</i> to fear Islam,
there no longer are sufficient reasons for the <i>West</i> to harbor a similar fear of
Islam. Medieval Christendom was an underdog. The present West is by far the preponderant
and even dominant power. Indeed this preponderance of power in conjunction with the
consequences of colonization of Islamic lands may have even changed the nature of Islamic
morality &#151; from master to slave. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If one were to believe the analysis of Bernard Lewis and Fukuyama, who
argue that Islam has a lot to be resentful of in its relations with the West and even to
hate the West,32 then modern Islamic resurgence is indeed a fundamental departure from
traditional revivals. It is not based on <i>tajdid</i> (renewal) and <i>islah </i>(reform)
but stems merely from the resentment of a disadvantaged slave, as Fukuyama would have us
believe. If this is true, then the West has nothing to fear from Islam. The embracing of
the ethic of resentment will do to Islam what it did to Christianity &#151; secularize and
democratize it. The days of the other are over, if the other is on the way to embrace the
ways of oneself. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">Jewish Fundamentalism Within Jewish Society</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The religious-nationalist Jewish compromises with modernity regarding
women are exceedingly complicated in many ways. The Halacha forbids Jewish males to listen
to women singing whether in a choir or solo regardless of what is sung. This is stated
directly in the halachic ruling that a voice of a woman is adultery. This is interpreted
by later halachic rulings stipulating that the word &#147;voice&#148; here means a
woman&#146;s singing not speaking. This rule, originating in the Talmud, occurs in all
codes of law. A Jewish male who willingly listens to a woman&#146;s singing commits a sin
equivalent either to adultery or fornication. The great majority of NRP faithful members,
nevertheless, listen to women singing and thus commit &#147;adultery&#148; routinely. Some
of the most strict NRP members, especially among the religious settlers in the West Bank,
have not only puzzled over this problem but at times have tried to solve the problem of
how to adjust by developing creative approaches. In the early 1 990s some of the settlers
founded a new radio station, Arutz, or Channel, 7. For their station to become successful
and to appeal as broadly as possible to Israeli Jews, the settlers understood that the
songs of the fashionable singers of the day, some of whom were women, would have to be
broadcast. The rabbinical censor, however, has refused to allow a breach of the Halacha
whereby male listeners would hear female singers and thus commit &#147;adultery.&#148;
After further consultation with the censor, the settlers devised an acceptable solution
that is still being employed. Men sing the songs, made popular by women; the male voices
are then electronically changed to the female pitch and are broadcast accordingly over
Arutz 7. A part of the traditional public is satisfied by this expedient; and the learned
NRP rabbis insist that no adultery is committed when men listen to the songs being sung.
The Haredim obviously have rejected and condemned this accommodation and to date have
refused to listen to Arutz 7. Even more importantly, the Haredim, after increasing
somewhat their political power in the 1988 elections, were able to impose their position
in this regard upon the whole state by forcing a change in the opening of the new Knesset
session. The opening ceremony previously began with the singing of &#147;Hatikva,&#148;
the Israeli national anthem, by a mixed mal-female choir. After the 1988 election, in
deference to Haredi sensitivities, a male singer replaced the mixed choir. After the 1992
election, won by Labor, an all-male choir of the Military Rabbinate sang
&#147;Hatikva.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How can the Haredim, who altogether constitute only a small percentage of
Israel&#146;s Jewish population, at times, either alone or even with the help of the NRP,
impose their will upon the rest of society? The facile explanation is that both the Labor
and Likud parties kowtow to the Haredim for political support. This explanation is
insufficient. The kowtowing continued between 1984 and 1990 during the time that Labor and
Likud had formed a coalition. Curring favor from the Haredim for alignment purposes was
then politically unnecessary. The offered explanation, furthermore, does not adequately
take into account the special affinity of all the religious parties, perceived since 1980
as fundamentalist, to Likud and other secular tight-wing parties. This affinity,
especially between Likud and the Haredi religious parties, based upon a shared world
outlook, is at the crux of Israeli politics. (This affinity is analogous to that existing
between Christian and Muslim fundamentalists and their secular right parties.) The
relatively simple case of the NRP illustrates this well. The NRP recognizes, although does
not always follow, the same halachic authorities as do the Haredi parties. The NRP also
adheres to the same ideals relating to the Jewish past and, more importantly, to the
future when Israel&#146;s triumph over the non-Jews will allegedly be secure. The
differences between the NRP and the Haredim stem from the NRP&#146;s belief that
redemption has begun and will soon be completed by the irnminent coming of the Messiah.
The Haredim do not share this belief. The NRP believes that special circumstances at the
beginning of redemption justify temporary departures from the ideal that could help
advance the process of redemption. NRP support in some situations for military service for
talmudic scholars is a relevant example here. These deviant NRP ideas have been undermined
since the 1970s by the expanding Haredi influence upon increasing numbers of NRP followers
who have resisted departures from strict talmudic norms and have favored Haredi positions.
This process has been counter-balanced to some extent by the growth in prestige of the NRP
settlers who are esteemed as pioneers Minister Rabin by a messianist may have momentarily
increased Haredi prestige.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The religious influence upon the Israeli right-wing of Israel B is
attributable both to its militaristic character and its widely shared world outlook.
Secular and militaristic right-wing, Israeli Jews hold political views and engage in
rhetoric similar to that of religious Jews. For most Likud followers, &#147;Jewish
blood&#148; is the reason why Jews are in a different category than non-Jews, including,
of course, even those non-Jews who are Israeli citizens and who serve in the Israeli army.
For religious Jews, the blood of non-Jews has no intrinsic value; for Likud, it has
limited value. Menachem Begin&#146;s masterful use of such rhetoric about Gentiles brought
him votes and popularity and thus constitutes a case in point. The difference in this
respect between Labor and Likud is rhetorical but is nevertheless important in that it
reveals part of a world outlook. In 1982, for example, when the Israeli army occupied
Beirut, Rabin representing Labor, although advocating the same policies as favored by
Sharon and Likud, did not explain the Sabra and Shatila Camp massacres by stating, as did
Begin: &#147;Gentiles l::ill Gentiles and blame the Jews.&#148; Even if Rabin had himself
been capable of saying this, he knew that most of his secular supporters in Labor, who
distinguish between Gentiles who hate Jews and those who do not, would not have tolerated
such a statement. They would have repudiated such rhetoric as being both untrue and
harmful.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Religious influence is evident in the right&#146;s general reverence for
the Jewish past and its insistence that Jews have an historic right to an expanded Israel
extending beyond its present borders. More than other secular Israelis, members of the
Israeli right insist upon Jewish uniqueness. During many centuries of their existence, the
great majority of Jews were similar in some ways to the present-day Haredim. Thus, those
Jews who today revere the Jewish past as evidence of Jewish uniqueness respect to some
extent religious Jews as perpetuators of that past. An essential part of the right&#146;s
emphasis upon uniqueness is its hatred of the concept of &#147;normality,&#148; that is,
that Jews are similar to other people and have the same desire for stability as do other
nations. Some cultural affinities between secular and religious Jews of the Israeli right
are not primarily ideological. Many Likud supporters, whether Sephardic or Askikenazi in
origin, are traditionalists; they view rabbis as glamorous figures and are affected by
childhood memories of the patriarch4 family in which education was dominated by the
grandfather and the women &#147;knew their place.&#148; Although most pronounced in those
of the religious vanguard, such considerations also affect secular Jews of the right. The
right often exaggerates the beauty and superiority of the Jewish past, especially when
arguing for the preservation of Jewish uniqueness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The religious and secular members of the right share fears as well as
beliefs. In an October 6, 1993, article, published in <i>Haaretz, </i>Israel&#146;s most
prestigious daily Hebrew-language newspaper, Doron Rosenblum, relying upon varied sources,
illustrated this by quoting pronouncements of Likud leaders that were designed to show
Israelis the grave nature and risks of the peace process and at the same time to continue
the boasting that Likud had initiated the process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rosenbium quoted the following statement by Likud Member of the Knesset
(MK) Uzi Landau, who after the 1996 elections was appointed chairperson of the Knesset
Committee for Defense and Foreign Affairs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT">If Rabin&#146;s policies toward Syria are followed, one morning they
  [Israeli Jews] will awaken to see columns of Syrian tanks descending from the Golan
  Heights like herds of sheep ... The settlements of the Galilee will then be attacked by
  tire-power stronger than that used in [the war of] 1973... Since the idea of extermination
  of Israelis remains a topic in the Syrian consciousness ...any [Israeli] withdrawal from
  the Golan Heights will only precipitate the moment that the Syrian knife will approach the
  throat of every inhabitant of the Galilee.. Syrian policies are fixed by a genetic code
  not subject to rapid changes.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apparently keeping to its double-standard approach, the Western media,
which would almost certainly have blasted any non-Jewish politician for attributing
Israeli policies to a Jewish genetic code not subject to rapid changes, avoided commenting
upon the Landau statement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rosenblum also quoted MK Benny Begin, a major Likud leader, who expressed
the fear that Syria would make a frontal attack upon Israel. This fear is commonly
expressed by members of most Israeli political parties. What is characteristic of Israel
B, however, is that, as Benny Begin specifically declared, the aims of a Syrian invasion
will be the same as &#147;the aims of Pogromists of Kishinev to cut Jewish throats.&#148;<sup>
</sup>Begin added that this time nuclear scientists would help in the Syrian venture.
Comparing the unarmed Jewish community, a small minority in the Russian Empire, with
Israel and its army illustrates a common attitude to the Jewish past held by the secular
right-wing Israeli parties and the religious Jews. This attitude takes no cognizance of
historical development. Jews in whatever condition are always the real or potential
victims of Gentiles. -</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rosenblum, who is a member of Israel A, perceived all such imagery as
incongruous. Observing that Landau regarded the Syrians as sheep, he asked: &#147;Can it
be that he [Landau] means to say that we are wolves?&#148; Rosenblum then offered his
analysis of why this rhetoric has nevertheless been so persuasive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT">The suspicion is long-standing that members of the national camps [that
  is, the secular right] use power-mad rhetoric to cover their subliminal existential fear
  of the entire world. This fear was not dispelled in the slightest when the state of Israel
  was founded. Labor, in spite of all its faults, has succeeded by whatever means to cast
  aside such fear and replace it with a constructive and pragmatic world outlook. Likud,
  which resumed its historical note with ease, has not.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those chauvinistic Jews who speak with utmost confidence about
Israel&#146;s power and ability to impose its will upon the Middle East are most
susceptible to such fears. The same people who predict that a second Holocaust will almost
immediately occur if Israel makes any concession to the Arabs also often state
categorically that the Israeli army, if not restrained by politicians, by Americans, or by
leftist Jews, could conquer Baghdad within one week. (Ariel Sharon actually made this
claim a few months before the outbreak of the October 1973 war.) The fear and the
self-confidence co-exist harmoniously. The belief in Jewish uniqueness enhances this
co-existence. Most foreign observers do not realize that a sizeable segment of the Israeli
Jewish public holds these chauvinistic views. The schizophrenic blend of inordinate fears
and exaggerated self-confidence, common to the Israeli secular right and religious Jews,
resembles ideas held by anti-Semites who usually view Jews as being at the same time both
powerful and easy to defeat. This is one of the reasons why attitudes of Israeli
right-wing individuals toward the Gentiles, especially toward the Arabs, resemble so
closely the attitudes of anti-Semites toward the Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The secular right and the religious Jews also share other fears. They fear
the West and its public opinion. They fear and condemn Jewish leftists, a term
sufficiently broad to include most Labor followers, for not being sufficiently Jewish, for
preferring Arabs to Jews and for living lives of delusion. They view the left as dangerous
because of its ability to attract new recruits, especially from the ranks of the
country&#146;s intellectual elite.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ramadan falls in the ninth month of the Islamic year. It is a month of
fasting and piety ordained on all adult Muslims. Ramadan was designated because it is the
month in which Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) received the first
revelations of the Holy Qur&#146;an. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fast of each day in Ramadan begins with dawn and ends immediately
when the sun sets. During the hours of fasting, people must refrain from food, drink,
smoking and conjugal relations. The month of Ramadan is a month of contemplation and
worship. <i>Sawm</i>, or fasting, is the fourth pillar of Islam and another act of <i>Ibadah
</i>(worshipping God). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fasting helps develop self-control and helps us to overcome our human
weaknesses. It is a training programme that refreshes us and enables us to carry out some
of our duties towards God, who is our Creator and Sustainer. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fasting gives us the feeling of knowing what it is like to be hungry
and thirsty. We experience firsthand what it is like to have an empty stomach. This
experience develops empathy for the poor and hungry and enhances social responsibility. It
also teaches us discipline and to control our love of comfort. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fasting helps us to be truly obedient to God&#146;s commands. The month
of Ramadan, then, is a month of forgiveness, mercy and a means of avoiding the punishment
of Hell. Fasting is the one act that is performed solely for God&#146;s sake. All other
acts are performed for our own sakes. Furthermore, those faithful who fast will enter
Paradise through a special gate called Al-Rayyan. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fasting helps us to control our passions and enables us to become
people of good deeds and intentions. In fasting, we blend the brotherhood of man with
individual self-discipline. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And when we are hungry, our sense of gratitude towards God is awakened,
and it is then that we can rightly measure and truly appreciate the countless blessings of
our Lord once we are deprived of them. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fasting has an immense impact on society, for all Muslims, irrespective
of their status in life, must observe the obligatory fasting during the same month. This
brings to light the essential equality of men and should, too, create in them sentiments
of love and brotherhood. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fasting sharpens our will-power and helps make us less enslaved to our
bodily passions. It is in fasting that the spirit has control over the body and where man
has full control over his body without being a slave to his physical needs or desires. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of fasting in other religions is somewhat partial. It is
either for spiritual goals, physical needs, or cultivating the intellect, but never for
all three combined. However, in Islam, fasting is for all these gains and for many other
purposes, including social and economic, moral and humanitarian, private and public,
personal and common, and inner and outer. And, since the Islamic calendar is a lunar one,
the month of Ramadan, even though it is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, occurs
during different seasons of the year. Thus, the one who fasts experiences the spiritual
flavour of Ramadan at variant seasons and variant climates. Sometimes Ramadan falls during
long and hot summer days, sometimes during short and cold winter days, sometimes during
cool and beautiful spring or fall days. Thus, fasting entails an unfailing effort on the
part of the Muslim believer to be ready, dynamic and adaptable. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wherever you are, whoever you are, may you have a spiritually rich and
ever-after rewarding Ramadan. Ramadan Mubarak! </p>

Alfred. Alfred was a hard-working young man who tilled his land with the love of his heart
and the toil of his hands. Each day he would go out to the fields and dig his sweet earth
in order to provide for his belligerent wife. Yet, no matter how hard he worked or how
many crops he sold, he just never seemed to please her.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each evening, as he trudged home from his fields where grew his dreams
and all the wildflowers anyone could ever imagine, he would say to himself, &#147;Oh, I
hope that my Rose will be happy! One day, I am going to buy for her the most beautiful
dress and the finest shawl just so that I can see for once her eyes shine with joy and
hear her tell me how much she appreciates me!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alfred&#146;s way home was scented with the aroma of pine trees, green
grass and honey nectar. Bees happily buzzed over his head, nightingales filled the
surrounding forests with song, and furry little animals scampered out of his way as his
boots stomped away those acres before he reached his small and humble cottage. But to him,
his cottage was his palace and in his dreams, the walls of his cottage were made of
sunflowers so bright they shone like gold.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His stomach growled and he panted with thirst. He could hardly wait to
eat, to drink and to fill his stomach with something warm and satisfying. Soon, he reached
the door of his humble cottage and thrust it open with his right hand. Inside he was met
by his Rose&#146;s frown. He almost felt like going back out into the fields again, but
his hunger and fatigue persuaded him not to.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>&#147;Rose, I&#146;m home! What&#146;s for dinner? I&#146;m so hungry
I could eat a horse!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;We&#146;re having broth and bones tonight. That&#146;s all I had
to cook.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;But, Rose! I bought you more than a kilo of lamb to cook for
supper tonight. What happened to it all?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He noticed her frown growing wider and deeper as she said in the most
irritated voice he knew she had, &#147;It&#146;s your sister!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;My sister?&#148; he queried. &#147;What has my sister got to do
with the meat I bought for dinner?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;She ate it all!&#148; His wife almost shouted to him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;But she lives far away from us; how could you even say such a
thing?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Distance never stopped her from coming and eating our food before
now, did it?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What could poor Alfred say? His sister had come, according to his wife,
and eaten all their meat, leaving nothing but bones. He was so hungry and had imagined
gulping down a succulent meal as he plowed his fields earlier in the day. Now, he would
have to try to fill his stomach with mere broth and bones. He loved his sister, but this
was not the first time that she had come while he was in the fields and eaten all the good
food. Well, he would have to see about that. Now he was tired, and even the broth and
bones would not taste so bad.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next day, Alfred returned to his fields as always. But on the way home,
he stopped by a village store to buy some more meat for dinner the following evening.
Surely, his sister would not come back again so soon and he could enjoy a good meal. When
he reached home, he told his scowling wife, &#147;Here is some more meat. Please cook it
for us tomorrow.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He almost stumbled and fell when she wrenched the meat from his hand
and hastily threw it in a pot to cook for the morrow. He quickly ate and almost as soon as
he hit his bed, he was fast asleep.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day, he set off for his fields with a quick and almost happy
step. Tonight, for dinner, he would eat a good meal. He had not had a good, rewarding,
filling meal in a long time it seemed. He worked away the hours and as the sun set, he
whistled his way home, taking in all the glory of the soft hues of the sinking summer sun.
Tonight just seemed especially beautiful. He could hear every bird sing, could almost hear
the grass growing, too, and this evening, the wildflowers and pine trees emitted a special
aroma. Indeed, he was in his Paradise Lost.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As soon as he got home, he burst through the door and hollered to his
wife, &#147;Rose, I&#146;m home. Did you finish cooking? I&#146;m starving!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He could see the sullen expression on her face but he did not believe
his ears when she replied in her usual snide way, &#147;I am cooking soup tonight.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>&#147;What?&#148; He must not be hearing right. He must be too tired.
&#147;What are you saying?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;You heard me!&#148; she answered. &#147;I said we are having soup
tonight.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He could feel his heart fall with a thud and knew that his face
reflected his disappointment. And he almost screamed out his next response to his wife.
&#147;Come on now! Don&#146;t try to tell me my sister came and ate all the meat
again!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;That is exactly what happened,&#148; she dryly answered with no
expression on her eternally sour, dour face. &#147;Your sister came and ate all the meat
as if there was no one else in the whole world but her. I was horrified to see what a
glutton she made of herself!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He had to do something about this whole affair. Perhaps it was his
greedy sister that was causing his wife to be so grouchy and grumpy all the time. He found
it hard to believe, but for some time, ever since his wife began to complain about his
sister, she had turned into a grouchier, grumpier person that she had ever been before. He
could not believe the evil thoughts that started growing in his mind and heart. Evil
thoughts and intentions for his sister, the sister that he once had loved more than
anything in the world until he married. But that seemed like an eternity ago, and this was
now. His sister did not appreciate how hard he worked and how hungry he was every evening
when he went home from the fields. She had become greedy and selfish and hogged down his
food. What would she do next? He had to protect his rights and even his health.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, every day when Alfred went to the fields, he plotted ways to stop
his sister from taking advantage of his wife&#146;s good hospitality. And finally, one
night, on his return home, he found his sister waiting to see him. When he entered his
small and once cherished cottage, he saw her face light up and she ran to him, hugging
him, saying, &#147;Oh dearest brother! It has been so long since we have seen each
other!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Yes, too long.&#148; Was all he could muster up. And then, he
added, &#147;Why don&#146;t you stay the night? We have an extra room where you can sleep.
You know, the room we are saving for the baby we are still hoping to have.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Yes, brother. Thank you for your kindness. Don&#146;t worry, one
day you will have that baby you so want, God willing!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His wife sat with his sister and they talked about small things, though
he noticed his wife begrudgingly making whatever conversation she managed. But really, he
didn&#146;t blame her. His sister was trying to ruin their marriage and take all they had
for her own selfish purposes! He went outside and began to dig for scorpions and hunt for
snakes. Much later, he filled several cans with scorpions and other cans with snakes. He
slipped past his wife and sister and placed the cans in his sister&#146;s room, knowing
that she would notice them and open them and then he would be rid of her forever!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He said good night and went off to bed. His sister soon went to her
room and his wife joined him. Meanwhile, when his sister was alone, she noticed the cans
sitting all around the room. &#147;What could be here in these cans, and are they for
me?&#148; she wondered.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She opened the first can and it was full of gold coins. She opened a
second can and it was full of diamond necklaces. She opened yet another can and it was
full of gold bracelets. All she could say was, &#147;That is good. I will shut them and
keep them for my brother, for he deserves the best always and, after all, he is the one
who works so hard. I am happy that he seems to be doing so well. He can now afford to
build a bigger house, get some hired help and live an easier life.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With these thoughts and a smile on her face, she fell asleep. Next
morning, expecting to see her dead, Alfred slowly opened her door. He found her dressed
and looking clean and fresh. His eyes almost popped out of his head, but he managed to
say, &#147;UMMMMMMM, well, did you sleep well last night, sister?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Oh yes, dearest brother. I slept better than I have for a long,
long time. Here, my brother, please take these cans and put them in a safe place. They are
yours.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He retreated a few steps backwards and said in an almost inaudible
voice, &#147;No, these cans are for you. You must take them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She moved closer to him, holding out one of the cans. &#147;I cannot
take your gold and diamonds! I want you to have them. You deserve all the best in
life!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gold? Diamonds? What was she talking about? He looked into the can she
was holding and sure enough, gold coins almost too bright to look at, filled the can to
the brim. He blinked several times, pinched himself even, thinking he must be dreaming.
But he was awake, more awake than he had been in ages.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His sister took another can and in delight spoke, &#147;Look, dearest
brother, this can has diamond necklaces! How could I ever accept such gifts from
you?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then Alfred knew that his sister was innocent. For, had she been
guilty, the snakes and scorpions would have killed her and had she been greedy as his wife
constantly accused her of being, she would not have refused gifts of gold and diamonds.
Now he knew his wife had been lying all along. So he ashamedly told his sister all that
had happened and how he had actually filled the cans with snakes and scorpions to kill his
only sister.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was sad and very quiet. For a long time, she said nothing, even
though her brother cried and apologized to her. He could see all the hurt on her face and
in her eyes. But all she said was, &#147;I am so sorry for you, my dear brother. You must
have been living in such misery that it has clouded your thinking. I have never been to
your house in over a year and, of course, would not ever think of eating all your meat or
your food. Surely, you must remember me for not ever being selfish or taking advantage of
anyone&#146;s hospitality, especially yours. I think your wife has been feeding the meat
you bring to a secret person who she just might be having an affair with.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His sister was right. Alfred discovered that his wife did have a secret
male friend that she used to feed all the good meat to. So he did the most honourable
thing he could think of doing. He divorced his Rose, for her thorns were too sharp and had
pricked him one too many times. He later remarried and now has an enlarged cottage full of
young ones and a heart full of happiness. He considers himself to be the richest man in
the world and when his sister comes for a visit, she is always welcome!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the cans filled with gold and diamonds, Alfred insisted that he
and his sister divide the treasure in half. Though he gained a fortune and so did his
sister, they gained so much more when they re-gained one another and renewed their faith
in God.</p>
