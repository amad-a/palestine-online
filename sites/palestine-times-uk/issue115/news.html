<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Bloody repression continues despite resumption of
talks</font></b></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron, West Bank</b> <b>&#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli occupation army kept up its bloody repression of the
Palestinian uprising despite the resumption of &#147;peace talks&#148; between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority, employing a variety of extremely harsh tactics ranging from
cold-blooded assassination of intifada activists to economic strangulation against the
overall Palestinian population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 December, Israeli soldiers and settlers killed at least four more
Palestinians, bringing the Palestinian death toll since the outbreak of the current
uprising to a total of 326, of whom as many as 50 are children, according to figures
released by the Palestinian health ministry.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two of the latest victims were killed in Rafah at the southern tip of the
Gaza Strip when an Israeli tank deployed at a small neighbouring Jewish settlement fired a
salvo of machine-gun rounds at Palestinians who reportedly were just walking around,
killing the two and seriously wounding five others.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army claimed its soldiers only returned fire, a claim rejected
by the Palestinians who descried the incident as &#147;another cold-blooded carnage.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eye-witnesses said the two men were killed when they sought to help
another Palestinian who had been shot and wounded by Israeli troops near the Salah al-Din
gate crossing near the Egyptian borders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The witnesses stressed that no &#147;clashes&#148; or
&#147;confrontations&#148; had taken place in the immediate locality where the incident
took place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the same day, two more Palestinians were also killed: the first, a
16-year-old boy from the village of Shugba, near Ramallah, was shot dead by a Jewish
settler who alleged that the boy stoned his car. And the second, a Fatah activist named
Samih Mala&#146;bi, was killed when a bomb, which local sources said was earlier given to
him by a Shin Bet agent, exploded in his hands, killing him instantly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 18 December, the dead body of another Fatah field activist, 24-year-old
Rashid Harun Abu al-Hasan, was found buried near Tulkarm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA said a Palestinian collaborator confessed to having killed Abu
al-Hasan, carrying out instructions to that effect from his Shin Bet boss.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mala&#146;bi and Abu al-Hasan are added to the list of some 25 Palestinian
activists who have been assassinated or killed in &#147;work accidents&#148; by Israeli
troops.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While most of the victims were affiliated with Fateh, the PLO&#146;s main
faction headed by Yasser Arafat, about seven of them were members of the Hamas military
wing and at least one was associated with the Islamic Jihad organization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, most of the Islamist victims were only recently released
from PA custody, a fact that prompted some Hamas leaders to raise suspicions about
possible &#147;foul-play&#148; by some PA security agencies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Hamas has no hard proof to corroborate its suspicions, hence it has
not made any public accusations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamist sources said the movement is keen to maintain &#147;national
unity&#148; with other movements, particularly Fateh, which leads the intifada and has
borne the brunt of Israeli repression of it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the fact that the Israeli occupation army and settlers target
all Palestinians irrespective of their political and ideological orientations makes Hamas
think twice before pointing a finger of accusation at anybody, including the PA security
agencies, which had until recently actively collaborated with Israel against the
Islamists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killings on 17 December were preceded by a series of murderous
assassinations, including at least one extra-judicial execution of a Palestinian child in
downtown Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Three Hamas activists, who had been affiliated with the movement&#146;s
military wing, were killed by Israeli snipers in Hebron, Nablus and Gaza. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 13 October, for example, Israeli snipers or undercover agents killed
Abbas Iweiwi, a former member of the Hamas military wing, while standing outside his shop
in the heart of PA-controlled Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Iweiwi had been freed from a PA jail a few weeks earlier, and his death
came less than 24 hours after the killing of another Islamist activist in the Nablus area,
who reportedly had been linked with past attacks on Israeli targets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A particularly gruesome murder had taken place in Hebron three days
earlier (on 10 December) when Israeli undercover soldiers disguised as &#147;Arabs&#148;
chased and shot at a group of stone-throwing children outside the Ali Bakka Mosque in the
PA-controlled part of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All of the children fled, except a single 14-year-old, identified as Ahmed
Qawasmi, who for some unexplained reason was so terrorized that he couldn&#146;t escape.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The hair-raising story of what happened to Qawasmi next is best told by
Ashraf Julani, a neighbour who witnessed the incident from beginning to end. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;While I was sitting on the balcony of my home in Harat al-Sheikh, I
heard, then I saw an Israeli soldier chasing Ahmed. The soldier captured the child,
dragged him to the ground and pressed his boot against Ahmed&#146;s neck. I then saw the
soldier shoot the child in the forehead while four other soldiers stood shooting eastward
in the alley leading to the mosque.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Hebron child, Sami Jaber, is still fighting for his life at a
Jerusalem hospital, having also been shot at point-blank range by skullcap-wearing,
machine-gun-wielding settlers who stormed the twice-demolished and twice-rebuilt home of
Atta Jaber, the child&#146;s uncle, in the Baqa&#146;a neighbourhood in Hebron for the
purpose of seizing the home and expelling the Arab family.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers, who had brought furniture, an Israeli flag and religious
books, immediately opened fire on the terrified Jaber family without any prior warning,
seriously injuring little Sami.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Later, the settlers claimed they were only shooting into the air and that
they couldn&#146;t be held responsible for the life-threatening injuries sustained by
Sami.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The child&#146;s father, grieving and shocked, scoffed at the
settlers&#146; claim saying, &#147;I didn&#146;t know that my little child had wings and
that he could fly.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the incident, the settlers, in full view of the Israeli
soldiers, moved about the Baqa&#146;a neighbourhood, attacking and terrorizing unarmed and
unprotected Palestinian civilians who, ironically, completely depend on the Israeli army
for protection from the rampaging settlers.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli torment continues unabated</b></u><br>
In addition to the wanton killing of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers and settlers, the
Israeli army continued to torment the general Palestinian population with harshness and
vindictiveness unprecedented since Israel seized the occupied territories in 1967.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This takes several blatant manifestations, including the sealing off of
roads and routes linking the villages with the outside world with earth and concrete slabs
and digging ditches to prevent Palestinians from using alternative routes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, when some Palestinians succeed in finding alternative roads, the
Israeli soldiers quickly place large piles of earth on the newly found paths.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, if that doesn&#146;t work, the soldiers simply pull the trigger,
injuring, maiming or even killing desperate civilians who could be struggling to take a
patient to the nearest hospital or simply returning home for Iftar, the meal which breaks
Ramadan&#146;s day-long fast.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The effective confinement of tens of thousands of Palestinians to their
immediate villages and hamlets is normally carried out for the purpose of guaranteeing
safe travel for the usually few Jewish settler families living in neighbouring settlement
outposts and using bypass roads passing through or near Arab villages and hamlets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The draconian measure reflects the extent to which the Israeli army has
become merely a tool in the hands of the settlers, who continue to press the Barak
government to &#147;untie the hands of the army and enable it to achieve total victory
over the Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear what the settlers mean by &#147;total victory.&#148;
However, in Gush Emunim literature, total victory is achieved if the &#147;war&#148; ends
up with either the extermination or capitulation of the enemy!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sealing off of roads is often accompanied by the bulldozing and
destruction of vast stretches of some of the most fertile land in both the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The callous uprooting of olive, banana and citrus groves along with the
utter destruction of green houses are carried out with unmistakable vindictiveness,
suggesting the act has only little to do with legitimate security considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, the losses of
Palestinian farmers from the destruction of their trees&#150;the main source of their
livelihood&#150;has topped $30 million.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When faced with this cruelty, the poor Palestinian farmers have no where
to look for help except heavenward. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Intifada still strong</b></u><br>
Despite the enormous loss of human lives and the economic disaster they have incurred,
most Palestinians are still determined to keep up the intifada until &#147;freedom,
liberation and independence&#148; are achieved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such dignified but clearly costly postures are voiced on a daily basis by
all political movements and ostensibly by the average man in the street.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The intifada is uncontainable and will continue until we achieve our
independence, regardless of what any leadership thinks,&#148; vowed Fateh chief in the
West Bank Marwan el-Barghouthi.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barghouthi&#146;s message, which many observers think is at variance with
Yasser Arafat&#146;s way of thinking, is echoed virtually throughout the occupied
territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, 15 December, over 30,000 Hamas supporters, converged on the
Yarmouk stadium in Gaza to voice the same message.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Salah Shehadeh, the founder of the Hamas military wing who had spent a
12-year prison term in Israel, vowed to go on no matter what the PA leadership says or
does.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I say to you that the blood of our brothers will not go in vain; we
will strike back, sooner rather than later,&#148; warned Shehadeh, surrounded by
rifle-toting members of the movement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They (the Israelis) only understand the language of force; we either
die as martyrs in the field, or they will murder us in our own towns.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, threats from Fatah and Hamas have been largely rhetorical, partly
because the two movements, indeed the entire Palestinian society, have not been adequately
prepared for the outbreak of the intifada, much less for its continuity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is widely expected that at least some of the rhetoric will be
translated into &#147;qualitative attacks&#148; on Israeli targets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such attacks will become more likely, even inevitable, if the Washington
talks collapse. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Grief overshadows holiday season </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the advent of the holiday season, the Israeli occupation army kept
up its bloody grip over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, shedding still more blood and
inflicting more suffering and havoc on the virtually unprotected Palestinian population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 20 December, the Israeli army, using artillery shells and
rocket-propelled grenades, bombarded the city of Rafah at the southern tip of the Gaza
Strip during the quiet hours before dawn, killing one boy and seriously injuring scores of
innocent civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The heavy bombardment targeted a small refugee camp known as Yibna and two
schools, as well as the Rafah residential areas opposite Jewish settlements in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the injured were three sisters and a one-year-old baby and her
mother, who were hit by shrapnel while in the bedroom of their home. As many as 60 other
civilians were also injured either directly by random bullets or by artillery shell
shrapnel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Around the same time, an Israeli tank stationed outside the Jewish
settlement of Navi Dakalim fired an artillery shell at a Palestinian Red Crescent vehicle,
killing two paramedics and injuring two others seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attack seemed to be another cold-blooded and totally unprovoked
murder. All the Israeli army said about the incident is that it was investigating what
happened, a routine statement that is ostensibly meant to consign such crimes to oblivion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same day had earlier witnessed a third crime when trigger-happy
Israeli soldiers stationed at the Erez checkpoint on the northern edge of the Strip opened
fire on a group of Palestinian labourers who were only verbally protesting humiliating
Israeli measures, including forcing the workers to undress and the use of dogs to search
them. As a result, two workers were shot and injured, a price they had to pay for trying
to maintain a semblance of personal dignity, something the Israeli army seemingly
considers intolerable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 22 December, two more Palestinians were killed in the Hebron area, one
of them a passer-by named Najib Ibedo, 22, whom eyewitnesses testify was killed also in a
cold-blooded manner by Jewish settlers from the small settlement of Haggay at
Hebron&#146;s southern outskirts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As of this writing (25 December), the Israeli army is still refusing to
hand over the youth&#146;s body, demanding that his family first undertake not to ask the
court to carry out an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding
Ibedo&#146;s death.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, the Israeli army sought to whitewash the murder by claiming that
Ibedo attempted to stab one of the settlers forcing the settler to shoot and kill him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, such stories are routinely concocted by the Israeli army
and then parroted by the Israeli media, which make little or no effort to ascertain the
truth, a telling fact showing the extent to which the Israeli media has become a tool in
the hands of the occupation army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also on Friday, 22 December, three Israeli army soldiers were seriously
wounded when a Palestinian suicidal-bomber, with explosives strapped to his body,
detonated himself at a café frequented by Israeli soldiers north of Jericho.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The man, whose identity has not yet been disclosed, is believed to have
been affiliated with the Islamic Jihad, the organization which promised to carry out
qualitative attacks on Israeli targets before the end of the year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the occupation authorities continued to isolate Palestinian
towns and villages throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, preventing the movement of
individuals and barring the flow of goods and services between towns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The result of this often hermetic blockade is predictable; Palestinians
are forced to adopt a &#147;survival economy&#148; whereby all efforts are devoted to
securing immediate needs such as food and fuel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In economic terms, this means that the overall production sector has come
to a standstill, incurring staggering losses estimated to be in the hundreds of millions
of dollars.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the harshest felt consequence of this virtual economic paralysis is
the laying off of many workers, thus further increasing the already inflated army of the
unemployed.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Holiday season</b></u><br>
With more than 330 youths and minors killed and over 12,000 others injured or maimed by
the Israeli army in the past three months and with their economy in ruins, it is no wonder
Palestinians, Muslims and Christians alike had very little to celebrate this holiday
season.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In sharp contrast to the traditional festive atmosphere in Bethlehem, the
Christmas celebrations this year had been conspicuously sombre, with the Manger Square
largely empty of the usual celebrants, pilgrims and tourists who would flood the narrow
streets of the birthplace of Christ.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The lugubrious atmosphere was so real and so stinging that the mayor of
Bethlehem, Hanna Nasser, labelled Christmas this year as &#147;probably the saddest since
the birth of Jesus Christ.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The absence of Christmas glamour was actually more than a gesture of
solidarity by Palestinian Christians toward their grief-stricken Muslim brothers and
countrymen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Christian communities of Bethlehem, Beit Jala and Beit Sahur were
themselves among the hardest hit by nearly nightly Israeli bombardment, resulting in
widespread destruction of houses and damage to hotels.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the Bethlehem area, where tourism is the backbone of the
local economy, is suffering a real economic depression these days owing to the Israeli
blockade and the uprising, which fend off tourists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now with the uprising expected to continue at least until after the
Israeli election slated for 6 February, it is likely that Bethlehem, indeed the entire
occupied territories, would have to embrace for still harder times.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, the economic hardships, however hard to cope with, are not
the main preoccupation of most Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The real preoccupation remains the sweeping desire of the Palestinians to
be free once and for all from the shackles of the Zionist occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This desire is evoked over and over again at every funeral procession and
at every protest when Palestinian youths chant, almost instinctively, &#147;give us arms,
we&#146;ll give you our souls.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">How Was Ramadan in Palestine?</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The holy month of Ramadan is normally a season for reflection, spiritual
enrichment and social solidarity. But in Palestine, where over 330 young Palestinians have
thus far been shot dead and many hundreds maimed by often trigger-happy Israeli soldiers
and settlers, the advent of the holy month this year has been impaled by bereavement,
grief, insecurity and turmoil unprecedented since Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in 1967.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, for a disproportionate number of Palestinian families that have
lost a son (in some cases two) or a husband to the ongoing uprising, the pain is truly
overwhelming, and life will never be the same.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some, like the mother of 14-year-old Karam al-Kurd of Rafah, who died on
the first day of Ramadan of wounds he had sustained in &#147;confrontations&#148; with
Israeli troops in Gaza a week earlier, find shelter in faith to gain fortitude. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;He didn&#146;t die; he is alive in the highest heaven with the
saints, angels and prophets of God,&#148; says the tearful mother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;God has taken him to His side; he is in a better place than we
are,&#148; she ads rather reassuringly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mrs. al-Kurd&#146;s ostensibly strong faith, however, only thinly conceals
a mother&#146;s instinctive love for her son. This innate feeling, which only a bereaved
mother can fully understand, often transcends reason, especially at the initial stages of
bereavement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mrs. al-Kurd expresses her profound grief at the loss of her son in a very
peculiar way. When the time for the fast-breaking meal is due, she dutifully keeps a place
for her son, as if he were to return home soon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such an expression of grief, though symbolic and unreasonable,
demonstrates the utter cheapness of Israeli-disseminated propaganda which claims that
Palestinian mothers have little compassion for their children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The month of Ramadan this year is not made bleak only by the large number
of Palestinian youngsters killed and maimed by Israeli soldiers and settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the Israeli army has been narrowing the Palestinians&#146;
horizons in every conceivable manner, all for the purpose of breaking their will and
convincing them that they can gain nothing by revolting against their tormentors and that
they had better come to terms with the fact that Israel has the upper hand.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The list of Israeli draconian measures to that effect is very long,
indeed. They encompass and transcend every aspect of Palestinian life, individual and
collective.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even simple tasks which one would take for granted, such as travelling
outside one&#146;s village or town for an emergency, or for buying food supplies or fuel,
becomes a formidable challenge since the &#147;mission&#148; is almost always fraught with
real danger and could end up with somebody getting injured or even killed by a stray
Israeli bullet.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Take, for example, Iyad Hantash who was shot and injured by Israeli
soldiers on the second day of Ramadan while returning to his village of Khursa, 20
kilometres south-west of Hebron, shortly before sunset.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The young man, who works as a construction plasterer, was returning home
for the Iftar meal when an Israeli soldier haphazardly opened fire at him without the
slightest provocation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked what he thought made the soldier shoot at him, Hantash said,
&#147;It seemed he just felt like it.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Others were not so lucky as Hantash. According to Palestinian sources, as
many as ten Palestinian civilians have been seriously wounded in similar circumstances
while walking or driving back to their homes to be with their families for the
fast-breaking Iftar meal. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli torment and harassment of the Palestinian inhabitants takes
many forms, some blunt, others insidious.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, in many localities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
Israeli army would simply shoot at power transformers shortly before sunset when family
members get together awaiting the Muezzin&#146;s call for prayer which marks the end of
another day&#146;s fast.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This rather vindictive form of harassment is meant to punish the
Palestinians for revolting against the Israeli occupiers who actually still tightly
control most aspects of Palestinian daily life. Indeed, the intifada and concomitant
Israeli repression have amply shown that seven years of the so-called peace process have
made very little difference. And, using the words of one Palestinian Legislative Council
member, it seemed that the whole thing (the peace process) was a big lie.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The cutting off of electricity to Palestinian population centres at
sensitive times of the day (at sunset and before dawn when people wake up for prayer and a
light meal known as <i>sahur</i>) only generates more bitterness and contempt for the
Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One newspaper editorial vowed that &#147;we may go back to the
pre-electricity age, but we will not give in to Zionist arrogance&#133;the occupation has
got to go.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Palestinians have actually sought to overcome the repeated blackouts
by fixing their old kerosene lamps.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, in some localities, especially in the Gaza Strip, even kerosene
lamps were difficult to maintain since fuel supplies are subject to Israeli approval. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Vindictive measures against Palestinians also take place at the micro
level. Earlier in December, Israeli soldiers manning a roadblock outside Hebron stopped a
Palestinian pick-up truck with five Jerry cans of olive oil on board.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The commanding officer forced the olive grower out of the car and gave him
the choice between death on the spot or spilling the oil on the ground. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poor farmer&#146;s wife eventually convinced him to opt for the lesser
of the two evils, arguing that &#147;God will compensate us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poor man eventually did what he was ordered to do at gunpoint, amid
the soldiers&#146; loud laughter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tearful at the humiliation, the poor farmer looked heavenward beseeching
God to destroy the oppressors.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Closure of Jerusalem</b></u><br>
One of the most disturbing aspects of the Israeli repression of the Palestinian uprising
has been the closure of Jerusalem to Palestinian worshipers on Fridays.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Normally, the Haram al-Sharif of Jerusalem is flooded with hundreds of
thousands of Muslim worshipers on Fridays during the month of Ramadan. This Ramadan,
however, the Israeli army and police turned the city into a huge garrison outpost, with
roadblocks erected at all routes leading to the Old City to prevent Palestinians from
reaching Islam&#146;s third holiest shrine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In many instances, worshipers, including the elderly, were mistreated and
even beaten by Israeli soldiers, and thousands of Muslims were forced to perform their
congregational prayers in the streets outside the boundaries of the city.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The virtual closure of the Haram al-Sharif was castigated by Palestinian
political and religious leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These stringent measures are a clear proof that religious freedoms
are virtually non-existent under the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem,&#148; said the Mufti
of Jerusalem and the whole of Palestine, Ikrema Sabri.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In our faith, there is no greater crime than preventing people from
going to the mosques and worshipping God.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA Jerusalem official, Faisal Husseini, said the barring of Muslims from
reaching the Haram al-Sharif repeated the same message.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They (the Israelis) lie to the whole world by claiming that all
believers are free to reach their respective holy places&#133;but as you see, they are
preventing people from reaching our mosques&#133;there can be no true freedom of worship
under occupation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli authorities claimed that the ban was necessitated by security
considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Israeli claim fails to explain why elderly men and women were
turned back at Israeli roadblocks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Muhammed Hussein, director-general of the Aqsa Mosque, opined that
the real reason is political in nature.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;As the battle for Jerusalem is gaining momentum, the Israeli
occupation authorities don&#146;t want the world to see how Jerusalem is important and
holy for Muslims&#133;they simply don&#146;t want to see half a million Muslims converge
on the city.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Talks resume while bloodshed continues;<br>
Israel on election footing</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Clinton Administration officials have been
meeting separately with Palestinian and Israeli negotiators at the Bolling Air Base near
Washington in a fresh effort to expedite the conclusion of a possible final-status
agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli and American sources gave &#147;optimistic evaluations of the
talks,&#148; suggesting that a &#147;deal&#148; was within reach if only the Palestinian
Authority made some concessions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These concessions, interestingly, include giving in on no less than the
heart of the Palestinian question, namely the cause of the refugees. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Prior to the commencement of the talks on 18 December, both Israeli and
Palestinian officials indicated that they did not have high expectations of an imminent
breakthrough. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA official Dr. Sa&#146;eb Ureikat, who leads the Palestinian delegation
to the talks, told the &#147;Voice of Palestine&#148; on 19 December that &#147;to be
honest, I don&#146;t have high expectations because (Israeli Prime Minister Ehud) Barak is
still intransigent about arrogating our rights and maintaining the Israeli military
occupation of our land in violation of international law.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, PA official Yasser Abed Rabbo, who also is taking part in the
Washington talks, remarked that a successful outcome of the talks depended on
Israel&#146;s willingness to evacuate from the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip in
accordance with UN resolutions 242 and 338, and accept an &#147;equitable&#148; settlement
of the refugee problem based on UN resolution 194. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli negotiators, on the other hand, appeared more concerned with
stopping &#147;the violence&#148; than with dealing with the root causes of it, namely
Israel&#146;s adamant refusal to terminate 33 years of its military occupation of the
Palestinian territories. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The main goal of the talks, as we see it, is to try to reduce
violence, stop incitement and restore calm to the region,&#148; said Gilad Sher, a senior
aid to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sher reportedly stopped short of saying that progress in the Washington
talks was predicated on the restoration of calm, a position which is ostensibly supported
by the Clinton Administration but utterly rejected by the Palestinians who insist that the
current uprising, with its enormous sacrifices, has effectively changed the rules of the
game and rendered any return to the status quo ante, e.g. the pre-intifada bargaining,
unrealistic and unacceptable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 December, the talks apparently reached a deadlock, with the Zionist
representatives backtracking from earlier positions regarding the West Bank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the Zionist Sher demanded again a foothold at the Haram
al-Sharif in Jerusalem, which nearly exploded the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met with the delegates to overcome the crisis but to no avail. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">U.S. President Clinton, a lame-duck with only four weeks to leave the
White House, was also due to meet with the delegates. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, few observers in Washington or in the Middle East expect any
breakthrough, given Zionist intransigence and adamant refusal to come to terms with
Palestinian rights. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, a flurry of diplomatic activities were taking place in parallel
to the talks, with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat arriving in Cairo to brief President Husni
Mubarak on the latest developments concerning the talks in Washington and the situation on
the ground in the occupied territories. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak, too, was busy dispatching emissaries to Amman and Cairo, apparently
to ask King Abdullah II and Mubarak to exert pressure on Yasser Arafat to &#147;show
flexibility in the talks,&#148; a euphemism for Palestinian concessions on the three
paramount issues of Jerusalem, the refugees and Jewish settlements. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To Israel&#146;s dismay, however, it is highly unlikely that the Egyptian
leadership will try to pressure Arafat to give further concessions to Israel, particularly
on the sensitive issue of Jerusalem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday, 16 October, President Mubarak, while addressing a joint session
of the newly elected People&#146;s Assembly and the Shura Council, made it clear that even
Arafat had no right or authority to take a final decision on Jerusalem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;No one has the right to surrender rights concerning Jerusalem. The
Palestinian leadership is not free to decide upon it because the matter concerns all
Muslim and Christian peoples.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Faced with a strong and united Palestinian, Arab and Muslim stance on
Jerusalem, the Barak government is reportedly seeking to extract other Palestinian
concessions on another equally paramount issue, namely the refugee problem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to semi-official Israeli sources, Israeli negotiators in
Washington will present a new Israeli proposal whereby Israel would agree to grant the
Palestinians &#147;practical sovereignty&#148; or &#147;de facto control&#148; over the
Haram al-Sharif compound in return for the renunciation by the PA of the right of return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This yet-to-be-refined proposal on the part of the Barak government was
spelled out earlier in the week by Israeli minister Yuli Tamir, who is close to Barak. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What is vital for us is to obtain the most important thing, the
renunciation by the Palestinians of the right of return of the refugees to 1948-territory.
This right of return is our greatest concern because we want to maintain the character and
the Jewish majority in Israel and renouncing this right is the only way to achieve
that.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the PA is unlikely to explicitly agree to renounce the
right of return since a fateful step as such would trigger widespread turmoil and
turbulence among the estimated five million refugees dispersed around the globe awaiting
to be repatriated to the homeland from which they were expelled at gunpoint when the
Jewish State was created in 1948. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, voted at dawn on Tuesday,
19 December, by 69 to 49 to hold only prime ministerial elections, but not general
elections, on 6 February. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The vote was a big disappointment and setback for former Israeli Prime
Minister Benyamin Netanyahu who had conditioned his candidacy for Prime Minister on a
Knesset decision to dissolve itself and decide on early parliamentary elections. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the Knesset vote, Netanyahu decided to withdraw his challenge
for the Likud leadership and for the post of Prime Minister. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest developments in Israel imply that Barak will be facing Likud
leader Ariel Sharon on 6 February, that is unless another former Prime Minister, Shimon
Peres, changes his mind about nominating himself for Prime Minister. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Opinion polls in Israel put Sharon ahead of Barak by several percentage
points. But this advantage for Sharon, say political experts, is likely to subside and may
vanish completely as the election date draws nearer. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, and despite the resumption of talks in Washington, the
Israeli occupation army kept up its bloody repression of the Palestinian uprising,
employing a variety of sinister tactics ranging from cold-blooded assassination of
intifada activists to economic strangulation of the Palestinian population. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the third week of December alone, the Israeli army and settlers
killed nearly 18 Palestinians, including three boys, in Gaza and the West Bank, bringing
the Palestinian death toll since the outbreak of the intifada to a total of 328. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two of the latest victims were killed in Rafah at the southern tip of the
Gaza Strip when an Israeli tank fired a salvo of machine-gun rounds at a group of
Palestinians who were just walking around, killing the two and seriously wounding five
others. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eyewitnesses said the two men were killed when they sought to help another
Palestinian who had been shot and wounded by Israeli troops near the Salah al-Din gate
crossing near the Palestine-Egypt borders. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killing on 17 December was preceded by a number of assassinations
targeting intifada activists. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 13 October, for example, Israeli snipers killed Abbas Iwewi, a former
member of the Hamas military wing, while standing outside his shop in the heart of Hebron.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Shin Bet agents in the Qalandia refugee camp near Jerusalem and in
the Tulkarm area also murdered at least two other intifada &#147;field leaders&#148;
during the week of 18 December. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the wanton killing, the Israeli army continued to torment
the general Palestinian population with harshness and vindictiveness unprecedented since
the Israeli occupation began in 1967. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The heavy-handed repression takes several blatant manifestations,
including the sealing off of roads and routs linking Palestinian population centres with
each other (using huge concrete slabs and big piles of earth) and the destruction of
Palestinian groves and fields for the purpose of ruining them economically and tormenting
them emotionally, given the Palestinians&#146; traditional attachment to their groves,
especially olive groves. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The harsh measures reflect the extent to which the Israeli army has become
a tool in the hands of Jewish settlers, who continue to press Barak to &#147;untie the
hands of the army and enable it to achieve total victory over the Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Gush Emunim literature, &#147;total victory&#148; usually means one of
two things: either the extermination or capitulation of the enemy.</p>
