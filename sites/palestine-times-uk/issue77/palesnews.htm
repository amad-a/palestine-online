<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Sheikh Yassin receives a hero's welcome in
Gaza;  </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>says Palestinians are peace-seekers</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman- Special to PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Following a call by King Hussein of Jordan to Israeli
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the 61-year-old
Palestinian founder of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, arrived in
Amman at King Hussein Medical Centre on 1 October after having spent eight
years in Israeli jails.  He received an official welcome by King Hussein
and senior Jordanian officials, including Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The saga of Sheikh Yassin, who was sentenced by an Israeli
court to life imprisonment plus 15 years for his role in anti-Israel attacks,
followed the assassination attempt by two Israeli Mossad agents of Hamas
politburo chief Khaled Misha'al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Mr. Misha'al escaped the assassination attempt but not
before a &quot;chemical substance&quot; was injected into his left ear which
caused &quot;dizziness, continuous vomiting and imbalance&quot; immediately
after the attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Following the attack against Mr. Misha'al, King Hussein
phoned the Israeli premier and threatened him that if Mr. Misha'al dies,
Jordan would cut diplomatic ties with Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Netanyahu, accompanied by his Defence Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, arrived in Amman on
29 September, but the King refused to meet them and sent his brother Crown
Prince Hassan instead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	During the extensive talks between Jordanian and Israeli
officials, the two sides agreed to release the two Israeli Mossad agents
involved in the attack against Mr. Misha'al in exchange for the release
of Sheikh Yassin and tens of Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;I am very pleased and happy with the swift reaction
[and for] the fact that Sheikh Ahmad Yassin arrived safely here. Now he
is resting and he receives the best care we can afford him. This is the
least we can do and I am happy to meet him for the first time,&quot; the
King said following the arrival of Sheikh Yassin at the King Hussein Medical
Centre in the Jordanian capital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A statement by the Israeli army said that &quot;the release
of Sheikh Yassin was declared at the recommendation of Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu who answered the call of King Hussein.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Addressing his family, supporters and journalists in the
Gaza Strip from the Hussein Medical Centre, Sheikh Yassin greeted them and
said that he would be returning in the near future and that his stopover
in Jordan was merely for treatment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A statement by Hamas said that the Sheikh's arrival in
Amman followed a written pledge, signed by the commander of the Israeli
army's southern region, that he would be allowed to return to the Gaza Strip
and that his arrival in Jordan is a &quot;release&quot; and not a &quot;deportation&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	During his short stay in Amman, Sheikh Yassin received
treatment and underwent some operations for his eye and ear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Sheikh Yassin, who established Hamas and its military
wing Izzedin Qassam Brigades in 1987 at the very beginning of the intifadah
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, was visited by the head of the Palestinian
Authority Yasser Arafat and other senior Palestinian officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Hamas leader, who is completely paralyzed and blind
in his right eye as a result of the torture he received while a prisoner
in Israeli jails, was accompanied by Raed Balboul, who was taking care of
the old man during his imprisonment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Sheikh Yassin also suffers from weakness of sight in his
left eye, a loss of hearing in his right ear and weak hearing in his left
ear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Prior to his departure from Amman to the Gaza Strip aboard
King Hussein's military helicopter, Sheikh Yassin held a press conference
and said that Hamas will not abandon armed struggle against Israel until
Israeli occupation is over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;We tell the whole world that we are peace-seekers.
We love peace, and we call upon them (the Israelis) to live in peace with
us. We call upon (the world) to help us in regaining our rights in a peaceful
way. But if that is not possible, we shall not accept the (Israeli) occupation
of our land,&quot; Sheikh Yassin told reporters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Speaking from his wheelchair, the Palestinian leader said
that &quot;the halt of military attacks (against Israel) is linked with
the departure of the occupation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Hamas leader said that his movement will not allow
any differences in the relationship with the Palestinian Authority to turn
into a confrontation between the two sides. &quot;The PA is part of the
Palestinian people. We shall remain in one trench,&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>		&quot;We tell the Israeli Prime Minister that power will
not last on his side. The weak will not remain weak. He [Netanyahu] has
to read history and look into the future. They [Israelis] have to recognize
our rights in our homeland. The future is for our and their children,&quot;
Sheikh Yassin told a crowd of Jordanian and foreign reporters a few minutes
before he boarded a military helicopter headed back to the Gaza Strip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Asked his opinion on the Jordanian government decision
to release the two Mossad agents who were involved in the assassination
attempt against Mr. Misha'al, Sheikh Yassin declined to comment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Director of King Hussein Medical Centre, Maj. Gen.
Adel Shraideh said that Sheikh Yassin would be accompanied by two physiotherapists,
who will give more treatment and who will remain in the Gaza Strip for a
few weeks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Gen. Shraideh added that Jordanian doctors had performed
surgery in the Sheikh's left eye and that his health was good. He added
that Sheikh Yassin was provided with a &quot;hearing device&quot; to improve
his hearing ability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Sheikh Yassin received a hero's welcome upon his arrival
in Gaza. Several thousand Hamas activists as well as senior PA officials
took part in the rally. He was then taken into the Gaza stadium where he
addressed the crowd of over 30,000 Palestinians celebrating his return to
his homeland.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Once there, Sheikh Yassin called for unity among Palestinians
and for all Palestinian factions to work for the release of the 3,500 Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;I call on our strong people to stand as one body,
with no difference between left and right, large and small,&quot; the Sheikh
said to the crowd, who interrupted him several times with &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;
(God is Great).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;We are all one people and we will remain so despite
the attempt of our enemies [to divide us],&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;On this day, Hamas represents a blow against the
security of Israel. We will continue our holy struggle until Palestine is
liberated,&quot; Gazan Hamas leader Abdul Aziz Rantisi told the crowd.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At the stadium entrance, Hamas military wing, the Izzedin
Qasam Brigades, stretched a banner which read &quot;We renew our oath and
loyalty to the holy warrior Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Once at the stadium, Sheikh Yassin had to be lifted up
in his wheelchair by bodyguards to wade through the crowds to the stage.
 After the rally, hundreds of Hamas activists gathered near Sheikh Yassin's
one-storey residence in the Sabra Quarter, and many of them lined up to
kiss the Sheikh's cheeks and receive his blessing.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Zionist President grants amnesty to Jewish
murderers</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Israeli
president Ezer Weisman has decided to grant amnesty to several Jewish terrorists
and convicted murderers, ostensibly to appease right-wing extremists who
were dismayed by the freeing on 1 October of Hamas founder and spiritual
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to Israeli sources, Weisman decided to issue
a &igrave;full pardon&icirc; for two Israeli Jews convicted of murdering
Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A spokesman for the Israeli president said Weisman pardoned
murderer Zeiv Wolf and Girshon Irchcovitc who in 1992 tossed a grenade into
a crowded East Jerusalem market, killing a 72-year-old Palestinian merchant,
Abdul Razzak Idkedek.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Moreover, the two Kahane Hay terrorists had carried out
a number of terrorist attacks on defenseless Palestinians in Hebron and
Jerusalem&iacute;s old town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A third terrorist belonging to the same cell had earlier
been released, also by a presidential decree.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In addition to pardoning the two terrorist murderers,
Weisman also decided to reduce the sentence terms of three other Jewish
murderers convicted of killing Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The three murderers include Yoram Skolnick who in 1993
murdered a Palestinian, Musa Abu Sabha, at  the village of Yatta near Hebron
while the latter was in fetters; and Nir Afroni who murdered a Palestinian
gas station worker in Jerusalem; and Nahshon Wolf who killed an Arab woman
near the settlement of Kiryat Arba&iacute;a near Hebron in 1991.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Observers point out that pardoning Jewish murderers of
Palestinians is an &igrave;established tradition&icirc; in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Haim Herzog, the former Israeli president who died earlier
this year, pardoned more than 10 Israeli terrorists convicted of murdering
Palestinians including two students at the University of Hebron in 1983.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Five Israeli soldiers try sadistic urges
on a Palestinian worker</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - Five Israeli
soldiers on 18 October attacked and nearly murdered a Palestinian labourer
near an Israeli army roadblock in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The worker, Ahmed Shaker Shakarneh, from the village of
Nahaline near Bethlehem, said he regained consciousness at the Jerusalem
Hadassa hospital after sustaining serious head wounds resulting from what
he called &igrave;sadistic torture&icirc; at the hands of five Israeli soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Thursday 16 October, a Beitshemesh police officer entrusted
the five border policemen to take Shakarneh to the closest Israeli army
roadblock along the Green Line.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Instead, the five soldiers took the Palestinian labourer,
who had been collecting medicinal herbs from the mountainous terrain nearby,
to a remote and uninhabited spot where they &igrave;started a party of beating
and of torturing.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;They started beating with their fists and kicking
me with their army boots until I nearly lost consciousness. Then they started
hurling stones at my head from a short distance, causing a big bleeding,&icirc;
Shakarneh said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Then one of them opened up my mouth and put lots
of dirt in it, while the other four were laughing hysterically.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shakarneh said he then was able to walk to the main street,
200 metres away, where he found an Arab driver who drove him to hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources stress that acts of savagery by Israeli
soldiers against Palestinian labourers are daily occurrences and that most
of the time they pass unnoticed by the world because they happen out of
sight of the media.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli landmines kill children in Palestine
and Lebanon</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	International charters mean little to a poor shepherd
boy in a remote area of the West Bank, unless that boy happens to step on
a buried landmine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Thirteen-year-old Jibreel Adra was tending his sheep two
years ago when he stepped on an Israeli landmine and lost parts of both
feet.   He knows nothing about the promise of Clinton to ban the use of
&quot;Anti-personnel Mines&quot; (APMs) or the subsequent refusal to carry
through with that promise by the American president in September.  However,
it will be a lasting memory in the minds of millions of people who feel
that Clinton again proved that he is more concerned with his relations with
the U.S. military-industrial complex than he is with the welfare of innocent
children like Jibreel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Tens of thousands of civilians suffer injury and death
every year from APMs, though they are less and less strategic in their use
as effective military devices.  According to the United Nations Development
Programme's &quot;Human Development Report, 1994&quot;, 90% of all war casualties
at the beginning of the century were combatants.  Now, 90% of war victims
are civilians, and landmines play an important role in generating that ugly
figure. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the Middle East, landmines continue to take a deadly
toll on innocent civilians. In Lebanon, there are an estimated 200,000 landmines
of American, Russian, Israeli and Chinese origin, either left over from
the civil war, or as part of the ongoing war in the south.  Since 1991,
landmines have killed 189 people, and another 212 have been injured. The
worst concentration is in the western Bekka region, the scene of many battles
between Syrian and Israeli forces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ten-year-old Hassan Mardini was out with his father hunting
for birds in an area populated by the Druze people in the mountains over
Beirut when he stepped on a landmine.  He lost his right leg and was eventually
treated in the U.S. and fit with an artificial limb all with the help of
an American relief group called the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In Palestine, every week or so an Arab civilian is injured
by a landmine, either an old one remaining from the Jordanian army that
had been in the West Bank until June 1967, or an Israeli device used as
part of a protection of their bases or settlements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Jibreel Adra was merely tending sheep in an area that
was used by the Israeli military when he stepped on an APM.  &quot;Something
exploded at my feet and I fell to the ground,&quot; recalls the boy from
Yatta, a village near Hebron in the West Bank.  He is currently in Chicago
for surgery courtesy of the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.  The APM took
parts of both feet and the boy now faces several painful surgeries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestinian Jibreel Adra and Lebanese Hassan Mardini are
lucky to be alive.  Most children who step on landmines are killed, as they
are often too young to lose the amount of blood that landmines take from
children.  Dozens of other Arab children who have stepped on APMs in Lebanon
and Palestine are not as lucky.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In an effort to lessen the burden of their forces occupying
south Lebanon, the Israelis have planted thousands of landmines on Lebanese
soil. Quite frequently, the victims of these landmines are not Lebanese
resistance fighters, but rather civilians who happen to wander in harm's
way.  The Israelis clearly are not interested in seeing a ban on the use
of APMs, as it is an important part of their &quot;defense&quot; strategy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In May, U.S. President Clinton announced that he was &quot;launching
an international effort to ban anti-personnel landmines.&quot; A few months
later, as that ban was close to becoming a reality, the U.S. vetoed a resolution
that would have eliminated these deadly devices from the face of the earth.
For the Arab civilian populations who are the victims of Israeli aggression
in Lebanon and Palestine, the APMs are just another weapon used to subjugate
their efforts to be free from occupation. Eliminating the APMs under the
soil may reduce the number of innocent Arab victims, but it will not remove
the source of the problem in the Middle East, which is the Israeli refusal
to acknowledge the rights of the Palestinian and Lebanese people to live
in freedom and with their own legitimate government.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas accuses Rabbis of misleading Ulama</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has accused Israel's
High Rabbinate of misleading Muslim Ulama (religious scholars) by urging
them to issue fatwas or religious edicts against Palestinian Islamists'
human-bomb attacks on Israeli targets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The rabbis are being morally selective; they want
our Ulama to condemn violence against Israelis without committing themselves
to do likewise vis-&brvbar;-vis Israeli-Jewish violence and terrorism against
our civilians,&quot; said Hamas Gaza leader, Dr. Abdulaziz al Rantisi.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 14 October, Hamas mentor and spiritual leader Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin received Rabbi Menhame Froman of the settlement of Tekoa near
Bethlehem who reportedly sought to hand him a letter from Chief Sephardi
Rabbi Bakshi-Doron asking Yassin to denounce violence.  Yassin refused to
accept the letter, saying its proper address is Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The letter read &quot;we have to do whatever we can to
stop violence and the only way to do that is through dialogue.  I am hopeful
that Sheikh Yassin can solve this problem. I call on him as a believer in
God.&quot; The letter, however, made no mention of the Israeli occupation
of Arab-Muslim land or of the daily torment meted out on the Palestinians
by the Israeli army and settlers. Yassin told Froman that Hamas would agree
to a cease-fire if Israel agreed to pull out of the occupied territories.
Rantisi, considered a hard-liner within Hamas, said he was disquieted by
&quot;the moral inconsistency of Jewish religious leaders.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 	&quot;We never hear them condemn the barbaric acts of
the Israeli army in the West Bank. Their silence is very frustrating and
doesn't augur well for future contacts between them and us,&quot; he said.
Rantisi added that it would be very unlikely that Rabbi Bakshi-Doron or
other rabbis would succeed in obtaining fatwas from the Sheikh of al Azhar
repudiating Palestinian resistance against oppression and occupation. &quot;Jihad
against oppression and injustice is well-established in the Qur'an, and
nobody can undo this,&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bakshi-Doron announced on 14 October that the Sheikh of
al Azhar, Sheikh Sayed Tantawi, had sent him a letter denouncing &quot;religiously-motivated
terror.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, a spokesman for Tantawi was reported as saying
that &quot;the Sheikh's remarks were distorted and taken out of context.&quot;
 Moreover, the spokesman said the Israeli ambassador to Egypt, Zvi Mazal,
omitted &quot;all remarks (made by Tantawi) pertaining to the Israeli occupation
and its causative relation to all forms of Palestinian resistance.&quot;

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Zionists destroy more Palestinian homes</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  In a flagrant measure that flies in the face of the Palestinian
Authority and the international community, the Israeli army destroyed two
more Palestinian homes at the village of Beit Ummar near Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two houses, belonging to Mahmud Abu Dayya and his son
Khaled, were destroyed by the Israeli army on 14 October under the pretext
that they were built without proper licensing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian eyewitnesses said the Israeli army declared
the vicinity where the two homes are located a closed military zone before
bulldozers began to pulverize them in the full view of crying women and
children who have been made homeless thanks to the callous Israeli act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mahmud abu Dayya, distraught by the demolition of his home
which sheltered his family of 9 children, said the Israelis &quot;were behaving
no different than the Nazis...the only difference is the name,&quot; he
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Asked why he had not obtained a building license, abu Dayya
said &quot;I tried to obtain a license a hundred times and every time I
went to the Building and Zoning office I was told I couldn't get a license.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources at Beit Ummar also revealed that the
Israeli army is planning to destroy the homes of as many as 30 Palestinian
families for alleged licensing violations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians and human rights activists contend that the
Israeli policy of home-demolition is considered by far the most callous
and evil manifestations of the Israeli occupation of Arab land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, Hamas mentor and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin cited &quot;home-demolition&quot; as one of the chief factors behind
Palestinian Islamists' martyrdom operations against Jewish targets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yassin said Hamas would reconsider attacks on civilian
Jewish targets if and when Israel desisted from assaulting Palestinian civilian
targets, including home demolition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
urged, though half-heartedly, Israel to &quot;stop unilateral acts&quot;,
a reference to, inter alia, demolishing Arab homes in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Haifa</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - An official at Al Aqsa
Society for Islamic Awqaf and Holy Places submitted a complaint to the Israeli
police in Haifa last month concerning Israeli desecration of Al Qassam graveyard
which contains the tomb of Sheikh Ezzul Deen Al Qassam, leader of the Palestinian
Revolution in the 1930s. Director of the Society, Mr. Nouril-Deen Midlej
said he was surprised to see that the fence his Society built round the
graveyard just two weeks earlier was damaged. He added that destroying and
removing the fence requires many hours. He wondered how the police that
patrol the place every half-hour did not notice the sabotage in progress.</FONT></P>

in Israeli jails an agony</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus (West Bank)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- The head
of the Palestinian Prisoner's Friends Society, Ahmad Habibullah, described
visiting the Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails by their
families as a journey of agony highlighted by a painful scene of children
and the aged waiting at the jails' gates. Mr. Habibullah said he met with
scores of detainees' relatives outside Shatta jail where he listened to
and experienced their sufferings during their visit to the jail.  He added
that he was touched by one young girl, Du&iacute;aa, the daughter of Palestinian
detainee Mohammed Abed Rabbu of Sur Baher (near Occupied Jerusalem), when
she started crying outside the jail and saying &quot;I want to see dad&Ouml;
I want to see him and kiss him.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian official pointed out that the families
of the detainees suffer from difficulties and constraints on getting permits
to visit their detainees. They are also forced to wait for long hours outside
the jails until they are allowed to go in but not without the humiliating
inspection measures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Habibullah added that when they are allowed in after all
their tiring efforts, they are given only a short visit.</FONT></P>

area</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron- Palestinian sources said that last month Israel
was continuing its settlement activities in the Hebron area south of the
West Bank. They pointed out that about 1,150 dunams of Palestinian land
were confiscated last month as part of a plan to confiscate more than 20,000
dunams in the same area over the next six months. The landlords of the confiscated
land submitted complaints to an Israeli court, which ordered them to introduce
documents proving their ownership of the land.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>110 Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon </FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Israeli
military sources said 110 Israeli army officers and soldiers have been killed
in attacks by the Lebanese Islamic militants in South Lebanon since 1985.
They pointed out that 37 of them have been killed since the beginning of
this year alone. The sources said the toll does not include 73 army soldiers
who were killed last February in a crash north of Occupied Palestine between
two Israeli helicopters that were in their way to implement a special operation
in South Lebanon. The last two months are considered the worst in the history
of the Israeli army since its 1985 retreat to the so-called buffer zone
in South Lebanon as far as the death toll is concerned, the sources said.
They explained that last September was a &quot;black&quot; month, especially
for the occupation troops in South Lebanon since as many as 17 soldiers
were killed by the Lebanese resistance groups.</FONT></P>

Cause</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Dhabi</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- A Palestinian official
said the unprecedented rates of confiscation of Palestinian lands in the
Occupied Territories by Israel seriously threaten the future of the peace
in the Middle East. The PA's Minister of Housing Abdel Rahman Hamad told
the UAE's Ittihad Arabic daily that the confiscation of lands that has increased
since the coming to power of Prime Minister Netanyahu in June 1996 does
not only threaten to sabotage the peace process only but also to liquidate
the Palestinian Cause which is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He
added that the Israeli occupation authorities have confiscated about 192,000
dunams of Palestinian lands in the West Bank during this year alone compared
to 30,000 dunams that have been confiscated annually since the Madrid Conference
in 1991.</FONT></P>

Islamic and national activists in the Occupied Jerusalem issued a statement
on the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the Israeli massacre against Muslims
in Al Aqsa Mosque in which 20 Palestinians were killed and scores were injured
inside the holy mosque on 8 October 1990. &quot;The massacre was another
evidence that the Islamic holy places have been scenes of massacres by the
Occupation authorities. Another horrible massacre was committed by an Israeli
soldier in Al Ibrahimi Mosque of Hebron four years later killing 29 and
injuring about 150 Palestinians while they were praying,&quot; said the
statement.</FONT></P>

to release 2 aged prisoners</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- The Palestinian
International Solidarity for Human Rights (ISHR) called on the Israeli occupation
authorities to release two detainees, a Palestinian and an Egyptian, after
spending more than 20 years in Israeli jails. Lawyer Fares Abu Hassan of
the ISHR said Mohammed Nu'erat, 60, a Palestinian from Maithalon located
north of the West Bank, has been detained for more than 23 years and suffers
from back pain and loss of memory. He was sentenced by a military court
to life imprisonment on charges of belonging to a PLO military group. Abu
Hassan added that Mahmoud Sawarkeh, 67, is an Egyptian soldier who was arrested
by the Israeli authorities in 1977 and sentenced to four consecutive life
imprisonments. &igrave;Sawarkeh suffers from various diseases especially
in the stomach,&icirc; Abu Hassan said, adding that the release of Sheikh
Ahmad Yassin should open the door for the release of the aged and ailing
Palestinian and Arab prisoners.<BR>
