<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#0000FF">Barak and Netanyahu: Tweedledum and Tweedledee</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;If only the mean-looking extremist Benyamin Netanyahu would
disappear and the moderate, peace-loving Ehud Barak would step in, Israelis and
Palestinians would live like brothers ever-after, and violence and bloodshed would be
things of the past.&#148; Such is the naïve dream of many people around the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But this is only a dream, even a problematic one, that is often a
product or byproduct of ignorance and naïvete, and perhaps some pristine good-will as
well. The fact of the matter, however, is that there are no fundamental differences of
note between the centre-left Labor Party and the right-wing Likud on matters of substance
pertaining to the Palestinian issue in general and Palestinian rights in particular.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, one can safely say that the often sleek tone of the Labor Party
<i>vis-à-vis</i> the Palestinians and the peace process in general disguises the same
expansionistic and domineering attitudes that more or less characterize the Likud.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the Labor Party, after all, that first practiced ethnic cleansing
in Palestine in 1948, pushing the bulk of the Arab population of mandatory Palestine to
flee for their lives. Moreover, historical Labor leaders, such as Ben Gurion and Golda
Meir, made no secret of their negation of the very existence of a people called &#147;the
Palestinians&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even Yitzhak Rabin, the so-called &#147;peace-maker&#148; (actually the
breaker of Palestinian children&#146;s bones), only begrudgingly agreed to come to terms
with &#147;the Palestinian problem&#148;, worrying that Israel would lose its Jewish
majority if the West Bank and Gaza Strip were to be annexed by Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And Peres, &#147;Mr. Peace&#148;, as Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat
flattered him recently, does not hesitate to unashamedly declare that &#147;it is not the
real or imagined Palestinian rights and grievances that prompted us to sign the Oslo
Accords but rather our anxiety about the future perils a bi-communal State would pose for
us.&#148; Peres, who perpetrated the Qana massacre in the spring of 1996 without having
the guts to say &#147;sorry&#148;, ostensibly believed more in &#147;Israeli
hegemony&#148; and the &#147;New Middle East&#148; (supposedly where Israel would pay the
central role) than in true peace with the Palestinians whereby the root causes of the
Arab-Israeli strife are addressed and treated, away from the colossal deception known as
the peace process, whereby a vanquished PLO is cajoled and wheedled into selling out
Palestinian rights to true freedom, homeland, Statehood and self-determination.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And now enters Mr. Barak, the former Israeli Chief of Staff, who often
speaks Netanyahu&#146;s mind without using his words. He is winning over the minds and
hearts of many world leaders, including, presumably, the American administration and
leaders of the European Union, and last but not the least, the autocratic Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, causing him to postpone the declaration of Palestinian Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But Barak is not Mr. Peace, even by his former mentor&#146;s
(Rabin&#146;s) standards. It is imperative that we remember that Barak opposed the Oslo
Accords when he was Chief of Staff under Rabin, arguing that the Palestinians &#147;got
too much&#148; and Israeli security and interests were seriously compromised. When he
became Foreign Minister for a brief period after Shimon Peres became acting Prime Minister
following Rabin&#146;s assassination, Barak demonstrated a combination of arrogance and
insolence in dealing with the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He called a group of Arabian Gulf dignitaries and officials whom he met
during a visit to Manama in March of 1996 &#147;a bunch of white robes&#148;. And although
he later apologized for the racist slur, saying it was &#147;a slip of the tongue&#148;,
he continued to harbor a patronizing political speech <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Palestinians
in general and the PA in particular, despite the latter&#146;s submissive concessions to
the Jewish State.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the difference between the Labor Party and the Likud resembles the
difference between ordering an Arab home demolished without prior warning (Likud) and
ordering it destroyed with an apology (Labor), for this is how the difference between the
two parties can be broken down, the difference between Netanyahu and Barak doesn&#146;t
exceed modalities and public relations postures. In fact, the political stances of both on
the final status settlement with the Palestinians are so similar that it is really hard to
find even one truly genuine difference between the two. The following demonstrate some of
the sweeping similarities between their respective stances on the West Bank and other
pertinent issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both Barak and Netanyahu vehemently reject any return to the borders of
1967. Both absolutely reject Israeli withdrawal from East Jerusalem, which they call
&#147;Israel&#146;s eternal and undivided capital&#148;. Both reject the vacating, let
alone the dismantling, of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. And Both
reject any meaningful return of the Palestinian refugees, now dispersed throughout the
four corners of the world, to their former towns and villages. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be made clear that the above-mentioned list of &#147;Nos&#148;
are not election campaign gimmicks on Barak&#146;s part. They represent the long-standing
position of the Labor Party, which explains why the aforesaid issues were categorized as
&#147;final status issues&#148;. Obviously, this meant, as Yossi Belin, a co-engineer of
the Oslo Accords, admitted on many occasions, that there would have been no agreement and
no &#145;Oslo accords&#146; had the Palestinians recognized that these were &#147;vital
red lines&#148; for the Jewish State. And red lines they continue to be, and even more so
with Barak than with the relatively dovish Belin.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bottom line of all of this is very simple: nobody should think that
a great breakthrough in the peace process would be made if and when Ehud Barak became
Prime Minister of Israel. </p>
