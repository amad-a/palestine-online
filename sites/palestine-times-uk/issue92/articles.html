<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The PA clamps down on free press</font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Khalid Amayreh</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Occupied Jerusalem- </b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After signing the hapless Wye memorandum on 23 October, the Palestinian
Authority (PA) stepped up its suppression of the media on the pretext of &#147;honouring
our international commitments&#148; and &#147;combating incitement&#148;. PA President
Yasser Arafat, who spoke almost euphorically about the &#147;historic agreement&#148;
after he returned from Washington, warned that &#147;we will not allow anybody or any
group to sabotage this great national achievement.&#148; PA Chief Ghazi al Jabali, an
Arafat hanger-on reputed for ordering night raids on Islamist-run colleges and
universities, stated that &#147;Israel was our enemy before the signing at Wye Plantation.
Now this has changed. Israel has become our peace partner and we shall not allow anyone to
incite or instigate against our partner.&#148; Jabali went on to describe the United
States as &#147;our friend&#148;, warning that whoever sets the American flag on fire
&#147;is a traitor.&#148;<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(54,205) (108,230) {Arafat} {Times New Roman} 10 B #ffff00 CT 0  " src="arafat.gif" alt="arafat.jpg (25753 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" u-originalsrc="arafat.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_arafat.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The campaign against the press began in earnest even before the return of
the Palestinian delegation from the United States. Thus on 23 October, agents of the <i>Mukhabarat</i>
(General Intelligence [GI]) raided the home of Hamed al Beitawi, whisking the high-ranking
judge of the Shariah court in Nablus from his home to solitary confinement in a prison on
the town&#146;s western outskirts. Al Beitawi&#146;s &#147;crime&#148; had taken place on
a satellite TV station called al-Jazira, based in Qatar, whereby he criticized the Wye
agreement as &#147;a sell-out, placing the Palestinian society under CIA supervision in
the service of Israeli security whims and demands.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, some PA officials even publicly lashed out at the
al-Jazira television station for &#147;allowing the opposition to besmirch the agreement
and vilify the Palestinian Authority.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The onslaught on the press continued unabated, with the detention and
harassment a week later of 11 journalists and cameramen for &#147;interviewing an
objectionable person without first receiving official permission.&#148; That person was
Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who had lambasted the PA for signing &#147;this
submissive document.&#148; When all efforts to silence the wheel-chair bound founder of
Hamas failed, the PA decided to place him under house arrest, severing his telephone line
and barring him from receiving visitors and performing prayers at his neighbourhood
mosque. The house arrest, said Ghazi Jabali, was aimed at &#147;protecting the Palestinian
people and Yassin himself from his own evils.&#148; Yasser Arafat, however, as well as his
obsequious secretary, Tayeb Abdul Rahim, argued on several occasions that Yassin&#146;s
arrest was for his own protection, hinting that Israeli agents were planning to kill him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mendacity became apparent on 23 December, when Arafat canceled the
arrest as &#147;a gesture of good will&#148; on the advent of the holy month of Ramadan.
The real reason, however, was not because of Ramadan nor benevolence on Arafat&#146;s
part. It was the Chairman&#146;s displeasure with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu, who, by that time, had unilaterally suspended, some say terminated, the Wye
agreement.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ministry of Information remains silent</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout all of the above, the PA&#146;s Ministry of Information, headed
by Yasser Abed Rabbu (head of the small pro-Oslo Feda Party), remained largely silent. Its
private whispers on behalf of the journalists fell on deaf ears in the security agencies
and met with further rebuffs in the General Information Department (GID), a new
security-oriented body which was set up to deal with journalists. The GID had issued a
decree on 5 November requiring that all foreign journalists obtain a special permit before
entering the self-rule areas. Strangely enough, the Ministry of Information denied that
such a decision had ever been made.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA harassment of the press was flagrant from the start of
Clinton&#146;s visit through the Anglo-American bombing of Iraq (16-19 December). When
demonstrations broke out, the PA did not want the world to witness the torching of
American flags. Several officials unashamedly claimed that &#147;the United States has
become the Palestinians&#146; best friend.&#148; In fact, one PA security official warned
that &#147;whoever sets the American flag on fire undermines Palestinian national
interests.&#148; Jabali stated &#147;that only traitors would demonstrate against the
United States.&#148; On 18 December, he ordered his men to brutally attack a group of
journalists covering an anti-American demonstration in downtown Gaza. According to Najib
Abu al-Jabin, who works for the Associated Press, the police &#147;attacked, beat and
dragged us to the local lock-up where drug addicts and other common criminals were being
kept.&#148; Zakariya Talamas, who heads the Gaza chapter of the Palestinian journalists
union, was also beaten up and briefly detained. He was quoted by the Gaza-based weekly <i>al
Risala </i>as saying &#147;I&#146;m very sad to say that the law of the jungle prevails
here.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to abusing and maltreating journalists, PA police also shut
down several press offices, accusing the proprietors of &#147;covering illegal
demonstrations&#148; and &#147;endangering relations with a friendly country.&#148; Abdul
Salam Abu Askar, one of those whose office was closed, testified as follows: &#147;Several
secret police agents besieged my office after midnight and asked me if I had disseminated
films of the protests. Before I could answer, they dragged me to the police station where
I found eight other photojournalists whose cameras, film and pictures had all been
confiscated.&#148; Abu Askar went on to say, &#147;There I met Colonel Talal Abu Zeid,
head of the Investigation Department, who demanded that I refrain from disseminating any
press materials undermining the PA&#146;s image.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the same time, PA police on direct orders from GI Chief Tawfik Tirawi
briefly shut down eight private television and radio stations operating in the West Bank
for &#147;over-covering anti-American demonstrations.&#148; Included were &#147;TV
Bethlehem&#148; and &#147;TV al-Watan&#148; in Ramallah, whose audiences exceed those of
the official PA TV station. As for those stations which it allowed to remain open, the PA
told them to confine their coverage to &#147;local news&#148; or &#147;face the
consequences&#148;, an indirect order to exercise &#147;self-censorship&#148; on
everything that it broadcasts on their screens.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Suppressed freedom of the press widespread</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fettering of press freedom was not confined to foreign correspondents
stationed in the autonomous enclaves or Palestinian journalists and cameramen working for
foreign-based news media. Even PA radio and television, which are virtual mouthpieces of
the PA autocratic regime, bore some of the brunt. Following the signing of the Wye River
agreement, the editors-in-chief of the three Palestinian dailies published in the occupied
territories&#151;<i>al-Quds, al-Hayatul Jadida </i>and<i> al-Ayyam</i>&#151;received
&#147;instructions&#148; from Yasser Arafat's office to &#147;scale-down their criticisms
of Israel and to use a milder language when referring to Jewish settlers.&#148; This
invitation to self-censorship prompted Hafez al Barghouthi, editor of the Ramalla-based <i>al-Hayatul
Jadida</i>, to declare in a rather satirical manner that &#147;he whose mouth is full of
water can&#146;t speak.&#148; In another instance, the three papers refused to publish
articles critical of the Wye memorandum, especially with regard to its security aspects,
including the stipulated CIA supervision of Palestinian media and civilian institutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the papers, however, sought to circumvent censorship by publishing
articles with academic overtones, criticizing, though indirectly and politely, the
Palestinian leadership&#146;s &#147;modest negotiating performance.&#148; But even this
half-hearted effort was the exception rather than the norm, and it often came &#147;too
little, too late.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA suppression of press freedom does not stem entirely from Israeli
pressure or CIA &#147;recommendations.&#148; Some of the severest forms of censorship are
reserved for criticism of Yasser Arafat himself and his administrative blemishes and
financial mismanagement. Arafat, it is well known, is effectively the sole leader of the
PA. Some say he is the PA. He holds all the reins, he controls all the money and he takes
all the decisions. However, despite his absolute power and authority, the Palestinian
media are not allowed to direct any criticism to his person, either implicitly or
explicitly. &#147;The President is above criticism&#148;, said Husam Khader, a maverick
Fatah Legislative Council member, who repeatedly demanded that all PA officials (including
Arafat) be accountable to the people, but to no avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides Arafat, there are a whole list of subjects considered off-limits
to the media, including security collaboration between PA and Israel, Arafat&#146;s wife
(Suha), Arafat&#146;s secret bank accounts and the extra-ordinary financial dealings
involving Arafat&#146;s financial advisor, Muhammed Rashid, and shadowy Israeli firms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When some of these &#147;red lines&#148; are crossed in Legislative
Council debates, PA intelligence and Preventive Security agents make sure that the dirty
clothing does not find its way to the newspapers or to private television stations. (Last
year the PA closed down an educational television station for screening a debate session
of the Council critical of the autonomous Authority.)</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Freedom prevails</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, in the age of the Internet and satellite televisions,
there is no hiding dirty laundry. At most, the PA can try to intimidate journalists and
foster an atmosphere of terror, but it is swimming against the current. The PA seems
almost certainly set to lose the race&#151;the free word will find a way. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Third or the Fourth Way!</font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Analysis of Mr. Munir Shafiq&#146;s Critique of Edward Said&#146;s Third
Way</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><b>By Dr. Musil J. Shihadeh*</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One cannot deny that Mr. Said&#146;s &#147;new&#148; approach of the
&#147;Third Way&#148; will obviate any further armed resistance to Israeli desperate
practices to keep its unlimited hegemony over the Palestinians&#146; national rights, as
rightly pointed out by Mr. Munir Shafiq. Using the examples of Algiers and Vietnam would
not cater to Mr. Said&#146;s thesis since the negotiations here followed a very bloody
path that convinced the oppressors that continuing with the ugly status quo could not
continue against the determined masses to regain their freedom. Therefore one has to
conclude that such a phase of negotiations could not be actuated until the oppressor
realizes that it would be a practice in futility to continue his colonialist ambitions of
keeping his hegemony over the determined oppressed. So the final negotiation is an
inevitable conclusion for a successful armed resistance, and this is not the issue, as
much as whether the oppressor has realized that it has no other alternative but to cede to
the will of the determined masses. The present &#147;peace&#148; negotiations proves
conclusively that the time is not right, as the Israeli oppressors are dictating their
humiliating terms for the total Palestinian surrender. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a well-known historical fact that political struggle will not
achieve any tangible proximate goals of its own unless it is backed by armed struggle. As
a matter of fact, and especially in our case, political struggle would carry no weight
unless it plays the role of the public relations forum for armed struggle. Just as the
miserable status quo of negotiations has proven, Mr. Shafiq would easily solicit my
approval that the &#147;Third Way&#148; proposals by Mr. Said is nothing more than an
illusion that stems out of a desperate attempt to find a solution, any solution. At the
same time, I cannot perceive Mr. Shafiq&#146;s thesis as a perfect approach to the present
dilemma when we realize that one cannot hope to achieve certain national objectives
without the active help and participation of certain factions on the other side. One
cannot ignore the fact that many Israelis have &#147;switched&#148; their position to
support the national rights of the Palestinians as a result of determined armed struggle.
Notwithstanding, there are many Israelis who did support, and still do, the Palestinian
national rights out of moral and ideological considerations. Many of them even support
armed struggle, while others tend to use it to justify their supporting views. It is for
this reason one does not have to choose between supporting those ideas of Mr. E. Said or
those of Mr. M. Shafiq, as the issue is not exactly black and white. Being relatively
weaker militarily than the other side, we should welcome any help that could emerge from
any faction of Israeli society, as long as such help would not impose any pre-conditions
on our armed struggle, strategies and final objectives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But before we even delve into the means, we still have to define our
objectives. Different factions of the Palestinian leadership tend to have different
objectives, leading to the perplexity of the path and the further confusion of our masses.
There are those leaders who have become pragmatic to demand the establishment of a
Palestinian State within the area of the West Bank with over 170 Jewish settlements
littering the Palestinian landscape, while some are a bit extremist to demand the pre-1967
borders void of all Jewish settlements. There are, of course, those who are demanding the
exact reversal to the situation before 1948, comprised of a Moslem government that gives
certain rights to the Jewish and Christian minorities. There are the &#147;utopians&#148;
who are proposing the earlier models of a secular democratic State for all Jews, Moslems
and Christians, or one State with bi-national composites. Surprisingly, very few are
entertaining the prospect of demanding the implementation of UN resolution 181/11 of 29
November 1947, known as the UN Partition Plan. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If total justice is to be achieved, then one has to envisage an armed
struggle that could go on for hundreds of years without guarantee of success, and which
might annihilate our people in the process. Theoretical justice, legality and morality
would necessitate the eviction of all Jews whose incursion into Palestine from the
beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century has resulted in the dispossession of our people.
Pragmatism, provided it is not used as a euphemism for further concessions, could also be
contemplated to get out of the vicious circle as a possible solution to the conflict. A
solution based on the semi-legal UN Partition resolution 181 of 1947 would be an ideal
path since it would legitimize our struggle in the eyes of the world, which has adopted
such a resolution in the first place. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to inform the reader that resolution 181gives us a lot more than
what it ostensibly purports. According to this resolution, it is prohibited to practice
eviction, or land and property expropriation by any authority against anybody Jewish or
Palestinian. This means that no one would have to become a refugee or lose his land or
property, which would not allow the Jews to possess more than 7% of the total area of
Palestine. Is this pragmatic or would it ever be acceptable to the Zionists? Of course
not, but it beats the allegation that a one-State solution is tantamount to the
&#147;destruction&#148; of Israel, as we would be talking from a legal base established by
the UN. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, 23 October 1998, it was reported
that over 400,000 Russian NON-JEWS have immigrated permanently to Israel abusing the Law
of Return, aside from using the same Law to admit hundreds of thousands of Jews from all
over the world. This should unveil the fact that even within Israel proper, there is
enough room to allow a good number of the Palestinian refugees to return. If we were to
implement the call for a one-State solution for all, then the status quo would definitely
make such a return an impossible venture, as it would not cater to the basic human and
civil rights of the Palestinians. Again, I am not advocating the goal of implementing
resolution 181 as much as I am trying to study our possible options and perhaps seek what
is a feasible solution. We have to stop seeking solutions that are based on theoretical
speculations that assume premises of morality, justice, logic and peace, as these are
terms that might mislead us. We should explore the available options with a pragmatic
approach that can solve the conflict with the least damage to our national aspirations and
with the least possible time, and without jeopardizing such dignified goals.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When such an objective is determined, then, and only then, can we go
forward toward seeking the proper vehicle to reach our goal, since the Zionists realize as
much as we do that the peace wagon would never arrive unless the Palestinians are on
board. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Since 1948 when the Jews first began their occupation of Palestine,
the world has looked with both sympathy and suspicion at the ensuing Arab/Israeli
conflict. The Jews were once seen by the world as a desperate people who were fleeing for
their lives from the brutalities of Hitler&#146;s holocaust. Beyond this, much of the
world has always suspected Zionist intentions. This suspicion is the result of the
propaganda and the sometimes brutal methods that the Jews have employed against the
indigenous Palestinian/Arab people of Palestine, who are the owners of the land upon which
the Jews sought shelter from their suffering at the hands of the Western world. The
Palestinian people have suffered as much as&#151;if not more than&#151;the Jews, who fled
Europe in search of a Jewish homeland and who proceeded to unleash upon their Arab hosts
the brutal reality of the Zionists&#146; dream for land. The United States, Israel&#146;s
primary patron, has stood guard against reason, accountability, justice and humanity to
accommodate the Zionist dream.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>This unquestionable and unconditional patronage is best witnessed
by American submission on the issue of Jerusalem and the final status negotiations of the
Oslo accords or the &#147;peace process&#148;.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>From presidential election to presidential election, the official
U.S. policy on Jerusalem has been that Jerusalem is an international city, a holy land
that has significance to the three world religions&#151;Christianity, Islam and
Judaism&#151;and that the final status must be settled through negotiations. With the
election of Bill Clinton as president, this official policy has changed.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Prior to Clinton&#146;s tenure in the White House, every American
President from 1967 until 1994 viewed continued settlement activity in Jerusalem
unfavourably. It was standard U.S. policy that settlements were illegal and a violation of
the Fourth Geneva Convention. Settlements in Jerusalem were considered unilateral actions
prejudicial to the determination of Jerusalem&#146;s final status and an &#147;obstacle to
the success of the negotiations for a just and final peace between Israel and its
neighbours.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>In 1979, the first Security Council resolution to specifically
address the issue of settlement construction was resolution 446. The United States and
Britain abstained from voting. On 20 July 1979, in resolution 452, the United Nations
called for an end to Israeli settlement building and again the United States abstained,
even though the U.S. representative to the United Nations condemned settlement building as
inconsistent with international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention. In March 1980, the
United States voted to pass UN Security Council resolution 465, which called on Israel to
&#147;dismantle existing settlements and in particular to cease, on an urgent basis, the
establishment, construction and planning of settlements.&#148; Later the American
ambassador to the United Nations in reference to the vote said, &#147;there are a number
of factors of a practical character that make impractical the call... some projects are
not so easily dismantled.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>We are now faced with a project that cannot easily be dismantled
and an Israeli Government that is determined to make dismantlement impossible by
continuing to build settlements for Jews only on occupied Palestinian land.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>In 985 AC (before Christ), according to an article by Patrick
Cockburn of the British newspaper <i>The Independent</i>, Arab geographer Muhammad Ibn
Ahmad al-Maqdisi wrote that Jerusalem was a &#147;golden basin full of scorpions&#148;.
Patrick Cockburn adds that it has not changed.</p>

<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>There is congruity in the process of Judaizing Jerusalem. Between
Israeli escalation and American capitulation, one can see that the Israeli Government, led
by hard-liner Benyamin Netanyahu, can issue orders to Judaize the city and uproot its Arab
Christian and Islamic historic features. This is met in Washington with a type of
coordination and facilitation that goes beyond defending Israeli policies. In Jerusalem,
Israeli authorities carry out their Judaization schemes and impose a status quo by force
of arms, while totally disregarding the resolutions condemning such acts that have been
consistently voted for by all of the countries of the world, except the United States.
Israel&#146;s friends and supporters in the U.S. Congress and in the media play out their
roles in this synchronized dance of deception by stepping mindlessly to the melody of an
arrogant and ethnocentric Israeli Jerusalem policy.<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(7,135) (197,160) {Jewish settlement in Jerusalem} {Times New Roman} 10 B #ff0000 CT 0  " src="jerus-settlement.gif" alt="jerus-settlement.jpg (14734 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="205" height="160" u-originalsrc="jerus-settlement.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_jerus-settlement.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>It is sad to see a once proud and respected American people
dominated and misdirected by the prodigal child, Israel. Israel&#146;s continued
settlement building in East Jerusalem, at a time when the United States claims to be keen
on the peace process, is an inexcusable act of disrespect toward one of its few
international friends.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>While Netanyahu&#146;s Government was being condemned by the Arab
world and the entire international community for non-compliance with the so-called peace
process, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, in a joint press conference held on 11
April 1997, told Israeli Defense Minister Mordechai that he was asking Congress for $1.8
billion dollars in grants to fund Israeli military programmes, which are supposed to
guarantee that Israel retains its &#147;qualitative&#148; edge over all Arab countries in
the region. During his lobbying efforts, Cohen justified granting Israel the money by
describing Israel as &#147;the oasis of democracy in this otherwise unstable region&#148;,
and as &#147;the United States&#146; longtime ally&#148;. Israel is the only so-called
democracy in the world that uses race and ethnicity to distinguish among its citizens.
Cohen further insulted the sensitivities of the world community by saying, &#147;We
(America) are firmly committed to its security and prosperity.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Muslims and Arabs heard these U.S. statements, and, having
witnessed America&#146;s complacent actions, have begun to ask questions. One of these
questions is why Arab countries are still moving toward normalizing relations with Israel?
Another question being asked is what does it mean when the United States rigidly opposes
every UN resolution that condemns Israel? On the public level, Washington expresses
distaste for Israel&#146;s settlement policies in East Jerusalem. Yet after repeated U.S.
vetoes in the United Nations that seek to block any international consensus on chastising
and forcing Israel to come into compliance with international law, can Washington expect
that its claim to be an &#147;honest broker&#148; of peace in the Middle East will be
accepted as credible? Should the Palestinians, who seem to have the sympathy of the
international community at large, continue to accept Washington&#146;s grossly biased
&#147;processes&#148;? To do so means that we have accepted the same failed logic that
forced the Palestinians to sit down alone with the Israelis, who clearly have the upper
hand in every way and who believe that negotiating with the Palestinians means dictating
to them. They negotiate peace while their bulldozers destroy the homes of the people who
own the land, simply because they are not Jews. America, the superpower, then casts its
looming shadow over the truth, demanding that the world remain silent and submit to this
illusion and ignore the ugly reality.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>This is the American role, though it has not been explained this
way to the American people by the Zionist officials in the State Department or by
Congressional supporters of Zionism. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>To fully understand the U.S. position on Jerusalem, it is necessary
to reflect on the history of the U.S. Jerusalem policy over time. There has always been a
clear American bias toward Israel and acceptance of Israel&#146;s strategic plan to
Judaize the Holy City of Jerusalem. In his article, <i>Jerusalem: In Search of Common
Ground</i>, Stephen S. Rosenfeld acknowledges that Israel has indeed been changing facts
on the ground in Jerusalem as part of a strategy designed, in Mr. Rosenfeld&#146;s words,
to &#147;deny long-resident Arabs their right to live in Israeli-annexed East
Jerusalem.&#148; Mr. Rosenfeld then identifies this strategy as &#147;creating
facts&#148;. He explains it thus: &#147;Of all the facts that Israel has created, none is
at once more prized, but also more provocative, than the dominant position Israel has
carved out since the 1967 war. Thus allowing it to take Arab East Jerusalem, annex it to
Jewish West Jerusalem, greatly expand its boundaries and settle it thickly, too. The
Israeli Government now treats the city as its exclusive, eternal, indivisible and
non-negotiable capital, and denies Palestinian territorial and national claims to any part
of it.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem&#146;s Legal Status and American Policy</b><br>
Since the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, Zionist theorists have been asserting to Jews all
over the world that one of the primary goals of Zionism is to establish Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel. When the Palestinian dilemma was handed over to the United Nations in
1947, following the termination of the League of Nations Mandate, Jerusalem was already a
major concern. According to the UN Partition Plan outlined in resolution 181, which was
issued in November 1947, Jerusalem was to be internationalized because it was agreed that
this was the best way to defend all of the religious interests present in the Holy City.
When the1948 war broke out, Israeli forces pushed toward Jerusalem and were able to
fulfill half of the Zionist dream by occupying 66.2% of Jerusalem and the surrounding
areas. While the Old City and its holy sites remained in the hands of the Arabs, Israel
announced that the land it occupied&#151;West Jerusalem&#151;would be its capital, and the
eastern part was then annexed by Jordan. The international community did not recognize
West Jerusalem as Israel&#146;s capital. The international community also refused to
recognize a similar Jordanian declaration on East Jerusalem issued in 1960. The United
Nations continued to affirm the need to implement resolution 181 regarding the
internationalization of Jerusalem. The United States refused to recognize Jerusalem as
Israel&#146;s capital and maintained its initial stand in support of internationalization.
But the U.S. view on internationalization did not last long. The Truman administration
soon opposed internationalization for domestic political reasons. The official
justification was impracticality, since there could be no executive power able to impose
internationali-zation. In 1953, Israel moved most of its Foreign Ministry from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem. Eisenhower saw this as a provocation that flew in the face of international
consensus. Eisenhower promptly ordered his Embassy staff in Tel Aviv not to recognize the
move. A year and a half later, the U.S. ambassador offered his credentials in Jerusalem,
and that was the end of the Eisenhower policy. Officially, however, the U.S. remained in
support of internationalization from 1948 to 1967, although the political rhetoric was
chaotic and dependent on the mood of the consecutive presidents and their respective
secretaries of State. Simply put, U.S. policy moved from openly supporting the UN
resolution that called for an international Jerusalem until 1967, when Washington started
working against it. That was the year Israel defeated the Arabs and occupied what was left
of Jerusalem.<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Promised Land of Broken Promises </font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Ramzy Baroud</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the debate continues... Is there such a thing as the &#147;Promised
Land&#148;? If there is, then what are its borders, to whom was it promised and why? As
most of us already know, Zionist philosophy has used the biblical statement in Genesis
(15:18) in which God promised to give His seed the land between the Nile in Egypt to the
Euphrates to support their political claims to the &#147;Promised Land&#148;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Assuming that the Bible is a reliable source for political allegation,
Zionist philosophy regarding the &#147;Promised Land&#148; fails to address other biblical
statements made by &#147;God&#148; regarding the same issue. For instance, in Genesis
21:13, &#147;God&#148; names Ishmael as His seed. Agreeing to that fact makes Ishmael the
father of Arabs. &#147;God&#148; makes it clear, then, that Arabs are part of the promise.
In addition, Galatians 3:27-29 clearly implies that all the believers in Christ
&#147;automatically&#148; are the seed of Abraham. After this long cycle of biblical
promises, Ephesians 2:12 excludes the Jews from the promise, because those without the
belief in Christ are strangers. If this set of promises confuses you, you are not alone.
Many more are still confused, even if some do not admit it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead of arguing for or against these biblical claims and statements
(which will always isolate and anger certain groups), I have decided to take another
route. I am going to assume that God has given his promise exclusively to the Jews. If
this promise was delivered in a godly fashion, let it be. If not, we have to deal with two
conclusions and choose that which we find fit. First, God has broken His promise, which in
itself is hard to accept as a characteristic of God. Or secondly, God has never promised
anything He could not fulfill to start with.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">David&#146;s unfulfilled promise</b></u><br>
In the middle of this century, David was given a promise. He was told that his
&#147;Promised Land&#148; was waiting for him to return. David was a German Jew who
suffered the consequences of the political turmoil in Europe during that time. After
suffering through much hardship for a few year, David&#146;s dream seemed closer to
reality that ever before. In no time, David arrived with his family, wife and three
children at an agricultural settlement. He was told, &#147;this is an empty desert and
it&#146;s our obligation &#145;as Jews&#146; to make it fit to be called the Promised
Land.&#148; Two years after his arrival, David found himself holding a rifle and chasing
Arabs out of their villages. In the beginning, David was not comfortable watching his
friends shooting defenseless and unarmed Arab peasants. Later on, David decided to do
whatever it took to clear the land from the &#147;Enemies of God&#148;. One day, David
found himself killing an Arab child in the arms of his mother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the conclusion of the &#147;cleansing&#148;, the &#147;Promised
Land&#148; was cleared of 418 Arab villages and towns, which were destroyed, and 13,000
Palestinian Arabs were massacred. Over a million Arabs were displaced around the world,
denied their human rights and dignity. Now, everything looks different. No more poor Arab
villages and suspicious faces. David is lying on his comfortable couch watching TV. A
picture of one of David&#146;s children stands on the shelf. His name is Dani, an army
officer in Hebron. Perhaps he is chasing little Arab kids with a more advanced rifle than
the one his father once had. Even though a much older David seems preoccupied with his
favourite programme on Israeli TV, a certain picture will never leave his mind. It is a
picture of an Arab woman, weeping and begging for his mercy to spare the life of her son.
David never listened to her that day and killed the boy. David looks around him, and with
shame he cries. Then he asks himself &#145;why didn&#146;t I go somewhere else, any place
else besides the &#147;Promised Land?&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Long Journey to Qundar</b></u><br>
Ishaq is an Ethiopian Jew. He lived in the Qundar region of Ethiopia most of his life.
Through the years, Ishaq made many friends in the area where he lived. His friendships
included Muslims and Christians. His best friend was Mohammed. Ishaq and Mohammed looked
alike. Some people thought they were brothers. In the early 1980s, some blonde-haired,
blue-eyed strangers were spotted in Ishaq&#146;s small and isolated town. After frequent
visits to the local leadership of the area, the strangers openly appealed to the people to
&#147;return home&#148;. Even though Qundar was the only home Ishaq knew, he was driven to
believe that he lived in exile, and the &#147;Promised Land&#148; (also known as Israel)
was where he and his people belonged. Even though Ishaq was never a practicing Jew, long
years of unemployment pushed him to seriously consider this new option. The youth of
Qundar, who never stopped talking about the blondes and the beaches of the &#147;Promised
Land&#148;, convinced Ishaq to search for the lost paradise. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The journey to &#147;Israel&#148; was full of danger and hardships. With
the help of some organized groups, Ishaq found his way to the Red Sea through Sudan, then
on to Israel where he arrived along with a large group of Ethiopian Jews also known as
&#147;Flasha&#148;. A few months after his arrival, Ishaq&#146;s family joined his quest
to the &#147;land of milk and honey&#148;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many years have passed since Ishaq and his family settled in the
low-income housing of one of the Israeli cities. So far, none of the promises made to
Ishaq have been delivered. Since he arrived in Israel, he has never had a stable job or a
reasonable income to make a living with dignity in an area where prices never go down.
Once a month, Ishaq stands in a long line of immigrants waiting for the Government&#146;s
assistance check. The worst part in that embarrassing moment is when the cashier throws
the check at him with disgust. Yet, Ishaq learned to live without complaining. As a
responsible Israeli citizen, Ishaq donated his blood once every few months. He was told
that if he does so, he might save the life of one Israeli soldier. A TV report was aired
some time ago showing that the donated blood of the Flasha found itself in the big
dumpster behind the blood bank. Some officials rushed to explain the conduct of the blood
centres, saying that the danger of the AIDS virus from blacks is much greater than other
races. Once again, with the same silent face, Ishaq shook his head with regret and said
nothing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For a while Ishaq had been lecturing his little children about his
&#147;Promised Land&#148;. However, the &#147;Promised Land&#148; he constantly talks
about is different from the one he was originally told about. Qundar is what Ishaq
believes to be his &#147;Promised Land&#148; and one day, he tells his family,
they&#146;ll return, regardless of all the danger and hardships. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Graveyards for Jews only</b></u><br>
It was difficult for Haeem and his family upon their arrival in Israel from the Soviet
Union. Even though they tried so hard, they didn&#146;t fit with Israeli society. Abraham,
Haeem&#146;s oldest son, missed being part of a group. Despite the fact that he knew
little to nothing about the politics of the region, Abraham joined the Israeli forces in
Occupied South Lebanon. Abraham&#146;s parents were filled with joy once they learned that
their son would take his place in defense of his land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last year, Abraham was killed in the fighting. Even though a great deal of
sadness was felt by the &#147;returned&#148; family, a greater sense of pride was felt.
With the blood of their son being shed for Israel, Haeem&#146;s family felt that their
quest for the &#147;Promised Land&#148; was complete. When Abraham&#146;s body was brought
back, neither official ceremony nor gunfire was heard anywhere around to honour the fallen
warrior. What was more devastating to the already saddened family was the refusal to bury
Abraham in a Jewish graveyard with religious ceremonies. Haeem was told that he
didn&#146;t complete all the steps needed to prove his family&#146;s Judaism. After days
of appeals and begging, Haeem was on his way, joined by his son&#146;s body and his
family, back to Russia. Russia was the place that Haeem chose to bury his son after the
long journey to escape Russia. While Haeem gazed from the window at the &#147;Land of
Israel&#148;, he didn&#146;t see the &#147;Promised Land&#148; of milk and honey. Instead,
he saw a heartless monster that no longer welcomed them and no longer cared. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Conclusion </b></u><br>
The stories of David, Ishaq and Haeem are true for so many promised Israelis. Once they
reached the end of an imaginary rainbow called the &#147;Promised Land&#148;, they found
nothing there except pain and regrets. Through the years, immigration to Israel was
accompanied by a reversed immigration from Israel. Those who remained had to deal with
many unanswered questions. In the end, some called on their government to come to terms
with reality so they could truly feel at home. Others chose to play the role of the
cowboys who chase behind Palestinian protesters (the Indians, in this case). With the
accumulation of years, however, a greater sense of loss, shallowness and regrets
intensified in the Israeli streets. In the midst of the madness, the two original
suggested conclusions push themselves to the surface once again. Did God fail those who He
granted (once upon a time) a promise? Or had He ever made promises to start with? For
some, at least for now, the questions might remain unanswered. For others, personal
beliefs or logic might be the judge to decide. For David, Ishaq, Haeem and others like
them, the question was answered a long time ago. For them, Diaspora truly started the
moment they left their respective homelands, be they Germany, Ethiopia, Russia and
elsewhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent collapse of the discredited Netanyahu Government ended yet
another dark chapter in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Like the ill-fated Oslo accords
that it loved to scorn, the Likud-led regime failed miserably to deliver the &#147;peace
and security&#148; it solemnly promised. If nothing else was achieved during his two and a
half years in office, Benyamin Netanyahu did eminently succeed in one respect&#151;that
being to reinforce Israel&#146;s dominance of the Palestinians and perpetuate their
historic suffering. <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(16,165) (118,190) {Netanyahu} {Times New Roman} 10 B #ffffff CT 0  " src="neten-kneset.gif" alt="neten-kneset.jpg (15910 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="132" height="185" u-originalsrc="neten-kneset.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_neten-kneset.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, when examined from a purely political point of view, it becomes all
too apparent that Netanyahu did, moreover, turn the clock of history back to the
deplorable status quo of 1989. For it was then that the Likud-Labour (Peres-Shamir)
coalition adopted a &#147;peace plan&#148; that the Bush administration ratified. The plan
stipulated that there would be no &#147;additional Palestinian State in the Gaza district
and in the areas between Israel and Jordan&#148; and &#147;no change in the status of
Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza, other than in accordance with the basic
guidelines of the [Israeli] Government.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Contrary to the official platitudes fed to the media that an independent
Palestinian State would pose a threat to Israel&#146;s security, the real concern across
the Israeli political divide has always been the supply of water. David Ben Gurion
recorded in his diary in December 1948 that &#147;an Arab State in Western Palestine [west
of the Jordan river] would be less dangerous than a State linked to Transjordan and maybe
tomorrow Iraq.&#148;<sup>1</sup> Today, Haim Gvirtzman, the country&#146;s leading
hydrologist, admits that the West Bank provides the largest and most important sources of
water for Israel. Hence, the creation of a Palestinian State is seen as an undesirable
obstacle between Israel and the acquisition of these vital resources. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a wider context, the American economic analyst Thomas Stauffer
estimates that 40% of Israel&#146;s water supplies are drawn from the territories, which
it occupied in 1967, and that it would cost the Jewish State more than $1 billion annually
if a peace settlement diverted these resources to their rightful owners in Lebanon, Syria,
Jordan and the West Bank.<sup>2</sup> Having resisted substantial pressure in this regard,
the Likud leader can justifiably claim that he did preserve Israel&#146;s hydraulic
interests in the occupied lands. Should any of his detractors attempt to brush aside this
achievement, Mr. Netanyahu can, as a face-saving device, boast that he did force the
President of the United States of America to fly into Gaza on board a helicopter and not
the Airforce One jet, as he originally planned, for the opening of the Arafat
International Airport!! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And so, even while remaining a hostage of the religious extremists, who
claim the West Bank as their God-given territories, Netanyahu still managed to placate a
significant section of Israel&#146;s secularists whose strategic objective is to merge the
West Bank and Israel physically and economically. Hence the reason settlement expansion in
the West Bank is increasing at a faster rate today than it ever did at any other time
since 1967. Anthony Coon, Head of the Centre for Planning at the University of Strathclyde
(Glasgow), has, significantly, noted that contrary to Israeli claims that the land used
for Jewish settlements are &#147;State land&#148;, more than 95% of it is actually
privately owned.<sup>3</sup> Throughout the occupation, successive Israeli regimes have
peddled the idea that since the settlements were built on &#147;State land&#148;, there
are no adverse effects on the Palestinians. Current realities categorically belie these
claims.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Cruel facts</b></u><br>
Access to water, more than its scarcity, still remains the greatest obstacle to the growth
of Palestinian agriculture. While agriculture accounts for nearly a third of the
Palestinian gross national product (GNP), irrigated agriculture constitutes less than 6%
of all Palestinian cultivated areas. As far as Israel is concerned, the supply of large
quantities of water has always been a major prerequisite for the success of its economic,
immigration and settlement objectives. Given this link between water, settlement and
economic growth, Israeli hydraulic consultants insist that whatever autonomy or
&#145;Statehood&#146; is granted to the Palestinians, it must effectively limit their
authority over the water in their own areas. In effect, the Palestinians must not be
allowed to develop any new agricultural areas because that would be to the detriment of
Israeli agriculture. After being bombarded with complaints for his handling of the 1998
water crisis, the best satisfaction Israel&#146;s water commissioner, Meir Ben Meir, had
to offer his Palestinian petitioners was a proposition that they should explore
desalinization!!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although Israel&#146;s stifling of the Palestinian agricultural sector is
central to the continued decline of living standards in the occupied territories, there
are, in addition, other contributory factors. These include the travel restrictions on
workers, absence of large-scale investments and falling wages. To make matters worse, the
occupying authorities have deliberately aggravated conditions in the territories by
denying licenses to factories and entrepreneurs in order to create a captive market for
Israeli manufactured goods.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The cycle of dependency and destitution generated by Israel&#146;s 30-year
occupation was not confined to Palestinian businesses and industry. Throughout the period,
an estimated 2,450 civilian homes were destroyed by the occupying power, leaving 10,450
Palestinian victims homeless. With unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza now standing at
an estimated 52%, more than half of the families there have been adversely affected. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">May 4<sup>th</sup> - a date with history? </b></u><br>
Of course, without American financial and diplomatic support, Israel could not have
engineered the gruesome facts as they now appear. Former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger explained exactly how this was achieved when he outlined the U.S. strategy in a
private meeting with Jewish leaders in 1975. He pointed out that it was based on a desire
&#147;to ensure that the Europeans and Japanese did not get involved in the diplomacy
concerning the Middle East&#148;, &#147;keep the Soviets out of the diplomatic
arena&#148;, &#147;isolate the Palestinians&#148; and &#147;break up the Arab united
front&#148;, thus allowing Israel to &#147;deal separately with each of its
neighbours.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although Kissinger did not remain long enough in office to oversee the
full enactment of his game plan, it nevertheless remained the cornerstone of American
policy in the region from Camp David right through Madrid until Wye. Israel&#146;s two
largest political parties&#151;Likud and Labour&#151;both found it agreeable and,
therefore, adopted it as a means to gradually extirpate the Palestinian national struggle.
Hence, they worked tenaciously with the Americans to forestall any effectual multilateral
negotiations on the Middle East, to undermine the Palestinian-Jordanian track, and more
recently to minimize completely Egyptian-Palestinian cooperation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clearly, if the attainment of peace remains dependent upon the present
U.S.-Israeli agenda, the region&#146;s people, particularly the Palestinians, would have
to wait much longer for the fulfillment of this dream. For despite the rhetoric about
being &#147;partners in peace&#148;, both the Likud and the Labour parties remain
vehemently opposed to any initiative that seeks to realize Palestinian aspirations,
notably that of independence and self-determination. Whereas the former openly displays
its preference for an apartheid-type settlement and additional &#147;transfers&#148;
(expulsion) of Palestinians, the latter, for purely diplomatic reasons, concedes to a
&#147;Palestinian State&#148;, albeit without the minimal attributes of independence. On
its part, the United States naturally favours the latter approach because even with such a
bastardized &#147;State&#148;, it would be much better placed to gloat before the
international community that it honestly brokered an historic compromise for world peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With Israel&#146;s general elections now scheduled for 17 May, political
observers are waiting to see whether Chairman Arafat sticks to his independence timetable
of 4 May or whether he bows to U.S.-Israeli pressure. For better or worse, what is perhaps
more important in strategic terms is the concern raised by several prominent Palestinian
analysts. That being whether the limited and cosmetic gains of an adulterated State is
worth the cost of unsettling the balance of power within the Palestinian and Arab ranks.
Here, the underlying argument remains that no historic settlement is worth the paper it is
written on if it seeks to deny Palestinian nationhood and humanity.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likely scenarios</b></u><br>
As the conflict overflows into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the prospects appear
increasingly ominous. Rising unemployment and economic bust in Israel will adversely
affect policies and relations with the Palestinians. While the settler entity will become
more desperate and determined to complete the economic integration of the West Bank and
Gaza, the Palestinians will, correspondingly, intensify their historic struggle for real
independence. The climate of unease and instability created by these two conflicting
aspirations will naturally deter foreign capital and investment because of the dangerous
risks of investing in a country that is at war with its neighbours and the people it
rules. The cruel facts created by Netanyahu all point in this direction. With unemployment
in Israel spiraling from1.5% in 1996 to 8.5% in 1998, the Jewish entity is becoming
increasingly in need of its low-intensity conflicts in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank
and Gaza to preoccupy its idle work force.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the Americans officially declared that the $1.2 billion promised
to Israel after Wye should be used only to disengage from the occupied territories,
present realities and past experience suggest that just the opposite is likely to occur.
Indeed, a precedent was already set in 1992 when Israel finally received the $10 billion
loan guarantees withheld during the last days of the Bush administration. Though intended
to facilitate the import of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, much of it was used
for infrastructural development and attracting business investment. Thus, the continuing
expansion of settlements, seizure of land, destruction of agricultural crops and growing
influx of extremist messianic sects in Jerusalem, will, altogether, fuel the conflict in
the run preceding the millennium. Worse still, with an impeached and crippled President in
the White House, there is very little that Palestinians can hope for from the present U.S.
administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The time has evidently come for a thorough rethinking of policy and
alliances. For what good is there in pursuing a policy shaped by a patron who issues
ultimatums and demands complicity from the victimized party? When every other agreement is
interpreted not as between governments or peoples but rather between individual political
leaders. When the bogeymen of &#147;security&#148; and &#147;terrorist
infrastructure&#148; are summoned conveniently to renege on political agreements. And when
security is not seen in the reciprocal context of rights and duties enjoyed and practiced
by &#147;partners in peace&#148;. Surely, there will neither be peace nor security while
the Palestinians are still looked upon as enemies and not interlocutors.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Israeli Myths</font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"></i><strong><em>By Dr. Musil J. Shihadeh*</em></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><b>(1-2)</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every country has its own myths, or stories that have no place in reality
but are used to propagate certain images that might misrepresent the facts and events that
have actually taken place. Of course the purpose is to create an unblemished picture of
the source, especially if involved in certain immoral or illegal acts, that might
compromise its image in the eyes of the world. Once the myth has served its purpose, it
was normal to discard it, lest researchers and independent observers might unveil its
falsehood. What makes Israel&#146;s myth a unique case is not its normal propagation of
the good image while hiding the evil, as much as such myths had become an integral part of
Israel&#146;s own history. Therefore, false information about the &#147;glorious&#148;
history of Israel has become the &#147;real&#148; history taught to the next Israeli
generation so as to instill false pride in all the history of the State. In other words,
the Zionists were so pleased with their unchallenged success in propagating these myths to
the Western world that they decided that such myths should also become an integral part of
Israel&#146;s own contemporary history. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have heard that if one repeats a certain lie so many times he would
start believing it himself. Why should the new Israeli generation be allowed to feel
ashamed of the inhuman acts of their forefathers in Palestine when the other alternative
is to aquire &#147;false&#148; pride in what the early Zionists have already achieved?
Since the whole world started to believe these myths, why not their own people? Talking to
many Israelis on this issue, I found out that many of them were not disingenuous about
believing these myths, because when presented with documented proof to the contrary, they
reluctantly accepted the new version of history, after passing through a transient
shocking experience. One has to recognize, though, that it would be very difficult for
anyone to change the attractive image of his forefathers from the courageous pioneers who
fought very hard to establish a &#147;legitimate and moral&#148; objective called Israel,
into the real grotesque and evil image of a group of bandits who were involved in the
immoral and cruel acts of the unjust uprooting of the indigenous Palestinians from the
lands they lived in since Biblical times. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Myths, therefore, were needed to justify the biggest land grab in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century and to dispel the justified grievances of the victims in the eyes of the world.
Myths were needed in this case to justify the forced evictions of the indigenous
Palestinians from their homes while replacing them with foreign entities swarming from all
parts of the world. Such Israeli myths sheltered many flagrant violations of international
laws embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Geneva Conventions and The Hague
Conference on human rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of these myths maintain that Palestine was the land without people
(no indigenous Palestinians) and should be given to the people (the Jews) without the land
or it was the Palestinians who sold their lands to the early Zionists and so they have no
legal claim to an already &#147;sold&#148; land. Another popular myth is that the small
Zionist forces were able to defeat the invading mighty Arab armies who started the war
against the &#147;peaceful&#148; Zionists on 15 May 1948 with huge armies that outnumbered
the Zionist forces at a ratio of 20 to 1, or the myth that purports that because the
Palestinians rejected the UN Partition on Palestine, it follows that they alone should
bear the horrible consequences of such rejection. Of course there were many other myths
about the wars of 1967 and 1973, but it would be appropriate to explore a few of these
myths so as to show that honesty was not exactly the preferred approach used by the
classical Israeli and Zionist historians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I do not need to elaborate on the first myth, as the facts later dropped
this myth from any serious consideration when over 800,000 Palestinians were evicted from
the land &#147;without people&#148; under the astounded eyes of the world! How could such
a huge number of people come out from the &#147;land without people&#148;? As to the lie
that the Palestinians have sold their lands myth, it is debunked forcefully by the
Israelis&#146; own sources when we realize that since the beginning of the century the
feverish campaign to buy land in Palestine by the Jewish Agency (JA), the Jewish National
Fund (JNF) and private sources has failed to purchase more than one-half per cent of the
land over a period of 50 years of continuous efforts. According to JNF sources, the
increase of Jewish ownership of land has only increased from 7% to 7% (discounting the
2% State land controlled by the British Mandate) <font SIZE="2"><b>(1)</b></font>. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This failure has been the rationale used by Menachim Begin to justify the
largest heinous massacre he perpetrated at Deir Yassin, and the secret instructions given
by Ben-Gurion to commanders in the field to execute the systematic expulsions of the
Palestinian civilians <font SIZE="2"><b>(2)</b></font>. It should be obvious to any
neutral observer that with the exuberant prices offered, it would be very hard to believe
that Palestinians would sell their land for such good prices only to end up living in the
sub-human conditions of the refugee camps <font SIZE="2"><b>(3).</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As to the claim that it was the huge Arab armies who invaded Israel
without any provocation on 15 May 1948 and Israel had &#147;no choice&#148; but to defend
itself against this &#147;aggression&#148;, it should not be hard to expose such a Zionist
claim for what it really is when we realize that by the time Israel declared its
&#147;Statehood&#148;, it already occupied almost 78% of Palestine and had evicted over
800,000 refugees while simultaneously demolishing their homes and villages in the process
to make sure they would never return or be repatriated. These events had taken place
before one single Arab soldier intervened in the conflict. Actually, such Israeli
systematic occupations and expulsions forced the Arab governments to react and intervene,
albeit a bit too late. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The major black &#147;hole&#148; in Israel&#146;s history is the period
from 29 November 1947 to 15 May 1948, when by sheer &#147;magic&#148; Israel expanded from
a 7% land control to 78% in less than 5 months! Even if one would probe into the
archives of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, such a period is missing from the
historical files! The claim that the Arab armies were outnumbering the Zionist forces at a
ratio of 20 to 1 is most ludicrous when we realize that the entire Arab armies did not
exceed 13,600 in number when compared to the well-equipped Zionist forces of
26,700&#151;almost 2 to 1, all right, but in favour of the Zionists! <font SIZE="2"><b>(4)</b></font>.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most malicious of these myths is the claim that had the Arabs in
general and the Palestinians in particular accepting the UN Partition resolution on
Palestine (resolution 181 of 29 November 1947). None of the tragedies we are facing today
would have ever taken place. Accordingly, expulsions then were not planned in conjunction
with Zionist propaganda, but were simply &#147;accidents&#148; of the 1948 war, or
exigencies of the conflict. Hence there would have been no refugees, no expropriation of
land, no violence, no wars, no victims and everybody would have coexisted harmoniously
ever since. This sounds like a very pleasant dream, but miles away from the real world of
international Zionist objectives, and much further from the real truth. Regrettably, many
Arab sources repeat such myths and assign the blame to the indigenous Palestinians for
rejecting the UN Partition Plan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Arab rejection of the UN Partition Plan of resolution 181/11 was
within the normal attitude of any people, as no one would cede more than half of his best
land to a foreign colonialist, who declared his intentions of evicting the indigenous
Palestinians once he established his presence. Actually, the Arab rejection of the UN
Partition was a Zionist blessing in disguise, because had the Arabs accepted the Partition
resolution, the Zionists would have to invent a new excuse to still uproot the
Palestinians and to expropriate their lands in the process. As I pointed out earlier, one
has to understand that since the advent of Zionism in the area and up to the date of the
Partition, the Zionists collectively could not own more than 7% of the land of Palestine,
including that land owned by the Jewish Agency (JA), the Jewish National Fund (JNF) and
the entire private Jewish sector. Let us remember here that the UN Partition, even though
it had allotted almost 55% of the best coastal areas in Palestine for the Zionists to
establish a Jewish State, strictly prohibited in either State any land expropriation or
the expulsion of anybody from his home or property. This meant that the Palestinians would
still own over 93% of Palestine and represent the majority of the population even within
the assigned Jewish State <font SIZE="2"><b>(5)</b></font>! And since according to the
same UN Partition, democratic process would be implemented with equality for all within
either State, the Arab Palestinians would control the majority in government
representation while owning most of the land in both States. Since the Zionist demand from
the UN that future immigration to the State be under their control was rejected by the
world organization, it became more than apparent that future Jewish immigration would be
decided by the majority Arab representative government and even if it was not, no one
could find a solution for future immigration of millions of Jews to a land that did not
comprise more than 7% of Palestine. Even if the State land (less than 2%) under the
British were turned over to the Zionists, it would still fail drastically to cater to a
small portion of the future needs of the Jewish State. Therefore, accepting the exact
implementation of the UN Partition resolution would have been an unwelcome disaster for
the Zionist leadership, and the so-called goal of a majority Jewish State to be
established would simply go down the drain! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In order, then, for the dream to come true, Arabs would have to be
expelled and their lands would have to be expropriated since the Jewish limited geographic
realities could hardly cater to the needs of the existing Jewish community in Palestine,
let alone when the future Jewish immigration would become the top urgent priority dream of
the future Jewish State. It was a declared and publicized objective of Zionism to create a
majority Jewish State in Palestine, which was drastically contravened by the facts on the
ground, and therefore the transfer (euphemism for expulsion) of the Arabs had to be
practiced to realize such goals. You cannot create a majority Jewish State as the declared
objective of international Zionism when the demographics and geographics favoured the Arab
majority owning 93% of the land and a marginal Arab majority of the population. The
Zionists knew this very well, and the transfer of the Arabs was not therefore a result of
the exigencies of the war, as falsely claimed by the Zionists, but rather a long sought
plan since the advent of this racist ideology, as noted by Theodore Herzl, who called for
the &#147;gentle&#148; transfer of the Arabs out of Palestine as early as the end of the
19<sup>th</sup> century and has been repeatedly advocated ever since <font SIZE="2"><b>(6).</b></font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anti-Jewish Persecutions</font></b><br>
During the whole period of classical Judaism, Jews were often subjected to persecutions-
and this fact now serves as the main &#145;argument&#146; of the apologists of the Jewish
religion with its anti-Gentile laws and especially of zionism. Of course, the Nazi
extermination of five to six million European Jews is supposed to be the crowning argument
in that line. We must therefore consider this phenomenon and its contemporary aspect. This
is particularly important in view of the fact that the descendants of the Jews of pre-1795
Poland (often called &#145;east-European Jews&#146;- as opposed to Jews from the German
cultural domain of the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, including the present Austria,
Bohemia and Moravia) now wield predominant political power in Israel as well as in the
Jewish communities in the USA and other English-speaking countries; and, because of their
particular past history, this mode of thinking is especially entrenched among them, much
more than among other Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We must, first, draw a sharp distinction between the persecutions of Jews
during the classical period on the one hand, and the Nazi extermination on the other. The
former were popular movements, coming from below; whereas the latter was inspired,
organized and carried out from above: indeed, by state officials. Such acts as the Nazi
state-organized extermination are relatively rare in human history, although other cases
do exist (the extermination of the Tasmanians and several other colonial peoples, for
example). Moreover, the Nazis intended to wipe out other peoples besides the Jews: Gypsies
were exterminated like Jews, and the extermination of Slavs was well under way, with the
systematic massacre of millions of civilians and prisoners of war. However, it is the
recurrent persecution of Jews in so many countries during the classical period which is
the model (and the excuse) for the zionist politicians in their persecutions of the
Palestinians, as well as the argument used by apologists of Judaism in general; and it is
this phenomenon which we consider now.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It must be pointed out that in all the worst anti-Jewish persecutions,
that is, where Jews were killed, the ruling elite- the emperor and the pope, the kings,
the higher aristocracy and the upper clergy, as well as the rich bourgeoisie in the
autonomous cities- were always on the side of the Jews. The latter&#146;s enemies belonged
to the more oppressed and exploited classes and those close to them in daily life and
interests, such as the friars of the mendicant orders. It is true that in most (but I
thank not in all) cases members of the elite defended the Jews neither out of
considerations of humanity nor because of sympathy to the Jews as such, but for the type
of reason used generally by rulers in justification of their interests- the fact that the
Jews were useful and profitable (to them), defence of &#145;law and order&#146;, hatred of
the lower classes and fear that anti-Jewish riots might develop into general popular
rebellion. Still, the fact remains that they did defend the Jews. For this reason all the
massacres of Jews during the classical period were part of a peasant rebellion or other
popular movements at times when the government was for some reason especially weak. This
is true even in the partly exceptional case of Tsarist Russia. The Tsarist government,
acting surreptitiously through its secret police, did promote pogroms; but it did so only
when it was particularly weak (after the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, and in the
period immediately before and after the 1905 revolution) and even then took care to
contain the breakdown of &#145;law and order&#146;. During the time of its greatest
strengthen- for example, under Nicholas I or in the latter part of the reign of Alexander
III, when the opposition had been smashed- pogroms were not tolerated by the Tsarist
regime, although <i>legal</i> discrimination against Jews was intensified.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The general rule can be observed in all the major massacres of Jews in
Christian Europe. During the first crusade, it was not the proper armies of the knights,
commanded by famous dukes and counts, which molested the Jews, but the spontaneous popular
hosts composed almost exclusively of peasants and paupers in the wake of Peter the Hermit.
In each city the bishop or the emperor&#146;s representative opposed them and tried, often
in vain, to protect the Jews. The anti-Jewish riots in England which accompanied the third
crusade were part of a popular movement directed also against royal officials, and some
rioters were punished by Richard I. The massacres of Jews during the outbreaks of the
Black Death occurred against the strict orders of the pope, the emperor, the bishops and
the German princes. In the free towns, for example in Strasbourg, they were usually
preceded by a local revolution in which the oligarchic town council, which protected the
Jews, was overthrown and replaced by a more popular one. The great 1391 massacres of Jews
in Spain took place under a feeble regency government and at a time when the papacy,
weakened by the Great Schism between competing popes, was unable to control the mendicant
friars.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps the most outstanding example in the great massacre of Jews during
the Chmielnicki revolt in the Ukraine (1648), which started as a mutiny of Cossack
officers but soon turned into a widespread popular movement of the oppressed serfs:
&#147;The unprivileged, the subjects, the Ukrainians, the Orthodox [persecuted by the
Polish Catholic church] were rising against their Catholic Polish masters, particularly
against their masters&#146; bailiffs, clergy and Jews. This <i>typical</i> peasant
uprising against extreme oppression, an uprising accompanied not only by massacres
committed by the rebels but also by even more horrible atrocities and
&#145;counter-terror&#146; of the Polish magnates&#146; private armies, has remained
emblazoned in the consciousness of east-European Jews to this very day- not, however, as a
peasant uprising, a revolt of the oppressed, of the real wretched of the earth, nor even
as a vengeance visited upon <i>all</i> the servants of the Polish nobility, but as an act
of gratuitous antisemitism directed against Jews as such. In fact, the voting of the
Ukrainian delegation at the UN and, more generally, Soviet policies on the Middle East,
are often &#145;explained&#146; in the Israeli press as &#145;a heritage of
Chmielnicki&#146; or of his &#145;descendants&#146;. </p>
<font FACE="B Palatino Bold"><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Modern Antisemitism</b></font><br>
The character of anti-Jewish persecutions underwent a radical change in modern times. With
the advent of the modern state, the abolition of serfdom and the achievement of minimal
individual rights, the special socio-economic function of the Jews necessarily disappears.
Along with it disappear also the powers of the Jewish community over its members;
individual Jews in growing numbers win the freedom to enter the general society of their
countries. Naturally, this transition aroused a violent reaction both on the part of Jews
(especially their rabbis) and of those elements in European society who opposed the open
society and for whom the whole process of liberation of the individual was anathema.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Modern antisemitism appears first in France and Germany, then in Russia,
after about 1870. Contrary to the prevalent opinion among Jewish socialists, I do not
believe that its beginnings or its subsequent development until the present day can be
ascribed to &#145;capitalism&#146;. On the contrary, in my opinion the successful
capitalists in all countries were on the whole remarkably free from antisemitism, and the
countries in which capitalism was established first and in its most extensive form- such
as England and Belgium- were also those where antisemitism was far less widespread than
elsewhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Early modern antisemitism (1880-1900) was a reaction of bewildered men,
who deeply hated modern society in all its aspects, both good and bad, and who were ardent
believers in the conspiracy theory of history. The Jews were cast in the role of scapegoat
for the breakup of the old society (which antisemitic nostalgia imagined as even more
closed and ordered than it had ever been in reality) and for all that was disturbing in
modern times. But right at the start the antisemites were faced with what was, for them, a
difficult problem: how to define this scapegoat, particularly in popular terms? What is to
be the supposed common denominator of the Jewish musician, banker, craftsman and beggar-
especially after the common religious features had largely dissolved, at least externally?
The &#145;theory&#146; of the Jewish race was the modern antisemitic answer to this
problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In contrast, the Old Christian, and even more so Muslim opposition to
classical Judaism was remarkably free from racism. No doubt this was to some extent a
consequence of the universal character of Christianity and Islam, as well as of their
original connection with Judaism. But in my opinion a far more important reason was the
social role of the Jews as an integral part of the upper classes. In many countries Jews
were treated as potential nobles and, upon conversion, were able immediately to intermarry
with the highest nobility. The nobility of 15<sup>th</sup> century Castile and Aragon or
the aristocracy of 18<sup>th</sup> century Poland- to take the two cases where
intermarriage with converted Jews was widespread- would hardly be likely to marry Spanish
peasants or Polish serfs, no matter how much praise the Gospel has for the poor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is the modern myth of the Jewish &#145;race&#146; &#150; of outwardly
hidden but supposedly dominant characteristic of &#145;the Jews&#146;, independent of
history, of social role, of anything- which is the formal and most important
distinguishing mark of modern antisemitism. This was in fact perceived by some Church
leaders when modern antisemitism first appeared as a movement of some strength. Some
French Catholic leaders, for example, opposed the new racist doctrine expounded by E.
Drumont, the first popular modern French antisemite and author of the notorious book <i>La
France Juive</i> (1886),,,, which achieved wide circulation. Early modern German
antisemites encountered similar opposition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It must be pointed out that some important groups of European
conservatives were quite prepared to play along with modern antisemitism and use it for
their own ends, and the antisemites were equally ready to use the conservatives when the
occasion offered itself, although at bottom there was little similarity between the two
parties. &#145;The victims who were most harshly treated [by the pen of the
above-mentioned Drumont] were not the Rothschilds but the great nobles who courted them.
Drumont did not spare the Royal Family&#133; or the bishops, or for that matter the
Pope.&#146; Nevertheless, many of the French great nobles, bishops and conservatives
generally were quite happy to use Drumont and antisemitism during the crisis of the
Dreyfus affair in an attempt to bring down the republican regime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The type of opportunistic alliance reappeared many times in various
European countries until the defeat of Nazism. The conservatives&#146; hatred of
radicalism and especially of all forms of socialism blinded many of them to the nature of
their political bedfellows. In many cases they were literally prepared to ally themselves
with the devil, forgetting the old saying that one needs a very long spoon to sup with
him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A sharp distinction must be made between conservatives and even
reactionaries on the one hand and actual racists and antisemites on the other. Modern
racism (of which antisemitism is part) although caused by specific social conditions,
becomes, when it gains strength, a force that in my opinion can only be described as
demonic. After coming to power, and for its duration, I believe it defies analysis by any
presently understood social theory or set of merely social observations- and in particular
by any known theory invoking interests, be they class or state interests, or other than
purely psychological &#145;interests&#146; of any entity that can be defined in the
present state of human knowledge. But this I do not mean that such forces are unknowable
in principle; on the contrary, one must hope that with the growth of human knowledge they
will come to be understood. But at present they are neither understood nor capable of
being rationally predicted- and this applies to all racism in all societies. As a matter
of fact, no political figure or group of nay political colour in any country had predicted
even vaguely the horrors of Nazism. Only artists and poets such as Heine were able to
glimpse some of what the future had in store. We do not know how they did it; and besides,
many of their other hunches were wrong.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Yemeni Hostage Drama Embroiling<br>
<i>Islam and British Muslims</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hundreds of foreigners have experienced involuntary &#147;tribal
hospitality&#148; in Yemen in the past couple of years. Neither hostages nor the countries
they came from seemed to complain or raise an objection until a completely different
not-so-hospitable kidnapping took place. Until Aden Islamic Army joined the club, hostages
had generally been treated well, overfed and eventually delivered safe and sound. Tribes
resorted to hostage-taking as a means of pressuring the Yemeni Government to provide
certain badly needed services, such as the opening of a clinic, the construction of a road
or the release of imprisoned chieftains embroiled in a mild dispute with the regime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Little attention had, until recently, been paid to the domestic crisis
Yemen had been living through as a result of a combination of factors, including rampant
corruption and autocracy. Visitors to Yemen, including many of the hostages themselves,
would tell you that it was dire poverty, desperation and frustration more than any thing
else that motivated most of these tribal kidnappings. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While it is not far-fetched to assume some foreign influence, it is the
Yemeni establishment which many Yemenis, as well as some foreign observers, now blame for
the lack of security and widespread agitation. Some people even go as far as attributing
the lack of decisive action to what they regard to be an unprecedented power struggle
alleged to be taking place among various wings within the ruling party.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The hostage-taking routine took a sharp turn, however, when the Yemeni
authorities decided to use force in order to free a group of tourists that were taken
hostage, this time not by a tribe but by a political group that until recently had been
unheard of to the outside world, but more importantly that had been on very good terms
with the regime in Sanaa. The perpetrators of this hijacking turned out to be remnants of
the Al-Jihad Group, ostensibly unconnected to the Al-Jihad of Egypt or Palestine, which
came into existence during the pre-unification era when Aden was the capital of the
pro-Soviet Socialist Republic of South Yemen. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The group emerged as a reaction to the radical secularization policies
adopted by the communist regime in the South. Under the leadership of Tariq Al-Fadli, the
group, many of whose members had been to Afghanistan where they received military training
and ideological indoctrination, joined the North Yemeni troops during the war of 1994,
which almost completely eradicated the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) that sought, but
failed, to undo the amicably accomplished unity between the two parts of the country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the war, the Yemeni Government, having prevailed throughout Yemen
and having weakened its foes and competitors, tried to find an acceptable solution to the
Al-Jihad group, which was credited with scoring victory in some of the fiercest fighting
between the troops of President Ali Abdallah Salih and those of the YSP. Al-Fadli and
several of his followers joined the ruling Congress Party and were assimilated. Others,
led by the current leader Zaynul-Abidin Al-Mihdar (also known as Abul-Hasan), turned down
offers of civilian posts and positions and insisted on being drafted into the military
establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Government refused to draft them into its military&#151;fearing
their potential influence on the rest of the army&#151;the group opened an unlicensed
military training camp in the province of Abyan, where most of the recruits came from. It
is rumoured in Yemen that there was an old score to be settled between this group and the
current Yemeni interior minister, Hasan Arab (who also comes from Abyan and who was once a
prominent figure in the YSP), that had complicated matters and led to the unwise and
widely condemned kidnapping of tourists. The interior minister pushed for a military
solution to the crisis although this is not the official policy sanctioned by the
President or his Prime Minister.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Soon after the conclusion of the kidnapping, it was revealed that a group
of British Muslims suspected of belonging to a London-based group known as the Supporters
of Shari'ah (SOS), which is led by an Egyptian said to be an Afghan war veteran, also
known as Abu Hamza (his real name is Mustafa Kamil), who had been detained by the Yemeni
authorities for allegedly having plotted to bomb a number of installations in Aden. It was
also revealed that the entire kidnapping was aimed at securing the release of members of
this group, whose leader (Abu Hamza) had issued a <i>fatwa</i> (an authoritative ruling on
a religious matter) legitimizing not only the use of force against the Yemeni Government
so as to topple the regime and be replaced by an &#145;Islamic&#146; one, but also the
killing of foreigners who failed to heed his advise of leaving Yemen immediately.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although Abu Hamza is a British national, having obtained this status upon
marrying a British lady in the late 1980s (whom he later divorced), he uses his North
London base at Finsbury Park Mosque to declare war against the entire world and justify
the killing of British tourists and expatriates working in Yemen. He had previously issued
statements supporting attacks against tourists in Egypt and the killing of civilians in
Algeria. His <i>fatwas</i> emanate from the ideology of <i>takfir</i>,<i> </i>according to
which all those who do not rule by Shari&#146;ah, as understood and interpreted by Abu
Hamza, are apostates and infidels who deserve to die, including all present Arab leaders
and politicians throughout the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Hamza&#146;s connection with the Yemeni hostage-takers has alarmed the
Muslim community in Britain, and more so the British authorities themselves. His
statements, including several TV and newspaper interviews and a recent press conference,
only confirm the fears of many leading personalities within the British Muslim community
that dubious fringe groups, such as SOS, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Al-Muhajeroon, and deviant
individuals, such as Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri, through the propagation of extreme ideas
and the instigation of violence render it hard for the Muslims in Britain to lead a
peaceful life in which they can contribute to the cause of Islam and to the well-being of
the Muslim community and of society as a whole.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only has the recent hostage drama in Yemen alerted observers to the
scandalous inability of the Yemeni Government to put an end to the kidnappings, which have
continued even after the murder of British tourists, but also alerted Muslims in Britain
to the failure of their organizations and scholars to play a positive role in countering
the influence of the <i>fatwas</i> issued by ill-informed, misguided people who lack
compassion, knowledge and wisdom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another source of anxiety has been the role played, or perhaps not played
at all, by the British authorities in connection with the activities of individuals such
as Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri. In flagrant violation of British law, the former has
expressed public support for the killing of British nationals in Yemen whereas the latter
had expressed public support for the bombings of Nairobi and Dar-us-Salaam and is alleged
to have once issued&#151;in public&#151;a death sentence against former Prime Minister
John Major. Many Muslims have misgivings about the attitude of the British authorities,
who seem to tolerate these particular individuals and the groups they lead while some
other Muslims who have not been proven guilty of any mischief have been arrested and
detained for indefinite periods of time under some vague security or immigration acts. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The question that is being raised is: Could it be that the harm caused to
Islam and the Muslims by Abu Hamza and his counterparts is something which certain circles
within the British official establishment would welcome? This is not a nave question.
Islam is now the fastest growing religion in the country and it gains more converts every
day. The population of Muslims is estimated at no less than ten times that of the highly
influential Jewish community in Britain. Is it not likely that by tolerating&#151;in the
name of democracy and freedom of expression&#151;people like Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri the
Government may be preparing the ground for denying democratic rights to the Muslim
community as a whole? Is it not possible that the long-term objective might be to curb the
spread of Islam and the growth of Islamic influence in British public life? Or else, who
is really reaping the fruits of the seeds sown by SOS and Al-Muhajeroon?</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Defeatism as a Psycho-political Disease</font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Dr. Ibrahim Alloush*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you go to the circus one day, you might see an elephant that is tied up
with a thin rope standing without complaint in one spot. Let&#146;s call this elephant
Abdo.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no question that Abdo the elephant has more than enough muscular
strength to break free not only of that rope, but of many more much thicker than it. But
this is not just any rope. No sir!! This is the same rope, or one that is very similar,
that Abdo used to be tied to when he was young and weak. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Over time, THE IDEA of that rope becomes in itself a deterrent.
Thereafter, the mere sight of it evokes surrender and immobilization. THE ROPE becomes
INTERNALIZED. Abdo has internalized his defeat (to use a term used by Adel Samara in his
pamphlet about political Islam). This internal rope turns into a psycho-political disease
when it impedes our ability as individuals and as a nation to move or make progress in our
lives due to the fear of failure or due to the lack of belief in one&#146;s own worth. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Too many of us think that symbolic or moral things in the conflict between
us and the Zionists are not important. But, in fact, we could learn from Abdo&#146;s rope
that nothing could be further from the truth. In the cold, hard, calculating heads of
military generals, it goes without saying that having the upper hand in morale, by shoring
up one&#146;s own and bringing down that of the enemy is just as important in ensuring
victory as having the upper hand in hardware, strategic planning, discipline or logistics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It follows that if the enemy could destroy your incentive and will to
resist to begin with, then that would make its job much easier. Sun Tzu said in his
ancient Chinese classic<i>, The Art of War</i>, &#147;To win without fighting is
best.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you believe that you are bound to lose because the enemy is superior
technologically, has spies everywhere, or just because you are addicted to defeat from
childhood, that would make the job of your enemy much easier, wouldn&#146;t it?!! Yet note
that even though we Arabs frequently think that way, and therefore remain under occupation
and/or dictatorships, the Chechnians, the Vietnamese, the Algerians and all those who
succeeded in liberating themselves (without necessarily succeeding in building a good
regime after liberation) could not have thought that way. Because as the oppressed, you
have to challenge the odds to make headway. And if you always play by the odds, YOU BECOME
A SLAVE OF THE STATUS QUO, which is built from your subjugation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You think recognizing &#147;Israel&#148; is just meaningless ink on paper?
Think again. For recognition means giving legitimacy. With legitimacy, our struggle
against what we recognize becomes automatically illegitimate. Politically, the RECOGNITION
BECOMES LIKE THE ROPE OF ABDO. It will be invoked against any Palestinian, Arab or Islamic
activist who struggles against Zionism and its State. The recognition itself emanates from
our psychological defeat as a nation and as activists, especially since it is being
extracted from us while we are at one of our weakest points.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We Arabs have vast human, economic and political resources that remain
untapped because we lack the collective will to fight. One of the reasons we lack the
collective will is the lack of leadership, like the kind Nasser used to provide. Another
is inside us: it is manifest in the disease of psycho-political defeat that most of us are
inflicted with to varying degrees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let&#146;s consciously and deliberately CONFRONT DEFEATISM INSIDE US with
the will to win: begin with challenging yourself and examining carefully all the political
justifications that were embedded in our consciousness to justify the infamous rope of
Abdo, previous failures included.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">International law: a Perspective on U.S. strikes
on Iraq </font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Hisham al-Zoubeir</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In mid-December, the United States of America, aided and supported by the
United Kingdom, launched strikes against Iraq in an operation called Desert Fox. It was
claimed by the U.S. and the U.K. to be a lawful use of force, despite the fact that the
three other permanent United Nations Security Council members condemned the strikes and
called a halt to the bombings. This was reiterated by many other nations around the world.
There have been many episodes in world history since the United Nations came into being
where the use of force was condemned and the nations involved subsequently denounced. In
some circumstances, this resulted in forceful action; Iraq was driven out of Kuwait during
the Gulf conflict. In other circumstances, this resulted in little more than international
condemnation. It may be argued that there is little point to identifying and debating
these issues, since it is well established that the law is only as effective as the power
that seeks to enforce it.<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(0,134) (137,171) {Iraqi victim of Anglo-
American missiles} {Times New Roman} 10 B #ffff00 CT 0  " src="iraq-victims2.gif" alt="iraq-victims2.jpg (22709 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" u-originalsrc="iraq-victims2.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_iraq-victims2.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If it were established that the United States had broken international
conventions on the use of force, the question of who would enforce the law on the
world&#146;s last real superpower would still remain. However, international law still
plays a significant role in the world today, and while it may be frustrating to know that
at times the legal reasoning may only be theoretical and not useful to any practical
extent, it is still necessary to ascertain international legal positions. For it is still
hoped that one day, all nations will be subject to the same just standards. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The use of force is legally justified in two other situations: (1) Actions
taken by the UN Security Council itself to maintain and/or restore international peace
and/or security, and (2) Self-defense, as stipulated by Article 51 of the UN Charter,
which states: &#147;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of
individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the
United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain
international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right
of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any
way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present
Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or
restore international peace and security.&#148; It is advisable to note that international
law recognizes only the right of the United Nations to exercise force under the first
case, and thus only the United Nations Security Council can declare such actions. Other
regional organizations, such as NATO, cannot. However, in the second case, no State is
obliged to wait for the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution in order to
defend itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What are the possible U.S.-British arguments? The U.S.-British air strike
can be argued in international law in a number of ways: (1) The U.S.-British alliance was
implementing UN resolutions as per the first justification for using force; (2) The U.S.
and the British were defending themselves from Iraq as per the first part of the second
justification for using force; or (3) The U.S. and the British were defending the rest of
the world from Iraq as per the second part of the second justification for using force. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first claim is dealt with quite simply. In order for the United States
and Britain to claim that it was acting on behalf of the United Nations to hold water,
they must demonstrate that they had UN approval for its actions. The question to ask is:
was it necessary for the UN Security Council to pass a resolution to grant Member States
permission to attack Iraq? Yes. Has there been such a resolution in recent history? Yes.
This resolution was passed in 1990, and authorized Member States to use &#147;all
necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 (1990) [this resolution dealt with
Iraq&#146;s invasion of Kuwait] and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore
international peace and security in the area.&#148; It remains to be seen whether or not
the coalition that went into the Gulf overstepped the doctrines of proportionality in
trying to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait. However, with the eviction of the forces, the
resolution was thus fulfilled and is now not relevant. In any event, this resolution was
nullified by resolution 687, which declared that a cease-fire was in place: &#147;upon
official notification by Iraq to the Secretary-General and to the Security Council of its
acceptance of the provisions above, a formal cease-fire is effective between Iraq and
Kuwait and the Member States cooperating with Kuwait in accordance with resolution 687
(1990).&#148; There were certain conditions laid out for Iraq to accept for this
resolution to be passed. The United States and the United Kingdom has declared that Iraq
has failed in its obligations as specified in this resolution and in later declarations.
Specifically, the U.S. and the U.K. have insisted that Iraq has made the job of UNSCOM
impossible. This bears close attention. In the UNSCOM report that apparently prompted
action by the U.S. and the U.K. against Iraq, it was claimed that there have been only
five obstructions. There have been 427 inspections in total. Two of these
&#145;obstructions&#146; were refusals to inspect two establishments on Fridays, which is
the Muslim day of congregation (comparable to the Christian Sunday and the Jewish
Saturday). The inspectors were told that since these establishments were closed, they
would have to be accompanied by Iraqi officials, in accordance with the Iraq-UNSCOM
agreement on Friday inspections. The remaining three &#145;obstructions&#146; were as
follows: (1) a 45-minute delay before allowing access;.(2) a refusal to allow inspectors
to interview all of the undergraduate students in Baghdad University&#146;s Science
Department; and (3) the refusal to allow the inspectors to inspect the tiny headquarters
of the Baathist political party. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, for the purposes of legal argument, we will take it as a given
that Iraq did indeed fail in its international obligations. If so, would the strikes have
been legally justified? The United Nations Security Council declared after the Gulf
conflict that it would &#147;take such further steps as may be required for the
implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security in the
area.&#148; According to this statement by the Security Council, it is obvious that any
use of force that claimed to act under the auspices of the United Nations for the purposes
of enforcing the above resolutions would have to first be authorized BY the Security
Council in a separate resolution, unless the doctrine of self-defense came into play. It
cannot thus be claimed by the U.S. or the U.K. that it acted in the name of the Security
Council, and thus not in the name of the United Nations. They were acting on their own,
without UN authorization. In that case, could the U.S. or the U.K. argue that it acted in
self-defense? If the U.S. and the U.K. were to argue this, they would have to prove that
Iraq had committed an armed attack against them. It is quite obvious that Iraq does not
even have the capability to launch any attacks against the U.S. or the U.K.; it is a
country crippled by sanctions that do not even allow pencils for fear the lead within them
can be used for weaponry. The Iraqi army consists of 275,000 men that seem to be
preoccupied with defending the dictatorship in Baghdad and keeping minorities in check
around the country. There is no air force. It is noted, however, that neither the U.S. nor
the U.K. has claimed the right of self-defense; if either had, this right would find no
support in international law. (For our American readers, please note that at the present
time, the United States of America is not at war with Iraq; war can only be declared by
the Congress as per the American Constitution [Professor Francis Boyle has elaborated what
U.S. constitutional law says on this issue].) </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the U.S. and the U.K. have often claimed that Iraq poses a
significant threat to its neighbours; they could have made a case that they were acting on
behalf of one of their allies. Then again, this argument would be hard to justify
considering nearly all of the countries in the region strongly opposed the strikes. The
Arab countries, the Muslim countries, China, Russia and even Kuwait seemed to distant
itself from the attacks. The Iranian nation, which has suffered most from Iraqi
aggression, condemned the bombings as &#147;colonialist aggression.&#148; Even chiefs of
staff of the State of Israel, which is often regarded by Iraq as its main enemy in the
region, stated that Iraq is a &#145;minimum risk&#146;. And as the International Court of
Justice in the Nicaragua case of 1986 established, States must ASK to be defended for
intervening States to claim the right of collective self-defense. However, in this day and
age, it is possible that non-neighbours may be at threat from a country by virtue of
long-range weapons. President Clinton of the U.S. spoke of &#145;weapons of mass
destruction&#146;, such as nuclear weapons and chemical weapons. The International Atomic
Energy Commission has declared that Iraq has zero nuclear capability. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly enough, the only nation in the world to have used nuclear
weapons is the same one that, according to press reports, keeps a stockpile of more than
10,000 of them&#151;the United States. According to press reports, Iraq&#146;s chemical
warfare was ironically produced by British and European technicians, with the full
knowledge of the U.S. in the past., since it was being used against Iran, the U.S. enemy
of the time. At present, however, the Iraqi regime does not have sufficient means to
deliver any chemical weapons, which leaves only one population really at risk&#151;the
Iraqis. (It is interesting to note that the weapons that the U.S. and the British
supported the buildup of at one time are now being used as excuses to bomb Iraq.) Hence,
it cannot be said that the U.S. or the U.K. had the legal right to strike Iraq. It must
also be said, however, that the suffering of the Iraqi people will continue until a free
and independent regime is established in Iraq, chosen by the people of Iraq, and without
external domination. The Iraqi people should not be ruled by a Western &#145;yes-man&#146;
anymore than they should be ruled by a barbarian dictator, and they should not be subject
to brutal regimes that are so extreme that they could be classified as causing genocide.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>By E. Yaghi</em></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My older stronger brother is called Cain. You might remember hearing about
him from eons past at a time when there was more good than evil in the world. My name is
Abel and this is my story.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am a 10-year-old Iraqi street boy. I make my living selling gum and
begging on the streets of Baghdad. Beggars do not do well these days as the majority of
the people are worse off than poor, they are desperate and have no where and no one to
turn to. Rumor has it that the smart and wealthy Iraqis have long ago fled the country,
leaving behind the ruins of a once great nation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before I was old enough to remember, the Americans bombed my country
during the war Westerners fondly labeled &quot;Desert Storm.&#148; This year, during the
Holy month of Ramadan and not too long before Christian Iraqis celebrated Christmas, the
Americans again bombed us. I am old enough now to remember how destructive and terrible
bombing is. Believe me, it is the worst form of terror and there is simply no refuge from
a bomb. Ask my father, for it was an American bomb that took his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I don&#146;t remember my father. He was killed during Desert Storm. He was
a professor of English Literature at the University of Baghdad and as my mother tells us,
used to quote Shakespeare, especially Macbeth, the eve all this madness began. But our
tomorrows and tomorrows and tomorrows have come and brought us nothing but death, disease
and despair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am considered one of the &#147;lucky ones.&#148; I have eaten enough
garbage and drunk enough sewage-polluted water to give me resistance to simple germs. You
see, children like me, 5,000 to 6,000 a month, die from a variety of ailments and only the
strongest survive. After all, we have neither medicine nor adequate health facilities to
treat animals, much less humans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes I feel I am not so lucky to be alive after all. I am forced to
spend most of my time out on the street begging for a few pennies that I take home to my
mother at the end of the day. It is winter and the wind on the streets of Baghdad goes
through my young bones. Other street boys like me, some of them orphans too, gather
together and build a bonfire to warm our hands and bodies. But nothing warms our hearts.
Our childhood is denied us. Everywhere I look, I see ragged mothers carrying ragged
starving sick babies with sores seeping all over on their tiny hands and faces and I
wonder if this is the way things are supposed to be. My older brother Cain says it is. He
says that might is right and that power once it falls into the hands of the wicked, knows
no justice and certainly no mercy. Cain should know for he has much experience in such
matters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I, like many Iraqi children my age, do not go to school. I stop cars and
try to beg a penny or two from drivers that look little better off than myself.
&#147;Please sir, have a penny to spare for a boy who has to support his family. My mother
is sick and unable to beg and my sister has diabetes.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes I feel a cold penny plunk into my frozen hand and if I am
terribly hungry, I take a few more pennies and try to buy a stale sandwich. You know the
kind, the bread that has little green spots growing all over it. But sometimes my stomach
hurts so bad from hunger pangs, I will eat nearly anything. Fasting teaches the full in
Ramadan really nothing like what the starving already know. And Cain tells me there are so
many full people in the world. Full, happy stomachs sitting around warm fireplaces. A
fireplace where children can dream of what new excitement tomorrow will bring. My
tomorrows have come and gone and I am only 10. My evenings are filled with nightmares and
I have come to determine that peaceful dreams are dreamt and owned only by the prosperous.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, there are almost daily clashes between American planes and
Iraqi forces. Each boom makes me shudder and my future is more uncertain than ever.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Cain is happier than I have ever seen him. Some inner sense of scenes
replayed an infinite number of times gives me the feeling that he is trying to kill me. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On a cold night while fellow street kids and me try to keep warm over a
few wooden matches, I just might welcome the vision of my father opening up his loving
arms, inviting me to a world where there are no Cains, no war, no hate.</p>

acts like, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright heartlessly placed the blame for the
latest American bombings of Iraqi residential districts in Basra on what she termed as
&#147;Saddam Hussein&#146;s lack of compliance with U.N. Security Council
resolutions.&#148; She further justified the continued American air strikes on Iraqi
territory by claiming that the Iraqi president was responsible for the deaths of thousands
of his own people and that after all, the U.S. government merely had the best interests of
the Iraqi people at heart by trying to oust their leader.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Her statements resemble the Arab proverb of the man who killed his friend
with a dagger and then not only attended his funeral but cried too. Whatever kind of
leader Saddam Hussein has or has not been does not give the Americans any right to bomb
the Iraqi people and retain the maintenance of the crippling sanctions that have been in
effect even before the commencement of the Gulf War in January of 1991.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On January 24, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al Sahhaf stormed
angrily out of a meeting of Arab ministers in Cairo because they failed to meet
Baghdad&#146;s call for a unilateral lifting of U.N. Sanctions. Baghdad wanted Arab
foreign ministers to defy the crippling sanctions and to condemn recent U.S. and British
air strikes on Iraq. But in their final statement, the foreign ministers did not call for
an immediate lifting of the sanctions nor did they condemn outright the U.S.-British
strikes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, the foreign ministers furthered angered Iraq by demanding an
Iraqi apology for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and by insisting that Iraq stop provoking
its neighbors. This apology was linked to future Arab efforts aimed at lifting the
embargo. In an attempt to compromise, the Iraqi Foreign Minister Sahhaf, offered to
apologize if some of the other Arab governments also apologized for their participation in
enabling U.S. and British planes to take off and land from their air bases. But the Iraqi
attempt met with deaf ears and heads filled with sawdust.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ms. Albright may stutter such meaningless statements as, &#147;We regret
the stray missile on Basra that killed several civilians,&#148; and &#147;The use of force
is not our preferred mechanism,&#148; what the Arab world does see is ruthless and
merciless aggression on an unarmed civilian population living on the brink of disaster.
Americans can arm-twist or bribe most Arab leaders into compliance with their air strikes
on Iraq, but the Arab masses are not sitting around their dinner tables with their pockets
lined with bribe money, nor do they believe the rubbish that American forces are in the
Gulf to protect the interests of Iraq&#146;s neighbors. American forces are in the Gulf to
protect their own interests. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Cold steely knives gleam under the lights of the surgical unit but they
just cannot kill the beast. Perhaps it is hard to define who or what the beast actually
is. Perhaps the beast lies in each one of us, for we are ultimately responsible for the
ongoing tragedy in Iraq and the blood of the innocents indelibly stains our hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Aisha Khan</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What should have been a holy month of peace and prayer was witness to some
of the worst aggression in recent years. Ramadan began with unilateral attacks against
Iraq and is now ending with genocide in Kosovo. Tens of thousands of people have already
fled their homes in Kosovo, but international opinion has still not come round to the fact
that immediate action is called for. The massacre of 45 Albanian civilians by the Serb
police in Racak village has only led to calls for an inquiry and investigation, despite
the fact that the United Nations monitoring mission has already visited the site and
confirmed the deaths. The U.S. and the United Kingdom&#151;trigger-happy when it came to
the question of Iraq&#151;have now left the solution to NATO, which, in turn, is content
with sending two generals to warn Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. There is no talk
of air strikes or other punitive action.<img src="kosovo-massacre.jpg" alt="kosovo-massacre.jpg (18903 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="170"></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The West&#146;s indifference to the happenings in Kosovo unmask their real
motives for intervention in Iraq. It is clear that all the talk of peace, security and
weapons of mass destruction only apply to theatres where it has an economic stake. Why
single out Saddam Hussein as a mass murderer? Is not Slobodan Milosevic as much of a
maniac with a comparable army and weapons of mass destruction at this command? Has he not
been systematically driving out and killing ethnic Albanians in Kosovo? But all this does
not seem to warrant any collective international intervention. At the most, NATO issues
impotent threats it has no intention of carrying out&#151;a fact which has emboldened
Serbia in its bid to wipe out the Albanians. The reason is clear: Saddam&#146;s adventure
in Kuwait threatened the oil interests of the United States. But there is no oil or other
precious mineral at stake in Kosovo. Only innocent lives, which do not count for anything
at all. As economic liberalization imposed by the West proves to be a failure, disgruntled
youth let off steam by targeting minorities, who are blamed for all their unfulfilled
aspirations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In India, the rise of the Hindu nationalists has a similar cause. Its
backbone is urban lower middle class youth, who want a better deal from life and who
easily lap up the myth that minorities are to blame for their fate. During the month of
December 1998, these Hindu nationalists created another huge ruckus over the activities of
Christian missionaries in some very backward, tribal areas of India. Fringe lunatic groups
belonging to the larger Hindu nationalist family, of which the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party is a member, attacked missionaries and burned churches. The date? Christmas Day. It
seems holy days are the best for aggression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For once, the focus of these right-wing nationalists has moved from their
favourite target&#151;Muslims&#151;to the smaller minority of Christians (under 2% of the
population). Many analysts believed that this may be linked to the fact that a certain
Roman Catholic (Mrs. Sonia Gandhi) heads the Congressional party, all set to take over
power from the Hindu nationalists whenever the next elections are held. What is
interesting in all this is the difference in general outrage and media coverage when it
comes to Christians versus Muslims. It is very sad that in a constitutionally secular
country that any minority is victimized, but it is even sadder that attacks on some
minorities attract so much attention while others seem to be routine and not worth
commenting on. Perhaps outrages against Muslims have become so common that there seems to
be nothing outrageous about it. It could also be that European and other Christian
countries, which are economically powerful, indeed, even the Vatican, immediately lodged
protests through their ambassadors against the attacks on Christians. On the other hand,
Muslim countries either are not overly concerned or do not have the necessary weight to
&#145;get away&#146; with the protests. In fact, some years ago after yet another communal
riot that targeted Muslims, the Moroccan ambassador lodged a protest with the foreign
ministry. Incensed, the Indian government had him declared <i>persona non grata</i> and
immediately expelled from the country. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Christian controversy has also raised another interesting issue: that
of the whole ethics and politics of conversions. The Hindu nationalists are furious that
the Christian missionaries use economic inducements to &#145;forcibly&#146; convert
illiterate tribal members living isolated lives in dense forests. If conversions happen
due to economic inducements, this says a lot about the kind of pathetic lives and grinding
poverty these tribal members face. If conversion to Christianity gives them access to
education, plots of land for farming, decent jobs for their children and some sense of
social dignity, then who can blame them for converting? Instead of crying foul, one
wonders why the Hindu Jagran Manch cannot go and do similar developmental work among these
people and make them convert to Hinduism. The fact is that these tribal members do not
really follow the Hindu religion as recognized by the rest of the country and are more
animistic in their faith than anything else. The truth is that till recently mainstream
Hindu organizations, or for that matter Muslim bodies, cared the least for tribal members,
who are generally looked at as backward savages. However, Christian missionaries have
taken advantage of this social indifference and often ostracization of such people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the past, conversions to Islam have also occurred, but not so much
among tribal members as among the section outside formal Hindu society known as the
untouchables (Dalits), who were treated with the worst forms of oppression and
stigmatization. They are so low that they are not even inside the formal framework of the
oppressive and infamous caste system. Some small sections of these people have turned to
other religions&#151;among them Islam&#151;in the search for equality and dignity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hindu bodies allege that illiterates are hoodwinked into changing
their religion, but often educated people convert. The most famous incident of
untouchables converting to Islam happened in Meenakshipuram, a small town in Southern
India. All these people were educated untouchables who held decent jobs and were
reasonably well-to-do. But they still faced social ostracization and stigmatization
because of their caste status as untouchables. As a result, they turned to Islam, which
offered them equal status with each of their fellow humans in the eyes of Allah. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, conversions have become a political tool in today&#146;s
communally charged atmosphere. A few weeks ago, a colony of untouchables in Northern India
threatened to convert <i>en masse</i> to Islam if they were evicted from the government
property they had been squatting on for countless years. They were even in touch with a <i>Qadi</i>.
The fact is that Hindu society has left the space open for such conversions. Faced with
discrimination based on the caste system, finding no dignified space or socio-economic
opportunities for themselves within that society, turning to other religions is quite
natural. In fact, it is rather surprising that the number of conversions are so low. That
this may be the case says something about the attitude of Muslims in India, many of whom
have adopted the worst aspects of Hindu society, such as belief in social
&#145;castes&#146;, demand for dowry from the bride&#146;s family and a tendency to look
down on former untouchables in the same manner as the caste-ridden Hindus do. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">A Winter&#146;s Song</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>By: Ruth Anderson</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the heart of a Middle Eastern capital, you can find Ali, a widower, and
his four children. On the day of Al Eid, Ali celebrated by visiting the grave of his
recently deceased wife. He left his children in his dark, bare house asleep. Anyway, there
was really nothing to celebrate. He lost his inadequately paying job as a janitor in a
nearby health clinic because he was sick and is now living on a stipend of only $70 per
month. This very meager income must feed, clothe and support the needs of four children
plus pay rent. To make things more difficult, Ali&#146;s oldest boy, about 15, is deaf.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While some of the more well-to-do were out celebrating the Eid in posh
restaurants or at the homes of friends and relatives, the widower was just trying to put
some bread and tea on his table and open a window to bring a shaft of light into his
dismal one room home. In this home could be found no meat dish like the traditional mensaf
for there was no woman to cook it on the one hand, and no money to purchase the
ingredients on the other. He could not afford to buy Eid clothes for his children and
while other neighborhood kids played with fireworks and toys, his own children spent the
day without a meal, without a mother, without hope. Perhaps there is no enemy worse than
abject poverty and perhaps no home more dim than one without the soothing hand of a mother
and wife.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ramadan is a month of fasting from dawn to dusk. One of the purposes of a
whole month of fasting is so that those who have can empathize with those who do not. In
days long gone by, alms given by those who could afford to pay them, sustained those who
had no jobs and source of income. &#147;Modern&#148; times see few who give to the less
fortunate and no concerted national or international effort to alleviate the financial
sufferings of the Muslim poor. If each Muslim nation gave alms in the same manner that the
early followers of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) did, then it would be hard indeed to find
people who did not have jobs and food on the table.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, who was the second and probably the greatest of the
Muslim caliphs made personally certain that no poverty existed under his sovereignty. He
would go out at night alone and search for someone, anyone who was hungry and without
provisions. If a mule or horse stumbled on a road not properly taken care of, Omar would
feel personally responsible. One night he came across a mother who was cooking stones. He
approached her as if he were any ordinary person without rank or importance and asked her
why she was cooking stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She replied, &#147;Because Omar is not taking care of us. I am cooking
stones so my children will fall asleep and forget about their hunger.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Caliph Omar then went out and got her flour and other provisions to feed
her children and more than that, he bent down and started her fire again and began to cook
the meal for her himself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, there are no caliphs who search for the poor and underprivileged.
Most Arab/Muslim leaders these days pocket the money that should go to the destitute and
not only that, milk their countries dry of money and resources leaving a stark sharp
contrast between the wealthy few and the starving majority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no Caliph Omar to help out poor destitute Ali and his family. And
for a man such as Ali, who does not enjoy the best of health and is poorly educated, hope
for a decent future for him and his children is more of a pipe dream than a reality. Just
another Winter&#146;s song sung to ears that hear but do not really listen.</p>
