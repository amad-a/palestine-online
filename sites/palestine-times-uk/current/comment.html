Palestinian Refugees</font></span><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Professor Sari Nusseibeh recently gave a lecture at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem during which he reportedly exhorted the Palestinian leadership to cede
the right of return of Palestinian refugees who were deported from their
homeland by the Zionist State of Israel in 1948.</p>
<p>Addressing an overwhelmingly right-wing Jewish audience, he explained that
Israel would never accept the repatriation of a significant number of refugees
as this would spell the end of Israel as a Jewish State.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nusseibeh argued that the Palestinians were being inconsistent
in demanding a State of their own in “occupied territories,” and at the same
time insisting that the refugees be repatriated to their original towns and
villages in what is now Israel.</p>
<p>Nobody, of course, would want to restrict Nusseibeh’s freedom of
expression. He is a free man, and he can tell his Zionist friends whatever they
want to hear from a Palestinian.</p>
<p>And what they want to hear is amply clear and needs no further clarification.</p>
<p>The Zionists want the Palestinian people to finally declare that they have no
rights or further claims to Palestine and that the Jewish terrorists were
actually doing the right thing in 1948 when they, at gunpoint, expelled the bulk
of the indigenous Palestinians from their ancestral homeland.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Nusseibeh believes that the refugees, especially those
still languishing in squalid camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, should just
forget about their right of return and swallow their 53-year-old anger just in
order to enable the Zionists to have an all-Jewish State in Palestine. (Who says
their goals stop at Palestine?)</p>
<p>However, an objective examination of Nusseibeh’s views leaves no doubt as
to what he is really aiming at:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the liquidation of the Palestinian cause.</p>
<p>To begin with, his argument that the Palestinians can’t have a State,
presumably on parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and at the same time seek
to solve the refugee problem at Israel’s expense, is spurious and scandalous
and misleading.</p>
<p>First of all, the contemplated Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza
would be established on less than 21% of mandatory Palestine, supposing Israel
would agree to fully pull out of the occupied territories of 1967.</p>
<p>This means that Israel, with a population of around 6 million, would retain
at least 79% of Palestine without any obligation to admit a significant number
of refugees. Whereas the burgeoning and tiny Palestinian “State” consisting
of only 21% of Palestine would be burdened with millions of additional refugees.
(There are already more than a million refugees in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip). Now, would an arrangement as such be fair? Would it be a true
prescription for a lasting peace in Palestine?</p>
<p>Hence, the argument that the perceivably nonviable and even insignificant
Palestinian “State” should absorb all those dispossessed refugees is
illogical. Indeed, such a prospect would only doom that State and its congested
inhabitants to perpetual misery and poverty—by any standard a prescription for
continued instability and violence.</p>
<p>So, the truth of the matter is that Israel, with its comparatively huge
territory, is more able to receive and settle those tormented refugees who, in
the final analysis, want nothing but to go home.</p>
<p>Nusseibeh and his Israeli friends may retort by arguing that by admitting
(the right word is repatriating) a significant number of refugees, the identity
of Israel as a Jewish State would be undermined.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily true in light of the unceasing stream of Jewish
immigrants into Palestine, and, given the prospect that the refugees, supposing
they, or a significant number of them, are repatriated, they wouldn’t come in
a single huge exodus, for practical political, economic and logistical
considerations.</p>
<p>Moreover, and this brings us to the second point, it is none of the
refugees’ fault if the Jewish identity of the Israeli State would be
undermined.</p>
<p>The refugees and their ancestors have an absolute, inalienable, and personal
right to return to their homes and villages in their ancestral fatherland in
accordance with United Nations resolution 194, as well as all other conceivable
laws and norms, man-made or God-made.</p>
<p>The right of return is a personal as well a collective right, and nobody,
including Yasser Arafat and Sari Nusseibeh, has any right or authority to
compromise or sign it away.</p>
<p>Such a perfidious signature, even if done in an impressive ceremony at the
White House lawn with celebrities from all over the world invited to witness the
big lie, wouldn’t hold.</p>
<p>It is really disquieting how Mr. Nusseibeh, who can’t even sign a simple
document on behalf of his own wife or son, grants himself the right to sign away
the ancestral homeland of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Mr. Nusseibeh and those who think like him may feel depressed, defeated and a
sense of despair. They may feel that the Palestinians should agree to take
something lest they lose everything, because “something is better than
nothing.” Feelings as such are really normal among people who don’t place
the conflict over Palestine in its proper historical context, people bereft of
the faith in the justice of their cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, Nusseibeh would be well-advised not to exceed his bounds. He is
the scion of a prominent Palestinian family. The motherland expects him to be
more faithful.</p>
