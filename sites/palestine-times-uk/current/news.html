rampage&nbsp;<br>
of terror against Palestinians</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Occupied Jerusalem</b> - After much sabre-rattling,
procrastination, and murdering, injuring and maiming hundreds of innocent
civilians, the Israeli government ordered its occupation army to re-deploy from
the twin-towns of Bethlehem and Beit Jala on 29 October.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Israeli tanks attacked and re-occupied the two
unprotected cities on 19 October, following the assassination of Jewish
terrorist leader Rahba’am Ze’evi at the hands of PFLP guerillas in
retaliation for the assassination by Jewish terrorists seven weeks earlier of
PFLF leader Abu Ali Mustafa.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The rampage of murder and terror, which lasted ten days,
resulted in the murderous death of nearly 23 Palestinians, the vast bulk of them
civilians, including four housewives, four children, five boys and two labourers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Among the victims were at least four Christians,
including Johnny Thaljiya, a Christian altar boy who was strolling around
outside the Church of the Nativity.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The “withdrawal” itself did not seem to have much
significance from the security vantage point as the Israeli tanks only moved a
few hundred metres away from the city-centres of both Bethlehem and Beit Jala.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, it would be more appropriate to speak about
“repositioning” rather than “withdrawal” of the Israeli occupation
troops from the two towns.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Nonetheless, it was clear that the departure of the
Zionist forces was carried out under some American pressure and despite a real
reluctance on Sharon’s part.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The U.S. apparently wanted to “calm things down” in
Palestine in order not to undermine the American crusade against Afghanistan,
while Sharon seemed utterly disinterested in mitigating the intensity of his
State terror against the Palestinian population.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Americans, sources said, stepped up their pressure on
Sharon to order his army to leave Bethlehem and Beit Jala after the occupation
army fired on “unusual targets” in the two cities, including the Church of
the Nativity—the traditional birthplace of Jesus—and Bethlehem University,
which has strong ties with the Vatican.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Notwithstanding, the Israeli army remains in effective
control of virtually all Palestinian towns in the West Bank since Israeli tanks
are deployed in positions well-inside these towns, which enable the Israelis to
strafe civilians with heavy machine-gun fire on a daily basis, killing more
innocent people and inflicting more damage to residential homes.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, by PT press time, the Israeli army is still
effectively occupying and encircling the towns of Jenin, Tulkarm, Nablus and
Qalqilya, as well as Ramallah, thus practically undoing and nullifying the Oslo
Accords.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Zionist army was even preparing to re-enter the city-centres
of Tulkarm and Jenin on 29 October, following the killing of five Israeli
soldiers and settlers near Baqa al-Gharbiya and Khadera.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Meanwhile, it was amply clear that while the Palestinian
Authority was doing everything in its power to maintain the cease-fire, Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was doing everything in his power to keep his
State-sponsored terror and murder going unabated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, Sharon has repeatedly vowed to keep up his policy
of assassination, which he euphemistically calls “targeted killing”, while
continuing to accuse the Palestinians of carrying out “acts of terror”
against Zionist occupation targets.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Clearly, Sharon is not really interested in the
restoration of even a semblance of calm to the West Bank and Gaza Strip as this
would expose his political bankruptcy to the whole world, especially the United
States, Israel’s strategic ally and financier and abettor of Jewish terror and
hegemony.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The certified war criminal was elected on 6 February,
based on his promise to “crush the intifada” through the use of excessive
force against the Palestinians who aspire for freedom from Jewish occupation and
apartheid.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hence, any restoration of calm or resumption of the
moribund peace process could cause his government to collapse.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sharon can’t remain Prime Minister and enter into
meaningful negotiations with the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He simply is not willing to pay the price for any genuine
peace agreement with the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hence, his rabid efforts to sustain an atmosphere of
terror and murder.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sharon’s method to evade paying the political price for
Israel’s insincere acceptance of the Mitchell recommendations lies in trying
to reduce the Palestinian cause from “a military occupation” to “an issue
of terror.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, he repeatedly made the silly argument that
“terror is terror, whether in New York or Netanya,” thus brazenly ignoring
the Israeli military occupation of Palestine and the enduring terror and murder
against the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">To facilitate his evil tactics concerning the subject of
“terror,” he vowed to continue the policy of assassination against
Palestinian activists and leaders.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">His evil rationale is that the Palestinians would seek to
retaliate, thus giving him the needed munitions to argue that there can be no
“peace talks” until there was “total quiet”, when in fact he, and he
alone, makes every conceivable effort to foster tension and violence.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Palestinian Authority realizes Sharon’s political
and public relations game and is fully aware that any progress will not be
possible as long as Sharon is in power in Israel and as long as the United
States refuses to exert genuine pressure on the Jewish State.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sharon, as is well known, is against Israeli withdrawal
from the bulk of the West Bank, and insists that any prospective Palestinian
political entity in the West Bank and Gaza would have to be under Israeli
control and influence. In other words, apartheid is the solution, as far as
Sharon is concerned.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hence, it would be safe to conclude that whatever
measures taken by the Zionist regime and the PA, they are not aimed at reviving
the hapless peace process, but rather at scoring public relations points here
and there.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And the reason for that is the fact that the Zionist
regime has not taken a strategic decision to reach peace with the Palestinians.</p>

</b></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>Occupied
Jerusalem </b>- Citing Palestinian national interests and warning that all
Palestinian resistance groups must observe the “cease-fire” reached with
Israel a few weeks ago, the Palestinian Authority has begun a crackdown on the
PFLP, which claimed responsibility for the assassination on 17 October of the
racist Israeli leader Rahba’am Ze’evi.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Thus, on 21 October, the PA outlawed the group’s small
but effective military wing, and detained “for questioning” more than 20
prominent political leaders and activists of the organization that was once
second only to Fatah in terms of popularity and prominence among Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The ban came as the Israeli occupation army effectively
re-occupied most of the Palestinian towns, practically undoing and perhaps
nullifying the Oslo Accords.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Among the people arrested are Ali Jaradat, PFLP
spokesman; and Dr. Ahmad Musalmani and Dr. Rabah Mohannah, both members of the
Front’s politburo and heads of two important non-governmental organizations in
Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Moreover, Palestinian sources reported on 22 October that
PA Preventive Security Chief in the West Bank, Jebril Rajoub, issued an
ultimatum to PFLP leader Ahmed Sa’adat to turn himself in or fact arrest.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Rajoub was quoted as saying that “the PA is committed
to implementing its part of the cease-fire package,” adding, “this includes
arresting anyone who violates the decision taken by the Palestinian legal
institutions.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Israel earlier alleged that it was Sa’adat who had
ordered Ze’evi’s assassination in retaliation for the assassination by the
Israeli army of PFLP former leader Abu Ali Mustafa in Ramallah nearly two months
ago.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, PA security agencies have been harassing
PFLP activists and supporters, ostensibly to demonstrate to Israel and the
United States that it is serious about combating “terrorism.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Key PA spokesmen—Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo
and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Nabil Amre—have painstakingly tried to
explain to a suspecting Palestinian public, which is not giving the PA the
benefit of the doubt, that the crackdown was necessary for national interests.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We can’t allow a group of individuals to destroy the
national cause. There is one Palestinian Authority and everybody must abide by
the decisions of that authority, or else anarchy will prevail,” said Amre.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Abed Rabbo hinted that the murderers of Ze’evi
unwittingly served Sharon’s bellicose designs against the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We know that Sharon wanted to dismantle the
Palestinian Authority and redefine the Palestinian Question from one of illegal
occupation to one of violence and terror. Hence, we believe the killers of
Ze’evi served Sharon with the needed pretext to carry out his evil designs
against the Palestinians.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Predictably, the PFLP and other Palestinian opposition
groups, including Hamas, rejected outright PA reasoning to that effect.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“I think the PA should never cave in to Sharon’s
dictates and blackmailing demands. The PA should have told Sharon that he should
hand in the killers of Abu Ali Mustafa in return for turning in to Israel the
killers of Ze’evi. Ze’evi’s blood is not more precious than that of Abu
Ali Mustafa,” said Maher al-Taher, a spokesman for the PFLP.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He added that his and other Palestinian resistance groups
were, after all, defending themselves and the entire Palestinian population
against the much-superior Israeli terrorism.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We believe that we have an absolute right to
self-defense. It is the Israeli army that is spreading murder and terror
everywhere. Should we tell the criminal Zionists ‘thanks’ for killing our
children?”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Undoubtedly, this argument on the part of the PFLP
attracts overwhelming sympathy and understanding from virtually all segments of
the Palestinian society, including Fatah, Yasser Arafat’s own organization.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Hamas, which could be the next target of PA suppression
if its military wing was to carry out a high-profile operation against Israeli
targets, condemned the crackdown on the PFLP, calling it “a shameful surrender
to Israeli pressure.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We believe the arrest of the resistance fighters by
the PA is a tremendous political and moral mistake. The PA should realize that
Sharon would give us nothing even if half of the Palestinians were
incarcerated,” said Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He added that it was “illogical and unacceptable that
Sharon continues to assassinate, murder and maim Palestinians while the PA is
arresting those who rise up to defend our people. It is Sharon and his murderous
army who are the real terrorists who should be arrested and tried for crimes
against humanity.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Interestingly, the PA doesn’t completely reject this
argument.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">However, the PA retorts that, whatever the case may be,
the Palestinians should strive to isolate Sharon in the international arena,
particularly after the United States and Britain expressed clear verbal support
for the creation of Palestinian Statehood.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We know and understand that Sharon and (Israeli chief
of staff Shaul) Mofaz use the so-called terror to expedite their political
goals, namely the liquidation of the Palestinian cause and the destruction of
the PA. However, it is very important that we strip them of this excuse so that
we can expose them before the entire world.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Nevertheless, the PA task of maintaining the cease-fire
and “reining-in” the opposition, which now includes sizeable segments of
Fatah, is not going to be easy at all if only because the Israeli army is
continuing, even escalating, its rampage of murder and terror throughout the
West Bank.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On 20 October, Israeli occupation soldiers murdered
Mustafa Abdul Rahman Nufal, an Islamist leader, in Qaliqilya, reportedly in full
view of his wife and children.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“They captured him, and then shot him in the back and
the head several times; then they shot him yet again in the head to make sure he
was dead. All that happened in the full view of our children,” related Mr.
Nufal’s brother.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mr. Nufal’s brother went on to say that “they could
have arrested him and taken him to jail if they had anything against him. They
could have tried him before a court of law. But they were not interested in
this; they wanted to murder and shed blood.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“He would have gone underground if he had thought that
he was a dangerous man as the Zionists alleged,” Nufal’s brother said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On 22 October, the Israeli army likewise murdered Ayman
Halaweh, the head of the Izzedin al-Qassam squad in Nablus.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, the number of the Palestinians killed since the
assassination of Ze’evi on 17 October has so far reached 25, the vast bulk of
them students, children, housewives, and olive growers. And the killing is
continuing unabated, and Sharon is continuing to shout “terror…terror.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Needless to say, such murderous oppression exerts immense
pressure on Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups to retaliate in pure
self-defense.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Sharon will continue to murder our people with and
without the cease-fire. So, we prefer to die fighting than to be slaughtered
like meek sheep by his criminal killers,” said a Hamas official in the
Bethlehem region.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“The world doesn’t understand the situation here.
Sharon is not after terror and violence; he is after the entire Palestinian
people and its just cause.”</p>

&nbsp;resistance movement with Bin Laden</b></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b>Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Seeking to capitalize on
the 11 September attacks in Washington and New York, Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon has been utilizing timely political and public relations ploys to
press the United States into treating Islamic resistance movements in Palestine
and Lebanon on an equal footing with Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sharon, a certified war criminal for his role in the 1982
Sabra and Shatilla massacres, repeatedly urged U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell not “to distinguish between terrorist attacks and terror acts.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In conversations with Powell after the 11 September
attacks, Sharon—a certified war criminal by any standard—argued that
Palestinian resistance against Israeli occupation and apartheid were “terror
acts”, very much the same as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
in New York and the Pentagon in Washington.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The manifestly corrupt analogy was reiterated by several
Israeli politicians, including the ostensibly more levelheaded Shimon Peres, and
parroted by some American Jewish leaders who just act at Israel’s beck and
call.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sharon, of course, knew that the Jewish lobby, which he
reportedly recently boasted that it controlled the Congress, the two political
parties and the White House, had successfully pressurized the American
administration to blacklist Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and Hizbullah as terrorist
organizations for their struggle against and resistance of Israeli occupation,
which basically means that the old Zionist mass murderer wants the U.S. to
declare war on these movements for what they represent, namely the Palestinian
national struggle for freedom and liberation of the Nazi-like Jewish military
domination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sharon, according to the right-wing extremist newspaper,
the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, told Powell that the three Arab Islamic resistance
movements emanated from Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda organization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sharon’s claim to that effect is, of course, completely
false. It is a cheap and vindictive exercise in Zionist propaganda and
disinformation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The three groups, whose <i>raison d'être </i>is, as has
always been the case, the Israeli occupation of Arab land, predated Bin
Laden’s group by many years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hizbullah is a Lebanese Shiite resistance movement and has
absolutely no ties with the Bin Laden group, which describes itself as a puritan
Sunni organization. Hamas and its junior sister, the Islamic Jihad, are linked
to older Islamic organizations in the Arab world such as the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Muslim Brotherhood dates back to the 1930s, more than
half a century before the world ever heard the name Bin Laden.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, scoffed
at Sharon’s “PR game.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>“Sharon
himself is a grand terrorist, presiding over a terrorist State that spreads
terror everywhere, murders civilians, demolishes civilians’ homes, confiscates
civilians’ land, bulldozes orchards and vineyards, and turns entire cities and
towns into huge concentrations camps,” said Rantisi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>“Who is the
terrorist? The one who sends his F-16s and apache helicopters to rain death on
innocent civilians and unprotected towns, or the one who uses stones to get rid
of a satanic military occupation intent on annihilating an entire people for
wanting to be free?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He added that “putting Sharon’s terrorist impulses
aside, it is sad that people like Colin Powell give ear to this criminal
terrorist. We, therefore, call on the American administration not to let
terrorist States like Israel and terrorist leaders like Sharon spoil their
country. They should put an end to him.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rantisi said, “The Palestinian people can’t be
terrorists since they are the victims of Jewish terror.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“They took our land away from us; they expelled us from
our towns and villages; they forced us into squalid refugee camps; they murdered
hundreds of thousands of our people; and after all this murder and terror, they
still have the moral brazenness to call us terrorists?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even the Palestinian Authority, which is normally
circumspect in its outspoken reactions to Israeli terrorism, strongly condemned
“the grand terrorist of the world.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><b>Occupied
Jerusalem –</b> “My deaf child posed no risk or threat to the Occupation
soldiers; he is too small, too disabled, too terrified to attack the imperial
army. Then why did they shoot him, why? Why?” with these half-suffocated words
spoke Ahmed Wahdan, the father of 13-year-old Eid Wahdan, at a press conference
in Gaza to announce his intention to sue the Israeli government and army for
“committing a callous crime against a deaf child.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">On 9
October, Wahdan was riding a donkey-hauled cart carrying wood at the Jabalya
refugee camp in Gaza when Israeli occupation soldiers opened fire on Eid,
injuring him seriously in the chest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">His
father said, “My son would have died instantly had the soldiers fired from a
closer location…they were 1,500 metres away.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">He,
however, laments that “they (the Israeli occupation army) kill and maim with
impunity…and there is no credible or authoritative international body that can
put an end to their crimes.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">“But
God won’t forget the criminals and their crimes,” he adds in a reassuring
tone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Asked
why he decided to sue the Israeli army for shooting his son when there is a
little chance that the perpetrators will be prosecuted and punished, Ahmed
Wahdan said, withholding his tears, “At least we make a testimony to the
brutal ugliness of their mentality and the criminal actions of their army.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">“I
know they killed so many innocent people with impunity; I know that the killers
are unlikely to stand trial for their murderous crimes, but God won’t forget
them; there is this life, and there will be the hereafter.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">A

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">“There
is shooting all the time in Gaza, and people get shot and killed; we can’t
keep record of every incident.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Since
the beginning of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation and
apartheid, the Israeli army and paramilitary Jewish terrorists have murdered
over 200 Palestinian children and minors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Virtually
all the victims were shot and killed either deliberately or in random and
indiscriminate strafing and bombardment of Palestinian population centres.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">The
apartheid State never expressed remorse or regret for the killings. On the
contrary, the Israeli army continued to adopt a “shoot-to-kill” policy in
the Occupied territory under the rubric of fighting terrorism.</p>

distributed in military units, and appearing in such pictures had become a
ritualistic “badge of honour.”</p>

is reportedly studying a document prepared by academic circles recommending,
“the ghettoizing of non-Jews throughout Israel” and “stripping
Palestinians of their right to participate in the democratic process,” Israeli
sources said.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The document, presented by Professor Arnon Sofer of Haifa

Palestine be “ghettoized and granted internal autonomy” provided that they
be stripped of their democratic rights.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sofer, an ardent supporter of Rahba’am Ze’evi, the
racist head of the “Moledet party” (a junior coalition partner in the Sharon
government), also recommended that half a million Jewish immigrants from the
former Soviet Union be settled around Arab population centres in Israel “in
order to suffocate the Arab demographic expansion.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Sofer also argued that while apartheid is reviled
elsewhere in the world, the Israeli State must accept some elements of apartheid
in order to maintain the racial quality of Israel as a Jewish State.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Palestinian leaders in the Jewish State described
Sofer’s ideas as “Jewish in name, Nazi in substance.”</p>
