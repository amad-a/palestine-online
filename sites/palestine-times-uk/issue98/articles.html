<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian refugees and struggling with
hopelessness</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">By Mahmoud al-Khatib</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Less than 24 hours after statements made by U.S. President Clinton
indicating that he wished to see the Palestinian refugees free to live any place they
want, the U.S. State Department rushed to withdraw these statements and explain them. The
Palestinian Authority officials had snatched these statements considering them as a change
in the U.S. Administration&#146;s policy and that Mr. Clinton was supporting the right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland. But the PA officials were disappointed
and frustrated when James Foley, the spokesman for the U.S. State Department, announced
that it was only a slip of the President&#146;s tongue (who is famous for having all kinds
of slips)!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those who watched the press conference between President Husni Mubarak of
Egypt and the U.S. President saw how Mr. Clinton was embarrassed and surprised by an
Egyptian journalist&#146;s question that made a comparison between the U.S. stand
regarding the repatriation of the Kosovo refugees and its stand towards the return of the
Palestinian refugees to their homeland occupied by the Jewish State in 1948. I think Mr.
Clinton was embarrassed because he was not aware of the Palestinian refugees&#146; ordeal.
This made him contradict the official policy of the U.S. Administration. For, if Mr.
Clinton knew that the Palestinian refugee issue was listed on the agenda of the final
status talks between the PLO and Israel, he would have said so to escape from any possible
embarrassment. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Foley, under pressure by the Jewish and Zionist lobbies in the U.S.
Administration, rushed to apologize and to drop statements made by his boss. He said that
the U.S. would not interfere in an issue that is supposed to be discussed by the parties
concerned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists, of course, would not let such statements by Mr. Clinton be
snatched up by the international news agencies because the right of return for the
Palestinian refugees is a highly sensitive issue. There is almost unanimous agreement
among the Israelis in rejecting the right of return to Palestinian refugees. The Zionists
do not give a glimmer of hope that these refugees could return home although United
Nations resolutions state that they should be allowed to return, and that those
Palestinians who opt otherwise should be compensated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis ask where and how can more than 4 million Palestinian
refugees be absorbed into the Jewish State. This is an unfair question because the
Palestinian refugees are the real owners of the land on which the Zionists are now living.
The fair solution, in my opinion, is that the Zionists go back to where they came from: be
it Russia, Europe, the United States or the Arab countries. Until this end can be
achieved, the Palestinian refugees have enough space to live in their original homeland.
According to recent surveys, 78% of the Israelis live in only 15% of what is now called
Israel, while the other 22% live in the remaining 85% of that area. The absolute majority
of the Jews live in a dozen towns or so. Only 2.7% of the Israeli Jews exploit Palestinian
land. Therefore, only 154,000 rural Jews control 17,325 square kilometres, which is the
home and heritage of more than 4 million refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis have never asked themselves why more than two thirds of the
Palestinian population are refugees and homeless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist regime does not only reject the return of Palestine refugees
to their homeland, but it also strongly rejects the return of the displaced Palestinians
who were forced to leave their homes in the West Bank following the Arab-Israeli war in
June 1967. There are some 800,000 displaced persons who left the West Bank and migrated to
the East Bank. The West Bank at the time was a part of Jordan and that&#146;s why the
Palestinians who left the West Bank in 1967 were classified as displaced persons. But the
Zionist regime insists that there were only 200,000 displaced Palestinians according to
the UN figures. Yes, this number was somehow correct, but this Palestinian population grew
naturally over the last three decades. Their children who were born in exile have the
right to return with their parents to their homeland. Despite that, the Israelis, during
the quadrilateral committee meetings on the displaced persons, suggested that they would
allow only a few thousand of the 200,000 displaced Palestinians (without their children)
to go back to the West Bank every year. This means that the last displaced Palestinian
maybe be allowed to return home after 50 or 60 years! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The question of the Palestinian refugees is one of the other complicated
and serious issues that were adjourned to the final status negotiations: the status of
Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, the borders and the water. It
is not fair to let these issues be negotiated between the tyrant Zionist regime and the
insufficient and corrupt Palestinian Authority. There is no balance of power between the
two parties and hence the outcome of the negotiations on these serious issues would be
disastrous for the Palestinian people in general. The PA is not the honest Palestinian
leadership that can defend the legitimate rights of the Palestinian refugees and the
Palestinians in general. This leadership has abandoned the refugee cause from the
beginning when it, in 1993, recognized the Zionist usurpation and occupation regime before
it could get any considerable &#147;relinquishment&#148; from the Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the coming future, the Palestinian refugees can live any place they
want, according to Mr. Clinton&#146;s slip of the tongue, except living in their own homes
and land on which the Israelis are now building their State.</p>

<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></font><font color="#FF0000">Murder, expulsion -- and silence *</font><b><i><u><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"></u></i>By Abdel-Azim Hammad</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>After the Wye River Memorandum was signed, I asked the US ambassador
about its possible long-term political implications. Does an agreement signed by a Likud
premier, which promises to hand over territory to the Palestinian Authority, mean the
renunciation by the Likud of its policy of &quot;transfer&quot; (emptying the West Bank of
its Palestinian population to remove the final hurdle to the establishment of Greater
Israel)? Surprised by the question, the ambassador assured me that he had never heard
anyone in the Likud -- or, for that matter, in Israel -- mention a plan for the
&quot;transfer&quot; of Palestinians, except the extremist Rabbi Meir Kahan (assassinated
some years ago in New York) and his followers, who are isolated from mainstream political
life in Israel. <br>
I was just as surprised by his answer. True, none of the Zionist and Israeli leaders has
ever mentioned plans to &quot;transfer&quot; the Palestinian population or to purge it
through ethnic cleansing. But their actions have been far more eloquent than any
statements could ever have been. <br>
The argument regarding Zionist and, later, Israeli ethnic cleansing practices had thus
moved from the realm of academia to formal diplomatic confrontation within the context of
the peace process. Israel immediately refused any grounds for comparison between the
Palestinian refugees and the Kosovar Albanians, anxious to avoid any suggestion that the
same approach should be adopted regarding the Palestinian refugees. Israel has always
maintained that the Palestinian refugees left their country voluntarily, and therefore
relinquished their right to repatriation. As &quot;proof&quot;, it trundled out the
moth-eaten myth of Palestine as a land without a people. In a statement published in the
Sunday Times on 15 May 1969, Golda Meir denied the very existence of the Palestinian
people, concluding that Israel could not have expelled or expropriated them, since
&quot;they do not exist!&quot; <br>
Now the wall of silence surrounding the rights of the Palestinian refugees and the ethnic
cleansing campaigns carried out by all Israeli governments came tumbling down. We need to
collect all the information we can about the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. Any
mention of the practice inside and outside Israel will help Arab diplomats counter the
American and Israeli propaganda war and win over public opinion, especially in the West.
Israeli propaganda must be revealed for what it is, once and for all. Israel claims that
the Palestinians left their villages voluntarily or were told to do so by the Arab
leaders. But when global attention questions these claims, Israel claims that the
Palestinians never existed in the first place. <br>
Israel Shahak has given a detailed account of Israel's repressive practices, writing that
&quot;Israeli bulldozers crushed villages, fields and cemeteries&quot;. Benny Morris, one
of the most prominent Israeli new historians, confirms that, out of a total of 475
villages inside Israel, 418 were wiped out for good. The Arabs have long known it, and the
new historians admit it willingly: Palestine was never &quot;a land without a people for a
people without a land&quot;. Its people did not leave it willingly: they were massacred
and expelled. Morris, too, writes that, as early as the '30s, members of the Jewish
Agency, among them Ben Gurion, planned to establish a Jewish state with the smallest Arab
minority possible. According to the same historian, Ben Gurion, who was particularly deft
at political manoeuvres, struggled relentlessly to abrogate a clause in the Liberal Party
programme (which was not his party) demanding ethnic cleansing. At the same time, he
showed no compunction in carrying out the same policy. While his followers understood his
message, there were no explicit statements to enrage world opinion, for Israel needed the
support of the UN, which was about to confer legitimacy upon the establishment of Israel. <br>
On 2 November 1947, only days before the General Assembly adopted the resolution for the
partition of Palestine, Ben Gurion warned his followers that the major problem facing the
Jewish state was its population. The Jews, he said, constitute 60 per cent of the area to
be assigned by the United Nations to Israel. There would be no guarantee, therefore, for
the establishment of a Jewish regime, or a strong, stable Jewish government. He urged them
to adopt a new position, revise all their ideas and think in terms of statehood. This
meant the displacement, transfer and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population. <br>
The Jewish Agency immediately set up a committee for this purpose. Its records have
allowed Morris to demonstrate that some 460,000 Palestinians were evicted by the threat or
actual use of force. The massacres in Deir Yassin and other villages are instances of a
consistent policy, with a clear goal: to decimate the Palestinian population. The Israeli
claim that Ben Gurion's statement meant encouraging new waves of Jewish immigrants to
Israel is untenable. Immigration to Israel in the '30s was already an ongoing process,
which had begun at the end of the 19th century. No revision of policies was required in
this respect. <br>
Even the records of the Israeli transfer committee present us with half-truths, however.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East
(UNRWA) has placed the number of Palestinian refugees forced to leave their homeland in
accordance with Ben Gurion's plans at 900,000 in 1948 -- in other words, nearly double the
number of refugees declared by the Israeli committee. The truth is that since 1937, the
concept of eviction or ethnic cleansing was part of the policy of the Zionist movement, as
revealed by the documents of the committee established by the British to inquire into the
causes for the Great Arab Revolt of 1936 and to suggest solutions for the problems in
Palestine. Official Israeli historians claim that the idea of eviction was imposed on the
Zionist agenda through its deliberate insertion into the recommendations of this
committee. But the new school of historiography in Israel has discovered that the Zionist
movement in fact imposed the recommendation on the British. This is of little consequence,
however. What matters is that eviction and displacement constituted an established Israeli
strategy, recognised and implemented, regardless of its certificate of ownership. <br>
Israel's ethnic cleansing campaign created the refugee problem. While the UN has
recognised the right of Palestinian refugees to repatriation, Israel will not implement
the resolution. President Clinton found himself cornered on this matter. He was forced
into recognising their right to return, since the right had been already recognised for
the Kosovo Albanian refugees. NATO went to war against Yugoslavia to ensure that the right
of repatriation was fully implemented. The world must not allow silence to shroud this
human tragedy any longer. <br>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Nine Hundred Years and Two Crusades</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></i>Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the morning of Friday, 23 Sha&#146;ban 492 H (15 July 1099 AD),
Jerusalem was raped by an estimated 1 million Crusaders who came all the way from Europe
to allegedly liberate local Christians from Islamic oppression. Jerusalem was consequently
turned into a blood pool. Between 60,000 and 70,000 Muslims and Jews were butchered. This
was the ultimate conquest of a trail of blood that extended for thousands of miles. Nine
hundred years later, Jerusalem finds itself once again in bondage. The invading crusade
this time does not hoist the cross but rather the Star of David. The similarities are
striking. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both campaigns originated in Europe, both used religion to justify
aggression and butchery, and both were in essence motivated by purely mundane (secular)
rather than religious considerations. In both cases, too, it was the weakness and disunity
of the Muslims that contributed to the success of the invaders. Reading through Ibn
Kathir&#146;s <i>Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah</i>, one is struck by the resemblance of the
Muslim condition 900 years ago to the modern-day situation. Since the beginning of the
12th volume of his historic encyclopaedia, Ibn Kathir reiterates with every annual event
profile the phrase &#145;<i>inna lillahi wa-inna ilayhi raji'un</i>&#146; (to God we
belong and to Him is our return), a phrase which Muslims utter when afflicted with severe
calamity such as death or great loss. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslim land was divided among feuding sultans who quarreled not only with
each other but even with close relatives or associates over power and wealth. To secure
dominance over other competitors, a Muslim sultan would collaborate with the invading
Crusaders by divulging sensitive information to them and helping them devour more Muslim
towns and villages. When the news of the fall of Jerusalem reached Baghdad, the nominal
capital of the Caliphate, people wept, rushed to the mosques for prayer and urged
mobilization. As crowds gathered just outside Baghdad in preparation for a march toward
the Holy City, news came that the Crusaders totaled a million warriors and that up to
70,000 of the city&#146;s inhabitants had been massacred. The prospects seemed too gloomy
and in the absence of a political will to rush to the aid of vanquished Jerusalem, the
crowds dispersed and the governors continued their indulgence and bickering. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Describing the situation of the Muslims when Jerusalem was invaded in
1099, an Arab poet known as Abul-Muzaffar Al-Abyurdi lamented that tears instead of spears
spoke in response. From his perspective, the fall of Jerusalem reflected the collapse of
religious values and the absence of faith from the hearts of Muslims. Fear of the enemy,
which made Muslims opt for inaction, was indicative of the erosion of <i>taqwa</i>
(fearing the Almighty). According to him, it was obsession with living and anxiousness to
avoid death that brought humiliation and dishonour to the world of Islam. In conclusion,
he regrets that as a result of such degradation, the Muslims of the time had the
willingness to neither support faith nor protect honour. The Muslims took several decades
before they woke up from their slumber. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After 88 years, a Kurdish Muslim leader, who emerged out of Egypt and
united the community under his command, marched toward Ash-Sham and liberated the Holy
City. The city embraced its Muslim liberators who entered its gates peacefully on Friday,
27 Rajab 583 H (2 October 1187). Salah-ud-Din al-Ayyubi, who became a legend, did indeed
lead the Ummah in its rise out of the dark tunnel. But he did not emerge out of the blues;
he was the culmination of an awakening, of a revival movement, that took three quarters of
a century to prevail. In some ways, the 12th century awakening resembles today&#146;s
Islamic awakening. In some other ways, the liberation of Jerusalem after 88 years of
European occupation promises an imminent end to modern-day Zionist occupation of the first
Qiblah. In less than 40 years from now, this vision may just prove to be true.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Will Fatah disintegrate after Arafat?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></i>By Khalid Amayreh</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Fatah, the mainstream faction of the PLO and the
backbone of Yasser Arafat&#146;s Palestinian self-rule authority, is undergoing mounting
internal divisions which some observers interpret as &#147;early signs of a power struggle
in preparation for the post Arafat era.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to insiders in Fatah, the bulk of this brewing struggle and
intra-faction strife within the widely heterogeneous movement takes place below the
surface, often assuming manifestations such as stepped-up polarization, vying for control
of some existing Fatah institutions, as well as seeking to curry favour with the Israelis
and the Americans. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Fatah will disintegrate into many smaller factions, and self-serving
bands if the Fatah leadership doesn&#146;t take prompt action to instill genuine democracy
within the movement,&#148; warned Marwan al-Barghouthi last month. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barghouthi, a Legislative Council member who also assumes the post of
Secretary-General of the Fatah Higher Committee in the West Bank, pointed out that Fatah,
like the PA, remained a centralized movement run almost single-handedly by Yasser Arafat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, Barghouthi has apparently fallen into disfavour with PA
Chairman Yasser Arafat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, Arafat reportedly refused to meet Barghouthi in Ramallah until
he amended his relations with Arafat&#146;s Secretary, Ramzi Khouri, and other top
officials in the President&#146;s office.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the insiders mentioned above, Barghouthi had earlier accused
Khouri of &#147;erecting a stone wall between the President and the people and embezzling
and squandering large sums of money on friends.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah discontent with Arafat has reached the boiling point</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Much of the indignation and internal friction within Fatah can be found in
the Gaza Strip where discontent with Aafat&#146;s nepotistic rule has reached the boiling
point. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Generally, there are two main rival camps involved in the current
acrimony: the returnees or &#147;Tawansah&#148; (e.g. those who returned with Yasser
Arafat from Tunis five years ago and effectively became the privileged class) and
indignant local Fatah activists who feel &#147;let down&#148; and &#147;betrayed&#148; by
the PA leadership. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In late June, a group of disgruntled officers, all of whom are native
Gazans, circulated a communiqué signed by &#147;the free officers&#148; in which they
lashed out at the Palestinian leadership, accusing it of being &#147;penetrated by Zionist
agents, mercenaries and hangers-on who call themselves Fatah but indulge in granting key
jobs to Israeli collaborators while slamming the doors in the face of true patriots.&#148;
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We would like to remind you of those who stole and embezzled the
financial allocations earmarked for the policemen, spending the money on recreation tours
abroad and paying for the luxurious flats and smart cars in Gaza and Ramallah&#133;at a
time when the vanquished members of the security forces are denied their overdue
salaries.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The communiqué went on slamming &#147;the sycophants and hangers-on
around Arafat&#148; saying, &#147;Yes, there are certain people who have the right to eat
in exquisite restaurants and drink (alcoholic beverages) in the Tahuna and Beach bars, and
then pass on the bills to Ramzi Khouri (head of Arafat&#146;s office).&#148; Last year,
the expenses of the President&#146;s office reached US$ 142 million, prompting the donor
countries to &#147;slim down&#148; subsequent donations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The &#147;free officers&#148; addressed the Palestinian people, calling on
them to &#147;put an end to the traitors and thieves whose scheme is to steal and embezzle
as much as they can.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The communiqué named several high-ranking PA security officials,
including Mahmud Sehweil, Amin al Hindi, Jebril Rajoub and Ghazi al Jabali, warning that
&#147;nobody shall be able to protect those traitors from the wrath of the people because
nobody has the right to collaborate with the Zionists at our people&#146;s expense.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, the Palestinian Authority sought to ignore the leaflet which
was distributed throughout the Gaza Strip as well as in parts of the West Bank. However,
after Israeli and British papers, especially the <i>Independent</i>, published the
contents of the leaflet, PA Gaza police chief Ghazi al-Jabali dismissed in a brief press
conference the &#147;free officers&#148; as &#147;a small group with no roots.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that 13 &#147;low-ranking officers&#148; had been arrested
in connection with the leaflet, adding that they would be tried for &#147;defamation and
libel.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">None the less, most observers in the occupied territories doubt the PA
claims that the leaflet was &#147;an isolated phenomenon.&#148; They point out that a
state of profound frustration with the PA is permeating all sectors of the Palestinian
populace, including people considered traditional supporters of Fatah. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the problem extends far beyond the mere outpouring of anger at the
ubiquitous aspects of corruption, nepotism and cronyism throughout the PA, and touches on
the integration of the security agencies, the main base of Arafat&#146;s survival. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the most conspicuous examples of this strife among the security
agencies is the not-so-secret struggle between Preventive Security Force (PSF) Jebril
Rajoub and General Intelligence chief Tawfik Tirawi. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, the increasing rivalry between the two prompted Arafat to
create still another new security agency which he called the &#147;Special Forces&#148;,
to be added to the numerous security agencies which are, at least nominally, answerable to
Arafat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new security agency, to be headed by Col. Bashir Nafei&#146;, a
prominent Fatah activist in the Qalandia refugee camp, just north of Jerusalem, is
apparently designed to neutralize PSF chief Jebril Rajoub, especially after it became
clear that Rajoub was seeking to conclude &#147;arrangements and understandings&#148; with
the Israelis and Americans &#147;behind Yasser Arafat&#146;s back.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, Rajoub is not the only PA official seeking to curry favour
with the Israeli Shabak and the American CIA. Tirawi, too, has demonstrated
&#147;audacious obsequiousness&#148; in this field, so much so that it can be said that he
has earned the title of &#147;Israel&#146;s premier man&#148; within the PA security
establishment. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This probably explains why the Israeli intelligence establishment demanded
two years ago that the PA crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists be carried out by
Tirawi&#146;s <i>mukhabarat </i>rather than by Rajoub&#146;s PSF, as had been the case
before. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, Arafat readily gave his consent, and all the arrests of
Islamist activists were carried out by the General Intelligence ever after. Today, there
are over 300 mostly Islamist detainees interned by Tirawi, without charge or trial. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Multiple Fatah factions</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of the above, it is safe to conclude that Fatah will, in the
not-too-distant future, disintegrate into many &#147;Fatahs&#148;, e.g. Tirawi&#146;s
Fatah, Rajoub&#146;s Fatah, Barghouthi&#146;s Fatah, Fatah of the Returnees, Fatah of the
West Bank and Fatah of the Gaza Strip, with unpredictable ramifications on the Palestinian
people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that manifestations of this disintegration will not appear in
their stark forms before the disappearance of Arafat, the symbol around which and through
which Fatah remained somewhat intact for all these years.</p>

Syrian Man</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></i>By Ramzy Baroud</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Waiting in his cell for death or a miracle is exactly what Yasser
El-Muazen must do after the Tel Aviv District Court shattered his hope of release and of
survival. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser, a Syrian man, was arrested by Israeli forces in occupied South
Lebanon, the area known by Israel as the &#147;Security Zone&#148;. In early 1989, the
Syrian fighter was sentenced to spend 25 years of his life with thousands of his
Palestinian and Arab comrades incarcerated in Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser&#146;s sentence followed a brief trial where an Israeli court found
him guilty for his attempt to carry out an attack in Metulla, near the Lebanese border. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The tragedy of Yasser is a story of two parts<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font>
each is as sorrowful as the other.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of Israel&#146;s demands presented to the Palestinian Authority
(either in a friendly manner or a harsh one) were fulfilled as expeditiously as possible. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, the most basic Palestinian demands, which have been ignored by Israel
year after year, are being added to the Israeli record of disrespect for peace, justice
and mutual agreements. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser and thousands of Palestinian and Arab prisoners most likely do not
fall in the &#147;mutual agreements&#148; category, which have been breached repeatedly by
Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Consequently, Yasser and his comrades must wait for Israel to start
respecting its commitments to peace and to end its violation of human rights. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For such a miracle to take place, the wait is expected to carry on for
many years. And waiting shall be very hard for those inhumanly crammed into very small
cells for years to come. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But it is even harder for Yasser El-Muazen, who suffers from complete
kidney failure, which makes the pain of isolation and imprisonment a less serious matter
than his physical pain. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For some time, Palestinian human rights organizations have been calling on
Israeli courts to order Yasser&#146;s release, for death is imminent if a kidney
transplant is not carried out immediately. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the Tel Aviv District Court agreed to review his case and make a
decision concerning his release. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To ensure positive results, Yasser&#146;s lawyer and many concerned
organizations rushed to the court with all the necessary medical records showing the
seriousness of Muazen&#146;s condition. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also, Syrian doctors confirmed that one of Yasser&#146;s nine brothers who
lives with his family in Damascus was a great match for the needed kidney. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 5 July, the Israeli court delivered its final verdict. Yasser&#146;s
release would jeopardize the security of the State of Israel; therefore his appeal was
denied. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser, weak, sick and no longer able to walk independently, was escorted
back to his cell after his last hope of freedom slowly faded. Yasser&#146;s story
stubbornly forces us to ask the question: Why should Palestinian and Arab prisoners be
held accountable for defending their legitimate rights, while thousands of Israeli
soldiers who participated in the massacring of innocent women and children are roaming the
land carefree and untroubled? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps the hailed peace miracle that rewarded the general of Israel a
Nobel Peace prize fell short of concerning itself with the welfare of those who needed it
the most<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> the oppressed Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sending a man back to his cell, knowing that his death can no longer be
postponed, is an international crime that must be investigated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Yasser were an Israeli, his story would reach the Four Corners of the
earth. But when it comes to a poor, Arab fellow from Syria, the world&#146;s attention
span fails to understand the pain and anguish that he must feel every moment in his damp,
dark prison cell. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, should we just add Yasser to the great list of mournful events in
recent Arab and Palestinian history? Should we forget the young man who was hung by his
feet for days by Israeli interrogators because &#147;he had a dream&#148;? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I hope we don&#146;t. But I am certain that the dreamer shall never stop
dreaming until his soul abandons his ailing body. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only then will Yasser&#146;s fight be over! </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Norman G. Finkelstein</i></p>

<p ALIGN="center">(1-3)</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a formal document, the Wye River Memorandum breaks no new ground. Its
stated purpose is merely to reaffirm and &#147;facilitate implementation&#148; of
&#147;prior agreements.&#148; Nonetheless the memorandum illuminates the process set in
motion at Oslo and dispels lingering illusions. In these remarks, I will first sketch the
crucial historical background, then analyze the document and, finally, consider the
prospects for a just settlement.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Background</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The aim of the mainstream Zionist movement from its inception a century
ago has been to create a Jewish state in Palestine. Ideally, this meant a state with a
homogeneously Jewish population; for practical purposes, a state with an overwhelming
Jewish population, tolerating a small Arab minority of perhaps 20 percent.1</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The main obstacle to the realization of this goal was the indigenous Arab
population. In his recently published quasi-official history of Israel, British historian
Martin Gilbert argues that &#147;there was a strong desire among the Labor Zionists to
live together with the Arabs, and not, as many of the extremists hoped, to make them
subordinate to Jewish nationalist needs, or even to drive them out of Palestine
altogether.&#148; Scholarship does not sustain this claim. Labor Zionism was committed to
the &#147;building of a Jewish society by Jews alone, from foundation stone to
rafter&#148; in &#147;all of Palestine&#148; (Anita Shapira). Accordingly, as Zeev
Sternhell shows in an important study, &#147;nobody fought against the Arab worker more
vigorously than [Labor Zionists]; nobody preached national, economic, and social
segregation with more determination than the Labor movement.&#148;2</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Faced with indigenous resistance, European conquest movements in the
post-Columbus era typically resorted to the most brute force: extermination. Yet, by the
early twentieth century this extreme option was no longer available. The Zionist movement
thus set its sights on &#147;population transfer&#148; &#151; the euphemism for expulsion
&#151; of the indigenous population. Indeed until after World War II, international
opinion acquiesced in expulsion as a means of resolving ethnic conflicts.3 Historian Benny
Morris observes that, for the Zionist leadership, &#147;transferring the Arabs out&#148;
was seen as the &#147;chief means&#148; of &#147;assuring the stability and
&#145;Jewishness&#146; of the proposed Jewish state.&#148; During the 1948 war, the Arab
population was effectively expelled from the conquered areas of Palestine, completing the
first phase of Zionist conquest.4</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the course of the June 1967 war, Israel conquered the long-coveted West
Bank and Gaza,5 as well as the Sinai and Golan Heights. In this second phase of conquest,
the Zionist leadership confronted the same dilemma as earlier in the century: it wanted
the land but not the people. The options available for resolving this dilemma, however,
had considerably narrowed. Not only extermination but expulsion as well was no longer
politically tenable.6 The Zionist movement accordingly opted for encirclement:
appropriating as much of the resources (especially water) and land as was feasible while
confining the Arab population to native reservations. This is the essence of the Allon
Plan, first formulated in the late 1960s and the operative framework of the Oslo process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s partial withdrawal option fell afoul, however, of the
international consensus that formed after the June 1967 war for resolving the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Embodied in U.N. Resolution 242, this consensus called for a full Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab land in exchange for an Arab commitment to full peace with
Israel. It bears recalling that the root of Israel&#146;s enduring quarrel with the
international community has been the demand not for a Palestinian state but for full, as
against partial, withdrawal. Indeed, 242 made no mention at all of a Palestinian state,
referring merely to a &#147;just settlement of the refugee problem.&#148; The Allon Plan
is not incompatible with a Palestinian state: what to call the arid patches of land ceded
to the Arab natives is a matter of semantics. For Israel, the crux has always been its
claim to &#147;territorial revision&#148; (Abba Eban).7</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the June war, Israel called for partial withdrawal on all the Arab
fronts. Egypt offered in February, 1971, to sign a bilateral peace treaty if Israel fully
withdrew from the Sinai. Israel refused. In the name of &#147;security,&#148; it demanded
retention of part of Sinai, Moshe Dayan famously declaring that, &#147;we prefer
Sharm-el-Shaykh without peace to peace without Sharm-el-Shaykh.&#148; Once Egypt proved
itself a military force to reckon with in the October 1973 war, Israel came around,
agreeing at Camp David in 1978 to the peace terms it rejected in 1971. A core Zionist
tenet, Zeev Sternhell observes, is &#147;never giving up a position or a territory unless
one is compelled to by a superior force.&#148; Israel did continue to bargain hard at Camp
David, demanding (unsuccessfully) to retain control of the oil refineries, settlements,
and airfields it had built in Sinai. Yet Sharm-el-Shaykh figured not at all in these
intense, often bitter, negotiations. Israel abandoned Sharm-el-Shaykh &#151; its crucial
&#147;security&#148; asset &#151; without even a whimper. It is an instructive lesson in
the substance, or lack thereof, of Israel&#146;s &#147;security&#148; concerns.8</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Confronting, in the first years of the intifada, the compound force of
Palestinian civil resistance and widespread international outrage, Israel considered the
prospect of full withdrawal. But the challenge to Israeli power soon receded. As the
intifada lost momentum, a concatenation of events &#151; Iraq&#146;s destruction in the
Gulf War, the demise of the Soviet bloc, the open alignment of the Arab regimes with the
United States, the PLO&#146;s precipitously declining fortunes &#151; convinced Arafat to
cut a deal with Israel, accepting partial withdrawal in exchange for the trappings of
statehood. The PLO&#146;s capitulation at Oslo did not result from political ineptitude.
Uri Savir&#146;s account of the negotiations shows that the Palestinian negotiators did,
at every crucial juncture in the Oslo process, raise the right objections. The problem
was, they had no power.9</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once Arafat conceded, as he effectively did at Oslo, that the West Bank
and Gaza were &#147;disputed territories,&#148; both sides having equal title,10 it was
inevitable that, in the ensuing battle over percentages, a 50-50 split would be held up as
the legitimate &#147;compromise.&#148; Yet Netanyahu deserves the lion&#146;s share of
credit for recasting public discourse. By tenaciously claiming that Israel had title to
all and Palestinians to none of the West Bank, Netanyahu turned any withdrawal into an
Israeli concession. Who could then expect Israel to &#147;give away&#148; more than 50
percent of &#147;its&#148; land for peace? Before Netanyahu, full withdrawal in exchange
for full peace was the legitimate compromise, Labor&#146;s partial withdrawal the
illegitimate one; after Netanyahu, partial withdrawal in exchange for full peace became
the legitimate compromise, zero withdrawal the illegitimate one. Redefining the poles of
debate with his pugnacious theatrics, Netanyahu has effectively legitimized the Labor
Party&#146;s rejectionist stance, in the process also managing to &#147;lower,&#148; as he
put it, &#147;the level of Palestinian expectations.&#148; Apart from
&#147;extremists,&#148; no one any longer speaks about full withdrawal. Indeed, the call
for full withdrawal is now equated with the call for zero withdrawal, as pundits condemn
the &#147;extremists on both sides.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>1</strong> For the percentage Arab minority in a Jewish state, cf.
Nur Masalha, <i>Expulsion of the Palestinians</i> (Washington, D.C.: 1992), p. 199. The
Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann maintained that every state reached a &#147;saturation
level,&#148; beyond which it couldn&#146;t accommodate an alien population; cf. <i>Trial
and Error</i> (New York: 1949), pp. 90, 161-2, 274, 384. The locution &#147;mainstream
Zionist movement&#148; refers to the political spectrum ranging from the left-wing of the
Labor movement to the right-wing of the Revisionist movement. Indeed as Sasson
Sofer&#146;s study, <i>Zionism and the Foundations of Israeli Diplomacy</i> (Cambridge:
1998) demonstrates, on fundamental questions bearing on the &#147;Arab question,&#148;
there was near-complete consensus in the Zionist movement. Thus all parties agreed on the
Jewish people&#146;s &#147;historic right&#148; to Palestine, support for Britain&#146;s
imperial mandate, the &#147;reactionary&#148; nature of Arab resistance, the ultimate
reliance on and legitimacy of brute force to resolve the conflict, etc. This consensus was
unbroken even after Israel&#146;s founding; for example, on Ben-Gurion&#146;s concealed
development of nuclear weapons, Avner Cohen reports: &#147;All the Zionist parties quietly
supported the project as a sacred national insurance policy,&#148; <i>Israel and the Bomb</i>

1930s, France&#146;s Socialist government and even much of European Jewish public opinion
supported the &#147;population transfer&#148; of Jews to French-controlled Madagascar to
solve Poland&#146;s &#147;Jewish problem&#148; (cf. Saul Friedlander, <i>Nazi Germany and
the Jews,</i> New York: 1997), p. 219; Philippe Burrin reports that &#147;even Roosevelt
had come out in favour of a Jewish settlement in Angola&#148; <i>Hitler and the Jews</i>
(New York: 1994), pp. 60-1. The precedent cited most frequently by the Zionist movement
was the Greek-Turkish &#147;population exchange.&#148; Eventually the &#147;population
transfer&#148; of Arabs from Palestine won the support of the British Labor party and even
Bertrand Russell (cf. Masalha, <i>passim</i>, and Bertrand Russell, &#147;The Role of the

leadership and General Staff &#151; Ben-Gurion, Yigal Allon, Moshe Dayan, etc. &#151; all

over the entire Land of Israel and to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state in
any part of that territory&#148; (p. 151).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>6 </strong>&#147;During the first months after the Six Day

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">An Interview With Shaykh Faisal Mawlawi</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shaykh Faisal Mawlawi, the Chairman of Lebanon&#146;s Islamic <i>Jama`ah</i>,
underscores the necessity of comparative jurisprudence (<i>fiqh al-muwazanat</i>) when
dealing with many issues related to the Islamic presence in the West, especially when it
comes to the traditional jurisprudential classification of the world into an Islamic realm
and a battlefield realm. He considers it timely to develop this concept in light of the
West&#146;s status as a realm of accord and missionary activity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He explains some sensitive concepts of problematic implications for
Muslims living in the West, such as <i>al-muwalat</i> (allegiance) and <i>al-tashabbuh bi
al-kuffar</i> (adopting kafer manners and means), which in a full-fledged Islamic way of
life are prohibited. He adds that a Muslim should gauge his interest in &#147;spreading
the word&#148; of Islam while living in the West as opposed to maintaining the identity of
his children, even if that means relocating into an Islamic country. He also says a
cost-benefit analysis should be considered between marrying a scriptural woman to obtain
legal residency or citizenship and the possible advantages or disadvantages of such a
marriage. What follows is the text of the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the Muslims living in the West there is a heated discussion about
the traditional fiqhi classification of the world into an abode of Islam and an abode of
war, which carries on to varying comments about the presence of Muslims in the West as
well as their social interactions. All this back-and-forth debate is presumably based upon
Islamic legal theories and practice. How could this historical fiqhi classification be
brought up to date in light of Muslims residing in the West?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The classification of the world into an Islamic domain and a hostile
domain has been one of the most contentious classifications among Muslim legal scholars.
This is true at the definitional level of each camp, and it is also true for those who
added another domain: <i>dar al`Ahd </i>(the jurisdiction of trust). This is any area of
the world that enters into a trust arrangement with the Muslims. My opinion is that the
traditional bi-polar interpretation is no longer valid in our age and time. The Islamic
portion of the world no longer meets the qualifications outlined by the `ulema, prominent
among which is the implementation of Islamic laws and practices. And according to such
(traditional) classification those countries that are assumed to be war-areas no longer
meet the original qualifications. The fact is, most Muslims living in these
&#147;war-areas&#148; feel secure in their life and possessions. Further, Muslims in these
areas are not subject to pressures to renounce their Islam, as may have been the case in
the past.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am inclined to say that all countries inhabited by Muslims should be
considered an Islamic domain even if Islamic laws and procedures are not implemented. The
&#147;hostile realm,&#148; I think, should be confined to non-Islamic countries or
countries that are in a state of war with the Muslims such as Israel in occupied
Palestine. The rest of the territories in the world qualify for the &#147;jurisdiction of
trust&#148; concept. The reason is that there are many agreements and arrangements between
the states of these territories and Muslim states through the United Nations. These states
are not - by any definition - concerned with the application of Islamic laws. I am
inclined to say that these areas-of-trust should be considered an open field of <i>da`wah </i>for
those who carry Allah&#146;s faith. This concept can extend to include all the countries
of the world even if they are not in a state of &#147;understanding&#148; with the
Muslims. This jurisdiction would gain a status similar to the one which the Muslims
experienced in pre-Medinan Mecca with respect to Muslims socializing with others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some Muslims living in the West try to justify legal irregularities such
as not paying their taxes by saying that the West is in a state of war or is considered
hostile territory (dar al-harb). They cite a legal opinion of Abu Hanifah which says that
contracts or transactions between Muslims and belligerent citizens living external to the
Islamic political order are null and void. Could you shed some light on this opinion of
Abu Hanifah concerning such contracts in light of Muslims who live in the West.</p>

<blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Hanifah &#151; may Allah be pleased with him &#151; divides the world
into two spheres: one Islamic, the other belligerent. He does not apply to the belligerent
area of the world the same legal considerations that other <i>faqihs </i>do. The Hanafi
school of thought permits a Muslim to relocate peacefully within the belligerent sphere of
the world; in this case and according to the Hanafi interpretation of Islamic laws a
Muslim must abide by the laws of that non-Islamic land. A Muslim is also expected to
transact and &#147;make money&#148; in all legal ways within this hostile area. The Muslim
is not permitted to act in any dishonorable manner.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The point of contention in the Hanafi denomination concerns generating
wealth through contracts considered valid by non-Muslims but considered invalid by Muslim
standards, such as usurious transactions. Even this type of opinion restricts its
adherents from being involved in any cheating or betrayal. Whatever transaction takes
place between a Muslim and a non-Muslim in non-Islamic territoriality should be done by
the consent of both sides. Therefore, there is nothing in the Hanafi school of thought
that would sanction a Muslim who has entered peacefully into the (Western) non-Islamic
hemisphere by obtaining a visa to turn around and carry on illegal and unlawful activities
financial or otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How can we remain obedient to secular laws and Islamic laws if they clash?
For example, Western laws prohibit having more than one wife, but Islam permits it with
restrictions. How can we counterpoise ourselves in such a situation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no problem when there is an Islamic law that permits something
and another secular law that bans it, because a Muslim may or may not partake of the
&#147;extra-legal&#148; (<i>al-mubah</i>). <b>Once a Muslim moves into the West he
(implicitly) agrees to forego the <i>mubah</i> which is outlawed in that particular
country. </b>So far so good. The problem, though, is when a Muslim is duty-bound to his
Islamic responsibility which is legally banned by the host country. This is what happened
concerning the <i>hijab</i> in France. When Muslim girls/women wanted to live by their
conscience and standard by wearing their <i>hijab</i> they were barred from French
government-run schools.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These types of problems are quite rare. The only incident I can recall is
this <i>hijab</i> issue. <b>It is obvious that when secular and Islamic laws collide, a
Muslim is expected to honor his Islamic law whenever possible.</b> Whenever a Muslim finds
himself in a &#147;legal bind&#148; he should choose the less detrimental, as Allah says:
Be observant of Allah to the best of your ability (<i>fa-ittaqu Allaha ma istata`tum</i>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There seems to be an age-old debate about the validity of women covering
the face. How can we redress this with Muslim women living in the West?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>This issue has vibrated with scholarly differences past and present. I
tend to believe that uncovering the face is perfectly valid. It is preferable for women to
cover their faces in Islamic countries because such behavior in Islamic countries is
well-thought-of and respected. In non-Islamic countries I would say that it suffices for
Muslim women to wear their <i>hijab </i>without covering their face, which in these
countries is less eye-catching than to cover the face. Besides, the image of Islam is
better served in such societies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Divine law has permitted marriage with people of the Book. Some Muslims
prefer to get married to Europeans in order to avoid falling into sin and also to obtain
legal status in the country of residence. Do you think that this in the long run is not to
the Muslim&#146;s advantage, especially when children come into the family? Or do you
consider this a wholesome approach in as far as it helps to acquaint people with Islam in
the West?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, marrying women of the Book is, Islamically speaking, legal, if
they are chaste, even if the civil benefits of legal residency were not to accrue from
such a marriage. If this concern is a &#147;fringe benefit&#148; of such a marriage then
so much the better. Problems, though, begin to grow when children come into the picture
from such marriages. These children have to be nurtured and educated. In some cases the
strain tugs at the children and then at the husband-wife relationship. These cases have to
be judged on a one-by-one basis. Sometimes, the husband needs a legal status in such a
country because he no longer can return to his (Muslim) country of origin as he is wanted
by the authorities for political opposition. If he returns he faces a death threat!
Sometimes, marriage is the only way to obtain the host country&#146;s citizenship. This is
an obvious concern that has to be weighed against the problems of having children. In some
cases it would be possible to prefer marriage to a Scriptural wife instead of projecting
what the outcome of rearing the children might be, especially if the wife is of a moral
character. Chances are she may choose Islam by conviction and the family rearing would no
longer pose a problem. But if there is no reason for obtaining citizenship in a foreign
country and no reason to get married to a Scriptural wife, then the future children become
the priority and a Muslim is instructed not to get married to a Scriptural woman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Concerning the issue of raising children in the West, how can a Muslim
find an accommodation between his fear of his children assimilating into the West and
losing their Islamic character, which would have him think about returning to his country
of origin, and the desire to establish an Islamic presence in the West?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The purpose of teaching Islam is an Islamic requirement for residing in a
non-Muslim country. Muslim families in such a context are obviously vulnerable. The
determining factor would depend on the person involved, his country of origin, and his
country of residence. <b>Some Muslims may come from countries whose moral standards and
practices are as bad as they are in his Western country of residence, if not worse. He may
be living in a European country with many Islamic institutions that help contribute to his
and his family&#146;s moral and social betterment, such as mosques, Islamic centers, and
Islamic schools. This type of person may want to stay on and spread the word of Allah. But
if circumstances are adverse then it may be better to leave and return home. </b>If one
must choose, preserving one&#146;s family takes precedence over trying to win over
converts to Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Ahmed Yousef and Caroline F. Keeble</b><i></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Review by Dr. Robert D. Crane</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This book identifies the sources and motives of those who have worked
tirelessly to portray Muslims and their political participation in the United States as
terrorist in nature and their beliefs as extreme. This book should dispel the false images
that have been created by the pro-Israeli propagandists critiqued in its 120 fact-filled
pages. The amount of fear created by these propagandists has divided America. That we have
reacted to this fear so dramatically and with few if any questions shows the power of a
single special interest group, well-funded and organized, to subvert American freedoms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist propagandists are also dividing the Muslim community by
exploiting the American-born Muslims who warn against the doctrinal extremism, cultural
baggage, and uncharitable behavior of many foreign-born Muslims. This extremism is a
threat to the purity of Islam and to the wisdom and spiritual strength that traditionalist
Islam can bring to the solution of America&#146;s problems. The Zionist lobby exploits the
warnings of the Muslims against the extremists in their midst by equating extremism with
terrorism. They cite the Muslim internal debate as proof that Islam is inherently
extremist and that Muslim extremists are inherently terrorist. This is not only dishonest
but diabolic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This vulnerability of Muslims to external exploitation, of course, is
their own fault. For centuries, Islamic law has provided an etiquette or methodology for
Muslims to discuss their internal differences. These techniques, known collectively as <i>ikhtilaf,</i>
are designed to promote constructive engagement, not open warfare, in dealing with
legitimate differences on doctrinal details, on the application of the <i>ahkam</i> or
legal rules of the <i>shari&#146;ah, </i>and on the various methodologies of deriving
principles from the basic sources. The rules of <i>ikhtilaf </i>should be observed also,
and perhaps especially, on political differences, which are inevitable and healthy in any
free society, including differences over the degree to which Muslims can or should
cooperate with non-Muslim governments and officials, both friendly and hostile, and over
Muslims&#146; own definitions of controversial terms, like extremism, militancy, and
terror. Failure even to address the terms of discussion exposes some Muslims to
misunderstanding by others, as well as to exploitation by those hostile non-Muslims who
are looking for opportunities to co-opt Muslims against the interests of the Muslim
community and against the Islamic commitment to peace through justice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before Muslims begin to refute the allegations that have so tarnished
perceptions of Islamic life and ideals, both Muslims and American opinion leaders should
first become aware that something very un-American is going on. This book identifies who
is doing what, and why.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This book is dedicated &#147;In Memory of Baby Salaam.&#148; This child
was born prematurely and later died as a result of the terror experiences by his mother
who was home alone when a hysterical mob of Americans attacked their Oklahoma City home
only hours after Steven Emerson announced on the CBS Evening News that the Oklahoma City
bombing was carried out by Muslims. This book is designed to provide relief along with
education. In dedicating the book to Baby Salaam, the authors make it clear that Muslims
and Arabs will be glad to know that what they have suspected all along is true and
verifiable. According to the authors, one of the primary objectives of this media
campaign, or hoax, is the defense of Israel&#146;s image in the West as a victim of savage
Muslim terrorists and Israel&#146;s desire to employ the American people as allies in its
continued illegal occupation of Palestine. Muslims and Arabs have been saying this all
along.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The authors warn that the nightmare is sure to continue as long as the
Zionist zealots go unchallenged in their assertions about terrorist threats in the United
States, and are allowed to manipulate and mock American patriotism while using Muslims who
are also citizens of this country like magnets to attract fears and hatreds. This
nightmare will end when the real enemies of freedom and democracy stop using patriotic
rhetoric to fleece American taxpayers of billions each year in support of the illegal and
immoral occupation of a sovereign people and their land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the authors, Muslim Americans have been prevented access to
the media, which has kept them from answering the charges levied against them. As the
anti-Muslim campaign has raged in America, taxpayer money to Israel has increased and our
civil liberties have decreased. Even the U.S. Supreme Court joined the campaign when it
voted to turn the United States into a legal trap for Muslims and Arabs by providing the
courts, and jails, and police power to hunt down Muslims and Arab activists domestically
and internationally, imprisoning and silencing them, even if they are American citizens,
and at American taxpayer expense. A most dangerous example of this direction was the
Supreme Court ruling in 1998 that Americans cannot utilize the 5th Amendment to the
Constitution in their defense against acts considered crimes in foreign countries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This year the Supreme Court ruled that resident aliens do not have
Constitutional rights and that they can be targeted and imprisoned based on the use of
secret evidence because of their political and religious ideals and beliefs. All of these
judicial decisions have been handed down to protect what Steven Emerson and Daniel Pipes
call the &#147;greatest democracy in the world,&#148; while at the same time they claim
that our Constitution prevents us from being able to fight terrorism effectively. The
strangest thing about all of this is that we have been dismantling the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights by accommodating their ideas, even though the acts of terrorism that
they frighten us with have yet to occur and most likely will never occur, considering that
Muslims are not likely to do anything that would corroborate the charges thus far made
against them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are more than eight million Muslims in the United States, of whom
60% are indigenous American citizens whose ancestors have lived in America for more than
two centuries. This fact alone makes Emerson&#146;s thesis that Muslims in America are
driven by hatred of the United States to perform terrorist acts incomprehensible. Most
Muslims are Americans, from both Africa and Europe, and their history as Americans
predates the great Jewish migration to the United States in the early 1900&#146;s.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Foreword to the book, Richard Curtiss, Editor in Chief of the <i>Washington
Report on Middle East Affairs</i>, summarizes the problem when he says, &#147;In addition
to being the catalyst for hundreds of attacks on innocent Muslim Americans and their
property in many parts of the United States, Emerson and his ilk already have done lasting
damage to the credibility of the United States and its legal system.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To the extent that there can be a terrorist threat to American cities in
the future, this will result only from the Zionists&#146; absolute refusal to even
consider the causes of terrorism, namely, the injustices that they themselves support. At
one of the monthly roundtable discussions at the United Association for Studies and
Research, on March 21, 1999, Ambassador Edward L. Peck, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq,
related his experiences representing the State Department under President Bush as Deputy
Director of the Cabinet Task Force on Terrorism. The members of the task force were told
that they had absolute authority and unlimited access to all the documents and people they
wanted concerning terrorism, with one exception. This exception, Ambassador Peck revealed,
was <i>that they were not ever or in any way to address terrorism&#146;s causes.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Reading this book, one comes quickly to the conclusion that the authors
have not spun a web of conspiracy, but have thoroughly documented the reality that there
has indeed been a tremendous amount of time and money dedicated to terrorizing America by
demonizing Muslims and Islam. The authors&#146; attempts to answer the obvious questions
&#147;why and how all of this could happen&#148; are not as powerful as their
documentation that at times the foreign loyalties of some of our journalists and scholars
take priority over their concern for American laws and traditions. The authors reveal by
name the sources of funding for pro-Zionist political operations in America and the extent
to which they use the American media to promote hatred and fear of one of America&#146;s
many minorities, which by any analysis is anathema to the true American spirit.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That America&#146;s conservative funding institutions, think-tanks, and
intellectuals have fallen prey to such propaganda and have funded and promoted its
proliferation into Congress, where it has led to legislation that impedes the rights of
citizens, is tragic, since as the authors say in this book, &#147;American conservatism
has traditionally served as the custodian of national sovereignty and American Christian
values.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The analysis of institutions, project by project, that have funded this
media hoax shows just how serious and how dangerous to our liberty the Zionist
protagonists might be. They include many of the nation&#146;s leading blue-ribbon
foundations, including Sarah Scaife, Carthage, Olin, Lynde and Harry Bradley, and
Heritage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The list of players and the specific dollar amounts of funding for each of
their projects is more telling and includes such high-profile persons as Daniel Pipes,
Judith Miller, Steven Emerson, Yousef Bodansky, Samuel Huntington, and Michael Horowitz.
The media that have brought the anti-Muslim terror into our homes include <i>PBS</i>, the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i>, and <i>U. S. News and World Report</i>. This list includes many of
America&#146;s local papers that picked up syndicated columns written by those mentioned.
Such titles as <i>Political Islam Promotes Terror</i> and <i>Get Ready for Twenty World
Trade Center Bombings</i> have appeared in the living rooms and boardrooms of America for
almost a decade. For the most part the mis-information they contain has gone unchallenged,
until now.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For a political scientist and observer of both American thought and
American politics, perhaps the most important part of this book, <i>The Agent</i>, is its
analysis of the conservative movement in America and its three parts. Two are objective
and independent, but the third, the neo-conservatives, were and still are liberals who
became conservative in name only because the liberals of the Vietnam era rejected Zionist
oppression of the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The authors of this book quote one of the eminent students of
conservatism, Dr. Antony Sullivan of the Earhart Foundation, who writes that, &#147;Anyone
believing that there is any cohesive, homogeneous &#145;conservatism&#146; in
contemporary, post Cold War America is making a serious mistake. There are in fact several
competing conservatisms. &#133; The three tribes are the neo-conservatives, the
paleo-conservatives, and the classical liberals. The latter two are potentially friendly
to Muslims and to the contemporary Islamic revival.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Through a generation of careful orchestration of money and manpower, the
neo-conservatives have gone far toward their goal of taking over the entire conservative
movement in the cause of secular Zionism, despite the fact that rabid secularism of any
sort is precisely what the original conservative movement, known as traditionalism, for
two centuries has been trying to combat. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists are pitting the American people against each other, the
Muslims against other Muslims, and the intellectuals of Western civilization against their
own principles. This may be good tactics over the short-run, but as a strategy it is
suicidal because its exposure to the light of day will cause an inevitable backlash.
Inevitably the American people will discover the evil behind secular Zionism&#146;s mask
and call for American foreign policy that promotes not the ethnic cleansing of
Palestinians but the enlightened American interest in peace through justice for all
peoples everywhere.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Laws Against Non-Jews</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Part 18</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Israel Shahak</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The laws against doing work on the sabbath apply to a lesser extent on
other holy days. In particular, on a holy day which does not happen to fall on a Saturday
it is permitted to do any work required for preparing food to be eaten during the holy
days or days. Legally, this is defined as preparing a &#145;soul&#146;s food&#146;<i>; </i>but
&#145;soul&#146; is interpreted to mean &#145;Jew&#146;, and &#145;Gentiles and dogs&#146;
are explicitly excluded.<sup> </sup></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An important effect of all these laws - quite apart from their application
in practice - is in the attitude created by their constant study which, as part of the
study of the Halakhah, is regarded by classical Judaism as a supreme religious duty. Thus
an Orthodox Jew learns from his earliest youth, as part of his sacred studies, that
Gentiles are compared to dogs, that it is a sin to praise them, and so on and so forth. As
a matter of fact, in this respect, textbooks for beginners have a worse effect than the
Talmud and the great talmudic codes. One reason for this is that such elementary texts
give more detailed explanations, phrased so as to influence young and uneducated minds.
Out of a large number of such texts, I have chosen the one which is currently most popular
in Israel and has been reprinted in many cheap editions, heavily subsidised by the Israeli
government. It is The <i>Book of Education, </i>written by an anonymous rabbi in early 14<sup>th</sup>
century Spain. It explains the 613 religious obligations <i>(mitzvot) </i>of Judaism in
the order in which they are supposed to be found in the Pentateuch according to the
talmudic interpretation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A central didactic aim of this book is to emphasise the
&#145;correct&#146; meaning of the Bible with respect to such terms as &#145;fellow&#146;,
&#145;friend&#146; or &#145;man&#146; (which we have referred to in Chapter 3). Thus
§219, devoted to the religious obligation arising from the verse &#145;thou shalt love
thy fellow as thyself, is entitled: &#145;A religious obligation to love Jews&#146;, and
explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">To love every Jew strongly means that we should care for a Jew and his
  money just as one cares for oneself and one&#146;s own money, for it is written:
  &#145;thou shalt love thy fellow as thyself and our sages of blessed memory said:
  &#145;what is hateful to you do not do to your friend&#146; ..and many other religious
  obligations follow from this, because one who loves one&#146;s friend as oneself will not
  steal his money, or commit adultery with his wife, or defraud him of his money, or deceive
  him verbally, or steal his land, or harm him in any way. Also many other religious
  obligations depend on this, as is known to any reasonable man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In §322, dealing with the <i>duty </i>to keep a Gentile slave enslaved
for ever (whereas a Jewish slave must be set free after seven years), the following
explanation is given:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">And at the root of this religious obligation [is the fact that] the Jewish
  people are the best of the human species, created to know their Creator and worship Him,
  and worthy of having slaves to serve them. And if they will not have slaves of other
  peoples, they would have to enslave their brothers, who would thus be unable to serve the
  Lord, blessed be He. Therefore, we are commanded to possess those for our service, after
  they are prepared for this and after idolatory is removed from their speech so that there
  should not be danger in our houses, and this is the intention of the verse &#145;but over
  your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with
  rigour&#146;, so that you will not have to enslave your brothers, who are all ready to
  worship God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In §545, dealing with the religious obligation to exact interest on money
lent to Gentiles, the law is stated as follows: &#145;That we are commanded to demand
interest from Gentiles when we lend money to them, and we must not lend to them without
interest,&#146; The explanation is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">And at the root of this religious obligation is that we should not do any
  act of mercy except to the people who know God and worship Him; and when we refrain from
  doing merciful deed to the rest of mankind and do so only to the former, we are being
  tested that the main part of love and mercy to them is because they follow the religion of
  God, blessed be He. Behold, with this intention our reward [from God] when we withhold
  mercy from the others is equal to that for doing merciful deeds] to members of our own
  people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similar distinctions are made in numerous other passages. In explaining
the ban against delaying a worker&#146;s wage (§238) the author is careful to point out
that the sin is less serious if the worker is Gentile. The prohibition against cursing
(§239) is entitled &#145;Not to curse any Jew, whether man or woman&#146;. Similarly, the
prohibitions against giving misleading advice, hating other people, shaming them or taking
revenge on them (§§240, 245,246, 247) apply only to fellow-Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ban against following Gentile customs (§262) means that Jews must not
only &#145;remove themselves&#146; from Gentiles, but also &#145;speak ill of all their
behaviour, even of their dress&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It must be emphasised that the explanations quoted above do represent
correctly the teaching of the Halakhah. The rabbis and, even worse, the apologetic
&#145;scholars of Judaism&#146; know this very well and for this reason they do not try to
argue against such views inside the Jewish community; and of course they never mention
them outside it. Instead, they vilify any Jew who raises these matters within earshot of
Gentiles, and they issue deceitful denials in which the art of equivocation reaches its
summit. For example, they state, using general terms, the importance which Judaism
attaches to mercy; but what they forget to point out is that according to the Halakhah
&#145;mercy means mercy towards Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyone who lives in Israel knows how deep and widespread these attitudes
of hatred and cruelty to towards all Gentiles are among the majority of Israeli Jews.
Normally these attitudes are disguised from the outside world, but since the establishment
of the State of Israel, the 1967 war and the rise of Begin, a significant minority of
Jews, both in Israel and abroad, have gradually become more open about such matters. In
recent years the inhuman precepts according to which servitude is the &#145;natural&#146;
lot of Gentiles have been publicly quoted in Israel, even on TV, by Jewish farmers
exploiting Arab labour, particularly child labour. Gush Emunim leaders have quoted
religious precepts which enjoin Jews to oppress Gentiles, as a justification of the
attempted assassination of Palestinian mayors and as divine authority for their own plan
to expel all the Arabs from Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While many Zionists reject these positions politically, their standard
counter-argument<sub> </sub>are based on considerations of expediency and Jewish
self-interest, rather than on universally valid principles of humanism and ethics. For
example, they argue that the exploitation and oppression of Palestinians by Israelis tends
to corrupt Israeli society, or that the expulsion of the Palestinians is impracticable
under present political conditions, or that Israeli acts of terror against the
Palestinians tend to isolate Israel internationally. In principle, however, virtually all
Zionists and in particular &#145;left&#146; zionists - share the deep anti-Gentile
attitudes which Orthodox Judaism keenly promotes.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Attitudes to Christianity and Islam</b></i><br>
In the foregoing, several examples of the rabbinical attitudes to these two religions were
given in passing. But it will be useful to summarise these attitudes here.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Judaism is imbued with a very deep hatred towards Christianity, combined
with ignorance about it. This attitude was clearly aggravated by the Christian
persecutions of Jews, but is largely independent of them. In fact, it dates from the time
when Christianity was still weak and persecuted (not least by Jews), and it was shared by
Jews who had never been persecuted by Christians or who were even helped by them. Thus,
Maimonides was subjected to Muslim persecutions by the regime of the Almohads and escaped
from them first to the crusaders&#146; Kingdom of Jerusalem, but this did not change his
views in the least. This deeply negative attitude is based on two main elements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, on hatred and malicious slanders against Jesus. The traditional
view of Judaism on Jesus must of course be sharply distinguished from the nonsensical
controversy between antisemites and Jewish apologists concerning the
&#145;responsibility&#146; for his execution (according to the Christian belief-editor).
Most modern scholars of that period admit that due to the lack of original and
contemporary accounts, the late composition of the Gospels and the contradictions between
them, accurate historical knowledge of the circumstances of &#147;Jesus&#146;
execution&#148; is not available. In any case, the notion of collective and inherited
guilt is both wicked and absurd. However, what is at issue here is not the actual facts
about Jesus, but the inaccurate and even slanderous reports in the Talmud and
post-talmudic literature - which is what Jews believed until the 19<sup>th</sup> century
and many, especially in Israel, still believe. For these reports certainly played an
important role in forming the Jewish attitude to Christianity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Talmud, Jesus was executed by a proper rabbinical court
for idolatry, inciting other Jews to idolatry, and contempt of rabbinical authority. All
classical Jewish sources which mention his execution are quite happy to take
responsibility for it; in the talmudic account the Romans are not even mentioned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The more popular accounts - which were nevertheless taken quite seriously
- such as the notorious <i>Toldot Yeshu </i>are even worse, for in addition to the above
crimes they accuse him of witchcraft. The very name Jesus&#146; was for Jews a symbol of
all that is abominable, and this popular tradition still persists. The Gospels are equally
detested, and they are not allowed to be quoted (let alone taught) even in modern Israeli
Jewish schools.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Secondly, for theological reasons, mostly rooted in ignorance,
Christianity as a religion is classed by rabbinical teaching as idolatry. This is based on
a crude interpretation of the Christian doctrines on the Trinity and Incarnation. All the
Christian emblems and pictorial representations are regarded as &#145;idols&#146; - even
by those Jews who literally worship scrolls, stones or personal belongings of &#145;Holy
Men&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attitude of Judaism towards Islam is, in contrast, relatively mild.
Although the stock epithet given to Muhammad is &#145;madman&#146; <i>(&#145;mesbugga&#146;),
</i>this was not nearly as offensive as it may sound now, and in any case it pales before
the abusive terms applied to Jesus. Similarly, the Qur&#146;an - unlike the New Testament
- is not condemned to burning. Most rabbinical authorities agree that Islam is <i>not </i>idolatry
(although some leaders of Gush Emunim now choose to ignore this). Therefore, the Halakhah
decrees that Muslims should not be treated by Jews any worse than &#145;ordinary&#146;
Gentiles. But also, no better. Again, Maimonides can serve as an illustration. He
explicitly states that Islam is not idolatry, and in his philosophical works he quotes,
with great respect, many Islamic philosophical authorities. He was, as I have mentioned
before, personal physician to Saladin and his family, and by Saladin&#146;s order he was
appointed Chief over all Egypt&#146;s Jews. Yet, the rules he lays down against saving a
Gentile&#146;s life (except in order to avert danger to Jews) apply equally to Muslims.</p>
