<P><CENTER><B><BIG><BIG>Arabs must possess nuclear capability
for survival</BIG></BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><BR>
The Pakistani nuclear tests, which were carried out two months
ago in reaction to similar Indian tests that took place two weeks
earlier, provided a glimmer of hope for a more secure future for
hundreds of millions of Muslims in the Middle East and West Asia.
Some people even opine with little exaggeration that the tests
were the most important development in the Muslim world since
the downfall of the Ottoman State in 1924.</P>

<P>It is true that the lethal and destructive nature of the bomb
is inherently incompatible with the lofty ideals of Islam, which
prefer life over death and construction over destruction. However,
since we live in reality and not in fantasy, and since the ethics
of brutal force prevail over the ethics of morality, it is politically
and morally imperative that Muslims possess the necessary means
to protect themselves against the haunting spectre of annihilation,
either at the hands of the malignant and pugnacious Zionist entity,
called Israel, or any other actual or potential predators.</P>

<P>This &quot;dangerous vulnerability&quot; to a prospective nuclear
holocaust by the Zionists is not a phobia or an exaggerated fear
of a nonexistent danger on the part of Arab-Muslim masses. It
is rather a plainly real fear and therefore justified anxiety,
as amply demonstrated by the wanton Zionist threats against Muslims
in Lebanon and Palestine. Indeed, what guarantees does a given
Muslim country, say Egypt or Iran, have against the possibility
of being hit by an Israeli nuclear bomb? The answer is none. </P>

<P>In the New (American) World Order, the United Nations has virtually
become just another tool of American foreign policy. And the United
States itself happens to be in the throes of Jewish domination,
given the fact that all influential decision makers in the Clinton
Administration (with the exception of Clinton himself) are ardent
Zionist Jews. The Congress of the United States is more responsible
to the Jewish lobby than to the American people. </P>

<P>So, no responsible Arab or Muslim leader should be too gullible
or too stupid to expect the American monkey to shield the Muslim
masses from the real nuclear threats of the Zionist organ-grinder.
Therefore, we must not be oblivious of the possibility that someday
the Zionists would drop an atomic bomb or two on an Arab or Muslim
capital, incinerating hundreds of thousands of Muslim men, women
and children. How would the international community react to such
a possibility-turned-reality? The answer lies in the numerous
UN resolutions against Israeli aggression and the countless times
the U.S. used its veto power to shield Zionist insolence.</P>

<P>This means that Muslims must strive to achieve a state of deterrence
vis-&agrave;-vis Israel, through some form of &quot;mutual assured
destruction&quot; or &quot;MAD.&quot;</P>

<P>The successful Pakistani efforts to level with India deserve
our admiration and support. Indeed, it is quite admirable for
a poor third world Muslim country with limited natural resources
to challenge American-Israeli hegemony and successfully carry
out five nuclear tests. The Pakistani feat is a striking example
of how the dignity of Muslims ought to be upheld irrespective
of variable political and economic calculations. Undoubtedly,
the Pakistanis will suffer due to American and European sanctions.
However, hostile countries, some of which are dead set on destroying
Muslim Pakistan, will now think twice before extending the hand
of aggression on Pakistan.</P>

<P>As for the Arab world, if indeed such a thing exists at all
at least in the political sense, leading Arab countries such as
Egypt must give more attention to the Israeli nuclear threat next
door. The conventional arms, including the state-of-the-art modern
fighter planes, are never a match for Israel's nuclear arsenal.
Even chemical and biological weapons are no deterrent to the Israeli
nuclear arsenal.  Only a threat in-kind would match the Israeli
nuclear threat. Any other argument is only a waste of time.</P>

<P>The acquisition of a nuclear capability by Arabs and Muslims,
a matter of national survival, should not be an impossibility.
The technology itself is no longer enigmatic or confined to a
small set of countries. Indeed, if the poor Pakistanis could do
it, why can't the Arabs and the Iranians?</P>

<P>The possession of a nuclear capability by Muslims in the Middle
East would not bring Armageddon closer. Quite the contrary, it
would lessen the dangers of war by providing a counterbalance
to the Israeli nuclear arsenal. This system of &quot;MAD&quot;
worked for 40 years of cold war between the West and the former
Soviet Union, and there is no reason why it can't work in the
Middle East now. Hence, the bottom line is that Arabs and Muslims
in this region must choose between continuing to live in the shadow
of Israeli atomic bombs or developing their own deterrent. Unfortunately,
there doesn't seem to be a viable third alternative.<BR>
