to resolve Israel&#146;s demographic problem</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interpreting the relationship between the occupier and the occupied is
not always easy. Secular fundamentalists often employ a very simple rule for this purpose:
whoever controls power owns the truth. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has, nevertheless,
defied this rule. For despite their power and ability to rewrite history according to
their whims, the Zionist occupiers have failed to conceal their real intent toward the
Palestinian people. Nahum Goldmann unashamedly revealed these motives during a meeting
with British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin in 1946.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Writing in his memoirs, the former Chairman of the World Jewish
Congress recalled his surprise when Bevin threw the question at him: &#147;What exactly do
you want in Palestine?&#148; Goldmann replied: &#147;We want Palestine itself.&#148; Bevin
rejoined: &#147;Am I to understand that you want all of Palestine?&#148; Goldmann shook
his head in the affirmative. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Bevin declared:
&#147;But the Old Testament does not say this. I read the Torah and I have not found
anything in it which indicates that the Jews have the right to own all of Palestine.&#148;<sup>1</sup></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding this frank admission, the greatest challenge to the
Zionist project in Palestine was never the opposition of the former mandatory power or the
international community. It has, instead, always been the resistance of the indigenous
Palestinian Arabs. Unlike the Aztec and Maya peoples who were physically exterminated in
the Americas by their European colonizers, the Palestinians have refused to die quietly,
both in their homeland and in exile. Thus, it was for this reason the &#145;patrons of
peace&#146; undertook to renegotiate the Wye Memorandum at Sharm el-Sheikh in September
1999; making it the sixth agreement of its kind in as many years!</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Land and people</b></u><br>
Like its forerunner, the Sharm el-Sheikh<i><b> </b></i>Memorandum broke no new ground on
the road to peace. At best, it merely reaffirmed the previous agreements and sought to
ensure their implementation. Indeed, in the weeks before his last-minute trek to the
Egyptian resort, General Barak no longer spoke of &#147;peace&#148; with the Palestinians.
All his public statements were, significantly, about a &#147;permanent settlement.&#148;
Hence, without sacrificing any of the gains secured at Wye Plantation, Barak insisted that
the Netanyahu &#147;land for security&#148; formula should be transformed into a
&#147;land for permanent settlement&#148; based on the well-known conditions (of nos) that
he announced after coming to power. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In practical terms, General Barak knows, perhaps better than most
Israeli politicians, that it would be infantile to speak of a final peace with the
Palestinian people while half of their number remain exiled and stateless refugees. With
his eyes firmly fixed on his political future, he is, moreover, well aware that he has no
mandate from the Jewish electorate to change Israel&#146;s long-standing policy on the
Palestinian refugee problem. If Israeli press sources are to be believed, the public mood
in the Jewish State is nowhere nearer to accepting the Palestinian right to return. Quite
the contrary, the daily<i> Ma&#146;ariv</i> (20 September 1998) confirmed through a survey
that 65% of Israeli Jews support the expulsion of the remaining Palestinians from their
homeland. Consequently, Barak decided that the best way to overcome this obstacle was to
link the uncompleted third phase of the transitional period with the commencement of the
final status negotiations. With the conclusion of this final settlement at a date not
later than 13 September 2000, the PLO is expected to formally declare the end of the
conflict with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the event, Chairman Arafat would then be allowed to declare the
establishment of a Palestinian State in parts of the West Bank. As a sovereign State, the
government of Palestine will in theory, if nothing else, have the right to determine who
its nationals are and under what conditions the dispersed Palestinians would be allowed to
return. It will, moreover, have the authority to issue its nationals, wherever they are,
internationally recognized identity and travel documents; thereby ending their Stateless
condition and entitling them to the protection of a national authority. Whether the
issuing of these documents are accompanied with repatriation or not will eventually affect
the future shape of the refugee problem. For when the Palestinian government becomes
responsible for its nationals abroad in accordance with international law, countries like
Syria and Lebanon may well feel pressured to abandon whatever special obligations they
previously held toward the refugees, especially if Israel withdraws from their territory.
The speed with which the Israeli leader wants to conclude the final status negotiations
and his desperation to have a deal with Syria both fit into his overall strategy on the
refugee issue.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Final Status and UN Resolutions</b></u><br>
Like the Declaration of Principles upon which it is based, the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum
affirmed that both Israel and the PLO have accepted [United Nations] Security Council
resolution 242 as a basis for their negotiations on the permanent status issues, including
that of the refugees. Judging from its texts, however, this resolution holds very little
promise for the dispersed Palestinians. Legal analysts have, rightly, pointed out that
resolution 242 calls only for &#147;a just settlement of the refugee problem.&#148; It
does not stipulate their repatriation and repossession as a legal requirement. And so,
while being consistent with Israel&#146;s view that a just settlement means the
resettlement of the refugees outside of their homeland, resolution 242 does not, by
itself, uphold the Palestinian right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Faced with this built-in disadvantage in the terms of reference, the
Palestinian negotiators must, therefore, insist that the &#147;just settlement&#148;
envisaged by resolution 242 can only be realized with the return of the refugees to their
homes. Given the fact that the only authoritative principles adopted by the UN on this
subject are contained in resolution 194, they furthermore owe it to history and posterity
to ensure that this latter resolution remains the legal basis for resolving the refugee
problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the written or unwritten &#147;guarantees&#148; of the American
administration would not in any way assuage the concerns and fears of the Palestinian
refugees. Only two years ago they witnessed, much to their horror, how the letter of
assurance by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Benyamin Netanyahu was used
to subvert resolution 242 and turn the 1997 Hebron Protocol on its head. Though not
officially part of the Protocol, they were appalled by the way this document was
incorporated into the agreement to make redeployment entirely dependent upon Israeli
goodwill. The Legal Division in Israel&#146;s Foreign Ministry interpreted the
letter&#146;s statement that &#147;U.S. views on Israel&#146;s process of redeploying its
forces, designating specified military locations&#133;&#148; to mean that Washington had
ceded to Israel the right to determine unilaterally the extent of territory and size of
the forces to be redeployed.<sup>2</sup> Because of its dubious track record, therefore,
the White House would find it extremely difficult to assure the refugees that a just
settlement to their problem does not involve their resettlement in their places of refuge
or anywhere else other than Palestine. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Security versus Resistance</b></u><br>
Although they were not deemed British subjects under the mandate system, the Palestinians
were treated on the same footing as British Protected Persons until 1948. With the
creation of the Jewish State and their subsequent expulsion to the Four Corners of the
earth, they became a Stateless people as they were not considered nationals by any State
in accord with the operation of its laws. Since nationality is the principal link between
the individual, the State and international law, the Palestinians lost many of their
fundamental rights. As a Stateless people, they lost even the right to have rights. Now
with the imminent birth of a Palestinian State, it is expected that some, though not all,
of these lost rights will be restored. Human rights observers have, nonetheless, warned
that those who drafted this new agreement would be held responsible for the violation of
every Palestinian right that is committed in the name of security.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite their mutual pledge to prevent the occurrence of terror, violence
or incitement, the signatories of the Sharm el-Sheikh accord have created no mechanism to
uproot the real cause of the violence&#150;Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
Surely it was the commencement of the Jebal Abu Ghneim settlement scheme that grounded the
negotiations to a halt before the Wye I Memorandum. Accordingly, exploiting the
negotiating weakness of the Palestinians and forcing them to refer to the settlements as
&#147;Jewish areas&#148; will do nothing for the cause of peace, especially when marauding
settlers are allowed to roam the land with weapons. Since the Palestinians are denied the
right to resist the expansion of these settlements, who will protect their women and
children from being the sitting targets of trigger-happy fanatics? One need only recall
that over 1,500 Palestinians were killed during the 1987-1993 <i>Intifadah</i> and not one
Israeli soldier has served a prison sentence for these murders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tying the hands and gagging the mouths of those who resist occupation may
satisfy Israeli security needs. Yet, at the same time, it is sure to endanger Palestinian
interests. For one thing, the Israelis will view this as a signal to continue with the
Judaization of Jerusalem, expansion of settlements, seizure of land and rejection of
repatriation. This empowerment of Israel will, no doubt, further enable it to serve and
protect American strategic interests in the region. The Israeli satirist, B. Michael,
defined his country&#146;s relationship with the United States thus: &#147;My master gives
me food to eat and I bite those whom he tells me to bite. It is called strategic
cooperation.&#148;<sup>3</sup></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">People with shallow memories may only remember Sharm el-Sheikh for its
hosting of the March 1996 summit of world leaders convened to enhance peace, promote
security and combat terrorism. To the vast majority of Palestinians, though, the name
Sharm el-Sheikh has a totally different, albeit special, significance. It has nothing to
do with Wye II. Sharm el-Sheikh is a symbolic fruit of resistance. This is a strip of
territory which Israel preferred to have without peace rather than peace without it. Yet,
after the events of October 1973, it ended its occupation of this prized tract that was so
vital to its security. The Wye II accord that was revised at Sharm el-Sheikh may, in the
short term, fulfill some of Israel&#146;s security needs. In the long term, however, it
will fail to deliver peace not only because it sanctioned the continued existence of the
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories but also because it further endangered the
right of the refugees to return. </p>

</font><i><b>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In what seems to be a coordinated move, Israel, the Palestinian Authority
and the Jordanian government have separately clamped down on the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), arresting dozens of its activists and supporters in the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and Amman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the West Bank, Israeli occupation forces arrested a large number of
Islamist activists in recent weeks. Sources close to Hamas report that over 300 of the
Movement&#146;s members and sympathizers have been rounded up by the Israeli occupation
authorities since the beginning of July and imprisoned without charge or trial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the arrests took place in the Bethlehem and Hebron districts, but
others were reported in the northern part of the West Bank. The majority of those detained
are either college students affiliated with the &#147;Islamic Bloc&#148;&#151;Hamas&#146;
student wing&#151;or people associated in some way with Islamic religious, social and
educational institutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli sources have described the arrests as &#147;precautionary&#148; in
advance of the possible redeployment of Israeli troops from significant parts of the
Palestinian countryside (where most of the arrests took place).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the experience of recent years leads many to conclude that the move is
more than merely &#147;preemptive.&#148; Many of those detained have been served with long
and renewable administrative detention orders. This suggests that Israel is intent on
continuing to play the Palestinian prisoners&#146; card well into the final status
negotiations, using them as bargaining chips in future talks with the PA. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, this sinister intent was made openly clear by sources close to
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who were quoted by the Israeli English daily, the <i>Jerusalem
Post,</i> as saying that &#147;Israel must keep as many of the Palestinian prisoners as
possible in order to use them as bargaining cards in the final status talks.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority police have also arrested (and continue
to arrest) more Hamas activists in parts of the West Bank under their control. The
arrests, carried out by the Mukhabarat (General Intelligence), were also described as
&#147;precautionary,&#148; suggesting that they were linked to the implementation of the
Wye agreement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, a key feature of that agreement is
&#147;reciprocity&#148;, which translates into a stronger PA clampdown on Hamas and other
anti-Oslo organizations in exchange for Israel&#146;s fulfilling its commitment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The arrests in the West Bank coincided with the detention of a number of
Hamas leaders in Gaza, including the Movement&#146;s senior spokesman there, Abdel Aziz
Rantisi. He had been interned for 16 months before being briefly released in early July to
attend his mother&#146;s funeral. But he was re-arrested three weeks later, ostensibly for
making &#147;provocative and false statements to the media.&#148; Rantisi had told a
Gulf-based satellite TV station that &#147;my illegal imprisonment was ordered by Israel
and the CIA. All the PA did was carry out the order,&#148; and accused the PA in other
media interviews of being more answerable to Israel and the U.S. than to the Palestinian
people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An infuriated Yasser Arafat ordered the re-incarceration of Rantisi and a
number of other senior Hamas figures, including Ahmad Nimr, a prominent Friday imam who
has often spoken out forcefully against security coordination between the PA and Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The clampdown on Hamas comes at a time when Arafat is struggling to rally
the PLO&#146;s old left-wing factions&#151;namely the Popular and Democratic Fronts for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP and DFLP)&#151;behind him in advance of the final status
talks with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The coincidence of the arrests with the &#147;national dialogue&#148;
talks&#151;first in Cairo in early and mid-August, then in Ramallah on 31
August&#151;suggested Arafat was trying to co-opt the PLO factions to the exclusion of the
Islamists. No official invitation was extended to Hamas leaders to take part in the
much-vaunted &#147;dialogue&#148;, although informal overtures to that effect were three
reportedly made to some &#147;moderate&#148; individuals on the fringe of the Islamist
Movement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas itself seemed none too enthusiastic about the &#147;national
dialogue.&#148; The Movement&#146;s leaders cited their &#147;bitter experience&#148; of
such talks in the past, which failed to achieve any consensus on fundamental political
issues. Hasan Yousuf, a prominent Islamist spokesman in Ramallah, said that while Hamas
was always ready to participate in genuine dialogue aimed at &#147;delivering the
Palestinians from Oslo and its dismal aftermath&#148;, the onus was on Arafat to prove his
sincerity and that he was not seeking to manipulate the talks for his own short-term
benefit.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghaushe was more blunt: &#147;Arafat is looking
for someone to share his burden and failures for virtually nothing in return. Hamas is not
the proper address for this cynical effort.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dismissing the PA president&#146;s overtures to the opposition as a
tactical manoeuvre, Ghaushe said, &#147;If Arafat is sincere about national dialogue, he
must first free hundreds of political detainees from his jails and end his subservience to
the Zionist enemy and the CIA.&#148;</p>
<font SIZE="3"><u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Crack-down in Amman</b></u></font><br>
The Islamist Movement received its third, and most expected blow in Amman when Jordanian
plainclothes intelligence officers stormed the homes and offices of several of its leading
figures in a series of raids on 30 August. Twelve people were arrested.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, warrants were issued for the arrest of four Amman-based
members of Hamas&#146; political bureau&#151;Ghausha himself, Khalid Misha&#146;al (target
of Mossad&#146;s infamous botched 1997 assassination attempt), Khaled Nazzal and Musa Abu
Marzouq&#151;three of whom were on a visit to Iran at the time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All except Abu Marzouq, who was deported to Jordan from the U.S. in 1997,
are Jordanian nationals. Among the people arrested in the raids was Muhammed Abu Saif, the
personal bodyguard of Khalid Misha&#146;al, Chief of the Hamas Political Bureau. Abu Saif
is known to be the one who on 25 September 1997 chased and arrested the two Mossad agents
after they attacked Mr. Misha&#146;al and sprayed a mysterious poison in his ear.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The raids came a few days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albrights&#146; visit to the region and two weeks after an unpublicized visit to Amman by
Dani Yatoum, the former Mossad official who personally oversaw the attempt on
Misha&#146;al&#146;s life.</p>
<font SIZE="3"><u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Reactions</b></u></font><br>
The draconian measures against Hamas were castigated by Islamist leaders in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin described the
Jordanian measures as &#147;unjustified.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He attributed the clamp-down to American-Zionist pressure on Amman saying,
&#147;We know that Jordan is not its own master and that Jordanian officials often come
under pressure to carry out the Zionist&#146; will and demands.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In mosques throughout the occupied territories, Friday imams lashed out at
the &#147;Jordanian government&#146;s hostile steps against Hamas,&#148; describing the
closure of four Hamas offices and the detention of 12 Islamist activists as &#147;aimed
first and foremost at appeasing and pleasing the enemy of the Arabs, Islam and the
Palestinian cause.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This step shows the extent to which contemporary Arab regimes are
subservient to Zionist-American hegemony,&#148; said Sheikh Anwar Ibrahim of Nablus&#146;
Grand Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that it was clear that the United States and the Zionist regime
want the Arab regimes to crack-down on the Islamic Movement because &#147;the Islamist
camp is the last remaining line of defense in the face of Zionist-American hegemony.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;All other flags have been lowered, all other ideologies have fallen
or succumbed to defeat, except Islam, the true religion, the true ideology that won&#146;t
give in as long as there is a Muslim child who declares God is Great.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Dura, 12 miles south-west of Hebron, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub pointed out
that most Arab regimes were answerable to America and Israel, adding that &#147;their <i>raison
d&#146;être</i> is to repress and torment their peoples in the service of the
enemies.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said the servants of Israel &#147;were doing their jobs on both sides
of the River Jordan, here in the Holy Land and there in the land of <i>Ribat </i>(mobilization
and preparation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Friday speakers usually reflect the general feelings among ordinary
Palestinians. Palestinian sources today said minor protests against Jordan took place in
some localities in the southern parts of the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Hebron area, worshippers shouted slogans against Israel, the PA and
the Jordanian regime. However, it seemed the protests did not gather a strong momentum as
Islamist leaders associated with the Muslim Brotherhood opposed the holding of
demonstrations at this time, suggesting &#147;it is unwise to hold demonstrations at this
time.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel, for its part, welcomed the Jordanian measures against Hamas as
&#147;testimony to the cordial relations between our two countries.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dani Yatoum, the former Mossad chief who has since been appointed as
&#147;Coordinator of Jordanian-Israeli relations&#148;, was quoted by the Israeli press as
saying, &#147;The Jordanian authorities know exactly what we want.&#148;</p>
<font SIZE="3"><u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Misinformation</b></u></font><br>
Meanwhile, Jordanian officials continued to spread misinformation about the Hamas presence
in Jordan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a brazen and brash barrage of lies, the Jordanian Prime Minister, Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh, accused Hamas of stockpiling weapons in Karak and of planting seeds of
division among Jordanians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas officials as well as Jordanian opposition figures wasted no time in
refuting Rawabdeh&#146;s allegations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas issued a statement on 18 September refuting Rawabdeh&#146;s claim
&#147;item by item.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hamas statement, which was posted on the Movement&#146;s site on the
internet, marveled at Rawabdeh&#146;s allegations, including the accusation that Hamas was
stockpiling weapons in the Karak area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement said &#147;Rawabdeh knows quite well that Hamas had nothing
to do with that as established by the Jordanian police and courts, when the issue arose
several years ago.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the statement challenged Rawabdeh to produce even a shred of
evidence that Hamas was &#147;keeping illegal weapons,&#148; saying that the three pistols
confiscated in their offices were licensed by the authorities and meant to be used in
self-defense if necessary!!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">An Open Letter to &quot;Abu Jerry&quot;</font></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So what do you say?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What was it like, that moment at 10 o'clock in the morning when you turned
off the deafening music, removed the sacks from all the bowed heads, unlocked the
handcuffs, releasing the swollen wrists, and raised up dozens of distorted bodies from
those awkward stools? How was it when you detached the chains hanging from the ceiling and
allowed the stretched bodies to collapse and relax. Did you abruptly stop the
&quot;shaking&quot; or did you finish one last farewell round? Did your boot complete its
push on an exposed belly or did it retreat?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was as much a total surprise for me as for you. We were sitting in the
Supreme Court, not believing, as Judge Matza read out the nine judges' unanimous decision:
&quot;We are making the order-to-show-cause final for all conditions and in all
situations. Torture and any humiliating positions are forbidden. 'Shabah' is forbidden.
The frog position is forbidden. The sack on the head is forbidden. Forbidden. Forbidden.
Forbidden.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To my ears the decision played like pure beautiful music. The Court was
reading the correct, perfect, obvious decision and I felt as if it had just recreated the
Bill of Human Rights. Every argument we had researched, any claim we had brought for years
and years, all found their natural place in this decision.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was looking at you and saw you sitting there, pale and abandoned, as if
you had lost your whole world in an instant. And when you came out into the hallway, it
was not with the usual self-assured step and cocky gait.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We both remember all the long sessions, case after case, when you
explained that, &quot;It's not exactly torture&quot; and &quot;for the security of the
State&quot; and, moreover, &quot;secret material&quot; and &quot;on camera&quot; and
&quot;with good intentions&quot;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All of a sudden, in a well-argued decision in front of your eyes, 32 years
of security heroism were turned into 32 years of forbidden criminality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like the spoiled and admired child you were, you reacted spontaneously:
&quot;Good! So we'll give the keys to the judges and we'll see them carrying out the
interrogations.&quot; Was it out of a need to comfort you when I said that there are other
dangerous places in the world and other interrogators who achieve breakthroughs with
security offenders? You have not invented the war against terror; it is possible to handle
interrogations to reach your objectives while safeguarding the law. I reminded you of all
the examples we brought to the Court when offences, no less severe, were solved without
the use of your brutal means.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Have you noticed how all your argumentation has been turned upside down?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Allow me to remind you: until 1987, you totally denied the existence of
torture. The Palestinians, and moreover the self-hating Jews, were just defaming you. When
the Landau Commission lit the darkness of your interrogation room with a penlight, you
were forced to admit that there is moderate use of physical pressure and to promise that
you would stop lying in the courts and in the interrogation committees. And then, over the
years, as the transparency grew, you admitted, little by little, that there are
&quot;special means&quot; and even the use of reasonable force, and after an accident or
two, you even admitted to the &quot;shaking&quot;. And then you fired the interrogator who
kicked too much. But you did not go overboard: you only sentenced to internal disciplinary
censure the one who choked to death the detainee...who the hell knew that he was
asthmatic? After too many on-the-job accidents, you set down regulations, you asked for
and received government coverage and you entered the era of bureaucratized torture. And
then, in spite of everything going so well, all those human rights organizations and those
heathens who deny security is above all, pounced on you with huge floodlights and exposed
all the tied-up and the crawling and the hanged and the bent. In the glare of this total
exposure, you evaporate and dissolve like fungus that has no existence but in humid
darkness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All of a sudden, you are the one who cries, &quot;Help!&quot; All of a
sudden, the heads of the security services for generations&#151;the professional torture
deniers&#151;are shouting from the rooftops like addicts in crisis. &quot;Bring us our
tools, give us back the rack and the tongs. We cannot live without them.&quot; Aren't you
ashamed?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Relax. I genuinely believe that you can relax. Hang a sign in the security
services (Shabak) dining room that says, &quot;Torture and ill-treatment are
unconditionally forbidden.&quot; And start working like any professional secret service
interrogator. It is not such a shame to carry out interrogation like professional police.
So what if you have to employ intelligence in the interrogation? Remember how you managed
to crack the Jewish underground without having them pass through your torture chamber?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Think of the many thousands of guards, soldiers, policewomen and men,
doctors and judges who you turned into secret accomplices to your sins.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You forced them to tie up and take down, push down and wake up, heal and
prepare the hundreds of thousands of detainees in every last one of your institutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They are free of you today.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And especially think how you are getting rid of the glances. You remember
all those brown eyes, begging for some mercy, crying with pain, that said that we will do
whatever you want and confess to whatever you say. You cannot forget that you have always
known that at a certain moment they will have a different gaze. Just in the blink of an
eye, you read their promise for revenge. You remember how many times a quick shiver and a
hesitation crept through you when those eyes told you that this humiliation and pain will
never be forgotten and will blow up in your face one day. And you saw, deep within
yourself, that the next bomb is one that you have created with your own hands.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></i><font color="#FF0000">An Open Letter to Yasser Arafat</font><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. President,</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I heard you defend the latest agreement with Israel, listing its positive
merits for the Palestinian cause, especially the hand-over of additional territory to the
Palestinian administration. This is undoubtedly a laudable achievement, for the recovery
of even 1 square metre of Palestinian land from the enemy is a step in the right
direction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I&#146;m not here to assess the merits of the agreement, for the coming
days and months will pass their judgement on it as well as on the entire peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But I must convey to you my deep anxiety (and I believe the anxiety of a
good many Palestinians at home and in the Diaspora) over the future of this dreadful
&#147;peace process&#148;, which could spell disaster for all of us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are worried that the Palestinian Authority, especially you, Mr.
President, will repeat and ruminate the same dismal patterns of negotiation that we
witnessed in the course of the past six years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In truth, these patterns were extremely poor, ineffective, inconsistent,
and even scandalous in many respects. I say this because our negotiators, presumably at
your instruction, effectively subjected nearly all contentious issues to the kind of
haggling and bargaining that we witness at the Friday market. Thus, our &#147;national red
lines&#148; (if indeed we ever had such a thing as red lines) were always ignored and
crossed by our under-qualified negotiators.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I most sincerely believe that the repetition of these patterns during the
final status talks would lead to a definite gigantic disaster for our people and our
cause. We pray to the Almighty that it won&#146;t happen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The number of prisoners who were supposed to be freed plummeted from 650,
as stipulated in the hapless Wye River memorandum, to just 350. Added to that, Mr.
President, is the fact that you effectively came to terms, though perhaps begrudgingly,
with the blatant Israeli classification of our political prisoners and freedom fighters
into such unacceptable categories as Fatah, Hamas, blood on their hands, Jerusalemites,
Israeli-Arabs, non-Palestinian Arabs, etc.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is lamentable, even unforgivable, that you decided to accept Zionist
dictates to that effect. Indeed, what can you tell the wives, mothers, sisters and
children of those prisoners who wouldn&#146;t pass the Israeli filter?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Doesn&#146;t the PLO represent all Palestinians, irrespective of their
political affiliations? If so, why did you agree to exclude the Islamist prisoners from
the previous releases? Or do you think those prisoners belong to a lower Hindu caste, or
children of a lesser God?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You told us, Mr. President, after you signed the Oslo Agreement that by
the end of the interim phase, which ended on 4 May 1999, the Israeli occupation army would
be out of as much as 90% of the West Bank. So, what happened, and how come the percentage
shrank from 90% to 40%, assuming that Barak will carry out the Sharm al Sheikh&#146;s
third phase of redeployment?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I and the rest of the Palestinian people would like to ask you about the
decisive third phase of redeployment stipulated in the Oslo Accords. We know that pursuant
to this phase, the occupation army is supposed to vacate the entirety of the West Bank
save military positions, settlements and Jerusalem, which will be discussed in the
framework of the final status issues.</p>
<font SIZE="3"><u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, what happened to the third phase? </b></u></font><br>
I can understand that you had to concede on &#147;tactical&#148; or &#147;non-fundamental
issues,&#148; but can you guarantee that you won&#146;t concede on the fundamental final
status issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, the fate of the 5 million Palestinian
refugees now dispersed in the Four Corners of the globe, without any real hope of
returning home?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You might argue, Mr. President, that the final status talks will be
governed by UN resolutions 242 and 338. But everybody knows that our understanding and
interpretation of the two resolutions are radically different from the Israeli
understanding and interpretation of the same resolutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, is there any guarantee that Israel and the United States will not
impose their twisted and flagrant concept of the two resolutions on a weak Palestinian
leadership that looks desperate to have a &#147;State&#148; at any price?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, what would or what could the Palestinian leadership do if it came
to this point? Will the rules of the political game and the overall political realities on
the world arena allow us to say &#147;no&#148; and stick to it?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are worried that you, Mr. President, will betray us and betray the
Palestinian cause. We are worried that you will betray al-Quds al-Sharif, the Jewel of
Palestine, and the refugees. We are worried that you will cross the &#147;red lines&#148;
you now say you won&#146;t cross.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are worried that you will eventually accept a deformed State on parts
of the West Bank, without Jerusalem, and without the removal of Jewish settlements, a
State with a resonant name but with no real substance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An then perhaps you would tell the Palestinian people, &#147;Well, this is
the most I could possibly achieve under the existing circumstances.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We hope that we won&#146;t ever have to face this haunting nightmare.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, if it did come about, we would not hesitate even for one moment to
utter a big &#147;NO&#148; in your face&#133;because Palestine and Masjid al-Aqsa are much
more dearer to us than any mortal.</p>

Of The Wye River Memorandum</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</b><i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Dr. Norman G. Finkelstein</strong></i><b></p>

<p ALIGN="center">(3-3)</p>
</b><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority&#146;s &#147;deplorable&#148; human rights
record has been extensively documented.18 Without extenuating PA culpability, it bears
recalling that Israel recruited Arafat precisely in order to facilitate repression. Thus
Rabin boasted that the PA would quell Palestinian resistance &#147;without problems caused
by appeals to the High Court of Justice, without problems made by [the human rights
organization] B&#146;Tselem, and without problems from all sorts of bleeding hearts and
mothers and fathers.&#148; Truth be told, &#147;Palestinian Authority&#148; is a misnomer.
Apart from what Israel and the United States authorize it to do, the PA exercises no
authority whatsoever: in all respects it is in thrall to them. The Oslo process marked, in
Meron Benvenisti&#146;s phrase, the continuation of &#147;occupation ... albeit by remote
control.&#148; In exchange for the perquisites of collaboration, the PA must ruthlessly
crush all opposition to continued Israeli occupation.19</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Human Rights Watch observes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The role of Israel, the U.S., and the international community in
  influencing the conduct of the PA should not be underestimated....[E]xternal demands that
  the PA halt anti-Israel violence have been made in terms that condone a disregard for the
  human rights of Palestinians. Such pressure is highly potent, due in part to the situation
  of extreme political and economic dependency in which the self-rule entity exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It goes on to recall that &#147;the Netanyahu government...conditioned the
easing of the closure of the West Bank and Gaza on a halt in prisoner releases by the
PA&#148;; that &#147;the Clinton administration demanded that Arafat act more decisively
to prevent anti-Israel violence, but made no reference to the need for due process, even
as ... massive, arbitrary round-ups were taking place&#148;; that &#147;as President
Arafat cracked down on the opposition, particularly Islamist groups, by carrying out
arbitrary arrests, detaining people without charge, and practicing torture, Israel and the
United States praised the crackdown while remaining largely silent on the facts&#148;; and
that &#147;despite clear evidence of the systematically unfair practices of the state
security courts, neither Vice-President Al Gore nor any other U.S. official has publicly
retracted the praise for their creation that Gore offered.&#148;20</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The single most egregious Palestinian violation of Oslo is the size of its
police force, which &#147;well exceeds&#148; (Human Rights Watch) the already
extraordinary 30,000 figure allowed for in the Interim Agreement (Annex I, Article IV).
Revealingly, Israel hasn&#146;t exerted any real pressure on Arafat to correct this.
Indeed, already thinking ahead in the 1978 Camp David Accords, Israeli negotiators
stipulated that the &#147;self-governing authority&#148; in the West Bank and Gaza should
constitute a &#147;strong police force&#148; to assure Israel&#146;s &#147;security&#148;
(Framework, paragraph A2). The same ominous phrase stipulating a &#147;strong police
force&#148; reappears in the September 1993 Declaration of Principles (Article VIII), the
May 1994 Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area (Article VIII), and twice in the
Interim Agreement (Articles XII, XIV). The Wye Memorandum calls on the &#147;Palestinian
side&#148; only to &#147;provide a list of its policemen to the Israeli side.&#148; So
long as Israel can monitor in which direction the rifles are pointed, the more police, the
better &#151; especially as Palestinian illusions are dispelled and resistance mounts. The
Wye &#147;land-for-security&#148; formula means, incidentally, that in return for any
land, the Palestinians forfeit the right to all resistance, including the basically
non-violent civil disobedience characterizing the first years of the intifada, condemned
by Israel and the United States as &#147;terrorist acts.&#148;21 Nelson Mandela renounced
the right to armed resistance only after the South African government acknowledged the
right of the indigenous population not to a Bantustan but full human rights. The
indigenous population of Palestine was forced by Israel to forfeit its right to any
resistance in exchange for a Bantustan.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Prospects</u></b><br>
Like the South African Bantustans, the fragmented Palestinian entity resulting from the
Oslo process will no doubt eventually be granted statehood.22 And like the Bantustans, it
will be a state in name only. Recall that the viability of a Palestinian state resulting
from full Israeli withdrawal was never at all certain; much intellectual energy was
expended to conquer these doubts. What then is one to make of a Palestinian state
resulting from a partial Israeli withdrawal? Israel is now &#147;resigned&#148; to the
prospect of an independent Palestinian state because it won&#146;t be one. Recall further
that, for Bantustan critics, the issue was not only viability but equity: Whites
engineered a grossly inequitable division of South Africa&#146;s resources, keeping for
themselves everything worth keeping. All the Bantustans won was the right &#151; in the
words of one dissenter &#151; to &#147;police themselves and administer their own
poverty.&#148;23 This is also the only right Palestinians can expect to win under Oslo.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The purpose of the protracted &#147;transitional&#148; period in the Oslo
process is not to build &#147;trust&#148; between Israel and Palestine but rather to
structurally consolidate Israel&#146;s domination over Palestine. In addition to
settlement- and road-building, this entails coopting Palestinian elites, refining
&#147;security collaboration,&#148; etc. The main alleged threat to Israeli security in
June, 1967, was not the West Bank but the Egyptian Sinai. In October, 1973, Egypt launched
a surprise attack, seeming to threaten Israel&#146;s existence and costing nearly 3,000
Israeli lives (many times, incidentally, the total victims of Palestinian
&#147;terrorism&#148;). Nonetheless once Israel decided on full withdrawal, trust somehow
proved not at all an obstacle: a mere three years elapsed between Camp David and
Israel&#146;s total pull-out from the Sinai. Yet the Oslo process is already in its fifth
year with no end to the purported &#147;trust-building&#148; process in sight. The Camp
David Accord and subsequent Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty combined came to less than a
dozen pages. The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement alone runs to hundreds of pages.
Israel is not ending the occupation; it is dotting all the i&#146;s and crossing all the
t&#146;s to secure it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat must eventually choose between two equally bad alternatives. He may
unilaterally declare an independent Palestinian state over 40 percent of the West Bank,
blustering, as the Bantustan leaders did, that this is &#147;only the first stage.&#148;
In fact, the main lesson of the South African experience was that emancipation was
achieved despite and around not through the Bantustans: indeed the Bantustans impeded the
struggle for justice. Declaring Oslo dead, Israel will then unilaterally annex the rest of
the West Bank. The more Netanyahu postures indignation at the prospect of a unilateral
Palestinian declaration, the better his pretext, if and when Arafat does so, to annex half
the West Bank. Totally dependent, Palestinian elites will continue to do Israel&#146;s
bidding, repressing dissent while enjoying the perquisites of collaboration. Pundits will
no doubt wax eloquent over the &#147;irony of history&#148;: although the &#147;peace
process&#148; died, each side got what it wanted &#151; the Palestinians a
&#147;state&#148; and Israel &#147;secure borders.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Enticed by a slightly larger Israeli withdrawal and an enlarged American
&#147;aid&#148; package, Arafat may alternatively enter into a final settlement with
Israel. Israel will then get an official deed to nearly all of Palestine: it would be the
jewel in the crown of Zionist diplomacy. &#147;At its heart,&#148; historian Martin
Gilbert writes, &#147;Zionism had striven for a hundred years for the recognition of its
legitimacy by the Palestinians.&#148; Indeed, for all its flouting of international law
and contempt for &#147;Goyim&#148; opinion, Israel has always sought official imprimaturs
of its proprietary right to Palestine.24 The Balfour Declaration and especially the 1947
U.N. Partition Resolution (181) loom large in Zionist histories.25 Property may be, as
Proudhon memorably put it, theft, but it is also theft invested with the power of
legitimacy. Hence Netanyahu&#146;s insistence at and since Wye that the Palestine National
Council officially, democratically, and without any ambiguity annul the Charter. For the
longest time Israel exploited the Charter to discredit the Palestinian leadership: it
&#147;served as a gold mine of raw material&#148; for &#147;Israel&#146;s
propaganda.&#148;26 Now that this same Palestinian leadership stands poised to
collaborate, Israel wants all the official documents to be fully in order. Not a scratch
of doubt must remain that Palestine belongs &#147;by right&#148; not at all to the
indigenous population but only to the Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Oslo process cannot produce a permanent settlement of the
Israel-Palestine conflict. The population between the Mediterranean and the Jordan will
soon be half Israeli-Jewish, half Palestinian-Arab. Lincoln long ago understood that a
state of affairs in which the population is half free, half enslaved cannot forever
endure. Israel no doubt also knows this. Edward Said rightly observes that Zionism&#146;s
successes owe much to its pragmatic discipline of detail (&#147;another dunum, another
goat&#148;). Yet ultimately, Zionism has always depended on the &#147;miracle&#148; to
break free from an impasse. Indeed, it harnessed the discipline of detail to make the
&#147;miracle&#148; possible.27 The intractable Arab &#147;demographic problem&#148; was
resolved in 1948 by the &#147;miraculous clearing of the land&#148; (Chaim Weizmann). The
loss of Zionist elan in the early 1960s was restored by the &#147;miracle&#148; of the
June War. The resurgent Arab &#147;demographic problem&#148; in the 1970s was overcome by
the &#147;miracle&#148; of Russian Jewry. Israel no doubt hopes for yet another
&#147;miracle&#148; to resolve the conflicts inherent in the Oslo process. An Oslo
settlement between Israel and Arafat would command international legitimacy. If
Palestinians continue to resist, Israel may engineer &#151; alas, with impunity &#151;
another &#147;miraculous clearing of the land.&#148; Public opinion within Israel would
pose no obstacle. Rather the contrary, polls indicate that, if there are no international
repercussions, fully 65 percent of Israelis would support expulsion of all the Arabs.28</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barring a &#147;miracle,&#148; the inevitable if very distant future is
one in which Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews, enjoying reciprocal individual and
communal rights, coexist within a unitary entity. Yet, just as the center of gravity of
the Palestinian struggle shifted from southern Lebanon to the occupied territories after
the defeat suffered in June 1982, so the center of gravity of the Palestinian struggle may
shift again from the West Bank and Gaza to Israel following the defeat suffered at Oslo.
Only the Israeli Palestinians now have a clear goal &#151; full individual and communal
rights &#151; and a leadership able to articulate it.29 Paradoxically, the fruit of Oslo
will perhaps be that the Palestinian struggle for justice will &#151; in Amilcar
Cabral&#146;s phrase &#151; &#147;return to the source.&#148; </font><font SIZE="2"></p>

and implementing a fair deal</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud</b><u></p>
</u></i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is an old story that tells of a man who complained that his house
was very small. The chief of the village visited the small house to calm the distressed
man and to ease his troubles. Yet the chief asked the man to share his tiny space with a
cow. The poor man screamed and with outrage protested the chief&#146;s unfair proposal.
With wisdom and a great deal of diplomacy, the chief convinced the man to follow the plan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few days later, instead of solving his problem, especially with a cow
laying in the living room, the chief dragged a donkey in and asked the man to host it in
the ever-shrinking house. With the same wisdom and diplomacy, the chief convinced the man
to keep the additional burden, for &#147;comfort was coming soon&#148;. The shrewd chief
nodded his head and promised. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few weeks later, the man ended up with his house converted into a farm
filled with all kinds of animals and animal waste. When the chief came to visit,
empty-handed this time, he asked the man to move the cow outside, leaving the donkey, a
goat and some hens. The man was slightly relieved, but not at all satisfied. The same
story was repeated, but this time the animals were moved out rather than in. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The chief made his last visit to the poor man, taking the last of the
animals outside. The man couldn&#146;t believe his eyes for now the once small house was
empty again. Filled with joy, the man kissed the chief&#146;s hands and feet, praised him
and asked God to extend the chief&#146;s life so he could always be there for him and all
the poor people of the village. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What sounds like a funny yet unbelievable story is in fact a frequently
repeated episode between Palestinians and Israelis in their ongoing peace talks. While
Israel stubbornly violates its previous commitments and asks for revisions on everything
once agreed upon, Palestinian officials cheerfully leave the negotiation table, describing
what has been modified and violated as the &#147;peace of the brave.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Cairo Agreement (Oslo 2) was signed, Israel failed to fulfill the
provisions of the agreement, which eventually led to the signing of the Wye River Accord
in October 1998.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After long and exhausting talks, accompanied by Israel&#146;s arrogance
and Netanyahu&#146;s stiffness, Palestinians were driven to sign an agreement that ensured
a mere 13% Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, in comparison to 33% demanded by the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once again, Palestinians found themselves helpless regarding Israel&#146;s
intentional failure to implement what had been reached, confirmed and signed. Even the
United States&#146; role had no leverage before the Israeli refusal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Barak was elected to office, and Arab and Western governments chanted
his name (even after his well-known red lines were proclaimed regarding Palestinian
rights), Israel insisted on renegotiating Wye River, which itself was a re-negotiated
version of the Cairo agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the midst of these manipulative Israeli schemes, everyone, including
Palestinians, forgot, or perhaps overlooked the fact that Palestinians never endorsed the
original Wye Agreement as a victory to start with. Therefore the two unfair revisions of
the already impartial agreement shall always lead to yet a newer version of an unjust
agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has maintained its image as the compromising peacemaker. Every time
it has signed a deal, even if it violates the agreement later on, it is reported in the
international media as a champion for peace. With the years, the repetition of such terms
has gained Israel the image of the compromiser, rather than the occupier or the aggressor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has succeeded in forcing its own interpretation of any signed
accord with its Palestinian counterpart. What has helped Israel in consistently getting
its way is the fact that Palestinians ran out of patience, for they had no strong form of
leverage to implement, while Israel had no real reason to expedite negotiations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since last October, Israeli settlers, with the approval of the Israeli
government, built over 20 new settlements in the West Bank. Barak&#146;s government, which
vowed to follow the path of peace, gave the green light to expand many settlements in the
Occupied Territories, adding thousands of new units, as well as starting construction work
in Ras Al-Amoud and Har Homa, both in occupied East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s strategy of winning time has resulted in additional land
confiscation and house demolitions. Since the Oslo accord was signed, 600 Palestinian
homes have been demolished and 140,000 dunums of land were confiscated by both settlers
and the Israeli army. This way, Israel has succeeded in widening its control of West
Bank&#146;s areas, creating a stronger Israeli presence in the Occupied Territories,
rather than reducing its presence as the Palestinians had hoped. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With all of these Israeli gains in mind, it is inappropriate to argue that
Palestinians have gained much from the newly reached Sharm El-Sheikh agreement. The result
of the tiresome peace talks was neither the birth of the &#147;peace of the brave&#148;,
nor did it revive hope for a more promising future for Palestinians. It was simply the
expected conclusion of a very well-thought-out Israeli scheme, which left Israel with a
greater bargain than what Netanyahu had achieved at Wye River. On the other hand, it left
Palestinian officials cheerfully but unrealistically celebrating victory, and once again
left Palestinian national unity at risk. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Not the Walt Disney I knew</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Ruth Anderson</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Walt Disney animations were always my favourite when I was a child growing
up in a long-ago America. Before my mother was born, in the late 1920s, Walt Disney
introduced his most enduring character, Mickey Mouse. Disney also originated the
feature-length cartoon with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Along with cartoon feature movies, Disney also began to produce books for
children and began the syndication of comic strips featuring such stars as Donald Duck and
Pluto.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1955, Walt Disney Productions opened the huge amusement park called
Disneyland in California. But now, on 1 October 1999, at the Disney World theme park in
Florida, an exhibition depicting Jerusalem as Israel&#146;s capital is scheduled to open.
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman stated recently that the exhibit would show the
contested city as Israel&#146;s capital. The exhibit, he said, would be, &#147;presented
in its original version, which explains the central importance of Jerusalem for the Jewish
people, from the time of Moses, until the first Israeli government of David Ben Gurion,
who declared it the capital of Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, a spokesperson for Saudi billionaire, Prince al-Walid Ben Talal,
a major EuroDisney shareholder, said last week he had obtained a promise from the Disney
management to change the theme of the exhibit.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a statement issued Friday, 17 October, Disney said the exhibit would
explore the history of the city but would not make any reference to political ideology.
Arab foreign ministers met in Cairo a few weeks ago to set up a committee to meet with
Disney officials and ensure that Israel does not exploit the exhibition &#147;for
political ends.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Arab League issued a statement saying, &#147;the Jerusalem display is
tantamount to a celebration of the city as an integral part of Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And even though some mention was made of the Christian and Muslim
connections to Jerusalem, they were &#147;marginalized by the emphasis on Jerusalem as a
Jewish city,&#148; it said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists have gained mastery over Palestine, village by village, town
by town, and tomorrow the whole of Jerusalem will be sold and then Palestine in its
entirety.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It must be remembered that from 70 CE (Common Era) when the Roman emperor
Titus destroyed the Temple, the Jewish community in Palestine practically ceased to exist.
In 1170 CE, there were only 1,440 Jews in all of Palestine, and 100 years later, there
were only two Jewish families in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 CE, they burned the Jews in
their synagogue. It was only when Saladin, the Muslim conqueror, recaptured the city in
1187 CE that he allowed the Jews to return. Jerusalem has been Arab for more than 2,000
years. It is only right, fair and legal that it remain so.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The entertainment business in California should not mix politics as a
means to promote their own self-interests. It is especially essential that Walt Disney
Productions remain aloof from Israeli-Palestinian political ideologies and refrain from
taking sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Walt Disney ignores Arab concerns over the planned exhibit portraying
Jerusalem as Israel&#146;s capital, it causes a controversy that has stirred growing Arab
and Muslim calls for a boycott of Disney products, which happen to be extremely popular in
Arab countries. Several Arab countries have considered joining a campaign for a boycott
and an Egyptian minister is seriously considering suggesting that Saudi Arabia and
Morocco, which have their own pavilions at the theme park, run a rival exhibit promoting
&#147;Arab&#148; Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I would like to see my old childhood favourites remain forever embedded in
my mind and heart as non-political cartoon characters. Characters that will continue to
spread moral goodness and integrity. Characters that uphold the truth and respect the
freedom of those so valiantly struggling for it. Characters that teach love, kindness and
forgiveness to all those who seek it and most importantly characters that encourage
youngsters to one day forge a kind of world where justice and human rights prevail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout its long history, Jerusalem has been a matrix of ethnic
metabolism. It is because of the continuous process all during the course of history that
the people known as the Palestinians have evolved. This is backed by historical evidence
and not as the Zionists claim that there is a pure race of Jews. Jews are no longer a race
of people but follow Judaism, which is one of the three monotheistic religions like
Christianity and Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jews have no historic, religious and certainly no legal right to make
Jerusalem the capital of Israel. Jerusalem is Palestinian and it is a city for the three
religions. Formerly, under Muslim rule, all, regardless of religious ties, were free to
practice their faith as they pleased without fear of reprisal or harassment. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem has been called the &#147;city of peace.&#148; But there can be
no peace when the indigenous inhabitants of the city are forced out of their homes and off
their land in order that incoming Jews can make Arab homes Jewish.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Time will tell about how Disney will exhibit Jerusalem in its exhibition.
Let us hope that Disney, the same Disney that we all know and love, regardless of our
ethnic origin or faith, will remain impartial and not permit the aggressor in the
Palestinian territories to have yet another means to promote Zionism and the complete
takeover of not only all of Jerusalem but of all Palestine.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Israel breaches Arab Religious Freedom</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 9 September 1999, the U.S. Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor, Department of State released its first annual report reviewing the International
religious freedom. The report covered the period from 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1999. The
report highlights Israel&#146;s breaches of the religious freedom of Arab minorities.
Following is the full text of Israel&#146;s section in the US report.</i></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Section I. Freedom of Religion</u></b> <br>
The (Israeli) Government recognizes 5 religions, including 10 Christian groups. Each
religion recognized by the Government has its own religious court system, which has
considerable authority over issues of personal status. Government recognition is limited
to religions present in the country before 1948. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Approximately 80 percent of citizens are Jewish (with a significant
secular majority), while approximately 16 percent are Muslims, 2 percent are Christians,
and 1.5 percent are Druze. The non-Jewish population is concentrated in the north,
east-central, and southern parts of the country. The population includes small but growing
numbers of adherents of nonrecognized evangelical Christian groups and members of other
faiths, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The overwhelming majority of non-Jewish citizens are Arabs and they are
subject to various forms of discrimination. It is not clear that whatever discrepancies
exist in the treatment of various communities in Israeli society are based on religion per
se. Israeli Arabs and other non-Jewish Israelis are, in fact, free to practice their
religions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government does not provide Israeli Arabs, who constitute 20 percent
of the population, with the same quality of education, housing, employment opportunities,
and social services as Jews. In addition, government spending and financial support are
proportionally far lower in predominantly non-Jewish areas than in Jewish areas. According
to the press, an Interior Ministry report released during 1998 notes that non-Jewish
communities receive significantly less government financial support than their Jewish
counterparts. Israeli-Arab organizations have challenged the Government's &quot;Master
Plan for the Northern Areas of Israel,&quot; which listed as priority goals increasing the
Galilee's Jewish population and blocking the territorial contiguity of Arab villages and
towns, on the grounds that it discriminates against Arab citizens. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government provides proportionally greater financial support to
religious and civic institutions in the Jewish sector compared with those in the
non-Jewish sector, i.e., Muslim, Christian, and Druze. For example, only 2 percent of the
Ministry of Religious Affairs budget goes to the non-Jewish sector. The Ministry's 1998
budget actually reduced the percentage. The High Court of Justice heard a case in February
1997 alleging that this budgetary allocation constitutes discrimination. The Court refused
to rule on the case in 1997 and suggested that the petitioners refile the case after the
passage of the 1998 budget, which the petitioners did. After three hearings during 1998,
the Court ruled that the budget allocation did in fact constitute &quot;prima facie
discrimination&quot; but that the plaintiff's petition did not provide adequate
information about the religious needs of the various communities. The Court refused to
intervene in the budgetary process on the grounds that such action would invade the proper
sphere of the legislature. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In civic areas where religion is a determining criterion, such as the
religious courts and centers of education, non-Jewish institutions routinely receive less
state support than their Jewish counterparts. The status of a number of Christian
organizations with representation in Israel has heretofore been defined by a collection of
ad hoc arrangements with various government agencies. Several of these organizations seek
to negotiate with the Government in an attempt to formalize their status. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government has recognized Jewish holy places under the 1967 Protection
of Holy Sites Law. The Government states that it also protects the holy sites of other
faiths. The Government also states that it has provided funds for some holy sites of other
faiths. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Missionaries are allowed to proselytize, although the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-Day Saints voluntarily refrains from proselytizing under an agreement
with the Government. A 1977 antiproselytizing law prohibits anyone from offering or
receiving material benefits as an inducement to conversion; there have been no reports of
its enforcement. Bills that would have further restricted proselytizing were introduced
and passed their preliminary readings in 1997 and 1998 with the support of some government
ministers; however, no further action was taken before the dissolution of the Knesset
following the May 1999 elections. They are not expected to be enacted if reintroduced in
the Knesset. Christian and other evangelical groups asserted that the draft bills were
discriminatory and served to intimidate Christian groups. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Evangelical Christian and other religious groups also have complained that
the police have been slow to investigate incidents of harassment, threats, and vandalism
directed against their meetings, churches, and other facilities by two ultra-Orthodox
Jewish groups, known as Yad L'achim and Lev L'achim. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government confers automatic citizenship and residence rights to
Jewish immigrants, their families, and Jewish refugees under the Law of Return. This law
does not apply to non-Jews or to persons of Jewish descent who have converted to another
faith. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government designates religion on national identity document, but not
on passports. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Orthodox Jewish religious authorities have exclusive control of Jewish
marriages, divorces, and burials. They do not recognize marriages or conversions to
Judaism performed in Israel by non-Orthodox rabbis. Many Jews object to this exclusive
control and it has been at times a source of serious controversy in society. Many Jews who
wish to marry in secular or non-Orthodox religious ceremonies do so abroad, and the
Ministry of Interior recognizes such marriages. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Members of nonrecognized religions (particularly evangelical Christians)
suffer difficulties conducting marriages and funerals, although informal arrangements
provide some relief. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Religious affiliation plays a key role in daily life, particularly in
matters of birth, marriage, divorce, and death. Each recognized religious community has
legal authority over its members in matters of marriage and divorce. Secular courts have
primacy over questions of inheritance, but parties, by mutual agreement, may bring cases
to religious courts. Jewish and Druze families may ask that some family status matters,
such as alimony and child custody in divorces, be adjudicated in civil courts as an
alternative to religious courts. Christians may only ask that child custody and child
support be adjudicated in civil courts as an alternative to religious courts. Muslims have
no recourse to civil courts in family-status matters. Legislation passed in 1996 allows
the rabbinical courts to sanction either party who is not willing to grant a divorce. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government generally continued to permit Muslim citizens to make the
Hajj during the period covered by this report. However, for security reasons, the
Government imposes some restrictions on its Muslim citizens who perform the Hajj,
including requiring that they be over the age of 30. The Government will not allow them to
return if they leave the country without formal permission. The Government justifies these
restrictions on the grounds that Saudi Arabia remains officially at war with Israel and
that travel to Saudi Arabia therefore is considered subject to security considerations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jehovah's Witnesses complained of inadequate police response to numerous
incidents of harassment, assaults, theft, and vandalism during the period covered by this
report, reportedly by two ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups, known as Yad L'achim and Lev
L'achim. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses assert that police did not adequately
investigate two break-ins at a meeting house in Lod in February 1998. Jehovah's Witnesses
filed over 120 complaints about such incidents with the police during 1998 and the first
half of 1999. There have been no indictments or prosecutions in these cases. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One member of Jehovah's Witnesses was arrested and charged with
&quot;offending religious sentiment&quot; for allegedly distributing religious literature
at Tel Aviv's central bus station on March 1, 1999. The arrest followed a complaint by a
member of the Yad L'achim organization. The individual alleged that he was singled out
because he had filed five separate complaints against members of Yad L'achim. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Section II. Societal Attitudes</b> </u><br>
Relations between different religious groups are often strained, both between Jews and
non-Jews, as well as among the different branches of Judaism. Tensions between Jews and
non-Jews exist primarily as a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict, as well as Israel's
control of sites holy to Christians and Muslims. Friction between Christians and Muslims
in the Arab community increased during the period covered by this report, primarily as a
result of a dispute about a plot of land alleged to belong to the Waqf (Islamic religious
trust) in Nazareth. This led to small outbreaks of violence in April and June 1999.
Animosity between secular and religious Jews continued to grow during the period covered
by this report. Non-Orthodox Jews have complained of discrimination and intolerance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Societal attitudes towards conversion are particularly negative. Religious
and lay leaders of most religions are largely hostile to missionary activity. Muslims
consider any conversion from Islam to be apostasy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jehovah's Witnesses suffered verbal abuse, assaults, theft, and vandalism
during the period covered by the report (see Section I). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Evangelical Christian and other religious groups suffered numerous
incidents of often-violent harassment (also see Section I). For example, a meeting of
self-described &quot;Messianic Jews&quot; in the southern city of Beersheba was broken up
violently in May 1999 by a group of Jews opposed to their activities. Such incidents are
not limited to non-Jews. Instances of ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups verbally or physically
harassing Jewish citizens for &quot;immodest dress&quot; or other violations of their
interpretation of religious law are not uncommon and have increased during the period
covered by this report. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The overwhelming majority of non-Jewish citizens are Arabs and they are
subject to various forms of discrimination. It is not clear that whatever discrepancies
exist in the treatment of various communities in Israeli society are based on religion per
se. Israeli Arabs and other non-Jewish Israelis are, in fact, free to practice their
religions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Relative to their numbers, Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the
student bodies and faculties of most universities, and in higher-level professional and
business ranks. Well-educated Arabs often are unable to find jobs commensurate with their
level of education. Arab Ph.D.'s suffer the greatest problems in this regard. A small
number of Israeli Arabs have risen to responsible positions in the civil service,
generally in the Arab departments of government ministries. In 1994 a civil service
commission began a 3-year affirmative action program to expand that number, but it has had
only modest results. The Government has allocated only very limited resources to enforce
landmark 1995 legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In practice Israeli Arab citizens who do not serve in the military and
therefore cannot obtain security clearances are not allowed to work in companies with
defense contracts or in security-related fields. The Israeli Druze and Circassian
communities are subject to the military draft, and although some have refused to serve,
the overwhelming majority accept service willingly. Some Bedouin and other Arab citizens
who are not subject to the draft serve voluntarily. Those not subject to the draft have
less access than other citizens to those social and economic benefits for which military
service is a prerequisite or an advantage, such as housing, new-household subsidies, and
government or security-related industrial employment. Under a 1994 government policy
decision, the social security child allowance for parents who did not serve in the
military and did not attend a yeshiva (including Arabs) was increased to equal the
allowance of those who had done so. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Arab groups allege that many employers use the prerequisite of
military service to avoid hiring non-Jews. For example, in 1997 a Haifa employment agency
advertisied for Arabic-speaking telephone operators and listed military service as a
prerequisite. An Israeli Arab group noted that there was no clear justification for this
requirement and threatened to file a civil suit under a law prohibiting employment
discrimination and defining requirements unrelated to actual work as discriminatory. The
employment agency eventually agreed to change the advertisement and run it again. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arab children make up about one-quarter of Israel's public school
population, but government resources for them are not proportionate to those for Jewish
children. Many schools in Arab communities are dilapidated and overcrowded, lack special
education services and counselors, have poor libraries, and have no sports facilities.
Arab groups also note that the public school curriculum stresses the country's Jewish
culture and heritage. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">E. Yaghi</b></p>

<p ALIGN="center">(To Gerrit and freedom)</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once upon a midnight dreary in a far, far away place, there lived a kindly
red fox by the name of Ben E. Volent. Ben was the leader of his skulk in a remote,
jungle-like area found on few maps but known in the animal kingdom as the Land of
Pandemonium. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, Benny had taken great pains to become the leader of his skulk
There were countless scars on his furry red coat to testify to the battles that he had
fought to become the dominant one in his skulk, not to mention portions of his territory
that he had ceded to those nightmarish geeks, the jackals, just so he could keep the best
of the food supply for him and his mate and keep the scraps for the rest of the foxes he
ruled over. It was funny, he mused, how the rest of the skulk could be so appreciative for
nearly nothing. But then, after all, he was the leader! It was important that he never go
hungry no matter how many other foxes might feel the pangs of starvation eating away at
the linings of their bellies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He had fought foxes from other skulks long and hard for his mate. She was
the most beautiful fox he had ever seen, and he loved her name. Before they shared the
same den, he would howl her name to the moon, calling endless times, &#147;De Base, De
Base, De Baseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Benny had so many foxes to serve him and his mate De. They would hunt for
him and his mate all sorts of mammals, birds, insects and fish. They would also bring for
him and De fruits, berries and carrion. And always, before his fox servants left their
leader, they would say, &#147;Is there anything else you desire, Sire?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, Sire was not greedy and easily satisfied. Since he had the best
of the food supply, what more could he ask for? He grew plump and so did De. Every day he
padded quietly across the sparse grass of his Pandemonium and gloated at his gains. If
only the jackals would stay away, then everything would be perfect, he thought one damp,
humid evening as he paced back and forth in front of his den.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He knew that he might be able to bribe them with the gift of a sick or old
fox every now and then as a source of nourishment, for he knew, too, that jackals would
eat anything, even a sickly or old fox.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So it was arranged that every month, he would secretly hand over a sick or
old fox as a kind of Danegeld. Payment of a Danegeld would ensure that the jackals
acknowledge Ben&#146;s jurisdiction and stay out of his Pandemonium.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But one day, when Benny was lying down and sunning his shiny red coat of
fur, the leader of the pack of jackals sauntered over to him. Benny jumped up. The head
jackal howled a long, piercing howl that shattered the quiet of the hot summer day and
made the hair on the back of Benny&#146;s neck stand straight up. Other jackals in the
distance howled back as if to show that they were giving their leader the support he
wanted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Benny lowered his tail, flattened his ears and slunk himself closer to the
head jackal. In reply, the jackal snarled and displayed sharp, yellow fangs and said,
&#147;Well, Ben E. Volent, how are you doing today, and how is your beautiful mate De
Base?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ben&#146;s ears pricked up a bit and with a glint of hope in his sharp
eyes, replied, &#147;Why, your Graciousness, so kind of you to ask! De is fine and soon to
deliver some pups to our skulk. What brings you here, your Graciousness and my good
friend?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still showing his fangs, the head jackal snarled again, &#147;Our food
supply is running low. We need to take some of the Pandemonium hunting grounds so that we
can replenish our dwindling supply of mammals.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Furthermore,&#148; he continued with a hiss and a rasp, &#147;one
sick or old fox each month is not nearly enough. My pack is hungry, and as you know,
scavengers that we are, we eat anything and everything!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our hero Benny gulped. He hung his tail lower. What a dilemma! How could
he give up more of his treasured Pandemonium? And how could he continue to sacrifice more
than one fox each month? But as necessity is the mother of invention, it suddenly dawned
on him. Low down in the cunning depth of his benevolent mind, he thought of a way to
survive, for he was best at survival. His father had always taught him that in the jungle,
survival of the fittest rules.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I can understand your problem, your Graciousness,&#148; he said to
the head jackal. &#147;Your requests shall be met, have no fear. Each month you shall have
two foxes to feast on, and I will cede to you some more of the best hunting grounds of
Pandemonium!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Satisfied, the head jackal smugly displayed his yellow fangs once more and
with a warning, left with the snarl, &#147;Be sure you meet my demands. We will show no
mercy to you and your skulk if you don&#146;t, and the first to go will be you and after
that your precious De and then your pups! You are fat and we will feast on your
carcass.&#148;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">A shiver rattled Ben&#146;s bones as he imagined himself the feast for the
  jackals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before the jackal left, the fox sniffed the air and muttered to himself,
&#147;Sheez! That dog has a bad case of halitosis! He should see a good vet!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ben should have been concerned to say the least...nay, he should have
panicked. But he was not concerned and he did not panic. As soon as the head jackal
disappeared, the fox&#146;s ears sharpened when he noticed a slight sound. He heard an
earthworm bristling through the grass. Pinpointing the movement of the worm, Ben poised
and then plunged his muzzle into the grass to grab it. The worm tried to resist Ben&#146;s
tug, but the fox pulled it taut until he freed it and in one swallow, Ben did away with
this small appetizer. He then yawned and stretched out once again in the hot sun,
remembering that his skulk would soon provide him and De with succulent tasty morsels to
dine on and that he really had nothing at all to worry about.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So it passed. Ben kept his word. He gave the jackals some of
Pandemonium&#146;s best hunting grounds and each month supplied them with two old or sick
foxes, whatever the case might be. Remember that Ben E. Volent was cunning and one that
knew how to survive in his jungle, so in order to appease the members of his skulk, he
benevolently donated one of his many dens for the homeless. Little understood was that the
homeless would one by one become meals for the pack of jackals and that the caretakers of
the den would convince the rest of the homeless tenants that those who suddenly
disappeared each month had been relocated to a new housing complex where they would live
comfortably ever after.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ben&#146;s plan was sure to succeed because one fine day, when the jungle
smelled especially fragrant and almost like heaven, he decided to call all members of his
skulk to his podium where he gave the most eloquent speech he had ever given. He was an
expert at equivocating and none could exceed him when it came to expatiation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At last, when it looked like all the skulk was bored to tears or falling
asleep, he ended his lengthy speech with, &#147;And so, my fine fellow foxes, we all must
sacrifice so that we can all survive in our beautiful Pandemonium. However, in order for
us to survive, I encourage all of you to have as many pups as you can. We will gain
strength in numbers!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His skulk was overjoyed at his speech. They clapped their padded feet and
stamped about in the jungle. Truly, their leader was the greatest of all foxes and they
would do anything to ensure his well-being and safety. And look how generous he was to
provide the homeless foxes with one of his elaborate dens, Ben heard each whisper to the
other. And how wise he was to suggest that all foxes have as many pups as possible! Little
did they realize that our kind hero Ben wanted to increase the fox population in order to
be able to feed the ever-hungry jackals. It really did not matter if the foxes to be
donated were old or sick. With a renewed supply of pups, any fox would do. What really
mattered was that Ben and his family flourished and became fatter and fatter.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Wall Of Blows</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Erik Paul</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is a wall in the centre of a Palestinian town that is covered with
bloodstains. The local residents tell hair-raising stories about people who have been
beaten there at the wall. Shopkeepers know all about it. It&#146;s in the back of the
al-Hatib carpet store.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shopkeepers in Manara Square say, &#147;Every day the Israeli soldiers
bring people over there, stand them against the wall, and beat, curse and kick them like
maniacs. Go to the hospital and see for yourselves!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am a freelance reporter who has been covering Israeli infringements
against the civilian Palestinian population. I wish you could come and let me take you to
the hospital to meet two brothers, Abdullah, age 30 and Ab&#146;d, 28. When I saw the
brothers, I noticed that Abdullah&#146;s left eye was very swollen and badly bruised. Last
Thursday, his brother Ab&#146;d was suffering from injuries all over his body. He was the
one who first spoke about the &#147;Wall of Blows&#148; in the centre of a Palestinian
town. He also told me and other reporters stories about the violence of the Israeli
soldiers, their meting out savage beatings with clubs and about how he was kicked and
humiliated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for Abdullah, his story resembles other accounts of many West Bank
residents. &#147;I was standing beside our furniture shop one morning when the soldiers
arrived,&#148; he told us. &#147;One of them jabbed a club into my stomach and punched me
in the face, throwing me down the steps. Believe me, I didn&#146;t do or say anything to
them. Not a single word...nothing. I was just standing there. They didn&#146;t even order
me to open the shop.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As we were talking, a youth of about 20, Mohammed Khalil, arrived at the
hospital. His mouth was totally disfigured and streaming with blood. His upper lip was
split open on one side and torn on the other, and his face was badly bruised. He was
incapable of speaking. His friends said he was arrested during a demonstration in the
centre of a Palestinian village and taken to the military government compound in the city.
From there, he was rushed to a hospital in the above-described condition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Two days ago,&#148; we were told, &#147;many injured persons were
brought to the hospital from a refugee camp. They came there from other areas to
participate in a human rights conference organized by the Palestinian human rights
organization, &#147;Law in the service of Man.&#148; A group of Western jurists visited
the camp so they could also participate in the conference.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some reporters and I were accompanying the jurists. We were horrified when
we saw a heap of ashes and charred furniture at the entrance of the camp in the vegetable
store of Mustafa Hamis, a camp resident. &#147;In order to resist the occupation,&#148;
Mustafa told us, &#147;children set tires on fire here on Friday. Then, a group of
soldiers came along. An officer took an iron bar and forced the door of my shop open and
dragged the burning tires into my shop and set my place on fire. When we asked him why he
was doing this, he said that every time a tire is burned, it would be dragged into
somebody&#146;s shop or home.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I took notes on what the translators were saying, I noticed that
members of the delegation were doing the same thing. But I wondered if all that they saw
would ever be reported and, if so, would anyone listen to the truth and the tragedy of
what happens on a daily basis here.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this particular refugee camp, you can see many residents whose arms are
bandaged or in slings. They show you bruised limbs and purple patches all over their
bodies and tell horrifying stories about acts of violence perpetrated by Israeli soldiers.
Yesterday was exceptionally brutal, the camp residents told us. We were taken to the
residence of an elderly woman whose face was lined with wrinkles. Jamilia, age 67, pointed
to bruises on the palms of her hands and wrists and related how she was savagely beaten
when she tried to protest because Israeli soldiers were beating her son in her own home.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then we were taken next door to the home of the Hamdan family. A young man
of 20, Abdul-Fattah, pointed to a large bandage covering a score of stitches on the top of
his head. &#147;I was sitting at home,&#148; he said, &#147;because soldiers confiscated
my I.D. card two weeks ago. All of a sudden, some Israeli soldiers entered and took me out
of the house. They beat me ruthlessly. One blow on my head left me with a deep gash and
covered me in blood. Then I was taken to a bus that was parked at the entrance to the camp
and they continued to beat me there. They stepped on me and kicked me. My mother ran to
where I was being beaten and screamed, &#145;Leave my son alone!&#146;&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We looked at his mother and noticed that her arm was bandaged in a cloth
sling. Her son continued, &#147;The soldiers did not listen to her and instead, began to
beat her, too, and broke her arm.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My fellow reporters and I left the camp. As we were leaving, we saw a
group of Israeli soldiers, among them were some senior officers, arrive at the camp.
Within seconds, a pack of small children, some not more than six or seven years old,
gathered at the entrance to the camp and started throwing whatever they could get their
hands on at the soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, the scenes of blood on the Wall of Blows, the old mothers who were
beaten, the charred stores, and the small children fighting for freedom dwell in the
forefront of my mind. I cannot forget any of the horrific things I witnessed. I think that
there is a Wall of Blows in every city in the Occupied Territories and in every household
and in every Palestinian heart. Now the Wall of Blows lives on in my heart and mind, too. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky</i></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Part 1</font></b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Introduction</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is a political book about Jewish fundamentalism in Israel. It
includes some original scholarly research but is based to a great extent upon the
scholarly research of others. Hopefully, this book is analytical.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have inserted in the text many and copious quotations from serious
articles that have appeared in the Israeli Hebrew press. The majority of articulate
Israeli Jews have learned about Jewish fundamentalism and some of the reactions thereto
during the past ten to fifteen years from these articles. Seine of these articles provided
summaries of and analyses by leading scholars who have researched in-depth aspects of
Jewish fundamentalism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have quoted and have usually explained texts from talmudic literature.
Such texts have been and still are often used in Israeli politics and often quoted in the
Israeli Hebrew press. We have concluded that in the usual English translations of talmudic
literature some of the most sensitive passages are usually toned down or falsified as a
result, we have ourselves translated all of the texts from talmudic literature that we
have quoted in the book. The quotations from the Bible, however, follow the standard
translations, sometimes in more modern English, except when specifically noted otherwise.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We realize that we have presented a number of lengthy quotations. We
determined that this was necessary in order to explain our points adequately. We believe
the quotations deserve to be and should be read in full. Instead of footnoting each
quotation separately in the traditional scholarly manner, we decided to mention in the
text from where each quotation was taken. Although this may at times appear to he a bit
redundant, it makes the flow of understanding easier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although our book deals primarily with recent developments in Jewish
fundamentalism, it is routed in Jewish history. A brief overview of Jewish history,
especially for readers who may lack adequate knowledge thereof, is necessary in order to
provide the contextual framework for the subject matter. Fundamentalists of all religions
wish to restore society to the &quot;good old times&quot; when the faith was allegedly
pure and was practiced by everyone. Fundamentalists believe that in the &quot;good old
times&quot; all the evils associated with modernity were absent. To gain an understanding
of Jewish fundamentalism, it is imperative to identify the historical period that
fundamentalists believe should be re-established. In order to do this, we must specify the
various periods of Jewish history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jewish history is usually divided into four major periods. The first is
the biblical period during which most of the Jewish Bible (Old Testament in the Christian
tradition) was written. Although its beginning time is uncertain, this period lasted until
about the fifth century BC. Judaism, at least in its major characteristics, did not exist
in this time period. The Hebrew word &quot;yehudim&quot; (&#147;Jews&quot; in
post-biblical Hebrew) and its cognates in the Jewish Bible only denotes the inhabitants of
the small kingdom of Judea and is used to distinguish these inhabitants from all the other
people, called Israelites or &quot;sons of Israel&quot; or, rarely, &quot;Hebrews.&quot;
The Bible anyway is not the book that primarily determines the practices and doctrines of
Orthodox Jews. The most fundamentalist Orthodox Jews are largely ignorant of major parts
of the Bible and know some parts only through commentaries that distort meaning.
Controversies, moreover, consumed the biblical period. The majority of Israelites,
including inhabitants of Judea, practiced idolatry throughout much of this period. Only a
minority of Israelites followed those tendencies from which Judaism subsequently arose. In
short,<sub> </sub>Judaism, as it came to be known, did not exist during the biblical
period.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second period of Jewish history, usually called the Second Temple
period, began in the fifth century BC and lasted until the destruction of the Second
Temple by the Romans in AD 70. This was the formative period of Judaism with its
subsequent characteristics. The term &quot;Jews,&quot; which denotes those people who
followed the distinctive religion of Judaism and the name Judea, which denotes the land
wherein Jews lived, appeared in this period. Near the end of this period, after Jews had
conquered most of Palestine, the Romans adopted the term &quot;Judea&quot; in describing
Palestine.<sup> </sup>The two most important new Jewish characteristics that developed in
this period were Jewish exclusiveness and the resultant separation of Jews from all other
nations. For the first time the persons of other nations were referred to by the
collective name of gentiles.<sup> </sup>The second new characteristic was based upon the
assumption that the Jews must follow biblical law,<sub> </sub>that is, the true
interpretation of the law. During most of this period, however, disputes centering upon
differing and rival interpretations of the law occurred. At times, these disputes erupted
into civil wars. The long-lasting quarrel between the Pharisees and Saducees was but one
example of such disputes. Shortly after the beginning of this period, Alexander the Great
conquered Palestine. States influenced by Hellenism ruled Palestine for almost a thousand
years thereafter; even the short-lived independent Jewish state of the Hasmonean dynasty
was in most essentials a type of Hellenistic state. Consequentially, Jewish society and
the Hebrew language,<sub> </sub>even though keeping their Jewish characteristics were
transformed by the influences of Hellenism. Hellenism influenced even more deeply the
Jewish diaspora in Mediterranean countries. Jews in those countries often spoke and prayed
in Greek. Unfortunately most of the Jewish literature in Greek, which was produced in this
period, was subsequently lost by the Jews; only that part preserved by various Christian
churches has remained.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most historians date the beginning of the third period in AD 70 with the
destruction of the Second Temple. Other historians prefer to date the beginning of the
third period in AD 135, when the last major Jewish rebellion against the Roman Empire
ended. This period ended at different times in different countries with the onset of
modernity and the rise of modern nation states. Modernity began when Jews were granted
rights as citizens equal to those granted to non-Jews and consequently when their
autonomy, which entailed subjection to the rabbis, ended. This occurred in the United
States and France, for example, by the end of the eighteenth century; this did not occur
in Russia until 1917 or in Yemen until the 1950s. The Jewish rebellions against the Romans
resulted in a permanent loss of Jewish population in Palestine; the importance of the
Jewish diaspora thus increased. This change became fully operative in the fifth century
AD. Additionally, the failure of rebellions caused the Jews to lose hope that the Temple
would be rebuilt and that the animal sacrifices performed in the Temple, previously the
heart-center of the Jewish religion) would be restored before the coming of the Messiah.
The repeated defeats caused most Jews to accommodate themselves to the ruling authority of
Rome and of other states in return for the limited autonomy directed by the rabbis. Thus,
in the Roman empire of the fourth century AD<b>, </b>in a system created much earlier) all
the Jews were in religious matters subject to the Patriarch who had the power to punish
them by flogging, by<b> </b>levying fines for religious offenses and by imposing taxes.
The dignitary called Patriarch in Roman sources was called President (&quot;Nassi&quot; in
Hebrew) in Jewish sources. He presided over the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish court, and
in Palestine appointed court members and other religious functionaries. The Patriarch,
whose post was hereditary, held a high official rank in the hierarchy of Roman stare
officials. A similar arrangement simultaneously existed in Iraq where the top official was
called the head of the diaspora. Both the patriarch and the head of the diaspora claimed
to have been descended from the family of King David. The office of the patriarch lapsed
shortly after AD 429; the office of the head -of the diaspora lasted until about AD<b> </b>1100.
Both offices provided the framework for models of Jewish autonomy. This autonomy, which
persisted until the modern era, and later repercussions thereof, contributed to the rise
of Jewish fundamentalism. The great abundance of literature produced in the third period,
the longest in the entire course of Jewish history, was written mostly in Hebrew but also
in Aramaic, Greek, Arabic, Yiddish and other languages. The major theme was religion; the
minutiae of religious observances were mainly emphasized. Poetry, philosophy and science,
predominantly of the Aristotelian variety, appeared at some times in some places but were
neither universal nor continuous. In many diaspora areas, particularly in central Europe,
the only literature produced until 1750 was religious. From the perspective of Jewish
fundamentalism the most important occurrence in the third period was the growth of Jewish
mysticism, usually referred to by the name of Cabbala. Jewish mysticism transformed Jewish
beliefs without changing, except for a few details, Jewish observance. Between 1550 and
1750, the great majority of Jews in western Europe accepted the Cabbala and its set of
beliefs. This was the end of the third period of Jewish history, which immediately
preceded the rise of modern nation states and the beginning of modern influences.
Mysticism is still accepted by and constitutes a vital part of Jewish fundamentalism,
being especially important in the messianic variety. As shown in our book, the ideology of
the messianic variety of Jewish fundamentalism is based upon the Cabbala. In spite of
making occasional references to the Bible, Jewish fundamentalists generally have
consistently pinpointed and described the last part of this third period as the golden age
that they wish to restore. It is important to note that, beyond the spawning of Jewish
fundamentalism, the wide circulation of religious literature in this third period created
a strong sense of Jewish unity, based upon a common religion and the Hebrew language.
(Almost all educated Jews, regardless of what language they spoke, understood and employed
Hebrew as a written language for their religion.)</p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fourth and modern period of Jewish history is the one in which we
live. It began at different times in different countries; many Israeli Jews passed
directly from pre-modern to modem times. As discussed in Chapter 3 of our book, this
phenomenon has been especially important for Oriental Jews. Our book emphasizes that
Jewish fundamentalism arose as a reaction against the effects of modernity upon Jews. The
influence of Jewish fundamentalism upon the Israeli Jewish community can only be
understood adequately within the context of the entire course of Jewish history.</font></p>
