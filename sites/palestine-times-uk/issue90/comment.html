<H3><CENTER>Crucial Questions</CENTER></H3>

<P>The repositioning of the Israeli occupation army from several
villages in the northern part of the West Bank was welcomed by
Yasser Arafat's supporters and hangers-on as a great victory-reminiscent
of the false euphoria induced by Arafat's false promises. Following
the signing of the infamous Oslo Accords, bands of PA police scoured
the streets of the newly &quot;liberated&quot; areas, chanting
allegiance for the &quot;ultimate leader&quot;.<BR>
Of course, no Palestinian is against the true liberation of any
part of our most dear land. This is an axiomatic truism.<BR>
However, when truth is clouded by diatribe about &quot;liberation
and freedom&quot;, one is morally called on to dissect truth from
falsehood because what is at stake is our homeland, Palestine.<BR>
The intention here is not to re-expose the scandals of Oslo and
its deformed offspring-agreements, understandings, memoranda and
what have you.<BR>
The intention is rather to remind the Palestinians and the world
that is cheering a leader for selling out his people's rights
in return for an airport strip and a flag while the West Bank
is being devoured by Israeli bulldozers.<BR>
Indeed, every Palestinian is now asking what is the point of having
final status talks when the subject of the these talks has largely
been predetermined?<BR>
It is known now that there are 194 Jewish settlements in the West
Bank occupying as much as 50% of West Bank territory.<BR>
Moreover, most of the land classified as &quot;Meri land&quot;,
e.g. State land, has either been confiscated for settlement expansion
or slated for confiscation.<BR>
And of Jerusalem, there is no point in pointing out that the Arab
Islamic town has virtually lost its original identity and is about
to become a completely Jewish town.<BR>
This is sad, even heart-rending, but it is reality.<BR>
In light of this bleak outlook, the Palestinians seemed destined
to have two broad alternatives, neither is easy.<BR>
First, saving (or salvaging) what can be saved and establishing
a State-let, a semi-State, or a quasi-State, on those parts of
the West Bank vacated by the Israeli army.<BR>
This obviously means that the bulk of the West Bank will remain
under Israeli control, including, of course, Jerusalem.<BR>
Moreover, the historical rights of the Palestinians in their historical
homeland (the refugees) would go into oblivion as the main stress
would be on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<BR>
Even the would-be &quot;State&quot; will be no more than just
a group of bantustans made up of a patchwork of towns and villages
without territorial continuity, a strange entity without coherence
that is dependent on and subservient to the Jewish State.<BR>
The worrying matter about this scenario is that some influential
people within the PA, perhaps including Arafat himself, don't
terribly object to coming to terms with a scenario as such &quot;if
all other doors are shut in our faces.&quot;<BR>
If true, the PA would effectively become a manifestly treacherous
entity and a quisling organization working in full daylight against
the Palestinian people's interests.<BR>
The second alternative takes the form of formally declaring Palestinian
Statehood on 4 May of next year as Arafat has been vowing, and
using the expected international recognition for the new State
as an additional asset for continuing the struggle.<BR>
This alternative is probably the soundest for the time-being provided
that the Palestinian people play it well and take its steps carefully.<BR>
The key task here is &quot;continuing the struggle&quot; because
&quot;a static State&quot; on 50% or 60% of the West Bank is a
miracle solution for the Zionist State since it would rid it of
the people while keeping the land.<BR>
Indeed, there are genuine fears the State would be rich in symbols
and poor, very poor, in substance.<BR>
The bitter experiences of having &quot;liberated areas&quot; that
are not the least free from Israeli repression-airports (the access
to which is controlled by Israeli soldiers) and all the trappings
of a State without any real authority-makes imperative on Palestinians
to remember the adage &quot;bitten once, shy twice&quot;.<BR>
The declaration of Statehood on 4 May must not be under any circumstances
understood as a culmination of the struggle, but rather as a resumption
of it.<BR>
Continuing the struggle will guarantee national unity in the face
of the occupier as it would leave the Oslo debacle behind us for
good.<BR>
But in any case, Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims ought to have
no illusion that the struggle will be anything but long and bitter,
if only because the Zionist State will not agree to give Palestinians
their due rights back just out of magnanimity.</P>
