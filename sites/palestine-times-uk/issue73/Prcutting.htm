<P> <FONT SIZE=+1>Helmet shield lifted and arms spread wide,  a broad-chested
Israeli sergeant, the biggest man in his squad, stood  exposed on Shalala
Street (Hebron of the West Bank) this afternoon and called to the young
 Palestinians heaving stones and flaming bottles of gasoline. &quot;Give
it to me in the eye!&quot; he roared in Hebrew, pantomiming his  challenge.
&quot;Give it to me in the ear!&quot; Two sharpshooters of his military
police squad, one high and one low,  crouched under cover nearby. Whenever
a torso or limb poked out from  behind makeshift Palestinian battlements,
the soldiers opened fire with  steel-cored rubber bullets. &quot;We did
good shooting today,&quot; said the sergeant's platoon leader, who  identified
himself only as Lt. Ron. &quot;Yes,&quot; affirmed a corporal, laughing
 nearby. &quot;You can check Alia Hospital.&quot; <B><I>Barton Gellman writes

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mustafa Diab, born and raised in East Jerusalem, went to
the  Israeli Interior Ministry seeking residency papers for his Jordanian
 wife and nine children. But instead of granting permits, an official  there
seized the identity card that allows Diab to live in Jerusalem and  gave
the Palestinian truck driver 15 days to leave the country. Two months later,
Diab's 11-year-old daughter died, and his request  for a death certificate
to bury her in the family plot in Jerusalem was  denied. No longer a legal
resident, Diab had no rights in Jerusalem, the  Israeli authorities told
him. &quot;I am destroyed,&quot; Diab said. &quot;How can I describe it?
They kicked me  out of my homeland, and I cannot do anything about it.&quot;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With Palestinians increasingly losing faith in PLO Chairman
Yasser  Arafat and in American mediation, Gen. Uzi Dayan, operations commander
 of Israel's central army command, charged that up to a third of the Arab
 demonstrators clashing with Israelis were brought in from villages  outside
Hebron. Asked if the rioters were being directed or encouraged by Arafat's
 self-rule Palestinian Authority, Dayan replied, &quot;I can make an educated
 guess.&quot; Israel Radio, quoting other security sources, said Friday
that Israel  believes the Palestinian Authority is, in fact, instigating
the  violence, a charge PLO officials deny. <B><I>Storer H. Rowley writes

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>ISRAEL'S prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, survived a
no-confidence vote last night, but the price of his political survival is
likely to be a further downward lurch in the sinking Middle East peace process.
Mr. Netanyahu's embattled right-wing coalition won the vote by 55 votes
to 50, after ensuring the support of new Russian immigrants by offering
them financial assistance in an eleventh-hour deal on Monday night. But
the vote exposed significant erosion in the prime minister's authority.
Eleven coalition members either abstained or stayed away, including the
foreign minister, David Levy, and his supporters, and the former finance
minister, Dan Meridor. &quot;Another front has opened against Netanyahu,&quot;
said Ari Shavit, a political commentator. &quot;There is a sense this thing
is disintegrating. This is non-confidence from the heart of the party.&quot;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An investigation by The Independent has revealed that most
of the American bombs and air-to-ground missiles fired by Israel in Lebanon
last year were sold to the United States armed forces - not to Israel. Israel's
&quot;Operation Grapes of Wrath&quot; - the bombardment of southern Lebanon
that killed almost 200 civilians and 14 guerrillas from the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah - used at least 1,700 bombs and missiles that were &quot;transferred&quot;
from US military stocks with no prohibition on their use against civilians...
The Israeli pilot who targeted the ambulance on 18 April last year - the
Israelis claimed it was being driven by a member of the Hizballah guerrilla
movement which was untrue - had in fact fired two missiles at the vehicle.
One of them failed to detonate and the unexploded rocket revealed a complete
set of code numbers which - according to our defence sources - proved that
the missile was contracted for use by the US armed forces in 1986 and manufactured
in 1988. <B><I>Robert Fisk writes from Washington- The Independent, June
