<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Political Prostitution in Washington</FONT></H3>

<P>     <FONT SIZE=+1>Two recent classic examples of political prostitution
came from Washington, D.C., the capital of the nefarious &quot;new world
order.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The first came from the Speaker of the Senate, Newt
Gingrich, who claimed that the prohibition  by the Palestinian Authority
of land sales to Jewish settlers was a Nazi-like behaviour. The second example
took the form of a House of Representative decision recognizing occupied
Jerusalem as &quot;Israel's united and divided capital.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     As for Gingrich's remarks, it is sufficiently obvious
that his charade was not motivated by genuine human rights concerns pertaining
to the killing of innocent human beings by a despotic authority. As we all
know, Palestinian Authority police have killed, or tortured to death, over
15 innocent detainees since the instalment of Yasser Arafat's administration
in Gaza and Jericho more than three years ago. Interestingly, none of these
murders moved &quot;Gingrich's conscientious concerns about human rights.&quot;
Moreover,  the truly Nazi-like behaviour of Israeli soldiers and Jewish
settlers in the West Bank (like beating Palestinian children to death) doesn't
seem worthy of his morbid attention because the victims happen to have the
&quot;wrong blood&quot; and bear the &quot;wrong names.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Putting his malicious intent aside, Gingrich's remarks
demonstrate a great deal of ignorance. At best, they are characteristic
of a man whose tongue functions much more swiftly than his mind does. The
loose-lipped Gingrich should have done some homework before he uttered his
misbegotten words. He should have known that if any group of people in Palestine
can be likened to the Nazis, it is the Jewish settlers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     He should have known that there are hundreds of thousands
who unashamedly believe that &quot;Jewish blood is redder than non-Jewish
blood (including Gingrich's, of course) and that their lives are therefore
preferred by the Lord.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The ostensibly politically-correct Gingrich should
have known that the Israeli authorities are running, as always, concentration
camps in several areas of the West Bank, including Meggido prison, in which
Palestinian detainees are tormented to death or made to live an enduring
hell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The miserable speaker should have known that there
are ministers serving in the Israeli government (like Rafael Etan and Areil
Sharon) who do not hesitate to use exactly the same words in describing
Arabs that the Nazis used to describe Jews.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Indeed, would Mr. Gingrich like to come to Hebron
to meet Jewish settlers who would readily describe themselves as &quot;Nazi
Jews&quot;?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     It is always good to defend human rights. This is
a sublime duty, to say the least. However, one should defend human rights
for the right reason, lest one be ensnared by hypocrisy and expediency considerations.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Needless to say, it is very hypocritical to seek to
appease the Jewish lobby, which seems to strike terror in Gingrich's heart,
by falsifying facts and making corrupt analogies with the intent of  harming
 an oppressed people like the Palestinians. Or does Gingrich want to vindicate
the oft-voiced premise that &quot;America is the tormentor of the Palestinians.&quot;<BR>
