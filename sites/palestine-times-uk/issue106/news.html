<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinians reaffirm their attachment <br>
to homeland on Land day</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh </b></p>

<p>Palestinians in Palestine and the Diaspora observed on 30 March the annual anniversary
of &#147;Yawm al Ardh&#148; or &#147;Land Day,&#148; by reaffirming and reasserting their
attachment to their occupied homeland and determination to deliver Palestine from the
shackles of the Zionism.<br>
The Land Day anniversary acquired particular significance this year as Israel and the
Palestinian Authority continued to hold open and secret talks over the fundamental issues
of the Palestinian question, such as the future of Jerusalem, the fate of more than four
million refugees awaiting for<br>
more than fifty years repatriation.<br>
The anniversary also comes as the confiscation of private Arab land continues on both
sides of the green line, a sinister racist practice that never stopped ever since the
Zionist regime was established in Palestine in 1948.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Protests in Nablus<br>
</b></u>As in previous years, Palestinians marked the anniversary with massive
demonstrations, parades, rallies and clashes with Israeli occupation soldiers.<br>
The most violent clashes took place in the town of Nablus, where as many as 10,000 people
took to the streets, chanting anti-Zionist slogans affirming the right of the dispossessed
Palestinians to repatriation and restitution.<br>
&#147;We shall never come to terms with the arrogation of our homeland,&#148; read one of
the large placards carried by the demonstrators.<br>
Another sign read &#147; Israel shall never enjoy a moment of peace as long as a
Palestinian child is alive.&#148;<br>
Much of the activity in Nablus was carried out by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
as the movement&#146;s leadership had earlier called on supporters to participate heavily
in rallies and protests marking Land Day.<br>
Around one hundred masked Hamas supporters torched the Israeli flag, vowing to continue
the struggle and holy Jihad until &#147;we get our full right back.&#148;<br>
&#147;Palestine is in our hearts, Palestine is al Msjidul Aqsa (Aqsa Mosque), it is the
third holiest Islamic shrine after the Holy Ka&#146;aba and the Prophet&#146;s Mosque in
Madina. Hence, Palestine is part of our Islamic belief,&#148; said one masked man, reading
from a prepared text.<br>
Many demonstrators marched toward the nearby Zionist colony of Alon Moreh, where the
Israeli occupation authorities have been seeking to seize additional Arab land to expand
the settlement.<br>
There, the demonstrators hurled stones on Israeli soldiers, who responded with firing
rubber bullets and tear gas, injuring as many as 20 people.<br>
Most of the injured sustained light injuries and were released from hospital, according to
local hospital sources.<br>
In Ramallah, Hebron, and Bethlehem, Palestinian youngsters stoned Israeli occupation
soldiers with stones, forcing Israeli vehicles to travel through bypass roads.<br>
Moreover, Israeli settlers in much of the West Bank were told to stay in-door lest they be
attacked by Palestinians.<br>
In Jerusalem, a demonstration at Ras al Amud, where a Jewish colony is being built,
attracted only hundreds of participants, in contrast to the organizers&#146; promises.<br>
The demonstration was organized by the chief PLO man in East Jerusalem, Faisal Huseini, a
traditional supporter of Yaser Arafat. <br>
Observers said the low turnout was probably a reflection of mounting public disenchantment
with Arafat&#146;s regime.<br>
Earlier on the day, Arafat himself addressed Palestinians through the PA-run radio and
television.<br>
He called on Palestinians everywhere to &#147;unite in order safeguard our holy homeland
in face of the forces of oppression and aggression.&#148;<br>
<br>
<u><b>Across the Green Line <br>
</b></u>In 1948-Palestine (Israel), the one million-strong Arab community observed the
Land Day with massive rallies in all major Arab towns and villages.<br>
In Sakhnin, where the original Land Day came into being a quarter of a century ago,
thousands of Palestinians held a big rally during which Palestinian flags were raised.<br>
The demonstrators were soon attacked by police and special police forces, using tear gas
and rubber-coated bullets.<br>
At least 25 protesters were injured, one of them seriously.<br>
The &#147;muwajahat&#148; or clashes lasted for four hours, as crack border police
soldiers traced the protesters into the town, using tear-gas into populated areas.<br>
At the town of Um al Fahem, in the southern Triangle, thousands of townspeople planted
olive trees at al Rawha, an adjacent area the Israeli army has been seeking to seize from
its owners.<br>
In 1998, fierce clashes erupted between the people of Um al Fahem and Israeli occupation
troops, forcing the Israeli government of Benyamin Netanyahu to suspend an order to
confiscate the land.<br>
The Land Day commemorates the killing by the Israeli army of six Palestinians at the
village of Sakhnin on 30 March, 1976. <br>
The Palestinians were then protesting the expropriation of their lands in the Galilee by
the Israeli government for the purpose of expanding Jewish settlements in the region.<br>
Since then, Land Day has become a symbol of Palestinian determination to<br>
resist the theft of their land, which has been going unabated since the establishment of
Israel in 1948.<br>
Hundreds, probably thousands, of other Palestinians have since then been killed, maimed or
made homeless in the fight to retain Palestinian land.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Land: the crux of the matter<br>
</b></u>Indeed, the land is the crux of the matter of the Palestinian question.<br>
Even the Zionists themselves admit that grabbing Palestinian land, often at gun point, is
neither legal, nor moral, nor just.<br>
One Zionist writer, Y. Ben Porat, a well-known writer wrote in 1972 that &#147;One truth
is that there is no Zionism, no settlement, no Jewish state, without the evacuation of
Arabs and confiscation and enclosure of their land.&#148;<br>
Even David Ben-Guirion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, recognized, in his own way,
the injustice the Zionists meted out to the Palestinians.<br>
He wrote in 1949 &#147;why should the Arabs make peace? If I were an Arab leader, I would
never make terms with Israel. That is natural. We have taken their country. Sure, God
promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. They only see
one thing: we came here and stole their country. Why should they accept that ?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - Amid heavy security, the Pope of the Vatican, Pope
John Paul II, paid a courtesy visit on Sunday, 26 March, to al-Haram al-Sharif of
Jerusalem, the Muslim world&#146;s third holiest shrine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ikrema Sabri, and several Muslim Ulema
(scholars), as well as several Jerusalemite leaders, including PLO Jerusalem official
Faisal Husseini, received the Pope.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Supreme Muslim Council of Jerusalem, which oversees Islamic holy
places in the city, called on the Pope to do all he could to end the Israeli occupation of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri told the Pope that without ending the Israeli occupation of
Jerusalem, there would be no peace or justice or stability in this part of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is an occupied land which Israel seized in 1967,&#148; Sabri
told the Pope.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There will be no peace, no security, no stability in the absence of
justice, and justice will not be achieved until this city of ours is made free.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Pope responded to Sabri&#146;s remarks, saying the followers of the
three monotheistic religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) should be able to live
together in peace and tranquillity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian officials earlier handed the Pope a petition, urging him to
work toward ending the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition was symbolically signed by hundreds of Jerusalemite notables,
Muslim and Christian alike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During his visit to the Holy Land, the Pope refrained from making explicit
political statements favouring either Israel or the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During his visit to the Deheisheh refugee camp outside Bethlehem on
Wednesday, 22 March, the Pope refrained from making an explicit reference to the
Palestinian refugees&#146; right of return to their homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He instead spoke of the refugees&#146; right to live in a homeland and
earn a decent living, a statement that did not meet Palestinian expectations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday, 26 March, the Pope visited al-Buraq Wall, which the Jews call
the Western Wall.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There, the Pope read a printed and signed copy of a plea for forgiveness
that he made at the Vatican earlier this month for the historic sins of Christians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We are deeply saddened by the behaviour of those who in the course
of history have caused these children of yours to suffer and, asking your forgiveness, we
wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the People of the Covenant.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jews pray at the Wall to mourn the destruction of the First and Second
Temples and insert written prayers and supplications to God into crevices between the
stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Pope was heckled by extremist Jews who protested at the &#147;Wailing
Wall being made impure by the presence of the Pope.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least two Jews were arrested as they were carrying torn-up Vatican
flags and other anti-Christian signs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 March 1999, the Pope made a pilgrimage to the Holocaust Memorial
Museum in West Jerusalem. On 25 March of the same year, the Pope asked Israel to rescind a
license granted to Muslims to build a mosque opposite the Church of the Annunciation in
the Arab town of Nazareth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mosque is slated to be built on land belonging to the Muslim Wakf, but
Christians have voiced worries that the planned mosque would undermine the dominating
presence of the towering church. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslim officials and dignitaries received the Pope and in deference to him
cancelled a prayer-demonstration at a Tabariya mosque that Muslims are trying to recover
from the Israeli authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel confiscated hundreds of mosques in 1948 and converted many of them
into museums or bars, offending Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Pope returned to Rome on 26 March, ending one of his most important
visits abroad.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Internally displaced Palestinian refugees <br>
re-affirm right of return</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Saturday, 11 March, internally displaced Palestinians in pre-1967
Palestine (Israel) joined Palestinian refugee communities in exile to reaffirm their right
of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;No peace with Israel without the implementation of our right to
return to our homes and properties&#148; is the demand which mobilizes not only millions
of Palestinian refugees in the Arab world and the West, but also the approximately 250,000
Palestinians who have remained&#151;displaced and disowned&#151;inside 1948-Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The public Rally for the Right of Return, organized by the National
Committee for the Defense of the Rights of the Internally Displaced in the sports hall of
the Nazareth municipality, was attended by some 850 participants, including activists from
displaced communities, Palestinian political parties and movements, representatives of
Palestinian local councils and public institutions in Israel, as well as solidarity
delegations from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, refugee camps in the occupied West
Bank and the PLO. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hundreds of letters of support sent by Palestinian parties, institutions
and activists in all parts of Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Kuwait and Canada, as well as the
statements of the speakers at the Return Rally, namely Ramiz Jeraiyseh/Mayor of Nazareth,
Muhammad Zeidan/Head of the Arab Monitoring Committee, Abdelhakim Al-Zreikhi/PLO Refugee
Department, Jamal Shati/PLC, Salman Fakhr Al-Din/Syrian community in the Golan Heights,
and Muhammad Jaradat/BADIL, addressed two major common themes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. The determination of Palestinian refugees and those internally
  displaced to continue the struggle for their right of return (&#147;with my teeth I will
  cling to my land...&#148; in the words of the late Palestinian poet Tawfiq Zayyad), which
  is expressed in the current series of popular conferences and rallies launched in all
  parts of Palestine: al-Far&#146;ah (1995), Bethlehem (1996), Gaza (1996), Tulkarem (1999),
  and in Nazareth (1995 and 2000);</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">2. The need for united Palestinian action towards a solution of the
  Palestinian refugee question&#151;the core issue of the Palestinian/Arab-Israeli
  conflict&#151;based on the implementation of international law and United Nations
  resolutions, in particular UN resolution 194 (Right of Return). </p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a step towards the required united action, Mayor Jeraiyseh announced on
behalf of the Arab Monitoring Committee that the right of return of internally displaced
Palestinians will feature as the central issue of the public events organized on this
year&#146;s Palestinian Land Day (30 March 2000).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Attorneys Wakim Wakim and Suleiman Fahmawi, speaking on behalf of the
National Committee for the Defense of the Internally Displaced, presented the
Committee&#146;s Manifesto and clarified that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. The National Committee is the representative of the internally
  displaced Palestinians in Israel, while the PLO is the sole representative of the
  Palestinian people, including internally displaced Palestinians. Any political agreement
  signed by the PLO with Israel that excludes the right of return will be considered null
  and void by refugees and the internally displaced;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Israel continues to violate the basic rights of its Palestinian
  citizens, not only their right to property is denied, but even their right to vote and
  their right to a candidate is being questioned. Expectations of a gradual democratization
  of Israel are thus based on illusions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The speakers of the National Committee called for broad support of the
internally displaced by all Palestinian social and political institutions, for the
immediate adoption of the file of the internally displaced by the Palestinian leadership,
and for a joint and intensive effort at documentation of Palestinian evictions and
displacement during the 1948 Nakba.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli guest speaker Tedi Katz summarized his research findings on the
previously poorly documented Israeli massacre in the Palestinian village of Tantura.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He drew the attention of the audience to the fact that the mosque and
graveyard of Tantura were ploughed and transformed into a sea-side parking lot, a measure
which strongly contradicts Israeli sensitivity to the desecration of Jewish graveyards all
over the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He emphasized that no Israeli government interested in peace will be able
to escape the refugee question and reminded the audience that accurate documentation of
destroyed villages and lost properties is a precondition for a strong Palestinian argument
and negotiations in the future. If the history of the 530 Palestinian villages destroyed
and depopulated in 1948 is not recorded now, while eyewitnesses are still alive, they will
be lost forever.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Rally&#146;s cultural programme expressed Palestinian refugees&#146;
determination to return in emotional terms. The Saffouri-dance theatre group gave an
artistic account of the search for a lost village.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Deheishe camp&#146;s IBDA&#146;A children again succeeded to move the
audience by depicting Palestinian persistence in their struggle against all odds, as well
as the power of the young Palestinian generation, ready to take up and complete the cause
of their parents and ancestors. </p>

Killing of a Palestinian Woman</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Hebron- PT</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At midnight, 20 March 2000, Halima Abdel Aziz Al-Aloul (Al-Sharouf), 45,
mother of 12 children, was killed by the Israeli Occupation Forces in the Hebron District
in the West Bank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She was shot by Israeli soldiers in the area between the two villages of
Kharas and Sourif. The soldiers were reportedly reservists from the settlement of Kiryat
Arba&#146;a whom the Israeli army allowed to erect roadblocks and checkpoints on roads
used by Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers of Kiryat Arba&#146;a, as indeed the rest of the Jewish
settlers everywhere in the West Bank, are considered among the most murderous of the
Jewish community, as they are indoctrinated to hate non-Jews in general and Palestinians
in particular.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the affidavit submitted to Palestinian human rights
organization al-Haq, based in Ramallah, her husband, Mohammad Ibrahim Al-Tous, 48,
approached a military checkpoint between Kharas and Sourif known as the Wadi al-Aazaz. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As he neared the checkpoint, he realized he did not have his insurance
document for the car, so he sought to turn back from the checkpoint.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At this point, the soldiers/settlers fired at least 20 rounds at the car,
without any warning to stop.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His wife, seated in the passenger seat, was hit six times in the back,
head, chest and neck. She died immediately and was later taken to the hospital for an
autopsy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the same time, the husband was also shot in the back. Al-Tous drove 1
kilometre before he fainted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Citizens took him to the Al-Ahli Hospital in Hebron to the surgery unit to
remove the bullet; however, they could not find it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He was injured in the liver and other internal organs by bullet fragments.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, the Israeli occupation authorities claimed the car was intent
on running over the soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, later on, probably under media pressure, the Zionists began a
token investigation into the incident. The soldiers were neither arrested nor prosecuted,
and were reportedly transferred to another locality to carry out policing duty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Soldiers saw the occupants of the car</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Al-Tous, the soldiers were able to see the occupants of the
car, given that it was close to a military checkpoint, which itself is fully lit and there
was a full moon. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is even more reprehensible is that the soldiers allowed the driver to
continue driving for 1 kilometre knowing that injuries were inflicted to the occupants of
the car. Shooting at civilians without warning is a violation of the principles and
minimum international standards regarding the use of firearms. The intention of the
soldier(s) was to obviously shoot to kill.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The murder of al-Sharouf coincided with the visit by Pope John Paul II to
Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jewish settlers have committed numerous crimes against the civilian
Palestinian population in the Hebron area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1983, for example, settlers dressed in military uniforms stormed the
Islamic college in Hebron, killing two Shariah students and injuring many others. The
Israeli occupation authorities then claimed the perpetrators were Palestinians and that
the car they were driving carried Arab license plates. The murderers were later
apprehended and spent a few years in jail before they were pardoned by the former Israeli
President Haim Herzog.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American Jewish immigrant from Brooklyn,
committed his gruesome massacre of Palestinian worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.
Twenty-nine worshipers were instantly killed and scores were injured. The settlers of
Kiryat Arba&#146;a erected a marbled memorial plaque around Goldstein&#146;s grave at the
settlement. Extremist Jews from around the world make pilgrimage to the site.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian councillors admit Arafat is <br>
the biggest obstacle to democracy in Palestine</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Dura (West Bank)-</strong> Palestinian Legislative Council members
representing Fatah, the mainstream faction of the PLO, admitted during a public meeting in
Dura on 12 March that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat remains the &#147;main
obstacle to democracy in Palestine.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Responding to a torrent of angry questions and criticisms by citizens
disenchanted with the PA regime, three Council members admitted, ostensibly under audience
pressure, that Arafat was impeding democracy and the separation of power, and that
Palestinians had little hope of genuine political reform as along as Arafat was alive.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muhammed al-Hurani, a veteran Fatah leader, admitted that &#147;democracy
in Palestine couldn&#146;t prosper and flourish under present circumstances.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked to clarify what he meant by &#147;present circumstances,&#148;
Hurani said, &#147;You know no President would volunteer to give up some of his powers and
our President is no exception.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hurani said he and his fellow councillors were trying to &#147;snatch our
rights from him (Arafat) little by little, step by step, occasionally using gentle words
and resorting to tacit pressure if necessary.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked why the Legislative Council has not succeeded in bringing about the
much-needed separation of powers, Hurani said, &#147;You know&#133;we are a third world
country; we are not in Sweden.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;But we struggled for 30 years, and justifying the lack of freedom by
the fact that we are a third world country is just unconvincing&#133;There are many third
world countries that have a flourishing democracy; India has a democracy, poor countries
in the heart of Africa have a democracy. Besides, our enemy, Israel, has a democracy of
her own&#133;so why can&#146;t we have democracy and have freedom of speech and an
independent judiciary?&#148; retorted an angry citizen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another councillor, Minister of Transport Ali al-Kawasmeh, sought to
glorify the &#147;Palestinian democracy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Look everywhere around us in the Arab world&#133;do they have a
similar level of freedom of speech as we do?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, another person from the audience interrupted him saying,
&#147;You think after all these years of suffering and struggle we should be compared to
these police States around us&#133;we want real freedom and real democracy, and if Syria
or Iraq is your model, please don&#146;t try to impose it on us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kawasmeh retorted by arguing that, &#147;Democracy has its limits and one
has to be careful and be sure about what he says and writes.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, a citizen retorted saying, &#147;It seems that your knowledge of
democracy is similar to my knowledge of the Japanese language. In a democracy, the courts,
not the police, decide whether something said or written is legal or illegal&#133;Here,
everything is in the hand of one person, he is Abu Ammar (PA Chairman Yasser Arafat), he
is the President, he is the judiciary, he is the police, he is the Palestinian
Authority.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the expiry of the Council&#146;s term, many citizens confronted the
three councillors with the fact that the Legislative Council was no longer legal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the councillors, Suleiman Abu Sneineh, a lawyer, said the
dissolution of the Council now would benefit Israel, pointing out that the current Council
achieved international recognition, arguing that it was foolhardy to scrap all of this
now.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On hearing this, one citizen asked sarcastically, &#147;Do you think we
are a bunch of dummies here&#133;why are you insulting our intelligence like this&#133;in
every democracy, when the term of a Legislative Council expires&#133;a new election is
organized&#133;.I wonder how many more years we have to wait until the open-ended term of
your damned Council will end.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Oslo Accords, the raison d&#146;être of the PA, the term
of the PA, its President Yasser Arafat, and the Legislative Council end upon the
expiration of the accords on 4 May, 1999.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jeruslaem-</strong> On 18 February, the notorious secret
police of the Palestinian Authority arrested Dr. Abdul Sattar Qassem, a Political Science
professor at the Najah National University in Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since then, Qassem has been held without charge or trial in a Jericho
prison, where some security elements said he is being mistreated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Family sources said Qassem was in need of medical care. So far, his lawyer
and human rights representatives have been barred from visiting him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem has been an outspoken critic of the Palestinian Authority and the
overall Oslo process, which he described as a sell-out of Palestinian rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1995, Qassem was shot four times by pro-Arafat gunmen, who sought to
serve him a warning to &#147;shut up or else...&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His latest book, The Road to Defeat, blasts Arafat for putting up with
widespread corruption within the Authority and for not doing anything to curb human rights
violations by his security forces.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During October of 1999, Qassem co-signed a petition blasting the
performance of the PA at every conceivable level. The petition, dubbed as
&#147;Petition-20&#148;, drew widespread reactions from Palestinians inside Palestine and
in the Diaspora.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petitioners specifically laid blame on Arafat, breaking a
well-established taboo in Palestine. On 27 November, 1,000 copies of the petition were
distributed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the petition was released, Qassem was arrested by Arafat&#146;s
secret police. He was the first of 11 petitioners to be arrested. The remaining nine
petitioners could not be arrested owing to the immunity given them as members of the
Palestinian Legislative Council. One petitioner who was not arrested, Mo&#146;awya
Al-Masr, a member of the Council, was shot three times. Abdul Jawad Salah, also a Council
member, was severely beaten by the police.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem and another co-signer from the Dura area, Ahmed Shaker Dudin,
received the lion&#146;s share of mistreatment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While in jail, Qassem was interrogated by the Attorney-General of the
Palestinian Authority, Khaled Al-Kidra, himself a target of corruption allegations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem was threatened with trial by a military court.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By January 2000, though, all of those arrested were released without
charges being filed after they pledged to appear in court if summoned or face a $70,000
fine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem started teaching in the new semester soon after his release. Then
the secret police arrested him again on 18 February.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem stated that he was never physically abused during his first arrest,
but reports by the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the
Environment suggest that he is not as lucky this time and is being tortured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem was released in January only to defuse mounting political pressure.
Now, as things have quieted down, the Palestinian Authority has decided to settle the
score.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not exactly known why Qassem was re-arrested. But sources close to
the security agencies suggest that the arrest has to do with Qassem&#146;s attacks on the
personal leadership of Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Qassem has been quite outspoken in criticizing the autocratic
style of Arafat&#146;s leadership, saying this leadership has caused untold harm to the
Palestinian people and their cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem, though, never did anything or committed any offense that violates
the written laws of the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is all too clear that the PA is an autocratic police State
(without a State), and non-conformists are persecuted, arrested and might even get killed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem is a brave fighter for liberty, human rights and civil liberties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He should be let down.</p>

self-rule areas</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Hebron (West Bank)-</strong> The Palestinian Authority (PA) has
continued to crack down on press freedom within the autonomous enclaves. The following two
recent incidents shed light on this.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Saturday, 25 March, the administrative governor of Hebron, Abdul Fattah
al-Jueidi, summoned to his office at &#147;al-Mukata&#146;a&#148; a number of local
cameramen who work for international news agencies and television networks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources, Jueidi questioned the cameramen
concerning their coverage and filming of the riots at the Deheishe refugee camp near
Bethlehem, which occurred on Wednesday, 22 March, immediately following the papal visit to
the camp.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One cameraman intimated that Jueidi warned them against &#147;exposing us
and making us the laughing-stock of the world.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He reportedly described the videotape images of the riots as
&#147;scandalous&#148; and &#147;besmirching the image of the Palestinian Authority and
the Palestinian people as a whole.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The cameramen reportedly undertook not to film scenes deemed detrimental
to Palestinian national interests &#147;as defined by the PA.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, the PA reportedly ordered the printed and electronic media
throughout the West Bank not to cover the Deheishe riots in which as many as 80 people
were hurt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second incident took place on 21 March when PA General Intelligence
(GI) officers in Hebron summoned Khalid Amayreh for questioning in connection with an
internet posting in which the Hebron-based journalist described in detail how he had been
questioned by GI officers on 11 February regarding &#147;non-conformist news and
view&#148; in the local weekly, Akhbar al-Khalil (Hebron Times), which Amayreh edits.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amayreh said the officers this time were &#147;more unfriendly than the
previous time.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Two of them used very abusive and obscene language,&#148; said
Amayreh.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amayreh said the questioning was &#147;more acrimonious&#148; than before
and lasted for close to three hours. </p>

&#147;the hegemony of the executive power.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Speaking during a Democracy-day forum at the village of Kufr Nima near

people were duty-bound to protect the Council from the excesses and hegemony of the
executive power.</p>

house.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Hananiya stuttered and sought to evade the subject when a citizen
asked him who was attacking the Council and whether he was alluding to Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another lawmaker, Qaddura Fares, exhorted the audience to accept the PA as
it is, arguing that it was the product of years of struggle and suffering.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fares was confronted with angry reactions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some in the audience asked him, &#147;Do you mean we should condone all
this corruption and lawlessness&#133;just because some people within the PA had a history
of struggle?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> An Arab member of the Israeli parliament (the
Knesset) attacked the Israeli justice system, saying discrimination between Arabs and Jews
was assuming flagrant proportions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hashem Mahamid of the United Arab List castigated the justice
system&#146;s policy of using double standards when dealing with Arab and Jewish
prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that a life sentence for a Jew in reality means a few
years, while it means &#147;imprisonment till death&#148; for an Arab.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;A Jewish prisoner often receives a commuted sentence, a pardon or
parole and is allowed family visits, but an Arab prisoner is denied these rights and is
not allowed even to walk in his father&#146;s funeral or visit his grave.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mahamid said the situation of Arab political prisoners in Israel was
particularly appalling.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said the prison conditions of those prisoners were much worse than the
conditions of Jewish prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mahamid said the Israeli justice system and Israeli officials did not deal
with these issues based on the principle of justice and equality for all but on the basis
of race.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> A Palestinian source revealed that the
assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had offered Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat a small State in Gaza and Jericho in 1995.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA semi-official daily al-Haya al-Jadida quoted the unidentified
high-ranking source as saying that in 1995 Rabin proposed that Arafat &#147;immediately
declare a Palestinian State in Gaza and Jericho in which case Israel would lend
recognition to it.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The source said Rabin told Arafat then that declaring a Palestinian State
would make the peace process much easier since the negotiations between the two sides
would be between two States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian source reportedly described Rabin&#146;s offer as
&#147;lacking cohesion.&#148;</p>

<p>According to the report, Arafat did not respond either positively or negatively to the
