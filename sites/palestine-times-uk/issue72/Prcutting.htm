<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian security forces have arrested six West Bank
Arabs on suspicion of selling land to Jews..The arrests are the latest actions
in an intensifying campaign to halt such sales, described by Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat as the work of &quot;traitors.&quot; Palestinian
Justice Minister Freih abu Medeen this month announced that any Arab who
sold land to Jews could face execution. Palestinians, including Arafat,
defend the policy as necessary to block the spread of Israeli settlements
on occupied land, an issue that has become especially pointed since Israel
started work in March on a housing project in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.<B><I>The

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That Mr. Kuttab (Palestinian-American writer arrested last
month by Mr. Arafat's PA ) is a U.S. citizen of course does not make his
arrest any more repugnant than the authority's jailing and torturing of
other journalists, intellectuals and free thinkers. Fourteen Palestinians
have died under torture by Palestinian Authority police. This march toward
a police state is doubly sad because it is so unnecessary. Mr. Arafat assumed
office with a popular mandate, broad international support and an opportunity
to prove that Arab democracy is not an oxymoron. But Mr. Kuttab's arrest,
if not morally worse, is certainly more tactically stupid than many of the
authority's other moves. At a time when political smarts would suggest that
Mr. Arafat should be playing the role of spurned negotiating partner, he
chooses instead to revive and exacerbate all the old questions about himself.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We were wrong. We Palestinians were wrong about Yasser
Arafat and the &quot;national authority&quot; that he has foisted on the
autonomous zones he controls in the West Bank and Gaza.. Not quite four
years ago we watched this man on the White House lawn as he signed the Oslo
agreement and shook hands effusively all around. The overwhelming majority
of Palestinians rejoiced at the spectacle. This was to be our first step
toward statehood, our chance, at last, to be the determining force in our
destiny.. Yasser Arafat arrived in Gaza in 1994 with a group of men carrying
not shovels but guns. He created nine intelligence services and a police
force of well over 30,000 men, presumably more policemen per capita than
any country in the world. <B><I>Fawaz Turki, a Palestinian writer living

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the figures, which were last updated in February,
25 percent of the homes in West Bank (Jewish) settlements are empty, and
50 percent in the Gaza Strip are empty. In the Golan Heights, 25 percent
of homes in Jewish settlements are vacant, and 5 percent are vacant in Jewish
neighborhoods built in East Jerusalem, according to the data.There are approximately
140,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It could not be
learned how many Israelis live in the Golan Heights or in the Jewish neighborhoods
of East Jerusalem.. Israeli settlement activity has been a major obstacle
to the resumption of stalled negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
The talks broke down in March when the Israelis began work on a new Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem, setting off Palestinian street riots and
the bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe. <B><I>New York Times, May 21, 1997</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clinton's special Middle East coordinator, Dennis Ross,
returned home last weekend empty handed from his third recent visit to the
region to try to break the impasse.. &quot;There are no quick fixes to this
situation,&quot; declared U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk... &quot;This
is because the core bargain of Oslo has broken down. Israelis were promised
security; Palestinians were promised self-government and a credible pathway
to negotiating their rights in a final-status agreement.&quot; <B><I>The
Chicago Tribune, May 20, 1997</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel has informed the United States that an intercepted
conversation between Israeli intelligence agents that led the FBI to suspect
a senior U.S. official was passing sensitive information to Israel was an
innocent reference to above-board channels of cooperation, according to
officials from both countries. The account marks the first formal effort
by Israel to explain its position in the case. It was transmitted to the
U.S. government last week through normal intelligence-sharing channels in
Washington, the officials said. <B><I>The Washington Post , May 17 1997<BR>
