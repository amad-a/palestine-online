<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Corruption is Modus Operandi</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>of PA Financial Administration- Report</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rampant corruption and financial mismanagement have become
the &quot;norm&quot; rather than the &quot;exception&quot; in the financial
administration of the Palestinian Authority; this is the conclusion contained
in a report prepared by the Palestinian Monitoring Board and published in
leading Palestinian dailies as of 25 May.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Board, a semi-official body that functions as a comptroller,
pointed out in its unprecedented report that an estimated $326 million (roughly
40% of the total PA budget) were &quot;dispersed, embezzled or spent in
dubious ways.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Board's head, Jarar al Kudwa, much of
the sum in question has been accounted for or has disappeared altogether.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking during a radio interview on 24 May, al Kudwa said
that about $50 million were lost to &quot;certain elements&quot; affiliated
with the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, a high-ranking official in the PA Ministry of
Finance, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said that most of
the financial irregularities, e.g. embezzlement, were perpetrated by Ministers,
Director-Generals, as well as third-degree and fourth-degree officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The same official intimated that persons holding key portfolios
in the PA administration purchased luxurious cars, built fancy villas and
were leading an obscenely-rich lifestyle thanks to money embezzled from
the public.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The unprecedented disclosures were not surprising for the
majority of Palestinians in the occupied territories.  News of widespread
corruption within various PA ministries and institutions became common knowledge
within the autonomous enclaves following the 23 March publication in the
Guardian of David Hirst's investigative report entitled &quot;Shameless
in Gaza&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, the report, however low in its profile and
euphemistic in its wording, drew sharp reactions from ordinary Palestinians.
 A cab driver from Dura, 10 miles south-west of Hebron, protested that &quot;we
didn't know that these folks (the PA) were a gang of thieves.&quot;  Another
Palestinian who makes a living selling the traditional falafel sandwiches
in downtown Hebron remarked, &quot;Now we know where the donor countries'
money goes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, the Palestinian leadership sought to distance
itself from the scandal. Chairman Yasser Arafat said in a laconic statement
that he was studying the report and promised to take measures to combat
corruption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Tayyeb Abdu Rahim, Secretary of Arafat's office,
the Chairman will keenly follow up all the findings of the report and will
see to it that &quot;problematic matters&quot; and other &quot;excesses&quot;
be rectified. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pundits here do not believe that the Palestinian Authority,
or Arafat himself, would take any serious action against rampant corruption
for the simple reason that any step as such would eventually reach the &quot;red
lines&quot; bordering Arafat, his close net of officials, advisors and,
most important of all, the profiteers. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel Using the Aids Virus as a Weapon of
Mass Destruction</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The following article was forwarded to the Palestine
Times through the Internet, courtesy of  Mr. Khaled Hussain Al-Jbaihi. 
Any responses should be directed to his e:mail address: kalbuluw@NMSU.Edu.
 It demonstrates the depths to which the Israelis will stoop to destroy
the Palestinian people.  It also confirms the deep-seated hatred that the
Israelis in general feel towards them.</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israeli occupation and confiscation of Arab property have
failed.  Israeli forces have used clubs to crush Palestinian children's
skulls, limbs and backs in an effort to quell the Palestinian uprising.
 They have used live ammunition to kill and maim Palestinian children. 
They have buried Palestinian youths alive.  The Israeli occupation authorities
have even resorted to the closure of the West Bank and Gaza as a weapon
to starve the entire Palestinian population into submission, yet the Palestinian
intifadah is flourishing and is as defiant as ever in the face of their
tormentor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestinian children face Israeli guns and tanks alone.
 Their only weapons are stones, which have little impact on the Israeli
bulldozers that demolish their homes and clear their lands for Jewish settlements.
 So-called moderate Arab regimes make promises, but no meaningful support
ever reaches the truly needy.  Gulf  rulers, who in the last few years have
spent over $80 billion on useless weapons that rust in the desert, give
Palestinian children nickels and dimes in donations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Israeli government is now experimenting with a new
type of weapon of mass destruction to deal with the unyielding Palestinian
children.  The Israelis are using the Aids virus.  The method of delivery
is not through sex, which is currently being used to spread the disease
amongst Egyptians by Israeli tourists mobilized by the Israeli intelligence
(Mossad).  The Israelis are using the needle.  The deadly virus is being
transferred by injection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The slow and painful murdering of Palestinian children
is being carried out in Israeli hospitals.  The injection of death into
their muscles is being performed by Israeli nurses and doctors.  The green
light is given by members in the Israeli government at the highest level.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestinian children are alone.  They have no direction
in which to turn for support.  No one with actual power or influence is
defending their cause.  None are raising their voices in international forums
to protest this ugly and unforgivable crime.  Only the Arab League Secretary-General
Dr. Ismat Abdul Majid has spoken out against this new crime committed against
humanity by the Zionist entity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Hillary Clinton, the so-called champion of children's
causes around the world, has not uttered one word on their behalf.  Arab
presidents, kings and emirs, including Arafat, prefer not to say anything
about this newest development.  Even the media in the region controlled
by the Arab Gulf states is silent.  Yet Palestinian kids are suffering!
Palestinian children are dying!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ironically, the news of this tragic story was leaked and
appeared in &quot;Yedeout Ahronot&quot;, a Jewish newspaper.  The Israeli
daily acknowledged that 305 AIDs cases among Palestinian children were recorded.
 The children were being treated in hospitals run by the Israeli occupation
authorities.  However, Palestinian sources believe that the unreported cases
are actually in the thousands.  The paper also said that attorneys who were
approached to represent the children in their suit against the Israeli government
declined.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The &quot;peace&quot; agreements Arafat signed with the
Israeli government specifically state that crimes committed by the Israeli
authorities against Palestinians cannot be brought to justice.  All legal
suits by Palestinians against the Israeli government were dropped.  Palestinians
have no right to turn to courts to solve their grievances against the Jewish
state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Dr. Mufid Shehab, who heads Cairo University and National
Security in the Egyptian Parliament, said that the world is confronted with
a human tragedy; the rights of victims to go to a court to obtain justice
cannot be relinquished by any authority according to international law,
the Oslo Accords or any other agreement signed on behalf of the Palestinians;
they cannot be denied their legitimate and universally recognized rights;
the Israeli authorities cannot be absolved from their legal and moral responsibilities.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Demolishing Arab Homes: An Established</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli Policy in the Occupied Territories</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Israeli &quot;Civil Administration&quot; in the West
Bank has reportedly decided to destroy as many as 500 Arab homes located
within area &quot;C&quot; which, according to the ill-fated Oslo Accords,
is to remain under exclusive Israeli control at least until the final settlement.
The Israeli occupation authorities claim the houses were built without &quot;proper
permits&quot; and  are located on land needed for bypass roads, or in the
vicinity of army camps. However, it seems amply clear that the real motivation
behind the planned  &quot;massacre of Palestinian homes&quot; is first and
foremost to curtail as much as possible natural, demographic Arab population
growth particularly in the West Bank.  If true, and all indications suggest
that it is, the Israeli government would be reverting to the notorious policy
adopted by the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who sought to
&quot;narrow Palestinian horizons so much so that they would eventually
be forced to leave their homeland for its 'rightful owners&iacute;, the
Jews.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, far from upholding the &quot;law&quot;, the established
Israeli policy of systematically destroying Palestinians' homes is actually
meant, regardless of any concocted excuses, to uproot the Palestinian, Arab
and Muslim presence in Palestine, a goal that has always been the essence
of Zionist policy toward the Palestinian people. Tactically, however, home
demolition is primarily aimed at inflicting maximum emotional distress and
pain on Arab families.  The extremely callous practice is routinely resorted
to when a member of a given Palestinian family is involved, factually or
preemptively, in resistance acts against the Zionist occupation, or when,
as previously mentioned, the house is built without a license. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Second only to death, home demolition is the worst calamity
that could befall a Palestinian family.  The experience is particularly
overwhelming because of the symbolic status that a Palestinian attaches
to his or her home.  When a Palestinian wants to express extreme condemnation
to someone in Arabic, he says &quot;Yikhrib Beitak&quot;, meaning &quot;May
your home be destroyed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly, the Israeli occupation authorities have understood
this &quot;weak point&quot; in Palestinian social psychology and spared
no effort in utilizing it to its fullest potential.  Hence, the policy of
destroying residential homes of Arab families was adopted immediately following
the end of the 1967 war.  Since then, thousands of Arab homes have been
demolished, leaving indelible scars in the hearts and minds of the innocent
victims.  In fact, the effects of such barbaric acts are incalculable, especially
for children of the affected families who are most vulnerable and least
immune to mental distress.  They are likely to suffer permanent psychological
and emotional disorders that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.
 Phobias, disorientation, depression and various forms of psychosis and
neurosis are some of the mental and emotional disorders afflicting them.
(It is not difficult to imagine what goes through a child's mind as he sees
his home uprooted and destroyed by a bulldozer driven by soldiers.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unmoved by the emotional and physical suffering inflicted
to the respective families, the Israeli army actually introduced stringent
restrictions on the rebuilding of destroyed homes.  The utter savagery and
insensitivity of this policy became even more evident as the granting of
building permits was made ever more difficult for Palestinians, particularly
for those living outside the boundaries of area &quot;A,&quot; the few towns
nominally controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, which doesn't
exceed 2.5% of the total area of the West Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with the all too real prospects of becoming homeless,
many Palestinians, especially young couples who have nowhere to live, often
venture to build a home without obtaining the precious building permit beforehand.
 However, in many cases, Israeli army bulldozers move swiftly to destroy
the newly-constructed house and with it a family's dream of living in a
home of its own.  Indeed, many people risk building without a license only
because it is extremely difficult to obtain one, owing to the Israeli policy
of preventing demographic Palestinian expansion.  Even for those who can
get a building license, it usually takes years to actually get one for the
same reason.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The manner in which home demolition is carried out is significant
in itself.  The operation often begins by declaring the town or village
where the doomed house is located a closed military zone.  Then, after soldiers
take position around the house, an officer would approach the head of the
family to inform him that he has a two-hour grace period to get all belongings
and furniture out.  Distressed and distraught, family members would then
hasten to get some of their valuables out.  Older children would comfort
younger children, as they all begin to sense an impending disaster of some
kind about to be inflicted upon them.  A crying wife would beg an apathetic
army officer to spare the home they so laboriously built, brick by brick,
and spent all their life savings on it, but to no avail because the officer
informs them that they are &quot;only carrying out orders.&quot;  And as
the deadline approaches, and all hopes of saving the home prove unrealistic,
a child, returning from school and not knowing what is going on, would make
a last dash into the home before the deadline in order to get his favorite
story book.  Then another child would make a last minute venture to get
a toy he couldn't bear to see crushed.  Then the deadline would arrive and
the commanding officer would order the family to move away.  Soon afterwards,
explosives would be attached to the house columns and when the go-ahead
is given, the explosives are detonated, the home becomes rubble, and &quot;Mission
Brutality&quot; is executed.   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ruthless savagery of the home-demolition policy underscores
the incompatibility of the Zionist occupation and justice.  It also vindicates
the fact, which has yet to have access to Westerners' minds, that &quot;Zionist
Jews are like all underdogs; when they get on the top, they become as merciless
and barbaric to their victims as their former oppressors were to them when
they were underneath.&quot;  These are not the words of an overly-irate
Palestinian indulging in &quot;corrupt analogies&quot; or of an anti-Semite,
incapable of overcoming his &quot;pathological hatred for everything Jewish&quot;.
 These are the words of Harry Truman, who historians say was instrumental
in establishing  the malignant entity called Israel in Palestine in 1948.
 Or was he anti-Semitic?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians: Land Dealers Deserve Death</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Khalid Amayreh</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron (West Bank)-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The recent
killing in the West Bank of two land dealers believed to be involved in
illicit land sales to Jewish settlers has once again brought to the fore
the sharp and bitter confrontation between Jews and Palestinians over land&oacute;the
essence of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  In one respect, the killing (as seen
by Palestinians) or murder (as branded by Israeli circles) has refocused
attention on frenzied Israeli efforts to acquire, by hook or by crook, as
much Palestinian-owned land in the West Bank as possible before a political
arrangement is reached.  The matter, needless to say, acquires added emphasis
now as the current Likud-led government is embarking on a frantic settlement-building
campaign in and around East Jerusalem as well as throughout the West Bank.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinians, truly and rightly, view the closing-in
of Jewish settlements on their villages and hamlets as a mortal threat to
their future. Hence the liquidation of Farid al Bashiti and Harbi Abu Sara
in Ramallah in mid-May.  Both men had been widely suspected of plotting
and facilitating the &quot;sale&quot; of Arab land in the central region
of the West Bank to Gush Emunim settlers in return for huge sums of money
they reportedly received as &quot;commission&quot; for acting as &quot;middlemen&quot;.
 Bashiti was bludgeoned to death near the Ramallah police station with his
hands tied and his mouth taped, while Abu Sara was shot four times in the
head.  It is not known for sure who killed the two land dealers, but a finger
of accusation is already pointed toward the Palestinian Authority.  Indeed,
Israeli police arrested two persons (a man and a woman) affiliated with
the Preventive Security on suspicion that they killed Bashiti, who held
Israeli citizenship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, the PA expressed no compunction over the
killing.  Indeed, the Palestinian Ministry of Justice had earlier decided
to reactivate an old but extant Jordanian law imposing the death penalty
on Palestinians involved in &quot;selling land to the enemy&quot;.  The
step was received with profound satisfaction throughout the occupied territories
and was particularly commended by Hamas, which reportedly volunteered to
provide the PA with detailed lists of &quot;land smugglers deserving retribution
for their treachery&icirc;.  At al Aqsa Mosque, the Mufti of Jerusalem,
Sheikh Ikrema Sabri, lashed out at &quot;traitors, motivated by greed, who
seek to kill our future in return for a sum of money.&quot;  He spelled
out a fatwa or &quot;religious ruling&quot; ascribing as apostasy to land
dealers who knowingly take part in &quot;Israeli genocidal designs against
our people&icirc;.  On 25 May, the Sheikh of Al Azhar in Egypt issued a
similar fatwa on &quot;land sales to the Jews within the Palestinian context&quot;,
saying that &quot;land dealers in this particular context are treacherous
to God, His messengers and the community of believers&quot; and therefore
&quot;deserve the death penalty.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Islamic law,  however, it is not forbidden
to sell land to &quot;the people of the book&quot; (e.g. Jews) under normal
circumstances.  However, when and if such a sale harms the collective interest
of Muslims (as in Palestine), it becomes absolutely unlawful. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The invoking of the death penalty against land dealers
prompted the Israeli-Zionist propaganda machine to launch a vitriolic campaign
against the weak and vulnerable Palestinian Authority.  Thus, comparisons
were made between the measures against land dealers and the Nazi laws against
Jews. Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu went as far as drawing a
parallel with the Holocaust.  He described the said measures as &quot;anti-Jewish
laws that remind us of events from the past that we thought had passed over.&quot;
Foreign Minister David Levy also joined ranks in attacking &quot;the rising
ugly head of Palestinian racism against Jews.&quot; Even, the avowedly racist
Gush Emunim leaders lambasted Palestinian measures as &quot;inimical to
the Jews&quot; and &quot;proving that 'they' and 'we' cannot live together.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, Israeli audacity went as far as complaining to
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights about Palestinian racism and
anti-semitism!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinians, for their part, scoffed at such remarks,
describing Israeli and American reactions as &quot;hypocritical and ludicrous&quot;,
and &quot;aimed first and foremost at blackmailing us into budging to the
Israeli arrogance of power.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;How would you like us to deal with those traitors;
you yourself killed Rudolf Kasztner when you suspected that he had collaborated
with the Nazis,&quot; protested Freih Abu Maddin, who holds the justice
portfolio in the PA, during a radio interview with the Voice of Israel on
24 May.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is totally shameless that a state that practices
institutionalized racism against its Arab citizens and enacted and continues
to enact every conceivable law solely to dispossess Palestinians of their
land has the audacity to speak about Palestinian racism against Jews,&quot;
said Yasser Arafat's spokesman Ahmed Teibi during a radio interview on 18
May.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Teibi pointed out that there are established laws in Israel
against Arab property, including the &quot;Absentee Law,&quot; which treats
Israeli Arabs as &quot;absentees&quot; and therefore enables the government
to confiscate their land. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Teibi's remarks were vindicated by Dan Yakir, an Israeli
authority on Land Law at the Association of Civil Rights in Israel, who
said in an interview with the Jerusalem Post on 25 May that &quot;there
is a policy which limits non-Jewish purchase of land.&quot; In fact, Yakir's
brief note, which utterly understates the facts, conceals a long-standing
policy of systematic discrimination against Arabs in all matters pertaining
to land.  For example, there is an absolute ban on selling Hakeren Hakayemet
(National Fund) land to non-Jews, and Arabs are prohibited to purchase land
in areas such as Galilee, where Israel is concerned about increasing the
Arab population. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians generally recognize that the imposition of
the death penalty on land dealers will produce negative public relations,
especially abroad, and particularly in the United States, where Zionist
propaganda is very strong. However, they argue that the severity of the
crime committed by greedy land dealers makes death justifiable and a just
retribution for a monstrous crime of unparalleled proportion. The issue,
Palestinians would argue, is not over the identity of the buyer but the
consequences of the sale.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The leader of the Islamic Movement in the 1948 Occupied
Palestine, Sheikh Raed Salah, appealed to the leaders and populace of the
Arab and Muslim worlds and to freedom lovers everywhere to play an active
role in defending Islamic holy sites, especially Al Aqsa Mosque in Occupied
Jerusalem which has suffered from desecration and attempts of destruction.
 &quot;An hour ago, the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu decided to open
a so-called tourist tunnel under Al Aqsa endangering its structure.  Recently
we exposed to the whole world the excavations the Israeli authorities were
making under the holy mosque.  A few days ago, the Israeli Ministry of Religions
revealed its intention to transfer Ribat al Kurd, which is part of the western
wall of Al Aqsa, to a small Wailing Wall which originally was also part
of Al Aqsa Mosque,&quot; Sheikh Salah said.</FONT></P>

suffers from several chronic diseases, including epilepsy, and may die as
his health deteriorates.  A statement by the organization pointed out that
Uwaida has not been able to see his lawyer or family for two years because
of the ban imposed by the Israeli authorities on visits to the detainees.
 &quot;Although his mother obtained permission to visit him, she could not
make the visit because the Israeli authorities would not reveal his location,&quot;

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli soldiers attack Palestinian detainees</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gaza-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> On 15 May, Israeli prison
guards used tear-gas to suppress demonstrations staged by about 300 Palestinian
detainees protesting against the lengthening of their imprisonment period,
according to a human rights group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The incident was reported in Megiddo Prison north of Tel
Aviv, where some 280 Palestinians are held without trial, said Khalida Jarrar,
executive director of Al Dameer, a Palestinian group monitoring rights of
Palestinian prisoners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Jarrar pointed out that prison guards ordered the detainees
to evacuate the prison's yard and go back to their tents in the evening,
then attacked the tents with large amounts of tear-gas.  The raid went on
for several hours leaving 90 per cent of the detainees overcome by the gas.
 She added that at least three of them had to be taken to a hospital outside
the prison.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Jarrar said that the prisoners, earlier in the morning
of that day, had held a protest against the renewing of administrative detention
for 26 detainees who had been up for release.  The prisoners refused to
cooperate during the morning count and then marched into the prison bearing
a coffin, she said.  &quot;The protest was over long before the tear-gas
started,&quot; she added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Megiddo Prison witnessed a similar riot last March after
protests were staged against administrative detention policies and poor
prison conditions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some of the detainees have been in Megiddo for over a
year without trial.  The prison also holds over 600 other Palestinians who
have been charged or tried.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Meanwhile, Palestinian sources said that Israeli occupation
soldiers attacked 17 Palestinian prisoners in the desert Nafha Prison south
of  Occupied Palestine.  They added that the detainees were beaten with
canes by about 50 soldiers of a special force of the Prison Guards. Some
detainees were badly injured, the sources said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Palestinian Human Rights Centre condemned the Israeli
atrocities against Palestinian detainees saying that the attack on Palestinian
prisoners in Nafha Prison was a violation of International conventions pertaining
to human rights protection.  The Centre also called on the guardians of
the peace agreements between the PLO and Israel to oblige the latter to
honour its commitments and release the Palestinian detainees as stipulated
in these agreements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Nafha Prison was opened by the Israeli authorities in
March 1996. About 360 prisoners were transferred to the new prison from
Majdal Prison north of Gaza.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	There are some 4,000 Palestinian detainees in Israeli
prisons who were supposed to be released last year according to the Oslo
Accords.  Israel refuses to release them although it had promised to do
so as part of the Accords.<BR>
