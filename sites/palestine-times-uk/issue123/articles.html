<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To begin with, I'd like to state in unequivocal terms that I genuinely
sympathize with Israeli &quot;civilians&quot; who are inadvertently killed by Palestinians
who in turn are desperate to let the world know of Israeli atrocities and Nazi-like
treatment of the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the personal level, the pain and tears of the families and friends of
the victims are no less genuine than the pain and tears of hundreds of Palestinian
families who have fallen victim to Ariel Sharon's bloody rampage that has been going on
for nearly a year, and God knows when it will come to an end.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Humans are humans; they react similarly when calamity strikes. A bereaved
Jewish mother's pain is no less and no more real than that of a bereaved Palestinian
mother's pain.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our dear neighbours and oppressors: I fully agree with you that the urban
bombings Palestinians are forced to carry out against you are horrible, shocking and
extremely ugly. However, it is true that they are also inevitable and inescapable, thanks
to your government's and army's equally horrible, shocking and extremely ugly actions
against our people, including children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These actions, needless to say, made the bloodshed that was and the
bloodshed to be inevitable and inescapable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let us be honest about this; the human-bomb attack that took place on King
George Street was gruesome and even barbaric in a textual sense (you can understandably
use all the nasty labels in all the lexicons to describe the tragedy), but it was also of
your own making.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When your army so impetuously, so callously and so brazenly created a
calamity (or two) in every Palestinian household, a boomerang effect was inevitable, and
only imbeciles (and you are not reputed, God forbid, for stupidity) would have calculated
that the tormented Palestinians would turn the other cheek. They wouldn't and they won't.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You, the Jews or Zionists (whatever you like to be called) have narrowed
our horizons so much that you have made us feel that only two &quot;choices&quot; are
available to us; either to die as suicide bombers or be slaughtered as sheep.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, I can dare say that blood of the &quot;personally innocent
victims&quot; of the bombing is primarily on the hands of Sharon, Benalizer, Peres and
other members of your diabolic government of assassins and war criminals.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Open your eyes! A government that sends its murderers, whether humans or
machines, to murder people without charge, without trial, without arrest, without
questioning, without anything, is not a &quot;government,&quot; but a gang, for it is the
mafia gangs that liquidate opponents through assassinations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, honestly, how, do you think, the Palestinians should have reacted to
your unabated rampage of murder and terror, especially after you used the F-16s and the
Apaches against a defenseless and essentially unarmed people?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shame on you for tormenting and terrorizing and seeking to enslave a small
nation, already decimated by 33 years of demonizing military occupation, an occupation
which all the languages of the world can't communicate its evils. Your behaviour in the
last ten months has been an affront to civilization and an insult to many of the lofty
principles that you falsely claim to be part of your value system.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your brutality, savagery, criminality, impetuousness, hypocrisy, mendacity
and insolence defy linguistic description.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You, as Harry Truman once said, are like all underdogs; when you get on
the top, you become as merciless and brutal to your new victims as your former oppressors
were to you when you were underneath.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our dear neighbours, why wasn't there any uproar in Israel when your
criminal soldiers murdered Muhammed Durra before the eyes of the world? And, now, we have
hundreds of Muhammed Durras!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You didn&#146;t even have the moral courage to say sorry. When will you
ever say &quot;sorry?&quot; Perhaps when Kosher pigs fly!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your eyes didn't blink at the daily funerals in the streets of Gaza and
the West Bank; your hearts didn't ache, nor did your minds experience any compunction,
because the poor kids belonged to the wrong tribe&#133;they were children of a lesser God.
Or, as your former Prime Minister Barak said, &quot;Their dead are mere numbers; ours are
stories.&quot; Numbers and stories! And snakes, ants, cockroaches and what have you!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our dear neighbours: you are condemned, first and foremost, for electing a
war criminal to be your Prime Minister, whose hands are drenched in the blood of the
innocent. Could it be that you elected him on that account?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You are also condemned for your gleeful support of the killing, maiming
and wounding of tens of thousands of Palestinians whose only &quot;crime&quot; is their
desire to be free from your slavery. (Is desiring freedom from slavery so great a crime in
your thinking that the desirees ought to be put to death?)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And all these homes that you destroyed and the people you made
homeless&#133;and all the trees and habitats you obliterated with your satanic bulldozers!
Don't you know that your holy book, the Torah, contains clear injunctions against
destroying trees even in time of war?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You once prided yourself, rightly or falsely, on having turned the desert
into a verdant bloom. Now, after the shame you have perpetrated, you can boast of having
turned the previously blooming Palestinian orchards, vineyards and fields into a desert.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maybe, just maybe, you will start to have some &quot;hishbon nefesh&quot;
or soul-searching; maybe you will start to view your neighbours as full human beings
created by the same God; maybe, just maybe, you will begin to respect the life and
property of the non-Jew as you do those of Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maybe, just maybe, you will start to understand that occupation is wrong,
apartheid is wrong, oppression is wrong, and, yes, Zionism is wrong.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I won't give you the benefit of the doubt. I would be an idiot if I did.
But remember this, the ball is in your court, and until you begin to view us as humans,
with equal human and legal rights, I'm absolutely sure that still much more young blood,
on our side (and yours) will still be spilled. What else can moral blindness lead to?</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Can Sharon fulfil the extreme Zionist dream?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shihadeh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One need not probe into Sharon&#146;s mind to understand his future agenda
since he represents extreme Zionism, whose publicized proclaimed objective is well known
to most people. The goal is to maintain a Jewish State in the largest Palestinian
territory he can take hold of. In other words, he needs more land but without the people,
since more non-Jewish inhabitants would compromise the Jewish character of Israel. To
achieve such aggressive and expansionist objectives, he would have to conquer the land
first and then either emulate the 1948 Nakba by evicting the non-Jewish population or be
forced into creating an apartheid that would control the Palestinian inhabitants by sheer
force. The Arab demographic ticking bomb has prompted many Israeli leaders to hold
seminars in Haifa and many other Israeli cities to discuss ways and means of diffusing the
greatest threat to Jewish exclusivity where the idea of transfer has become again a
serious goal of Zionist planners. In the last 53 years the &#147;Israeli&#148; Arabs have
increased almost eight-fold, from 150,000 to 1.2 million. If these figures were
extrapolated to include the &#147;new&#148; Israeli-controlled West Bank Arabs into the
formula, then Arab majority would take over the Jewish State in less than 20 years! In
other words, Jewish control of their own government would be seriously threatened,
assuming of course that Jewish &#147;democracy&#148; would remain the political system of
government. Therefore, to counteract such a &#147;nightmare&#148;, Israeli leaders would
have to take one of two steps: either transfer the Palestinians out or create an apartheid
that would keep control of the State in the hands of Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In discussing the idea of transfer, the propagandists of Zionism realized
that such a path would not succeed in the light of &#147;stubborn&#148; Palestinian
resistance, which would deprive Israel from ever dreaming to live in peace with the Arabs
forever while facing all kinds of world pressure that would make its implementation an
impossible dream in and of itself. This leaves Israel with the only choice left:
apartheid, which represents the lesser of two evils. However, this choice is not a
relished state of affairs either given that most of the countries in the world reacted by
forming a boycott when it existed in South Africa. In addition, Israel&#146;s claim to
&#147;democracy&#148; would be questioned, aside from the expected and determined
Palestinian resistance that would cost Israel a continuous flow of victims. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of the above, I am completely baffled by Israeli planners who are
usually rated very high by the international intelligent circles. My only conclusion is
that extreme Zionism has become so intoxicated with power that it has become blind to the
inevitable future developments. Even without firing a shot in the direction of Israel, the
expected demographic changes cannot favour the future of Israel, as time (for the first
time) is not on the side of Israel. If I were an Israeli leader who is very loyal to
Zionist dreams, I would rush into an agreement with the Palestinians to establish the
two-State solution that would secure a Jewish State as one of them before the demographic
bomb explodes in the face of Zionism and removes it from the world scene. I would have
espoused Oslo principles as a golden opportunity that would secure Israel&#146;s future
before it&#146;s too late. Sharon&#146;s promise to bring peace and security to the
Israeli electorate has failed drastically, as many of us have predicted. Miracles do not
happen anymore and the Palestinians are not simply going to vanish into oblivion to
accommodate Sharon&#146;s dreams.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the Arab leaders&#146; apathy to the Intifada notwithstanding, we
still have to continue the struggle and develop the Intifada to a more mature level that
would turn Zionist dreams into a nightmare. For those who claim that such resistance is
too costly, they have to remember that the road to freedom is not lined with roses. Cuba,
South Africa, Vietnam and the million martyrs Algerian revolution should remind us that
our national aspirations could not be achieved without human sacrifices, especially with
such an atrocious enemy. To acquiesce to Israeli unfair and humiliating dictates is to
accept total surrender and submission to an oppressor whose goal is to keep us under his
heels forever.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Edna Yaghi</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am the product of your tyranny. You have dissected the leftovers of my
country into bits and pieces of shantytowns, ghettoes and concentrations camps. You have
cut off my water supply and left me thirsty while you, the Israelis, bathe in cooled pools
not far from where I live. You have uprooted my trees and desecrated my fields making sure
I have no way to sustain myself or those who depend on me. You have cut off medical
supplies that treat the wounded, and at your checkpoints, you detain and humiliate
Palestinians and prevent those who are in dire need of medical assistance to pass through
causing my people, who are your victims, to die at your impromptu borders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You assassinate my freedom fighters while explaining to the world that you
are merely defending your own squatters. You shoot to kill little children who in defiance
and courage wield small stones in the name of liberty against you, the fiercely armed
enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You torture the children and resistance fighters; you incarcerate and try
to bribe or coerce my people into collaborating against one another. You bulldoze homes
and you prevent me from earning a living. You kill me by remote control from your
U.S.-made Apache helicopters, and your settlers who squat on what you have left me of my
land throw firebombs into my dwellings and on my passageways, attack my children and
womenfolk with guns and clubs and hate.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You occupy my land and on my bloodstained hills station your tanks and
armoured jeeps in order to shoot off one by one little children playing in the streets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You take over the Orient House, my one symbol of freedom that was donated
by a man worth all Israelis put together, while at the same time you starve the orphans
just across the street.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You shoot out my water tanks and you kill off Palestinian servicemen even
though at the time of your brutal massacres, these servicemen were patrolling their land
or simply eating their last supper. You cut off my electricity so you can assassinate me
more easily in the dank shadows of your dark treachery.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You are cowards and you are afraid of little Palestinian children with
stones. You never kill them single handedly. You roam in groups like packs of wild dogs
and you are just as vicious if not more so.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You leave me and my people without hope and when you have driven me into a
corner and deprived me of all that is human, I react with anger and bitterness. I strap
explosives onto my body and search for a place to detonate myself. Yes, I kill your
civilians, but this is the price you have to pay for taking away my inalienable rights,
the rights that all men are entitled to, for your demoniacal oppression of my people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is really very simple. God created all men equal and no man better than
any other. Yet, somehow you have made it your protocol that Jews are better than all
others and that you have the right to come to my land committing rape and plunder yet
expect me to thank you for doing so. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just the other day, a young boy was eating lunch. One of your settlers who
came from America threw a firebomb into this boy&#146;s house. His two brothers were
killed immediately. But the one boy survived albeit horribly disfigured. His name is Amar
Emeera. His scars have turned a once beautiful child into a grotesque being that does not
even look human. What did this child do to go through life so horribly disfigured?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You shoot babies point blank while swaddled in their parent&#146;s arms in
Palestinian cars going to weddings. You slay Palestinian children going to and from school
and you slaughter Palestinian children when they fight your armies with their bare hands.
One such child, Mohammed Abu Arrar was shot down and killed when he protested your
occupation of his land. Palestinian relatives of the boy kissed his body laid out in his
coffin before he was taken away to be buried in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You kill unarmed Palestinian fathers on their way to buy school supplies
and books for their children. You have even run out of excuses for the atrocities you
continue to perpetrate. You shell the homes of Palestinian families, instantly killing the
occupants and then claim that the action was friendly fire from the Palestinians even
though the homes were far removed from the scene of the battle and even though remnants of
your American-made shells are scattered about the demolished homes of the innocent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You collectively punish 3 million Palestinians, half of whom are children
who reside on what is left of their own land though you know full well that their only
desire is to free themselves from your barbaric cruelty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You tell the world that you want peace yet at every corner, at every
instance, you are as far from peace as the earth is from a different universe speeding in
an opposite direction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You speak peace with the forked tongues of your warmongers and then
pretend shock when finally a Palestinian human bomb blows himself up.</p>

<p>You will only be free of the threat of human bombs when you seek a just and
comprehensive peace and when you end your occupation of the indigenous inhabitants of
Palestine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Delusional Politics</font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><em>Dr. Hanan Ashrawi*</em></b></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The worst type of mental delusion is described as the inability to grasp,
  cope with, or comprehend concrete reality&#151;hence the construction of a non-existent,
  mythical, or totally fictitious reality that exists only in the delusional mind. <br>
  <br>
  An objective observer of the drastic deterioration in conditions and the lethal breakdown
  governing Palestinian-Israeli realities may safely draw the conclusion that the definition
  of this type of &#147;insanity&#148; applies. <br>
  <br>
  Among its discernable symptoms and manifestations are the very concrete and willful
  insistence on dealing with a fictitious &#147;reality&#148; that seems to bear no
  relationship to the world or to the components of the escalating crisis. <br>
  <br>
  First&#151;there seems to be an insistence in the minds of Israeli decision makers that
  the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands does not actually exist, but is a figment of
  the twisted imagination of some Palestinians who insist that their collective
  victimization is a direct result of their enslavement by the Israeli occupation. <br>
  <br>
  These same Israeli officials also are at odds with the &#147;misguided&#148; or
  &#147;biased&#148; positions of the international community, international law, and UN
  resolutions that somehow &#147;perversely&#148; keep insisting on the usage of such
  terminology as &#147;belligerent occupant&#148; in describing Israel&#146;s role in the
  Palestinian territories. <br>
  <br>
  Hence the Israeli coinage of alternative &#147;unreal&#148; terms such as
  &#147;disputed&#148; rather than &#147;occupied&#148; territories. &#147;Homeland for the
  Jews&#148; or &#147;greater Israel&#148; has also been employed as verbal substitutes for
  historical Palestine, despite the fact that Palestinians have accepted the term
  &#147;Israel&#148; as applicable to the state that now exists on 78% of historical
  Palestine. <br>
  <br>
  Second&#151;the whole concept of &#147;defense&#148; has been turned on its head to apply
  only to the Israeli occupation whereby Israel is engaged in &#147;self defense&#148; when
  it shells Palestinian homes and turns them into piles of rubble. The &#147;reason,&#148;
  of course is that Palestinians were firing from these homes (often despite the absence of
  any evidence), thereby transforming them into impersonal and banal &#147;structures&#148;
  that had to be &#147;removed&#148; for the proper &#147;defense&#148; of the Israeli
  &#147;Defense&#148; Forces. <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, civilians who are torn to bits by shells fired from Apache gun ships or Israeli
  tanks are not &#147;assassinated&#148; according to the Israeli lexicon. They are
  &#147;eliminated&#148; as part of Israel&#146;s &#147;active self-defense&#148; policy.
  Any reference to &#147;extra-judicial killings&#148; or &#147;cold-blooded murder&#148;
  must be expurgated from the pc (politically corrupt) dictionary of &#147;Israelese.&#148; <br>
  <br>
  When Israel besieges the Palestinian territories and turns each village, camp, or town
  into an isolation prison, the territories are &#147;closed&#148; in defense of the
  Israelis who are &#147;besieged&#148; by the Palestinians (and, at times, Arabs) in their
  &#147;beleaguered&#148; state. The fact that the Israeli army is the strongest in the
  region, and that it has total control over the lives and lands of the Palestinians, seems
  to have vanished from official Israeli consciousness and discourse. <br>
  <br>
  Third&#151;a new concept of &#147;humanity&#148; seems to have evolved in the imagination
  of Israeli political and religious ideologues. The term, of course, does not seem to apply
  to Palestinians at all&#151;having been described variously as &#147;vipers, cockroaches,
  crocodiles, an evil curse, etc.&#148; The most appropriate Israeli term for any
  Palestinian human being is, of course, &#147;terrorist.&#148; Such a convenient label, in
  one fell sweep, serves to deprive the Palestinian of his/her humanity as some form of a
  genetically-violent species, thereby unfit for human treatment or rights, hence fully
  deserving of any form of brutality exercised against him/her in the course of
  Israel&#146;s struggle for &#147;self-defense.&#148; &#147;Terrorism,&#148; of course is
  never applicable to any Israeli individual or policy regardless of the massive targeting
  of a captive civilian Palestinian population that has been deprived of all forms of
  security or rights. <br>
  <br>
  While the delusional mind has proven to be very fertile ground for a whole variety of
  &#147;dehumanization&#148; exercises in relation to the Palestinian human species, the
  most striking and warped depiction has been firmly rooted in the biological area. It seems
  that Palestinian mothers and fathers are born missing the parenting gene, hence they
  deliberately and cold-bloodedly send out their children to &#147;intercept&#148; the free
  passage of Israeli bullets and shells. Not only do they find a convenient way of getting
  rid of their children by such devious means, even more insidiously Palestinian parents
  also succeed in giving the Israeli army a bad name such as &#147;child killers&#148;
  thereby scoring free media points. <br>
  <br>
  In the same vein, Palestinians cynically transform their children into &#147;human
  shields&#148; in some weird form of metamorphosis whereby infants killed in their
  mothers&#146; arms or children shot on their way to/from school, or playing in their back
  yards, or indulging in such abnormal/delinquent behavior as playing soccer or shopping, or
  daring to take naps in their own beds&#151;are all part of an adult conspiracy to utilize
  (through procreation) a unique form of protective gear for their own survival. <br>
  <br>
  Thus, the 165 Palestinian children who were murdered by Israeli troops and settlers since
  October 2000 were actually non-human forms of &#147;shields&#148; and &#147;media
  ploys&#148; invented by the Palestinians for the sole purpose of giving the Israeli
  delusional mind a bad name. <br>
  <br>
  Fourth&#151;conceptual distortions also generate self-defeating strategies, particularly
  when applied to the Israeli concept of &#147;Security.&#148; The term, somehow, has become
  the exclusive domain of Israel with no reference or applicability to the Palestinians or
  to the Arab world. The Palestinians, therefore, have no right to feel &#147;insecure&#148;
  when their homes are being shelled or their children killed or their crops and trees
  uprooted or their lands &#147;confiscated&#148; or their livelihoods destroyed or their
  freedoms negated or their very lives &#147;targeted.&#148; <br>
  <br>
  Somehow, such a distorted view of reality gives itself license to conceive of a
  &#147;safe,&#148; or &#147;secure,&#148; or &#147;normal,&#148; or even a
  &#147;pleasant&#148; occupation. The most elementary conclusion that the occupation itself
  is the most pervasive form of cruelty and provocation seems to escape the grasp of such a
  world- view. Thus, Israeli discourse is always characterized by perpetual
  &#147;surprise&#148; at the lack of docility of the Palestinians who have failed
  historically to appreciate the virtues of a &#147;benevolent&#148; or &#147;benign&#148;
  occupation. By a strange twist of logic, it demands guarantees for the
  &#147;security&#148; of the occupier from any retaliation or resistance by the occupied,
  while enjoying full immunity and impunity. <br>
  <br>
  The fact that the occupation itself lies at the root of all &#147;insecurity&#148; has not
  crossed the minds of Israeli policy makers who persist in their futile search for causes
  among their victims instead of looking within. <br>
  <br>
  Fifth&#151;in addition, the Israeli fictional world of politics has spun numerous myths
  and imaginary versions to deal with the &#147;reality&#148; of negotiations. The most
  prevalent version is that of the &#147;generous offer&#148; that the previous Israeli
  prime minister Barak had offered the Palestinians out of the generosity of his
  soul&#151;probably having been inspired by the pastoral American Camp David setting and
  the irresistible charm of the then American president Bill Clinton. Unfortunately, the
  Palestinians proceeded to behave like &#147;ungrateful natives,&#148; biting the hand that
  feeds them, with no appreciation of the white man&#146;s burden of Barak (and even Peres)
  who had been trying to teach them the rudimentary elements of statehood. <br>
  <br>
  By refusing to fragment the West Bank and accommodate settlement clusters, by insisting on
  &#147;territorial contiguity&#148; (the DOP, or Oslo Agreement) instead of fragmented
  native reservations, by maintaining their commitment to international law and UN
  resolutions, by refusing to relinquish the Palestinian refugees&#146; right of return, and
  by not handing occupied Jerusalem over to the Israelis on a silver platter, the
  Palestinians proved to be &#147;unrealistic and inflexible.&#148; After all, Barak knew
  not only what was best for Israel, but also what was good for the Palestinians. <br>
  <br>
  The &#147;unprecedented Israeli concessions&#148; that sought to maintain Israeli control
  while annexing Palestinian land and resources and devaluing Palestinian rights were
  somehow &#147;inexplicably&#148; rejected by Arafat (the archetypal villain) who all along
  had harbored evil designs for the &#147;destruction of the state of Israel&#148; and had
  never mended his &#147;terrorist&#148; ways. With one imaginative sweep, the Israeli mind
  transformed Arafat from a &#147;peace partner&#148; to &#147;the terrorist enemy&#148;
  without so much as a by your leave. <br>
  <br>
  Such a miraculous transformation, by necessity, had to be accompanied by a deliberate
  &#147;demonization&#148; if the illogic is to be maintained. Thus Arafat became the
  convenient &#147;scapegoat&#148; to be burdened with all the failures of Israeli policy
  and with the sins and extreme provocation of a brutal occupation for the sake of a
  convenient Israeli catharsis. The &#147;disappointment&#148; of the fair-weather Israeli
  &#147;peace camp&#148; could then be justified with an easy conscience. The
  &#147;betrayal&#148; then would not be theirs&#151;as having betrayed the principles and
  integrity of a just peace&#151;but would be the &#147;failure&#148; of the Palestinians to
  abide by the rules and roles designed for them by the all-knowing, superior Israeli mind. <br>
  <br>
  The debate then shifted as to whether Arafat was a &#147;suitable&#148; Palestinian leader
  or not&#151;i.e. whether he met the Israeli definitions of proper Palestinian leadership
  or whether he failed the &#147;test of legitimacy&#148; Israeli-style. <br>
  <br>
  Hence the sixth delusional symptom that finds its expression in Israel&#146;s god-given
  right to shape not only Palestinian territoriality, but also the requirements of
  leadership legitimacy and suitability. <br>
  <br>
  The &#147;seal of approval&#148; syndrome is a typical expression of power intoxication,
  particularly applicable to situations of colonization. <br>
  <br>
  By extension, it applies to a whole people as well. Its most frequent manifestation is in
  such formulations as the &#147;push button&#148; people and the &#147;control&#148;
  controversy. <br>
  <br>
  The schizophrenic aspect of the delusional mind can accommodate several contradictory and
  equally false versions of reality, including: <br>
  <br>
  1. 1. Arafat is &#147;in control,&#148; hence he &#147;issued orders&#148; to his
  &#147;push button&#148; people who immediately &#147;complied&#148; by resorting to
  &#147;violence and terrorism&#148; that were the Arafat &#147;hidden agenda&#148; all
  along. He must be removed. <br>
  2. 2. Arafat is not &#147;in control,&#148; hence he cannot &#147;order&#148; his people
  to &#147;stop the violence&#148; thereby making it imperative for Israel to create
  &#147;alternative leadership&#148; that is more &#147;flexible and reasonable,&#148;
  capable of being compliant and of carrying out Israel&#146;s bidding as a test of
  &#147;pragmatism.&#148; He must be removed. <br>
  3. 3. Arafat is in &#147;partial control,&#148; hence he must be &#147;strengthened&#148;
  against his more &#147;radical&#148; opponents who reject any peace with Israel. He must
  be brought to sign. <br>
  4. 4. Arafat is in &#147;partial control,&#148; hence he must be &#147;weakened&#148;
  enough to feel sufficiently threatened in his &#147;authority&#148; to accept the Israeli
  version of reality as his lifeline. He must be made to sign. <br>
  <br>
  The variations and permutations are endless. <br>
  <br>
  Seventh&#151;national liberation movements can be &#147;crushed&#148; and
  &#147;subdued&#148; if sufficient force is used. Concomitant with this delusion is the
  myth that the escalation of Israeli violence and brutality will not only &#147;teach the
  Palestinians a lesson,&#148; but will also bring them to their knees in search of respite
  and Israeli approval. The perception of the Palestinians as &#147;inhabitants of the
  territories&#148; rather than a nation with inalienable rights, particularly in the
  exercise of their nationhood, lies behind Israeli military efforts at subduing the
  &#147;restless natives.&#148; <br>
  <br>
  Thus the lessons of history are never part of the delusional mindset. The fact that no
  colonized people had ever been brought to their knees or forced to abandon their quest for
  freedom, dignity, and independence as a result of increased violence and oppression skips
  notice altogether. More specifically, throughout decades of occupation, Israel had
  persistently attempted&#151;and failed&#151;to subdue the Palestinian people by brute
  force, succeeding only in generating more volatility and aggravating existing conditions
  of instability and conflict. The will to resist subjugation and the yearning for freedom
  and dignity have never been broken or defeated. Such a willful &#147;blindness to history
  and experience&#148; is also indicative of a serious rift between reality and awareness
  producing dysfunctional and dangerous policies. <br>
  <br>
  Eighth&#151;many of these policies can be traced back to another disconnection from
  reality. According to the Sharon lexicon, the situation is one of &#147;war&#148; rather
  than occupation, hence all Palestinians are potential &#147;combatants&#148;&#151;i.e.
  legitimate targets for his policy of &#147;targeted killings&#148;&#151;hence the
  objective is to achieve a state of &#147;non-belligerency&#148; rather than achieving
  peace by withdrawing from the occupied territories and recognizing Palestinian rights. In
  plain language, the Palestinians must not express any hostility towards their occupiers
  and must reconcile themselves to a perpetual state of enslavement by coercion. <br>
  <br>
  Thus the term &#147;ceasefire&#148; was forcibly imposed on the discourse of Israel, the
  US, and the international community as a whole. The victim must not be allowed to fight
  back, however feebly, while the conqueror will not stop shelling and shooting until the
  &#147;target&#148; surrenders or is destroyed. <br>
  <br>
  The oft-repeated dictum that &#147;Israel will not negotiate under fire&#148; applies only
  to Palestinian &#147;fire&#148; or attempts at self-defense. While Israel must be left
  unhampered in its fire-shell-assassinate at will policy, the Palestinians must maintain
  &#147;zero violence&#148; leading to a &#147;cooling off period&#148; that would prepare
  the way for &#147;confidence-building measures&#148; and ultimately award the Palestinians
  the coveted &#147;prize&#148; of resuming negotiations with their occupiers. <br>
  <br>
  Rarely, if ever, has the world witnessed such an aberration whereby the victim is placed
  &#147;on probation&#148; and asked to demonstrate &#147;good behavior&#148; in order to be
  granted the &#147;privilege&#148; of negotiating with the oppressor. The racist,
  patronizing attitude of the Sharon government constitutes yet another set of blinders that
  distort its perceptions of reality. <br>
  <br>
  Ninth&#151;once delusional concepts take over, both discourse and policy enter the realm
  of the absurd. The issue of Jerusalem is one of the most glaring examples of such an
  incongruous condition. On the one hand, Israel claims to have &#147;liberated&#148;
  (rather than occupied) Jerusalem in 1967 and to have guaranteed full &#147;access&#148; to
  the city while assuring members of all three monotheistic faiths their &#147;freedom and
  right to worship.&#148; <br>
  <br>
  In reality, Jerusalem under occupation is a city under siege, totally closed off to all
  Palestinians&#151;both Christian and Muslim&#151;who do not carry the blue ID&#146;s
  issued by Israel to Palestinian Jerusalemites. At times, even those are classified by
  gender and age where men (only) who are forty or older are allowed into the Aqsa Mosque.
  West Bank and Gaza Palestinians can no more attend services in the churches and mosques of
  Jerusalem than they can fly to the moon. They are banned from their capital, and are
  forbidden to conduct any kind of personal, social, economic, cultural, educational or any
  other type of human activity there. &#147;Religious tolerance&#148; and all manifestations
  of &#147;freedom&#148; have gained a surrealistic significance in their application by
  Israel. <br>
  <br>
  Tenth&#151;while such a warped mentality may find endless expressions, the most
  &#147;creative&#148; forms are those that are used to distinguish between Palestinians and
  Israelis. Among those is the depiction of every Palestinian victim of Israel&#146;s state
  terrorism as a &#147;ticking bomb,&#148; thereby rendering his/her assassination as a
  dispassionate and impersonal exercise tantamount to the &#147;dismantling&#148; of an
  explosive device. The 48 &#147;dismantled&#148; Palestinians so far (along with the
  &#147;unfortunate bystanders&#148;) are part of Israel&#146;s policy of
  &#147;interception&#148; and &#147;self-defense&#148; that has gained approval even from
  such high western officials as the American vice-president himself (who found it
  &#147;justifiable&#148; or &#147;reasonable&#148;). <br>
  <br>
  Israel&#146;s publication of seven names on its hit list of Palestinians slated for
  &#147;elimination,&#148; has compounded the confusion. The &#147;targets&#148; all have
  first, father&#146;s, grandfather&#146;s, family, and even clan names indicating a
  genealogy and a distinctly biological/human continuity. <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, all Israelis are &#147;civilians,&#148; including vigilante settlers
  who are armed to the teeth and who regularly terrorize whole Palestinian communities,
  often with Israeli army cover and protection. Settlements are, of course, harmless and
  defenseless &#147;Jewish neighborhoods&#148; that deserve &#147;protection&#148; and
  require more Palestinian land for &#147;natural growth.&#148; Ancient Palestinian villages
  and towns not only do not require room for &#147;natural growth&#148; on their own land,
  the strangling siege does not give them room to breathe since they are inhabited by
  potential &#147;terrorists&#148; and non-human &#147;objects&#148; that occupy
  &#147;structures&#148; that can be &#147;surgically&#148; removed by an equally impersonal
  missile fired from an American Apache gun ship. Their crops and trees are, by that logic,
  entirely superfluous and Israel is entirely within its rights to destroy them. <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, one could argue that by losing touch with reality on such a grand scale, and
  like all criminals found mentally unfit to bear the consequences of their own actions, the
  Israeli government should not be held accountable. <br>
  <br>
  The more sinister aspect of such &#147;mental incompetence&#148; is the conscious
  inducement of this state, deliberately invoked as an instrument for the manipulation of
  the perceptions of others. Such a unique form of &#147;insanity&#148; will ultimately be
  exposed and dealt with in a manner appropriate to the malady. <br>
  <br>
  Such is the message that Sharon must hear from the Belgian courts for his persistent war
  crimes, that Carmi Gillon must hear from the Danish courts for his systematic policy of
  torture, and that General Mofaz and all his cohorts who have devised a demonically
  hysterical solution to the Palestinian intifada and to Palestinian human reality as a
  whole must hear from the rest of the world. Otherwise known as &#147;military mania,&#148;
  when delusions of unbridled power and control are transformed into actual policy, the need
  for protection becomes paramount. <br>
  <br>
  If this is Israel&#146;s policy of &#147;restraint,&#148; as Sharon boasts publicly and
  often, then many policy makers in Israel need to be &#147;restrained.&#148; In this
  context, &#147;International protection&#148; gains a new meaning and an added urgency. <br>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Is the PA collapsing?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After nearly a year of unrelenting Israeli attacks on Palestinian
population centres, and with no prospects of an end to the Aqsa Intifada, the Palestinian
Authority is showing increasing signs of disintegration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA, many Palestinians are noticing, is not only miserably failing to
defend and protect them from the brutal and often deadly attacks by the Israeli army and
Jewish terrorists, but is also showing a shocking lack of leadership at virtually all
levels.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This absence of leadership is pushing ordinary Palestinians to look to the
resistance groups, such as Fatah and Hamas, for protection and leadership, especially at
the local level where the signs and symbols of the Palestinian authority all but vanished.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, nobody among the Palestinians ever expected the PA, with its
small and utterly ineffective police force, to stand up to the mighty Israeli army, with
all its state-of-the-art arsenal of F-16s and Apache helicopter gun-ships. Such a thing is
obviously beyond the PA ability.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the fact that the PA failed all along to make its presence felt,
at least symbolically, created a growing sense of alienation and estrangement toward it
among the people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the most conspicuous failures of the PA happen to be in the
law-enforcement sphere. In this field, there has been an almost total paralysis as most of
the courts throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip are not operating, mainly due to
draconian Israeli restrictions on the movement of Palestinians outside their immediate
places of residence, as most Palestinian population centres remain effectively under
Israeli siege and are cut off from one another.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The absence or gradual diminishing of law enforcement found a stark
expression last month in the bloody dispute between two clans in the southern Gaza Strip.
There, members of the two feuding families fought street gun-battles for several hours,
using automatic rifles and heavy machine-guns. The PA police did intervene eventually, but
not before seven people, including a PA intelligence officer, had been killed and ten
others injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, a bloodbath was averted when the bodyguards of Mousa Arafat,
the widely-despised chief of the PA military intelligence in Gaza, exchanged fire with
scores of popular militiamen (which included resistance fighters from various groups
including Hamas and Fatah). The militiamen surrounded Mousa Arafat's home in downtown
Gaza, calling him a &quot;traitor&quot; and a &quot;thief&quot; for ordering his men a few
days earlier to shoot at a group of Hamas fighters who had just fired a few mortar shells
on a Jewish settlement near Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The incident was perceived as a direct challenge to Yasser Arafat's
leadership, prompting the PA to organize a pro-Arafat demonstration in Gaza a few days
later. However, the demonstration was modest by Palestinian standards, and most people
viewed it as a hapless and impotent show of force.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In early August, a similar, though smaller, incident took place in Nablus,
when three people were killed, including one PA official. And as usual, the PA did very
little beyond issuing statements condemning the incidents and repeating the ritual
assertion that it intended to enforce &quot;law and order.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, such incidents are likely to continue, thanks to the
virtual absence of &quot;law and order&quot; and of the PA&#146;s inability to exercise
authority owing to the Israeli occupation and the chronic internal factors permeating the
PA structure.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Disenchantment with the PA growing</b></u><br>
But such incidents, despite their grave nature, are not the main source of Palestinians'
present disenchantment with the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloody Israeli rampage, particularly the almost daily assassination of
Palestinian activists and accompanying collateral killing of civilians, including
children, is really forcing people to cry out, &quot;Where is the PA?&quot; and &quot;What
are the 15 security agencies doing?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Much of the bitterness is directed at Yasser Arafat himself, who most
Palestinians complain is spending far more time in the air flying between Europe and the
Middle East than on the ground in Ramallah or Gaza, helping repulse Israeli aggression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the past, Arafat's extensive travels generated more amusement and
satiric comments than indignation among Palestinians. However, now with Israeli
air-to-ground missiles and artillery shells raining on Palestinian towns round-the-clock,
the most peripatetic person in the world is coming under growing scrutiny and even severe
criticism from all directions for &quot;fleeing the problems at home by flying away.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 31 July, after the Israeli aerial bombardment of the Hamas information
office in downtown Nablus in which 8 civilians, including two Hamas political leaders,
were killed, Palestinian Legislative Council member Husam Khader asked angrily, &quot;What
is he (Arafat) doing? The Israelis are slaughtering us like sheep, and he is flying from
one capital to the other like Alice in Wonderland.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khader, who was speaking on the popular Qatari satellite television
station, al-Jazeera, went on castigating the PA as &quot;a bunch of thieves protected
by70,000 policemen.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The criticism was too harsh for PA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo
who reportedly asked al-Jazeera officials to refrain from re-airing Khader's remarks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Abed Rabbo instructed the PA radio station programme, the Voice
of Palestine, to launch a scathing attack against Khader, accusing him of &quot;serving
Israeli interests.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another central aspect of the growing indignation at the PA is its refusal
(and inability) to crack down on &quot;the collaborators&quot;&#151;Palestinians recruited
by the Israeli domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, to act as informers, saboteurs
and quislings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is ample evidence that the vast bulk of Israeli assassinations of
Palestinian activists over the course of the past 10 months would not have succeeded had
it not been for the &quot;collaborators&quot; who, using cellular phones, informed their
Israeli bosses of the smallest details on the movement of the individuals targeted for
assassination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some collaborators, who were arrested, made stunning confessions
illustrating the extent to which the Israeli intelligence penetrated the Palestinian
society, employing a variety of sinister and immoral tactics and taking advantage of the
economic degradation in the occupied territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian public has, of course, welcomed the arrest and prosecution
of a number of collaborators whose collaboration with the enemy led to the assassination
by the Israeli army of several top-level political activists from Fatah, Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, many Palestinians are complaining that the number of
collaborators tried so far is too little and coming too late, and are demanding that the
collaborators, many of whom are well known, be arrested before the act not after it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obviously, the PA can't appear to be led by the rabbles in this regard and
wouldn't approve of &quot;street justice,&quot; as this would tarnish its image on the
international arena and enable Israel to score more points in the vital public relations
battle that is being fought on TV screens and the internet around the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the continuing assassinations are placing more pressure on the PA
to act &quot;tougher than usual&quot; toward the collaborators, and to tacitly tolerate
the &quot;liquidation&quot; of some collaborators, as happened during recent weeks.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lack of support frustrates and angers Palestinians</b></u><br>
Meanwhile, Palestinian frustration and anger at the feebleness of Arab official and
popular reactions to the current Palestinian plight are becoming more focal than ever
before.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 3 August, Friday speakers throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
lashed out at Arab regimes (and people) for failing to provide tangible support for the
Palestinians in the face of continuing Israeli atrocities and terror.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Muhammed Hussein, one of the highest-ranking Muslim clerics at the
Aqsa Mosque, pointed out that Palestinians were feeling deeply betrayed by the Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Describing Arab and Islamic reactions as &quot;disgraceful,&quot; Hussein
complained bitterly that the Arab world is reaping &quot;50 years of police-State
repression and terror.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We have not seen even one big demonstration in solidarity with the
Palestinian people in any Arab capital. And when such a demonstration takes place, the
repressive regimes send their police to beat up and shoot at demonstrators.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron, the imam of the Grand Mosque in Dura, sheikh Nayef Rajoub, used
tougher words.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Arab leaders and peoples are content with watching our children
being slaughtered by the Nazi Jews. Is this what they want? I'm sorry to say that the
blood of our children is on the hands of Mubarak, Fahd and Abdullah as much as it is on
the blood of the criminal gang of assassins and murderers in Israel.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajoub, who was speaking before an estimated 5,000 believers, questioned
the logic of purchasing billions of dollars&#146; worth of modern arms from the West when
the Palestinians are forced to use their own shoes to repulse Jewish attacks on
al-Masjidul Aqsa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I hereby suggest to the esteemed Arab kings and Presidents-for-life
that they substitute arms deals with shoe deals so that the Palestinians can have more
shoes to defend Islam's third holiest shrine.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajoub was apparently referring to an incident at the Aqsa Mosque in
recent days when Palestinians threw shoes at Israeli policemen who stormed the Aqsa Mosque
esplanade to suppress Muslims protesting attempts by a Jewish messianic group to lay the
cornerstone for a Jewish temple near the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) of Jerusalem. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Why the whitewashing of Zionism<br>
will remain a dirty business</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Leopards never change the spots on their skins. It is the nature of
things. To attempt otherwise would be an exercise in futility. This is exactly what the
United Nations set out to achieve in December 1991 when it revoked resolution 3379, which
determined that Zionism is a form of racism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The UN decision to declare Zionism a form of racism on 10 November 1975
was not the result of an anti-Semitic campaign. It was the verdict of the majority of
members of the world body united and resolute in their determination to eliminate all
forms of racial discrimination. They affirmed that doctrines of racial differentiation or
superiority are scientifically wrong, morally condemnable, socially unjust and politically
dangerous. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shortly before the historic resolution was adopted, the Assembly of Heads
of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity convened their twelfth
ordinary session in Kampala (between 28 July and 1 August 1975) and declared, &#147;that
the racist regime in occupied Palestine and the racist regimes in Zimbabwe and South
Africa have a common imperialist origin, forming a whole and having the same racist
structure and being organically linked in their policy aimed at repression of the dignity
and integrity of the human being.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Contrary to the practice of recording the reasons for its declarations,
the UN was curiously short of words when it revoked the resolution in December 1991. With
virtually no preamble to cushion its considerable impact, resolution 46/86 blandly read
that the General Assembly &#147;Decides to revoke the determination contained in its
resolution 3379 (XXX) of 10 November 1975.&#148; Analysts were left thereafter to surmise
the reasons for this unexplained <i>volte face</i>. In the event, it seemed that the
United States of America, at the behest of Israel, imposed it upon the UN after its
military victory in the Second Gulf War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Under
the new world order, it was irrelevant whether Palestinian national rights were restored
or not. This was the Age of <i>Pax Americana, </i>when the language of missiles would
reign supreme and might, however brutal and inhumane, determined what was right and

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The theory of Zionist racism</u><br>
</b>Those who imagined that the problem of Zionism would vanish by the stroke of a pen
were grossly mistaken. Since 1991 it remained exactly as it was at the time of its
emergence in the late nineteenth century, a &#145;mischievous political creed&#146;,
according to Edwin Montague, the former Secretary of State for India and a Jewish member
of the British Cabinet. Its objective as affirmed in Theodor Herzl&#146;s Der Judenstaat
(The State for Jews) was not only the founding of a national home for Jews in Palestine
but also the expulsion of its indigenous people. Herzl articulated the racist supremacist
views that was typical of European colonialists when he wrote that the proposed State
would become &#145;a portion of the rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of
civilization opposed to barbarism (p. 96).&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since there is no human law to justify their eviction of the Palestinians
and claim to superiority, the Zionists resorted to a higher authority. Like the
Afrikaneers in South Africa, they claimed to be the bearers of the &#145;white man&#146;s
burden&#146; to civilize the darker races based on Biblical sanction. Their posturing as
the &#147;Chosen People&#148; confused many in the West who failed to distinguish where
the revealed faith of Judaism ended and where Zionist nationalism began. In the end, the
sanctity ascribed to the Jewish people in the religious sense was transferred to them in
the ethnic sense. They no longer constituted a religious community but rather became an
organic peoplehood with organic ties that bound them together to the exclusion of all
others. Against this background, Zionist leaders such as Asher Ginsberg began to speak of
a Jewish &#147;supernation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from the obvious difference of racial identity, Zionism has remained
conspicuously akin to Pan-Germanism. They both believed in racial theories and
presumptions on matters such as &#147;national character&#148; and
&#147;exclusiveness&#148;. In an article entitled, &#147;Zionism in Germany&#148;, Gerhart
Holdheim, a German Zionist official wrote in a 1930 edition of <i>Suddeutsche Monatshefte </i>(No.
12), &#147;The Zionist programme encompasses the conception of a homogeneous, indivisible
Jewry on a national basis. The criterion for Jewry is hence not a confession of religion,
but the all-embracing sense of belonging to a racial community that is bound together by
ties of blood and history and which is deep in its national individuality.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Decades after Holdheim wrote his article, a nineteen-member committee of
prominent British Jews issued a report in March 2000 entitled, <i>A Community of
Communities</i>, urging members of their community to cast off their religious identity
and &#147;rebrand&#148; themselves as an ethnic minority. The amazing similarity between
these two studies proves that Zionism like the proverbial leopard is incapable of changing
its nature. Thus, whereas Zionism requires a Jew to prove his Jewishness by being a blind
supporter of Israel, Pan-Germanism as advocated by the Nazis proclaimed that all peoples
of the Aryan race owed their foremost loyalty to Germany, the <i>Heimat</i>. Ariel Sharon
summed up the Zionist view when he said, &#147;The first and the most supreme value is the
good of the State. The State is the supreme value.&#148; </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The practice of Zionist racism</b></u><br>
In order to carry out the exploitation, repression and expulsion of native peoples,
settler colonialism always denied their humanity wherever it took root. In South Africa
the Dutch, and later German and French settlers, systematically tried to dehumanize the
African population. Similarly, in Palestine, the Zionists consistently denied the
existence and humanity of the Palestinians. This vulgar obsession for racial supremacy has
been a permanent feature of the Israeli discourse both before the UN resolution of 1975
and after its revocation in 1991. It was epitomized in Golda Meir&#146;s infamous outburst
in 1969 that &#147;there is no such thing as Palestinians.&#148; Similar slurs were
reflected in the writings and speeches of Meir Kahane who throughout the 1980s led forays
into Arab villages addressing their residents as &#145;dogs&#146; and telling them to
leave the country. The former Sephardi Chief Rabbi, Ovadia Yosef, currently spearheads
this tradition. To mark the anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre on 9 April 2001, he
declared, &#147;We must show them no mercy; we must bomb them with missiles and
exterminate those evil and cursed Arabs.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Deep-rooted hatred of this kind is not confined to the Israeli religious
establishment. It is also at the core of its educational system and institutions. Recent
academic studies confirm that Israeli school textbooks and children&#146;s storybooks
portray Palestinians and Arabs as unenlightened, inferior, fatalistic and unproductive.
After conducting a study of 124 elementary, middle and high school texts on grammar,
history, geography and Hebrew literature, Professor Daniel Bar-Tal of Tel Aviv University
verified that there has been no significant change in the country&#146;s curriculum since
the 1950s. He reported that although these books contain less direct denigration of Arabs,
they still continue to stereotype them in negative and retrograde modes. In their
self-appointed role as bearers of civilization, the Zionist have even usurped the right to
write the history of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel. Though constituting one million
(one-fifth of Israel&#146;s population), the Palestinian Arabs hold less than 1% of the
jobs in the country&#146;s Ministry of Education. As a result, they have no input into the
textbooks used in their schools, even though they are written in Arabic. Wherever similar
practices were uncovered in the West, they were condemned as &#145;institutionalized
racism&#146; or &#145;ethnic bigotry.&#146; In Zionist Israel they are slavishly
whitewashed and condoned by the United Nations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although Israeli textbooks depict the Palestinians as &#145;cruel&#146;,
&#145;bloodthirsty&#146;, &#145;killers&#146; and &#145;robbers&#146;, the history of the
last ten months demonstrates just the opposite. More than 520 Palestinians were killed,
five times as many Israelis during the same period. The military elite who have ruled
Israel in the name of democracy since 1948 have lost no opportunity to loot, pilfer and
destroy Palestinian property. The seizure of Orient House and the theft of large
quantities of official documents represents yet another chapter of Zionist
totalitarianism.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionism and the Palestinian right of return </b></u><br>
Of all the discriminatory laws and practices of Zionism, none can match the Israeli Law of
Return for its inequity. This law, which was enacted on 5 July 1950, affords to every
member of the &#147;Jewish people&#148; born anywhere in the world the right to immigrate
to Israel and become a citizen upon arrival. At the same time, it denies this right to
Palestinian Muslims and Christians who were born in Palestine and expelled during the
successive wars of occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although Israel claims to be a modern democracy, it still refuses to
promulgate a democratic constitution (as required by UN resolution 181) &#147;guaranteeing
to all persons equal and non-discriminatory rights in civil, political, economic and
religious matters.&#148; Instead, it prefers to rule by an array of so-called Basic Laws.
While the Law of Return seeks to ensure the constant increase of Israel&#146;s Jewish
population, its legal adjunct, the Nationality Law enacted in 1952 aims to limit the
growth of the Palestinians. Thus, whereas the latter guarantees automatic citizenship to
Jews through immigration, residence, birth and naturalization, it enforces a completely
different set of rules and conditions for Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If ever the world became oblivious to the racist nature of Zionism,
Israel&#146;s Law of Return continues to be a shocking reminder of this fact. In practice,
it contravenes international human rights laws as well as the human rights provisions
enshrined in Articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter. Rights, which according to
Article 80 (1), should be guaranteed to &#147;any peoples.&#148; Instead of discouraging
debate on the subject, the UN Human Rights Commission should immediately discharge its
moral obligation and restore resolution 3379, which equates Zionism with racism. Every
attempt to whitewash Zionism serves only to encourage Israel&#146;s military occupation of
Palestinian land. As long as Zionism is legitimized, Israel will continue to deny
Palestinian rights, flout international law, destabilize the Middle East and perpetuate
the cycle of war that has now become endemic to the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Martin Buber, the former leader and later critic of Zionism, had no doubt
about the way forward: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only an internal revolution can have the power to heal our people of their
murderous sickness of causeless hatred (for the Arabs). It is bound to bring complete ruin
upon us. Only then will the old and young in our land realize how great was our
responsibility to those miserable Arab refugees in whose towns we have settled Jews who
were brought from afar, whose homes we have inherited, whose fields we now sow and
harvest, the fruits of whose gardens, orchards and vineyards we gather, and in whose
cities that we robbed; we put up houses of education, charity and prayer while we babble
and rave about being the &#145;people of the book&#148; and the &#147;light of the nations
(Ner, Jan-Feb 1961) !&#148;</p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Zionism is not merely the expression of nationalism but, in its
conception and execution, a form of western colonialism that views Palestinians as an
inferior people and treats them as disposable.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apartheid South Africa and Israel caused the main discussions in the
previous two world anti-racism conferences - 1978 and 1983. South Africa has since been
liberated and anti-racism activists around the world are demanding Israel be discussed at
the Durban anti-racism conference. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why this clamour from activists, scholars and international civil society?
Because Zionism is racism and Israel - Zionism in practice - is an apartheid state. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;There is no such thing as a Palestinian people.&quot; - Golda Meir. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;There is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to
neighbouring countries ... all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be
left.&quot; - Joseph Weitz, 1967. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The only good Arab is a dead Arab When we have settled the land, all
the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged
cockroaches.&quot; - Rafael Eitan, Likud, 1981. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;It is forbidden to be merciful to them ... Evil ones, damnable ones.
May the Holy Name visit retribution on the Arabs' heads, and cause their seed to be lost,
and annihilate them ...&quot; - Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas, 2001. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Minister of the Interior Eli Yesha's response to Yosef: &quot;They
reflected the overall state of thinking of the Israeli Jewish society.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clearly, Zionism is a theory of ethnic cleansing and racism. It's not just
Jewish nationalism as often argued. It was created as political nationalism in the heart
of Europe to grab land belonging to people far away. And it carried the European
ideological view of non-Europeans as insignificant</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the basis of this view, apartheid Israel developed an elaborate system
of discriminatory policies and laws to subjugate the natives. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the world's most discriminatory practices is Israel's policy of
&quot;redeeming&quot; the land by placing ownership exclusively in Jewish hands. Israel
Shahak wrote: &quot;The land which has been redeemed is the land which has passed from
non-Jewish to Jewish ownership ... The land which belongs to non-Jews is, on the contrary,
considered to be unredeemed.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The notion that land possessed by the other remains &quot;unredeemed&quot;
is the worst kind of national chauvinism. Racism? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel's Law of Return is another racist law. By it the state must
accommodate any Jews from anywhere in the world that might, at any time, migrate to
Israel. If four-million Jews suddenly emigrate to Israel/Palestine, the Israeli government
will accommodate them. In contrast, four-million Palestinians that were dispossessed of
their land and forced into exile when Israel was formed have no right of return because -
in Ehud Barak's words - it would be &quot;national suicide&quot;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">National suicide when the returnees are Palestinians wanting to return to
the land of their birth but not when the immigrants are foreign Jews? Racism? (How
foreigners to a land can &quot;return&quot; to it is itself amazing.) </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How many nations in the world today openly boast of segregation? A Barak
campaign billboard in 1999 proclaimed: &quot;Peace Through Separation: Us Here Them Over
There.&quot; Racism? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli apologists make much of &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot; (Palestinians
within the 1948 borders) being &quot;allowed&quot; to vote. Yet they exist as third-class
Israeli citizens. They are discriminated against for housing, education, social services,
welfare benefits and employment. Electricity, sewerage, roads and water are provided free
to Israeli households while many Palestinian communities in Israel still do not have
adequate services. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this cannot compare to the discrimination in West Bank and Gaza. Sixty
percent of West Bank land is &quot;owned&quot; by Israelis in settlements regarded as
illegal by international law. In Gaza 6 000 settlers own 42 % of the land. An Israeli
settler in Gaza consumes 2 000m3 of water while a Palestinian is allowed only 120m3!
Racism? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli inhabitants are required to carry identity cards. Shahak says
these can list the official nationality of a person - Jewish, Arab, Druze ... - but not
Israeli. When left-wing Israelis applied for identity cards identifying them as Israeli or
Israeli-Jew, the Interior Ministry rejected their requests. A &quot;democracy&quot; that
requires citizens' identity cards stipulating ethno-religious identity without mentioning
nationality? Racism? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I believe Zionism is racism,&quot; said Rabee' Sahyoun,
&quot;because I am a Palestinian, and without recognising the colonialist component in
Zionism, I cannot explain its racist character, a Western movement uprooting the native
peoples of Palestine: Muslim, Christian, Jew, Samaritan alike ... I believe Zionism is
racism because it fails to admit that the minority indigenous Jewish community in
Palestine that lived there for the past 2 000 years was an indistinguishable people from
its Christian and Muslim Palestinian brethren, and that the leader of the Jewish community
of the Jewish quarter of Old Jerusalem, Rabbi Lamram Blau, stood on the side of his
Palestinian brothers and sisters being exiled in 1948.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Six decades ago the world watched as Jews were humiliated, despised,
projected as unworthy of respect, dignity or legal protection and faced state terrorism.
By the end of the Holocaust, the world said &quot;Never again!&quot; Today the world
watches as Palestinians are humiliated, despised, projected as unworthy of respect,
dignity or legal protection and face state terrorism. Again? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;It is extraordinary,&quot; said Lord Yehudi Menuhin, &quot;how
nothing ever dies completely. Even the evil which prevailed yesterday in Nazi Germany is
gaining ground in that country [Israel] today.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Erik Paul</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The human bomb that detonated himself on Thursday, 9 August, in a
crowded Jerusalem restaurant during the busy lunch hour came as no surprise. After nearly
a year of political assassinations, shooting children at random, blowing up homes,
demolishing houses, uprooting trees, enforcing closures and curfews, isolating one
Palestinian area from another, starving and economically strangulating the Palestinians,
Israelis could expect little else.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps it is just what Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon really
wants. He kills off Palestinians right and left, he brutalizes them, he makes life as
miserable as he can for them knowing full well that there are young Palestinian men
seething with anger who are willing to die so that the rest of Palestine can be free.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once these human bombs blow themselves up taking as many Israelis as
they can with them, then Sharon finds his excuse to wage an even greater war against the
civilian Palestinian population. When his war escalates, Sharon thinks he can get away
with more evil and take away more of the Palestinians&#146; human and inalienable rights
from them. He knows full well that American President George Bush is an idiot without an
ounce of intelligence and he also knows that the Arab leaders are impotent and have no
desire to stop the carnage being waged against the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It really makes no sense that Palestinians must die and be brutalized
by a people who have no business being there on their land in the first place. Since all
Jews came from some place else, like Europe, Russia or America, it makes no sense that
they are taking away a country not their own and annihilating the indigenous inhabitants
at the same time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course the Israeli war State is supported and defended by the
American government. How ironic that the Americans who once struggled so valiantly for
their own freedom are so ready to criticize the Palestinians in their own fight for
liberty and the Americans even condone the way the Israelis take more land and kill more
Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though Bush expresses his outrage at the Palestinian human bombs, he is
silent about the terror that is constantly inflicted on the Palestinian civilian
population. He said about the Jerusalem bombing, &#147;The deliberate murder of innocent
civilians is abhorrent to all.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But where was Bush when an Israeli helicopter rocket attack earlier
this month in the West Bank city of Nablus killed 6 Hamas members and two children? Such
indiscriminate bombings only increase the chances of Palestinians risking their lives to
liberate their people. Where was Bush when more than 500 Palestinians were killed? And
where was he when more than 13,000 were injured, many of them permanently? And where is he
when the Palestinians are losing between $7 million to $10 million a day because of
Israeli oppression?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where was Bush when Israelis beat Palestinians to death? How does he
expect the Palestinians to go on suffering without fighting back?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I watched the news yesterday about what happened in Jerusalem. I hate
to see anyone hurt. I hate to see anyone killed. But as Israelis have tears to cry for
themselves and their loved ones, so do the Palestinians. When Palestinian mothers lose
their children, no one hears them cry or sees their tears and no one cares. When
Palestinian children are orphaned because of Apache helicopters bombing their fathers by
remote control, no one is concerned.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole world watches as Palestinians die every day. The whole world
does nothing. The Arab leaders could not care less, and they are too far immersed in their
useless lives to even call for a summit. They are blinded by their own greed and
self-complacency. And as long as this vast sea of indifference continues and as long as
Sharon practices his latest form of murder and oppression, then there will be human bombs
that will detonate at any moment and at any place. No Israeli is safe.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">A Letter from Nablus</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just when I thought that the brief images on television, the few
commentaries and news reports had honestly depicted the Israeli carnage in Nablus on
Tuesday, 31 July, I received a letter from a friend who attended the funeral of the eight
victims comprised of several activists, a journalist and two children. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since I am fully aware of the often mislead and often biased American
media, I did my best to process the news of the massacre in a different fashion than CNN
and others described it; the &quot;militants&quot;, as CNN called them, were honest
political leaders, well known and highly respected; although the faces of the children and
their family were hardly broadcast, I did my best to imagine the grief of their mother; I
tried to picture the innocent and perplexed looks on the faces of the two young brothers,
aged 6 and 11, as they were hit by Israeli missiles; I imagined them holding hands and
prayed that they didn't suffer before they died; I strived to comprehend the
incomprehensible level of anger and the growing sense of betrayal that all Palestinians
must feel as they are left alone battling Israeli F-16 warplanes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet when I thought that I understood too well how the Palestinian people
handled their newest massacre, which came only one day after another massacre of six young
Palestinian men in the West Bank town of Jenin on Monday, 30 July, the Nablus message came
to tell me that what I thought I knew was hardly enough. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I humbly apologize for not replying earlier to your message of
condolence and for your support regarding the wounding of a friend of mine in the latest
attack,&quot; my friend began. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;But I was in some sort of a challenge; I've decided not to write
back while I was disappointed, depressed and full of tears. It was the worst day in my
life when eight Palestinians got slaughtered in cold blood, as if a lesser God had created
them. Two young brothers who looked like angels have been massacred, while the whole world
is watching. Their funeral scene is printed in my mind; I will never ever forget it until
the end of my life. I have been feeling very sick; I could not eat for almost three days;
I was devastated when I saw the face and tears of their mother; I felt that the eyes of
all the grieving mothers were asking so many questions. I felt so little. Where were we?
And why weren't we able to protect those martyrs, their dreams and their future?&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My friend went on; &quot;I do understand what you meant by saying,
&#145;My greater fear is what would happen next&#146;, and my question is, what can Israel
do to us more than what it had already done? Fighting for something as revered as
Palestine deserves every possible outcome; either we will keep living like slaves, or we
will die with honour and dignity.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the tearful words of my friend in Nablus were nothing worth mentioning
here in the U.S., where the media has either lost its ability to differentiate between the
victim and murderer, or has intentionally turned a blind eye to the legitimacy of the
Palestinian struggle against the vicious occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Within two days, 30-31 July, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon through
his policy of assassination has managed to kill 16 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
But the number was hardly shocking to the U.S. media; the U.S. Vice President scrambled to
find a proper justification to Israel's killings, and lawmakers in Congress dishonestly
blamed Arafat for the violence, as they always do. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the number 16 sprung again, a few days later, when a young Palestinian
man blew himself up in a crowded pizza parlor in Jerusalem on Thursday, 9 August, killing
16 people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sadly, 16 and 16 are apparently two different numbers with two completely
different values, as it depends on who is being counted. The American media reacted to the
killing of 16 Israelis with dismay and disgust; no one had enough courage to ask what
could drive a young man to blow himself up? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But U.S. commentators here tell you &quot;nothing could justify the death
of children.&quot; How about the Palestinian children? How about the two Nablus brothers
and dozens of others? Why were their deaths justifiable? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many have conveniently forgotten to link the Jerusalem bombing to earlier
events. Many have failed to admit that when a nation is under blockade, a policy of
starvation, constant assassinations and systematic killings; when people are beaten
senselessly in the streets; when children's schools are raided by Apache helicopters; when
F-16s bombard villages and towns; when no one feels safe anymore; when a whole nation is
being cornered, collectively abused and collectively violated; without any protection,
while their occupier is backed by the United States and the rest of the world is largely
apathetic to their plight, there is nothing left but young men blowing themselves up. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If only someone would stand and boldly ask the question: Who is occupying
who? What business does the Israeli army have in the West Bank and Gaza? What legal or
moral rights does a war criminal like Sharon have to hold open meetings where he openly
presents names of Palestinians that are to be assassinated&#133;and why does the U.S. turn
a blind eye? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We can no longer fool ourselves; warmongers like Sharon have always and
will always be there; the real problem is that such a man is on the loose, hungry for the
blood of a dying nation. The problem is the racist mentality that would look down at 16
dead Palestinians and cry endlessly only for the Israeli victims. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon is not alone in this; he is backed by ignorance, by racism and by
the controlled American media and government. Once former American President Bill Clinton
said angrily while commenting on a suicide bombing in Israel that he wished to enter the
heads of those young men and see what could drive them to commit such acts; but I say, you
need not enter anyone's head; just enter a refugee camp and attend a funeral of a
Palestinian martyr and you might understand. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My friend in Nablus concluded his letter saying, &quot;I still hope for a
better tomorrow for your children and mine; I have faith in Allah the most powerful, God
willing one day we will have the right to self-determination. Never say it is impossible,
say 'I will try', then give it your best.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 31 July 2001, Palestine was in a complete state of frustration. No one
was thinking straight. Before the blood of the six men who were assassinated in al-Fara'a
on 30 July could cool, Israeli missiles were used to murder eight Palestinians on 31 July.
Riots in the streets relayed angry voices that condemned the Israeli government and
Defense Forces for shooting Palestinian leaders in their homes, offices or during their
comings and goings. It did not fail to register among our population that the Israeli
helicopter pilots spun away in terrible arrogance, untouched by the deaths of the two
young boys just walking by on 31 July. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Teary Palestinian faces, questioning eyes and broken hearts look out
beyond funeral processions at the passiveness of almost everyone everywhere. We see
self-interest among Arab leaders of other nations or areas unscathed by the Zionist ticks
and fleas itching themselves into our skin. Across the Atlantic, Americans display
indifference encouraged by the lack of news about what our lives have become and bolstered
by the sordid story of a missing woman who just happens to be Jewish and a Congressman who
has become an embarrassment, an expendable sort, if nothing else. I wonder whether or not
he has discovered, as we have, what it's like to be a victim of a world that simply
doesn't care whether you survive or not. What must he say to his family about his exposure
and a nation of people so willing to throw the first stone, so eager to condemn and
destroy not only the man but his family as well? America and other disinterested
international governments sit astonished yet unmoved by the Congressman&#146;s story full
of immoral implications and by the immoral implications of Zionist aspirations now acted
out at the expense of my generation and the one that went before it and the one that will
go after it. Most of the world can only ask, &quot;When will it end?&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In America, I'm told, muted tones of sly dissent convey only modified
indifference that endlessly fails to echo our anger. Would Americans care more had they
realized sooner that it is not only we Muslims who die in the streets, but Arab
Christians, too? I want to scream out to everyone who ever felt sorry for oppressed people
and say over and over again, &quot;It isn't enough to be sorry; you have to dare to be
outraged.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since 30 July, Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, Jenin, Gaza, all over our
territory, chaos reduces any ambitions of truce to ashes. We all realize that what
happened could not have happened without the collaboration of some Palestinians who
provide information to the Israelis. Otherwise, how could the enemy know so well where
Palestinian activists sit on any given night? We cannot bear the Palestinian traitors who
bolster the occupation anymore. We were taught about collaboration long ago, but only now
are the teachings becoming clear. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, the crowds in the streets make themselves heard, if not to the world,
at least to the Palestinian Authority. &quot;Clean up this Palestinian house. Get rid of
those who dip in our blood to add nurture to their own daily bread.&quot; Our people shout
their anger, but a few hours later a Palestinian is shot and killed in Bethlehem; this
time, not by the Israelis. &quot;He deserved to die. He was a collaborator,&quot; the rest
of us are told. We look at each other in dismay. Who can we believe? Who did this killing?
Was it we ourselves? Have we been so gulled by our enemy that we have no trust left in
ourselves? In our confusion, we are acting out our degradation of our worst elements,
forgetting entirely about our dreams of democracy and decency. Our people respond without
allowing a trial, without proof, but rather with hideous vindictiveness turned inward as
we impotently fail to chase away our true enemy. We scream about faulty justice across one
gully or another in Israel, and then we perpetrate injustice among ourselves. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I think about collaborators recently shot in Gaza and Bethlehem, I
begin to remember when I first heard of collaborators. I was leaving class as a young
teenager. An older student grabbed my arm and pulled me over to the side of the hall. She
shoved a small book in my backpack and whispered, &quot;Read it and pass it on.&quot;
Surprised, I pulled the book out to take a look. The story was about a Palestinian
collaborator, Mazen al-Fahmawi, tricking young Palestinians into sexual promiscuity and
drug addictions and, then, blackmailing them into committing crimes against their own
people. Was this story about a real person, I wondered? Why did she give me this book? The
idea of the story chilled me then and chills me still. Knowing the insufficiency of
youthful life in Palestine, I can imagine the lure of rewards slyly offered by Shabak,
Israel's intelligence agency, or deceitfulness by our own organizations that draw their
financial strength from the other side of Road Number One. I know the dreadful payoff for
those who are caught. I know that there is no mercy because the perpetrator was tricked,
or poisoned by drugs or fear. I know that age, experience and level of knowledge do not
matter. In the story of Mazen al-Fahmawi, he dies as soon as he confesses, strangled by
his own boot laces. But, then, was it his immorality or the sins of others that the story
meant to impart? Terrified, I burned the book. I've said nothing about it until now. I did
not pass it on. I did not want people to know about such shame among us. When
&#147;Intifada One&#148; came, I knew that the collaboration story carried many meanings
in our society. After the years that my generation fought back and fought to get the
world's attention, collaboration vanished in the public consciousness. A few men faced
rushed trials and quick deaths, but these were dark and stormy night-lynchings, inhumane
and unlawful, similar to evils carried out by racial hatred or turf wars among gangs in
big cities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, as I try not to focus on the chaos that rages a few miles from my
home, I am full of memories; my confusion is more current. Did Shabak agents circulate
that story about Mazen al-Fahmawi to make us suspicious of each other and able to justify
and accept murdering our own people or is that the only way to &quot;clean up the
Palestinian house?&quot; Did Mazen die guilty or innocent? How has the reaction to the
suggestion dramatized in that story passed on to me, and no doubt many others, added to
our confusion? Was the accusation, like the attack against the Congressman and the intern,
a design to make us distrust and fear even those in our own homes or was it real? I am
afraid the Mazen al-Fahmawi story was the small wind blowing in the eye of the storm to
set us against ourselves, and the Congressman's story a distraction to cover evil in the
shifting sands of the deserts, here and far away. I can hear those in the West say,
&quot;Ah, Samah, that's conspiracy theory again. No one will believe you.&quot; But, I
can't help thinking it. There are no pretty thoughts in my head now. We all know someone
in the mindless violence around us that has taken the blame. Defiled are the unfortunate,
the nave, the disposable, the Mafia's errand boys who die for the sins of their fathers.
Often the &quot;flunky&quot; dies at the hand of the very one that paid for his services
leaving no trail to the real collaborator. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Within the terms of their deaths, collaboration does indeed continue, even
during the lulls or truces that come so seldom now. We reject our neighbours; we reject
ourselves. We are all held hostage by the warranted and unwarranted suspicions instilled
in us. Evil has encompassed us. My mind turns to terrorism. Terrorism, like collaboration,
is the result of desperation. In 1948, the United Nations, harassed by strong Western
allies, illegally agreed to give Zionists more than half our land, land that neither the
UN nor the allies owned. The Zionists came with an army and their own terrorists and took
77% of our property by force. That was about 20% more land than the UN had already
unjustly allocated. Who then were the terrorists and the collaborators? My grandparents
were present; my grandmother is still able to relate the story. The siege and all that it
implies is true. Yet, we have no museum in which Hollywood moguls pay millions to preserve
my grandmother's memory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Never again,&quot; the famous phrase echoed in Holocaust Museums,
does not apply to us. Who does &quot;never again&quot; apply to? In 1967, Israelis,
financed by Zionist-pressured Americans of Jewish faith and the American government, took
another 23% of the land that was left. There is a pattern to this. How can the world not
see it? A powerful government collaborates with and supports a weaker one, a group willing
to settle in a location that is of strategic importance to the powerful government. What
was the broker thinking in this unlawful land deal? Who was tricking whom? Times goes on.
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Tenet come from America to &quot;suggest&quot; ways to accomplish
peace. They coin politically correct vocabulary to tell our Palestinian government that
they must control their own Palestinian people, our non-army, our angry youth. It is up to
Palestinians to stop Palestinians, we are told, and to join with Israelis to ensure
&quot;security coordination.&quot; What naked collaboration does this suggest? How is it
politically correct or rational for our government, supposedly defending our space, to
entertain the idea of &quot;security coordination&quot; with those who first took 77%,
then another 23% and now seek to put us all in a few bantustans if they dare not implement
a &quot;final solution&quot;? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America once again manipulatively plies the double standard that got us
into this mess in the first place&#151;the American leadership terrified of losing its
financial support and power just like Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman before them. Ah, the power of suggestion! Said Truman, &quot;I have no Arabs among
my constituents.&quot; We cannot fail to see the irony. Who are the collaborators and who
are the terrorists? Are they the teenagers with messages in their pockets or rocks in
their skinny hands, the desperate leadership in our country, kept in place by the
oppressors, the corrupt among us or those who pay the bill? It may be all of the above
unless one stops to think that ironically, instead, it may be those who turn their heads
the other way and choose not to know or, at best, to speak in timid fear of being called a
name? I want to say to Americans as to my own people, &quot;It's not enough to be
nice.&quot; Are you not mindful of truth and of your own culpability? Is there anyone out
there who has the courage of outrage to stand against this wretched tide? When men and
women of conscience stand up and recognize immorality as immorality, then we Palestinians
will be able to respond to the endlessly repeated question, &quot;When will it end?&quot;
Then, perhaps, a new kind of collaboration will begin. </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ray Hanania*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When it comes to reaching a just peace in the Middle East, American policy<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>thrives on double standards and
hypocrisy<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No place is that more apparent than at the United Nations, the very spot
where the Middle East conflict began some 53 years ago. With the United<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>States threatening to retaliate by
withholding important foreign aid, the UN<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>voted
Nov. 27, 1947 to impose an unworkable land partition on Palestine<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But while the world pays the tab for the heavy cost of American hypocrisy<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">, </font>the United States doesn't pay its own
debts. The United States is more than $<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">
3.3 </font>billion behind in paying its UN dues<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma"
SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That is remarkable that a nation that hasn't met its membership
responsibilities continues to use its position to bully others into<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>conforming to its selfish political
agendas<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some liken the American-UN relationship to that of a man who abandons his<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>wife. You use her, and when you are
done, you throw her out in favor of<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>someone
new<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In November 1947, it was the United States that pushed for the infamous
vote to divide Palestine into six criss-crossing and unworkable land sections that<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>were to represent the so-called Jewish
and Palestinian states<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They had to have UN support. But once they got it, the value of the United<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Nations quickly diminished<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since 1948, the United States has used its veto powers to block criticism
of<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Israel more than in any other
circumstance. These hypocritical American<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>vetoes
have not been swayed by things like &quot;justice&quot; or &quot;fairness.&quot; The first<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>American Security Council veto was cast
in 1970 to protect Britain against a<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>resolution
calling for an end to the Apartheid system in Rhodesia (now<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Zimbabwe). The second was in 1972, to
shield Israel from criticism of its violent policies- cast by, non-other, that former
President George Bush<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">,</font> the current
president's father<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ever since, the United States has cast or threatened to cast its veto in<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>defense of Israel more than on any other
single issues. After all, while the<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>United
States can't seem to find the cash to bring its UN membership up-to-date, it doesn't mind
dipping into the pocket books of its own<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>tax-paying
citizens to give Israel some $6 billion a year in grants, loans<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>and loan guarantees<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli propaganda machine is very sensitive to the issue of American
tax dollars being used to shore up Israel's weak economy, and the issue is a<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>major part of pro-Israel activism plans
widely distributed by AIPAC<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">,</font>
Israel's<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Washington-based lobbying
organization<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How does Israel really spend that money? AIPAC will pounce upon any member
of<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Congress who even asks about the
annual budget appropriations to Israel much<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">
</font>like a wild-eyed pit-bull or Rottweiler drooling with hunger for a bloody<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>fight. It's a habit that Israel picked
up watching its mentor, the United<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>States,
react to United Nations members who don't fall in line<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Arab countries rightly said they would raise the issue of Israel's<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>mistreatment of the Palestinian
civilians &quot;living&quot; under its occupation at<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma"
SIZE="2"> </font>the Racism Conference at Durban, South Africa, the United States stepped
in<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>and warned that not only will it
boycott the conference but it will also<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>withhold
funds<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Never mind that debating such issues is what Democracy is supposed to be<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>about. And never mind that the Racism
Conference will also address other<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>important
issues, such as reparations for the American descendants of<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Africans brought to the United States as
slaves in the 17th and 18th<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>centuries<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Three times this year, the United States said it would veto a proposal by
the<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Palestinians to bring in
&quot;monitors&quot; to help bring the violence to an end<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>issue of
placing an observer force at scenes of conflict seems to be<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>something the United States favors
almost every place else, except in<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Palestine<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To be approved, a resolution like that proposed by the Palestinians would<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>require nine votes in support of
passage, and no veto from any of the five<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>permanent
members of the UN Security Council which controls the UN's policies<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If there were UN monitors placed in the West Bank, the world would see<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>quickly that the violence is being
provoked by Israel. It would show that the<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">
</font>very fact that there are six times as many Palestinian deaths as Israeli<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>deaths and that most of the Palestinians
killed are civilians while Israeli<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>deaths
involve professional soldiers, proves that Israel must be a major part<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>of the cause of the violence<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The issue of neutral observers coming in to monitor any situation is a
sure<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>giveaway about who is right
and who is wrong, even when it doesn't pass. The<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma"
SIZE="2"> </font>person committing the crime is usually the one who doesn't want any
outsiders watching while engaged in criminal activity. The victim always wants an<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>outside monitor to prove their case<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel's refusal to permit outside observers to determine who is starting
the<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>violence is an indictment of
Israel's guilt<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel never feels any guilt in its brutal policies against the
Palestinians.<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>After all, the Jewish
State was built upon a policy of evicting the<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma"
SIZE="2"> </font>Christians and Muslims from their lands and homes<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Palestinians try to complain about that brutality and land theft<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">, </font>too, there is the United States,
standing up on both feet, arms waving in the<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma"
SIZE="2"> </font>air and voices loudly threatening to &quot;veto<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">!&quot; </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At some point, you might think that the United Nations might cast a veto<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>against the United States. If you don't
pay your dues, you don't get to<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>exercise
your veto<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That might motivate the United States to take one of those hefty checks it<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>sends over to Israel, and re-endorse it
to the United Nations<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there is one common characteristic that bullies like Israel and the
United States seem to share. When they are beating up on someone<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">,</font> bullies<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>never feel any guilt<font
FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Amman- </strong>It was probably one of the most important weddings
of the summer. Everybody who was anybody attended the gala affair. It was a perfect summer
marriage and the couple to be wed were the perfect mates. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the way to the wedding hall, countless bouquets of extravagant flowers
lined the passageway to the grand affair. The parents of the bride stood at the entrance
of the hall, smiles lighting their faces. At last they had found the perfect suitor for
their not-so-Cinderella daughter. Yet, she was the catch of the season, the daughter of
rich parents and the man she married would be set for life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The parents of the groom stood next to the bride&#146;s parents. Their
faces beamed even brighter than the bride&#146;s. They looked like characters out of a
scene from rags to riches. Sudden wealth meant instant happiness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Inside the plush hall, guests paraded throughout the corridors. There they
were, the elite of Jordanian society. A startling fact presented itself almost
immediately. Though most people wore the latest fashions&#151;women in low-cut and
sleeveless gowns with slits up to their thighs and puffed-up, dyed hairdos, and the men
strutted around in their constrained suits&#151;their affluence did not make them any more
attractive. Money does not necessarily go hand in hand with beauty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this did not seem to matter at all. As long as people blindly followed
the vogue, attractive or not, being beautiful or not did not seem to matter. Golden
chandeliers hung low over ornate tables, casting a soft yellow glow over the merry makers.
Women with flabby arms and bulges bursting through tight gowns sat around with painted
faces attempting to look intelligent. Somehow something very vital appeared to be missing
even though most of the guests had become slaves to Western fashion in a realm of
invisible American colonial occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly there was the sound of drums and on the screen at the end of the
darkened room, scenes of people dancing out in the street just before the entrance to the
hallway flashed before dazzled eyes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The parents of the bride and the parents of the groom danced in the street
to the accompaniment of bagpipes and drums. Then the almost charming couple now to be wed
was ushered in amidst intense clapping and exuberant dancing. And at last they made their
grand entrance. He the lucky fellow, she the luckier bride.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Inside, the hired band beat to the tune of the excitement and the guests
rushed to capture on film the moments of a lifetime. Camera lights popped and camcorders
recorded the spectacular event. To the music, the not-so-Cinderella bride and the
not-so-handsome prince danced while painted eyes looked on. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was all too perfect or nearly so. After the dancing, waiters wheeled in
a multi-tiered cake. The not-so-dashing groom firmly held the hand of the offbeat
Cinderella, which in turn clasped a shining silver sword. Clasped hands sliced the cake.
Purple, red and blue puffs of smoke swirled up to the chandeliers while the groom fed a
piece of the cake to the bride who in turn fed a piece of the same confection to the
groom. Yet it all looked like a surreal film where romance had gone a bit stale.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the guests then danced their shoes off. One young bald man, who
had shaved his head to conceal the embarrassing truth of his hairless top, gyrated until
he grew red in the face. Some women, heavy with affluence and expensive perfume danced in
tune to his contortions. Though no wine was served, the madness of the moment intoxicated
the participants.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then, in a grand finale, the groom serenaded the bride through the
kitchen. The cooks and waiters bowed in reverence to the moment. Rows and rows of savory
concoctions of all imaginable kinds decorated each side of a hallway. A mixture of odors
wafted through the glittering air.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The guests then lined up to serve themselves. After the feast, waiters
dumped the leftover food into trash bins and the rows and rows of bouquets were left to
wilt in someone&#146;s dreams. The groom and the bride departed and the hundreds of guests
left for home. Seven thousand dinars, the rental fee for the wedding hall, evaporated into
a swirl of smoldering ash. It had been a time to laugh, a time to be happy. But the scene
was so unreal&#133;so surreal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other side of the bridge just across the trickle of the once great
waters of the Jordan River, the scene was entirely different. The Israeli army had just
blown up a building, killing 6 Hamas members and two children. Here, some miles away from
the gala wedding, a marriage of a different sort took place. It was the merging of the
dead with their funeral processions. Here, there were no parents dancing in the streets
and no shouts of joy to celebrate the moment. Instead, there were tears and wails of the
families of the dead martyrs. There were no bouquets of flowers here. There were only
bloodstained stretchers. There was no extravagant feast, only black coffee served to the
mourners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile and elsewhere, Arab presidents, kings and dictators all slept
peacefully, oblivious to the slaughter, to the funeral processions, to the tears, to the
suffering of the living. The day following the gala wedding and the political
assassinations, the kings, presidents, all packaged tyrants, decided there was no need for
an Arab summit. After all, what were a few more Palestinian lives? And everyone knows that
Arab summits are places where nothing is accomplished except the delivery of long windy
speeches. This recycled rhetoric only ends up to be the meekest condemnation of the
ongoing Israeli atrocities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After all, it is only the Palestinian Holocaust and a time for
Palestinians to cry while for the rest of the world, it is a time to laugh. But in the
makings of the ashes of the political assassinations, human bombers have been brewing who
are ready to sacrifice their lives so that their people may be free.</p>

  </b><p ALIGN="LEFT">No wonder that Dov Halvertal, a member of the almost defunct faction
  of the NRP doves, told Golan: &#147;This Purim joy epitomizes the moral collapse of
  religious Zionism ... If religious Zionism does not undertake soul-searching right now, I
  doubt if it will ever have another opportunity.&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Subsequent developments showed that neither the religious Zionists nor
  other factions within the Jewish religious community were or are in any mood to engage in
  soul-searching. On the contrary, the appreciation of Goldstein and the feeling that Jews
  have a right and duty to kill Gentiles who live in the land of Israel are growing. In his
  March 23, 1994 <i>Haaretz </i>article, Nadav Shraggai discussed the visit of a delegation
  of all Israeli branches of the Bnei Akiva, the large youth movement affiliated with the
  NRP, to Kiryat Arba and Hebron, which was then under a curfew selectively applied to its
  Arab inhabitants. The purpose of this visit was to &#147;encourage Jewish settlers.&#148;
  Yossi Leibowitz, a settler leader from Hebron, as described by Shraggai, &#147;beaming
  with satisfaction visible in his face asked the delegation: &#145;Have you already visited
  the tomb of holy Rabbi Doctor Goldstein?&#146; &#147;The visitors rejected the suggestion
  but did not utter one word of rebuke to the worshippers of the new saint. They then had to
  withstand a flurry of abuse from their local Bnei Akiva comrades who argued that their
  refusal to pay homage to Goldstein amounted to support of the left. Local rabbis
  affiliated with the NRP seconded the denunciation. Rabbi Shimon Ben-Zion, a senior teacher
  in the local Hesder Yeshiva and hence a state employee, delivered a eulogy of Goldstein
  and of what he called &#147;his act.&#148; He added: &#147;[If the government] keeps
  bowing low to Arabs, all of whom are murderers, [and if] the Jews fail to establish a firm
  rule over the land of Israel [there will be] more Goldsteins.&#148; Most visitors made
  counter-arguments; they were nevertheless influenced by their hosts' arguments; they came
  to believe that their duty to support the Jewish settlers in Hebron was more important
  than any minor disagreements about Goldstein's sainthood.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Gabby Baron reported in the March 16, 1994 <i>Yediot Ahronot:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      </i><p ALIGN="LEFT">Deputy Minister of Education Mikha Goldman was physically assaulted
      yesterday after delivering a welcoming speech at a meeting of Jerusalem's district
      teachers in the Binyaney Ha'umah hall in that city. He managed to avoid being hurt. His
      speech infuriated dozens of religious teachers, because he talked about his visit to
      Kiryat Arba and the shock he experienced when finding how enthused the religious school
      children were by the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. A virtual riot erupted in the
      hall, which was filled by about 5000 Jerusalem district teachers, as soon as he spoke
      about it. Dozens of religious teachers jumped onto the podium. A female teacher who
      managed to reach it [the podium] picked up a flowerpot from the speaker's table; she was
      ready to hurl it at him when at the last moment she balked. All the religious teachers
      assembled in rage in front of the podium and decried the deputy minister as &#147;a
      fascist.&#148; Goldman insisted upon continuing his speech. When he ended, he had to leave
      the building under heavy guard, thanks to which the pursuing teachers were unable to
      injure him.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Neither Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein nor Prime Minister Rabin
  uttered a single word in condemnation of the incident.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">On April 5, 1994, Israeli radio reported that Rabbi Shimon Ben-Zion had
  distributed a leaflet among the Kiryat Arba and Hebron settlers requesting financial
  contributions for a book about &#147;Saint Baruch Goldstein.&#148; On April 6, <i>Yediot
  Ahronot </i>published the text. The book refers to Goldstein as &#147;Rabbi Doctor Baruch
  Goldstein of blessed memory, let the Lord avenge his blood.&#148; The Kiryat Arba
  municipal council backed the ideas of Ben-Zion. In his April 5, 1994 <i>Haaretz </i>article,
  Amnon Barzilay reported that two days earlier Gush Emunim leaders, including Mayor Benny
  Katzover, had an amicable talk with Prime Minister Rabin who apologized to them for his
  past outbursts against them and promised never to repeat them. (The outbursts anyway were
  intended for consumption of the Israeli &#147;doves,&#148; Arafat and the Western media.)
  The two sides agreed to cooperate closely in the future. Thus, Rabin understandably found
  it ill-advised to say anything about Rabbi Ben-Zion's idea.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">About one year later the Kiryat Arba municipality obtained a permit from
  the Civil Administration of the Occupied Territories to build a large and sumptuous
  memorial on Goldstein's tomb, which has become a place of pilgrimage. Thousands of Jews
  from all Israeli cities, and even more from the United States and France, have come to
  light candles and pray for the intercession of &#147;holy saint and martyr,&#148; now in a
  special section of paradise close to God and able to obtain for them various benefits,
  such as cures for diseases from which they suffer, or to grant them male offspring. The
  visitors have donated money for Goldstein's comrades. No Orthodox rabbi has criticized
  this.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The well-publicized worship of the new saint has brought increasing
  opposition from secular Jews. (The opposition of Palestinians, especially those living in
  Hebron, to the hero-worship of Goldstein and to the monument to this mass murderer are not
  within the scope of this book but should be obvious.) After a long campaign in the press,
  Knesset members passed a piece of legislation in May, 1998, that prohibited the building
  of monuments for mass murderers and ordering removal of existing ones. The Israeli army
  should have removed the monument immediately after passage of the law in the Knesset.
  Instead army spokesmen announced that negotiations over the Goldstein monument were
  on-going with Goldstein's family and local rabbis.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The book in praise of Goldstein, titled <i>Blessed the Male, </i>was
  published in 1995 and sold in many editions. Most of the readers were from the religious
  public. The book contained eulogies of Goldstein and halachic justifications for the right
  of every Jew to kill non-Jews. Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburgh, the then head of the Kever Yosef
  (tomb of Joseph) Yeshiva, located on the outskirts of Nablus, wrote one chapter of that
  book. The essence of Rabbi Ginsburgh's views were presented in Chapter 4. His and other
  such ideologies, even if expressed more cautiously, explain Goldstein's massacre, the
  considerable support Goldstein and later his followers have received from religious Jews
  and the ambiguous attitude of Israeli governments to this crime. Those people, especially
  Germans, who were silent and did not condemn Nazi ideology before Hitler came to power are
  also, at least in a moral sense, guilty for the terrible consequences that followed.
  Similarly, those who are silent and do not condemn Jewish Nazism, as exemplified by the
  ideologies of Goldstein and Ginsburgh, especially if they are Jews, are guilty of the
  terrible consequences that may yet develop as a result of their silence.</p>
  <b><h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Religious Background of Rabin's
  Assassination</font></b></h3>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered for religious reasons. The
  murderer and his sympathizers were and still are convinced that the killing was dictated
  by God and was therefore a commandment of Judaism. Comprehensive surveys, published in the
  Hebrew press, of people in religious neighborhoods and especially religious settlements
  indicated great sympathy for the murder. The polarization of approval and disapproval in
  the Israeli Jewish community over the killing of the prime minister of the Jewish state
  has increased since the time of the murder. Many Israeli Jews, significant numbers of Jews
  living outside Israel and most non-Jews do not possess sufficient knowledge of Jewish
  history and religion to put this kind of an assassination into its proper context. In this
  chapter we shall attempt to provide the historical-religious background necessary for an
  understanding of the Rabin assassination.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jewish history has been replete with religious civil wars or rebellions
  accompanied by civil wars in which horrifying assassinations were committed. The Great
  Rebellion (AD 66-73) of Jews against the Romans that culminated in the destruction of the
  Second Temple and in mass suicide in Masada is exemplary. The defenders of Masada were, as
  many present-day visitors to the Masada site are seemingly unaware, a band of assassins
  called Sikarikin, a name taken from the word for a short sword that group members hid
  under their robes and used to kill their Jewish opponents in crowds of people. In the
  Talmud the word means terrorists or robbers and is applied only to Jews. Neither Masada
  nor this particular group are mentioned in the Talmud or in any part of the traditional
  writing preserved by Jews. Actually the Sikarikin were an ancient Jewish analogue to
  modem-day terrorists. Their suicide activity resembled the terrorist behavior of the
  suicide bombers who are so abhorred in the state of Israel. The Sikarikin escaped to
  Masada not from the Romans but from their Jewish brethren. Shortly after the rebellion
  against the Romans began, the Roman army that was advancing to Jerusalem was initially
  defeated and had to withdraw. The Sikarikin attempted forcefully to establish their
  leader, Menahem, as absolute king. The Jews of Jerusalem then attacked and defeated the
  Sikarikin in the temple itself, killing most of them including Menahem. The remaining
  Sikarikin escaped to Masada where they stayed during the rebellion; they did not fight the
  Romans but instead robbed neighboring Jewish villages. Three years after the Sikarikin
  defeat, the Roman army, commanded by Titus, approached Jerusalem for the final onslaught.
  (Titus' chief of staff, Tiberius Julius Alexander, was a Jew, the nephew of the great
  philosopher, Philo.) Jerusalem was divided into three parts; each part was under the
  command of a different leader; the leaders had already been fighting with one another for
  two years. The Roman Empire at that time was then concerned about a civil war. One of the
  leaders, Eliezer the Priest, commanded the Temple and used it as his stronghold. On
  Passover eve in the year AD 70, another rebel leader, Yohanan of Gush Halav, utilized
  brilliant strategy to overcome Eliezer. He dressed his soldiers as pious pilgrims who
  seemed to be coming to the temple for the Passover sacrifice. After being admitted to the
  temple by the gullible Eliezer without a body search, they, after guessing correctly that
  Eliezer and his men would not carry arms in a place so holy, pulled out their swords and
  slaughtered all their opponents. The well-known Masada terrorists became Jewish and
  Israeli national heroes, as did the Jerusalem Jews who killed most of the Sikarikin.
  Yohanan of Gush Halav also became a national hero, but Bliezer the Priest, perhaps because
  he was killed by Jews, was completely forgotten. In these and in many similar incidents in
  Jewish history, killing was allegedly committed for the greater glory of God. Yigal Amir,
  Rabin's assassin, made such an allegation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The violence between Jews did not end with the loss of Jewish independence
  and the ceasing of Jewish rebellions. (The last Jewish rebellion occurred in AD 614.) From
  the Middle Ages until the advent of the modern state, Jewish communities enjoyed a great
  degree of autonomy. The rabbis who headed and had the authority in these communities were
  most often able to persecute Jews mercilessly. The rabbis persecuted Jews who committed
  religious sins and even more harshly persecuted Jews who informed upon other Jews to
  non-Jews or in other ways harmed Jewish interests. The rabbis generally tolerated violence
  committed by some Jews against other Jews, especially against women, so long as the Jewish
  religion and their own interests were not harmed. The relevancy of this aspect of Jewish
  history to the Rabin murder is obvious. The assassin, Yigal Amir, is a talmudic scholar
  who was trained in a yeshiva that inculcated its students to believe that this violence
  committed by rabbis over a lengthy time period was in accordance with God's word.</p>
