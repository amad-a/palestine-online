<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Apartheid is alive and well in Israel</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>Khalid Amayreh</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli lawmakers, intellectuals and even government officials are
becoming increasingly open to exploring &#147;prospective solutions&#148; for Palestinian
demographic growth in Israel and the occupied territories, with the suggested solutions
ranging from collective deportation to institutionalized apartheid. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meetings, seminars, symposia and workshops are springing up throughout the
Jewish State, all bearing, more or less, the same message: unless Israel does something to
curb Palestinian population growth, Jews will become a minority in the area of the
pre-1948 Palestine mandate (Israel and the occupied territories) within 19 years. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Monday, 16 July, the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee held
an &#147;exploratory session,&#148; in which participants discussed &#147;the Arab
demographic threat&#148; and the &#147;dangers facing the survival of Israel as a Jewish
State.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The meeting was attended by several experts, including Haifa
University&#146;s Arnon Sofer, who advocates &#147;radical solutions for solving the
looming demographic problem&#148; facing Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Calling the current demographic situation a threat to Israel&#146;s
existence, Sofer pointed out that, by the year 2020, and if the present demographic trends
were not reversed, Jews in mandated Palestine would be a minority, outnumbered by Arabs by
20%. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said that there were already equal numbers of Arabs and Jews in the
combined Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with the Jewish population reaching 4.9
million and the Arabs 4.8 million. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The number of Jews, he added, would grow to 6.4 million in 2020, with the
corresponding figure for non-Jews topping 8.8 million. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arab Knesset members denounced the meeting as &#147;naked racism,&#148;
and a &#147;big scandal in a State that claims to be civilized and democratic.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It is racist, just racist, there is no other name for it,&#148; said
Arab Knesset member Hashem Mohammed, who boycotted the meeting. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Knesset member Issam Makhoul of the Democratic Front for Peace and
Equality also castigated the meeting. &#147;If anything like this were discussed anywhere
in the world, it would be condemned as brash racism; but here, in a State that claims to
be the only democracy in the Middle East, we see dignified lawmakers candidly discussing
ways and means to curb the birth rate of a given segment of society on the grounds that
they don&#146;t have the right race and religion. It&#146;s racism; it&#146;s
disgusting.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli lawmaker and former Justice minister Dan Meridor, who chaired the
meeting, sought to defend the discussion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He argued that it was imperative that Knesset members understand the
demographic situation, which, he said, was crucial for the continuation of the Zionist
enterprise and a Jewish majority. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, when asked why only Arab demographic growth was under discussion,
Meridor had nothing to say except repeating the old Zionist mantra that Israel was a
Jewish State and that it was inadmissible for non-Jews to be allowed to make up a majority
of the population in the State. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Knesset meeting was only the latest in a plethora of secret,
semi-secret and public discussions that have been taking place of late on the sensitive
subject. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few months ago, a number of Israeli strategic planners, former army
generals and scholars met behind closed doors in Hertzlya in northern Israel to discuss
&#147;adequate solutions for dealing with the demographic threat.&#148; The Hebrew press
reported that the &#147;expulsion idea&#148; loomed large during the meeting in Hertzlya
and enjoyed &#147;unprecedented acceptance&#148; among participants. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to &#147;transferring&#148; a significant number of the
non-Jewish population out of &#147;Eretz Israel,&#148; participants also reportedly
discussed other alternatives, including institutionalized apartheid (whereby non-Jews
would be granted civil rights while denied political rights), forced sterilization,
induced immigration (through economic pressure) and &#147;other solutions.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Israeli sources, and in light of permeating political trends
in Israel, many Israelis who object to adopting &#147;transfer&#148; as an official policy
are not really opposed to the principle of expelling the Palestinians, but are rather
discouraged by what they call &#147;the logistical difficulties impeding the execution of
the idea.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the bulk of religious and right-wing Israeli parties, including
Likud, support in varied degrees &#147;the expulsion alternative&#148; and only differ on
whether it would be realistic to carry it out successfully. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, some right-wing and religious elements in Israel believe
their government should seek to induce an all-out regional war in the hope of creating
conditions conducive to expelling a significant number of Palestinians. Such thinking is
gaining a modicum of pre-eminence in the Israeli media, especially in the so-called
national camp. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians, for their part, are aware of discussions to that effect
in Israel and are reasserting their resolve not to repeat the 1948 disaster.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We will not allow them (Israel) to drive us away again. The worst
they would be able to do is to murder us, but we shall not leave again,&#148; Palestinian
Authority official Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said in a recent interview. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The growing nervousness and anxiety in Zionist circles over the
demographic question in Palestine stems from the looming &#147;dead-end&#148; to which
Zionism has reached or is bound to reach in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, in light of Zionist forecasts in this regard, it seems that Israel
and Zionism are facing three choices: first, accepting an independent Palestinian State on
the entirety of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem. This alternative
seems to be unrealistic due to the heavy proliferation of Jewish settlements in the two
territories. Indeed, the presence of so many Jewish settlements in and around Arab
population centres in the West Bank and Gaza makes it virtually impossible for Israelis
and the Palestinians to achieve &#147;separation&#148; between the two communities.
Moreover, it is unlikely that any Israeli government will agree to dismantle the
settlements or a significant number of them. Hence, it can be said without exaggeration
that the &#147;two-State solution&#148; is no longer feasible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second choice is the one-State solution whereby all of Palestine would
become one State in which Jews and Arabs would live together in a civil society. This
choice is not acceptable to Israel because it would spell the end of it as a Jewish State.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third &#147;choice&#148; is continued occupation, apartheid and
repression of non-Jews with the possibility of pursuing a strategy toward the Palestinians
based on &#147;expulsion and collective deportation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, &#147;expulsion&#148; or &#147;the repetition of the Nakba&#148;
of 1948 seems to be Israel&#146;s ultimate strategy toward the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, expulsion, while not completely ruled out, would be extremely
difficult to carry out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The international community and the Arab-Muslim world would not stand idle
while Israel carries out this doomsday scenario.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the deportation of a significant number of Palestinians to
Jordan, for example, would eventually bring about the collapse of the Hashemite dynasty
and bring the Iraqi and Iranian threat to the eastern bank of the River Jordan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, even expulsion wouldn&#146;t solve the problem for the Zionist
entity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Quite the contrary, it would complicate it further.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Who is afraid of war?</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Vulnerable, exposed and disempowered, the Palestinians under Israeli
occupation pray that the Arabs, the Muslims and the rest of the world will come to their
aid having recognized the seriousness of the situation in Palestine. With superior
military power and thorough intelligence infiltration into Palestinian ranks, the Israelis
have been liquidating what they claim to be potential &#147;perpetrators of terror,&#148;
bulldozing houses, turning Palestinian olive groves into restricted military zones and
letting loose herds of settlers who insist on proving to the world that they have very
little in common with humanity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps the most distressing thing for the Palestinians amid all the pain
and suffering is the Arab inaction and even lack of interest in what is happening to their
brethren in occupied Palestine, the bleeding heart of the Arab homeland. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Previously, Palestine was the Arab cause and prior to that it was the
Islamic cause. Now, the Palestinians feel abandoned, though their predicament is not
exclusively of their own making. While Israel escalates both its language and action, the
Arabs around Palestine continue to hide their heads in the sand, and there is no shortage
of sand in the Arab land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In spite of undeniable support and sympathy for Palestine and the
Palestinians on the part of the Arab masses, they are well short of being able to persuade
their governments to shift from inaction to action. It is no secret that many of these
governments are more interested in negative action, one involving suppressing their public
and combating any effort aimed at helping the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What should the Palestinians do in such circumstances? Materially
speaking, they are no match against the Israeli war machinery. While suffering suffocating
measures by Israeli occupation authorities, stringent controls are imposed on their
movement, trade and communication by their Arab brothers across the borders. Worst of all
has been the role played by collaborating individuals and agencies from amongst the
Palestinians themselves with their oppressors, the Israelis. Many of the assassinations
carried out by Israeli secret agents, the so-called Arabist units, might not have
succeeded without the collaboration of Palestinian traitors, not infrequently acting in
their capacity as PA officials or members of joint security teams. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is becoming increasingly evident that the days to come are likely to
bear more pain and more suffering for the Palestinians than all the days that have passed
since their predicament ensued with the creation of Israel more than 50 years ago. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, the Palestinians who live under occupation in Gaza and
the West Bank have no option but to remain steadfast in their land and to resist the
persistent Israeli attempts to drive them away. Such resistance will not be pain-free.
More than ever before the Israeli public is shifting in the direction of uprooting the
Palestinians from their homeland. Hence the election of Sharon as Prime Minister of
Israel, in spite of his war crimes records and overt anti-Arab and anti-Muslim views. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In response to my July article on Palestine, I received two messages from
Israelis who read my article with seeming disgust. What both respondents agree on, and
seem to have copied each other in expressing their opinions, is denying the Palestinians
the right to exist and despising Islam and the Muslims. One of them wrote: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;You fail to mention [that] Palestinians tell these suicide bombers
that when they kill Jews, they will go to heaven and be with 72 virgins. Can you tell me
[of] another religion so savage and evil? Then you say how Israel robbed the Palestinians
of [their] homeland. What homeland? There was never in history any State called Palestine.
The Palestinians never controlled or governed any land before 1993.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Palestinians are really unwanted Arabs from Egypt and Syria, who
immigrated to the land from 1831 to 1947. Palestine is a fake, invented Roman name, which
the Romans named after the Greek Philistines. The Palestinians are totally unrelated to
the Philistines.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other wrote:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Judea and Samaria and all of Jerusalem are liberated Israeli land.
Tell us when did it ever belong to Palestinians? Answer: never. It was never Palestinian
land to begin with, so your question is invalid. The Palestinians never governed or
controlled any land before 1993. To make it simple, please tell me one Palestinian
President before 1993. Keep thinking. The Palestinians want a capital that they never had
in a country that never existed. The Palestinians are really unwanted Arabs from Egypt and
Syria, who immigrated to the land from 1831 to 1947. Palestine is a fake, invented Roman
name, which the Romans named after the Greek Philistines. The Philistines are totally
unrelated to the current-day Palestinians. Israel existed 1,500 years before Muhammad was
born. Besides Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the entire Middle East and North Africa was stolen
from the native peoples by Muhammad in the 7<sup>th</sup> century. Anyone that resisted
Muhammad had their heads cut off. Look at Islamic countries and look at shariah laws.
It&#146;s a brutal, violent and intolerant religion. There is a primary historical fact
that must be established now. There has never been, I repeat NEVER been, a civilization,
entity or a nation referred to as Palestine. There was never a Palestinian tribe, and
there was never a Palestinian country in the land of Israel to begin with!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I do not subscribe to the opinion that all Jews think in the way those two
do. But I have no doubt in my mind that what is expressed in the messages of these two
readers is a reflection of the racist and fascist Zionist ideology. Zionism was founded on
myths created by greedy and desperate individuals. Today, it is defended and supported by
a majority of Jews and a minority of Christians who accept these myths as facts. Zionists
cherish the idea, which no respectable historian would entertain, that since the
destruction of the Second Temple at around 70 AD, Palestine remained mysteriously
unpopulated waiting for them to come back and claim it as a divine right for being
God&#146;s chosen people. It is an idea that cannot be debated around a respectable
discussion table. You simply cannot reach a middle ground on an idea, a lie, that is
illogical, unfair and merely aimed at justifying the unjustifiable and legitimizing the
illegitimate. By virtue of the exposure of Zionist beliefs, especially since Sharon took
over, it is only now that some of those who once thought they could talk sense into the
minds of Zionists in the hope of reaching some middle ground with them have begun to
realize the gravity of their ill-judgment. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians need to brace themselves for the worst, which is yet to
come. For Israel is no ordinary occupying power and its colonialism of Palestine is no
conventional imperialist project, though it shares many of the features of European
colonial enterprises. Past colonial projects ended with the occupiers withdrawing to their
motherlands, be it Britain, France, Italy, Holland, Portugal or Spain. In the case of
Palestine, Israelis are not comfortable withdrawing not even from an inch of the land they
occupy. For in spite of Arab weakness, the Israelis can never feel secure if limited to a
strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. They are haunted by the prospect of being
flushed out completely. Where would they withdraw? Some of them may know by now that they
have no future except as a Jewish community living in the region as some Jewish
communities lived there before for more than 13 centuries. But this clearly means an end
to Zionism and an end to Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the Israelis feel more threatened and vulnerable, they act less
orderly, less predictably and much more desperately. But why should the Israelis be made
more vulnerable if this is likely to backfire on the Palestinians? This is the enigma of
the vicious cycle initiated by the Israelis. Their policies, their ambitions and their
lack of confidence, which is most probably the outcome of a mixture of inherent guilt and
insecurity, are expressed eventually in one way: oppressive action against the
Palestinians, the victims of their occupation. This is the nature of tyranny. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Politicians in the Arab region, in Europe and in the United States have
constantly warned against the danger of war engulfing the region as a result of the
inability on the part of both Palestinians and Israelis to resolve their dispute. But war
has actually started. What else may one describe what the Israelis are doing? It is a war,
but one that is between a military superpower and a beleaguered civilian population. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians have no option but to take on the Israelis and meet their
challenge. It is true they have every right to be dismayed by Arab and Muslim lack of
response to Israel&#146;s atrocities. However, no one will ever rise to help them, and
coming generations will not forgive them, if they do not prove to be willing to make the
utmost of sacrifice for a cause that, in spite of a shortage of support today, is a
sublime and most honourable one. Nothing justifies giving up the struggle in anticipation
of an Arab or Muslim renaissance of some sort. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians are not short of means and methods that will deter the
Israelis and awaken them from their intoxication. If the message Israelis send to
Palestinian young men is that they are destined to lose their youth and have their lives
taken away from them by Israeli snipers or Israeli Arabist units or Israeli apache
helicopters, the response will be one of defiance rather than capitulation. Israeli
politicians and strategists are clearly mistaken if they think that the Palestinians are
afraid of war or that they would prefer a humiliating life to an honourable death.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">U.S. Zionist Lobby&#146;s ploy to defame Islam
exposed</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ramzy Baroud*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The whole thing appeared suspicious from the start; why would the American
Jewish Committee (AJC), a group with a bleak history of slandering Islam, Arabs and
Palestinians, suddenly initiate a book project that aims at enhancing &#147;mutual
understanding and reduce mutual ignorance and suspicion&#148; among Muslims and Jews? Of
course nothing is sweeter than a genuine change of heart. Maybe the AJC realized that the
language of intimidation and defamation is not productive when dealing with Muslims and
Arabs. Or maybe it was just another media ploy. Of course, only those unacquainted with
the history of the pro-Israeli Jewish lobby in the U.S. embraced the first argument. But
why refer to history, when the present itself is a truth-telling example of how the AJC
has worked diligently in recent months, lining up more support for Israel, more media bias
and more defamation of Palestinians and their Intifada? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The book project sponsored by AJC manufactured two books: one aimed at
educating Muslims about Jews and the other, &#147;Children of Abraham: An Introduction to
Islam for Jews,&#148; was presumably a handy guide for Jews to familiarize themselves with
the true Islam. The seemingly positive gesture, despite all that is known about the group
behind it, eventually turned into dynamite, destroying the possibility of a truthful
understanding between Muslims and Jews, but more dangerously, it became a tool in the
hands of many eager to scandalize Islam. The book, its author, topics, design and
depiction of Islamic history quickly alienated American Muslims and drew harsh criticism
from their leading spokesmen and organizations. In a letter to the executive director of
AJC (David Harris), Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American Muslim
Relations (CAIR), expressed his concerns regarding several aspects of the book. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Given the AJC&#146;s stated intent of promoting &#145;understanding
and mutual respect,&#146; it is puzzling as to why your organization would first of all
engage an author who has little credibility in the Muslim community, and then to add
insult to injury by using a cover image that many Muslims will find offensive,&#148; Awad
affirmed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The author of the book, 61-year-old Khalid Duran, is unpopular among
Muslims for his contribution to several projects that were seen as Islamaphobic. Duran is
a &#147;close colleague of infamous Muslim-bashers such as Steven Emerson,&#148; an author
known for his frequent attacks on Muslims and Islam, according to a statement released by
CAIR earlier. CAIR has also accused Duran of being a &#147;consultant&#148; for
Emerson&#146;s &#147;now discredited&#148; 1994 programme, &#147;Jihad in America.&#148; A
painting of the prophet Ibrahim on the cover of the book was sharply criticized by
Muslims. Muslim scholars say that depicting and drawing images of prophets can lead to
idol worship, a forbidden practice in Islam. The &#147;experts&#148; who allegedly
reviewed the book, must have known of such a fact. But the cover image, although offensive
to Muslims, is only one of many issues that angered Muslim groups in the United States.
According to Duran, 85% of the Muslim holy book, the Qur&#146;an, is &#147;open to
interpretation,&#148; criticizing Eid al-Adha&#146;s &#147;chaotic&#148; practices and
Islam&#146;s human rights record. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In terms of crimes against women, the Muslim world is second to
none,&#148; Duran was quoted by the Associated Press. Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of
fasting and worship, according to Duran, &#147;disrupts normal economic activity,&#148; in
addition to other negative effects. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Duran is also said to have co-authored a new book with Daniel Pipes,
&#147;another writer with an even longer history of Islamaphobia than Emerson.&#148; But
the close ties between Duran and Pipes are becoming more relevant after AJC reiterated
throughout the media that an Islamic group in Jordan has called for Duran&#146;s death.
Sheik Abdul-Munem Abu Zant of the Islamic Action Front, accused of issuing a Fatwa (or a
religious ruling) urging U.S. Muslims to shed Duran&#146;s blood, vehemently rejected the
widely spread allegations in the U.S. media, and told the AP that he is not even familiar
with the book mentioned. CAIR lashed out at AJC&#146;s slander campaign and accused the
publishers of the book of drumming up publicity for their &#147;deceitful book&#148; with
reports of &#147;phony Fatwas.&#148; But despite the decisive rejection of the Fatwa
claims, AJC and its patrons in the U.S. media are leading a campaign of defamation, one
that clearly contrasts the spirit of its alleged efforts to bring Jews and Muslims closer
to each other through faith. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Daniel Pipes has championed the campaign, labelling Islamic movement
members as &#147;fundamentalists&#148;, turning his friend Duran into a living martyr and
alleging that Muslims are using the &#147;Rushdie rules&#148; of Ayatollah Khomeini to
punish everyone critical of Islam. In a recent Jerusalem Post article, Pipes combined all
of his anti-Islam skills to fabricate a tragic drama in which Duran is awaiting death, a
fate imposed on him by Muslims with a &#147;Khomeini-like agenda,&#148; and called on
&#147;all Americans&#148; to &#147;safeguard&#148; Duran&#146;s security. It is yet to be
determined how the media scare will be translated in terms of book sales. But the obvious
is that all claims made by AJC and its backers in regards to the groups&#146; commitment
to &#147;advance Muslim-Jewish relations&#148; were finally exposed as a shrewd ploy to
vilify Islam and to dehumanize its followers.</p>

  <b><h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Suffer Not the Little Children</font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="center"><em>Edna Yaghi</em></b></p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><em>Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not:</em></p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><em>for of such is the kingdom of God. - Prophet Jesus</em></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Summer is a time when children fly kites high in the air&#150;kites of all
  different shapes, sizes and colours. Summer is a time when kids spend lazy hours by ponds
  watching ducks and geese float merrily along lethargic lakes set against a background of
  manicured rolling lawns. Summer is a time when children play soccer on fields of green. It
  is a time when they ride their bicycles and sell Kool-ade at homemade stands. It is a time
  when they count the stars lacing cool summer evenings and a time when they dream of what
  their future might be.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Summer is a time when mothers take their infants out for a stroll on paved
  avenues. It is a time when infants stare wide-eyed in innocence at the world around them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Summer is a time when children bathe in the sea and build sandcastles on
  the beach. It is a celebration of life. It is in the summer when things take wing, gardens
  bear fruit and picnics abound.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">But such things occur in places where there is peace and where there is no
  war. In occupied Palestine, summer brings no special happiness for children. During the
  intifada, it is almost impossible to fly carefree kites. There are no ponds to watch ducks
  and geese floating merrily on. Water supplies are cut off from Palestinian cities and
  villages. Israeli soldiers shoot holes in water tanks on top of Palestinian homes to
  further exacerbate the critical water shortage. And fresh springs are filled with cement
  or polluted so that the people in the surrounding areas are not able to consume what
  little water there is.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">With no water, there are no Kool-ade stands and no chance for children to
  sell their wares to passers-by and no peaceful moments anyway even if there were pure and
  bountiful supplies of water.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">There is little opportunity for children to ride bicycles or scooters. And
  there is no time to stare at evening skies or count stars. Palestinian children are more
  preoccupied with merely staying alive.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">For those children brave enough to confront a heavily armed enemy who
  occupies their land, there are Israeli snipers who aim at infant hearts and heads in
  retaliation for a single stone. Many children who have miraculously survived bullets aimed
  at their hearts and heads will have to go through the rest of their lives as physically
  impaired people. Thousands of such Palestinian children will never walk again or see.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Some children caught throwing stones are arrested by Israeli soldiers and
  taken to prison. There they are severely beaten and tortured. Some children have died due
  to torture. No human being should be tortured but to subject a child to such inhuman
  treatment is the highest form of savagery. One report about how Israeli police torture
  these children included the following methods: forcing children to stand in painful
  positions for prolonged periods of time, beating minors severely for many hours and at
  times these beatings were carried out with the use of various objects, pushing
  children&#146;s heads into toilet bowls and flushing the toilet, making death threats and
  cursing and humiliating these children.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">A testimony from Mohammed Sabatin, a 14-year-old, states that four
  policemen took him, searched him and beat him in front of his parents. Then the boy saw a
  strong, dark-skinned man dressed in civilian clothes enter the room where Mohammed was
  being detained. The man kicked the boy with great force, beat him and then put him in a
  room where four policemen were seated. Two of these policemen tied the boy&#146;s hands
  and feet and blindfolded him and took him to a room with the blindfold still on. The four
  policemen took turns beating the boy for about 4 hours. They hit him with a mop stick,
  kicked him all over his body and swore at him in filthy language.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Just recently, a family travelling to a wedding ceremony was attacked by
  Jewish terrorists. Three people were shot to death that day, including a tiny baby boy
  only 3 months old. His mother, who was not in the car at the time of the attack, held up
  his bloody clothes and wept. She had been trying to have a child for 10 years. Her son,
  Diya, was her only child. Five people from the same family, including a four-month-old
  girl and a three-year-old girl were wounded.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, 20 July, infant Diya was wrapped in a tiny Palestinian flag and
  carried in a funeral procession along with his dead relatives through the West Bank city
  of Hebron to his home village, Ithna.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Baby Diya&#146;s aunt, a young bride of 17, contorted from pain in a
  hospital. She had been holding the infant on her lap when the terrorists attacked. Her leg
  was full of shrapnel, studded with metal rods and encased in a cast. No one had the
  courage to tell her that her husband, Mohammed Salameh Tmeizi who was also in the car had
  been killed and was being buried that day as well along with tiny Diya.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This war of aggression against the rightful owners of their land is
  barbaric. But what about the effect of all this war and death and pain on the children?
  What will happen to these children who have either been the victims of Israeli atrocities
  themselves or have been witnesses of others being victimized? How will these children grow
  up and how will they be able to cope with the nightmare of war?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Every child has the right to live in peace. Every child has the right to
  be safe from physical harm. Every child has the right to go to and from school without
  being shot at. Every child has the right to be a child. And no child should ever have to
  fight for the freedom of his or her people.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Children should be brought up in a healthy and safe environment. They
  should be treated with sympathy and consideration and their basic needs should be met.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The demolition of houses, the uprooting of trees, the destruction of
  farmland, the pollution or stoppage of water supplies are all things that children should
  not have to face. Children should not have to live in constant fear that they will be
  slaughtered regardless of whether they throw stones or not. And they should not have to
  witness the deaths of their relatives and loved ones.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The blood of these innocents stains all our hands, but the hands that it
  stains the most are Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, American President George Bush,
  and all the Arab leaders who are either drunk or might as well be because they seem to be
  completely oblivious to the Palestinian Holocaust that is going on right under their
  upturned noses.</p>

</font><em><small>David Goldman</small></em></h3>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" size="3">

<p></font>I write today as an Orthodox Jew with a broken heart. Perhaps it provides me
with just a taste of the pain of holy prophets such as Jeremiah and Isaiah who were voices
in the wilderness as so many around them ignored their calls to repentance. <br>
Needless to say, I am far from being a prophet or any kind of holy man, but my heart is
broken anyway, especially with a sense of powerlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.
My only<br>
consolation is that G-d is watching everything and will change everything in a heartbeat.<br>
My heart is broken to see the sacred honor of the Jewish Religion torn into shreds by the
wicked Zionist apostate criminals.<br>
My heart is broken to see the worst possible crimes being committed in the name of the
Jewish People and the Jewish Religion against our relatives, other descendants of Abraham,
the Palestinian People.<br>
My heart is broken to see the crimes, too numerous to express, committed by those Jews
whose Jewish souls have been transformed into souls of savages.<br>
My heart is broken to see so-called &quot;rabbis&quot; who are actually nothing more than
puppets for their non-religious Zionist paymasters speak the most vile lies in the name of
Judaism. <br>
They are not the spokesman for the Jewish People. They are wicked collaborators of the
Zionist regime.<br>
My heart is broken to behold how far so many of the Jewish People have fallen into Zionist
brainwashing and addiction, and how they have been cut off from the central spiritual core
of our religion, to the point where their behavior and speech is unrecognizable as
anything considered Jewish.<br>
My heart is broken to see the holiness of the Holy Land defiled by idolatry and bloodshed
in order to maintain the Idol known as the State of Israel.<br>
My heart is broken to behold the suffering of the Palestinian men, women and children
confined to Ghettos and subject to all other indignities and inhuman practices.<br>
My heart is broken that so many fellow-Jews cannot perceive the original cause of all the
problems of Palestine, and how easily they can all be repaired.<br>
My heart will only be repaired when the vile anti-semitic idolatrous regime of the Zionist
State is dismantled, and full rights of the Palestinians are restored in their own land,
including the return of all the refugees.<br>
My heart is broken by injustice, and will be repaired by justice.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Provide hope for freedom</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ismail Adam Patel*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The political world order and even the mass media would want us to believe
and more importantly accept that the crisis unfolding before us in Occupied Palestine is
simply a conflict between two groups of people. Even for the most superficial observer,
this spin is difficult to absorb. You do not need to be gifted with the brains of Imam
Ghazzali to discern that the conflict is simply not for territorial control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To state the obvious, Palestine is in the Middle East, an area that is the
richest in the greatest asset the world needs: oil! It is not only the natural resources
that are of value but even more important is the revenue of millions of petrol dollars it
generates. Coupled with the geographical location of the Middle East, it makes it
incumbent upon any nation wishing to dominate and impose its power in the world to be in
control of this area both economically and politically.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore the West (and by the West I primarily mean the U.S.), followed
by its barking bodyguard the UK and then the rest of Europe, saw the need not only to
control the oil fields but also to ensure the petrol dollars generated are channelled to
the West in order to maintain their supremacy. It has therefore been the preoccupation of
the hungry minds of the West since the turn of the last century, i.e. before the First
World War, to achieve the desired status quo.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To achieve their goal, the British government masterminded the collapse of
the Ottoman empire and subsequently drafted and then implemented their plan to prop up
regimes in the Middle East, which they called an &#147;Arab Façade&#148;; these are
regimes which would have an external &#147;Arab or Islamic&#148; façade acceptable to the
indigenous population but under ultimate British control. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But after the First WorldWar, the British colonialist power began to wane
and hence entered into the fray with the United States of America. The U.S. managed to
sideline France and even the Russians, who were party to the carving up of the Middle East
during the First World War, while maintaining the UK on board only because it accepted to
play second fiddle serving in the role as a U.S. attack dog.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This fantastic colonialist ideology for the Middle East, which worked for
a while, made one callous assumption: that the people will remain subservient to their
masters in the West at all times and forever. As there is always a party popper, so it was
in the Middle East, the Arab nationalists, and more recently the Islamists, have turned
the colonialist dream into a nightmare.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But to expect the West to abandon what has been and is lucrative and more
importantly supplying the colonialist West with &#147;power&#148; is impossible to give
away by the mere whims of some Arab nationalists or Islamists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the British colonialist system of the Arab façade was fading, the U.S.
began to search for a State or States called, &#147;local cops on the beat&#148; with the
headquarters in Washington.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel fit the bill to the tee, and according to the CIA, &#147;a logical
corollary of opposition to Arab nationalism would be to support Israel as the only
reliable pro-Western power in the Middle East.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Again, it does not take a rocket scientist to work out that Israel not
only allied with the U.S. but also became its military base.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s first medal of an accomplice was awarded when in 1967 it
destroyed the greatest Arab nationalist of the time, Nassar of Egypt. Nassar, according to
the U.S., was a &#147;virus&#148;, that is to say a virus of Arab nationalism that needed
eradicating before it spread. After the Israelis quelled Nassar, the U.S./Israel love
affair blossomed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It thus follows that the local cops on the beat were afforded privileges
by assisting to maintain U.S. hegemony. Those nations with an Arab Façade are also
allowed special compensations, but to a lesser degree than the local cops on the beat,
provided they at all times control their populace and channel its resources and also
revenue generated to the West. Even the UK benefits, very much like the little fishes that
swim along with the shark do, in so much as they get to pick up the crumbs provided they
maintain their service and hope the master does not get too hungry and maybe one day even
swallows them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Where do the Palestinians fit in the picture? Well, they simply
don&#146;t. They are a nuisance&#150;a group of people whose own society is divided in
various camps and crucially a populace that is detached from the desired individuals
imposed by the West. They have no natural resources and more importantly make
&#147;unreliable partners&#148; to serve the needs of the West. Palestinians are simply
bad cops for the beat and, come to think about it, irrelevant since the West already has
an obedient cop for the area. Under the circumstances some would even argue a low-level
intensity conflict in the Middle East between various neighbours and especially between
Palestine and Israel works in the favour of those holding and wishing to maintain the
balance of power.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore it should not surprise anybody that we have seen American F-16
jets with Israeli pilots bombing Palestinian-concentrated areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the battle arena is occupied Palestine, the deaths of
Palestinians caused by the fingers of Israelis on M16 guns or an Israeli pilot in an
Apache attack helicopter or F16 jet, we must remind ourselves the equipment and more
fundamentally the ability of Israel to act with impunity is the direct result of the U.S.
and to a lesser degree British governments acquiescence to Israeli actions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Israelis need not fool themselves that the West loves the
Zionist or even the Jew. If they only go back a few years in history, it was the very same
West that persecuted them and, to quote one example, in 1939 a ship called the St Louis
left Germany with 930 Jews, who had escaped the beginning of Nazi Germany persecutions,
with U.S. immigration permits; when the ship docked in the U.S., not a single Jew was
allowed to set foot on U.S. soil&#150;they were all forced to return. This is an example
of the &#147;West&#146;s banner for humanity.&#148; It was the same U.S. who in 1941
instead of making it easier for Jewish refugees to get in to the U.S. passed new
immigration laws making it almost impossible for Jews to immigrate, but at that time the
Jew had no credentials for a cop on the beat!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So where do those concerned with human rights, justice and equitable
treatment for fellow humans concentrate their efforts in order to alleviate the
oppressions suffered by the Palestinians?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We in the West need to kindle the lamp of hope; those who aspire for human
dignity, honour and freedom to live in peace need to employ both short- and long-term
strategies for the implementation of justice with peace in Palestine. Although, as we read
this, American and other Western countries&#146; equipment is being used to maim and kill
Palestinians, we need to germinate the mechanism for the truth of our countries&#146; role
in the genocide of Palestinians to permeate the masses. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The media&#146;s total jaundiced view needs to be challenged at every
occasion and questioned as to why they fail to mention newsworthy stories from Occupied
Palestine, which shows Israel in its true light. Concerned individuals could address this
dilemma by arranging talks, seminars, exhibitions and other events highlighting the
plight.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Becoming an ethical consumer may at an individual level appear
insignificant, but the united effect of the masses does not only hurt the profit margins
of targeted companies but much more importantly the public relations generated is worth
the effort as part of a tool in the strategy for hope and the solidarity factor in
visiting Palestine must not be abandoned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The long-term strategy of engaging the government into debate for the
improvement of human rights must be emphasized for a secure future for all. The ideology
of the need to climb a ladder of supremacy on other peoples&#146; backs must be made
counter-productive and hence the need to create cops for the beat or façades must be
eradicated, as was slavery. We may not be able to change the balance of power, but we can
work towards altering the political and ideological climate for a safer and peaceful
future for all in the Holy Land.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ruth Anderson</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>The police are here not to create disorder.</em></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>They are here to preserve disorder. -Richard J. Daley</em></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An Arab country</b> - It was late at night and for some reason I
couldn&#146;t sleep. Pictures flashing across my TV screen failed to impress me, so I took
a glass of soda and sat down near a window overlooking the large circle where I live. An
orange full moon hung there just above the housetops lending a feeling of calmness to the
quiet of the night. It seemed a good time to ponder over the day&#146;s events in the
solitude of the moment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">About half a block from my home, I noticed a policeman flagging down cars.
At first he looked as though he had positioned himself in the middle of the street so he
could pass out a few tickets but then it became obvious his patrol did not concern fining
drivers for minor offenses. Then just what was his mission?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When I was young growing up in America, I perceived the police force to be
the good guys who were out to get the villains and make certain that children like me
slept safe in their beds. But what I saw that night on the streets of an Arab capital not
far from my home deeply disturbed me.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The policeman holding a red flag stopped a yellow cab. After a few minutes
of discourse, he dragged out a young man and began to slap him around. The slaps were so
loud that I could clearly hear them from my fourth floor apartment. But it didn&#146;t
stop there. Two other policemen joined in and the three then began to savagely beat the
young man who was unable to defend himself. They threw him on the ground and kicked and
hit him with batons. Perhaps he cussed at them, perhaps he cursed them. I have no idea
what his &#147;crime&#148; was, but to me, this certainly wasn&#146;t any way to treat a
person. There are such things as police stations. The victim could have been taken to the
station and booked. Such a vicious beating was not at all necessary.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After they had exhausted themselves &#147;teaching&#148; their captive his
lesson, they tied him up like some kind of wild animal and threw him, bound hand and foot,
into the back seat of their police car. Every so often, they would throw open the back
door and beat him some more.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the flagged-down yellow cab stood still. The police officers
returned to the taxi and dragged out yet another young passenger. They commenced to slap
his face with heavy smacks that echoed through the otherwise still night air. Their second
victim, like the first, was thin, young and gaunt. But after the second smack, he broke
lose and took off down the street like a scared rabbit. It was almost comic to watch the
captive speed away and a not-so-fit policeman stumble after him. By now, I had stood up
and rushed to another window with a better view. When I saw the young guy escape, I threw
up my hands in support and shouted, &#147;Hooray&#148; though I knew no one could hear me.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By now a crowd of spectators had gathered around the policemen who were
furiously at work beating these teenagers. Some very obvious civilian spies were there
helping the police tame their prey and when the one youth escaped, the mukhabarat (Arab
CIAs) were off, too, scattering themselves in different directions to flush out their
hunt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All of a sudden, another yellow cab pulled up just at the edge of the
small mob that had gathered to witness police brutality. Out jumped a man and a lady,
presumably husband and wife, perhaps the parents of the wayward truant. Two police
returned to their car, flung open the back door and dragged out the bound and gagged
teenager. They stood him on his feet and again, smacked him so hard on his face and neck
that the sounds once more echoed through the late night air. Then they untied him, flagged
down another yellow cab, and man, woman and beaten youth all disappeared into the vehicle
and sped away to a saner destination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not too long afterwards, the crowd dispersed and the policemen, proud of
the work they had done and heavy with sweat, climbed into their police car and drove off
into the night.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why had the young men been stopped? Obviously they were not hardened
criminals or they would have been immediately carted off to prison. What minor crimes then
were these two teenagers guilty of? Had they merely challenged the authority of the police
who first stopped their cab? Had the cops retaliated to the smart remarks of the
adolescents by abusing the authority the government guaranteed all police?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whatever it was, the treatment of the young men proved many things to me.
It proved that there is no real system of justice. It proved that police are free to deal
with suspects in any manner they please. It proved that what I witnessed was the way every
suspect is treated except when harsher measures are employed. Such measures include severe
torture in order to extract confessions for those considered guilty of more serious
offenses. It proved that the concept of human rights is far from a reality and it proved
that this is how the law deals with anybody who defies authority. It proved that in Arab
countries every person is considered guilty until proven guilty. It proved that this is
how Arab governments plant fear in the hearts of their people and how such corrupt
governments ensure their own survival. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">What the Palestinians want: <br>
A more worried reply to our cousins</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Edna Yaghi</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s not as if anyone ever sat down with the Palestinians and asked
them what they want. For 53 years, it has always been what the Israelis want. It should
not be so difficult for the Israelis to understand that what the Palestinians want more
than anything else is freedom and the right to govern themselves on their own land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government has placed the entire Palestinian population in the
occupied territories under siege and every Palestinian, from newborn to elderly, is a
victim of collective punishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. was endorsed by both the Israeli
government and the Palestinian Authority end-June, Israel has done everything it can to
provoke the Palestinians into fighting back.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More than 24 Palestinians have died at Israeli checkpoints. Most of these
casualties were people seeking urgent medical attention. Recently a woman in labour was
refused passage from one Palestinian area to another even though the Israeli troops at the
checkpoint knew she was about to give birth. After her passage was refused, assisted by
her mother-in-law, the mother had her baby in the car. When the Israeli soldiers finally
granted the mother passage, it was too late for the newborn baby boy who died due to lack
of proper medical attention. By the time the mother and newborn arrived at their
destination, the mother was bleeding profusely and the baby was declared dead on arrival.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then there are the demolitions of Palestinian homes. Armoured Israeli
bulldozers and tanks rolled into Shufat, north of occupied Jerusalem, and also into Rafah,
south of the Gaza Strip, and demolished the homes of Palestinian families. More than 40
houses were destroyed while the occupants helplessly watched their homes reduced to
rubble. These people were not even allowed the time to retrieve their few meagre
possessions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is carrying out a campaign of terror by
purging the Palestinians from their land and homes, by assassinating freedom-fighters and
by killing little children on Palestinian streets and in their homes whether they are
throwing stones or not. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Little Mohammed al-Durra was one of the first child victims of the ongoing
crimes of war against the Palestinian people during the Intifada al-Aqsa. But now, every
day, new Mohammed al-Durras are killed by people who have no hearts and no consciences.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli soldiers aim at children and adults from the waist up in a
shoot-to-kill spree. It is open hunting season and Palestinians are the prey. No one is
safe from Israeli sharpshooters, no infant, no woman, no elderly person.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli tanks move in to shell Palestinian civilian areas and then Sharon
claims these actions are either for &#147;security&#148; or reprisals. Palestinian homes
are blown to pieces, shattered glass is strewn everywhere, water tanks are blasted to
smithereens and electricity is shut off not to mention the terror that little children
experience in the middle of the night when their homes are bombed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So the Palestinians grit their teeth and wait for a larger Israeli
offensive against them while Israeli citizens sit and scratch their heads in wonder asking
themselves, &#147;What in the world do those damn natives want?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With their cities under siege, water and food supplies cut off, untreated
sewage running in the gutters and garbage left to ferment, a shattered economy, children
dying in the streets, homes demolished, trees uprooted, the indigenous inhabitants of
their land are supposed to turn the other cheek and thank the Israelis for their
generosity in killing Palestinians?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While Palestinian blood flows in Palestinian streets in the name of
freedom, the freedom that is the inalienable right of all, Sharon nefariously plots
harsher measures to inflict on the occupied population. And all this time, backed by the
most heavily armed country in the Middle East, thanks to American taxpayers&#146; money,
Israel pretends that it is the victim of Palestinian terrorism and that Palestinians are
trying to throw the Israelis in the sea. Only a fool would believe such hogwash. It is the
Palestinians who are the victims of Israeli atrocities, and when the people who have lost
everything can stand no more, they strike back in any way they are able to.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that Americans care more if a point in Nasdaq evokes more
feelings than the death of another Palestinian baby. It is true that the Arab leaders are
greedy, selfish pigs who have sold their souls to the Devil. It is true that Sharon is out
to wage his own form of &#147;ethnic cleansing.&#148; What is the difference between him
and Milosevic?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But it is also true that the Palestinians will resist&#150;without
weapons, without help, without sympathy. The Holocaust is no longer Jewish. It is
Palestinian.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What I would like to ask Anat Gov and other Israelis who are offended by
the truth is, what do the Israelis really want? Would they be satisfied if they
slaughtered every Palestinian man, woman and child? Is it not enough what they have done
already? Is it not enough that they have taken away most of Palestine from its rightful
owners? Is it not enough that they take more than 85% of the Palestinian water resources?
And while Palestinians don&#146;t even have water to drink, Israelis bask by the side of
their pools oblivious to all the pain, suffering and injustice that rages right outside
their doors. Is it not enough that Palestinians must fall by the dozens every day in order
to satiate the appetite of bloodthirsty people like Sharon? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But I say unto you, that the sleeping elephant will one day awaken and
then beware. The tables just might be turned and then you&#150;Gov, et. al&#150;can sit
and scratch your heads once more in bewilderment. That is, if your heads are still intact.</p>

German support for Zionism was not unlimited. Government and Party officials were very
mindful of the continuing campaign by powerful Jewish communities in the United States,
Britain and other countries to mobilize &#147;their&#148; governments and fellow citizens
against Germany. As long as world Jewry remained implacably hostile toward National
Socialist Germany, and as long as the great majority of Jews around the world showed
little eagerness to resettle in the Zionist &#147;promised land,&#148; a sovereign Jewish
State in Palestine would not really &#147;solve&#148; the international Jewish question.
Instead, German officials reasoned, it would immeasurably strengthen this dangerous
anti-German campaign. German backing for Zionism was therefore limited to support for a
Jewish homeland in Palestine under British control, not a sovereign Jewish State (23).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A Jewish State in Palestine, the Foreign Minister informed diplomats in
June 1937, would not be in Germany&#146;s interest because it would not be able to absorb
all Jews around the world, but would only serve as an additional power base for
international Jewry, in much the same way as Moscow served as a base for international
Communism (24). Reflecting something of a shift in official policy, the German press
expressed much greater sympathy in 1937 for Palestinian Arab resistance to Zionist
ambitions, at a time when tension and conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine was
sharply increasing (25).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A Foreign Office circular bulletin dated 22 June 1937, cautioned that in
spite of support for Jewish settlement in Palestine, &#147;it would nevertheless be a
mistake to assume that Germany supports the formation of a State structure in Palestine
under some form of Jewish control. In view of the anti-German agitation of international
Jewry, Germany cannot agree that the formation of a Palestine Jewish State would help the
peaceful development of the nations of the world (26).&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The proclamation of a Jewish State or a Jewish-administrated
Palestine,&#148; warned an internal memorandum by the Jewish affairs section of the SS,
&#147;would create for Germany a new enemy, one that would have a deep influence on
developments in the Near East.&#148; Another SS agency predicted that a Jewish State
&#147;would work to bring special minority protection to Jews in every country, therefore
giving legal protection to the exploitation activity of world Jewry (27).&#148; In January
1939, Hitler&#146;s new Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, likewise warned in
another circular bulletin that &#147;Germany must regard the formation of a Jewish State
as dangerous&#148; because it &#147;would bring an international increase in power to
world Jewry (28).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hitler himself personally reviewed this entire issue in early 1938 and, in
spite of his long-standing skepticism of Zionist ambitions and misgivings that his
policies might contribute to the formation of a Jewish State, decided to support Jewish
migration to Palestine even more vigorously. The prospect of ridding Germany of its Jews,
he concluded, outweighed the possible dangers (29).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the British government imposed ever more drastic restrictions
on Jewish immigration into Palestine in 1937, 1938 and 1939. In response, the SS security
service concluded a secret alliance with the clandestine Zionist agency Mossad le-Aliya
Bet to smuggle Jews illegally into Palestine. As a result of this intensive collaboration,
several convoys of ships succeeded in reaching Palestine past British gunboats. Jewish
migration, both legal and illegal, from Germany (including Austria) to Palestine increased
dramatically in 1938 and 1939. Another 10,000 Jews were scheduled to depart in October
1939, but the outbreak of war in September brought the effort to an end. All the same,
German authorities continued to promote indirect Jewish emigration to Palestine during
1940 and 1941 (30). Even as late as March 1942, at least one officially authorized Zionist
&#147;kibbutz&#148; training camp for potential emigrants continued to operate in
Hitler&#146;s Germany (31).</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Transfer Agreement</b></u><br>
The centrepiece of German-Zionist cooperation during the Hitler era was the Transfer
Agreement, a pact that enabled tens of thousands of German Jews to migrate to Palestine
with their wealth. The Agreement, also known as the Haavara (Hebrew for
&#147;transfer&#148;), was concluded in August 1933 following talks between German
officials and Chaim Arlosoroff, Political Secretary of the Jewish Agency, the Palestine
centre of the World Zionist Organization (32).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Through this unusual arrangement, each Jew bound for Palestine deposited
money in a special account in Germany. The money was used to purchase German-made
agricultural tools, building materials, pumps, fertilizer and so forth, which were
exported to Palestine and sold there by the Jewish-owned Haavara company in Tel Aviv.
Money from the sales was given to the Jewish emigrant upon his arrival in Palestine in an
amount corresponding to his deposit in Germany. German goods poured into Palestine through
the Haavara, which was supplemented a short time later with a barter agreement by which
Palestine oranges were exchanged for German timber, automobiles, agricultural machinery
and other goods. The Agreement thus served the Zionist aim of bringing Jewish settlers and
development capital to Palestine, while simultaneously serving the German goal of freeing
the country of an unwanted alien group.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Delegates at the 1933 Zionist Congress in Prague vigorously debated the
merits of the Agreement. Some feared that the pact would undermine the international
Jewish economic boycott against Germany. But Zionist officials reassured the Congress. Sam
Cohen, a key figure behind the Haavara arrangement, stressed that the Agreement was not
economically advantageous to Germany. Arthur Ruppin, a Zionist Organization emigration
specialist who had helped negotiate the pact, pointed out that &#147;the Transfer
Agreement in no way interfered with the boycott movement, since no new currency will flow
into Germany as a result of the agreement...(33)&#148; The 1935 Zionist Congress, meeting
in Switzerland, overwhelmingly endorsed the pact. In 1936, the Jewish Agency (the Zionist
&#147;shadow government&#148; in Palestine) took over direct control of the Haavara, which
remained in effect until the Second World War forced its abandonment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some German officials opposed the arrangement. Germany&#146;s Consul
General in Jerusalem, Hans D<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">ö</font>hle,
for example, sharply criticized the Agreement on several occasions during 1937. He pointed
out that it cost Germany the foreign exchange that the products exported to Palestine
through the pact would bring if sold elsewhere. The Haavara monopoly sale of German goods
to Palestine through a Jewish agency naturally angered German businessmen and Arabs there.
Official German support for Zionism could lead to a loss of German markets throughout the
Arab world. The British government also resented the arrangement (34). A June 1937 German
Foreign Office internal bulletin referred to the &#147;foreign exchange sacrifices&#148;
that resulted from the Haavara (35).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A December 1937 internal memorandum by the German Interior Ministry
reviewed the impact of the Transfer Agreement: &#147;There is no doubt that the Haavara
arrangement has contributed most significantly to the very rapid development of Palestine
since 1933. The Agreement provided not only the largest source of money (from Germany!),
but also the most intelligent group of immigrants, and finally it brought to the country
the machines and industrial products essential for development.&#148; The main advantage
of the pact, the memo reported, was the emigration of large numbers of Jews to Palestine,
the most desirable target country as far as Germany was concerned. But the paper also
noted the important drawbacks pointed out by Consul D<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">ö</font>hle and others. The Interior Minister,
it went on, had concluded that the disadvantages of the agreement now outweighed the
advantages and that, therefore, it should be terminated (36).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only one man could resolve the controversy. Hitler personally reviewed the
policy in July and September 1937, and again in January 1938, and each time decided to
maintain the Haavara arrangement. The goal of removing Jews from Germany, he concluded,
justified the drawbacks (37).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Reich Economics Ministry helped to organize another transfer company,
the International Trade and Investment Agency, or Intria, through which Jews in foreign
countries could help German Jews emigrate to Palestine. Almost $900,000 was eventually
channeled through the Intria to German Jews in Palestine (38). Other European countries
eager to encourage Jewish emigration concluded agreements with the Zionists modeled after
the Ha&#146;avara. In 1937, Poland authorized the Halifin (Hebrew for
&#147;exchange&#148;) transfer company. By late summer 1939, Czechoslovakia, Romania,
Hungary and Italy had signed similar arrangements. The outbreak of war in September 1939,
however, prevented large-scale implementation of these agreements (39).</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Achievements of Haavara</b></u><br>
Between 1933 and 1941, some 60,000 German Jews emigrated to Palestine through the Haavara
and other German-Zionist arrangements, or about 10% of Germany&#146;s 1933 Jewish
population. (These German Jews made up about 15% of Palestine&#146;s 1939 Jewish
population.) Some Haavara emigrants transferred considerable personal wealth from Germany
to Palestine. As Jewish historian Edwin Black has noted: &#147;Many of these people,
especially in the late 1930s, were allowed to transfer actual replicas of their homes and
factories&#150;indeed rough replicas of their very existence (4).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The total amount transferred from Germany to Palestine through the Haavara
between August 1933 and the end of 1939 was 8.1 million pounds or 139.57 million German
marks (then equivalent to more than $40 million). This amount included 33.9 million German
marks ($13.8 million) provided by the Reichsbank in connection with the Agreement (41).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Historian Black has estimated that an additional $70 million may have
flowed into Palestine through corollary German commercial agreements and special
international banking transactions. The German funds had a major impact on a country as
underdeveloped as Palestine was in the 1930s, he pointed out. Several major industrial
enterprises were built with the capital from Germany, including the Mekoroth waterworks
and the Lodzia textile firm. The influx of Haavara goods and capital, concluded Black,
&#147;produced an economic explosion in Jewish Palestine&#148; and was &#147;an
indispensable factor in the creation of the State of Israel (42).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haavara agreement greatly contributed to Jewish development in
Palestine and thus, indirectly, to the foundation of the Israeli State. A January 1939
German Foreign Office circular bulletin reported, with some misgivings, that &#147;the
transfer of Jewish property out of Germany [through the Haavara agreement] contributed to
no small extent to the building of a Jewish State in Palestine (43).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Former officials of the Haavara company in Palestine confirmed this view
in a detailed study of the Transfer Agreement published in 1972: &#147;The economic
activity made possible by the influx of German capital and the Haavara transfers to the
private and public sectors were of greatest importance for the country&#146;s development.
Many new industries and commercial enterprises were established in Jewish Palestine, and
numerous companies that are enormously important even today in the economy of the State of
Israel owe their existence to the Haavara (44).&#148; Dr. Ludwig Pinner, a Haavara company
official in Tel Aviv during the 1930s, later commented that the exceptionally competent
Haavara immigrants &#147;decisively contributed&#148; to the economic, social, cultural
and educational development of Palestine&#146;s Jewish community (45).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Transfer Agreement was the most far-reaching example of cooperation
between Hitler&#146;s Germany and international Zionism. Through this pact, Hitler&#146;s
Third Reich did more than any other government during the 1930s to support Jewish
development in Palestine.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionists Offer a Military Alliance With Hitler</b></u><br>
In early January 1941, a small but important Zionist organization submitted a formal
proposal to German diplomats in Beirut for a military-political alliance with wartime
Germany. The offer was made by the radical underground &#147;Fighters for the Freedom of
Israel,&#148; better known as the Lehi or Stern Gang. Its leader, Avraham Stern, had
recently broken with the radical nationalist &#147;National Military Organization&#148;
(Irgun Zvai Leumi) over the group&#146;s attitude toward Britain, which had effectively
banned further Jewish settlement of Palestine. Stern regarded Britain as the main enemy of
Zionism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This remarkable Zionist proposal &#147;for the solution of the Jewish
question in Europe and the active participation of the NMO [Lehi] in the war on the side
of Germany&#148; is worth quoting at some length (46):</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In their speeches and statements, the leading statesmen of National
Socialist Germany have often emphasized that a New Order in Europe requires as a
prerequisite a radical solution of the Jewish question by evacuation. (&#147;Jew-free
Europe&#148;)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The evacuation of the Jewish masses from Europe is a precondition
for solving the Jewish question. However, the only way this can be totally achieved is
through settlement of these masses in the homeland of the Jewish people, Palestine, and by
the establishment of a Jewish State in its historical boundaries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The goal of the political activity and the years of struggle by the
Israel Freedom Movement, the National Military Organization in Palestine (Irgun Zvai
Leumi), is to solve the Jewish problem in this way and thus completely liberate the Jewish
people forever.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The NMO, which is very familiar with the goodwill of the German
Reich government and its officials towards Zionist activities within Germany and the
Zionist emigration programme, takes the view that:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;1. Common interests can exist between a European New Order based on
the German concept and the true national aspirations of the Jewish people as embodied by
the NMO.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;2. Cooperation is possible between the New Germany and a renewed,
folkish-national Jewry [Hebr.ertum].</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;3. The establishment of the historical Jewish State on a national
and totalitarian basis, and bound by treaty with the German Reich, would be in the
interest of maintaining and strengthening the future German position of power in the Near
East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;On the basis of these considerations, and upon the condition that
the German Reich government recognizes the national aspirations of the Israel Freedom
Movement mentioned above, the NMO in Palestine offers to actively take part in the war on
the side of Germany.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This offer by the NMO could include military, political and informational
activity within Palestine and, after certain organizational measures, outside as well.
Along with this the Jewish men of Europe would be militarily trained and organized in
military units under the leadership and command of the NMO. They would take part in combat
operations for the purpose of conquering Palestine, should such a front be formed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The indirect participation of the Israel Freedom Movement in the New Order
of Europe, already in the preparatory stage, combined with a positive-radical solution of
the European Jewish problem on the basis of the national aspirations of the Jewish people
mentioned above, would greatly strengthen the moral foundation of the New Order in the
eyes of all humanity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The cooperation of the Israel Freedom Movement would also be consistent
with a recent speech by the German Reich Chancellor, in which Hitler stressed that he
would utilize any combination and coalition in order to isolate and defeat England.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no record of any German response. Acceptance was very unlikely
anyway because by this time German policy was decisively pro-Arab (47). Remarkably,
Stern&#146;s group sought to conclude a pact with the Third Reich at a time when stories
that Hitler was bent on exterminating Jews were already in wide circulation. Stern
apparently either did not believe the stories or he was willing to collaborate with the
mortal enemy of his people to help bring about a Jewish State (48). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An important Lehi member at the time the group made this offer was Yitzhak
Shamir, who later served as Israel&#146;s Foreign Minister and then, during much of the
1980s and until June 1992, as Prime Minister. As Lehi operations chief following
Stern&#146;s death in 1942, Shamir organized numerous acts of terror, including the
November 1944 assassination of British Middle East Minister Lord Moyne and the September
1948 slaying of Swedish United Nations mediator Count Bernadotte. Years later, when Shamir
was asked about the 1941 offer, he confirmed that he was aware of his organization&#146;s
proposed alliance with wartime Germany (49).</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Conclusion<br>
</b></u>In spite of the basic hostility between the Hitler regime and international Jewry,
for several years Jewish Zionist and German National Socialist interests coincided. In
collaborating with the Zionists for a mutually desirable and humane solution to a complex
problem, the Third Reich was willing to make foreign exchange sacrifices, impair relations
with Britain and anger the Arabs. Indeed, during the 1930s no nation did more to
substantively further Jewish-Zionist goals than Hitler&#146;s Germany.</p>

State. Referring to the majority Arab population there, the Declaration went on to

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Samah Jabr*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My brother, Basheer, woke early at 6 a.m. He walked out onto our veranda
and looked around our neighbourhood of stucco apartments knitting courtyard to courtyard,
winding down a hillside to the court where the sound of children&#146;s voices already
filled the air. He covertly lit a cigarette. He chose not to look out at the dusty morning
light; instead, he faced the door to our kitchen. I broke his solitude. &#147;Up so
early,&#148; I chided Basheer as I came onto the veranda smiling and excited. This was
Basheer&#146;s graduation day. Basheer smiled and put out his cigarette. &#147;Better not
let Mom catch me with this,&#148; he said. I laughed and went over to give my only brother
a hug. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;You are happy, right?&#148; I asked. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Yes,&#148; Basheer answered. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today was the climax or the beginning, depending on how you look at it, of
the family&#146;s ambition for this son among daughters. In a few hours, we would travel
with him to Birzeit University where he would graduate with a bachelor&#146;s degree in
civil engineering. Basheer had been reveling in his success, his imaginative mind
seemingly fixed on the complexity of road-building, concrete-stress testing, water and
irrigation systems. All lectures attended and finished, all exams passed, all grades
recorded, Basheer was about to graduate. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gone, for the moment at least, was his preoccupation with cooking.
&#147;Are you sorry you listened to the family and went into engineering instead of
becoming a chef?&#148; I asked, concerned that pressure from others would leave him
unsatisfied. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basheer didn&#146;t answer directly. He said, &#147;Today is the second
most important day in a man&#146;s life. Today, I say goodbye to school and hello to the
world. Next comes the most important day, the day I marry. I better make myself look good,
because the pictures taken today will tell who I qualify to attract tomorrow.&#148; He
beamed at me. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before I could respond, the nephews, who live in our family compound,
appeared pushing their way toward their hero. Basheer caught the first to reach him.
&#147;Up you go,&#148; he said lifting the four-year-old over his head. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I have a surprise for you.&#148; Basheer vanished into the house and
returned with his black cap and gown. Without a word, he dressed little Suhaib in his
graduation gown. Next, he plunked his tasseled cap on the head of five-year-old Hamada. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There,&#148; he said, &#147;You two are the graduates. Here, let me
take your pictures. Then, everyone will think we have geniuses in our family. You
won&#146;t even have to go to school,&#148; he teased. &#147;We&#146;ll prove that
you&#146;ve already graduated.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At noon, Basheer ironed his gown himself, allowing no one to assist him.
Then, he disappeared. It seemed hours before he returned, but when he did, he was a new
Basheer: his hair slick with lotion, his face perfectly shaved, donned in his graduation
gift&#150;a new suit, elegant with maroon tie and dress shoes. My mother and father, the
nephews, all of us stood in adoring attention, all smiles. We were aglow. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Birzeit University&#146;s white stone buildings almost glittered as we
made our way up a steep hill to the campus. The buildings seemed to radiate the pride we
felt. Once in the auditorium, all the participants I could see from my seat were just as
gratified as we were. I surmised that the happiness I saw all around me was a reprieve
from, even a negation of, the power of occupation. A friend is always telling me that
happiness is good. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At Birzeit University amid the reality of success, I understood what she
meant. This was not hedonistic hilarity some equate with pleasure; this was head-held-high
achievement. This was mindful happiness that can only come when one has gone beyond all
expectations, reduced all detriments to mindless rubble and made it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basheer&#146;s graduating class is the 26th group to pass beyond the
portals of Birzeit University, the first and most prestigious of the 12 major institutions
of higher education established in the Israeli-named Occupied Territories, our Palestine.
Graduations have been held at Birzeit since 1976 in spite of Israel&#146;s continuous
harassment including closing the institution as much as 60% of the time in the 1980s and
1990s. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like the students who attend the University, Birzeit&#146;s very survival
attests to the indomitable will of our people. For 19 of the university&#146;s 49-year
existence, Birzeit&#146;s President, founder and native of the area, Dr. Hanna Nasir, a
graduate of Perdue University in the United States, lived in exile. Those who work in
university administration in the U.S. would be in awe of the cooperative effort faculty
and administrators maintained to keep Birzeit up and running throughout the intifada, Dr.
Nasir&#146;s banishment, and the deaths of students who cared more about their country
than their own lives or were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the daughter of an academician, I know that administrators everywhere
must handle in-house politics. Imagine having to deal with all the standard complaints and
problems of a university coupled with managing an opposition government&#146;s imposed
curricular restrictions, curfews that interrupt and destroy class time, no money to pay
faculty and staff, air raids, Israeli Defense Forces, ditches dug to hamper coming and
going, and endless checkpoint harassment of students and faculty alike. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Truant officers in the U.S. who chase down wayward youths hiding from the
education mandated by their government would marvel at Palestinian students&#146; efforts
to get to school on the West Bank and Gaza. This is especially true at Birzeit where the
Israeli government often focuses its most ruthless offensives. It&#146;s nothing for
students who live less than 5 miles from the campus to travel over fields and through
people&#146;s yards taking hours instead of minutes to arrive at their destination.
Nowadays, Birzeit has to shut down at 2 p.m. because students and faculty must arrive home
by dark or risk being shot&#150;trespassers on their own land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In America, those who have not been to a war-torn country like ours have a
hard time imagining what academic life here is like. Having lived with an American faculty
family, I can imagine professors waking up early in the morning, eager to get to the
university for some &#147;contemplation time&#148; before students arrive for their
morning classes, driving out of the driveway only to find that all the roads leading to
and from their homes have been blocked with mountains of dirt or ditches. For us, such
roadblocks are frequent compliments of Israeli paranoia about security. It&#146;s no
wonder that the physical stamina of many Palestinian educators would put their American
colleagues to shame. Our mentors have few state-of-the-art gymnasiums, but they know how
to walk and walk fast. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My student friends, even in places as near as Tel Aviv, would have a hard
time believing the frustration of being a student on the West Bank. Imagine studying for
weeks, getting up early to arrive in time for one last review before a final exam and
having to miss it, and maybe a whole semester of work, because a checkpoint guard decides
that &#147;this kid is not going to get through today&#148; and that&#146;s it. To
graduate from Birzeit means that you not only have to master the material and pass the
tests, but you must risk your life simply to get there and to get home at the end of the
day&#150;everyday of every term of every year. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are no gentleman&#146;s &#147;C&#146;s&#148; at Birzeit, let alone
an easy &#147;A.&#148; Very few Palestinian students have ever heard of American
university grade inflation, a surprise to me when I studied in America. One parent told
me, &#147;If I have to pay $30,000 a year for Tommy to go to college, that college just
better get him through and get him ready for graduate school.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another person told me, &#147;In the future, a bachelor&#146;s degree will
not be sufficient for the information age. Everyone will need an advanced degree. We have
to be sure our students make the grade so they can get into good graduate
programmes.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At Birzeit, even if you&#146;ve had nothing but an exhausting struggle to
get to school and to get home every day for four years, you&#146;ve still got to meet
stiff academic requirements or you don&#146;t graduate. Missing a class because an Israeli
checkpoint guard hit you on the head with his gun butt is no excuse for not having read
the lesson of the day. Having studied abroad and here, I&#146;m amazed at the hard
standards required of us. Through tough academic standards our teachers inadvertently
teach us to cope with the life Israelis impose on us. No matter how hard the subject, no
matter how long it takes us to graduate, we Palestinian students leave the university
knowing that we have what it takes to succeed in spite of occupation. Getting into Birzeit
is like getting into an Ivy League school in the U.S. and once in, a student is on the
Palestinian fast track, even if that track seems like a plodders path rather than a race
track. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basheer has a number of friends who came to Birzeit from Gaza, less than
50 miles from the campus. These students cannot invite their families to see them perform
in a play, tour the campus or help them move into a dorm or apartment. Why? Most Gazans
are not allowed to enter the West Bank. Students can rarely, if ever, go home at holiday
times. Everyone knows that it&#146;s a privilege to be at Birzeit. They give up so much
for the honour. Going home becomes a dream. Home may be only 50 miles by road; for Gazans,
it is thousands of miles by Israeli rules.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Basheer passes down the aisle on the way to receive his certificate, he
glances over at his family and winks. He gives us a thumbs-up. As he does, I notice
television cameras, more than those usually present. What&#146;s this, I wonder, Israeli
surveillance, even at graduation? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ceremony ends with a graduate hat toss and families rush to hug their
graduates and take the obligatory photos. &#147;What&#146;s with the cameras?&#148; I ask
Basheer. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Oh, that,&#148; he answers nonchalantly. &#147;That&#146;s so the
families in Gaza can see the graduation in their camps.&#148; He sees a friend and turns
away to shake hands and offer congratulations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So the families in Gaza can see their children&#146;s graduation, I say to
myself, imagining the pride and the joy that will chase away this particular dreary day in
a refugee camp, made more like a prison by Israel&#146;s determination to destroy us.
Cramped and unsanitary, the Gazan camps represent occupation of the already occupied. I
imagine the pain of the families who could not come to be with their students on this
special day. I know the frustration of the students. Still, Birzeit thought of a way to
make things better through closed-circuit television. And the Israelis think they can
bring us to our knees. I smile to myself and feel a rush of joy. I understand happiness
even in this time of catastrophe. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Media coverage of the Intifada&#150;the logic of
power</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Nasser Ali Khasawneh*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was watching an episode of &#147;Diplomatic License&#148; on CNN. It was
hosting one of those supposedly fair and evenhanded discussions on the Palestinian
uprising (the &#147;intifada&#148;). Of course, each side was represented: on the right
corner, you had the two debating champs representing the Israeli point of view, one of
whom is the editor of one of the leading &#147;current affairs&#148; magazines in the
U.S., and the other the head of one of the myriad of Israeli lobbies. And for the
Palestinian side, you had two protagonists (how admirably neutral of CNN): one was a
spokesman for an Islamic organization that is as famous in the United States as the author
of this article, and another who heads a Jerusalem Studies Centre that must have been
established on the day on which &#147;Diplomatic License&#148; was recorded! And so the
debate raged on and on. Richard Roth, the programme&#146;s presenter and debate arbitrator
par excellence, presided over the proceedings and portrayed an image of utmost
impartiality. Equal time was given to each side to air its views, Richard acted
graciously, both sides raised their issues, and the programme concluded with a quote from
Kofi Annan&#146;s speech before the recent Arab Summit in Amman. Kofi Annan, god bless
him, was, of course, a picture of justice and righteousness. His quote had something for
both sides&#150;yes, the Arabs had every right to be miffed by the continued occupation of
Palestinian territories, but Israelis had a right to worry about their security. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other side of the world, on the same day, Slobodan Milosevic was
being arrested. In the news programmes and the hastily arranged debate shows on CNN, BBC
World and all other major Western news media, the storyline was simple. It was
fairytale-esque. It was a good day for Serbia and all those who believe in freedom and
basic human rights. The &#147;Butcher of Belgrade,&#148; the &#147;dictator,&#148; the
&#147;war criminal&#148; was being arrested&#150;let the world rejoice! During that
day&#146;s coverage and on subsequent days, those news media organizations were not
obsessed with the need to seem impartial vis-à-vis Slobo and his band of buddies in
Belgrade. The analysts who appeared on our screens were congratulating the Serbian
authorities and the world on the great news, and talked mostly logistics&#150;will Slobo
live it out in a Belgrade jail or will he eventually be given over to the War Crimes
Tribunal in the Hague. And I see nothing wrong with that. A man who is a war criminal has
been arrested, and in times like these, when all reasonable persons can agree on what the
parameters of basic justice are, there is no need to be as obsessive as usual about
impartiality. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And that&#146;s when I realized why people in Europe and the U.S. never
really supported Palestinian rights. Since the existence of Israel, Western media has
presented the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as a struggle of equals fighting it out in the
name of colliding causes that are at best vague and at worst indecipherable to the average
viewer. Whenever there&#146;s a crisis in the seemingly endless saga that is the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, analysts from both sides are woken from their sleep and
dragged into our TV sets to champion their side of the great divide. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What&#146;s wrong with that? Am I actually denouncing impartiality? Of
course not! Fair reporting and neutral coverage of events are the hallmarks of a free
society in which the press is not restricted by government propaganda. But even in the
fairest and most neutral of media outlets, a certain practice, let&#146;s call it a human
practice, has evolved over the years: YES, you should be evenhanded with almost all issues
in the world. BUT, there are certain issues on which all average human beings can agree
that there is one side that is clearly the aggressor, the undoubted violator of the other
party&#146;s rights. And in such cases, it is only natural, and acceptable to the average
viewer, that the media need not be fanatic about equal airtime to both sides of the
argument. It&#146;s OK to show some human bias. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are a multitude of cases in point: the anti-Apartheid struggle in
South Africa, the genocide in Rawanda, the democratic movement&#146;s struggle against
dictatorship in Eastern Europe, Kosovars&#146; pursuit of basic human rights,
Kuwait&#146;s resistance to Iraqi occupation, etc. In these cases, even the most
respectable of media institutions allow themselves a good deal of partiality. When
reporting on the fact that thousands of people were either massacred or detained in
Kosovo, it was naturally OK for CNN and its viewers if each report was not immediately
followed by an equally compelling piece about how Milosevic&#146;s gangs were actually in
the right and sadly misunderstood by the world! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The common thread running through all of these cases is that of moral
certainty. Of course, we can engage in philosophical discussions and argue that there is
no such thing as an absolute truth. But let&#146;s just say that there are a few issues on
which the great majority of human beings can agree on what&#146;s right and what&#146;s
blatantly wrong. In the South African case, there was a moral as certain and absolute as
we are ever going to get: it is wrong for a State to be constituted and run on the basis
of racial segregation. In the Kuwait example, all reasonable human beings could agree that
the forceful invasion of an entire country is not a reasonable way of settling a slight
border dispute. The list goes on and on until we get to the most obvious example facing
the world today: the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the ongoing intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are a number of inalienable truths about this conflict that should
not be obfuscated by any respectable media organization. First, there is the fact of
forced evacuation and ethnic cleansing. The armed groups that created the Jewish State in
1948 precipitated the forced exodus of over 750,000 Palestinians. Israel has refused to
allow the return of those refugees, who are now estimated to number 1.5 million. There is
a moral certainty that those who are kicked out of their homes and lands have an
indisputable right of return. Any argument to the contrary is at best morally bankrupt
and, at worst, downright sinister. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Secondly, the State of Israel is founded on the notion of religious
superiority. Any Jewish person wherever he or she may be living at present and regardless
of his or her specific history or national heritage has a right to immediate citizenship
in the State of Israel, in effect a right to supplant the local Arab population that has
been there since time immemorial. The argument is sometimes formulated on the lines that
Jews originally lived in the land of Palestine and were forcibly evacuated there thousands
of years ago, hence, every Jew can now return to his or her original home. Well,
let&#146;s leave for now the obvious point that if this were true, then the same logic
would apply more strikingly to all the Palestinians who have been forced to leave their
homes by the returning Jews only 53 years ago. In fact, some of those Palestinians still
have the keys to their houses! But let&#146;s just look at this argument in the context of
the world we live in. Imagine if every country in the world granted immediate citizenship
to anyone who claims that his ancestors used to live there hundreds or thousands of years
ago. The world would be surely thrown into chaos. Spain would have to grant citizenship to
all Arabs on the basis of the fact that Arabs lived and ruled in Andalusia for hundreds of
years before being kicked out five centuries ago; all Americans of non-Indian origin would
have to evacuate the USA forthwith. The potential list of absurdities that would proceed
from this warped logic is endless. In fact, the logic of citizenship in Israel can only be
comprehended if one accepts that Judaism is a superior form of religion. According to the
rules of this religion, the land of Palestine belongs to the Jews. This religious
commandment overrides all other national, religious and historical claims that any other
group of people may have over Palestine&#150;that&#146;s the only way in which one can
accept that Jews have an exclusive right to this land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thirdly, there is the fact of the illegal occupation of Arab lands in
1967. This is so indisputable even the United States has never questioned the United
Nations&#146; resolutions calling for Israel&#146;s immediate withdrawal from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and the right of self-determination for the Palestinians living in
those territories. Fourthly, there are the means and methods used by Israel to perpetuate
its illegal occupation of these Arab territories. I would argue that no people in history
have ever suffered under occupation as much as the Palestinians. Examples of Israeli State
terrorism can be seen on our TV screens on any given day; soldiers in tanks throwing bombs
in response to helpless stones thrown by an oppressed population living under occupation;
soldiers ganging up on detainees, breaking their bones with the back-ends of their rifles;
children shot intentionally in the head; and, last but not least, the demolition of houses
in order to expand illegal settlements or to teach the innocent family of a suspected
freedom fighter a lesson. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And these are just some of the basic facts about this conflict. And
that&#146;s without getting into some other current issues regarding which most Western
media outlets evince a shameful ambivalence. For example, take Ariel Sharon, the current
Prime Minister of Israel. Ariel Sharon is a war criminal. He is directly responsible,
amongst other ignominious things, for the murder of at least 1,000 innocent people in the
Sabra and Shatila camps during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. And that&#146;s
not just according to some Arab or international sources; the Kahan Commission, formed by
the Israeli Government to investigate the Sabra and Shatila massacres, reached the
conclusion that Sharon bore &#147;personal responsibility&#148; for the atrocities, and
requested the then-Prime Minister of Israel to fire Sharon from his government post. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, despite all of the above, most Western media institutions refuse to
place the Palestinian conflict in the human and moral context in which it belongs, the
same context in which they gladly place cases such as the anti-Apartheid struggle and the
Milosevic-induced massacres in the Balkans. Well, it&#146;s not for want of moral
justification. It is simply a case of the media reflecting the balance of power in our
times. Israel, for a multitude of reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, is
the favourite child of the United States, the world&#146;s greatest power. Consequently,
the world is subjected by and large to a Western media spin on the conflict that reflects
the policy of this age&#146;s Roman Empire and its main allies. In the same breath, we are
told that Mandela is a hero, yet the 13-year-old boy who braves the tanks and gun-fire in
Ramallah to throw a defiant stone in the face of aggression is just part of a &#147;cycle
of violence&#148; or, even worse, an innocent boy manipulated by his parents to go and die
for a vague cause. The sense of outrage at this ridiculous degradation of a struggle for
freedom cannot be overstated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In that CNN programme mentioned above, Richard Roth ended the neutral
segment on the conflict by praising the neutral Kofi Annan for being the only one in the
Arab Summit to see the &#147;Big Picture.&#148; I plead with those reading this article to
keep their eye on the big picture despite all the half-truths, contrived impartiality,
hazy commentaries and downright manipulation that cloud almost all coverage of the
intifada in Western media. The storyline is simpler here than in the most basic story you
read to your children at night. There are people in the Middle East who are currently
being denied the right to return to their homes, whose land is occupied in defiance of all
international laws, who lost the right of citizenship in their own homeland because they
don&#146;t belong to the right religion, whose houses are being demolished, whose bodies
are being shattered by the bullets of occupation and arrogance. Let the newscasters and
commentators strike their pose of fake evenhandedness in line with the present power
balance, but please make sure that you as an intelligent observer stand on the right side
of history. Empires and their propaganda machines come and go; the ideals of freedom and
justice are eternal. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">When Israelis are the victims, the media <br>
suddenly finds a conscience</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ray Hanania*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I expected to wake up to read the headline, &#147;Jewish terrorists murder
Arabs.&#148; But, of course, that was not to be. Members of Israel&#146;s fanatic settler
movement killed three Palestinian civilians on 19 July, including a 3-and-1/2-month-old
baby boy, Diya. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly, the news media finds a conscience. They start using phrases like
&#147;Israeli underground&#148; or &#147;settler vigilantes,&#148; instead of the much
harsher terms used to describe similar acts by Palestinians which include &#147;barbaric
terrorists&#148; and &#147;bloodthirsty Arab killers.&#148; One headline reported that a
&#147;blast&#148; kills Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conflict between Palestine and Israel has a lot to do with the way the
American news media covers the events. Certain headlines and adjectives describing the
attackers play a significant role in how the public responds, and how the political
theatre acts itself out. And those perceptions result in assessing blame. Most people
&#147;blame&#148; the Palestinians for the violence, accepting the Israeli contention that
former Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave the Palestinians everything&#150;including
Jerusalem&#150;and they opted instead toward violence &#147;to get even more from
Israel.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is not told until nearly a year later is that Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat demanded that the Israeli proposal also include compassion for the millions
of Palestinian civilians who were forced out of their homes and off their land in 1948 and
again in 1967. Arafat demanded that these refugees be given a &#147;right of return&#148;
that included a variety of options, one of which being that only a small percentage be
allowed to actually return to their original homes and land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, my family&#146;s homes and lands are occupied by Jewish immigrants
who took them during the 1948 war. Part of this land is today the settlement of Gilo near
Jerusalem. This disparity in truth sets up Israel in the enviable position of not only
having done its part, but suddenly, it is the victim of irrational behaviour on the part
of the Palestinians. Therefore, the Israelis can do no wrong. The Israelis can kill nearly
600 Palestinian civilians and the news media and the world shrugs it off as a consequence
of the Palestinians having refused Barak&#146;s peace offer. In contrast, about 100
Israelis are killed, most of whom are professional soldiers trained to face war. Every
attack is treated like it is the 1972 massacre at the Olympics. The truth is that Israel
is provoking the violence, but most American journalists are afraid to report that simple
truth. Journalists, especially in the West, function under the pressure of peer
censorship, while many in the Arab world function under an environment of government
censorship and limitations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am not sure which is worse, but I do know that both are wrong. American
journalists are always quick to point out the limitations on Arab journalists by their
governments as a way of responding to charges that the Western media is biased against the
Arabs. But the truth is that American journalists in particular operate under a cloud of
pressure that prohibits them from reporting the truth about Israel. This bias is inherent
in the professional news media structure and is absorbed by the reporters who don&#146;t
want to be criticized by the pro-Israeli editors and publishers who manage these media
operations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The news media also goes to great lengths to dissect Israeli actions to
the point of anti-Arab precision. There are two kinds of Israeli attacks: one involves
Israeli soldiers who are sent to oppress the Palestinian civilians. All attacks are
considered &#147;defensive&#148; and therefore &#147;justified.&#148; The presence of
Israeli soldiers in Arab areas is the primary cause of the current violence and the
provocation that pushes many frustrated and desperate Palestinian civilians to acts of
violence of their own. The second is the kind involving the fanatic settler movement.
Israeli settlers are among the worst fanatics in the world, even though the media seems
consumed only with the so-called &#147;Islamic fanatic.&#148; These Israeli settlers have
been engaged in a hate-war against the Palestinians with the goal of killing Arabs and
stealing their lands. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They have been doing it since the founding of the State of Israel, and
they have culled this campaign of hate into a fine art. Arab acts of rebellion against the
occupation fall under the term &#147;intifada&#148; and involve everything. Every act of
Arab resistance that results in an Israeli death, injury or simple assault is described as
an act of &#147;terrorism.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We all want the conflict to come to a peaceful resolution. But we will not
get there if we allow the news media to distort the truth, downplay the crimes of Israel,
and deny the Palestinians the compassion and understanding they deserve. </p>

          It may be that had more Israeli Jews paid attention and heeded the words of Katz the
          murder of Yitzhak Rabin would have been averted. In the view of this book's authors, the
          important difference between the real shock caused by Rabin's murder and the lack of shock
          caused by Goldstein's massacre lies in the fact that Goldstein's victims were non-Jews.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Although less direct than Katz, many other commentators in the Israeli
  Hebrew press have focused upon that part of the Israeli Jewish public who were shocked by
  the rejoicing over the massacre of innocent people and disturbed by the apologia offered
  by many politicians and public figures. Some of those people who were shocked described
  the backers of and apologists for Goldstein as &quot;Nazis&quot; or &quot;Nazi-like.&quot;
  These same people, who can be considered moderate hawks rather than Zionist doves, had
  before the massacre reacted negatively to the use by a few Israeli Jewish critics of such
  terminology in describing a part of the Israeli Jewish population. These &quot;moderate
  hawks&quot; had habitually labelled many Arab organizations, such as the Abu Nidal group
  and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, &quot;Nazi&quot; or
  &quot;Nazi-like.&quot; They did not repudiate their views about these Arab organizations;
  they merely concluded that some Jewish individuals and organizations also merit being so
  labelled on equal terms with some Arabs. The prestigious journalist, Teddy Preuss,
  reflected upon all of this in a most severe but substantially representative manner in his
  March 4, 1994 Davar article:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Compared to the giant-scale mass murderers of Auschwitz, Goldstein was
    certainly a petty murderer. His recorded statements and those of his comrades, however,
    prove that they were perfectly willing to exterminate at least two million Palestinians at
    an opportune moment. This makes Dr Goldstein comparable to Dr Mengele; the same holds true
    for anyone saying that he [or she] would welcome more of such Purim holiday celebrations.
    [The massacre occurred on that holiday.] Let us not devalue Goldstein by comparing him
    with an inquisitor or a Muslim Jihad fighter. Whenever an infidel was ready to convert to
    either Christianity or Islam, an inquisitor or Muslim Jihad fighter would, as a rule,
    spare his life. Goldstein and his admirers are not interested in converting Arabs to
    Judaism. As their statements abundantly testify, they see the Arabs as nothing more than
    disease-spreading rats, lice or other loathsome creatures; this is exactly how the Nazis
    believed that the Aryan race alone had laudable qualities that were inheritable but that
    could become polluted by sheer contact with dirty and morbid Jews. Kahane, who learned
    nothing from the Nuremberg Laws, had exactly the same notions about the Arabs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Really, Kahane had the same notions about non-Jews. Although less scathing
  than Preuss, other Israeli commentators suggested the same consideration.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In contrast to the above criticism were the even more numerous comments
  about the harm caused to Israeli Jews by the Goldstein massacre. The lament in the
  February 28, 1994 Haaretz Economic Supplement, for example, was headlined:
  &quot;Goldstein's massacre caused distress on the Tel-Aviv stock market.&quot; Other
  papers voiced similar sentiments. More importantly, Shimon Peres and other senior dovish
  politicians presented a typical political apologia in their criticism of the massacre,
  which they delivered in a meeting of the Knesset Committee for Foreign and Defense
  Affairs, Specific detail of this meeting is included below to illustrate the real opinions
  of most Israeli politicians and their general disregard of a major massacre of non-Jews
  except as it affected the interests of Israel and its allies. A March 8, 1994 Haaretz
  article reported the discussion at this meeting. Peres wasted no time expressing heartfelt
  shock about the murdered Palestinians but spoke instead about the harm to Israel caused by
  the &quot;pictures of corpses that the entire world could watch.&quot; Peres did not
  condemn the armed religious settlers for their public rejoicing and shooting; he deplored
  the harm caused to Israel and to themselves by the pictures of them. As quoted in Haaretz,
  Peres added: &quot;The events in Hebron also adversely affected the interests of President
  Mubarak and King Hussein, and even more of the PLO and its leadership.&quot; Peres then
  went on to say: &quot;We have had Jewish Kibbutzim located in the midst of Arabinhabited
  areas for 80 years, and I cannot recall a single instance of such a slaughter nor of
  firing at Arab buses nor of maiming Arab mayors.&quot; At this point in the discussion
  senior Likud politicians interpolated Peres. As reported in Haaretz:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The first to interrupt Peres' speech was Sharon. &quot;Kibbutzim are dear
    to me no less than to you, but there have been many cases when somebody from a kibbutz
    would go out to murder Arabs.&quot; Peres answered: &quot;The two cases are not
    comparable, because in the case under discussion the murderer was supported by a whole
    group of followers.&quot; Benny Begin [answered]: &quot;Why are you always talking in
    generalities?&quot; Peres [responded]: &quot;I am not. I only maintain that in order to
    pursue the peace process we need the PLO as a partner, and now this partnership is in
    straits and we need to help the PLO.&quot; Sharon [answered]: &quot;You mean that we
    should help that murderer [Arafat].&quot; Peres, angrily banging the table [responded]:
    &quot;And what about Egyptians with whom you, Likud, made peace? Didn't Egyptians murder
    Jews? Really. What's the difference between war and terrorism? Does it make any difference
    how 16,000 of our soldiers were killed? Everywhere, states are making deals with terror
    organizations.&quot; Netanyahu [spoke]: &quot;No state exists that has made a deal with an
    organization still committed to its destruction. The PLO has not rescinded the Palestinian
    Covenant. You are dwelling upon the crime committed in Hebron not in order to reassure
    people [Jews] living there but in order to advance your plan to establish a Palestinian
    state.&quot; Peres [answered]: &quot;It is you and your plans that will lead to the
    formation of a Palestinian state, because it is you, the Likud, that created the PLO in
    Madrid. It is you who conceived the autonomy in the first place, contrary to all our
    [previously pursued] aims.&quot; Netanyahu [stated]: &quot;Autonomy is not the same thing
    as state.&quot; Peres [continued]: &quot;But it is Sharon who is first to say that
    autonomy is bound to lead to a Palestinian state&#133;I am not less steadfast than are
    you; this is why I have elaborated the most restrictive possible interpretation of
    autonomy in Oslo, in relation to its territory, power and authorities. This is why we are
    against international observers and consent only to the temporary presence of
    representatives from the countries contributing money. And regarding the Palestinian
    Covenant, they have renounced it publicly, but they find it difficult to convene their
    representative bodies to ratify this renunciation.&quot; Begin [answered]: &quot;Let me
    remind you that the PLO has not undertaken publicly to rescind the Palestinian
    Covenant.&quot; Peres [answered]: &quot;I don't give a damn about you and/or your
    legalistic verbiage! Arafat said that he renounced the Palestinian Covenant and for me
    Arafat is the PLO.&quot;</p>

  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The above passage shows, among other things, that knowledge of Israeli
  politics and more generally Jewish affairs can be best attained by using the original
  sources of what Jews say among themselves.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The continuing process of Goldstein's elevation to the rank of saint by
  groups of Israeli Jews and his worship as such began soon after the massacre. In his
  February 28, 1994 Haaretz article, Shmuel Rosner recounted a sermon delivered on the
  Sabbath after the massacre by Rabbi Goren, the former chief military rabbi and chief rabbi
  of Israel. Rosner wrote: &quot;Goren' 5 conclusion was that next time an authorization
  would be needed for a massacre. The authorization should come from the community 'not from
  the [present] illegal government.&quot;' Rosner observed that the audience liked Goren's
  sermon but would have preferred, as would numerous other Israeli Jews, that the army
  rather than Goldstein had committed the massacre.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In the days and weeks after the massacre, appreciation of Goldstein and
  his deed spread throughout the Israeli religious community and among its supporters in the
  United States. The initial expressions of that appreciation may be most significant,
  because they were spontaneous and because they illustrated the influence, even beyond the
  messianic community, of an ideology that approved indiscriminate killing of Gentiles by
  Jews. Avirama Golan described in her February 28, 1994 Haaretz article how news about
  Goldstein on the day of the massacre became known in the overwhelmingly Haredi city of
  Bnei Brak and how the next day a religious Jewish crowd reacted with praise of Goldstein
  during a mass entertainment event. The massacre occurred on Purim, the festival during
  which religious Jews are merry and sometimes drink alcoholic beverages to the point of
  drunkenness. Bnei Brak streets were filled to capacity by joyful celebrants that day; a
  special security force, comprised of religious veterans of the Israeli army's elite units,
  had been hired by the mayor to enforce order and modesty. Golan described the response in
  the streets to the spreading news of the massacre:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A hired security guard, with a huge gun in his belt, a black skullcap on
    his head, and special insignia of &quot;Bnei Brak Security Team&quot; on his chest, stared
    at a fundraising stall. Then he noticed his pal across the street. &quot;A Purim miracle,
    I'm telling you, Purim miracle,&quot; he shouted at the top of his voice. &quot;That holy
    man did something great. 52 Arabs at one stroke.&quot; However, the fundraiser, a slim
    yeshiva student, was skeptical. &quot;That's just impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;Those
    must be just stories.&quot; But the people standing around confirmed the news. &quot;It
    was on the radio,&quot; they said. &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;In the Patriarchs' Cave in
    Hebron.&quot; The yeshiva student turned pale. &quot;I don't mind the Arabs, but it is us
    who will pay the price,&quot; he said. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; the
    security guard shouted, &quot;It's a Purim miracle. God has helped.&quot; People around
    the stall formed two groups: on the one hand those who said that God Himself ordained a
    well-deserved punishment of the Arabs; on the other, those who remained silent throughout.
    The fundraiser went on writing receipts and shaking his head. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said,
    &quot;nothing really happened.&quot; The Bnei Brak functionary's wife said that dozens of
    visitors who, as is customary on Purim, visited their home that morning, were shocked.
    &quot;By the murder?&quot; somebody asked. &quot;To tell you the truth, not exactly by the
    murder. About what may now happen to the Jews.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jumping to the evening of the next day, Golan continued: &quot;Masses of
  religious Jews were expected to come to Yad Eliahu Stadium [the biggest in Israel] to be
  entertained by the famous religious jazz singer, Mordechai Ben-David. For months before
  the massacre, this evening had been planned as a demonstration intended to save the land
  of Israel from Rabin, Peres and other Jewish infidels.&quot; All factions of the religious
  community were represented in the crowd. Golan again continued:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The first part of the evening passed quietly and even rather dully. Only
    after the intermission, some minutes before the star of the evening was to appear, the
    crowd went on a rampage. The master of the ceremony called upon a Kiryat Arba resident to
    address the crowd. He started by praising that &quot;righteous and holy physician, Dr
    Goldstein, who rendered us a sacred service and got martyred in the process.&quot; The
    speaker called upon the audience to mourn him. By and large, the audience remained silent.
    Some applauded. Only a single individual, wearing a small beard and a knitted skullcap,
    stood up and yelled: &quot;I disagree; that was a cold-blooded murder!&quot; Instantly he
    was physically assaulted. Many in the crowd yelled: &quot;Kick the infidel out of the
    hall!&quot; The tempers calmed down only when Ben-David finally appeared on the stage and
    began singing. Outside after the performance some people reminisced that more Gentiles had
    been killed by the Jews in Susa during the original Purim [75,000]. They, therefore,
    reasoned that this was the right time to kill a comparable number of Gentiles in the holy
    land.</p>
