Mar. 4, 1193, a Muslim warrior and</P><P>founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, was a staunch opponent of</P><P>the Crusades. Of Kurdish descent, Saladin was raised in</P><P>northern Syria, where members of his family were prominent</P><P>government and military leaders under the rule of the Zangid</P><P>dynasty. In 1152 he joined the staff of his uncle Shirkuh and</P><P>later accompanied (1169) Shirkuh, who headed a Zangid</P><P>army, to Egypt, where he helped the Fatimid rulers resist the</P><P>Crusaders. Shirkuh was appointed (1169) Fatimid vizier but</P><P>died two months later; Saladin, officially installed as Shirkuh's</P><P>successor, effectively repulsed the Crusaders. He solidified his</P><P>power base in 1171 when he overthrew the Fatimid dynasty,</P><P>returning Egypt to Islamic orthodoxy and becoming sole ruler</P><P>there.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>At the death (1174) of Nur al-Din, the Zangid ruler, Saladin</P><P>set out to conquer the Zangid kingdom in Syria as a</P><P>preliminary to the holy war (jihad) against the Crusaders.</P><P>Launching the jihad in 1187, Saladin was victorious at Hattin,</P><P>recaptured Jerusalem, and drove the Crusaders back to the</P><P>coast. These events prompted the Christians to mount the</P><P>Third Crusade (1189-92), pitting Saladin against Richard I of</P><P>England. The Crusaders succeeded only in capturing Acre,</P><P>and the Peace of Ramleh (1192) left the Latin Kingdom of</P><P>Jerusalem with only a small strip of land along the</P><P>Mediterranean coast.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Saladin not only vanquished the Crusaders but also restored</P><P>Egypt as the major power in the Middle East. Within Egypt he</P><P>established a stable dynasty, encouraged education, and</P><P>reformed the financial structure to support the armed Kurdish</P><P>and Turkish cavalry. Saladin also initiated a prolonged period</P><P>of economic prosperity, population growth, and cultural</P><P>revival. After he died, however, the Turks--especially the</P><P>Mamelukes--began to predominate.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Michael W.
