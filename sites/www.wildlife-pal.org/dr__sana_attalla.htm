in 20/5/1943. He finished high school studies at Bethlehem university at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>which he graduated. Then he went to study at American university in Beirut, he was accepted
in Physiology college , at which his instructors noticed that he had a special and a unique
intention to collect different animals and to conserve them, so they advised him to enroll to
biology college , and he did. He graduated from university in 1963 with B.A in Biology.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that he worked at the same college as an assistance to the research,
at the same time he worked hard to present his master degree, and he achieved that in 1965, and he
was appointed as and artistic researcher at the natural and historical museum at the same
university. During his work he helped to improve the museum and he also organized it, he got the
chance during this period to do field trips in several locations such as eastern Mediterranean Sea
in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan at which he collected several Samples of animals from these locations.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1960, he was selected to be a member in a scientific scholarship funded
by Chicago natural and historical museum, at which he was appointed as an expert for invertebrate
animals at that scholarship.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This scholarship continued about 6 months; during that period, he found a
very wide range to do his scientific research, this chance helped him to improve his talent, his
education and his experiences.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was also appointed the expert of invertebrate animals in Jordan-
International scholarship that was formed to study the species in Al Azraq project in Jordan in
1966. The Ministry of agriculture in Jordan elected him to be a consultant in Biology.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was optimistic so that although he got a lot of education, his
intellect was more genius than he had gained, and he was looking for getting more knowledge. He
traveled to U.S.A in 1966 at which he was appointed as assistance to the Biology Science at
Connecticet University in Stoors City, at which he started his researches to get his P.H.D. He got
his P.H.D certificate in 1969, (Invertebrates animals in eastern of Mediterranean areas) was the
title of his P.H.D.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked at the Invertebrates Animals Department in Samshonian<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Institute, he collected a large number of animals samples during his work at the institute,
he collected them from Taxes desert and the other areas that he visited. Those samples enriched the
Institute with samples that wasn't found there.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Sana concerned about the animals in eastern Mediterranean Sea, so he
left U.S.A and went to Iran to work there in Bahlwa University, at which he got the chance to do
field trips to study environment and natural animals, also he collected many samples of animals.
These samples that had been collected in a special building at the university. Dr Sana classified
the animals that he collected, so that the special building that had been made for them became a
large institute.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Sana was so active in his job but his destiny prevented him. When he
was in one of his field trips, a car accident happened between his car and a large lorry, so he was
died by this accident. After his death the institute that he made at the university was called under
his name Dr Sana Attalla.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience and knowledge that Dr Sana Attalla had gained through his study
trips made him able to write scientific articles that are considered now one of the most important
encyclopedias in the study of mammals in the middle east. His articles had published in one of his
scientific fields, his first articles published was about the presence of Honey Badger in Badana
district, he mentioned the description and the measurement of this animal and he also wrote about
the Similarities between this animal and the species that is alike in Europe. The second article had
published in 1976 and it was about a new kind of the Spiny mouse, no one study this kind of animal
before, which means that he discovered this animal, and he gave the measurement of this animal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Sana also wrote about his trips that he made in Al Azraq district at
which he described the mammals, reptiles and amphibians that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>inhibit
this area, he explained the environmental condition and the methods that he used to collect the
animals samples in this district. The samples the that he collected from this district were mammals
, shrew, Jakal and many other animals. By this article Dr Sana Attalla proved the existence of some
of mammals species in Jordan, and that was happened for the first time in the scientific
encyclopedias.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cooperation with Dr Louis and his wife Dr San Attalla mad a study about
rabbets and rodents (Lagomorpha, Rodentia) in Lebanon. This study had been made after a long study,
lasted for about seven years in Lebanon Mountains and slopes. They presented an adequate description
for 19 species of the Rabbets and Rodents in Lebanon, 15 of them were described adequately for the
first time, the rest were described before. The description of these species includes the whole
possible measurements for them and it show the habitat of these species on Lebanon map. This article
had enclosed by a classification that scientists could use to know the Rabbets and Rodents species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another article published in 1967 Dr Sana Attalla presented a
registration about the mammals he concentrated about the Rodents bats,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This study depended on samples that were taken from different areas from the south of
Lebanon,Jordan, Amman and the northern of Saudi Arabia. This study included different species from
these animals by depending on different measurements for these animals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Sana Attalla and his friend Dr Harison cooperated with each other to
publish Dr Sana Attalla article about Jerboa in 1968. In this article Dr Sana specify two kind of
Jerboa after a long and deep study in Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.
This study considered as a scientific reference about the classification situation for Jerboa animal
in the middle east. In this study he depended on the study of 71 samples that contained skins and
skulls of these animals and they can be found in Lebanon museum, UK museum, U.S.A museum. The study
that lasted for years in Lebanon that was made in cooperation with Dr Louis and his wife, Dr Sana
Attalla published references about mammals in Lebanon in 1968 in addition to what was published a
year before. The writers had presented an adequate description for 18 species of animals most of
them were of preditors. The writers depended on collecting samples and on the study of creatures in
nature. This job gave a clear data about mammals that inhibit in Lebanon and especially the species
that were in need of governmental care in order to prevent hunting and then put it in the "Red
Data Book of the World Wildlife Fund".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April 1970 a scientific study was published for Dr Sana Attalla, and it
was about a discovery of new subspecies of (Golden Spiny mouse). Dr Sana Attalla had given this
discovery his friends name, the well known scientists Dr David Harison (Acomys russatus Harrison),
because his friend studded mammals in the middle east and wrote many books about this subject. To
continue the mammals study in Lebanon Dr Sana published a scientific research about in 1970 in
Lebanon. He discovered through this study that there were two species of this animal and tey are (Mayotis
matteriri and Mayotis capaccini) in addition to the other species that were described in Lebanon
before and they are (Mytis blythi and Myotis Myotis), and he proved that (Myotis blythi had been
never found in Lebanon).<img border="0" src="images/Sana_A.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="454"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Sana Attalla proved his PHD thesis with a clear view about the area at
which, he divided the area to different geographical areas. He also gave a clear view about the
weather in these areas, because it affects the existence of the mammals species. His PHD thesis also
included a study to about 3000 animal samples he collected most of them from different areas in
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, these animals related to 94 species and to 100 subspecies. Dr San Attalla
presented a study about 70 species from.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

families, Genus, species), at which he gave the chance for scientific researcher to reach to the
animals classification in an easy way. His PHD thesis also included pictures to animals and the
areas that he made his study in PHD thesis also included maps that show the distribution of animals
in the Middle East, and the charts for the measurements of the animals that were studied.</p>
