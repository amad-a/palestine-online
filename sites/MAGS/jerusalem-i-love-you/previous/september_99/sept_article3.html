<h3>Boycott continues following AMJ-Burger King conference call</h3>

<p>(<i>WASHINGTON, DC, August 9, 1999</i>) - Muslims, Arabs and other people of conscience are urged to continue informing Burger King of their disagreement with that corporation's decision to open a restaurant in the West Bank settlement of Ma'ale Adumim.</p>
<p>American Muslims for Jerusalem (AMJ) today held a conference call with Burger King to discuss the boycott. &quot;The result of today's conversation is simple: Burger King will delay and discuss the issue with its Israeli franchisee and the boycott will continue,&quot; said AMJ Executive Director Khalid Turaani. &quot;The longer Burger King allows this to continue the more irrevocable the damage to their reputation, particularly in Muslim majority and Arab countries,&quot; said Turaani.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Arab League announced that support for the boycott will be discussed at its September 4-5 meeting. An Arab League resolution could force the closure of already established Burger King locations in Arab countries. On Monday, Assistant Secretary-General for Palestinian Affairs Said Kamal told Reuters, &quot;The Leagues general secretariat is waiting for the outcome of negotiations between the company and Arab and Islamic organizations before taking appropriate action.&quot;</p>
<p>According to an article published by iViews.com: &quot;A US Department of State official, asked what advice he would give to an American company intending to build a restaurant in Ma'ale Adumim, told iViews.com, 'This is a risky investment, any kind of long term investment there is risky. The status of that place is not yet decided. That's what official US policy is. We think that the Israeli settlement policy is destructive to the peace process.' An official with the US Department of Commerce responding to the same question said, 'I don't think we'd encourage it, that's safe to say.'&quot;</p>
<p>Burger King reports 10,365 restaurants worldwide (as of April 30, 1999). Of these 2,419 are located outside the United States. The corporation has a reported 82 locations in several Muslim majority nations including Turkey, Malaysia and several states in the Arab League. USA Today has reported that Burger King's CEO Dennis Malamatinas is specifically seeking to strengthen 
the organization in international markets.</p>
<p><h3>Action you may take:</h3> (Always remain polite and concise.)</p>
<p>Contact Burger King and request that they close the restaurant in the Ma'ale Adumim settlement.</p>

<p>You are also requested to inform as many people as possible about the boycott. This boycott will only work if the community remains involved.</p>
<h3>Talking Points:</h3>
<p>Burger King should now be aware of the serious nature of the situation. They should recognize that this boycott will hurt their profits in the short term and business expansion in the long term. Remind them that you will boycott their products until the restaurant in Ma'ale Adumim is closed.</p>
