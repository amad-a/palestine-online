<p>Among the wounds and pains of the events, some details are being neglected or maybe hidden by the totally Zionist controlled Arab and Western Media.</p>
<p>Shifa'a Tayseer Al-Hindi - 30 years old Palestinian girl form the town of Jadirah near Al-Quds- told her story from Al-Maqasid Hospital in occupied Al-Quds: 
"It was last Thursday evening when I was on my way back from Al-Aqsa Mosque, As I decided to buy some books before returning home.</p> 
<p>Three Zionist Soldiers stopped me; one of them asked me what does the bag contain? I answered that it only contains some papers and books. He took a paper from my bag and started to write on it, I asked him what he was doing? He answered that it is not of my business! I felt that he wanted to make me look like a spy reporting names of other youngsters opposing the occupation.</p> 
<p>He told me to take the veil off my face! I said: NO!! Then he savagely pulled the veil off my face, and in response to this humiliation I spat on his face! At this moment all 3 soldiers attacked me and hit me with their rifle butts on my head till I was knocked out. I didn't know how much time passed, but when I woke up I found young children trying to help me by washing my face with water, then I returned home. 
One day later, horrible pains attacked my head and I felt that I'm loosing my sight gradually, now I lost my sight COMPLETELY. </p>
<p>Dr.Hamodah Al-Faqih said that she was badly hurt by the strikes on her head, and we can't expect when she will have her sight back again.</p>
