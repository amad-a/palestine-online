  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Independent, 28 January 2001 </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and the Palestinians ended peace talks in Taba, Egypt, by
    announcing that they have &quot;never been so close to an agreement&quot;, as they joined
    forces in an 11th-hour attempt to save Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, from electoral
    defeat. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In a joint statement after five days of talks, they said that they
    &quot;shared the belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged&quot; with the resumption
    of negotiations following the Israel election on 6 February. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The sudden burst of optimism, after four months of violence and despite
    the lack of a deal, amounts to a last-ditch attempt to keep out Ariel Sharon, the
    right-wing 72-year-old who is the favourite to win the election. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Independent 28 January 2001 </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Fears are growing in the international community that Yasser Arafat's
    Palestinian Authority (PA) is heading for collapse, which would destroy any possibility of
    continuing the search for a peace agreement with Israel and plunge the West Bank and Gaza
    into anarchy. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Four months of Israeli-imposed blockades and other punitive sanctions have
    sent the Palestinian economy into deep recession, undermining the position of the
    authority, particularly on the West Bank. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week the European Union pushed through new loans to the PA, which was
    unable to pay its employees, not least because Israel held up the transfer of tax receipts
    and customs duties to the Palestinians. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We are close to a total collapse [of the PA] and the Israelis must
    know that this is against their interests,&quot; said a Western diplomat close to the
    Palestinian leadership. &quot;A collapse means that Israel won't have a partner in the
    peace process and it will ruin the Israelis' chance for security.&quot;</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Observer, 28 January 2001</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army has been hit by an unprecedented wave of disobedience as
    scores of soldiers refuse to serve in areas which have seen the worst violence during the
    Palestinian uprising. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Others have cut short their military service in protest at the Israeli
    control of Arab territories, against the measures used to tackle the four-month-long
    revolt, and against what they call the 'militarisation' of Israeli society. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Hundreds more serving soldiers have requested transfers from the West Bank
    and Gaza Strip or have refused reserve duty. Thousands of other young people are dodging
    military service - traditionally seen as one of the cornerstones of life in Israel. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">At least nine soldiers, including some from combat units and at least one
    reservist, have been jailed for taking a stand against military authorities since the
    start of the </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">intifada in September.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Daily Telegraph, 27 January 2001</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The crowds chant &quot;Arik, King of Israel&quot; when Ariel Sharon
    appears. They wave copies of Warrior, the memoirs of his military career.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">They proclaim: &quot;Sharon knows how to deal with the Arabs. If they fire
    a bullet, he'll respond with a missile.&quot; At 72, a veteran of all of Israel's five
    wars, the warrior is returning to claim his reward. Mr Sharon is fighting his last
    campaign, a political battle to replace the discredited Ehud Barak as prime minister.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Barring a miracle, he will be elected to that office in 10 days' time,
    capping an extraordinary career as soldier and politician. For the Israeli Left, a
    nightmare is taking shape. An Israeli Caesar, regarded as a war criminal by the Arabs, is
    about to take power. For decades the Israeli establishment has regarded Mr Sharon as a
    loose cannon whose extraordinary military talents and well-focused aggression were useful
    in war but dangerous in peace time.</p>

  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Times, 27 January 2001</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, has become embroiled in a dispute between
    the Jewish diaspora and Israel after he suggested that even a democratically elected
    Israeli Government did not have the right to relinquish control of Jerusalem&#146;s Temple
    Mount. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">His remarks, made in a letter to Ehud Olmert, the right-wing Mayor of
    Jerusalem, have provoked criticism in Israel, which is preparing to go to the polls early
    next month with the future of the Holy City a key campaign issue. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ehud Barak, the Israeli Prime Minister, who is trailing in opinion polls
    against Ariel Sharon, the leader of the main right-wing opposition Likud Party, accepted
    an American peace proposal earlier this month that would have handed sovereignty of the
    Temple Mount to the Palestinians. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Chicago Tribune, 27 January 2001 </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">After attacking Prime Minister Ehud Barak for negotiating with the
    Palestinians during the intifada, Israeli right-wing leader Ariel Sharon has come under
    criticism for sending his son and two advisers to an unusual meeting with a top
    Palestinian envoy.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..After the meeting, Barak accused Sharon of hypocrisy and meddling in the
    negotiations while Sharon was grilled by Israeli journalists about Palestinian officials'
    claims that among the topics at the session was the fate of the Palestinians' closed
    casino in Jericho.</p>
