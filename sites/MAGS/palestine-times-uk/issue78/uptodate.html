<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (30 December) </FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Asserting inter-faith unity in the face of Zionist occupation
and oppression,  Jerusalemite Muslims and Christians last night celebrated
the advent of the holy month of Ramadan at Orient House, the unofficial
PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At a  reception hosted by Faisal Husseini, Christian and
Muslim leaders reaffirmed the traditionally good relations between Palestinian
Muslims and Christians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Christians make up around 6% of the Palestinian population
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rev. Atallah Hana of the Roman Orthodox Patriarchate in
Jerusalem congratulated Muslims for the advent of the &quot;holy month of
Ramadan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Attalah said &quot;we are one people facing a common destiny...we
are proud that our harmonious coexistence is based on the Uhda al Umariya&quot;
the covenant given by the second caliph Omar to Christians on the conquest
of the city by Muslim armies in 636 A.D which guaranteed Christian freedom
of worship and the sanctity of churches and places of worship. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;For those who would like to fish in troubled waters,
I say 'your sly and vindictive designs will not succeed because we are one
family,&quot; said Attalah alluding to repeated Israeli attempts to implant
the seeds of division between Muslims and Christians in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The reception, opened with recitation from the Holy Quran,
was attended by a number of foreign ambassadors and other dignitaries, including
Michael Sabbah, the highest-ranking Roman Catholic clergyman in the Middle
East.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sabbah, a Palestinian from Nazareth, said &quot;we stand
here Muslims and Christians to celebrate the advent of the month of Ramadan
as we celebrated together a few days ago the birth of Christ...We extend
our greeting to our Muslim brothers on the solemn occasion, hoping that
God accept their fasting.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that &quot;insinuations and innuendoes have been
voiced of late concerning the status of Christian-Muslim relations. I'm
here to declare that our relations have never been better. We are one big
family.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Hasan Tahbub, who assumes the religious affairs
portfolio in PA administration, said in a brief statement &quot;I warn that
al Masjidul Aksa (Aksa Mosque) is a red line and that we will not sit idle
if it came under aggression.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier this week, the Israeli authorities uncovered a
plot by two ultra religious Jews to throw a pig's head onto the Haram al
Sharif compound in the hope that this would spark off bloodshed and violence
in the city.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many ultra-religious Jews and most settlers in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip believe that redemption for the Jewish people can
only be realized through &quot;total war against the goyem&quot; or gentiles
in which hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people would be killed.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Supreme Islamic Council denounces Jewish
racism</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (29 December)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the eve of the holy month of Ramadan, Israeli troops
were put on high alert along the &quot;friction line&quot; between East
and West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources said police presence was also reinforced
in Jerusalem's Old Town, particularly in the vicinity of Islamic holy places
in the town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, the Israeli authorities disclosed that several
ultra-religious Jews were detained for &quot;planing to throw a pig's head
into the Haram al Sharif compound for the purpose of sparking off violence
and bloodshed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The suspects, who confessed to having sought to carry out
the blasphemous act, belonged to Gush Emunim, a messianic Jewish movement
advocating &quot;total war&quot; with Arabs and Muslims in particular and
Gentiles in general.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier this year, a Jewish woman pasted posters on storefronts
in Hebron caricaturing the Prophet Mohammed (may peace be on him) as a pig
writing the Quran.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The foiled &quot;pig-head&quot; attack coincided with revelations
that Jewish extremists were working unabatedly to destroy the Al Aksa Mosque
and Dome of the Rock in order to &quot;accelerate the process of redemption
of the Jewish people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources said the perpetrators or would-be-perpetrators
were only a small part of a significant segment of the Israeli Jewish population
who would like to see al Masjidul Aksa reduced to rubble.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 29 December, the Supreme Islamic Council in Jerusalem
condemned &quot;the evil designs against our holy places.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Mohammed Hussein, a council senior member, warned
&quot;provocations against us won't hurt Muslims only, Jews would be hurt
as well.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation authorities have decided
to form a special police force to oversee the demolition of Arab homes in
East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The outgoing Israeli Police Inspector, Assaf Efets, said
the force would escort bulldozers destined to destroy Arab houses and also
collect data concerning &quot;illegal Arab building&quot; in Jerusalem,
an allusion to Palestinian homes constructed without an Israeli license.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel very often denies Palestinians building licenses
as part of a concerted policy aimed at checking Arab demographic expansion
and preventing Arab population growth.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Leaders: &quot;Muslims! wake
up, al Masjidul Aksa is in danger&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (27 December) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian leaders representing various political and
ideological orientations have again warned that the al Aksa Mosque is facing
the danger of destruction at the hands of Jewish extremists in connivance
with the Israeli governments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The renewed Palestinian concern comes on the eve of the
disclosure by the Israeli Police Inspector Assaf Hefets on Friday that extremist
elements affiliated with the Gush Emunim movement were planing to destroy
al Aksa Mosque for the purpose of &quot;rebuilding the Temple of Solomon
on its site and achieving redemption for the Jewish people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Haidar Abdul Shafi, a legislative council member and outstanding
public figure in Gaza, said he was not surprised by the grave revelations
because the &quot;whims of these movements are well-known and border on
madness.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Shafi said the vital question now is &quot;how should
Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims do to forestall the diabolical Israeli designs?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;All our holy shrines are in danger and I can't really
overestimate the gravity of the situation.. I'm afraid that one day we will
wake up to the sad news that the al Aksa mosque has been demolished.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Hamas has reacted strongly to Hefets' disclosures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, the movement's principal spokesman
in Gaza, accused the Israeli state of &quot;harboring definite designs to
destroy the al Aksa Mosque.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The collective Israeli state is involved in this
evil scheme...the subterranean tunnels they are digging beneath the mosque
testify to their sinister designs,&quot; Rantisi said in a telephone interview
on Saturday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi called on Muslims worldwide to &quot;initiate an
action proportionate to the looming danger facing the mosque before it is
too late.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Israeli occupation of al Aksa was a great catastrophe
for Muslims; the destruction of the paramount Shrine now in the full view
of over a billion Muslims would be even a greater catastrophe,&quot; he
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, Hefets, whose term of office will end next week,
revealed that two extremist Israelis arrested last week were planing to
offend Muslim sentiments by wrapping a pig's head with pages of the Holy
Qura'an and place it at the Dome of the Rock during the month of Ramadan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said the sacrilegious act would have sparked off &quot;a
blood bath&quot; in the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, Israeli police detained two Israeli Jews who
had immigrated from the former Soviet Union for unspecified offenses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two, according to Israeli sources, were newly-recruited
members of Gush Emunim, a movement advocating &quot;the Greater Israel&quot;
idea.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Followers of the movement fiercely oppose peace between
Israel and the Arabs on the grounds that it would postpone or slow down
the process of &quot;redemption&quot; for the Jewish people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The movement's spiritual mentor, Rabbi Abraham Cook, wrote
the redemption must be preceded by bloodshed and violence on a genocidal
scale.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, followers often seek to initiate attacks on Muslim
holy places in Jerusalem and Hebron in the hope that this would generate
violent reactions on the part of the Arab-Muslim side. <BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu: I want to see Palestinians at
each other's necks</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(25 September) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benaymin Netanyahu has expressed
renewed discontent with the &quot;memorandum of understanding,&quot; which
contained terms of &quot;security cooperation and coordination&quot; between
Israel and Yaser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In statements published in leading Israeli dailies on Thursday,
Netanyahu said the document was incomplete and needed to be revised.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are talking only about a draft copy at the moment.
The document has yet to be approved. Our instructions to our representatives
were that they should go and listen to the other side and tell them of our
demands that they fulfill their commitments. The security document at the
moment is still only one of principles and is not a detailed plan,&quot;
Netanyahu said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli premier didn't spell out what he would like
to see added to the document.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Israeli sources indicated that Netanyahu would
like to put in the document clauses obliging the PA to, inter alia, hand
over Islamist detainees in PA-run jails to Israel, escalate the policy of
administrative detention (incarceration without trial for prolonged periods)
ravage the infrastructure of the Islamic movements, exercise tighter scrutiny
over the content of Friday sermons, exclude anti-Israeli references from
Palestinian media, and close down all Palestinian institutions that are
run by individuals or groups deemed anti-Israeli.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu said the existing document had many shortcomings
and inadequacies, adding that drafts were defective which necessitated that
they be resubmitted to the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's statements contradict assertions by key PA
officials that the document was signed under the supervision of CIA representatives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday 24 December, Muhammed Dahlan, head of the
Preventive Security Force (PSF) in Gaza vowed that the PA &quot;will not
agree to change even a single word of the document.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said the document was acceptable to the PA because it
contained the element of reciprocity, a claim the Israelis have strongly
denied.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA has complained to the United States about the release
from an Israeli lockup on Monday 22 December of an Israeli army officer
who last year killed an Arab child, Helmi al Shawashe, of the village of
Husan near Bethlehem, by smashing his head with his personal fire-arm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sa'eb Urekat, the chief PA negotiator, protested during
a radio interview with the PA radio station &quot;the Voice of Palestine,&quot;
that &quot;how could they dare demand that we round up Hamas activists when
they quietly release the murderers of our children from jail only a few
months or weeks from committing their crimes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Urekat's lamentation, however, is not likely to be translated
into a strong Palestinian stance in the face of Israeli blackmail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Observers notice that the sole decision-maker in the PA
is Yaser Arafat, a man often reputed of caving in to Israeli and American
demands, especially those pertaining to repressing the opponents of the
Israeli occupation, particularly the Islamists, within the autonomous enclaves.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>CIA 'to tell Arafat whom to hold in jail'</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The United States will be the ultimate arbiter in decisions
over which Islamist militants should be detained or freed as part of moves
to put the Middle East peace process back on track according to Israeli
news reports yesterday (Friday).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The agreement, worked out by Palestinian, Israeli and US
security officials, is aimed at assuaging fears that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority rounds up extremists after major atrocities and then quietly releases
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said that
any withdrawal from the West Bank would take place only after a five-month
&quot;testing period&quot;. His government would proceed only if the Palestinians
proved that they were seriously cracking down on militants.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Yediot Aharonot daily newspaper claimed that an agreement
among the parties stipulates that the Palestinians will give the US Central
Intelligence Agency's representative in Israel advance notice of the names
of detainees they plan to release.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The CIA will then inform Israel of impending releases and
Israel will be given an opportunity to voice objections. In the end, the
Palestinian Authority can release detainees only with US approval, Yediot
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A senior Palestinian security official refused to comment
on the report. But Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary-general of the Palestinian
cabinet, said: &quot;No one has veto power over the Palestinians, not the
United States and not Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr Netanyahu said that he could not guarantee that his
cabinet's deliberations on the scale of any pullback from the West Bank
would be completed by the time he expects to meet President Clinton in late
January or early February.</FONT></P>

PA official says &quot;January&quot; will be decisive in peace process</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT( 21 December) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A prominent Palestinian official close to PA chai&szlig;rman
Yaser Arafat has warned that &quot;next month will be decisive as far as
the peace process is concerned.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Abu Rudeineh, who is accorded the official title
&quot;Presidential Spokesman,&quot; pointed out on Sunday that the meetings
US president Bill Clinton is slated to have with Israeli Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu and PA Chairman Yaser Arafat at the White House in mid
January would be &quot;very very important.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The outcome of these meetings would decide if the
peace process would continue or reach its end,&quot; said Abu Rudeineh</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Rudeineh said Netanayhu was almost solely responsible
for the current deadlock of the peace process and would bear responsibility
for its eventual death in case the present Israeli policies continued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;There can be no peace as long the Israeli occupation
of the West Bank continues,&quot; Abu Rudeineh said in an interview with
the Ramallah-based &quot;Voice of Palestine&quot; on Sunday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Rudeineh labeled Netanyahu's recent statements in which
he said the West Bank was an integral part of Israel as &quot;another attempt
to kill the peace process altogether.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Saturday, PA Secretary-General Al Tayyeb Abdul Rahim,
said the Palestinians would invoke the implementation of UN resolution 181,
issued in 1947, which called for partitioning Palestine into two states,
Arab and Jewish.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Rahim told &quot;Agance France Presse&quot; that
the PLO would revert to resolution 181 if Israel continued its current policy
of territorial expansion and aggrandizement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, the Israeli premier said in a TV interview that
&quot;the West Bank is an integral part of Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1948, Jews possessed less than 10 per cent of Palestine
and their population didn't exceed 15% of the overall population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Jewish state, using a variety of oppressive
tactics, sought successfully to expel Palestinians and seize their lands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are over four million Palestinian refugees in the
Diaspora today, and serious observers and pundits believe that there could
be no genuine and lasting peace between Arab and Jews unless the refugees
were allowed to return to their homes and lands from which they were expelled
at gun point in 1948.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli soldiers in Hebron opened
fire randomly at Palestinian passers-by near the Shalala street.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hospital sources in Hebron said at least two Palestinians
sustained &quot;medium injuries&quot; after having been hit by &quot;rubber
bullets with metallic nucleus.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the hospital source, the two people injured
are Khalil Ahmed al Nawaja'a, 47, and Sueliman Muhammed Abu Sabha, 60, both
from the village of Yatta, 15 miles south west of Hebron. <BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel is to demolish mosque in Al-Lud</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (20 December) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli local authorities in Lud, a mixed Arab-Jewish town
in pre-1967 Palestine, have ordered the demolition of a large mosque in
the town on the pretext that the mosque had been constructed without proper
licensing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said the Israeli &quot;ministry of
interior&quot; authorities issued the order to demolish &quot;Masjidul Sahaba&quot;
last week with instructions to carry out the demolition in twenty four hours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the actual demolition has not been executed probably
because of the angry reactions the demolition order has generated among
the Muslim population in Lud and the rest of Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, the Islamist mayor of the Arab town of Um al
Fahem, Sheikh Ra'ed Salah, led the congregational Juma'a prayer at the Mosque.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking before thousands of worshipers, Salah said &quot;the
Israeli authorities are not showing any respect for Muslim holy places,&quot;
adding that &quot;Muslims must stand up to defend the houses of God.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said the destruction of any Mosque was an abhorrent
act of diabolical proportions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He recited the Quranic verse:&quot; And who does greater
wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of God lest
His name be mentioned therein, and striveth to ruin...Theirs in the world
is ignominy and theirs in the Heareafter is an awful doom.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Muslims in Palestine are convinced that the planned demolition
of the mosque was part of a concerted Israeli policy of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;
not dissimilar from what the Serbs did in Bosnia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We consider this evil act merely a reflection of
the sinister Zionist policy against Muslims in Palestine,&quot; said Muhammed
Ghanem Abu Suleiman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He pointed out that for fifty years, as many as 35 Jewish
synagogues had been built &quot;and only one mosque...and now they are trying
to level it to the ground.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Tawfiq Ahmed, a community activist, said the demolition
order &quot;carries a grave message...that we don't want to see Muslims
or Muslim symbols in this land.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic movement in the Palestinian territory occupied
in 1948 (Israel) has condemned the demolition order, labeling it &quot;a
hateful act of savagery and racism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The movement issued a written statement in its weekly &quot;Voice
of Truth and Freedom&quot; reminding the world public opinion that Jewish
settlers destroyed anther mosque near Akka (Masjid Um Faraj) about ten days
ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pundits here say religious freedoms for non-Jews in Israel
are restricted in varying degrees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They point out that the Israeli authorities still deny
Muslims and Christians in the Occupied Territories free access to their
respective holy places in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

PA Jail</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(17 December)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Scores of Palestinian political detainees have started
a hunger strike at the PA lockup in Dahairiyya, 20 kilometers west of Hebron,
Palestinian sources said Wednesday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The usually reliable sources said the mostly Islamist detainees
decided to go on a hunger strike after the prison administration failed
to make good on a promise that had been made to the detainees to charge
them or get them released.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most of the detainees on the hunger strike are reportedly
from the Nablus area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources revealed a partial list of the detainees,
including Eyad Marwan, Sami Jabarin, Ala'a Humeidan, Ra'ed Kukah and Fahim
Dawabshe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The above-mentioned were rounded up by various PA security
agencies following the two bomb attacks in West Jerusalem in Summer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The detainees reportedly included a number of pro-Hamas
students studying at the Najah National University in Nablus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, the PA (<I>mukhabarat)</I> intelligence
Service have been interrogating leaders of the teachers' union in the West
Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to a source close to the union, the interrogation
centered on their role in a teacher strike earlier this year protesting
teachers' low salaries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity,
said PA interrogators accused the teachers of &quot;mixing education with
politics and of have been politically motivated&quot; in the said crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source added that a security file was opened for each
teacher participating in the strike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The teacher union is an elected body representing more
than 15,00 teachers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An average Palestinian teacher receives a monthly salary

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (15 December) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli army bulldozers demolished on Monday four Palestinian
homes at the village of Asira al Shamaliya near Nablus in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian and Israeli sources said the Israeli army imposed
a military curfew on the village at dawn Monday, declaring the area a closed
military zone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The four homes, belonging to families of Palestinians suspected
of having carried out the two bomb attacks in West Jerusalem earlier this
summer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said as many as 30 men, women and children
became homeless as a result of the callous Israeli act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, human rights organizations sought to cancel the
Israeli decision to destroy the four homes on the basis of the fact that
the victims (the now-homeless inhabitants) were being punished for crimes
they neither committed nor knew of or about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, it was argued that the destruction of Palestinian
homes proved no deterrent to Palestinian resistance to the evil Israeli
occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The demolition of Arab homes has been an established Israeli
policy since the occupation of the West Bank by Israel in 1967.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel routinely uses &quot;collective punishment&quot;
against the Palestinian population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians often describe the torment meted out to them
by the Israelis as &quot;transcending reality.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli Officials downplay Khatami's statements</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (15 December)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli officials on Monday sought to downplay the significance
of the reportedly conciliatory statements made Sunday by Iranian President
Dr.Muhammed Khatami.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khatami was quoted as calling for &quot;a meaningful and
sincere dialogue between Iran and the West, including the United States,&quot;
adding that &quot;the Islamic Republic was not seeking confrontation with
any body but seeking friendship on the basis of dignity and parity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He also said that Iran was supporting a peace in the Middle
East based on justice and one that would enable the Palestinians to recover
their rights and to return to their usurped land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Defense Minister Mordechai, himself of an Iranian-Kurdish
origin, said in a radio interview Monday morning that &quot;statements alone
are not enough...and that we want to see deeds not words.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mordechai added that while the statements were ostensibly
positive, it would be too premature to pass a final judgment on the new
Iranian regime.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The hawkish Israeli war minister, who adopted the bone-breaking
policy toward the Palestinians during the intifada, demanded that Iran &quot;obtain
a certificate of good conduct by terminating its armament programs and by
ending support for terrorist groups.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mordechai's remarks were an obvious allusion to Lebanese
and Palestinian resistance movements fighting Israeli occupation in the
West Bank and Southern Lebanon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Foreign Minister David Levy described Khatami's statements
as &quot;the first positive signs coming out of Iran since the Khumeini
revolution.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, like Mordechai, Levy said Iran ought to &quot;end
its support for terrorism, stop its armament program, and support the peace
process.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel, it is well established, is the only state in the
Middle East possessing the a huge stockpile of arms of mass destruction,
including a sizable nuclear arsenal including as many as 300 nuclear bombs
and warheads.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel has also refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Louis Farakhan: &quot;I'm anti-oppression
not anti-Semitic&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(15 December) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Louis Farakhan, leader of the US-based &quot;Nation of
Islam&quot; lashed out on Sunday on &quot;those who accuse me of being anti-Semitic,&quot;
saying their accusations were motivated by malice or ignorance or a combination
of both.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking in East Jerusalem before departing for Jordan,
Farakhan accused the Zionist-controlled media of &quot;seeking deliberately
to distort my statements and views because they don't like the issues I
raise in my speeches.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They and those who stand behind them don't like the
issues I adopt such as human equality and opposition to exploitation of
man by fellow man, and opposition to oppression, occupation and all sorts
of injustices.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farakhan canceled a scheduled visit to the al Aksa Mosque
where he was supposed to perform noon prayer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government, which was taken by surprise by
the visit, didn't welcome Farakhan's visit to Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>David Bar-Ellan, head of the planing department at the
Prime Minister's Office, vilified Farakhan as &quot;hater of Israel and
the Jewish people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bar-Ellan said Farakhan was not to be welcomed in Israel,
adding, however, that as an American citizen, he was entitled to visit as
a tourist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farakhan is anathema to the Zionist circles in the United
States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>His repeated accusations that Jews played a significant
role in the slave trade drew indignant reactions from Jewish leaders who
in turn accused him of being anti-Semitic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On many occasions, Farakhan labeled the ready charge of
&quot;anti-Semitism&quot; as &quot;a sword of terror in the face of truth.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Sunday, Farakhan met with Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yaser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farakhan was quoted as saying that the peace process wouldn't
succeed if it didn't enable the Palestinians to restore their legitimate
rights, especially the right to return to their homeland from which they
were expelled by the Zionists in 1948.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>&quot;al Quds-in-danger&quot; contest</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (13 December) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamist leaders in the Palestinian territory occupied
in 1948 (Israel) are planning to hold a worldwide contest aimed at increasing
Muslim awareness of the dangers besetting Jerusalem and Islamic Holy shrines
therein, Palestinian sources said on Saturday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ra'ed Salah, mayor of the Arab town of Um al Fahem,
said he hoped that a million Muslims would take part in the contest which
he said was aimed at &quot;making Muslims around the world well aware of
the looming dangers facing Jerusalem and Islamic and Christian holy places.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We have one al Quds, and one Aksa, and if Israel
succeeded God forbids in making them disappear, then no Muslim would have
the audacity to view himself or herself in the mirror,&quot; Said Salah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said he got the idea of the contest, which would
have &quot;al Quds in danger&quot; as the main slogan, after several visits
he had made to the Islamic Shrines in Jerusalem and seeing the continuing
digging by the Israeli authorities beneath al Masjidul Aksa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said he was hopeful that there would be an overwhelming
Islamic response, especially from ordinary Muslims &quot;who do care about
Jerusalem and the frantic Israeli Jewish campaign to obliterate its Islamic
identity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, the steering committee of the contest has contacted
several prominent Muslim leaders and scholars who expressed their willingness
and desire to take part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several Islamic thinkers have already expressed enthusiasm
for the grand scheme including Mustafa Mash-hur, leader of the Ikhwan al
Muslimun (Muslim Brotherhood) movement in Egypt, Abu al Hasan al Nadawi
of India (a prominent Islamic thinker and scholar), Sheikh Yousef al Qardawi,
Dr. Abdul Fattah al Uweisi, Kamel al Shrif of Jordan, Rashed al Ghannoushi
of Tunisia, Hamed Beitawi of Palestine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the steering committee, contacts are being
made with Sheikh Muhammed Hussein Fadlulah and Muhammed Mahdi Shamsuddin
of Lebanon, and several prominent Iranian, Saudi, Pakistani and Turkish
Islamist scholars and leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mustafa Mash-hur was quoted in the Islamist weekly <I>Saut
al Haq </I>wal Hurriya (voice of Truth and Freedom) on 12 December as saying
that &quot;It imperative for all Muslims to demonstrate that our holy places
are cheap and easy targets for desecration and destruction.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu al Hasan al Nadawi, one of the most prominent Islamic
thinkers in India and the world at large, urged &quot;the Umma in the four
corners of the world to rally behind Jerusalem and not to let the Jews repeat
what happened at Ayodia, when Hindu militants destroyed a historical Islamic
Shrines several years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said the contest would, God Willing, awaken Muslims
to the dangers and perils surrounding al Masjidul Aksa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The time for sleep 's gone...so wake up Muslims before
it is too late because your first Kibla and third Holiest Mosque is in danger.&quot;
Salah said. <BR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (6 December)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli settlers on Thursday 4 December demolished a Mosque
at the Arab village of Um Faraj near Akka, Palestinian sources said on Friday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ra'ed Salah, head of the Islamist movement across
the Green line (pre-1967 Palestine) said Jewish settlers from a Kibbutz
called &quot;Bne Ami&quot; brought a bulldozer on Thursday to demolish the
mosque which was built in 1934.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eyewitnesses, said the settlers embarked on their crime
under the cover of the night and, consequently, the demolition could not
have been filmed or photographed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah expressed profound outrage at the &quot;evil act,&quot;
saying &quot;the destruction of the houses of worship is a red line everywhere
except in Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He pointed out that the destruction of the Um-al Faraj
Mosque was only the latest incident in a series of attacks on and desecration
of Muslim holy sites throughout the country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He cited the unearthing by bulldozers of several ancient
Muslim cemeteries and the desecration of numerous mosques &quot;from Beir
al Sabah in the south to Safad in the north.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah pointed out that in Safad alone, the Israeli authorities
have destroyed 17 mosques since 1948, leaving only a small mosque and minaret
intact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Salah, other mosques have been turned into
&quot;dens for drug addicts, gambling houses, and places of ill-repute.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the al Aksa Committee, an Islamic society
dedicated to the protection of Muslim holy places, lamented the destruction
of the Mosque at Um Faraj by the Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It reminds me of the destruction of Jewish synagogues
by the Nazis in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s...now the former victims are
doing the same thing to us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, scores of Israeli soldiers raided
the home of Naim Tubasi, head of the Palestinian Journalists Union, in Ramallah
on Thursday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Tubasi's son, Ibrahim, as many as 30 Israeli
soldiers stormed the house, located on Ramallah's southern outskirts, around
1:30 after midnight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They pounded savagely on the outer door, terrorizing
the entire family...Then they made their way to my father's small library,
inquiring about his possession of certain books critical of the Israeli
occupation and of Zionism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The raid on Tubasi's home has been condemned by the Palestinian
Legislative Council and human rights organizations in the Occupied Territories.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel destroys more Arab homes in West Bank</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (4 December)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Consistent with its racist policy toward the Palestinians,
Israel has escalated the extremely harsh practice of demolishing Arab homes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday 3 December, the Israeli army destroys at least
two residential homes belonging to poor Palestinian villagers at al Sawahra
al Sharkiya near Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, bulldozers driven by
Israeli soldiers also destroyed a third home at the village of Aleizariya
(Bethany) on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two demolished homes near Bethlehem belonged to Khleif
Ramadan Za'atreh, 30, and Mahmud Eibidat, respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eyewitnesses said crack troops stormed the al Sawahra al
Sharkiya on Wednesday morning, cordoned off the first home, giving dwellers
a one-hour grace to get their belongings because &quot;we are going to destroy
your home.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On hearing the &quot;shocking ultimatum,&quot; Khleif's
mother, 75, fainted and was transferred to hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I didn't know what to do, to comfort my family, or
accompany my mother to hospital, or watch my home which I built brick by
brick using up all my savings of 15 years...may God help me,&quot; said
Khlief, father of five children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After fulfilling the first part of &quot;mission brutality,&quot;
the same IDF bulldozer moved to a neighboring home belonging to Mahmud Ebeidat,
repeating the same evil act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Israeli troops destroyed a multi-story house
at al Eizariya belonging to Abdul Rahman Ali Naser Hubani.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The three homes, say Palestinians, are located in the midst
of Arab residential areas, and the land on which they were built is not
slated for bypass roads or Jewish settlements, the usual Israeli pretexts
for destroying Arab homes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians contend the real motive behind the demolition
is to prevent Arab demographic expansion in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another more fundamental reason lies in wanting to torment
Palestinians and make their life in Palestine unbearable that they would
eventually contemplate leaving their home-country.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians hope OIC will adopt strong stance
on Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (3 December)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority officials have voiced optimism that
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) summit in Tehran next week
will take a strong stance on Jerusalem and the looming dangers imperiling
Islamic shrines in the town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Amre, a close advisor to PA Chairman Yaser Arafat,
said the Palestinian leadership was expecting &quot;tangible results&quot;
from the OIC summit on two levels, the bilateral relations between Iran
and the PA, and a meaningful collective Islamic stance to counter Israeli
intransigence and insolence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We will have a meaningful dialogue with our Iranian
brothers and friends in order to overcome the misunderstandings that have
blemished our relations,&quot; said Amre in a telephone interview from his
home in Hebron on Wednesday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amre added that the PA &quot;is having paramount interest
in the conference and is looking forward to seeing strong and tangible decisions
supportive of Palestinian rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The battle of Jerusalem has begun, and the OIC must
take not of that, because al Quds is first and foremost an Islamist issue,
after all,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian delegation to the OIC summit will be headed
by PA Chairman Yaser Arafat who would deliver &quot;a key speech&quot; at
the conference, accentuating frantic Zionist efforts to obliterate the Islamic
identity of Jerusalem and the perils facing the Aksa Mosque and other Islamic
holy places in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a chief spokesman of the PA, said Arafat
would urge Muslim leaders to &quot;find ways and means to strengthen the
Islamic presence in Jerusalem.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Rudeineh also said Arafat would demand that the Islamic
states put a collective stance against Israel and its insolent disregard
for Palestinian rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Relations between Iran and the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) and latter the PA underwent up-and-down episodes since Iranian Islamic
revolution in 1978.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Initially, the new revolutionary government in Tehran lauded
PLO chairman Yaser Arafat and even turned the former Israeli embassy into
&quot;embassy of Palestine.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, relations deteriorated afterwards for two reasons,
PLO backing of Iraq during the 8-year Iraq-Iran war and the conclusion of
the Oslo Accords, which the Islamic Republic viewed as &quot;tantamount
to treachery.&quot;</FONT></P>
