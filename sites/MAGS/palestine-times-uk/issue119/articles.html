<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Good Morning, Palestine</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Erik Paul</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Good morning, Palestine! What a beautiful day it is today. The sun is
shining, the temperature is around the seasonal average and winds are moderate and
north-westerly. The seas bordering Palestine are calm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s a great day, people. And I&#146;m your deejay (DJ) to make sure
you have the best day ever. If you just woke up, then grab some coffee and enjoy the show
on Radio Palestine. That is, if you still have a stove to make coffee on and if you still
have a home that you can wake up in. But, hey, as long as the Israelis are happy, no
problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you now live in a tent as a re-refugee in a refugee camp, I welcome you
to my programme. Look at the bright side. It&#146;s almost summer, so you won&#146;t get
frostbite. Think of the whole affair as camping out. Some of you have no doubt experienced
living in tents before, like when you were displaced in 1948. Others of you might have
been displaced in 1967 and some of you have been displaced several times more. But you can
forget all your troubles while listening to my show.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember doing a similar show during the Nam war. But you see, things
were different then. What the North Vietnamese were afraid of was that the South
Vietnamese would not convert to Communism. Then you know what happened after the Americans
lost a lot of their servicemen, they just took off and ran, leaving the Northerners to
slaughter those of the Southerners they felt deserved to die. Now things are different.
Let me tell you this, Communism is nothing compared to the reincarnation of
Evil&#150;Sharon. He&#146;s not out to convert us native Palestinians to Zionism, my
friends, he is simply out to exterminate us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Remember those good ol&#146; Americans? They chickened out of Nam, but we
can see their weapons everywhere, killing us, and we can feel their presence making sure
that the Israelis do a good job getting rid of us. The funny thing is, every time those
Israeli bulldozers move in and demolish more homes and uproot more trees, Sharon claims
such actions are &#147;anti-terrorist.&#148; Can you beat that? There must be a new
definition to terrorism that we have not yet heard of. Why, in Khan Younis refugee camp,
400 people were left homeless because of such anti-terrorist actions. There is now a
refugee camp within a refugee camp. The first ever in the Middle East. We might even get
in the <i>Guinness World Book of Records</i> for such feats.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And when some of the occupants of Khan Younis camp tried to see what was
happening to the houses of relatives and friends, they were shot down in cold blood by the
Israelis. Everyone knows that onlookers are terrorists and that bulldozers and tanks and
Israelis aiming to kill are harmless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fierce gun battles broke out in the Gaza Strip after Israeli tanks entered
Palestinian-controlled territory. Good morning, Gaza! How are you faring after Israeli
army bulldozers backed by 3 tanks demolished a Palestinian military intelligence
headquarters and 15 Palestinian houses? How can anyone be expected to be feeling after 35
Palestinians were wounded, including a 16-year-old boy whose leg was blown off by a tank
shell? No Israeli casualties were reported, of course.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Six other Palestinians were injured in the Qalandia refugee camp in the
West Bank as Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli troops who responded with live
and rubber bullets and tear gas, too. Good morning, Qalandia! I hope all is well with you
this bright sunny morning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli forces entered the Rafah area and demolished several houses which
Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Evil Reincarnated and Evil Incorporated, claims were used as
hiding places for gunmen firing at Israeli troops. Residents of the Rafah camp threw
stones at tanks before the Palestinian police arrived to confront the Israelis. Of course,
we all know how disappointed the Israelis must have been that they didn&#146;t have the
chance to shoot more of your children. But, hey, you&#146;ll laugh when you hear what
Gissin said. He stated that when little kids throw stones at heavily armed Israeli
soldiers, they pose a threat to the security of Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Good morning, Rafah. Good morning to those of you who lived through the
ground assault, the demolition of your houses and the shells, missiles and machine-gun
fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Have you ever noticed that the bullets that Israelis kill us with are made
in the USA? Talk about complicity. Talk about justice. Talk about the U.S. Congressmen
being mad at us because we don&#146;t just let the Israelis kill us without making a fuss
about it all. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Evil Reincarnated made a recent statement that peace talks would not
resume until calm is restored completely. People, you gotta be calm! Don&#146;t be
violent. Remember you are violent when you sit quietly in your homes or when your children
play in the streets or when you refuse to let the Israelis shoot you point blank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Evil has set 3 national goals for the people of Israel: One, to bring
in a million Jews over the next 12 years; two, to develop the Negev; and three, to
revitalize Zionist values in education. Peace is no longer a word in his limited
vocabulary. What he does best anyway is slaughter Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If we cease our &#147;hostile acts,&#148; then Evil himself will offer us
42% of what is left of our occupied territories. The settlements will, of course, remain
on what is left of our land. Naturally, this will be for the purposes of
&#147;security&#148; and to contain us natives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Good morning, Palestine. I hope you are enjoying my show. It&#146;s great
to be alive, isn&#146;t it? Enough small talk here on my part. Let&#146;s get the music
rolling. The first song I&#146;m going to play is, &#147;It&#146;s Gonna Be Me.&#148; I
think this is very appropriate since it&#146;s gonna be us who keep dying while the
Israelis and Americans point their fingers at us accusing us of terrorism while the real
terrorists are ploughing us under the ground.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israel commemorates Nazi holocaust while carrying
<br>
out its own holocaust against the Palestinian people</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Palestine- From Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Thursday, 19 April, Israel commemorated &#147;the holocaust&#148; in
which we are told six million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis. And, as in every year,
the Zionist propaganda-mill in Palestine and abroad bombards the world with an unceasing
and unrelenting stream of onerous messages, all for the purpose of &#147;perpetuating the
holocaust memory in the collective consciousness of the world,&#148; as Israeli President
Moshe Katsav was quoted as saying.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This year, the &#147;holocaust memorial day&#148; occurred in the midst of
a genocidal war launched by the Jews against the Palestinian people as a whole in which
state-of-the-art American weapons are used to inflict death and havoc on the already
tormented Palestinians, whose only &#147;crime&#148; is simply their unconquerable desire
to be free of Israel&#146;s military occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the brutality and utter callousness of Israeli repression, which
often transcends reality, is pushing many Palestinians and non-Palestinians to draw an
analogy between &#147;the German holocaust against Jews and the Jewish holocaust against
Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, when the Israeli occupation army besieged Palestinian population
centres, including small hamlets, throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, some
unsophisticated villagers spoke rather spontaneously of Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron as
becoming modern-day Auschwitzes, Treblinkas and Bergen Belsens.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One villager from Beit Fureik, outside Nablus, who was shot at by the
occupation soldiers while venturing to sneak to the nearest grocery store to buy milk for
his crying baby, was quoted as saying, &#147;Our villages have become like concentration
camps; the only thing missing is the gas chambers.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I understand that the growing comparisons of &#147;the Jewish-perpetrated
holocaust against the Palestinians&#148; with &#147;the Nazi holocaust against Jews&#148;
is likely to be dismissed as &#147;exaggerated,&#148; maybe even a little
&#147;far-fetched&#148; by the Zionist-influenced media in the West, particularly in the
United States where the cardinal charge of anti-Semitism is thrown in the face of everyone
criticizing the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, a close and objective examination of Israeli torment of
Palestinian civilians during the last seven months reveals that drawing an analogy between
Nazi treatment of Jews and Jewish Zionist treatment of Palestinians is anything but
&#147;far-fetched&#148; both at the practical and theoretical levels.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Take, for example, the numerous &#147;incidents&#148; in which Jewish
settlers carried out &#147;killing parties&#148; against Palestinian farmers in the West
Bank. There is irrefutable evidence that Jewish settlers in the northern part of the West
Bank abducted, tortured and ceremonially killed Palestinian farmers and, in a number of
cases, children, too, in full view of Jewish youngsters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The presence of the Jewish children and youths in these &#147;killing
parties&#148; was apparently meant to embolden them and make them unafraid of Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such was the case with Farid Nasasreh, who was murdered in his field at
the village of Beit Fureik, near Nablus, on 18 October.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Scores of other Palestinian civilians were murdered in a similar fashion,
with none of the murderers prosecuted or even arrested.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the hermetic siege and encirclement of Palestinian population
centres for six months now, which effectively turned these towns and villages into giant
detention centres, or &#147;concentration camps,&#148; is hardly an un-Nazi practice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The utter destruction of Palestinian residential homes, farmland,
orchards, vineyards and agricultural crops, in utter violation of every human, moral, or
legal consideration, does underscore a profoundly racist mentality that views
&#147;non-Jews&#148; as lesser or sub-human beings whose lives are expendable at best.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is amply clear that these horrendous crimes, while perpetrated in the
context of a politically motivated genocide against the native Palestinians, are
inevitably manifestations of an insidiously racist mentality, not unlike that of the
Nazis. The brutal ugliness in both cases is striking, indeed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the racist underpinning of Zionist atrocities against the
defenceless Palestinian civilians is publicly rife and privately rampant among most Jews
in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Take, for example, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the Shas
religious political party, the third largest party in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few weeks ago, while giving a Pessach (Passover) sermon in West
Jerusalem, he, rather nonchalantly and without any grudges, called for the &#147;utter
annihilation of all Arabs and the extermination of their seed from the face of
earth.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last year, the same man, considered among the &#147;greatest&#148; living
sages of the Talmud, labelled Arabs as &#147;snakes.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is more worrying though is the fact that Yosef&#146;s venomous ideas
are not viewed as abnormal or immoral by the bulk of the Israeli Jewish society.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eli Yeshi, Israel&#146;s Interior Minister, who also heads the Shas
faction in the Knesset, strongly defended Yosef&#146;s remarks, which he said
&#147;represent the prevailing state of thinking within the Israeli Jewish society.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, this means that Jewish racism, or for that matter, Jewish
Nazism, is as popular among Jews these days as Hitler&#146;s Mein Kampf was among Germans
in the 1930s.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This Nazism, of which authentic Judaism is completely innocent, is readily
adopted and celebrated by most present-day Israeli political leaders, from Rahba&#146;am
Zevei, who calls for the total expulsion of all non-Jews from the &#147;land of
Israel&#148;, to Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize laureate who on 18 April 1996 ordered the
notorious massacre of over a hundred Lebanese children and women at Qana in South Lebanon,
without the slightest gesture of regret or remorse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the Zionist perception of Palestinians as
&#147;two-legged animals&#148; or &#147;cockroaches&#148; or &#147;scum, vermin and dirty
animals that ought to be exterminated,&#148; as the infamous Menachem Begin once referred
to Palestinian refugees, is not merely a reaction to Palestinian resistance to the Zionist
onslaught, as some na�ve Americans would think.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is actually, and in a fundamental way, a reflection of Zionist belief
of racial superiority that is enshrined in school textbooks and expressed in the daily
atrocities perpetrated so callously and so readily against innocent Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, when a Jewish settler schoolchild was asked by CNN why he was
harassing Palestinian schoolchildren walking by the settlement, near Nablus, while on
their way to school, he said, &#147;They are animals; we must kill them.&#148; One could
have a fair guess of what kind of upbringing this child has had, what kind of school
curriculum he studies!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is sad, really sad, that the Jews, perhaps most Jews, have chosen this
unethical and extremely evil way to achieve &#147;national fulfilment.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Harry Truman, the American President who was instrumental in creating
Israel, once said, &#147;Jews are like all underdogs&#150;when they get on the top, they
become as savage and merciless to their victims as their former oppressors were to them
when they were underneath.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, Truman&#146;s visionary statements are being validated, not
only by the diabolical statements of the likes of Ovadia Yosef, Ze&#146;evi and Liberman,
but also mainly by the beastly crimes of the Israeli occupation soldiers and marauding
Jewish settlers in the streets and fields of the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aren&#146;t the Zionists worried that their neo-Nazism might eventually
recoil on them as did Arian Nazism on the Germans?</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">After seven months of intifada, do Israelis know
what they want?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the Arab summit conference in Amman concluded with a set of
ineffective resolutions last March, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have been on
the receiving end of Israeli bombardment. Houses, offices and hospitals are among the
targets. The weaponry used includes bulldozers, machine-guns, tanks, artillery, gunboats
and Apache helicopters. By also targeting the offices and headquarters of some Palestinian
Authority (PA) security agencies, it is evident that the Israelis are desperate. Their
punitive measures are aimed at forcing the PA to contain the situation in Palestinian
towns, villages and camps in the West Bank and Gaza and to comply with Israeli conditions
for the resumption of peace talks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps the Israelis believe they can do to the PA what they did to the
PLO previously in Lebanon. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the early 1980s led to a
series of defeats suffered by the PLO all the way from the south of Lebanon to Beirut. The
Israeli campaign eventually succeeded in the expulsion of the PLO from the whole of
Lebanon. The brutal use of force against PA institutions in the West Bank and Gaza is
probably aimed at warning the PA that it has no option but to comply. Obviously, the
objective of the Israelis could not be the destruction of the PA altogether; it would be
insane to do so without securing an alternative partner in the urgently needed
&#145;peace-making&#146; process. Such an alternative is clearly unavailable for no
Palestinian today would want to be seen as doing Israel&#146;s dirty work on its behalf.
Today, even the PA is under enormous pressure from the Palestinian public as well as from
its own Fatah cadres to no longer give in to the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having failed to quell the first intifada, which erupted in December 1987,
&#145;peace-making&#146; has, since the early 1990s, been an Israeli requirement. But the
Israelis, thanks to unconditional U.S. support on the one hand and PA acquiescence on the
other, have grown increasingly arrogant and choosy. They have been allowed, at least until
the eruption of the second intifada last September, to dictate the terms of peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the Israelis delude themselves if they think that the exit from their
predicament lies in doing to the PA today what they did to the PLO in the past. The
Palestinians who are being bombarded today in Gaza and the West Bank are not guests in
somebody else&#146;s land. They clearly have nowhere else to go and they definitely intend
not to allow the Israelis to uproot them from their land. Had the PA been the source of
Israeli discomfort, and had getting rid of it been a solution to today&#146;s problem, the
Israelis would have easily done away with it. The real confrontation is with the people
who have been there all along and who were the promoters of both <i>intifadas</i>.
Furthermore, the PA is not composed simply of the Tunisian PLO&#150;Arafat and his close
associates&#150;that came into the land as a result of &#145;peace-making&#146;. The local
cadres of Fatah, who have been a principal element of both <i>intifadas</i>, constitute
the backbone of the PA without whom it simply has no existence. Inasmuch as the PLO has
contributed to the corruption of social, political and economic aspects of life in the
West Bank and Gaza, the institutions it has set up for the purpose of
&#145;peace-making&#146; have gradually adopted domestic characters and dimensions and
cannot thus be easily extricated from local life. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What the Israelis seem to need is more time to learn that no matter what
oppressive measures they adopt against the Palestinians, terror only begets terror. In
view of their experience in Lebanon, one would have expected the Israelis to grow wiser.
But not only did Israelis find difficulty understanding this but also the Western world
seems more confused than ever. And that is not because of lack of coverage of the events
in Palestine, but because of lack of well-informed objective analysis of these events.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Western media, which reflects Western concern that the peace process
may have completely collapsed, cannot afford to ignore developments in Palestine. However,
the media usually reports savagery in the Holy Land with little, if any, meaningful
explanation. The merciless, sometimes indiscriminate, Israeli bombardment of the civilian
Palestinian population under siege in their own land is alleged to be in response to
Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets. Not only is little information given about the
roots of the conflict, very little attention is paid to the fact that Israeli military
occupation is what provokes the Palestinians in the very first place. No mention is made
of the fact that despite seven years of &#145;peace-making&#146;, Palestinians have
continued to be killed almost on a daily basis, their houses continued to be demolished
and their land confiscated. No reference is made to the fact that Jewish settlers, who are
a constant reminder to the Palestinians of the theft perpetrated against them, continue to
violate Palestinian rights with impunity benefiting from a cover of blessing and
protection rendered to them by Israeli politicians and effected on the ground by Israeli
occupation troops. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As seen by Western eyes, this is a vicious cycle of violence and
counter-violence. Indeed, this is what it exactly is. Especially since the end of
September, Israelis and Palestinians have been engaged in one of the most unconventional
battles in the history of the region. Provoked by occupation, humiliation and oppression,
Palestinians fight back throwing stones at first but eventually resorting to the only
truly lethal weapon available to them, human bombs. Israeli politicians, under pressure
from a confused and panicking public that has been promised security and peace of mind,
retaliate by ordering the unleashing of a barrage of lethal weapons from amongst the most
advanced U.S.-made death and destruction-causing technology made unconditionally available
to them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a pathetic response to Palestinian suffering and Israeli savagery, the
Arab summit conference in Amman had nothing to offer save a few words of sympathy and a
decision to pay the PA a few million dollars a month to enable it to pay the salaries of
its employees, who have not been paid for months as a result of Israel&#146;s withholding
of tax receipts due to the PA as stipulated by previous agreements. In fact, not much more
could be expected from the Arab leaders who, as usual, came to the summit carrying with
them the bitter experiences of the past decades. Perhaps only those who have only recently
joined the political club in the Arab region, namely King Abdullah II of Jordan and
President Bashar of Syria, were not burdened by the past. As for the others, they were so
divided over so many issues that apart from speaking one language (literally speaking),
there seemed to be nothing else in common among them. Arabs may hope for a better Arab
summit meeting when more new faces occupy the front seats in the conference hall. This is
not likely to take long since most of the current occupants are so archaic and have been
waiting to take the next train out of their station.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No better example explains the impact of the burden of the past, which
today translates into personal incompatibility and conflict-on-sight, than the impasse
over the question of sanctions imposed on Iraq. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, over the issue of Palestine, it is not this burden of bitterness
and hatred that is standing in the way of meaningful action. Arab governments continue to
live in a state of utter fear from Israel and the United States of America. The ruling
elite in every one of these countries has grown to be so modernist that faith plays no
role in their thinking. They are so captivated by the power of the prevailing world order
that nothing else contributes to their vision of the future. Thus, the increasingly
widening gap between the masses and those who govern them in the Arab region. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In spite of a century of modernization (a combination of both
secularization and Westernization), the Muslim peoples of the world do not share the fears
of their rulers. They look up to examples of history, both ancient and recent, where truth
and justice won the battle against falsehood and oppression despite the seeming inequality
of opportunity and apparent imbalance of power. In a nutshell, the masses are eager to
fight while the rulers hate to hear the word &#145;jihad&#146;. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The plight of the Palestinians is augmented by the lack of official Arab
action in their support. Arab rulers, in their summit conferences as well as in various
political manoeuvrings, are primarily concerned with preventing a spill-over that may lead
to an escalation, which may in turn end up in a regional conflict. They are so defeated,
morally, that they do not doubt for a minute that Israel has the power to win any war
against the Arabs even if they were to stand united against it. It is no wonder that many
Israelis feel reassured that the Arabs outside Palestine post no real threat to them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli attack on a Syrian radar station in Lebanon, with the clear
intention of forcing Syria to emasculate Hizbullah, could not have taken place had the
Arabs been sending nothing but conciliatory gestures to the Israelis. There is hardly much
Syria can do on its own and the Israelis know this all too well. Other Arabs may join the
Americans and Europeans in calling on all parties to exercise self-restraint, but no more.
The Israelis could easily be deterred only if the Arab countries bordering Palestine were
to relax their border control. Millions of Arabs and Muslims would be willing to offer
themselves for what they consider to be the noblest of all causes. Experience has proven
beyond doubt that Israeli military might is rendered ineffective in the face of guerrilla
warfare. If Arab armies are not ready to deter Israel yet, opening the borders for those
longing for martyrdom will turn the lives of Israelis into hell. Then and only then may
Israeli leaders think twice, and perhaps more than twice, before they attack Palestinian
or Arab targets. </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Dr. Hanan Ashrawi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While the current Palestinian-Israeli crisis threatens to spin out of
control drawing both peoples and the region as a whole towards a new cycle of unbridled
conflict, it has already generated sufficient &#147;spin&#148; and verbal distortions that
have become a dangerous component of and motivation for violence. <br>
<br>
The issue is not that of &#147;the chicken or the egg&#148; question, but one of a
self-feeding and self-fulfilling dynamic: mindsets and attitudes determine the nature of
the discourse and public debate, while public utterances and presentations are
simultaneously the forces that shape perceptions and outlooks. <br>
<br>
To the Palestinians, the intifada is an expression of the most basic reality of a people
under occupation and their desire for freedom, dignity, and sovereignty; as such it is an
uprising that represents a human will to endure, to resist, and to reject enslavement and
brutality. It is a fundamental cry for justice and dignity. <br>
<br>
Hence, to many Palestinians it is inexplicable that in most Israeli public discourse the
issue has reverted to the fundamental question of survival and a return to the existential
issue of Israel&#146;s right to exist as a Jewish state. The &#147;legitimacy&#148; of
Israel debate and its acceptance by the Arab world (let alone its regional integration) is
once again being brandished as a motivation for the return to the &#147;beleaguered&#148;
or &#147;fortress&#148; mentality in Israel. The subsequent &#147;closing of ranks&#148;
represented by the current hard-line coalition government in Israel is simultaneously an
outcome of this mentality and the major driving force behind its policies, while the
government itself is directly perpetuating the mindset of insecurity and hostility to
serve its own ideology and longevity. <br>
<br>
Totally absent from this deceptive paradigm are several essential facts that have shaped
contemporary Palestinian realities and political strategies. The most significant of these
is the Palestine National Council resolution of November 15, 1988 (motivated primarily by
the previous Palestinian intifada in the Occupied Territories) accepting the partition of
historical Palestine and recognizing the two-state solution, hence recognizing Israel. <br>
<br>
Another turning point was the commitment to the terms of reference of the Madrid Peace
Process, particularly UN resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace formula. To the
Palestinians, the historical compromise of accepting the June 4, 1967 boundaries (i.e. 22%
of historical Palestine) has never been fully appreciated by Israel and its allies; in
addition, it constitutes the minimal requirement for a viable state and consequently for a
lasting peace. Any further loss of land would render both statehood and peace
unattainable. Claiming all of historical Palestine or even the Partition Plan of 1947 for
the nascent Palestinian state, let alone denying Israel&#146;s existence, has long been
dropped from Palestinian discourse and policy. Israel&#146;s shortsighted and dangerous
attempts at reviving past questions of legitimacy and survival could become a
self-fulfilling prophecy by resurrecting such elemental questions among
Palestinian&#151;and Arab&#151;public opinion. <br>
<br>
Another absent factor is the existence of signed agreements that are legally binding on
all parties, including interim agreements with the Palestinians and peace accords with two
Arab states&#151;Egypt and Jordan. A partial negation of realities and obligations
vis-�-vis the Palestinians is liable to encompass the rest, particularly within the Arab
and regional Palestinian context. If Israel is seeking to isolate and &#147;defeat&#148;
the Palestinians, it will only destabilize the whole region and jeopardize security on all
fronts, including its own. <br>
<br>
A revival of individual fear and insecurity, along with hostility towards and distrust of
all Arabs and Muslims (directed most immediately towards the Palestinians), has been a
major political instrument of extremist right wing governments in Israel. Its moral
repugnancy is compounded particularly when employed as a means of maintaining control
through the politics of fear and insecurity. An anachronistic regression to the most
ardent Zionist ideology is finding expression both in the dangerous expanded land
confiscation and settlement drive as well as in the resurgence of undisguised racist
formulations on demography as a means of legitimizing ethnic cleansing advocating forced
birth control among the Palestinians and collective expulsions of Palestinians from both
Israel and the West Bank. While most Israelis had viewed such schemes previously as being
evil and unconscionable, they are now being thinly disguised as pseudo-respectable
&#147;academic&#148; studies in defense of purist Zionism (cf. Interdisciplinary
Center&#146;s conference on Israeli National Security, Hertzelia, March 2001). <br>
<br>
The manipulation of facts and a mindless repetition of misleading &#147;spin&#148; and
processed language to hammer home a message of evasion of responsibility and misplaced
allocation of blame compound the present danger. The orchestrated rhetoric of labels,
mudslinging, and dehumanization is being exploited by the Sharon government and its hyper
active PR machine as a convenient and self-serving political tool. In the long run,
however, it is serving only to destroy the very foundations on which peace is to be built.
If bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes and building illegal Israeli settlements are
responsible for destroying the chances of peace on the ground, Israeli official rhetoric
and rationalizations are destroying the logic of peace in the minds of both peoples. <br>
<br>
Within this mental-verbal political context, it has become convenient and facile to
mislead the Israelis with the representation (and perception) of the intifada as a form of
gratuitous &#147;violence&#148; threatening the very existence of their state, let alone
their personal security. Equally cynical is the depiction of previous Israeli proposals in
the context of the peace process as a &#147;generous offer&#148; or
&#147;concessions&#148; handed down from the strong to the weak, and somehow inexplicably
rejected by those ungrateful Palestinians. In reality the Israeli &#147;generous
offer&#148; meant granting Israel license to annex Palestinian land including most of
occupied Jerusalem, to maintain settlement clusters that destroy the territorial unity of
the West Bank and the viability of the Palestinian state, to abolish the Palestinian
refugees&#146; right of return, to maintain Israeli security control and diminish
Palestinian sovereignty, and to violate international law and UN resolutions. <br>
<br>
Similarly, the misrepresentation of the intifada as an immediate and
&#147;orchestrated&#148; resort to &#147;violence&#148; betrays a total lack of awareness
of Palestinian conditions and the build-up of pain and anger at the continued
victimization of the Palestinians in the course of a severely flawed peace process. To the
Palestinians, the peace process had become a punitive process and an instrument of power
politics designed to perpetuate their subjugation and Israel&#146;s control and
domination. Thus, it represented an absence of political will and a weakness in the moral
fiber of Israel and the international community, particularly in their blatant disregard
of international law and Palestinian rights. By refusing to acknowledge (and deal with)
legitimate Palestinian grievances and Israeli excesses, Israel not only indulged in
willful ignorance, but also compounded the injustice and persistently brought about the
current tragic breakdown. <br>
<br>
A steady supply of official Israeli erroneous justifications and deceptive
rationalizations (including blaming the victim), served only to deepen hostilities and
distortions. Also conveniently, it afforded the Israeli government a cheap means for the
evasion of responsibility and accountability, with the Palestinians somehow
&#147;deservedly&#148; bringing upon themselves the full force of Israeli military
assaults while the Israeli army engaged in &#147;self defense.&#148; By the same illogic,
&#147;defending&#148; the settlement of Psagot by shelling Palestinian homes and
terrorizing whole families living in Ramallah-Bireh became synonymous with
&#147;defending&#148; Tel Aviv and Haifa. Similarly, the siege and starvation of the
Palestinian people became the justifiable price that the Palestinians had to pay for their
insubordination, ingratitude, and &#147;terrorism.&#148; Assassinations, extra-judicial
killings, and cold-blooded murder were &#147;legitimized&#148; as safeguards not only for
the personal security of every individual Israeli but also for the survival of the state
itself. <br>
All the while, and with the relentless battering of the captive Palestinian population,
the refrain &#147;Stop the Violence!&#148; hammered the Palestinians with painful
monotony. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, the essential fact of the occupation itself has been eradicated from the
discourse and the blame-game. Sharon&#146;s insistence on the language and tactics of
&#147;war&#148; not only created the grand deception, but also provided him with the
elements and cover for his anti-peace policies. His objective of achieving a &#147;state
of non-belligerency&#148; and a prolonged transitional phase with the Palestinians once
they &#147;stop the violence,&#148; is an attempt at normalizing and perpetuating the
occupation by bringing about Palestinian acquiescence and submission to the fact of the
occupation through military repression. The false symmetry in the illusion of
&#147;warring parties&#148; also disguises the imbalance of power while justifying the
&#147;rules of engagement&#148; fallacy that transforms every Palestinian into a
legitimate target as a potential &#147;combatant.&#148; The Palestinians are thus
instantly robbed of their humanity, their civilian status, the protection of the law
(particularly international humanitarian law), the safety of moral norms, and the fact of
their own victimization and suffering. <br>
<br>
Such political and verbal machinations may serve to deceive international public opinion
for a while; ultimately, however, they will backfire within Israel. The patronizing
&#147;disappointment&#148; of some members of the Israeli &#147;peace camp&#148; at the
Palestinian unwillingness to fit their preconceptions of a unilateral peace, or to play
the &#147;grateful native&#148; role, or to acknowledge the Israeli version of
&#147;what&#146;s good for them&#148; has (wittingly or not) played into the hands of the
Sharon&#146;s, Lieberman&#146;s, and Ze&#146;evi&#146;s of the Israeli government by
providing justifications and fanning the flames of extremism while legitimizing
Palestinian-bashing as a national pastime. Generating a culture of fear and distrust, with
the inevitable claim to impunity and rejection of accountability, will not only taint
Israel&#146;s moral fiber; it will also demolish the requisite bridges that must be built
between both peoples to maintain the prospects of future peace despite the current chasm. <br>
<br>
Ultimately, once the dust settles and sanity is restored, there will be a need for
interlocutors and constituencies for peace on both sides. Beyond ideology, racism,
extremism, and militarization, a negotiated peaceful settlement is the only solution.
Rather than indulging in the negation of the other, each side must engage in the process
of rehumanizing the other. The painstaking and painful dialogue of the 1970&#146;s and
1980&#146;s provided a successful antidote to the then prevailing politics of hate. It
also legitimized negotiations and prepared both publics for a culture of mutuality and
inclusive politics (thus launching the Madrid process in 1991 in the midst of the earlier
intifada). It became evident then, as it must be now, that there is no military solution.
As one chapter in a predominantly painful history, it must not be driven out of our
collective memory by the revival of past mindsets of absolutism and hate. Sharon and his
partners must not be given the mandate to destroy the future with the worst policies and
rhetoric of the past. If anyone must succumb to the urge to go back to the basics, what
can be more basic than the essential humanity and equality of rights of all peoples and
individuals? </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Revisiting &#147;The Other Exodus&#148; in <br>
Europe&#146;s Media: from Childers to Black </font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Forty years ago an Irish journalist, Erskine Childers, wrote a memorable
article entitled, &#147;The Other Exodus&#148; in the London weekly <i>The Spectator</i>
(12 May 1961). It provoked a bitter controversy that continued well into August 1961. Two
key points lay at the core of Mr. Childers&#146; investigation. First, that the
Palestinians did not leave their homes at the orders of Arab leaders, as professed by
Israel. And secondly, that &#147;official Zionist forces were responsible for the
expulsion of thousands upon thousands of Arabs, and for deliberate incitement to
panic.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the time of its writing, <i>The Spectator</i> was owned by the
distinguished British scholar Ian Gilmour now (Lord) director of the Middle East
International. Unlike many of the mainstream newspapers and magazines, it used to publish
the views of writers across the political spectrum, including Zionists and anti-Zionists
alike. Today, things have changed drastically. Since its take-over by the Canadian media
magnate, Conrad Black, <i>The Spectator&#146;s</i> reputation as a symbol of critical
inquiry and free speech has become a relic of the past. The new proprietor, who also owns
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in Britain and the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>, abhors any opinion
that questions Israel&#146;s maltreatment of the Palestinian people. Hence, when one of
the magazine&#146;s lead writers, Taki Theodoracopulos, recently penned a piece expressing
dismay over &#147;those nice guys who attack rock-throwing youths with armour-piercing
missiles,&#148; he incurred the unbridled wrath of Mr. Black who condemned his article as
&#147;almost worthy of Goebbels.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the expulsion of 805,065 Palestinians had brought shame &#147;beyond
all brief description&#148; to Childers and other Westerners decades ago, so too
Israel&#146;s repression of resistance in the occupied territories and refusal to allow
Palestinian repatriation has today stirred the consciences of lead columnists in the
European media. Notwithstanding traditional tendencies to confine the Palestinian issue to
the more obscure columns of their newspapers, British journalists have since September
2000 been forced to give the issue more prominent coverage. With respect to <i>The
Spectator</i>, it was, of course, the least expected to publish anything remotely critical
of Israeli policies. Under its current ownership it has shown an insatiable appetite for
the racist stereotypes of Palestinians, which have been a hallmark of recent disclosures
by senior Israeli politicians, rabbis and U.S. Congressional leaders, even though the
Palestinian Arabs are themselves a Semitic people.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Turn the aggressor into victim</u> </b><br>
Even in the face of slurs such as &#147;vile and primitive,&#148; &#147;snakes and
scorpions,&#148; the Palestinians never accepted the inferior status ascribed to them by
the Occupying Power. Strengthened by the violence of their colonizer, they have, instead,
rebelled against all attempts to deny their humanity and freedom. From the earliest days
of exile to the present, they were enlightened by the fact that no measure of force or
deception could legitimize Israel&#146;s occupation of their homeland. Similarly, they are
neither deterred nor disheartened by the international media coverage that seeks to
portray Israel as an innocent victim threatened with destruction and not as an Occupying
Power that refuses to relinquish territories acquired by force. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Childers wrote about &#147;The Other Exodus,&#148; his was an attempt
to break the immoral silence on the Palestinian Catastrophe in the Western media. A few
years earlier, in 1954, a conference organized by the International Press Institute in
Zurich recorded that when it came to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the press displayed a
level of apathy that was unthinkable in its coverage of other issues. Nowadays, the
challenge facing writers is not just to break that wall of silence. It is, more
importantly, one of telling the truth about Palestine. All too often they are caught
between the two contradictory demands of telling the truth on the one hand and covering up
the lie on the other. A classic example is the claim that there would have been no
refugees if the Arab States did not attack the Jewish State on 15 May 1948, even though
800,000 Palestinians were already expelled before that date.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Commenting on the role of truth in the anti-colonialist struggle, Frantz
Fanon, the West Indian veteran of the Algerian war of liberation, observed, &#147;In every
age, among the people, truth is the property of the national cause&#133;Truth is that
which hurries on the break-up of the colonialist regime; it is that which promotes the
emergence of the nation; it is all that protects the natives, and ruins the
foreigners.&#148; In the Palestinian context, telling the truth is not, however, the sole
responsibility of the media. Decision makers who buried their heads in the sand for years
like the proverbial ostrich must also act decisively to stop the inhuman conduct of
Israel&#146;s military occupation. While many choose to express their horror in private, a
courageous minority believe it is their duty to speak out, even if it means breaking
ranks. Denmark&#146;s Foreign Minister Mogens Lykketoft demonstrated this last March when
he gave notice that he would raise the question of imposing sanctions against Israel when
the European Union foreign ministers next meet. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For all its worth, isolated outbursts of indignation or donations of
emergency aid would not deliver the suffering humanity in Palestine. They must be
converted into real policies that reflect Palestinian hopes and aspirations&#150;to be
free of foreign domination, to regain control over their own land and its resources, and
to determine their future as a reunited people without external interference. How many
times has it been said of the colonized that they prefer hunger with dignity than bread
eaten in slavery? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>There is no benevolent occupation </u></b><br>
If ever there was any doubt in international public opinion about Israel&#146;s intentions
in the past, there could be no excuse for such illusions at present. Not contented with
the gains of military conquests in 1948 and 1967, the Jewish State is now making a final
onslaught to secure maximum advantage at the human level. The fate of the Palestinians who
remained in what became Israel is no better than those who were made internal refugees in
the West Bank and Gaza or the millions languishing abroad. In a country that enjoys one of
the highest living standards in the world, one in every two Palestinians in Israel lives
below the poverty line. Though comprising 20% of the country&#146;s population, they
receive a paltry 0.5% of the national budget. Over the last six years unemployment among
Palestinian academics has risen by 88%. Surely it cannot be an accident that there are
only four Palestinian Arab employees in the Israeli Ministry of Trade out of a total of
540; or that 23 of the 26 towns with the highest unemployment rate in Israel are
Palestinian. If this is not apartheid, then what is?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even with these built-in disabilities, Israeli policy makers still view
the Palestinians as a threat. Former Defence Force intelligence supremo, Shlomo Gazait
warned of the &#147;demographic danger&#148; caused by Israelis&#146; inability to match
the higher reproduction rate among Palestinians. Addressing a Jewish Agency Zionist
Council conference last March, Gazait said, &#147;The demographic danger is the most
serious danger facing Israel today. If we don&#146;t come to our senses on this issue and
don&#146;t take proper steps immediately, then within one generation, or at most two, the
State of Israel will cease to exist as a Jewish Zionist State.&#148; The best way to
confront this situation, he advised, was to abandon all pretenses to democracy and
establish a &#147;dictatorship for a couple of years.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Back in Europe, a leading German newspaper, <i>Sueddeutsche</i>, published
an article on 4 April by a prominent Middle East specialist, Dietur Wild, recalling
opinions expressed by the Israeli leftist, Haatis Ruliif, ten years ago during the first
intifada when she said that &#147;the only way out of the current crisis is the way of
disaster, and perhaps it is necessary that we commit suicide as was done in East
Germany.&#148; Wild analysed the notion of national suicide against the background of
changes in Israel&#146;s political map. He pointed out that the Zionist alternative to
Europe&#146;s Jewish problem has itself ended in failure since Palestine has proven not to
be a place of safety and security for the Jews. In the end, Wild concludes that the
intifada may not only lead to Israel&#146;s loss of its image of invincibility but even to
its actual defeat at the end of the day.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Desperate solutions for desperate people</u></b><br>
Wild dreams? Perhaps not, especially after Sharon has, on his part, called for a return to
the policies of Ben Gurion. This was his message to Israelis at a recent function in
honour of former presidents and prime ministers. From a Palestinian point of view, such an
eventuality can only mean one thing: giving more teeth to the draconian basic laws like
the Absentee Property Laws, Law of Return and Nationality Laws, all of which seek to solve
Israel&#146;s demographic problem through the dispossession and permanent exile of
Palestinians. Having tried these methods and failed, other elements in the establishment
prefer even more drastic measures, including the forced restriction of the birth rate
among Palestinians. Chairman of the Arab Council of Science, Medicine and Technology,
Subhi Shalash, has already accused Israel of using debilitating gases in the occupied
territories to prevent procreation among Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These are desperate people living in desperate times. They are prepared to
adopt the most desperate of methods to achieve their objectives. That Israelis should
resort to a discredited former general to lead them out of the current quagmire is
evidence enough. But if he could not break their will 50 years ago when he was in the
prime of his youth and the world&#146;s media was prepared to turn a blind eye on his
outrages, it is highly unlikely that he would ever succeed today. Not in an age when war
criminals are called to book by a world conscience that has grown weary of human
suffering. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel may delay the liberation of Palestine but it cannot stop it.
Decolonization is always successful. No people are ever satisfied with the humiliation and
indignity that accompanies the loss of their homeland. They always prefer the glory and
honour that come with its liberation. Of course there will be many more losses before this
chapter of colonial rule is closed. Zionist occupation will become more brutal, bloody and
desperate. There will be more massacres, dislocation, and expansion of settlements, albeit
under the guise of &#147;natural growth needs,&#148; to quote Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres. But as Dietur Wild pointed out in <i>Sueddeutsche</i>, Israel is no longer what
former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale claimed it to be: a carrier of American planes
that cannot be sunk. The future is bleak for the Jewish State. Wild says it will certainly
lose the coming war because &#147;whereas it became accustomed to victories over regular
Arab armies, this is not the case with armies of stone-throwing youths.&#148; The message
to world leaders is clear and simple. There could be no peace in our region until you deal
with our conflict as a problem to be solved and not as a means to economic gain and
strategic advantage.</p>

Free Genocide Vs. Free Trade</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>An evil had never been so ambitious in its scope, so
systematic in its execution and so deliberate in its destruction.&#148; - President Bush
after touring the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on the occasion of Holocaust Memorial
Day.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush could easily have been speaking about Zionism and Sharon&#146;s plan
not to leave a Palestinian alive and not to leave an inch of Holy Land soil unturned and
bulldozed; he could easily have been speaking about the damage of the Israeli lobby on
America&#146;s democracy and political independence; he could easily have been speaking
about the American media&#146;s parroting and pandering to Israel&#146;s objectives; he
could easily have been speaking about America&#146;s short-sighted foreign policy whose
objectives are to support Israel at all costs and to enrich the military-industrial
complex; he could easily have been speaking about the tragic silence of Americans,
Europeans, the United Nations and freedom-loving people around the world regarding
Israel&#146;s daily massacres of humans, homes, olive groves, water diversion, and soil in
Palestine; and he surely would be correct if he was referring to the impotence and silence
of the Arab/Islamic leaders against Israel&#146;s aggression and American support. The
Palestinians you see are not on the mental and emotional agenda of the world. The world is
content to sacrifice them for Hitler&#146;s genocide. Their genocide in the Holy Land is
the atonement for Hitler&#146;s sins, and their blood washes the sin and guilt of America
and Europe. It&#146;s <i>d�j� vu</i> all over again. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lately, reality programmes are thriving on American television. They are
cheap to produce, cheap to distribute, and return huge profits to such broadcasters as
ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX. It&#146;s depressing to think that these &#147;reality&#148; shows
reflect America&#146;s reality. In essence, that would define the &#147;reality&#148; of
America as being a society of liars, back-stabbers, and competitive hounds where the ends
justify the means; a sex-crazed society deliberately tempted to commit adultery; a society
where alcohol and drugs absolve and soothe sin and guilt; a society preoccupied with
&#147;self&#148; indifferent to &#147;others,&#148; a society where reality is contrived
and manipulated by executives, producers, directors and writers. Are we thus as Americans
simply thrown into a Gladiator arena to fight among ourselves for &#147;Survival&#148; of
the fittest to please the devilish media warlords without any physical freedom or
intellectual independence? They already decide what we read, see, eat, drink, smoke, wear,
drive, buy, sell, and how we reproduce; they offer us our morning conversation and gossip,
our &#147;behaviour and topic <i>du jour</i>&#148;, but most importantly they offer us our
thoughts, opinions, voting patterns and distractions. In essence, these media warlords
decide America&#146;s political, economic and social agenda. American independence and
morality: FORGET ABOUT IT!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America is wired and plugged in to the information age. From the wireless
satellites to the millions of miles of cable, American free thought has been usurped by
the media mafia that ensures that every American is entitled to &#147;their&#148; opinion.
Five media warlords determine our thought and speech content, determine who&#146;s allowed
to speak and who&#146;s thought they print, who&#146;s accepted and who&#146;s not, and
who&#146;s been naughty and nice. Our populace and politicians live and die according to a
preconceived media agenda. Image, not content, is everything. The worst murderer in
history can be repackaged, rehabilitated, marketed and enriched by book and movie deals.
In America, if it ain&#146;t on TV, it didn&#146;t happen and it ain&#146;t real. In
America, no one succeeds without placing their life and soul in the hands of the handlers,
not in the &#147;hands of the man who crossed the water.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America is proud of its new independence call: &#147;Give me TV or give me
death.&#148; Ratings and not the Constitution or the Bill of Rights determines our
freedoms and liberties. The movie metaphor for the American life is the Schwartzneggar
movie, &#147;The Running Man.&#148; Only in America can an alien-looking movie actor from
Austria&#150;Schwartzneggar, whose claim to fame is biceps, bad English, and killing Arab
&#147;terrorists&#148;&#150;qualify to be Governor of the most important State in
America&#150;California. Did I say kill Arab &#147;terrorists,&#148; well then, he
certainly qualifies in the eyes of the media warlords.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You don&#146;t believe this, do you? May I suggest that you exercise your
right of free speech by writing an op-ed piece for the <i>Washington Post</i> or the <i>New
York Times&#150;</i>the twin towers of Zionism&#150;castigating Jews in America and Israel
for committing genocide against the Palestinians and for forgetting that Americans died to
save them from the Holocaust (it&#146;s immaterial whether you believe it or not,
that&#146;s a free opinion in the land of the free). You say that&#146;s too hard. Okay,
how about this? Write a letter to them asking why hasn&#146;t the Congress ever
investigated Israel&#146;s deliberate attack in 1967 of the American intelligence ship,
the USS Liberty, killing 34 Americans and injuring 177? I see that&#146;s hard, too. Okay,
how about this? Write a letter asking Congress why the American taxpayer is paying for the
entire cost of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, but Congress refused to fund a
Second World War Veteran&#146;s Memorial for the men and women who died saving the Jews in
Europe? After a while, write another letter to these same papers stating that America
should do all it can to support Israel with more foreign aid, more weapons, more vetoes,
even if we have to protect our only &#147;democratic&#148; ally in the region. Guess which
letters will be printed? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Am I implying that our media is Jewish-owned, -controlled, and -run,
reflecting only Israel&#146;s point of view even though such total prostration to Israel
harms American interests? That it deliberately ignores Israel&#146;s wars, invasions,
massacres, destruction and mayhem of Arabs and Palestinians? That our media&#146;s
enormous influence on our political system ensures that our President and Congress will
never dare challenge the policy of America&#146;s true capital&#150;Tel Aviv? That our
media gets its marching orders, words, and images from Israel, its public relation
lobbying firms (AIPAC, JDL, ZOA, AJC, etc.), the Israeli Embassy, plus the all-important
Israeli military censors? That Israel uses our foreign aid tax dollars to hire public
relations firms and lobbyists to influence our government and spends that money in
political campaigns against our laws? That somehow every &#147;expert&#148; on television
and in the newspapers just happens to be Jewish or a pro-Israeli hired mouth? That somehow
there are no experts in America on Islam or the Middle East except Jews; or experts on any
other issue just happen to be Jewish? YES, YES, YES. Oh, man, I&#146;m getting a kosher
headache just thinking of all this kosher influence on our country, both people and
government. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Are Israel and its American soldiers and pandering government solely
responsible for the death and destruction inflicted upon innocent Arabs, Palestinians and
Muslims worldwide? Of course, not. Arabs, Palestinians and Muslims are just as guilty of
the death of these innocents as Israel, perhaps more so, due to their commission of
stupidities and omission of actions. For 53 years, while Israel has systematically killed
and robbed Palestinian land, our &#147;courageous&#148; Arab leaders have been too busy
believing their own ego and hegemony ambitions to comprehend Israel&#146;s true
intentions. Their intra- and inter-fighting is legendary. From squashing Islamic,
democratic and opposition political parties within their countries, they fought wars with
each other: Egypt against Saudi Arabia and the Gulf; Egypt against Libya; Egypt against
Sudan; Morocco against Algeria; Morocco against Mauritania; Iraq against Syria; Iraq
against Kuwait; Iraq against Saudi Arabia; Jordan against the PLO; Yemen against Saudi
Arabia; Qatar against Bahrain; Iraq against Iran; and the UAE against Iran. Unbelievable
hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives and squandered resources
have been spent by our Arab leaders to quench their military and dictatorial egos. So
little was spent on their own people&#146;s education, health and welfare; and even less
spent on fighting Israel&#146;s expansionism. Let&#146;s face it, our leaders are
uneducated, unsophisticated, uncultured military men or monarchs who are more adept at
undermining their own people and the greatest gift to humanity&#150;Islam&#150;than in
understanding the political, economic, diplomatic and military realities of the world.
They approach the American President as a monarch with their limited understanding that he
holds sway over his country like they do. All the American Monarch has to do is will it
and it&#146;s done. How stupidly na�ve they are despite the fact that many of our leaders
have been in office for decades, reelected each time with the alien percentage of 99.99%.
Arafat and these impotent dictators must leave. They are suffocating their people and
their faith with the usual barrage of lies and media manipulation. The most nauseating
spectacle of these leaders is their penchant for reviewing military parades of fat
officers, starving conscripts, and decaying weapons while the microphone rattles on for
hours about their wisdom and accomplishments. Their daily words of &#147;wisdom&#148;
appearing on every national newspaper is tantamount to mental cruelty. All of them are
more comfortable in their palaces than they are on the world stage or in front of the
world media presenting a logical case for Palestine that can influence public opinion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and every Jew is working for their self interest whether through
murders, lies, bribery or manipulation. One must respect their intelligence, dedication
and commitment. How can so few Jews ensure that the entire West is intimidated into
supporting what in any other country would be considered war crimes and genocide? But more
importantly is the question: How can so many Arabs and Muslims, one fifth of the entire
world, be so impotent, uneducated, impoverished despite oil wealth, uncaring and so easily
manipulated by the West? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is the combination of Arab impotence and Zionist prowess that
Palestinians are becoming an &#147;Endangered Species.&#148; All the globalization
arguments favour the Arabs <i>vis-a-vis</i> the West&#150;300 million consumers (Israel
totals 6 million), more nations, oil wealth, trade and tourism, nations that spend
billions of dollars on American products as well as save and invest money in the U.S.
(Israel takes billions of tax dollars from America), more strategic geographically for
American interests, an Islamic faith closest to Christianity (unlike Judaism that rejects
and humiliates Jesus [p]), and a people longing for the freedoms and liberties of the
West; yet it is Israel that dominates American politics and enjoys America&#146;s money,
weapons, vetoes and a free trade zone. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Oh, yes, the free trade zone priority. Mubarak, on his way to the U.S.
after the Arab summit in Amman, was asked about the possibility of renewing economic
sanctions against Israel. In his confident, bad English he stated, &#147;I was asked about
that by King Abdullah II of Jordan; he was worried about that; I told him to FORGET ABOUT
IT.&#148; Arab leaders came to Bush not with the serious intention of discussing the daily
murder of Palestinian civilians, although that was mentioned for domestic consumption, but
they both came to trade Palestinian lives for FREE TRADE ZONES. Why should Israel have one
and they don&#146;t, given that they&#146;ve rewarded Israel with peace treaties and taken
their countries out of the opposition camp?! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, the Palestinians have no one else but themselves to defend their
lives and lands. God bless the Palestinian intifada, although more peaceful resistance
should be adopted to stop the wasting of Palestine&#146;s future, and May God help start
an Arabic and Islamic intifada to ensure freedoms and liberties and a true adoption of
Islamic principles, and May God help start an American intifada to reclaim America for
Americans and restore her principles of freedom, liberty, justice and self-determination
for all. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Mubarak so eloquently says, FORGET ABOUT IT!</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Ariel Sharon&#146;s strategy is a menu for death </font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ray Hanania*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From the moment Ariel Sharon put his foot on the Haram al-Sharif compound
on 28 September, he has been following a plan. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The goal of that strategy is to destroy the anaemic peace process, and
then establish a precedent to use the Israel military to push out more Palestinians and to
&#147;re-capture&#148; lands &#147;conceded&#148; to the Palestinians under the terms of
the Oslo Peace Process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon, who is the epitome of Israeli fanaticism, is loyal not to justice
or fairness, but to the ultimate goals of the fanatic Israeli settler movement and the
legacy of the first terrorist in Palestine, Menachem Begin. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today&#146;s Israeli military incursion into Khan Younis is no different
than the day he entered the Haram al-Sharif surrounded by a thousand or more soldiers. The
purpose was to provoke Palestinians, kill Palestinians, and then take their land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His strategy is simple: Provoke the Palestinians in the boldest, most
audacious manner, and then respond with unrestrained, brutal military force when
Palestinians react. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is the strategy of the &#147;street bully&#148; who walks up to an
innocent man, points a gun in the man&#146;s face and makes threats. The man responds by
slapping away the gun and the bully then pulls the trigger, killing the victim, crying
that he did so in &#147;defence.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon is crying that he is killing Palestinians in &#147;defense,&#148;
as a result of attacks made by the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The assertion does not need to be truthful by any means. All Israel has to
do is say that the Palestinians are &#147;firing mortars&#148; into Israeli communities,
or that the Palestinians are &#147;throwing rocks&#148; at soldiers, and it becomes true. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Israel is assured of this because they, with the help of the United
States, prevented the United Nations from stationing an observer force in the areas in
order to confirm or deny Israel&#146;s accusations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel did not want an observer force, and the United States vetoed the
move. Why? Because a United Nation&#146;s Observer Force would conclude, unequivocally,
that the majority of the confrontations are provoked, started and initiated by Israeli
soldiers who frequently fire upon innocent Palestinians who gather to protest and urge an
end to the violence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I recently returned from a trip to Palestine where I witnessed, on three
occasions, Israeli soldiers firing upon Palestinians who did nothing more than protest. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli pattern is simple: They fire tear gas canisters into the
crowds, and then fire so-called &#147;rubber bullets.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The tear gas canisters are made in the United States. They are six inches
long and one and one-half inches in diameter, with a point. When they strike a human, they
cause tremendous harm. These canisters are unlike those used by American police to quell
riots, which are shaped like pop cans; they hurt, but don&#146;t kill. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The term &#147;rubber bullet&#148; refers to a steel ball-bearing that is
almost one inch in diameter and that is covered with a thin coat of plastic. In reality,
this is the so-called &#147;plastic bullet.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Additionally, Israel is using the so-called &#147;dum dum&#148; bullet,
which is a bullet that has a hole drilled into the head of the lead bullet. &#147;Dum
dum&#148; bullets have been outlawed in the United States, but are most often used to kill
large animals, such as elephants. The hollowed-out centre expands upon contact with skin
or flesh from the � inch diameter to a flattened and lethal 2-inch wide piece of lead
that enters the body with a small hole and exits with a hole large enough to put your fist
into, obviously killing the target. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon will continue to follow this strategy because he is assured of
three things: First, the Israeli Left or those who support peace are under a self-imposed
silence. Second, he knows that under George W. Bush, the United States will, in fact,
withdraw from the more active role it played in Middle East peace under President Clinton.
Third, he is convinced that the Arab world will not intervene to prevent the wholesale
massacre of the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan does not want to jeopardize its
application to receive &#147;Most Favoured Nation Trade Status&#148; from the U.S., thus
insuring a larger profit margin on product sales to the United States. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And most of the other Arab countries are on the American dole, preferring
not to risk the funding, loans and grants they now receive from the Americans. </p>
<b><i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></i><u>What can the Palestinians do? </u></b><br>
First, they must accept the long-term suffering that conflict with Israel&#146;s fanatic
Prime Minister will bring. They will either be killed with their hands outstretched in
peace, or holding a gun and a grenade. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Americans need to improve their media strategies and apply
professional methods to get our message out. The fact is that the American theatre is
where the future of the Palestinians lay. And until we learn to get our message out to
Americans, Israel will continue to lie, cheat, steal and murder. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis need to be reminded about how painful their refusal to return
our land really will be. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then, and only then, will Israel return to the peace table with a
realistic compromise that recognizes the rights of the Palestinian people. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Is Arafat losing control?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shehadeh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 April 2001, the Israeli newspaper <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i> reported the
findings of the Israeli military intelligence that unveiled the weak position of Arafat <i>vis-�-vis</i>
his control of the intifada. &#147;Arafat has not controlled the level of the flame for
some time now,&#148; said a security source, according to <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i>, &#147;as
he will have to pay a very high price to stop the violence and so far he is not doing
it,&#148; the source added. It was further reported that essential information on the
developments in the field has been kept from Arafat so that he would not deliberate on
major issues that deal with the intifada. Israelis who have met with Arafat in recent
weeks have been surprised by how little he knows about what is going on in the field.
While being vague about the details has always been an Arafat tactic, they say his lack of
awareness now is far beyond what it used to be. Those same Israelis say that they think
some of the senior officials in the PA security services are actively keeping information
away from Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One may not solicit <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i> for objective information when it
comes to the Palestinian cause, but one could not ignore that such views do somehow
conform to the very compromising positions espoused by Arafat in the peace process. It was
a huge compromise by the PLO to accept United Nations resolution 242 as the basis for
future negotiations, accepting in the process 22% of Palestine thus sacrificing their
rights to almost 93% of the lands they used to control in 1947. But when this extremely
compromised position is further &#147;compromised&#148; by the extra and greedy demands of
Israel in the West Bank and Gaza, then our leadership is trespassing on very dangerous
grounds that constitute an area beyond the jurisdiction of the PA as it belongs only to
the Palestinian people as a whole. The scenario is further aggravated when we realize that
very important issues like the right of return, Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the
final borders are also being further conceded to the Israeli&#146;s cruel demands. This
humiliating peace cannot survive even if the PA, under Israeli and U.S. pressure, stamped
it with its approval.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s no wonder then that the PA under the leadership of Arafat would
lose control over the peace process when their final decisions do not conform to the
minimal needs of the Palestinian masses. It is also not surprising to experience the
rejection of any future peace negotiations by several factions of the Palestinian
resistance and a huge sector of the Palestinian masses at large. Recent polls conducted by
several sources on both sides of the fence show that the majority of the Palestinians
reject even the idea of negotiations when all realize that the ceiling of Palestinian
legitimate demands has been set so low that it could not be construed except as a
humiliating compliance to the unending and greedy Israeli demands. With the unproductive
Arab summit conference deliberations, Sharon erroneously read the wrong message when he
concluded that the Palestinians are now isolated from outside help and that he could
dictate his humiliating terms to the Palestinians by using sheer force. This butcher of
Sabra and Shatilla did not learn from history that the determination of oppressed masses
is superior to all the military power he can muster. His promise to bring
&#147;security&#148; to Israel has obviously failed tragically in the face of the
determined resistance of the intifada. With the entire Israeli arsenal at work against the
Palestinians using tanks and choppers notwithstanding, the Palestinian resistance forces
were not deterred, in the least, when they carried out several military operations against
Israel right in the middle of their &#147;secured&#148; zones, which included bombings at
several locations inside Israel Proper, namely Kafr Saba and Jerusalem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recent Israeli reports show that Sharon&#146;s promise not to negotiate
with the PA unless Palestinian &#147;violence&#148; is reduced has been slightly altered
when he accepted in principle the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative to stop the violence by
demanding the redeployment of Israeli troops from the PA-controlled areas and immediately
start the negotiations again. Our problems in this regard are not only with the passive
roles undertaken by the Arab leadership, but also with the irresponsible concessions of
our national rights when it exceeds its jurisdiction in accommodating the unacceptable
Israeli demands. It&#146;s time that such leadership should move aside to give a younger
blood the opportunity to continue the struggle at the point where the PA has failed.
Irrespective of such development, the red lines of the Palestinian national rights should
be clearly laid down so that our homeland does not become contingent upon the individual
mood of any future leadership, but rather upon certain minimal demands that would make our
future goals fall within a viable and independent Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe that with all the painful killings of Palestinians
notwithstanding, the intifada should go on and all means and methods are to be used to
develop it into a homogenous armed struggle until our final national objectives are fully
actuated. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Qana Revisited</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">E. Yaghi</p>

<p ALIGN="center"></strong>In order to make sure that we will not forget that they were
alive in us, that their blood was ours, that their wounds were ours, that their children
were ours, and that we should keep them alive in our souls and make their memory forever
alive in the future generations&#146; minds so that these generations can be witnesses of
the nature of that hatred and that aggression, let us meet together in Qana&#133;every
year so we can remember that:</p>

<p ALIGN="center">They were still alive&#133;that night&#133;<strong></p>

<blockquote>
  </i><p ALIGN="center"></strong><em>Bahia Hariri- Deputy of Saida and South Lebanon</em><strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></strong>While the siege of Palestinian cities and villages continues and
the Israeli army occupies and re-occupies what is left of Palestine, let us also remember
the carnage that then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres was responsible for at a United Nations
base in South Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Killing Arabs is nothing new for Peres. In 1947, David Ben-Gurion, the
leader of Haganah&#150;a terrorist gang responsible for many massacres of Palestinian
civilians including the massacre at Deir Yassin&#150;appointed Shimon Peres as head of
manpower for Haganah. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of Israel&#146;s heroes became famous because they slaughtered
Palestinians and most of these killers were rewarded for their atrocities by being elected
prime ministers. It is Peres who bears responsibility for the brutal massacre at Qana.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It because of Israel&#146;s heavy bombardment of Lebanon in 1996 during
Operation Grapes of Wrath that civilians fled to the UN base at Qana, thinking they would
be safe. But Israeli shells hit the base that had become a sanctuary for the Lebanese
civilian refugees. Around 101 people were killed, including women and children. One baby
was decapitated and the limbs of the other civilians were found scattered around. Blood
was streaming everywhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel described the uncalled-for attack as an &#147;unfortunate
mistake.&#148; But it was no mistake at all and, in fact, was quite intentional. There are
videotapes that captured on film the deliberate Israeli attack on the base. Some of the
victims were cremated alive. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even though the Israelis knew that they had hit their target from the
first shells, they continued pumping 25 shells into the survivors and the bodies for up to
10 minutes after the first round of shells had landed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">UN investigators knew the attack was premeditated but the then-UN
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was pressured into tampering with and tempering
his report. Nevertheless, he was still forced to release it by some UN officials who had
threatened to resign if he did not. Israel denied the fact that it had planned to hit Qana
and the U.S. government made sure that the incident went unpunished and did its best to
cover up the facts. The fact that Boutros-Ghali did release the report prevented him from
becoming re-elected to a second term.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Lebanese will never forget how brutal the Israelis were under Shimon
Peres. Now Peres is an accomplice to PM Ariel Sharon who is waging genocide against the
Palestinian people. Partners in crime protected by the United States who allows such
atrocities to go unpunished from the inception of Israel up to the present situation in
the Palestinian Occupied Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The blood of these victims is the blood of us all; the dead children are
the children of us all, and every day we bear witness to further atrocities and Israeli
aggression. Where will it all end?</p>

<b>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Alternatives must be sought to combat media bias</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ramzy Baroud*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Pinpointing the bias of the mainstream American media in regards to issues
concerning the Middle East is quite an easy task. All you need to do is buy an issue of
the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i> or any other celebrated publication,
and head toward the Op-Ed section. Bias can be found right from the start, in headlines,
opening statements and paragraphs, even the photos chosen to be placed with articles. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similarly, it&#146;s easy to spot an even-handed article, not as if they
exist in abundance, but because once pro-Palestinian readers locate an article buried
toward the end of a newspaper, they forward it to their news groups, personal e-mail
lists, accompanied with notes urging one another to send thank you letters to the editor
for his courage and fairness. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, while bias in an editorial or opinion piece can be easily
detected, news reports have a better chance of fooling the trusty reader, for a
reporter&#146;s job is to simply narrate an event with objectivity and honesty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With regards to the Israeli-Arab conflict, American reporters can be
divided into two groups; ones who base their reports on official statements made by U.S.
and Israeli officials (and to a lesser extent Palestinians), and recycled news from
Western media sources. And another group, who has access to original reporting, yet
chooses to disregard certain facts and consider others, serving therefore a suspicious
political agenda. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To illustrate, consider the week of 28 March to 3 April. During this week,
Palestinian casualties mounted. Deaths and injuries among Palestinians were counted by the
hundreds, a fate that reached Palestinians from different age brackets, many of whom were
women and children. Most, if not all of them were either killed or wounded inside
Palestinian towns and villages. Some were bombed in their schools, homes, hotels,
cars,..etc. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israelis and Jewish settlers too had their share of causalities, although
statistically speaking Israeli losses were minimum if compared with Palestinians. Another
important factor is the geographical areas in which much of Israel&#146;s losses accrued,
which mainly fell in occupied Palestinian territories, where Palestinians have endured a
suffocating siege which has ruined their economy and put most of the population under the
poverty level. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the Associated Press saw things a bit different, or perhaps entirely
different. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a new report posted 3 April, the AP narrated the week&#146;s event in a
greatly distorted fashion.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>A Palestinian mortar attack on a Jewish settlement in the
Gaza Strip seriously wounded a 10-month-old boy on Tuesday, barely a week after the
slaying of a 10-month-old Jewish girl&#148;, is how AP decided to put it&#146;s
introductory statement in a news report that seemed to be telling the story from an
Israeli viewpoint only. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similar to most of its news reports, AP reiterated words often used by
Israeli army generals to excuse their bombing of Palestinian towns and villages throughout
the West Bank and Gaza, such as &#147;retaliation.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, Israel chooses to date any event back to where it finds
suitable. According to Israel, the killing of a Palestinian was an act of retaliation for
a prior assault by Palestinians against an Israeli solider or settler. Although
Palestinians could cite hundreds of events that would justify the reason behind their
attacks&#150;the killing of over 400 people, the wounding of 20,000, the siege, the
kidnapping of officials and the assassination of activists are only a few examples. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, most American newspapers accept Israel&#146;s justification
of their violence, and dedicate few words to Palestinians&#146; perspective over the same
matter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Tuesday, 3 April, over 50 Palestinians were wounded during
Israel&#146;s helicopter strikes against the Gaza Strip alone. The news of the bombing was
widely available in Arab newspapers and was broadcast on TV, joined by images of the
wounded. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">AP reporters, however, made no mention of those wounded. Instead, he/she
made the Jewish baby in the Atzmona settlement, south of Gaza, the focus of the story. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While Palestinian causalities are often listed as inexact estimates, often
all the way on the bottom of news reports (which leave out reference to ages, genders or
any other information of relevance), Israel&#146;s casualties are often mentioned, time
and again, with necessary and unnecessary details. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Half of the report by Karin Laub for AP described the baby&#146;s
condition, examined his mother&#146;s feelings, quoted the doctor who treated him, and
cited the hospital that he was escorted to. Then she retrieved another event, where
another Israeli Jewish settler&#146;s child was wounded. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shockingly, Laub overlooked details of daily heinous crimes committed by
Jewish settlers since the outbreak of the uprising six months ago, concluding &#147;the
settler&#146;s have been targeted for attack throughout the Palestinian uprising that
began more than six months ago.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the dozens of injured Palestinians, just one day before the wounding
of the Jewish baby, a Palestinian child was wounded seriously in the head. Interestingly,
the child, Said Amin Al-Khiat was hit by an Israeli bullet in al-Shaboura refugee camp,
less than half a mile away from the Israeli settlement. AP said nothing about Said, nor
did they narrate the story of his mother, nor did they quote his doctor. But for the sake
of fairness, Said might have been mentioned as a number somewhere at the bottom of a news
report, where very few people likely pause to ponder the fact that his life, too, was
precious. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the same American media that reiterated the racist Israeli
propaganda which stated that Palestinian parents throw their children into the crossfire
to get them killed for media attention, pay little time to question the Jewish
parents&#146; choice to move their families into the middle of an impoverished,
dehumanized and abused Palestinian population, endangering their lives to uphold the
misread teachings of a religious fantasy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the American media finds itself comfortable with certain
terminology, again dictated by Israel, such as &#147;Palestinian militant,&#148;
&#147;gunmen,&#148; &#147;terrorists&#148;, while using words like &#147;troops&#148;,
&#147;Army unit&#148; and &#147;elite forces&#148; to describe the army assassination
units.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While journalistic integrity compels us to relate to historic facts that
might be of some value, very little is said in regards to the international law&#146;s
perception of the Middle East conflict. Little is said about the illegality of Jewish
settlements or human rights groups&#146; criticism of Israel&#146;s excessive use of
violence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lack of integrity in American journalism is not a new notion, nor is it
hard to explain. However, undermining the influence of such an establishment calls for the
creation of viable alternatives, using printed publications or the Internet as mediums to
take us from the position of angry critics into creators of solutions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The news is out there, ready to be told, with honesty or deception. Time
is too precious to waste urging corporate media to become fair. Let us narrate the news
the way we see it, for Palestinian babies, too, deserve to have their stories told. </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><i>Reflection on Easter Sunday, 2001</i></strong><b></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Samah Jabr*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The human race lives in the context of nature. But, we have at least two
gifts that the other species do not have. One is the power of reason; the other is
recognition that we can choose to love. Those two talents set us apart from other animals
and make us who we are. Our DNA structure&#150;the map that leads us to understand
ourselves&#150;is so similar to the genetic layout of other species, including animals and
even the plants, that we are chagrined to realize how very close humans are to everything
else in nature. We are uniquely human only through a very few twists in the coils of our
genes. Increasingly, as our understanding of the world we live in is revealed to us, we
realize our connection to everything and every being on our globe. We are here together,
like it or not. And like it or not, we are not making much progress on God&#146;s holy
ground. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This story will go to print on Easter, the Christian day of redemption and
hope. It may be read by those of us not filled with hope as we live in the turmoil of a
catastrophe, or &#147;nakba&#148;, as we say in Arabic. The Zionists, armed to bombard
Palestine with another &#147;nakba&#148;, may read what I have to say at the end of their
reverent Passover prayer or during a dirge of despair over the holocaust visited upon the
Jewish people in the 1940s in Germany. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Christians in America may see the article soon after they celebrate the
victory of Jesus Christ over death. How will they react, I wonder? Will the sermons they
hear on Easter Sunday speak only of the redemption of heaven and fail to acknowledge that
redemption on earth is missing in the hell their so-called Holy Land has become? My friend
in America worries that many Christian preachers will shy away from mentioning what is
happening to Palestinians in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Galilee. If they choose
not to speak out in defence of Palestinian Muslims or even their own Christian Palestinian
sisters and brothers, it will be because they do not want to be labelled anti-Jewish. So,
they will be silent. They will worry that any reference indicating pity for Palestinians
will be construed as politically incorrect. They will fret about putting their jobs on the
line or allowing their communities to question their &#147;right thinking&#148; and
character. Like Peter, they may deny our pain saying, &#147;Evil exists everywhere and
genocide is not just in Palestine.&#148; Like the disciples, they will be asleep in their
pulpits when we suffer yet another raid or attack. They will simply look the other way. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, so, like animals who do not worry about their peers around the globe
because they do not have the intellect to know, people who live far from the war around us
will dismiss our suffering as not being their concern. Unfortunately, these people do have
the intellect to know. They make the choice to ignore their own culpability in our horror,
because they fail to understand the most basic of religious teachings everywhere and
anywhere: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are many Americans who may read my story and lament that it is
one-sided. It is! I only know what I experience. The Christian ministers are correct:
violence and hate do penetrate places all over our globe. Does that make it right
anywhere? Does it mean less because it&#146;s happening in Palestine? Are we cut off from
Christian love and Muslim reverence and Jewish moral values because we just happen to live
in this corner of the globe? Readers may say, &#147;No,&#148; but it doesn&#146;t feel
that way to me and to those around me. All we feel is oppression and disregard and the
stigma of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Intellectually, I know that we Palestinians are not alone. Where in the
world is there peace today? Is it in America where African-Americans can still be dragged
behind cars until dead or immigrants maligned as unwelcome talent, even in places where
they are the only ones willing to do unpleasant work? Can one be safe in Ireland where the
Catholics wage war against the Protestants and vice versa for some un-remembered treason
that one side or the other committed before anyone living today was born? Dare we venture
to Southeast Asia, where wars and rumours of wars seem endless? What about China or
Russia, Africa or South America? Where in the world are we <i>Homo sapiens</i> doing to
each other as we would like others to do unto us? How God must be weeping! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are not animals. We do not eat each other for dinner out of necessity.
We know what we&#146;re doing and why. We are told by generations of economists that our
overpopulated world requires pestilence and war to keep our numbers down. But we know that
we have the gifts of reason, the ability to choose love, and the knowledge to control
ourselves today without murder, without hate, and without tribalism that takes without
giving. Why aren&#146;t we using the intelligence God has given us? How do we blame God
for the evil we do to each other? How dare we? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I write this because living amid war I see my fellow human beings turn
into animals, fighting for life or fighting to take away life. I see those who claim,
regardless of their current family histories, to come from the Biblical lineage of Isaac
with the right and purpose of crushing us into oblivion. I see my people being chased
down, disparaged, misunderstood, hated and feared. I read the words of an important Jewish
rabbi who told his flock in a Passover charge that &#147;God will take deadly revenge
against Arabs, will wipe out their seed, will annihilate them and defeat them and
eliminate them from this world.&#148; Why? Is it because we are not Jewish, but live in
the place that Zionists, certainly not all Jewish peoples, have decided is their home? Is
it because my people try to protect what is ours, the land and homes we&#146;ve lived in
for generations? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other night, Americans were treated to a special showing of the Andrew
Lloyd musical, &#147;Jesus Christ Super Star.&#148; To some of the Muslims watching, the
show was blasphemous, disrespectful; to some Christians, the show was rampant with
violence, fear and hate made no less acceptable when set to song. One of my friends
lamented that amid all the generic costumes&#150;none clearly Roman, Jewish or
Christian&#150;only Arabs were identifiable. When Jesus entered the temple to find people
using the sanctuary for a display of sheer evil, these characters were dressed in costumes
clearly recognizable as stereo-typical Palestinian, Saudi, Jordanian and Egyptian. Men
wore current-era red and black keffiyehs and women wore veils on their faces, but
shamelessly little else. The design insults the Arab world. How could the designer of
those costumes take such care to make sure that no one watching could construe any of the
evil people as being Christian or Jewish or Western? How could the actor playing Jesus be
the only blond Nordic-type in the cast? How could the most evil of evil be recognizably
Arab? Was it to imply that the Arabs killed Jesus absolving Jews, Christians, Romans, and
the rest of humanity of the deed? My friend thought the show was powerful; the music
brought to life the reality of the suffering of man and his relationship with God; but the
suggestive costumes, glistening with beads of prejudice, desiccated the goodness the
musical was meant to impart. It served to give Americans a reason to hate and to justify
acceptance of the evil perpetuated against Palestinians now. Religion is very much a part
of the political game being played in Palestine/Israel. Make no mistake, religion provides
us with our moral values and guides us into the richness of our being. Given, however, the
freedom of thought God has graciously bestowed upon us, religion has the potential to be
twisted every which way, including as an excuse for evil. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">God allows us to make our own definitions. Christian children learn to
sing, &#147;Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&#148; Really, I have
to ask? Doesn&#146;t Jesus love me, too? Our book, the Qur&#146;an, says so. What&#146;s
missing here? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What about the Torah with its 613 Mitzvot? I got a list of those rules and
there I saw it written, Mitzvot 1,2, 3 and 4. &#147;Know there is God,&#148;
&#147;Don&#146;t believe in any other,&#148; &#147;Know that He is One,&#148; &#147;Love
Him.&#148; We Muslims and Christians believe this, too. Are we so very different, then?
There&#146;s more. Mitzvot 15: &#147;Don&#146;t hate your brothers.&#148; I wonder, does
that include half-brothers, the sons of Abraham and Hagar or just the sons of Abraham and
Sarah? Mitzvot 20: &#147;Don&#146;t take revenge;&#148; Mitzvot 18: &#147;Don&#146;t
oppress the weak.&#148; I&#146;ve heard this kind of moral reasoning spoken by Christian
Palestinians and Western peoples of all kinds, including many, many people of the Jewish
faith. Who are the weak? Upon whom is revenge to be taken? Where do we fit in the message
of these ancient moral guidelines? Here&#146;s the crux of the matter as I see it every
time I experience Israeli injustice: whenever one group or another decides to assert
themselves as the only &#147;right-thinking&#148; people on earth or set themselves apart
from the rest of the human family because of race, religion, resources or sex, some very
great wrongs result. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Consider these Mitzvot. Mitzvot 596: &#147;Destroy seven Canaanite
nations;&#148; Mitzvot 597: &#147;Don&#146;t let anyone of them live;&#148; Mitzvot 598:
&#147;Blot out the seed of Amalek.&#148; Is that the Palestinians? Is it I? Are we the
Canaanites or the seed of Amalek? Is this the justification of what is happening to us? Do
we still see ourselves as separate, as Hebrew or Canaanite, as the children of Abraham and
Sarah or of Abraham and Hagar? Haven&#146;t we come to realize the commonality of our
genetic heritage? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Do you not see the discrepancies, my Jewish brothers and sisters? Do the
Golden Rule ideas only apply to those in your perceived modern tribe? Do only the
murderous rules apply to us? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is the time of remembrance of the Nakba of 1948; it is the time of
remembrance of the Holocaust of the early 1940s. It is the time of Christians&#146; vision
of redemption. Does all this recalling mean nothing in terms of how we treat each other?
When will humanity recognize its obligation to love, to care, to cease tribalism and
obsession with the childish disposition of taking anything regardless of the harm such
selfishness does to others? When will our Jewish fellow human beings come to the
realization that if God chose them, it was to be an example of goodness and not to be
destructive agents of other peoples also created by God? I use the word Jewish here, not
just the politically correct label of Zionist. Is it not the friends of Israel&#150;those
of Jewish faith in America and those non-Jews who were shamed by their lack of reaction to
the holocaust&#150;who support Zionism and ignore how this idea ravages Palestinians? Is
it not the friends of the Israeli lobby (now quietly influencing as many as 300 American
representatives on America&#146;s Capitol Hill) who ask the United States to budget $800
million in supplemental assistance for Israel so that Israel can continue to crush more
&#147;evil&#148; Palestinians? Is it not the friends of Israel who have given Zionists
their power? I do not write this in hatred or to stir hatred; I write it because I want to
survive. I am only doing what is natural. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are called &#147;terrorists.&#148; Why? AIPAC, the Jewish lobby in the
United States, tells American friends of Israel that &#147;Palestinians have levelled
6,000 terrorist attacks against Israelis since October 2000.&#148; What 6,000 attacks? Are
they speaking of 12-year-old-boys throwing rocks at American-made tanks? Did 6,000 suicide
bombers blow things up? Where are the reality checks our closely knit world should
provide? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I think in terms of a doctor and consequently, amid my nightmare of
thoughts about my family and my people, return to a sense of reason learned through the
study of modern medicine. Science is important to me. I enjoy the process of seeing that
every question answered leads to another question asked. Religion is important to me as
well. In religion, too, I ask questions as I seek my own relationship to the entity so
much greater than myself. Science and religion tell me that change is ongoing and
inevitable. Yet, all I see around me is primitive reactions that are reminiscent of the
Dark Ages. I cannot help but wonder what is changing. We have science to give us
understanding and religion to tell us how to behave. What are we doing with these
disciplines, particularly with regard to religion? Ask yourself, &#147;What political
entity on earth today behaves in a manner Moses, Jesus or Mohammed would find acceptable?
What nation believes in doing unto others as it would have done to it? Instead, we use our
religions to justify acts of violence and evil. We do not get the point that Moses, Jesus
and Mohammed set before us: Do to each other what you would have done to you. That piece
of information, advice, a moral pronouncement, see it as you will, seems lost in the
mingling of greed and hatred borne from fear of our differences. We are changing. We know
how very much alike we really are. When are we going to connect through our sameness and
change our morality to nurture our planet and each other and to simply do what we all say
we believe? When will we begin to do unto each other what we wish done to us? Next Easter,
maybe? </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">The Olive Tree</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ruth Anderson</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I</strong>t&#146;s early evening. Out over my mountain circle, the sun
casts it last rays through a perfect spring day. A vendor, selling hot Arabic coffee in a
shining silver thermos, sets his stand down in the middle of the newly ploughed ground of
the semi-park and waits for potential customers to smell his tempting brew.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On benches all over the circle, older women sit in clusters, holding
grandchildren on their laps while discussing the days that somehow slipped away as
fleetingly as grains of sand slip through a sieve. A grey-haired gentleman wearing a
darker grey suit meanders by the benches, the clusters of women and the coffee vendor,
clutching his prayer beads in one hand. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An even older man, bent with age, hangs on to a cane in one hand and
hobbles over to the middle of the large circle, sheds his stained rumpled beige jacket and
painfully lays himself down on top of his tired mantel to soak up the last rays of the
solar orb. Not so far away, infants toddle across the cobblestone sidewalk and two
youngsters gather excitedly around a huge shaggy lamb tugged by two older boys.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Overhead flocks of wild pigeons fly in perfect formations high above the
mountain circle, high above the grey houses that line the paved avenues across from the
circle. Below, a few young boys try their luck with home-made kites but the wind velocity
is too low for kite flying so the boys give up, wind up their kite string and walk away
disgruntled. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From the fourth floor of our building, I look out the window at the
colourful panorama spread out before me. Down below, I notice my husband kick away some of
the rubble of our torn up sidewalk. Gone is the olive tree he planted 16 years ago. It
only took one minute for the bulldozer to tear it out from its roots. My husband could not
say anything to the city workers who came the other morning to dig up our sidewalk and cut
it away so the street undulating around our house could be widened. No one asked him if it
was okay if they tore up his sidewalk and bulldozed his tree.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I noticed that most Palestinians must plant trees and flowers wherever
they go. It is as if in this way, they take a bit of their country with them. Sometimes,
tiny breeze-block homes in refugee camps will be laced with large tin cans sprouting
beautiful flowers or small trees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Watching my husband, I remembered my old father-in-law and how he tended
his trees in his home away from home in Jordan, close to where my husband and I now live.
He made sure he pruned them, watered them, protected them from my children&#146;s small
eager hands and as best he could, from the forces of nature, too. He proudly watched my
children and I pick mulberries, cherries, peaches and grapes from his mini-orchard, from
the fruits of his labour.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My husband is so like him in many ways, so different from him in others.
He has the same love for plants, the same knack with trees, the same tendency to care and
prune, water and protect his three olive trees that he had managed to plant around the
entranceway of our building. Whenever kids swarmed home from school, my husband would be
near his olive trees, making sure no careless hands plucked away the leaves or broke the
branches.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then, one of the three trees was bulldozed. In an instant, the love
and care of 16 years was done away with. His tree was a symbol of his lost orange
orchards. The last remnant of those fond images of the sweet days where he ran carefree in
and out of summer sprinklers in his veritable Garden of Eden not too far from the coast of
Jaffa. The oranges that his father harvested were called Jaffa oranges and were renowned
throughout Europe for their pleasant taste and dark glistening orange skin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I watch him kick through the rubble, I see his face carry a pained look
but climbing back up the stairs, he says nothing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I know he would not say much about this one olive tree, one of the last
living symbols of his long ago orange and olive trees back home in Palestine. But though
he speaks little, I sense his loss. But we both say as little as possible about the
incident for not so far from where we live, Palestinians in the Occupied Territories are
under siege. Their trees that sustain them are bulldozed, their land desecrated, their
homes demolished, their children beaten, imprisoned, tortured, shot at, wounded or killed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How could we speak of one olive tree in our miniature oasis when an
hour&#146;s drive from us, a holocaust is being waged against the indigenous inhabitants
of the remnants of Palestine? It only takes an instant to uproot a tree, but it takes
years of care and love to nurture it. And it only takes an instant to take away the life
of an innocent person, the life that some mother had tended more lovingly and tenderly
than the bulldozed trees in Occupied Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The workers who uprooted our tree did not throw it away. They gently
brushed off the rubble the roots clung to and placed it in a truck to take it to a home of
one of the city workers. I hope that it will give someone pleasure and that he will tend
it as carefully and as lovingly as my husband once did.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Nature of Gush Emunim Settlements</font></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font></b><font size="3">The Oslo process initiated a change in the
almost unqualified admiration of Gush Emunim and the NRP. Fears arose that NRP followers
in the army might refuse to carry out government orders for Israeli withdrawals from parts
of the occupied territories and/or for the removal of one or more Jewish settlements. The
fears expanded following the Rabin assassination. Even before the assassination, Baruch
Kimmerling, in his April 6, 1994 Haaretz article, reflected a bit of the early
apprehension and fear. He discussed the increasing penetration of the Israeli army by
religious zealots and the powerful influence of the religious settlers upon units
stationed in the territories. Kimmerling concluded: &quot;Now it is all important that the
army's command sees to it that every army unit is supervised. Perhaps those officers and
even entire units, which were for too long involved in negotiations with the religious
settlers and in protecting them and which have in the process developed too much affinity
with them, should be instantly disbanded.&quot; Kimmerling regarded his recommendation as
only a stopgap solution. The army high command did not accept and most of the attentive
public ridiculed the recommendation at that time. Kimmerling recognized that &quot;in the
long range&quot; the problem that had arisen would be insoluble without a deep change in
society. He wrote: &quot;On the one hand, it is difficult to see how the army, having a
significant number of officers adhering to ideology of religious settlers, could evacuate
a Jewish settlement. On the other hand, I find it difficult to imagine how the Israeli
army could be ideologically purified.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Worth noting here are the two unique schemes devised for young NRP
followers in an organized fashion to serve in and penetrate the combat and elite units.
The first scheme was formulated as an arrangement, not governed by law, between two
independent parties: the Israeli defense ministry and the rabbinical heads of the NRP's
Hesder Yeshivot religious schools. According to this arrangement, Hesder Yeshivot students
receive a special kind of draft service. They are not inducted into the army in the normal
way and thus do not serve continuously for three years in units assigned by the army
according to its needs. The regular army units almost always consist of soldiers holding
differing religious and secular views. The Hesder Yeshivot students instead are inducted
into the army as a group and serve in their own homogeneous companies, accompanied by
their rabbis who are responsible for and watch over the students' &quot;religious
purity.&quot; They serve for eighteen months rather than for the full three years. The
eighteen- month period is not continuous but is rather divided into three six-month
periods. After each period of army service, the Hesder Yeshivot students leave the army
for a six-month period of talmudic study in a yeshiva wherein the presumably negative
influences of having met secular Jewish soldiers are supposedly countered. The Hesder
Yeshivot soldiers continue to serve in reserve units under the usual conditions. The
political pressure exerted by Gush Emunim and the sympathy for its members felt by army
generals in the 1970s were partly responsible for this special arrangement. The major
reason for its continuation, however, is the excellent military quality and record of
Hesder Yeshivot students. Their performance is far above the average of those in the
Israeli army and their dedication is even greater. Not only the generals but also other
soldiers hold this view. During the three years of the Lebanon War (1982-85) and in the
aftermath of fighting in the &quot;security zone,&quot; for example, Hesder Yeshivot
students continued fighting and winning even after a high proportion of Israeli soldiers
had been wounded and killed. Soldiers in Hesder Yeshivot units also distinguished
themselves during the suppression of the Intifada; they were noted for their cruelty to
Palestinians, which was from many perspectives much more severe than the Israeli army
average. The homogeneous composition of Hesder Yeshivot companies of soldiers is another
reason for the continuation of the special arrangement. When the army commanding officers
have wanted to inflict especially cruel punishment upon Palestinians or others, they have
most often relied upon and used religious soldiers. In more ordinary companies, consisting
of soldiers holding varying political views, some members might object to illegal cruelty
and even inform media people of its use. In Hesder Yeshivot units the religious soldiers,
who are anyway more cruel than most secular Jews, will not object to the orders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From 1996, when indications appeared that membership in the Hesder
Yeshivot had stopped increasing and may have begun to decrease, the religious pre-military
academy scheme became the chief means of organized penetration by NRP supporters into the
Israeli army. By this arrangement the young men, usually eighteen years of age, who enter
religious pre-military academies are given draft deferments for one or one and one-half
years of study. Afterwards, they serve for three years in ordinary combat or elite units.
This is in contrast to serving, as do Hesder Yeshivot students, in homogeneous companies
or units. The teachers in these academies are for the most part not rabbis but rather
ex-officers who possess some talmudic knowledge. Only a small amount of the teaching is
devoted to military subjects and training in hiking and endurance. Most of the teaching
and study time is devoted to those parts of the Talmud and other religious literature that
inculcate dedication to the land of Israel and to other values favored by Gush Emunim. The
ascetic pre-military academy life is attractive to religious youth who are often in
reaction against the hedonistic life style of secular Israeli youth. Since their inception
the pre- military academies have been situated in settlements in the Occupied Territories.
The army has from the beginning subsidized these academies to some extent, but the major
part of the support money has come from private donors. Most graduates of these
pre-military academies are well prepared and advance to the officer corps. Persuaded that
the Israeli army is sacred, those who come out of these academies almost always serve
their full three-year terms. Some serve for a much longer time and become career officers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the Rabin assassination, many Israelis began to view the increasing
number of NRP followers in the army as a threat to the government and to the Israeli
regime as a whole. Ran Edelist summarized this concern well in his September 13, 1996
article in the Hebrew-language newspaper Yerushalaim, titled &quot;First We Shall Conquer
the Supreme Court and Then the General Staff.&quot; The title of this article suggests the
desire to penetrate and conquer the most important institutions of the State of Israel. In
discussing the general aims of the messianic religious right, of which the religious
settlers are the advance guard, Edelist wrote:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Their institutions have the stamina of a long-distance runner since they
believe in the eternal survival of the Jewish nation; in this framework they prepared four
approaches for the battle of the land of Israel: settlements, financial support, education
and promotion of their men in the army to achieve domination of a future General Staff.
This is not a conspiracy but a cool estimate of a national situation in their struggle for
a future image of Israeli society and a sophisticated use of an opportunistic government,
enabling them to fill their budgets. It is not a case of good and bad but a struggle about
the character of the State of Israel. The religious right wing uses the legitimate
approach of conquering positions of power of which the General Staff is central. It may be
said that since the inception of Israel the secret slogan of Israeli politicians was
&quot;we shall conquer first the security apparatus and then the Knesset and
government.&quot; Ben-Gurion did this when he pushed out Sharett and Lavon. Golda Meir's
slogan was &quot;the party is everything,&quot; and since her time the Labor party has
ruled in the General Staff. This rule was so absolute that Begin and Shamir, during the
time that they were prime ministers, did not succeed in shaking this and forming another
General Staff that would be influenced by their ideology. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Understanding Israeli politics, the religious settlers devised and evolved
their plan of penetrating the army, its officer corps and ultimately the General Staff. As
Edelist wrote: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The religious settlers understood that with the help of only party
politics and their ideology they would not get far and would not achieve a State of Israel
in the borders promised by God. If they therefore want to be represented in every place in
which the important decisions are made, especially in the army as a whole and particularly
in the General Staff, they must be represented in such places. First the aim and then the
means to achieve that end were decided. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hesder Yeshivot and the religious pre-military academies became those
means. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Israeli political observers and commentators seconded Edelist's
analysis. In his January 24, 1997 Haaretz article, titled &quot;The Army of the
Lord,&quot; Yidan Miller, for example, described the views of Dr Reuven Gal, who served as
the chief psychologist of the Israeli army between 1976 and 1982 and then became the
director of the highly respected Karmet Institute for Military and Social Research. Dr
Gal, according to Miller, summarized the data about volunteering to serve in combat units
from 1994 through 1996 and compared them with corresponding data of 1989. Dr Gal reported
that whereas 60 per cent of secular youth in 1989 wanted to serve in combat units, the
average for the 1993 to 1996 period dropped to 48 per cent. Most of that decline occurred
in 1995 and 1996. The decline was greatest in the secular kibbutzim, localities with large
leftist majorities. 'Me drop was from 83 per cent in 1989 to 58 per cent in the 1993 to
1996 period. In comparison, among the religious youth the wish to volunteer to combat
units remained constant at about 80 per cent during the same time. In religious kibbutzim,
the figure went to 90 per cent. Before the Oslo agreement a large majority of religious
youth entering the army considered a commander's order to be superior to any instruction
from a rabbi. This had changed by 1996. Citing Dr Gal's summary, Miller wrote: &quot;For a
significant part of them [the religious youth] instruction by a rabbi had an equal and
sometimes superior value than did an order from a commander.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Publication of such findings disturbed many secular Jews. They attempted
to acquire for their youth opportunities for army careers similar to those afforded
religious youth. They advocated the establishment of secular pre-military academies.
During the first two years of the Netanyahu government, however, when the Oslo process
stagnated, the numbers of secular youth who volunteered to serve in combat units increased
to a point unparalleled since the 1970s. This adversely affected the attempted penetration
into the army of the messianic religious right. Comprising only 6 to 7 per cent of the
Israeli Jewish populations the messianic religious right depended for its penetration upon
the absence of motivation of other Jews to serve in combat units. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following Netanyahu's election in 1996, two factors motivated more Israeli
Jewish youth to volunteer for combat units. The rising level of Arab hostility to Israel
and to its elected government constituted the first factor. Some Arab leaders issued war
threats. Most of Israel's Jewish youth considered all of this unjustified and responded in
the traditional Israeli manner by advocating increased militarism. The second factor arose
from the perception that Netanyahu's government was a new coalition of Jewish minorities,
which as never before in the history of the state has allowed those previously excluded
from important social opportunities and advancements to succeed. For the first time in
Israeli history the defense minister and the chief of staff were Oriental Jews. The older,
Labor-sympathizing elite members of the army opposed those appointments. This most likely
encouraged young Israeli Jewish males who were not from Ashkenazi Labor-supporting
families to seek careers as army officers. Most of these and other such young men
previously thought that they would not be allowed to become career officers. Among the
lower-income class of Israeli Jews an army career with its relatively high salaries is
prestigious as well as economically attractive. Except for computer experts, doctors and
other highly educated specialists, the way to a good career is to serve in a combat unit. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ironically, the collapse of the detested Oslo process adversely affected
the religious settlers in their attempt to penetrate the Israeli army and in that way to
achieve a commanding influence over Israeli policies. During most of the time that the
Oslo process continued under the Rabin and Peres governments, the religious settlers'
chances of penetrating the army increased. 'Me religious settlers' chances of determining
specific Israeli policies decreased after Netanyahu and Likud came to power in 1996.
Perhaps, this development provides us with an example of what is sometimes the fate of
fanaticism: the fanatic group thrives when it perceives itself to be in danger or
threatened by other parts of its own society. Conversely, when faced by a society that has
become unified against what is believed to be an outside threat, the fanatic group is less
able to penetrate major institutions such as the army and to influence long-range policy.</p>
