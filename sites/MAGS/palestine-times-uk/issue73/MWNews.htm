<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>On the occasion of the 9th anniversary
of the Sudan revolution</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Randa Awadh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>     </FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>Eight years have passed since
the Sudan revolution.  Many thought it would only survive a few months.
The new government was born into an environment of international change.
 Soon after the new Sudan&iacute;s birth, the Soviet Union collapsed leaving
only one dominant power in the international arena to control and monopolize
the world through what is now called &quot;the new world order&quot;.  All
of a sudden Sudan became a target for all kinds of cleverly devised accusations
such as hosting terrorism and violating human rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In the opinion of many observers the Sudanese government
has survived because of the deep trust and loyalty of the people to their
leaders.  This compatibility has been achieved through the following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1.  The Islamic attitude adopted by the revolution was
a dream come true for the Sudanese people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2.  Many achievements were accomplished in spite of unfavourable
and difficult conditions which prevailed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3.  The leaders of the revolution are from the people themselves--an
example of fairness and asceticism. This made the people trust in the government
and in any programmes, however difficult, it adopted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The political administration should be a reflection
of the nation&iacute;s wants and needs.  Soon after the revolution the western
provinces asked the government to apply Islamic law and the government conceded,
thus fulfilling the dream of the Sudanese people while gaining their trust
and loyalty at the same time; a dream ignored and put aside by other political
parties.  Of course such a step wrought many difficulties and dangers for
the Sudanese people both locally and internationally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In building the new Sudan a number of points were
taken into consideration by the government:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1.  Reviving hope and life in the people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2.  Concentrating on programmes which emphasized independence,
pride and self-esteem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3.  Defining the problems of the country and setting solutions
and reform plans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     These points helped Sudan cut the red tape put in
place by the new world order as a result of it&iacute;s pro-Islamic government.
Slogans appeared such as &igrave;we eat what we plant&icirc; and &igrave;we
wear what we make&icirc;. The government also fought international monopoly
of sugar and wheat and succeeded, thus achieving self-sufficiency in these
vital commodities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     These victories resulted in many problems. Suddenly
Sudan was making international news headlines -- first as a terrorist country
and second as a violator of human rights. Consequently, the international
community isolated it politically and economically.  However, neither did
the Sudan government nor did the people waver; they stood fast.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Another problem boosted by the international community
was the southern rebels led by John Garang. By 1989, owing to the weakness
of the Sudanese army and internal strife among its political parties, rebels
had seized about 90% of southern Sudan.  The new government made its number-one
priority to free all cities. This was achieved by 1993 which increased the
people&iacute;s trust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     One of the most important positive points, as mentioned
by Lebanese politician, writer and prominent party leader Kareem Bakardouni,
is the Sudanese leaders themselves. They are honest, fair and ascetic. Their
lifestyle is simple and rough; similar to any Sudanese common man.  Nobody
doubts their political, strategic, intellectual or leadership capabilities.
It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for any external force to
threaten or terrorize them or the people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The future is brighter for Sudan for two reasons:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1.  The peace agreement signed with the rebels and neighbouring
countries in the south.  Although both Uganda and Eriteria are still trying
to remove, indirectly, the Islamic government in Khartoum, there are rumours
of a plan to attack the eastern part of Sudan.  However, the Sudanese government
is militarily ready to fight off any attack in order to protect its sovereignty
over its land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2.  Oil has been discovered and mined.  It will be utilized
in the future for the benefit of attaining an independent state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The problem with Egypt remains. Establishing good
relations is important because of the strategic role Egypt plays in the
future of Sudan.  &igrave;How will Sudan deal with this crisis&icirc; will
be the title of the next episode on Sudan&iacute;s battle of survival.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty Denounces Detention of Tunisian </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Opposition Leader at Frankfurt Airport</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>London- Liberty for the Muslim World denounced the detention
on 19 June, of a Tunisian opposition leader by the German security authorities
at Frankfurt Airport. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A report issued by the London-based organization which
watches the human rights in the Muslim World said the German security officials
arrested on 5 June, the Tunisian journalist and political opposition leader
Al-Habib Al-Mukni who was on a routine journalistic visit to Germany. Mr.
Al-Mukni is the editor in chief of Al-Insan periodical, which is published
in Paris, is a founding and leading member of the Tunisian Ennahda (Renaissance)
Party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Liberty for the Muslim World fears for the well-being
of Mr. Al-Mukni who, as past experience has shown, is likely to have been
arrested in response to an extradition request from the authorities in his
own country, Tunisia,&quot; said the report adding that for the past several
years, enormous pressures have been exerted by the Tunisian government on
European governments as well as on those of the United States and Canada
to urge them to expel or extradite Tunisians suspected of opposing the regime
in Tunis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Al-Mukni is 45 years old, married and has three children.
He has been living in the French capital for several years since his request
for asylum was granted by the French government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;While strongly condemning the detention of Mr. Al-Mukni,
Liberty for the Muslim World calls for his immediate release and appeals
to the French authorities, whose travel document is appropriately issued
by them, to intervene with the German authorities in order to secure his
release and safe return to his place of residence. Any attempt by the Tunisian
regime to extradite him against his will to Tunisia should be resisted,&quot;
stressed the report.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty pointed out that scores of Tunisians suspected
of opposition to the current regime in Tunisia are subjected to harassment
and threats of deportation every year throughout the European continent.
&quot;The Tunisian government has  benefited from the security cooperation
agreement it has signed with various European governments, and has thus
been pressuring them to  extradite or expel its opponents,&quot; it added.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Algeria's Military-Prescribed Democracy is
a Mockery- Liberty</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty for the Muslim World is of the opinion that the
current 'democratic' exercise in Algeria is futile, a report issued by the
London-based Islamic human rights organization. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;By holding the parliamentary elections, the Algerian
military authorities only seek to consolidate their control and legitimise
their hegemony in the name of democracy. At least sixty thousand Algerians
have lost their lives for the military junta's project to materialise, namely
the project of establishing a system of governance that is above questioning
or checking,&quot; said Liberty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Clearly, the current exercise has been designed,
and was only permitted to proceed, in order to give rise to a rubber stamp
parliament. The 'elected'  council would be expected to endorse the policies
dictated by a minority  regime born out of a coup against the will of the
public as it became clear that the only fair and clean democratic process
- not only in the history of Algeria but in the history of the entire Arab
region - was bound to transfer power from a corrupt minority that sunk the
whole country in heaps of  foreign debt to the duly elected representatives
of the people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty's report went on to say that &quot;the most obvious
indication of the futility of the exercise is that it is taking place in
circumstances where terrorising and killing civilians has not for a moment
abated; where several thousands of Algerians suspected of opposing the military
regime lavish in crowded detention centres, including  the elected representatives
of the people in the canceled 1991 elections; where thousands of Algerians
have fled persecution and are now forced to live in exile; where heavy restrictions
are imposed on political activities; where human rights are violated on
massive scale; and where freedom of expression is confiscated. What purpose
would such elections serve other than to maintain the status quo, especially
as the largest and most popular political party, the Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS), continues to be banned and excluded from the process?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty for the Muslim World sees that the holding of the
elections in such an atmosphere only confirms the suspicion that the new
era will be none but an extension of the previous one. &quot;It is indeed
regrettable that the leaders of participating political parties have failed
to see that the generals who intervened in order to ban and destroy FIS
will not hesitate to  intervene once more if they feel that the interests
of the minority they represent are being threatened. Undoubtedly, the interests
of the elite which squandered national funds and ruled the majority by terror
are incompatible with the interests of the people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report concluded by saying that &quot;the sudden birth
of a political party that represents the ruling elite is a clear indication
that Algeria is heading toward a future dominated by a single party dictatorship
of the type that existed when the National Liberation Front (FLN) was the
only political party in the country, acting for several decades as a political
platform for the military junta.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty Concerned Over Fate of</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>130 (Chinese) Muslim Refugees in Pakistan</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty for the Muslim World expressed its deeply concern
over the fate of about 130 Uighur Muslim students (normally inhabitants
of Zinjiang province which is currently under Chinese rule) who have fled
Chinese persecution and sought refuge in Pakistan. Liberty also strongly
condemned the Pakistani government's decision on 13 May 1997 to extradite
to China, upon the official request of its government, 12 such students
who were all immediately executed by the Chinese authorities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Pakistani  government is thus held responsible
for the death of these students for having agreed to hand them over despite
knowing they would be executed,&quot; a report issued by the Islamic human
rights organization said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Muslims of Zinjiang province have always suffered
discrimination and their human rights have been severely violated so much
so that the persecution is believed to amount to a slow genocide with the
objective of replacing the indigenous Uighur population with a Chinese one.
 It is estimated that the Chinese population of the province has increased
from 2.5% in 1944, when the province was annexed to China, to 30% at the
present. Thus, the indigenous population has felt threatened and several
political initiatives have been made to demand respect for human rights
and the recognition of the Muslim majority's right to self-determination.
The freedom movement is particularly popular among the students. Local sources
say that sixty thousand students suspected of involvement in political activities
are currently imprisoned by the Chinese authorities.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty for the Muslim World feared that the Pakistani
authorities &quot;will once again succumb to Chinese demands and hand over
the Uighur Muslim refugees, who would certainly meet the same fate their
extradited colleagues met before.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Some Pakistani media has recently published the names
of the 12 students who were executed upon extradition. They are as follows:
1) Abdullah     2) Abdurrashid  3) Abdussamad   4) Muhammad Ali 5)Muhammad
Karim      6) Abulqasim    7) Abdurrahim   8) Muhammad </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yassin      9) Abdussalam     10) Mur Ali     11) Abdullah
   12)Muhammad Trawi</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty appealed to the Pakistani President, the Pakistani
Prime Minister and all concerned Pakistani officials to cease the practice
of extraditing political refugees to China. &quot;For by agreeing to extradite
the refugees, Pakistan sentences  them to death, as if it were the judge
while China played the role of the executioner,&quot; said Liberty.  It
called upon all human rights organisations and on local and international
Islamic associations to &quot;intervene so as to persuade the Pakistani
authorities to reconsider its policy of security cooperation with China,
a policy that clearly involves the violation of the most basic human right,
the right to life.&quot;</FONT></P>
