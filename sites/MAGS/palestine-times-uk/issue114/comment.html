<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">&#147;God&#146;s Lying People&#148;</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>Lying has always been an intrinsic value among Zionist Jews, so much
that Zionists from Theodore Hertzel to Ehud Barak can be considered the world&#146;s most
premier liars. In fact, it is extremely difficult to cite even a single believer in
Zionism who is not clean of lies. In short, Zionism is a movement based on lies; its
history is congested with lies cemented with bloodshed.<br>
Take for example Golda Meir, the infamous former Israeli premier, who once claimed that
the Palestinian people didn&#146;t exist. The evil woman insisted that Palestine was a
land without a people for a people without a land.<br>
The lie did gain currency in the West, where the mass media are controlled by Jews, and
where big lies as such are converted into &#147;truths&#148; glorified by millions.<br>
Sometimes, Zionist mendacity goes to far-fetched extents. A few years ago, for example,
some Zionists claimed that it was the Hebrews who built the Pyramids in Egypt during the
reigns of the pharos. This wasn&#146;t strange, coming from the very people who claimed
that a Jewish Patriarch overpowered the all-omnipotent and dragged Him to the ground, the
very same people who teach their kids that a rabbi argued with God and eventually refuted
the Almighty&#146;s argument.<br>
In 1997, Zionists came up with another cardinal lie. Seeking to legitimize their illegal
usurpation of Jerusalem, they claimed that Jerusalem was founded by the Israelites 3000
years ago, implying that the city had not existed prior to King Solomon. Thus, the long
and rich history of the Jebusites and other Cannanite tribes who founded and populated the
city from 5000 BC to 2000 BC was so lightly scrapped into oblivion through one more crafty
lie by the professional liars.<br>
The Zionists never tire of concocting lies, especially when the lies happen to serve their
interests. Their lie-producing mills seem to work round-the-clock.<br>
Now we are told that many Palestinian parents hate their own children, so much that they
send them to hurl stones at Israeli occupation soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
order to get killed.<br>
The nefarious lie is relentlessly disseminated throughout the world, especially in the
West, in order to justify, or at least mitigate the evil of ongoing Zionist atrocities
perpetrated against defenseless Palestinian men, women and children whose only crime is
their enduring desire to be free of Zionist barbarism.<br>
Unfortunately, the big lie occasionally finds its way through to the unquestioning minds
of some gullible Europeans, such as the queen of Sweden, who publicly lamented the utter
lack of compassion on the part of Palestinian mothers toward their children.<br>
And in America, the lie is almost readily accepted as an undisputed reality, given the
absolute Jewish grip on the media and the show business. <br>
So the twisted logic serves the Zionists&#146; original malicious purpose, namely the
dehumanization of the Palestinian people and the justification of the killing of their
children and the arrogation of their rights and land by Zionist Jews.<br>
Thus, the trigger-happy killers who shoot to kill and aim at the upper parts of the
children bodies are civilized soldiers innocent of any guilt, and the nefarious kids, who
threat the safety of the soldiers, are the guilty ones since they purposefully intrude
into the firing range of the sharpshooters.<br>
It is not easy to respond to this kind of virulent lies which emanate from a virulent
mentality and which epitomizes racism and embodies evil in its most sinister way. It is a
mentality that is so prone to evil that it is useless to appeal to its human senses of
justice and simple fairness. They have non of that.<br>
For how could a normal mentality, with the minimal of intellectual honesty, claim that a
child who may be playing in the backyard of his home, or in his school&#146;s playground,
or siting in the veranda of his home, is blamed for his own death because he or his mother
didn&#146;t make sure that he stayed out of the Zionists&#146; firing line.<br>
Indeed, if, for the sake of argument, one was to give the big lie some consideration, one
would eventually come to the conclusion that virtually all Palestinians are effectively in
the range of Zionist bullets and that in order that they dot not get killed, they would
have to leave their homeland entirely so that they may prove to God&#146;s lying people
that they don&#146;t hate themselves and their children.<br>
But Palestinian hate, we are made to believe by God&#146;s lying people, goes far beyond
children. <br>
Palestinians also hate their own houses, this is why they allow these houses to be
demolished by Israeli army bulldozers.<br>
The Palestinians also hate their live orchards and vineyards, by allowing these to be
destroyed and uprooted by Israeli occupation army.<br>
And, ultimately, the Palestinians probably hate their own homeland, which explains the
fact that they didn&#146;t withstand more Zionist massacres when the Jewish state was
created in 1948.<br>
In brief, there seems to be no limit to what God&#146;s lying people are capable of
fabricating.<br>
Sometimes, one gets the impression that the story of Isaac, his two sons Jacob and Esau
and their mother Rebecca is reproduced every day by Zionist mill of mendacity..all for the
purpose of hallowing the unholy, glorifying the lie and legitimizing the illegitimate.<br>
Esau and Muhammed Durra must have much in common. </p>
