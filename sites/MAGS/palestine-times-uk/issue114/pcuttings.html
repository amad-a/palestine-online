    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The downfall of Ehud Barak's battered minority government comes as little
    surprise to Israel and its neighbours. There is inevitably much interest in what will
    happen in the four or five months which, in the convoluted Israeli system, will precede
    the next election. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jerusalem Post is scathing about Barak's record in office, but is in
    no doubt about who ultimately is to blame for the crisis: &quot;Prime minister Ehud Barak,
    in his speech to the knesset plenum last night, was wrong to place the blame on the
    opposition for the house's decision to go to the polls ..</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">.. In Yasser Arafat's Palestinian authority, the notion of the nation's
    leader paying the political price for a failed policy is simply unheard of. Challenges to
    Arafat's rule are few and far between, and his numerous internal security forces make sure
    that it stays that way.&quot; </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Financial Times, 29 November 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel was last night thrown into political turmoil when parliament voted
    for early elections after Ehud Barak, the prime minister, said that he was ready to face
    the people. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I am not afraid of elections,&quot; said a confident Mr Barak.
    &quot;I have proved what my government has done. If you want elections, I am
    prepared.&quot; </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The campaign - which is set to begin once the main parties decide the
    election date in the next few days - is expected to plunge the country into a bitter
    struggle over what kind of peace is possible with the Palestinians. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Los Angeles Times, 27 November 2000 </font></b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The Israelis continue to insist that the violence in the West Bank
    and Gaza Strip must dramatically diminish before real peace negotiations can resume. But
    clashes in the territories, which have become a daily ritual since Sept. 28, continued. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..&nbsp;Israeli military intelligence warned that an upsurge in the
    violence that already has claimed more than 250 lives, most of them Arab, could be
    expected during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins today. Israeli officials
    have said that if violent demonstrations and attacks on soldiers and settlers in the West
    Bank and Gaza Strip subside, Israel will lift its closure of those territories. Muslims
    traditionally come to Jerusalem to pray at Al Aqsa mosque in the Old City during Ramadan,
    a time of fasting and prayer. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Independent, 27 November 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Sayed Hassan Nasrallah, the Hizbollah chairman, stated on Saturday that
    the Shebaa farms could be recovered only by fighting. Mr Annan claimed the territory lay
    outside the &quot;blue line&quot; and that its ownership should be decided in subsequent
    talks between Syria and Lebanon. But Syria said the farms did belong to Lebanon, and thus
    opened a breach in the border withdrawal agreement that would allow further conflict along
    the frontier. That battle has now begun. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Daily Telegraph, 24 November 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli army is tightening the noose around Palestinian towns with a
    blockade which has become an effective means of economic warfare.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">All over the West Bank, the Israeli army has placed concrete blocks or dug
    ditches along side roads to cut off towns. Army checkpoints are under orders to allow only
    humanitarian deliveries through, but these are often held back for &quot;security
    reasons&quot;.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">From the main roads you can see Palestinian taxis bumping their way over
    fields to find an exit. Petrol is already running short in the Gaza Strip, and an
    estimated 38 per cent of Palestinians - many of whom used to work inside Israel - are out
    of a job. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Ha&#146;aretz, 24 November 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The intense political activity, which has as its objective the formation
    of an emergency government, could create an impression that the parties of the right have
    a magic solution to the war in the territories - a solution which Barak is not aware of.
    The assertions of the leaders of the right, as voiced in their media appearances and at a
    right-wing demonstration on Wednesday night in Jerusalem, are directed mainly against what
    they describe as the weakness of the Barak government, because it is not willing to adopt
    a harsher policy toward the Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The right, under the banner of &quot;Let the IDF win,&quot; is demanding
    that unrestricted and unlimited warfare be waged against the Palestinians and, in the
    words of Yisrael Ba'aliya leader Natan Sharansky, that the IDF &quot;destroy, demolish,
    and obliterate the officers, staffs and bases of the criminal organizations responsible
    for terrorist attacks.&quot; MK Rehavam Ze'evi of the National Union-Yisrael Beitenu goes
    further and advocates kidnapping or killing members of the Palestinian leadership.
    Herut-National Movement MK Michael Kleiner thinks only a recapture of the territories can
    eliminate terrorism.</p>
