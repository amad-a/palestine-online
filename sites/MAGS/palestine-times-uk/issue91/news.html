<h3><center>Palestinians call Clinton &quot;mass killer of children&quot;</center></h3>

<p><br>
<b><i>From Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Less than 48 hours after U.S. President
Bill Clinton ended his &quot;historical visit&quot; to the Palestinian
self-rule areas, during which he was accorded an impressive but
largely sycophant reception by the Palestinian Authority, thousands
of angry Palestinians took to the streets, torching and trampling
on American flags and chanting &quot;death to America.&quot; The
widespread anger over the Anglo-American bombing of Iraq was obvious
throughout the West Bank and to a lesser degree in the Gaza Strip
where the police grip is tighter.</p>

<p>Some of the angriest protests took place in Nablus, the largest
West Bank town, where thousands of townspeople marched through
the town's main thoroughfare following the Friday congregational
prayer on 18 December.</p>

<p>The protesters chanted &quot;America is the enemy of Islam&quot;,
&quot;Stop the Anglo-American genocide against the Iraqi people&quot;
and &quot;God will avenge the blood of Iraqi children&quot;. Several
speakers accused Clinton of ordering the bombing in order to enhance
his image in the United States ahead of the impeachment hearing
against him in the American Congress.</p>

<p>&quot;It is lamentable that Arab and Muslim blood has become
the perfect prescription for gaining popularity in the West&quot;,
said the imam of al Naser Mosque in Nablus. He pointed out the
widespread American public support for the bombing of Iraq and
the killing of innocent Iraqis saying, &quot;the American people
are no better than their leadership&#133;the scene of mutilated
bodies protruding from the rubble.&quot;</p>

<p>In Ramallah, the anti-American protests turned especially nasty
when Israeli soldiers manning roadblocks outside the Jewish settlement
of Pisgat Zeiv opened fire on the protesters, many of whom were
Beir Zeit University students. One protester, Muhammed Dawoud,
was fatally wounded, reportedly by a live bullet.</p>

<p>In Hebron, several thousand Palestinians also changed &quot;death
to America&quot; and &quot;death to Britain&quot; on 19 December,
the third day of the Anglo-American bombing of Iraq. Again, they
set on fire American flags and portraits of President Clinton
and carried signs reading &quot;Clinton: killer of Iraqi children.&quot;</p>

<p>Many Palestinians, as indeed Arabs and Muslims everywhere,
were particularly enraged by President Clinton's remarks that
he ordered the bombing of Iraq four days ahead of the holy month
of Ramadan because he didn't want to injure Muslim feelings by
starting the operation &quot;Desert Fox&quot; at the beginning
of the Muslim month of fasting.</p>

<p>&quot;Does the American playboy think that the killing of innocent
people is permissible during the other eleven months of the year
and only inadmissible in Ramadan?&quot; said Sheik Rafik al Khatib,
imam of the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron.</p>

<p>Indeed, much of the public anger in the occupied territory
at the bombing was directed at the &quot;disgraceful and treacherous
Arab leaders.&quot; One slogan that repeated itself over and over
again during the protests was &quot;Arab leaders, today is Iraq,
tomorrow will be your turn.&quot;</p>

<p>In Hebron, for example, protesters carried placards caricaturing
Uncle Sam asking &quot;Who's next?&quot;, having slaughtered a
man embodying Iraq. </p>

<p>Some of the Palestinians' fury at the bombing was directed
at the Arab masses for their &quot;deafening dormancy.&quot; <br>
&quot;If all Arabs and Muslims do as we do (setting American flags
on fire), said one Palestinian protester in Nablus, &quot;America
will think twice before bombing Baghdad or Khartoum.&quot;</p>

<p><b><u>Official Reaction</u></b></p>

<p>The Anglo-American bombing of Iraq placed the Palestinian Authority,
particularly its chairman Yasser Arafat, in a very embarrassing
situation in the sight of the Palestinian public opinion.</p>

<p>The reason is very clear. In Gaza and later in Bethlehem, Arafat
poured wholesome praise on Clinton, describing him as &quot;the
greatest friend of the Palestinian people&quot;, and &quot;the
messenger of peace&quot;.</p>

<p>In addition, Arafat and other key PA officials issued statements
expressing a feeling of euphoria toward the visit by Clinton,
and suggesting that the United States was at least tacitly recognizing
Palestinian Statehood.</p>

<p>The false euphoria reached the point where one Fatah official,
Abbas Zaki, claimed that &quot;now the Palestinian State has been
established.&quot;</p>

<p>Another Palestinian leader, Legislative Council speaker Ahmed
Qrey, went as far as saying that &quot;Clinton is now our ally.&quot;<br>
Prisoners end hunger strike.</p>

<p>Having realized that the PA is utterly powerless to get the
Israeli Prime Minister to release them, or at least the 750 of
them as the PA claims is stipulated in the Wye memorandum, the
estimated 2,500 Palestinian political (or security) prisoners
held in Israeli jails ended their strike on the second day of
President Clinton's visit to the autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p>The hunger strike lasted for nearly ten days, during which
widespread protests in solidarity with the strikers took place,
resulting in the death of five Palestinians who were killed during
clashes with Israeli soldiers along the so-called friction lines
in Ramallah and Jenin. Hundreds of protesters were also injured
by rubber-coated bullets, the chief means used by the Israeli
army to disperse &quot;Arab&quot; demonstrators.</p>

<p>The termination of the hunger strike was mainly the result
of a combination of &quot;a feeling of betrayal&quot; on the part
of the prisoners toward the Palestinian Authority and the fact
that there was no prospect of Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu changing his mind on the issue.</p>

<p>Never the less, it expected that the struggle for the release
of the prisoners will resume after the end of the month of Ramadan,
in the prisons and especially on the streets of the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<h3><center>Palestinians waged &quot;Prisoners' Intifadah&quot;</center></h3>

<p><b><i>Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</i></b></p>

<p> Mass demonstrations protesting Israel's dogged refusal to
release Palestinian political prisoners were held throughout the
West Bank, embarrassing the Palestinian Authority and placing
additional strains on the already precarious Wye River memorandum.<br>
Thus, thousands of Palestinians, particularly the relatives of
some 2,500 political prisoners (Israel calls them security prisoners),
marched in the streets of major Palestinian towns and held rallies
and sit-ins outside Red Cross and Red Crescent offices, demanding
the release of the prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The protesters vowed not to rest until all prisoners were released
irrespective of their political affiliations.</p>

<p>Moreover, sporadic clashes with Israeli soldiers manning roadblocks
outside PA-controlled towns resulted in scores of mostly light
injuries sustained by rubber-coated bullets fired by the soldiers.</p>

<p>On 7 December, one Palestinian boy from the town of Abu Dis
near Jerusalem was taken to hospital brain-dead when an Israeli
settler shot him in the head, reportedly after stones were hurled
at the settler's car.</p>

<p>The boy, Naser Ureikat, died two days later at the Makased
Islamic hospital in East Jerusalem. </p>

<p>Earlier, a 40-year-old Palestinian, Osama al Natshe, was stabbed
to death apparently by a Haredi Jewish killer in the Thuri neighbourhood
in East Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Israeli police sources said the perpetrator, still at large,
was a serial killer who earlier this year killed another Palestinian
and tried to kill four others.</p>

<p>Palestinian leaders in East Jerusalem blamed the Israeli authorities
for not paying serious attention to Jewish terrorism against Arabs.</p>

<p>&quot;If my brother had been Jewish, the Israelis would have
carried out so many arrests and closed off the area,&quot; said
Yousef Natshe, the victim's brother.</p>

<p>Faisal Husseini reminded the Israeli Government that they had
terrorists in their midst and had better come to terms with the
fact that there are far more Jews with Arab blood on their hands
than Arabs with Jewish blood on their hands.</p>

<p>Ahead of President Clinton's visit, two more Palestinians were
killed when trigger-happy Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinian
protesters at the northern entrance of al Bireh, opposite the
Jewish settlement of Pisgad Zeiv.</p>

<p>A fifth Palestinian, Muhammed Dawoud, 19, was killed by Israeli
bullets at the same location on 17 December, bringing the number
of Palestinians killed in December to five.</p>

<p>As many as 500 people were injured, mostly by rubber bullets
and often by live rounds fired from M-16 rifles.<br>
Israeli hostages as bargaining chips?</p>

<p>While most of the steam of Palestinian protests in solidarity
with prisoners targeted Israeli &quot;deception and cheating&quot;,
harsh criticisms were also leveled against the Palestinian leadership
for its &quot;lax and undetermined stance on the issue.&quot;</p>

<p>On 6 December, the solidarity campaign on behalf of the prisoners
gathered momentum, as the prisoners themselves decided to go on
an open-ended hunger strike until &quot;freedom or martyrdom&quot;.</p>

<p>In letters smuggled from the Nafha prison, the prisoners castigated
the PA, accusing its leaders, particularly Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen), of &quot;betraying us and indulging in a dirty game of
lies and deceit.&quot;</p>

<p>To dramatize their indignation with the PA leadership, the
prisoners urged Palestinian policemen to disobey their superiors'
orders and abduct Israeli soldiers and settlers to force the Israeli
Government to free them.</p>

<p>&quot;Israel&quot;, they said, &quot;understands only the language
of force and without force none of us will be ever freed.&quot;</p>

<p>To illustrate their point further, the prisoners pointed out
that in 1985, the Israeli Government agreed to free 1,150 Palestinian
prisoners, many of them with double and triple imprisonment sentences
for life for killing Israeli soldiers and civilians in return
for a few Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>Hence, the prisoners' message to the Palestinians was blunt
and direct: &quot;Take hostages, kidnap soldiers or settlers,
do anything that will force the Zionists to free us because we
have nothing to lose but our captivity.&quot;</p>

<p>The call for taking Israeli hostages and using them as bargaining
chips to force Netanyahu to change course was apparently made
by Islamist prisoners who make up over 75% of Palestinian political-security
prisoners in Israeli jails. Those, it seems, have little or no
chance of being released, first because of Israel's almost total
rejection to release them under any circumstances, and second
because they are never on Yasser Arafat's priority list, as Hamas
is the PA's ultimate political rival.<br>
Hence, the pressure on Hamas to take action to force the Israeli
Government to release its prisoners is likely to increase substantially,
especially if and when Fatah prisoners, particularly those &quot;with
Jewish blood on their hands&quot;, are released as part of a possible
compromise between the Israeli Government and the PA leadership
which could be brokered by the Americans.</p>

<p>Needless to say, however, if Fatah prisoners are indeed allowed
to go home while Hamas prisoners are not, as has been the norm
so far, the Palestinian public opinion will come to view any action
by Hamas to secure the release of its prisoners, e.g. kidnapping
Israeli soldiers, as perfectly legitimate and understandable.</p>

<p><b><u>Arafat's dilemma</u></b></p>

<p>The widespread solidarity with the prisoners, which can be
viewed as a silent popular vote of no confidence in the PA leadership,
seems to have taken Yasser Arafat by surprise. Arafat hoped the
Wye River agreement, which he considered a great victory and a
monumental achievement, would rally the bulk of the Palestinian
people to his side. However, the prisoners' issue apparently spoiled
the atmosphere for Arafat and served to deny him the opportunity
to enjoy the fruits of the agreement.<br>
Faced with the vociferous cries of the prisoners' relatives, and
the embittered accusations that he let his soldiers down, Arafat
et al. were forced into the defensive. He argued that the Israeli
Prime Minister had agreed to release political prisoners, not
common criminals and petty thieves, adding that the Americans,
and President Clinton personally, were witnesses to the fact.
To this, Netanyahu retorted, accusing Arafat of lying to his people
by saying that Israel promised to release &quot;murderers of our
people.&quot;</p>

<p>The truth of the matter, however, is that the wording of the
clauses pertaining to the prisoners, or the so-called &quot;side
letters&quot;, was general and vague, probably deliberately, to
allow each party to interpret them to his satisfaction and, therefore,
avoid the collapse of the talks. This pattern of &quot;constructive
vagueness&quot; or &quot;delayed crises&quot; has characterized
all accords and agreements reached between Israel and the PLO
from the DOP in Oslo to the Wye River memorandum in Maryland,
enabling the powerful party, Israel, to impose its will and interpretation
on the weaker party, the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>Never the less, unlike previous occasions whereby Arafat managed
to maintain a certain degree of harmony between policy requirements
(e.g. getting Israel to redeploy its army from more land in the
West Bank) and the need to keep a respectable level of public
support, especially among Fatah, the backbone of his regime, this
time the PA Chairman seems to face a definite dilemma. For, on
the one hand, if he chose to ride the wave and champion the prisoners'
cause, he would risk causing a sharp crisis with Israel (that
crisis seems already at hand) and handing Prime Minister Netanyahu
an easy excuse to suspend or terminate the implementation of the
two remaining phases of the Wye River memorandum, slated to include
Israeli redeployment from 10% of the West Bank in the central
and southern parts of the West Bank.</p>

<p>On the other hand, should Arafat turn his back to the outpouring
of emotions in the wider Palestinian street, he would risk losing
the support and confidence of the masses at a crucial time, less
than six months before the designated date for the declaration
of Palestinian Statehood.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are signs that many Palestinians, especially
the more educated segments, are not giving Arafat the benefit
of the doubt.</p>

<p>Ten days ago, Hamas supporters at al Najah National University,
the largest college in the West Bank and an erstwhile Fatah stronghold,
defeated Arafat's supporters very badly, succeeding for the first
time in controlling the college's student council without having
to form coalitions with any non-Islamist factions.</p>

<p>Hamas, along with its junior ally, the Islamic Jihad, received
42 seats of the 81-seat student assembly, with the pro-Fatah Shabiba
movement receiving only 35 seats and the increasingly receding
leftist camp receiving 3 seats.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Arafat and his PA stand to lose more than
just students' votes. Fatah itself is undergoing a certain change
that is not to Arafat's liking. On 7 December, Fatah supporters
clashed with PA policemen in Nablus following the arrest by police
of a Fatah cadet during a demonstration in solidarity with the
prisoners the same day.</p>

<p>Angry Fatah supporters torched a bus and two other vehicles
belonging to the police, overran a police station, and hurled
petrol bombs at the main prison in downtown Nablus.</p>

<p>The confrontations, during which fire arms were used, continued
well into the night, resulting in 12 casualties, one of them serious.</p>

<p>The arrest of the Fatah cadet by the police was only the spark
that triggered off the violence. The real underlying causes, most
of which are still dormant, lie in the deep sense of alienation
felt by many Fatah rank and file toward the so-called the returnees,
e.g. those who came with Yasser Arafat from Tunis upon the establishment
of the PA.</p>

<p>Those returnees, the local often complain, received the main
jobs, arrogated (or embezzled) most of the money, and virtually
formed a new rrogant and filthy-rich caste, often looking down
at &quot;the people of the inside&quot;, who provided the fuel
of the intifadah and made Arafat's return possible.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, one Palestinian, Wisam al Tarifi, was killed
in Ramallah when Mukhabarat cadres opened fire at a peaceful Fatah
rally protesting a Mukhabarat raid on the movement's offices in
the town.</p>

<p>It is widely believed that the recurrence of &quot;fights between
Fatah and 'sulta' (the authority) could eventually seriously weaken
Yasser Arafat, especially if Fatah leaders who don't act at Arafat's
beck and call, such as Marwan Kanafani and Husam Khader, decide
to cooperate with Hamas, to put a common stand against Authority
repression.</p>

<p>The street protests over the prisoners' release, the unraveling
strains with the Palestinian Authority, and the increasing frequency
of violent and bloody acts of violence on both Arab and Jewish
sides, all seem to suggest that the worst is yet to come. If one
adds to this the current spate of Israeli settlement expansion,
along with the Israeli threat to confiscate the bulk of the West
Bank in case Arafat makes good on his promise to declare Palestinian
Statehood in six months' time, it becomes almost a foregone conclusion
that a real showdown, perhaps a new intifadah, may be in the making.</p>

<h3><center>Israel to go to early elections in April</center></h3>

<p><b><i>From Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> In an atmosphere of acrimony and
divisiveness, the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, voted overwhelmingly
on 21 December to dissolve itself and hold early general elections,
throwing the Middle East peace process into uncertainty.</p>

<p>The bill passed to that effect will still have to go through
its second and third readings, but observers note that this will
be done smoothly since the bulk of Israeli law makers from both
the ruling coalition and the opposition (81 out of 120) voted
in favour of the bill.</p>

<p>The designated date of the elections has yet to be decided
through agreement among the main political parties.</p>

<p>However, Israeli sources suggest the date will be somewhere
between the 10th of March and the 20th of April.</p>

<p>The dissolution of the Israeli parliament followed months of
political wrangling, both within the hard-line but fragile coalition
headed by Benyamin Netanyahu and between the coalition and the
opposition led by Labour Party leader Ehud Barak.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seemed that most, if not all, political factions
across the Israeli arena, including the hardcore Likud stalwarts,
were becoming fed up with the Netanyahu Government and, probably,
with Netanyahu himself.</p>

<p>This is why erstwhile ardent supporters, such as Communications
Minister Limor Livnat, decided to abandon him, either to run independently
for Prime Minister or to form a new ultra-rightist political faction
along with such jingoistic hard-liners as Benny Begin and Michael
Kliener, leader of the so-called &quot;Land of Israel Front&quot;.</p>

<p>But the most serious opposition to Netanyahu from within the
Likud so far has come from Dan Merridor, who on Tuesday 22 December
announced he was a candidate for Prime Minister and was forming
a new centrist party, possibly in coalition with such increasingly
popular figures as the former chief of staff of the Israeli army,
Amnon Shahak.</p>

<p>Announcing his candidacy, Merridor lashed out at Netanyahu,
accusing him of displaying &quot;poor Statesmanship&quot; and
&quot;failing miserably in every conceivable sphere of public
service.&quot;</p>

<p>Merridor pointed out that under Netanyahu Israel had been plagued
by a host of political, economic and social problems, which, he
said, Netanyahu either failed to deal with or exacerbated through
incompetent leadership and poor Statesmanship.<br>
With his Likud camp in disarray, Netanyahu sought, rather belatedly,
to gain time by suggesting the formation of a national Government
with the Labour Party.</p>

<p>This suggestion, said Netanyahu, came at the advice and urging
of his Defense Minister Yitshak Mordechai and the leader of Shas,
Arie Deri'e.</p>

<p>However, the stratagem did not work as it was rejected outright
by Barak, who called the suggestion &quot;a trick that came too
late.&quot;<br>
Seeing that his horizons have been narrowed as probably never
before, Netanyahu headed for electioneering right before the Knesset
voted to dissolve itself, effectively bringing his Government
down. </p>

<p>In a speech that was interrupted and heckled numerous times
by right- and left-wingers alike, the Israeli premier displayed
characteristic insolence in the hope that this would rally, or
re-rally, the Israeli right-with its secular and religious wings-around
him as was the case in the last general election.</p>

<p>He pointed out that he succeeded in lowering Palestinian expectations
from the peace process and that, thanks to his determination to
stand by his principles, the Palestinians came to realize that
Israel would never compromise on her vital interests.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Netanyahu pointed out that he was suspending the
implementation of the remaining parts of the Wye River memorandum
until the Palestinian Authority met a set of Israeli preconditions
and demands, including terminating plans to declare Palestinian
Statehood by May of next year, fighting incitement, collecting
illegal firearms, reducing the number of the PA police force and
stopping the demand that Israel release Palestinian political
prisoners whom he called &quot;blood-stained murderers.&quot;</p>

<p>Continuing the charade, Netanyahu pointed out in a rather tendentious
manner that &quot;if these policies were unacceptable, it would
be better to go to the people and let them decide.&quot;</p>

<p>Responding to Netanyahu, Labour Party leader Ehud Barak lambasted
the Government, saying it failed and reached a dead-end, not only
from the political viewpoint, but from the moral viewpoint as
well.</p>

<p>Barak said Israel could no longer accept a Government that
continues to be responsible to extremist pressure groups, while
utterly ignoring and neglecting the bulk of the people.</p>

<p>However, Barak appealed to the hardcore Jewish population,
saying that the Labour Party would never agree to re-divide Jerusalem,
to return to the borders of 1967, and would seek to leave the
overwhelming majority of Jewish settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip under Israeli sovereignty.</p>

<p>Finally, Barak repeated his prescription for achieving personal
security for Israelis, saying the solution for most security problems
was &quot;afrada&quot; or separation, total separation between
Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

<p><b><u>The Peace Process</u></b></p>

<p>The peace process, particularly the Wye River memorandum signed
under direct American sponsorship on 23 October in Maryland, is
likely to be the first and premier victim of the new political
development in Israel.</p>

<p>Israeli sources have indicated that the peace process and the
implementation of the Wye memorandum will be frozen for at least
six months, presumably until a new Israeli Government is formed.</p>

<p>The United States, Egypt and particularly the Palestinian Authority,
have urged the Israeli Government not to suspend the implementation
of the Wye agreement.</p>

<p>In this context, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat appealed to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, the sole sponsor of the Wye agreement,
to see that Israel implement it, given the fact that the Palestinians
had already done their part.</p>

<p>However, it is unlikely that either Clinton or Netanyahu will
be very receptive to any appeal to that effect, given the impeachment
proceedings against Clinton in Washington and the election fever
in Israel.</p>

<h3><center>Hamas military leader escapes from Gaza prison</center></h3>

<p><br>
<b>Gaza-</b> Palestinian informed sources said that a leader of
Ezzul-Deen Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance
Movement, Hamas, fled his prison in Gaza. The sources added that
Adnan Al Ghoul, who had been arrested by the Palestinian Authority's
Secret Service (Mukhabarat) in Gaza for 18 months, succeeded in
escaping from his prison. His escape put the PA's security forces
on the alert, especially since it came just a few days before
the visit to Gaza by U.S. President Clinton. The sources pointed
out that the PA made contact with the Zionist security establishments
and the CIA in order to arrest him as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ismael Abu Shanab, a Hamas leader in Gaza, expressed
fear for the life of Mr. Al Ghoul. &quot;What happened to Al Ghoul
reminds us of the assassination of brothers Adel and Emad Awadallah
last September, which was carried out in a similar way,&quot;
Abu Shanab said.</p>

<p>Emad Awadallah was arrested by the PA's Preventive Security
and incarcerated in Jericho's prison before the PA announced his
escape. A few days later, the Israelis said they spotted and killed
Emad and his brother Adel, the number-one wanted Palestinian by
the Israelis, in a house located near Hebron of the West Bank.
It was believed that the PA's Preventive Security let Emad escape
from his prison after planting a micro-bugging device on his body
to spot him.</p>

<p>Abu Shanab called on the PA to seriously investigate the incident.
He also warned that &quot;any attempt on the lives of our Mujahideen
(fighters) would be considered an escalation which Israel and
the CIA should be held responsible for.&quot;</p>

<p>The Palestinian sources warned that Al Ghoul's escape could
be a planned tactic to watch him and to spot the Qassam Brigades'
leader, Mohammed Dief, who is on the top of the list wanted by
the Israeli security forces. Mohammed Dief, who has been in hiding
for several years, is described as dangerous and the &quot;No.
1&quot; wanted by the Israelis, who accuse him of being responsible
for various bombings, the sources said.</p>

<h3><center>Palestinian Journalists protest police harassment
and brutality</center></h3>

<p><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> scores of Palestinian journalists
demonstrated in Gaza Tuesday afternoon to protest PA police brutality
and harassment.</p>

<p>The Journalists, who included cameramen and photojournalists,
carried signs reading &quot;police is killing freedom of the press,&quot;
&quot;what happened to press freedom,&quot; and &quot;where is
the law.&quot;</p>

<p>The journalists pointed out that policemen from the so-called
&quot;Rapid Intervention Police&quot; leaped on journalists last
week, beating them and destroying their tools.</p>

<p>The PA accused the journalists of &quot;covering an illegal
demonstrations that jeopardize national interests and endanger
relations with a friendly country (the United States).&quot;</p>

<p>At least eight private radio and television stations in the
West Bank were shut off for forty eight hours for &quot;over covering
anti-American demonstrations&quot; in the West Bank.</p>

<p>More to the point, PA police instructed all private TV and
radio stations not to confine their news programs to &quot;local
news&quot; and to stop &quot;re-airing programs from satellite
television stations.&quot;</p>

<p>The suppressive measures, observers believe, are aimed at muzzling
the anti-American sentiments now engulfing much of the Palestinian
enclaves following recent US and British bombing of Iraq.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian Journalists Association in Gaza
decided to continue their strike in protest against the detention
by the PA police of eight Palestinian reporters and the beating
of two of them as well as against closing three press offices
in Gaza. </p>

<p>The journalists decided not to cover the PA official activities.
But they said they would continue covering the popular activities.</p>

<p>The Association held a meeting to discuss the latest developments
regarding the detention of the eight journalists. A statement
issued by the Association said it would proceed against the PA
at the Supreme Court of Justice to make it abide by the Palestinian
Press Law. The Association urged the journalists to boycott coverage
of police activities and to refrain from publishing photos of
its officers until they send an official apology to the Association.
It also called for the punishment of the policemen who beat the
journalists.</p>

<h3><center>House arrest on Sheikh Yasin lifted</center></h3>

<p><br>
<b>Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The Palestinian Authority lifted on
23 December the house arrest imposed on Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yasin, Palestinian..</p>

<p>Yasser Arafat's spokesman, al Tayeb Abdul Rahim, said the decision
to lift the house arrest was made by Arafat on the occasion of
the month of Ramadan.</p>

<p>However, observers note that the lifting of the house arrest
was a PA reaction to the Israeli decision to freeze the implementation
of the Wye agreement, despite PA and American protests to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Sheikh Yasin's home in Gaza was cordoned off following the
conclusion of the Wye agreement, his telephone line was severed,
and he was barred from receiving visitors or even perform prayers
at his neighborhood mosque.</p>

<p>The PA stringent measures against Yasin were seen as an attempt
on the part of the Palestinian leadership to show the Americans
that they are capable of suppressing any opposition to the Wye
agreement.</p>

<p>Three days ago, the PA released another high-ranking Islamist
leader, Sheikh Hamed al Beitawi of Nablus, who, too, had been
arrested after he criticized the Wye agreement as &quot;total
submission.&quot;</p>

<p>The PA is still holding up hundreds of Islamist supporters
without charge or trial. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed
Yasin, has called on PA president Yasser Arafat to release all
political prisoners &quot;who are being detained for no genuine
reasons except to satisfy Israel and the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking in Gaza shortly after PA police ended his house arrest,
which lasted for nearly two months, Yasin said &quot; they didn't
tell me why I was put under house arrest, and they didn't tell
me why they lifted the house arrest.&quot;</p>

<p>Hamas leaders urged Arafat again to release detained Islamist
leaders including Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, Ibrahim Makadmeh and
Jamal Mansur.</p>

<p>Palestinian sources say hundreds of Islamists are still incarcerated
by Yasser Arafat's self-rule authorities, mainly to appease Israel
and the United States.</p>

<p>The detention is illegal, even in accordance with the PA law.</p>

<h3><center>Former Israeli Jurist: &quot;We have grossly violated
Palestinian human rights&quot;</center></h3>

<p><br>
<b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Michael Ben Yaer, the Israeli government's
former legal advisor, admitted that Israel had systematically
and routinely violated Palestinian human rights since 1967. Writing
in the Israeli Hebrew daily, Haraetz, on 13 December, Ben Yaer
said that since 1967 &quot;we carried out actions against the
Palestinians that are seriously incompatible with the foundations
of a democratic and civilized society.&quot;</p>

<p>Ben Yaer pointed out that successive Israeli governments behaved
during the last thirty years as if the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip were an Israeli real estate although Israeli laws were not
made effective in the two territories.</p>

<p>He pointed out that the occupation authorities unhesitatingly
detained, rounded up, and incarcerated multiple thousands of Palestinians
without charge or trail, adding that &quot;a few administrative
arrests among Jews stirred a big outcry within the Israeli society.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We didn't witness a likewise sensitivity toward the wholesale
arrests of Palestinians, &quot; said Ben Yaer.</p>

<p>Ben Yaer referred to flagrant and scandalous Israeli practices
in the West Bank.</p>

<p>&quot;We didn't hesitate from banishing and expelling hundreds
of Palestinians from their homeland as we didn't hesitate to destroy
the homes of many without any sensitivity or consideration for
the suffering and torment inflicted on their families.&quot;</p>

<p>Yaer said the Jewish state has been adopting two judicial systems,
one comparatively liberal for Jews, and another &quot;very painful
and harsh&quot; for Palestinians.</p>

<p>The latter system, he said, was utterly incompatible with all
international conventions, which the Zionist state signed.<br>
Ben Yaer admitted that Israel didn't bother to distinguish between
innocent and culpable Palestinians, saying we treated all Palestinians
as guilty.</p>

<p>The former Israeli jurist expressed disbelief at the continued
employment by the Israeli government of the emergency laws and
regulations dating back to the British mandate era, which he described
as &quot;very flagrant and totally undemocratic.&quot;</p>

<p>Interestingly, Ben Yaer himself presided over the administration
of Israeli torment of the Palestinian people during his five-year-term
as &quot;Government Legal Advisor.&quot;</p>

<h3><center>Israeli Rabbi: Clinton should kiss Jews' feet!</center></h3>

<p><br>
<b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Israeli press reports quoted Rabbi
Ofadia Yousef, the founder of the extremist Jewish ultra-orthodox
party (Shas-10 seats in the Knesset), as saying that &quot;U.S.
President Bill Clinton will come here and he should kiss our feet
as mentioned in the Torah&quot;!</p>

<p>The reports pointed out that the extremist Rabbi's saying came
during his weekly religious sermon he delivered just a few hours
before Clinton's arrival to Occupied Jerusalem. The sermon was
transmitted by a private TV channel, which is usually attended
by tens of thousands of Jews.</p>

<h3><center>PA closes down TV and Radio stations </center></h3>

<p><br>
<b>Occupied Jerusalem -</b> In a classical contradiction between
declared position and actual deed, the Palestinian Authority has
called on Arabs and Muslims to condemn &quot;the colonial Anglo-American
campaign against brotherly Iraq.&quot;</p>

<p>In contradiction to that, however, PA chairman Yasser Arafat
instructed his police chiefs to suppress and if need be repress
anti-American demonstrations in the West Bank &quot;if they go
beyond the red line.&quot;</p>

<p>On Friday, PA police closed down five private television and
radio stations in the West Bank, allegedly for &quot;endangering
national Palestinian interests&quot; and &quot;undermining Palestinian
relations with a friendly country.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the media stations closed were &quot;al Watan&quot; or
homeland in Ramallah, al Rua'a TV station in Bethlehem, as well
as the &quot;al Nasre&quot; and &quot;al Hub wasalam&quot;.</p>

<p>Ibrahim al Husari, Marketing Director at al Watan, said he
was summoned via telephone to police headquarters in Ramallah
and told that &quot;the station has been ordered closed with any
explanation.&quot;</p>

<p>One Palestinian police officer said on condition of anonymity
that the closed media outlets &quot;over-covered the anti-American
demonstrations and incited the people to attack American interests.&quot;

<p>Mrs. Arafat said, &quot;I don't believe that there is a person

<h3><center>Betselem: Israel carries out &quot;systematic ethnic
cleansing&quot; in East Jerusalem</center></h3>

<p><br>
<b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> In a report published on Wednesday,
the Israeli Human Rights Organization, Betselem, concluded that
the Zionist regime is executing a policy of &quot;systematic expulsion
and ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem.&quot;</p>

<p>The report pointed out that in 1997, the Zionist authorities
confiscated 606 residency rights from the Palestinians, with 500
additional residency rights awaiting confiscation.</p>

<p>Moreover, the report pointed out that the Zionist authorities
refused to allow East Jerusalem Arabs to leave for Jordan or other
Arab countries until they agree in writing to forfeit their residency
rights.</p>

<p>The report described this policy as &quot;quiet and continuous
expulsion&quot; aimed at reducing Arab population to the very
minimal.</p>

<p>Finally, the report accused the municipal authorities, the
National insurance authorities and the Ministry of collaborating
among themselves to deprive Jerusalemites of their residency rights.
