<h3><center><font COLOR="#0000ff">A Ramadan present to Iraqi children</font></center></h3>

<p>The wanton Anglo-American bombing of Iraq on the eve of the
holy month of Ramadan, a few days before Christmas, should serve
as an eye-opener and food for thought for all Arabs and Muslims,
as well as men and women of good will, all over the world.</p>

<p>Here we have the United States, the only superpower in the
world, along with &quot;Great&quot; Britain, its obsequious junior
ally, moving in with their state-of-the-art weaponry of death
and destruction against a poor Third World country, already bombed-out
and seriously debilitated-to the point of starvation-by seven
years of punitive sanctions, raining death and havoc on Iraqi
towns, and leaving hundreds, perhaps thousands, of civilians killed
and mutilated in its wake.</p>

<p>And the reason? To punish Iraq and degrade Saddam Hussein's
ability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>However, it is amply clear that the issue is not Saddam Hussein,
nor the possibility of him attacking his neighbours.</p>

<p>Neither is the issue the weapons of mass destruction, which
have been subject to meticulous inspection by professional American,
British and Israeli spies.</p>

<p>Nor is it democracy in Iraq, for everybody knows well that
the new evil empire and its little surrogate, the United Kingdom,
never had democracy in the Middle East, and probably never will,
on the top of their political agenda.</p>

<p>In fact, it can be said without an iota of exaggeration that
it is precisely these two evil powers that sustain and protect
despotism in the region thinking that the existing anti-democratic
regimes are the main guarantee of Western, mainly American, economic
and strategic interests in the region.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the ultimate conclusion that the barbaric
bombing was aimed to kill, mutilate and humiliate the helpless
Iraqis.</p>

<p>The Anglo-American argument that the bombing was not aimed
at punishing the Iraqi people is a pile of rubbish. Decision makers
in Washington know quite well that it is the people, the ordinary
men, women and children, who are hurt, who are killed, either
by cruise missiles carrying the phrase &quot;This a Ramadan present
for the Iraqi people&quot;, or by the satanic sanctions that so
far have killed over a million Iraqi children.</p>

<p>Who killed those children? Saddam Hussein or the United States?</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the Iraqi people can't overthrow Saddam
Hussein.</p>

<p>For over 20 years, Saddam has consolidated his grip on power
in Iraq that only an external intervention could bring him down.<br>
But this is not the point, for there is little disagreement over
the nature of the Ba'athist regime in Baghdad.</p>

<p>Now, if the Iraqis cannot get rid of Saddam (this is a manifest
reality), why punish them and kill them en mass through sanctions
imposed and sustained and regularly prolonged by America and the
rest of the Western powers controlling the United Nations?<br>
</p>

<p><b>Why punish the victims?</b></p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that the Iraqi people are victimized
by the United States.</p>

<p>In fact, the United States is more responsible for the death
of over a million Iraqi children more than Saddam is, for the
people of Iraq are powerless to achieve U.S.-declared goals in
Iraq, namely getting rid of Saddam, even if they wanted to.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the all too macabre reality that the United
States is willfully, mindfully and consciously exterminating an
entire Arab Muslim people in full daylight under a host of false
pretenses, including non-compliance with UN resolutions and bearers
of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>This should enable us to safely say that the current U.S. administration,
mostly made up of Zionist Jews filled with enmity toward anything
Arab or Islamic, is no different from Nazi Germany, and its President,
the commander-in-chief of the criminal forces that bombed Iraq,
is no better than Adolph Hitler.</p>

<p>What else can one call an administration that is responsible
for the extermination of over a million children?</p>
