<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli Defense Force has warned the government that
retaking Palestinian-run cities is not a realistic option after army war-games
showed that it would cost hundreds of soldiers' lives, press reports said
yesterday.	The IDF carried out exercises last month to rehearse Operation
Thorn Field, a contingency plan under which Israeli troops would re-enter
some or all of the seven cities handed over to the Palestinian Authority
under the Oslo peace accords.	According to Yediot Aharnot newspaper, IDF
generals concluded: &quot;Israel has nothing to gain from a violent confrontation
with the Palestinians. They can only lose. Neither will the Palestinians
gain anything.&quot;<B><I> The Guardian,  July 21, 1997.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasser Arafat's Palestinian police yesterday revealed details
of what was claimed as &quot;the largest Hamas factory of explosive devices&quot;
ever uncovered, found in an apartment building close to the self-rule Arab
town of Bethlehem. The haul, whose size and deadly potential has underlined
the seriousness of the uneasy security situation, included nine huge explosive
devices ready for use and clothing and uniform intended to disguise the
would-be bombers as Jews. According to the Palestinian police, who have
been under pressure from Israel to crack down on Islamic militants vowing
a new campaign of revenge against posters depicting Prophet Muhammad as
a pig, the bomb factory contained Jewish prayer shawls and skull caps, wigs
and Israeli army uniforms. <B><I>The Times,  July 22, 1997.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a recently-published report, the United Nations estimated
that the unemployment rate (in Gaza and the West Bank) increased from 19
per cent to nearly 30 per cent, and per capita GNP in the Palestinian territories
dropped by more than 8 per cent. The average Palestinian wage fell by a
tenth over the same period, from $411 per month to $370, sufficient to cover
64 per cent of basic family needs. 	All the statistics reflect the fact
that the Oslo peace process has so far been economically damaging for the
Palestinians. By demarcating Palestinian territory, it has solidified the
inter-ethnic boundaries and partially unhitched the Palestinians from the
much stronger Israeli economy. Since 1993, their income as a group has shrunk
by about a third. <B><I>The Guardian,  July 23, 1997.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One quiet day last month in typically tumultuous Hebron,
74-year-old  Munir Muhammad Mahmud Karaja slowly hobbled off to buy some
vegetables  at the market. But the peace suddenly evaporated, and a shot
fired by Israeli soldiers,  coping with stone-throwing Arabs, struck the
elderly, silver-haired  Karaja in the head.	&quot;I have had five operations
since then,&quot; Karaja slowly explained.	&quot;My life has been turned
upside down. My eyes hurt. My head hurts. My  hands hurt. I was a writer
and I cannot do that anymore.&quot; Israeli and Palestinian human rights
activists offer Karaja as an  example of innocent Arab victims who would
suffer if a new law is passed  to limit the Israeli government's liability
to those accidentally  injured in the ongoing Arab-Israeli strife. <B><I>The

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Christians in the Holy Land seethed when an Israeli scientific
journal  recently illustrated an article on cloning by depicting the Madonna
and  Child with a cow's head superimposed on the face of the Virgin Mary.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized publicly for the  insult
to Christianity. The editors of the publication, Galileo,  expressed deep
regret to anyone who was offended, insisting they hadn't  known the Renaissance
picture of the Madonna had any religious  significance. <B><I>The Chicago
Tribune,  July 23, 1997.<BR>
