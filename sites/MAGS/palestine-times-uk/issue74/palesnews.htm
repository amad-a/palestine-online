<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel decides to Judaize education for Palestinian
Jerusalemites</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus - By Maha Abdel Hadi</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The Jewish State began accelerating its measures to
Judaize the occupied Arab Jerusalem, confiscate Palestinian lands, construct
bypass roads and separate it from other parts of the West Bank. The most
serious aspect of struggle over Jerusalem is the demographic one; the Israeli
government began its plan that aims to make the Arab residents of the Holy
City a minority surrounded by the Jewish settlements although they are the
real owners of the land. This was in line with the confiscation of land
and real estate, changing the Arab face of the Holy City, aggression on
its institutions and antiquities, and the confiscation of civil rights of
the Palestinian Jerusalemites in education, construction, housing and travel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The Israeli government has started an operation to
Judaize the Palestinian economic, health and educational institutions in
Jerusalem as well as the naturalization of a part of the Palestinian residents.
But the Judaization of  East Jerusalem is the most serious which is being
achieved through the disposition of the majority of its Palestinian residents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The Israeli Interior Minister Ele Suisa said that
&quot;anyone who wants to stay in Jerusalem should abide by the Israeli
laws and regulations.&quot; He added that the Jewish population of the Holy
City should be increased to 80%.  More than 110,000 Palestinian Jerusalemites
living outside the Holy City have been threatened to have their Jerusalem
residence permits confiscated for different reasons as defined by the Israeli
authorities. A decision made by the Israeli Supreme Court legalized the
measures taken by the interior ministry which allow the confiscation of
the residence permits of all Jerusalemites living outside East Jerusalem
even if it was for work or study.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     According to that decision, the interior ministry
began the confiscation of residence permits of many of the Palestinian residents,
suspended the reunion of Palestinian Jerusalemite families, and rejected
the registration of newborns for Jerusalemite mothers with the aim of evacuating
the Holy City of its original population. The most dangerous thing is that
the Israeli authorities treat the Jerusalemites who live in the suburbs
of East Jerusalem as if they live abroad. Moreover, the Israelis create
hard conditions that force the Palestinians to live over the Jerusalem municipal
borders especially by confiscating their land, preventing them from building,
demolishing their houses for different reasons, depriving them of basic
services, and rejecting the reunification of families. Since the last closure
in February 1996, the Israeli authorities have not allowed the residents
of the West Bank and Gaza who married Jerusalemites to reunite with their
wives or husbands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     According to an international organization, the Israeli
government obliges the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem to carry four
official documents: the identity card (residence permit), a magnetic card,
a work card issued by the health ministry (!) and a valid three-month travel
card issued by the military authority. In addition, any Palestinian that
wants to enter Jerusalem must leave his car outside the city, a form of
humiliation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The struggle against the confiscation of the residence
permit has become the main issue for the Palestinian Jerusalemites. These
permits were given to Jerusalemites after the June 1967 war which gives
them the status of  permanent residents which is less than the status of
full citizenship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Israeli sources revealed last year the interior ministry's
intention to divest between 50,000 and 70,000 Palestinians of their right
to citizenship and residency in Jerusalem. The plan aims to reduce the Palestinian
population in the Holy City from 160,000 to only 40,000. The ministry has
succeeded to divest about 12,000 Palestinians of their right of residency
in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Israeli sources said the main aim of the Israeli strategy
is to make the Jews a majority in Jerusalem. According to the official plans,
the Jewish population of Jerusalem is expected to reach 729,000 by the year
2005 and 817,000 by 2010.  Now the population of the Jews in East Jerusalem
is about 160,000, which is equal to the Palestinian population although
there was not a single Jew in the Holy City before June 1967.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Greater Jerusalem is now forming about 28% of the
total area of  the West Bank. The Israeli authorities confiscated 71% of
the land of East Jerusalem up until 1996. Israel has built 15 settlements
and 17 Jewish quarters in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat caves in to Israeli ultimatum</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Hebron- By Khalid Amayreh </FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After weeks of intermittent and often bloody disturbances
between stone-hurling Palestinian youngsters and heavily-armed Israeli soldiers,
 the  Palestinian Authority moved swiftly on 14 July to &quot;restore law
and order&quot; in downtown Hebron, thus caving in to a reported Israeli
ultimatum to that effect and forestalling the widely-rumoured planned Israeli
&quot;re-occupation&quot; of PA-administered Hebron, known as (H-1). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The PA deployed as many as 200 unarmed uniformed 
policemen and half as many Preventive Security agents along the &quot;buffer
zone&quot; separating H-1 and H-2. Palestinian police sources said the decision
to &quot;take action&quot; in Hebron was made based on Yasser Arafat's instructions.
According to  Hebron police chief Tarek Zeid, Palestinian and Israeli police
officers reached a late-night agreement on 13 July stipulating that Palestinian
police be solely responsible for maintaining law and order within the H-1
area, an obvious euphemistic reference to suppressing anti-Israeli protests.
In return, said Zeid, the Israeli army agreed to remove the concrete slabs
and other impediments which had been placed in the middle of Shallala Street
and paralyzed traffic between the Israeli-controlled Old Town and the rest
of Hebron. Furthermore, Zeid said the Israeli army agreed to terminate its
five-week-old siege on the Hebron district and release youngsters detained
in connection with the unrest.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The Palestinian decision to put an end to the protests
was apparently a clear subjugation to  a  &quot;stern warning &quot; by
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu who threatened a &quot;severe
Israeli response if the riots continued.&quot; Neither Israeli nor Palestinian
officials spelled out what Netanyahu had in mind, but the press spoke explicitly
of &quot;a planned retaking of Hebron by the IDF and the ousting of the
PA from the town.&quot; Indeed, PA police and political officials cited
this &quot;eventuality&quot; as the &quot;compelling reasons&quot; necessitating
the decision to end the riots. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     At least two Palestinian boys were killed and as many
as 500 Palestinian youngsters injured, some seriously, by Israeli rubber
bullets and gunshots during 10 weeks of what was dubbed as &quot;confrontations&quot;
between stone-throwing youngsters and heavily-armed Israeli soldiers. The
abrupt intervention by PA police to suppress anti-Israeli protests in Hebron
drew mixed reactions in this embattled city. Many in the town scolded  the
PA for &quot;betraying the blood of our youngsters.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;Look, they (the PA) first encouraged the boys
to throw stones at the Israelis and now they return to business-as-usual
with them,&quot; said an embittered shopkeeper at the Bab el Zawwiya commercial
district.  &quot;I won't resist the Israelis any longer because every time
we carry out acts of resistance, we are undercut by the PA,&quot; said an
indignant youngster who couldn't understand how the PA could treat Palestinian
lives so lightly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Other townspeople, however, welcomed the return of
a semblance of normal life to a town that had suffered so badly as a result
of the enduring unrest and tension.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;We have been placed for too long between the
anvil and the hammer; we need a respite,&quot; said Hamed al Karaki, a Palestinian
shopkeeper who was forced to close his store by Israeli soldiers following
the explosion of a home-made device outside his shop on 9 July.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The relative calm in Hebron is unlikely to last for
a long time to come. At best, it will be just a respite.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas and the PA</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Just as Hamas-PA relations were moving towards a semblance
of stability and maturity whereby &quot;tension-management&quot; gained
pre-eminence over confrontation, PA police discovered what was described
as a &quot;bomb factory&quot; inside a Beit Sahur apartment on 21 July.
According to PA Bethlehem police chief, Kamal al Sheikh, the bomb factory,
which most likely belonged to Hamas, contained more than 30 kilograms of
ready-made TNT explosives, timers and other accessories used in making bombs.
On 14 July, a man believed to be a member of Hamas died in Beit Sahur while
assembling a bomb.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The raid on the Beit Sahur flat provided the PA with
a badly-needed opportunity to take the steam out of the incessant Israeli
charges that PA police were not only refraining from fighting terrorism
but in fact getting involved in acts of terrorism against Israeli targets.
 It also carried a certain message to Hamas that the PA would not allow
Hamas to cross over the &quot;red lines&quot;, particularly those pertaining
to preparing or actually carrying out attacks against Israel. But this logic
has only ostensible validity since Fateh elements, too, may have been involved
in armed attacks against Israeli targets, which really makes the PA-Hamas
divide less stark than it seems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Hamas denied any connection with the discovered bomb
factory.  A spokesman for the Movement accused the PA of &quot;concocting
the whole thing in order to impress the Israelis and the Americans.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;This sly act is characteristic of the PA,&quot;
said the spokesman, who opted to conceal his identity.  </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>People without land Like a body without a
spirit</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Like the question of refugees, settlements and  East Jerusalem,
the ban on selling Arab land to Israelis goes to the core of the Palestine
conflict -- land.  At the time of the new land sale ban being initiated
by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel had already confiscated over 60%
of the West Bank and 40% of Gaza.  Clearly, the behaviour of a hostile Israeli
government has forced the PA to take drastic steps to stave off further
loss of Palestinian land. The view shared by the vast majority of Palestinians,
who saw too many of their children die and sacrifice for their struggling
nation, is that selling land to Israelis is the highest form of treason
and should receive the highest form of punishment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The ban on selling Palestinian land to Israelis began
on 5 May when PA Justice Minister Freih Abu Median said that Arabs who sold
land  to Israelis should be punished with the most severe terms, including
death.  This is not an evolution in Palestinian political thought. Since
the first uprising in 1936, fraudulent Arab land dealers have been targeted
as traitors. 	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The usual chorus of hypocritical U.S. and Israeli denunciation
came after the killing of land dealer Farid Bashiti, whose bound and beaten
body was found in Ramallah less than a week following Abu Median's statement.
 Bashiti was reportedly last seen in the custody of Force 17, an elite security
arm of the PA.  According to the Israeli police, Nadia Dabash, 33, lured
Bashiti to the Ambassador Hotel in East Jerusalem where he was apprehended
and taken to PA-controlled Ramallah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Not only was PA security personnel working independently
in &quot;unified Jerusalem&quot;, embarrassing to Netanyahu, but their actions
go against the Palestinian promise not to punish collaborators. The Israeli
insistence to protect traitors living in Palestinian areas has seemingly
left the PA with only extra-judicial measures to deal with fraudulent land
dealers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The chief Muslim cleric of Jerusalem, Mufti Ikrema Sabri,
called Bashiti an &quot;infidel&quot; for selling Arab land to Jews and
declared that he could not be buried in a Muslim cemetery.  The cleric later
told a Friday crowd that these people should be removed from Palestinian
society. &quot;You should not speak to them, allow them to marry into your
family or mix with them in any way.&quot;  He also said anyone who sympathizes
with the land  dealers should be ostracized, including their families. This
is the view  shared by nearly every Palestinian, Christian or Moslem, leftist
or rightist. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;A people without land is like a body without a spirit,&quot;
said an emotional young man following Friday prayers outside Al Aqsa.  &quot;These
dealers are killing our country so we have to defend ourselves.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The body of Harbi Abu Sara, 60, from Ein Yabroud village
was  found near Ramallah with a bullet in the head two weeks later.  &quot;In
his village he is known as a dealer of land,&quot; said Mustafa Liftawi,
the mayor of Ramallah. &quot;He sold land to Israelis and he had a bad reputation
ethically.&quot;  Liftawi denied PA involvement in the death, saying it
was a family dispute, but the Israelis were not buying it. &quot;There is
no doubt that it was people from the PA who stood behind the person who
pulled the trigger -- even people in official positions,&quot; said Israeli
Police Minister Avigdor Kahalani.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A few days later another suspected land dealer, Ali Jambour,
34, from Shoufat refugee camp was found shot dead in Ramallah after reportedly
 being taken by PA security forces.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	While it appears that the PA security forces are enforcing
Abu  Median's hard-line ban on land sales, Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat  denied official responsibility for the killings. Palestinians who
sold land to Israelis were &quot;isolated traitors and we will act against
them according to the law. It is our right and obligation to protect our
land.&quot; Arafat explained that this was not a new or even Palestinian
law.  It was first imposed by the Jordanian government after losing the
West Bank in 1967, he said.  He also claimed the ban had dealt a blow to
Israel's settlement policy, which was boosted recently by the impotent American
(un)response to the breaking of ground at the Jebal Abu Ghneim settlement
in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Embarrassed yet opportunistic, Netanyahu contemplated
&quot;breaking  off&quot; contacts with the PA. &quot;We must consider carefully
if we should  continue talks with people who represent such fascist theories,&quot;
said his  advisor David Bar-Illan. Other right-wing ministers called the
ban &quot;anti- semitic.&quot;	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Bar-Illan's claiming the PA's land policy as &quot;fascist&quot;
is the most  hypocritical comment out of the Likud since Ariel Sharon called
Arafat a  &quot;terrorist.&quot; The fact is, since 1948 Israel has banned
the sale of Jewish  National Fund (JNF) land to Arabs, even if they are
citizens. &quot;The  Palestinians are mimicking us,&quot; says Israeli lawyer
Danny Seideimann.   &quot;An Israeli (Arab) citizen born and bred in Haifa
who wants to buy an  apartment on JNF land is not entitled to, while a Jewish
resident in the U.S. is.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Losing international support over the Jebal Abu Ghneim
debacle,  Israeli and American officials have been waiting for an opportunity
to put  pressure back on the PA. It is no coincidence that Abu Median's
 statements came after U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross wasted two weeks 
trying to force Arafat into accepting the fait accompli of Jebal Abu  Ghneim
and return to &quot;negotiations&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 	&quot;The U.S. condemns any law or decree that would
threaten death  against any Palestinian for selling land to Israelis or
Jews,&quot; said State  Department spokesman Nicholas Burns. &quot;That's
wrong. It is contrary to  what must prevail in the Middle East, which is
peace and the spirit of  peace.&quot; As the main power and so-called peace
broker in the Middle East,  one would expect that the U.S. would at least
try to present a balanced  position on the issue of land rights in the West
Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Not quite as incredulous as Bar-Illan, Burns articulates
a position that is so far from being balanced that even the most docile
Arab leaders face increasing pressure at home for supporting the so-called
peace process. &quot;This is now the most crucial stage of Oslo,&quot; says
Ahmed Abu Hassan in Gaza. &quot;If the effort to attain our homeland through
negotiation fails, then we have no other option but to return to the armed
struggle.  We at least know what the rules are of that game.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Any Palestinian teenager could tell both Burns and Ross
that the  ban on selling land and the killing of land dealers would not
have happened had the U.S. stood up to Netanyahu's blatant violation of
Oslo and international law at Jebal Abu Ghneim.  Clinton's failure to put
a stop to the further expropriation of Palestine forced the PA to deal with
this matter in their own way.   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At the time of this writing, dozens of suspected land
dealers are in PA jails.  Haaretz newspaper reports that a &quot;hit list&quot;
of 16 fraudulent Arab land dealers is being circulated through the PA security
establishment.  Far from backing down, Abu Median has since threatened Israeli
Arab land dealers. &quot;We advise those who carry the Israeli identity
card that if they believe they have become Israeli citizens, and because
of that they are protected, they are mistaken,&quot; he said.  &quot;They
will be brought to justice one way or another.&quot;  A few days later Israeli
forces were able to protect known land dealer Assad Rajabi from being taken
from Jerusalem to Ramallah by the PA.  Netanyahu blamed Colonel Tawfiq Tirawi
as the PA official behind at least two of the killings and the effort to
take Rajabi into custody.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Despite the feeble efforts by Dennis Ross, the crisis
is deepening  and it seems that the only way to avoid even a bloodier confrontation
is a  U.S.-imposed Middle East land conference to determine who rightly
owns  what in the West Bank under the framework of the Fourth Geneva  Convention.
If Israel is so sure of the legality in which it has come to &quot;own&quot;
60% of the West Bank, then let them open the Land Registration Office for
international documentation. Unlike the other offices of the West Bank &quot;Civil
Administration,&quot; which are located at Beit El near the Jalazone refugee
camp, the Land Registration Office is at a secret location inside of Israel
and its records are &quot;top secret.&quot;  This is for an obvious reason
-- the fraudulent nature of most of the land transactions that have taken
place in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Nearly four years ago, optimists at the White House envisioned
that in 1997 the final-status peace talks would begin. Palestinians feel
that it is instead the beginning of the &quot;final-solution&quot; for their
dream of statehood in historic Palestine. Until it is clear what type of
 entity will emerge in the West Bank and who will control how much land,
 those who sell sacred and limited West Bank land to encroaching Israelis
 will be the first victims in what is sure to be a bloody confrontation.

bombing </FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>Occupied Jerusalem - Special for PT</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In what is largely viewed as a retaliatory response to
the defamation by Jewish settlers of the Prophet Muhammed on 28 June, two
Palestinian youths blew themselves up in a crowded West Jerusalem market
on 30 July, killing 14 Israelis and injuring as many as 170 others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The incident occurred around 1:15 local time (10:15 GMT)
at the Mehane Yehuda marketplace in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli police chief Assaf Hefetz said two suicidal bombers
apparently simultaneously detonated two large bombs they were carrying,
resulting in the high toll of casualties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The bodies of the two suspected Palestinians were found
in the rubble, but as of now they have not been identified.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli hospital sources said as many as 20 people sustained
serious injuries while at least five others were in &quot;very critical
conditions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, far no Palestinian organization has claimed responsibility
for the incident. However, Israeli sources suspect that radical Islamic
elements may have carried out the bloody attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli intelligence sources described the bombing as a
&quot;big disaster.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Knesset member and former Shabak head, Gedeon Ezra, said
in a radio interview after the bombing that Israel would need a long time
to &quot;absorb&quot; the bombing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He called on the Palestinian Authority to enter immediately
into a full and comprehensive intelligence and security cooperation with
Israel for the purpose of &quot;eliminating the terrorists.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the incident, the Israeli army imposed  a strict
closure on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, preventing Palestinians from
entering Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Palestinian workers in Israel were ordered to
return to their places of residence immediately.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian and Israeli sources said more collective punishment
measures were expected, including massive arrests among people with Islamist
orientations and home demolition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>REACTIONS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat telephoned Israeli
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to express his condemnation of the incident
and condolences over the loss of life in the bombings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's media advisor, David Bar Illan, described as
&quot;very difficult&quot; the telephone conversation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bar Illan said Netanyahu scolded Arafat, telling him &quot;to
stop talking and start doing something to fight terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat reportedly assured Netanyahu and latter Israeli
president Ezer Weisman that he would do every thing he could to fight &quot;terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian observers, however, don't believe that the
bombing was aimed specifically at sabotaging the peace process which was
in a precarious state long before the incident that a bombing could only
contribute to its revival rather than its collapse. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The bombings, while can not be isolated from the overall
context of the Israeli of narrowing Palestinian horizons, are likely to
have been precipitated by the pasting last month of anti-Islamic posters
in Hebron which caricatured the Prophet Muhammed as a pig writing the Quran.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>MPs: PA acts as an Israeli  puppet</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Several Palestinian Legislative Council members have castigated
the Palestinian Authority leadership for &quot;acting as an Israeli puppet.&quot;
 The councillors' anger stemmed from PA  Chairman Yasser Arafat's decision
to order the arrest and trial of several PA police officers accused by Israel
of &quot;implication in planning anti-Israeli activities.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Abdul Fattah Hamayel, a councillor from Tulkarm, 
voiced bitterness at the PA for being &quot;so responsive to Israeli charges
and pressure.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;When the PA acts on Israeli charges by arresting
and trying Palestinian police officers, it conveys a very bad message which
says the Palestinian Authority is just an Israeli puppet,&quot; said Hamayel
during a Legislative Council session in Ramallah on 22 July.  A similar
feeling was expressed by Nablus councillor Muawiyya al Masri who accused
the PA of showing &quot;appalling submissiveness to Israeli blackmail.&quot;
 Al Masri questioned bitterly how  the Israeli occupation authorities could
stop the car of Colonel Munir Abbushi, arrest, handcuff and blindfold him
before being taken away to an Israeli detention camp amid official Palestinian
Authority silence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;What the Palestinian Authority has been doing
in this regard shows that it is but a tool in the hands of the Israelis,
nothing but,&quot; said al Masri.  Hamayel, al Masri and another councillor,
Qaddura Faris of Ramallah, unanimously agreed that Israeli occupation authorities
were pressing charges pertaining to Palestinian police involvement in anti-Israeli
activities solely to extract more political concessions from an increasingly
vulnerable and weak Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Last month, Arafat ordered the formation of an inquiry
commission  to look into Israeli charges that high-ranking Palestinian police
officers were recently involved in planning and carrying out hostile acts
against Jewish settlers in the northern West Bank.  Among PA officers detained
by the autonomous authorities is Colonel Jihad al Massimi whom Israel had
accused of masterminding a planned attack on Jewish settlers near Nablus.
 Several other lower-ranking officers were reportedly detained or dismissed
from duty.</FONT></P>

reputation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority police continued to detain a Gazan
professor for the second consecutive week for undermining the national reputation
and distorting the PA image.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Fathi Ahmed Subuh, a professor of education at Al
Azhar University in Gaza reportedly went on a hunger strike last month to
protest his continued detention at a former Israeli prison in Gaza. Subuh,
44 years old and father of five children, was arrested by  Preventive Security
agents on charges pertaining to submitting questions on a final exam which
reportedly were critical of the PA administration.  Subuh's wife, Fatima,
told the Palestine Times that her husband had not had any problems with
the PA and that he was arrested 23 times during the Israeli occupation for
being a member in Fatah, the PLO mainstream faction, and for involvement
in anti-Israeli activities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;My husband should be released immediately because
he is innocent and did nothing wrong,&quot; said Fatima Subuh. According
to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, the charges against Subuh
are unclear and aimed at silencing political dissent.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;They (the Palestinian Authority) want to make
sure that people have eyes that see not, ears that hear not and mouths that
speak not, for this is the perfect environment in which a corrupt and despotic
regime can survive and thrive,&quot; said a spokesman for the PHRMG who
opted not to mention his name.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Amnesty International has declared Subuh a prisoner
of conscience and urged human rights organizations to send telegrams and
letters of protest to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The detention of Dr. Subuh has been completely ignored
by the PA-controlled media.  </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Report: Israel uses Palestinian prisoners
as &quot;guinea pigs&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has systematically carried
out &quot;scientific experiments&quot; on Palestinian detainees in Israel,
Palestinian and Israeli sources said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     A report published Thursday, 17 July in major Arabic
newspapers in  the occupied territories revealed that &quot;as many as 1,000
drug-related experiments are carried out every year on Arab prisoners in
Israeli prisons and detention camps.&quot;  According to the report, which
quoted reliable Israeli sources including Knesset members, the Israeli Health
Ministry granted major drug-manufacturing companies in Israel more than
1,000 permits to use Palestinian prisoners as &quot;lab animals&quot; to
test the effect of new drugs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The scandalous practice was initially disclosed by
Labour Knesset member Dalya Itsek who reportedly demanded that an independent
investigation to that effect be carried out. Itsek revealed that &quot;at
least 1,000 experiments involving dangerous drugs are carried out each year
on Palestinian prisoners without their knowledge.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The disclosure has not been completely denied by Israeli
Health Ministry officials. Ami Livnat, Head of the Drug Department at the
Ministry of Health, reportedly admitted that &quot;there has been a 15%
increase in the number of experiments on inmates.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The shocking revelation drew sharp reactions from
human rights groups, the detainees themselves and their families.  Saleh
al Haj Yahya of the organization Physicians for Human Rights, described
the revelation as &quot;appalling.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;If the report is proven true, then I won't find
the words to describe our reactions towards it,&quot; said Yahya.  Yahya
himself revealed that news of the scandal was initially leaked by a Likud
activist whom he names as &quot;Moti Areil.&quot; However, Yahya wondered
why a &quot;Likud stalwart would uncover a scandal as such.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli officials: no comment</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Israeli officials, including health officials, apparently
sought to move swiftly to limit the damage and &quot;not to make a big issue
out of it.&quot; Yahya told the Gaza-based weekly, al Risala, that he had
tried in vain to contact Israeli health officials on the matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;I even tried to contact Dalya Itsek of the Labour
Party who spoke about the subject in the Knesset, but to no avail,&quot;
said Yahya.  Raji al Surani, head of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights,
also sought to contact Israeli officials on the matter but without success.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;Nobody can ignore a subject as such...It is
a stigma of indescribable proportions,&quot; said Surani.  </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Evidence </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Human rights organizations in the occupied territories
were not surprised.  Representatives of these organizations readily point
out that many of the released Palestinian prisoners suffer from chronic
symptoms that did not exist prior to their detention.  Indeed, the death
of at least 45 Palestinians either in detention or soon after their release
 constitutes prima facie evidence incriminating the Israelis.  These deaths
have not been investigated as they are routinely dismissed by the Israeli
Prison Authority as those arising &quot;of natural causes.&quot; </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas vows to respond to blasphemous posters</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has vowed to respond
to last week's anti-Islamic posters in Hebron which depicted the Prophet
Muhammed as a pig writing the Qur'an.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     A leaflet circulated by the Islamic Movement throughout
the West Bank on 6 July attacked Jewish settlers for embarking on &quot;an
abominable act as such,&quot; warning that the &quot;nefarious sin won't
pass with impunity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;Holding the Holy Qur'an and our Prophet (may
God's peace and blessing be upon him) up to mockery is a grand crime that
won't pass with impunity,&quot; said the two-page leaflet. The leaflet described
the blasphemous posters as &quot;a diabolical feat,&quot; adding that it
was but &quot;a natural extension of the racist practices perpetrated by
Zionist occupiers and successive Israeli governments.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Moreover, the leaflet called on the Muslim Umma (nation)
to make genuine efforts to challenge Zionist insolence and arrogance.  &quot;All
doors must be opened for Muslims to defend their faith and religious shrines...and
let the shackles of Oslo go to hell.&quot;  Hamas pointed out in its leaflet
that the Zionist crime was merely a reflection of the underlying thinking
throughout the Jewish settler population and a significant segment of the
Israeli Jewish society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The Movement also urged Arab and Muslim nations to
&quot;immediately stop and sever any normalization with the enemies of our
Prophet...for this is the least we can do to protest Jewish profanity against
Islam.&quot;  On 4 and 5 July, Hamas and the Islamic Movement in Israel
proper held two large demonstrations in Nablus and Nazareth respectively
during which speakers demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu
apologize to the entire Muslim world because degrading the Prophet was not
an exclusive Palestinian or Arab affair. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Israeli officials did apologize to the Palestinians
soon after the posters were publicized by the media. However, the Israeli
government refused, as always, to take any action against Jewish settlers
amongst whom anti-Islamic (and anti-gentile) racism is abundantly rife.
In fact, children of Jewish settlers in Hebron shouted anti-Islamic slogans
in Hebron on  5 July, demonstrating their (and presumably their parents')
admiration and support for the perpetrators of the anti-Islam crime.</FONT></P>

</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As many as 20 thousand Palestinians swore allegiance to
the Prophet Muhammed (PBOH) in Hebron on 19 July amid renewed tension between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority over alleged involvement of Palestinian
police officers in acts of resistance against Israeli occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The large rally, bearing the title  &quot;loyalty to the
Prophet&quot; was organized by the Islamic movement in the town in response
to blasphemous anti-Islamic posters pasted by a Jewish female settler on
Arab storefronts in Hebron three weeks ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several Islamist speakers addressed the huge multitude,
reasserting the traditional Islamic stance against the Israeli occupation
and the political process and calling on Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
and Arab-Muslim states to terminate their subservience to American hegemony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Nayef Rajub, a charismatic speaker from the town
of Dura 12 miles south west of Hebron, described the Jewish attack on the
Prophet Muhammed and the Quran as &quot;absolutely compatible with inherent
Jewish disrespect of other peoples' religions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Their latest profanity is no surprise to anybody
who reads the Talmud,&quot; said Rajub.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The imam of the Grand Mosque in Dura said there was inherent
Jewish enmity toward the person of  Prophet Muhammed since &quot;he put
an end to their settlements in the Arabian Peninsula and exposed them naked
before the whole world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Rajub also blamed Muslim leaders, without naming any of
them, for &quot;having the audacity to insult the prophet of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We bitterly notice today that throughout the Muslim
world the only people who can stand up to Jewish insolence and arrogance
are behind bars.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Azzam Salhab, who was introduced as &quot;official representative
of the Islamic Movement,&quot; urged the PA to release all political prisoners
and &quot;not to close the door in the face of those who desire to fight
those who usurped our homeland, arrogated our rights, and destroyed our
homes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salhab, a professor of Islamic Studies at the Hebron University,
also called on the PA  &quot;to respect political pluralism,  freedom of
speech and the press, and to put an end it nepotistic appointments in the
public sectors.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Salhab castigated the PA policy of  appointing
&quot;municipal committees&quot; to run local councils throughout the occupied
territories, describing it as amounting to &quot;raping citizens' rights
and confiscating our people's freedoms.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamist organizers of the rally pasted huge posters
and posted signs warning Jews against &quot;perpetrating this crime against&quot;
and vowing &quot;to burn the hands of those who insult the greatest man
in the past, present and future.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;I do not feel sorry for what I did and my wish
is to meet God as a martyr.&quot;  This is what the Hamas military leader
Hassan Salameh (26) said after hearing the sentence passed against him by
an Israeli military court. A mere smile was Salameh's reaction when the
Israeli judge was reading the sentence: 46 life imprisonment sentences which
equal 12 centuries of rigorous imprisonment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>      The Israeli newspaper, Ma'ariv, described Salameh
in the court: he stood in the dock as if he came to attend a comedy. He
gave no attention to his Israeli judges or to the relatives of his victims.
When the judge asked him about the reasons that drove him to commit what
he did, Salameh replied, &quot;Jihad is a part of my religion and faith...and
you occupy and usurp my land and my people's rights...also your crime of
assassinating Martyr Yahya Ayyash, &quot;The Engineer&quot;, forced us to
seek revenge for his blood.&quot;  When asked by the court about what he
wanted from the court, Mr. Salameh answered : &quot;I want you to sentence
me to death in order to follow my brothers, the martyrs of Al Qassam Brigades.&quot;
But the judge refused saying, &quot;I do not want to meet this criminal's
desire.&quot; Instead, Salameh received a life imprisonment sentence for
each Israeli he was accused of killing which was not denied by Salameh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Hassan Salameh is a Hamas military leader who planned
for a number of attacks against the Israeli occupation soldiers and settlers
including three suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and Occupied Jerusalem in February
and March 1996, following the January 1996 assassination by the Israeli
Mossad of the Engineer Yahya Ayyash, killing 46 Israelis and injuring more
than 200.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem - A report prepared by the Jerusalem
Institute for Israeli Studies pointed out that the Jewish extremist groups
increased their attempts to change the present status of the Holy Shrine
(Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock). The Israeli report added that
these attempts included simple requests by a number of Jewish official and
semi-official establishments to partition Al Aqsa Mosque and allow the Jews
to perform their prayers inside it. It stressed that these requests are
supported by increasing numbers of Israelis who want to diminish the control
of the Islamic Waqf Authority on the Jerusalem Holy Shrine by allowing Jewish
establishments to  be a partner in its administration. The report published
the results of a public opinion poll which showed that 93% of the Jewish
Israelis consider the Holy Shrine (known among the Zionists as the &quot;Temple
Mount&quot;) an important place for them. Some 87% of the respondents wished
they could perform their prayers freely there and 70% called for the cessation
of the Islamic control over Al Aqsa. The report concluded that the demands
of the Jewish extremist groups to allow them to perform their prayers inside
Al Aqsa would be enhanced in the final status negotiations with the PLO
due to start next year.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ramallah</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - A Palestinian human
rights organization expressed deep concern over the appointment of a former
chief of the Israeli Internal Security Service (Shin Bet) as an advisor
in Prime Minister Netanyahu's office because of his role in killing Palestinian
prisoners. Al Haqq (Right) for Defence of Palestinian Human Rights said
General Ehud Yatom (49) was accused of exterminating two Palestinians arrested
in 1984 after hijacking an Israeli bus in the Gaza Strip. &quot;The appointment
of General Yatom is an </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>official reward for a man who should be tried for committing
an intentional double murder with his own hands. This would encourage other
Israelis to perpetrate similar crimes,&quot; a statement by Al Haqq said.
Subhi and Majdi Abu Jamea were killed on 13 April 1984 after hijacking an
Israeli bus with the aim of swapping the Israeli hostages with Palestinian
prisoners in the Israeli jails. They were arrested alive but later killed
by the Shin Bet officers on their way to detention. General Yatom had admitted
last year to an Israeli newspaper that he killed the two Palestinians according
to an order from the Shin Bet chief at the time, General Abraham Shalom.
Yatom, who was later appointed as chief of the Shin Bet, was appointed as
advisor to the Israeli Prime Minister for protection and guardianship affairs.
He is a brother of  the present chief of the Israeli Mossad, Dani Yatom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem - A study conducted by the Palestinian
Applied Research Institute revealed an Israeli plan organized to suffocate
the Palestinian residential quarters in East Jerusalem and separate them
from the other Palestinian occupied territories.  The study pointed out
that the Occupation authorities confiscated 1,140 dunams (1 dunam= 1,000
square metres) in order to expand Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem last
year.  They have confiscated an additional 18,300 dunams to construct roads
for settlements in these areas.  The study added that the Israeli government
continued to confiscate Palestinian land in the Holy City in order to create
new facts. The Israeli authorities aim to increase the number of Jewish
settlers there in order to outnumber the Arab residents in East Jerusalem
before the final status talks which were scheduled to start officially in
May 1996. In addition, the Israeli municipality of the Holy City took a
number of measures against the Palestinian residents such as the rejection
of applications for building licences, and the confiscation of their land
and  their residence permits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus - The family of Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a spokesman
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the West Bank, said the health
of Sheikh Yousef is deteriorating while still in an Israeli jail. They added
that the Israelis transferred Sheikh Yousef from Ashkelon to Talmund jail
which is known for its bad conditions since the Palestinian prisoners are
detained in underground cells. Sheikh Yousef was arrested last March on
his way to perform pilgrimage. He had been suffering from rheumatism after
having served a lengthy detention at Mascoubiya jail where he was savagely
tortured.  The family complained that they were prevented from visiting
him without any reason. Meanwhile, a responsible source of Hamas held the
Occupation authorities responsible for the continuation of the detention
of Sheikh Yousef and thousands of Palestinians which violates all international
human rights conventions and laws. Hamas considered the detainees as prisoners
of war whom the Occupation authorities turned into hostages in order to
make deals. Hamas stressed that the releasing of the Palestinian prisoners
from the Israeli jails will remain on the top of its priorities.<BR>
