    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr Ben-Ami (Israel&#146;s foreign minister) earlier told American Jewish
    leaders that his government was prepared to surrender control of Temple Mount (Al Aqsa
    Holy Mosque) and other sites at the heart of the Middle East conflict as part of a peace
    agreement. He pointed out that &quot;as a practical matter&quot; the Palestinians are
    &quot;in almost full control of the upper surface of the Mount&quot;.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was a visit to Temple Mount (Al Aqsa Holy Mosque) at the end of
    September by the Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, that sparked the latest wave of
    violence, in which more than 340 people have been killed. The last round of peace talks at
    Camp David in July collapsed because Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were unable to
    find a formula reconciling both sides' religious claims.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">There are no Christmas decorations in Bethlehem's Manger Square, where
    tens of thousands of Christians from around the world ushered in the millennium last year.
    Local hotels are devoid of tourists. Their only guests are Palestinian residents of Beit
    Jala and Beit Sahur whose homes have been hit by Israeli attacks or who have decided to
    try and flee from the violence.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority has banned Christmas decorations and private
    individuals agree that the mood is too somber to make decorations appropriate. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Pictures of Palestinians killed by Israeli troops are glued on some shop
    walls in the town. An 11-week Israeli closure on Palestinian areas, including a tight
    blockade on Bethlehem, has made it difficult for pilgrims and tourists to visit holy sites
    in the town. They must transfer from bus to bus to visit the town and many have been
    warned that it is too dangerous to visit. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Los Angeles Times, 23 December 2000</font> </b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">BETHLEHEM, West Bank--The story of this Christmas, Palestinians say, lies
    not in the decorated tree tucked into a corner of Manger Square's Peace Center, nor in the
    creches from churches around the world displayed there. It is in the Palestinian
    children's drawings that are hanging in the center's main auditorium. </p>
    <font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Dozens
    of crayon sketches show villages being strafed by helicopter gunships, soldiers pointing
    guns at stone-throwing children, tanks rolling through the streets, and armed and masked
    Palestinian fighters. This is what youths ages 6 to 18 came up with when asked to
    illustrate their concept of human rights, in a project funded by UNICEF. </p>
    <font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&quot;These
    pictures say a lot about the reality these children live,&quot; said Dr. Elia Awad, head
    of the Palestine Red Crescent Society's mental health department. &quot;All of them are
    talking about their survival rights. They are scared to death.&quot; </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">AN attempt to salvage a Middle East peace deal in the dying days of the
    Clinton presidency appeared seriously undermined last night as the incoming administration
    said recent American diplomacy had hindered a settlement.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli and Palestinian delegations are expected to go to Washington this
    week to try to find common ground that could pave the way for a peace summit. Both sides
    are due to hold separate talks with American officials in the first serious attempt to
    resume negotations, which have been in abeyance since the Palestinian uprising erupted in
    the West Bank and Gaza Strip at the end of September.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The already slim chances of success were reduced further yesterday when
    Vice-President-elect Dick Cheney voiced the incoming administration's &quot;concerns that
    the way the Clinton administration operated in the [last] year or so in the Middle East
    has made it more difficult to reach a settlement&quot;. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Financial Times, 11 December 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel's prime minister Ehud Barak resigned yesterday, saying he would
    seek a new mandate in a special premiership election and promising further efforts to make
    peace with the Palestinians. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The sudden decision was intended to pre-empt the possible return to the
    political arena of Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister whom Mr Barak defeated in
    May 1999. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..Mr Netanyahu resigned from the Knesset (parliament) and leadership of
    the main opposition Likud party after losing the 1999 election. As only sitting Knesset
    deputies can run for the premiership, Mr Netanyahu could not be a candidate. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">However, he could become one if the Knesset voted to dissolve itself and
    he sought election as a deputy in fresh legislative elections. This is what Mr Barak is
    trying to prevent. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Likud officials warned that Mr Barak's gamble could backfire given Mr
    Netanyahu's increasing popularity in opinion polls, which show he would easily trounce Mr
    Barak. The polls also show Likud could become the largest party in the next Knesset. </p>
