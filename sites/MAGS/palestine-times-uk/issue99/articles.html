war on Palestinian children </font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</font><font size="3"><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, an Israeli court in West Jerusalem acquitted an Israeli
settler of murdering a 10-year-old Palestinian child, citing insufficient evidence and
&quot;extenuating circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The murderer, a Jewish settler named Nahum Korman, killed Helmi
al-Shousheh of the Arab village of Husan, four miles south-west of Bethlehem, while
chasing a group of schoolchildren whom he claimed hurled stones at his car.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The incident, which took place in October 1996, was described by the
Palestinian and Israeli press alike as &quot;a cold-blooded murder for which no
justification can be found.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shousheh's friends testified then that they saw Kolman step on the child's
throat with his army boots, beat him on the back of his head with the butt of his gun
until the child lost consciousness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shousheh was transferred to hospital with a massive brain haemorrhage
where he succumbed to his injury.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, Kolman cited &quot;self-defense&quot; as justification for the
gruesome crime. However, he later retracted his testimony, claiming that Shousheh's head
injury resulted from a fall, not from (his) gun strikes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The judge, Ruth Orr, who is reportedly affiliated with the Israeli
far-right, wasted no time in embracing Kolman's concocted story.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She dismissed the testimonies of Shousheh's school peers, Ibrahim and
Taher Shawash, as children&#146;s &quot;fantasies&quot; saying, &quot;There is no
plausible reason to believe that the children told the truth.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Orr also rejected a testimony by the Israeli Chief Coroner, Yehuda Hiss,
who testified that after watching a recreation of the witnesses' version of events, he was
convinced that the child's death had been caused by the gun blows and the stomping.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a nutshell, one more Jewish murderer of a Palestinian gets away with
impunity, and one more Palestinian, a schoolchild this time, is added to the long list of
the helpless victims of Zionist savagery.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Age-old racist attitudes prevail</b></u><br>
The case of Helmi al-Shousheh actually epitomizes official Israeli policies toward the
Palestinian people as a whole, which emanates from age-old racist attitudes toward
non-Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nahum Korman, a security officer at the settlement of Hadar Betar near
Bethlehem, was trained and indoctrinated in the Talmud, the Jewish holy books that treats
&quot;goyem&quot; (derogatory for non-Jews) as beasts whose lives are almost worthless,
especially if and when compared to a Jew's life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Yisrael Shahak's &quot;Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The
Weight of Three Thousand Years,&quot; the Talmud orders Jews to &quot;kill the best of the
gentiles&#133;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue (of semen) is like the
issue of horses.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This Talmudic injunction, needless to say, has always been relevant in the
annals of Zionist savagery toward Palestinians and Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The scandalous thing is that it is still applied in a variety of sinister
ways, not only by the murderous settlers, who view the murder of innocent Palestinians as
a &quot;Mitzvah&quot; or &quot;good deed with which God is pleased,&quot; but also by the
Israeli army, justice system and the overall apparatus of the Israeli State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this year, an Israeli soldier who murdered a Palestinian labourer
from the village of Dahiriya, 15 miles south-west of Hebron, was detained for only five
days before he was set free by the Israeli army commander of the West Bank. The commander
cited &quot;good conduct&quot; as a reason for pardoning the soldier. It was not clear
what good conduct the commander had in mind, but it was amply sufficient that he didn't
view the murder itself as &quot;bad conduct.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the Israeli justice system, which practices judicial
apartheid, often adds insult to injury when &quot;prosecuting&quot; Israeli soldiers and
settlers for murdering Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, a Tel Aviv court in 1996 fined two Israeli undercover
soldiers two agorot (roughly one quarter of a US cent) each for killing a Palestinian
labourer north of Ramallah while on his way to work inside Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the court decision, besides giving a definite green light
to murder Palestinians, carried a bluntly-racist message that an Arab life was not worth
even one US cent!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, persons guilty of murder, even mass murder, against Arabs are
allowed to rise to high public positions. An illustration of this, which Shahak mentioned
in his book, is the case of Shmeul Lahis, who was responsible for the massacre of 50-75
Palestinian peasants imprisoned in a mosque in the village of Dawaymeh after it had been
conquered by the Israeli army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following a pro-forma trial, he was granted complete amnesty, thanks to
Ben Gurion's intercession. The man went on to become a respected lawyer and in the late
1970s was appointed Director-General of the Jewish Agency, the executive tool of the
Zionist movement.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Children treated as terrorists-in-the-making</b></u><br>
If the murderer of Helmi Shousheh felt no scruples at killing his little victim while
returning home from school on the ground that &quot;he is just another Arab,&quot; the
Israeli army likewise seems to treat Palestinian children as a whole as
&quot;terrorists-in-the-making.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hebrew press reported last week that the Israeli army General Command
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip decided to toughen punishments for Palestinian children
involved in stone-throwing incidents.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the new amendments, the minimum age of prosecutable
Palestinian children will be reduced from 14 to 12, meaning that 12-year-olds will be
viewed and treated as adults bearing full responsibility for whatever they do.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The &quot;culprit&quot; children here will not appear before a juvenile
court, or anything of this sort, nor will they be questioned by a special officer who
would treat them, as children everywhere should be, with emphasis on behavioural reform
rather than punishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The children in this case will be interrogated by regular Shin Beth
interrogators whose <i>modus operandi</i> is physical and psychological torture (Israel is
the only country in the world where torture is sanctioned by the law).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This necessarily means that filthy-smelling sacks (or what is known as the
hooding technique) will be placed on the child&#146;s head for as long as needed to
&quot;straighten up their minds.&quot; (Hooding is always the first order of business in
the interrogation of Palestinians.) It could also mean that they will undergo another
notorious torture technique&#151;shaking&#151;in addition to other routine forms of
torture, such as sleep deprivation, sexual molestation, painful positioning and beatings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 19 August, the very same day the Israeli government decided to free the
longest-serving Palestinian prisoner, Khalil Ra'ei, the Israeli army arrested 15
Palestinian children at the Arroub refugee camp near Hebron for throwing stones at Israeli
army vehicles.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These children are almost certain to undergo a nightmarish experience at
the hands of Shen Beth's sadistic torturer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The question which everyone is prompted to ask in light of this barbarity
is: &quot;How will those children be for the rest of their lives?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, isn't Israel ultimately responsible for the
&quot;suicidal-bomber phenomenon&quot; as much as anybody else, perhaps more than anybody
else?</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></font><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">The Wye River
Agreement&#133;Back to Square One!</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</font><font size="3"><i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Mahmoud al-Khatib</i></b></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Until now, attempts have been exerted by some Arabs, and Palestinian
Authority officials in particular, to convince us that Israeli Prime Minister Barak is not
a carbon copy of his predecessor Netanyahu. For the first time since the coming to power
of General Barak, the PA&#146;s negotiators lost their nerve and became frustrated with
the prospect of achieving any progress in the negotiations between the PA and the Israeli
government on the implementation of the Wye River Agreement signed in October 1998 under
the patronage of the U.S. President. Several statements by the chief PA negotiator, Saeb
Ereikat, and other PA officials admitted that there was no genuine difference between the
terrorist Barak and the terrorist Netanyahu.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before the two sides reached what they called a &#147;partial
agreement&#148; on the release of a limited number of Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli
jails, the PA officials said they have returned back to square one since the resumption of
the negotiations between the Israelis and the PA that began after the victory of General
Barak in the Israeli elections last May. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the modest partial agreement, the Zionist regime will release
about 500 Palestinian prisoners in two batches&#151;the first in the beginning of
September and the second on 8 October. There are more than 3,000 Palestinian political
prisoners, mainly Hamas supporters, in the Israeli jails. The Israelis insisted that they
would not release any Palestinian who had his hands &#147;stained&#148; with Jewish blood.
Therefore, most of those who will be released are criminal prisoners who were detained for
ordinary crimes. This is exactly what happened with the first batch of prisoners (250
Palestinians) who were freed by Netanyahu in November 1998. That batch included only 100
political prisoners belonging to pro-Oslo groups, especially Fatah, and 150 prisoners who
were arrested for ordinary crimes such as car thefts and infiltration to 1948 Occupied
Palestine, so-called Israel, for work without permits from the Israeli government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Excepting this partial agreement, the PA officials failed to convince
Barak&#146;s government to implement the Wye River agreement from the point Netanyahu
stopped at, which is the redeployment of the occupation troops from 13% of the West Bank
and the construction of a &#147;safe passage&#148; between the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA&#146;s tragedy was that it found itself forced to negotiate with
the Israelis on issues that have been already agreed upon and included in authenticated
agreements. Every time the PA officials sign an agreement with the Israelis, they were
forced by the Israelis to reach a new agreement to implement the original one! When the
Cairo Agreement (Oslo 2) was signed, they went to the United States to negotiate the
implementation of that agreement which ended with the Wye River agreement. Now they are
negotiating a new agreement to implement Wye River! With every agreement, the Palestinian
Authority is the only side that is required to introduce relinquishments and to abandon
more legitimate rights of the Palestinian People.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis&#146; tactics in their negotiations with the PA officials are
very clear. They are aware of the fact, as the Israeli <i>Haaretz</i> daily put it, that
Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian leadership have become exhausted and tired and
therefore they want to reach any agreement with the Israelis no matter what the cost and
even if this solution will not survive! For Arafat, it is a matter of racing against time
in order to establish his authority; it is not a matter of legitimate rights of the
Palestinian People, which should not be sold out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyone who observes the reaction of the PA to the recent Jewish settlement
activities in the West Bank, which Netanyahu started last October and which were blessed
by Barak later, becomes certain that the PA has no concern for the Palestinian rights that
are confiscated by the Jewish settlers every day. The settlers have built about 20
settlements on the West Bank since last October. In addition, the Israeli government is
now planning to expand and fatten the already existing settlements. Barak&#146;s
government has already given the green light to the settlers to start construction works
at Ras Al-Amoud and to resume the works in Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) settlement in Occupied
Jerusalem. All this is being done even though all agreements between the PA and the
Israeli government state that Jewish settlement activities in Occupied Territories should
be stopped until an agreement about the final status of the settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza is reached.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak does not want to implement the Wye River agreement with the PA
because the longer the current situation continues, the more Palestinian land can be
confiscated by the Jewish settlers. He is not interested in signing a deal with the
Palestinians. Rather, he is interested in making deals with the Syrians and the Lebanese,
which are expected to be reached in one year.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">By: E. Yaghi</p>
</b><i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>(Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness&#146;
sake: for their&#146;s is the kingdom of heaven.)</strong></i></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the dead could speak, this is what I would say to you. My name is Helmi
Shousheh. On October 27, 1996, I was murdered by the armed Israeli settler, Nahoum Korman.
At the time of my death, I was only 11 years old. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps you might say that I, a Palestinian child, deserved to die. Maybe
I was throwing stones at an armed settler or at heavily armed Israeli troops. But this is
not the case. I was on my way home from school and more than anything, wanted to see my
mother and tell her about my day learning about the world in my classroom. Instead, this
killer of children chased me for no reason other than the fact that I was a Palestinian
child and unable to defend myself. First he hit me and then kicked me in the head. I fell
down bleeding. The cause of my death was repeated blows to my head by Korman&#146;s rifle
butt. I screamed out begging the man to stop beating me, but I knew he was out to end my
life and all my screams and all the blood that gushed out of my head did not stop him. I
want to emphasize that I never hated anyone in my life and never wished harm to any
person, including my killer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There were eyewitnesses who testified to Korman&#146;s brutality and these
eyewitness accounts were supported by the medical evidence of the Head of the Israeli
Institute of Forensic, Medicine, Dr. Yehuda Hiss.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is surprising to me is that not only was Korman acquitted on 16
August, at the Israeli District Court in Jerusalem, but that the judge was a female, Judge
Ruth Orr. That a female could take the death of a child so lightly is in itself a tragedy.
Judge Orr preferred to believe that, inspite of eyewitness accounts and the medical
evidence provided by Dr. Hiss, I had hit my head on a stone and thus died. Did she think
that the stone was so vicious to cause my death? She should have seen my body, especially
my head then after the cruel beating that no human or even animal should be forced to
endure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember my own mother and how she was so sensitive, soft and tender and
how when I was buried in my small shroud, stayed crying at my grave and asking why did I
have to die such a terrible death. But apparently, Judge Orr has no soft heart nor is she
sensitive to human pain like most women are.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the past 11 years, 300 Palestinian children have been murdered by
Israelis. Few of these killers have ever been charged and fewer still are convicted or if
convicted, have ever served their full prison sentence. How strange that confessions
extracted by torture from Palestinians are used as evidence against them and sends them
either back to prison, or to death. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The acquittal of Korman is a serious matter, not only for Palestinians,
who can be hunted down and slaughtered like big game in Africa, but for Israelis too,
particularly since Israel supports the presence and arming of Jewish settlers in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whenever civilians are armed, regardless of the reason, there is bound to
be conflict.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This acquittal will also encourage any Jewish settler to open fire or hunt
down any Palestinian adult or child they please and this is backed by the new Israeli
policy to prosecute children accused of stone throwing. Stones are hurled by the hands of
the small against the oppression and occupation. We, the Palestinian children, are the
Davids of today and the Israeli occupation is Goliath. This Goliath has no mercy or heart.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My innocent blood indelibly stains not only Korman&#146;s hands but Judge
Orr&#146;s too and all those who make certain that Palestine remains occupied by an unjust
force that has no legal, historic, or moral right to be there. My tomorrows were gone
before I even had a chance to plan or dream or live. I shall not enter heaven until I take
the hand of my mother once she passes away and together, we shall live in a place where
there is no war, no hate, and where children regardless of whether they are Palestinian or
not, are free.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> (August) - Sheikh Dr. Yousuf al-Qaradawi is one of
the most erudite contemporary Muslim scholars. His ability to find Islamic answers to many
of the problems facing Muslims nowadays gained him a clarion reputation throughout the
Muslim world and even in the West. Last week, Qaradawi was interviewed by the Gaza-based
Islamist weekly <i>al-Istiklal</i>. The following are excerpts of what he said.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: How do you see the future of the Arab-Israeli conflict?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: The conflict will continue; its smouldering embers will not be
extinguished and its mill will not stop moving as long as there is a usurper and oppressor
on the one hand and an oppressed and victim on the other hand. The oppressor may gain the
edge for some time, owing to his military strength, but time is not on his side and won't
be in the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The regimes may give in under pressure and surrender, especially if they
happen to be defeated from within. However, the peoples and their vital forces,
particularly the Islamists, will not succumb to oppression and will not lend recognition
to the illegal usurpation. This is a matter of faith; it is also the seed for victory in
the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, there are many signs and glad tidings in the Qur&#146;an that the
Zionist power will recede sooner or later. Today, they are basking in their arrogance of
power, but this won't last for a long time, and once this rope is severed, they will fall
down, because their rope connected with God was severed a long time ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionists will incur the heavenly wrath as they did in the
not-too-distant past. So if they returned to bloodshed, oppression and mischief on earth,
as they are doing now, the Almighty will visit them with destruction and vengeance again,
and that is what will undoubtedly happen.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: How do you view normalization between Muslims and the
Zionist regime?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: The processes of normalization with the Zionist regime are
prohibited and unacceptable from the Shariah standpoint. This normalization necessarily
involves a recognition by Arabs and Muslims of Zionist sovereignty over the lands that
they usurped and arrogated from the Muslims. It also involves a recognition on our part
that our beloved towns and villages, such as Haifa and Akka among others, are no longer
Arab, and this is unacceptable and shouldn't be tolerated. If this normalization was in
the context of a truce, then it would be arguable, but this normalization is part of an
imposed settlement&#151;similar to capitulation&#151;and true Muslims shouldn't despair of
God's victory, no matter how long it is deferred.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: What do you think about foreign military presence in the
Arab world? What are its goals and long-term effects?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: The foreign military presence in the Arab world is in fact a
new imperialist invasion. Some people project it as taking place with the consent of the
governments concerned, but in reality it is imposed on them. The foreign presence doesn't
serve the interest of the peoples of the region. On the contrary, it is there to achieve
certain goals for Israel first, and for the interests of the imperialist States themselves
and finally to exert pressure on the governments and closely monitor their moves and
thwart any kind of unity among Arabs and Muslims in this region. So, the foreign presence
constitutes a grave danger to our independence, development and unity potentials. The
scandalous thing about it, however, is that it is sustained at our expense as we pay the
bill at the end of the day.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: How do you view the Islamic resistance in Lebanon and
Palestine, including the martyrdom operations?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: The Islamic resistance in Lebanon and Palestine represents the
glorious face of the Muslim Umma and serves as an example to that effect. As for the
martyrs, I have issued a religious edict blessing the martyrdom operations in which a
given Muslim fighter turns himself or herself into a human bomb that casts terror in the
hearts of the enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for the edicts that were issued against the Mujahideen, it is important
to point out that they were tendentious and made by unreliable ulema who don't possess
genuine knowledge of Islam; they are the ulema of the palace who often act as mouthpieces
for the regime, so they mislead people while they are misled themselves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These heroes are carrying out the duty of Jihad on behalf of the entire
Umma. The liberation of Jerusalem and al-Masjidul Aqsa is a collective and individual duty
which no Muslim can claim doesn't concern him. This duty is not biding for the Palestinian
people alone but concerns all Muslims everywhere in the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, if every Jew the world over considers himself responsible for the
survival of and well-being of Israel, likewise every Muslim should be responsible for the
liberation of al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If we can't carry out acts of Jihad ourselves, we at least should support
and prop up the Mujahideen financially and morally so that they will be steadfast until
God's victory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jihad and Resistance is our fate and destiny; it is a duty upon us. We
should counter Menachem Begin's slogan, &quot;I fight, therefore I exist,&quot; with
Sheikh Ahmed Yasin's motto, &quot;I resist, therefore I exist.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This resistance is a divine Sunna (way) and without it the forces of
arrogance and aggression will have the upper hand and the forces of truth and justice will
suffer and be defeated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nobody should doubt any effort in this regard. The lowest degree of
resistance is the economic, social and cultural boycott of the enemy; we should reject all
forms of normalization with the Zionist regime, we must make sure that the psychological
barrier stays there. We must also educate the Umma about the Zionists and their dangers
and expose those among us who seek to foster despair and defeat in the ranks of Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, we must warn the Palestinians against pointing their guns against
each other, because the common enemy is there and the fundamental contradiction is and
should remain with the Zionists.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: What is the future of Islam in this changing world?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: I see that the future belongs to this &quot;wasati&quot;
(moderate) Islamic movement, because the Islamic umma is inherently a moderate umma as
indicated by the Qur&#146;an. The Islamists shouldn't give in to hopelessness, for a
Muslim lives perpetually with the hope for a better tomorrow. The source of this hope is
God himself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the Qur&#146;an and the traditions of the Prophet (May the
peace and blessing of God be upon him) contain clear signs that the future belongs to
Islam. In any case, the present situation of the Islamic movement is better than it was a
few decades ago and is getting even better. This a slow movement, but its success is
certain in the long run.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: How do you see the relation between Islam and pan-Arabism?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: Arabism has a strong relation with Islam; the Arabic language
is the language of the Qur&#146;an and the ritual language of Islam. Moreover, the land of
the Arabs was the cradle of Islam and there the sacred mosques and places are located. In
the final analysis, an Arab is one who speaks Arabic, and in many parts of the Muslim
world, especially in the Maghrib countries, there is no difference between being Arab and
being Muslim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, contradictions arise when Arabism takes a secular, non-Islamic
direction. But there are extremists in the Arabist and Islamist camps. And while it is
absolutely unacceptable that Arabism be placed above Islam or takes precedence before it,
it is also equally unacceptable on the part of some Islamists to brand all Arab
nationalists as &quot;kafir&quot; or disbelievers. A constructive dialogue between the two
camps is always positive, and this direction should be encouraged.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></font><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">The PA cultural conspiracy</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</font><font size="3"><i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Since its establishment over five years ago, the
Palestinian Authority of Yasser Arafat has been steadily trying to spread &#147;modern
culture&#148; among the mostly conservative and religious Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, for the PA, &#147;modernity&#148; hasn&#146;t meant, as one would
expect, such positive features and values as fostering a culture of democracy, human
rights, civil rights, civil liberties, nor, indeed, the establishment of the rule of law
whereby everybody from the President downward is subject to the authority of law.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, these things are still rare species in the PA political and
cultural dictionary. Instead, the PA&#146;s &#147;modern culture&#148; has chiefly meant
the encouragement of moral and behavioural laxity (especially among the youth) such as
alcohol consumption, prostitution, sexual deviance, belly-dancing, casinos and many of the
things that otherwise are considered promiscuous in the conservative and Islamic culture.
(It is said that in Nablus alone the PA gave licenses for 45 bars in which alcoholic
beverages from the locally-produced Arak to the fine Scottish whisky are served.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This summer, the West Bank and Gaza Strip have witnessed as many as ten
&#147;carnivals,&#148; an increase by 50% compared to 1998. Most of the events bore the
titles of &#147;artistic&#148; and &#147;cultural.&#148; In reality, however, the
carnivals featured little or no meaningful cultural activity one can speak of. Indeed,
Palestinian critics, including people associated with Fatah, often complained that naked
thighs and naked breasts were more conspicuous than anything else. This indicated that the
carnivals had more in common with the nudity culture of Sau Paulo and Rio de Janeiro than
with the conservative Palestinian culture of Nablus, Hebron and Bethlehem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides the brazen display of feminine flesh, the
&#147;fa&#146;aliyat&#148; or activities were very low in quality. This led some of the PA
commentators and columnists to dismiss this year&#146;s carnivals as
&#147;scandalous.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hafez al-Barghouthi, editor-in-chief of the PA semi-official newspaper, <i>al-Hayatul
Jadida</i>, described the atmosphere at one of the carnivals in Ramallah in these words:
&#147;There was a crescendo of noise, harmful to the ears&#151;disharmonious and
discordant&#151;and we still dare call it art.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barghouthi lashed out at the organizers of the events, arguing that
instead of promoting the cultural awareness among Palestinians, the carnivals actually did
the opposite. He cited the &#147;almost promiscuous intermixing of young people of both
sexes in ways that debase and disgrace our national dignity and pride.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>PA responsible for corrupting youth</u></b><br>
It is amply clear that the Palestinian Authority, probably in connivance with Israel and
the CIA, is responsible for the dissemination of this cultural promiscuity among
Palestinians. And the reason, or ill-motive, behind this is no less than a sinister
endeavour to corrupt the Palestinian youth and the Palestinian population at large in
order to make them forget &#147;Palestine&#148; and enter the new Israeli age.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA claims, falsely of course, that its goal is the liberation of
Palestine and the establishment of a free and independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem
as its capital. However, one is tempted to wonder how can this sublime goal be served by
hosting bands of barely-dressed belly-dancers and other symbols of seduction whose only
message to the Palestinian youth is &#147;don&#146;t worry, be happy!!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the Palestinian Authority seems to be convinced that the
way to liberate Jerusalem and the Aqsa Mosque is by mobilizing an army of singers,
belly-dancers and by spreading the culture of &#147;don&#146;t worry, be happy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is not an overstatement in any way. The Authority, which opened the
largest casino in the Middle East in Jericho only twenty minutes&#146; drive from the Aqsa
Mosque, will only promote the &#147;casino culture,&#148; which really means prostitution,
drug-addiction, fornication, adultery and other forms of permissive lifestyles.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there is a clear political dimension to the PA policy in this effect.
For while Jewish settlements continued to expand at the Palestinians&#146; expense, the
morally bankrupt and politically discredited Palestinian Authority continued to display
total impotence in the face of continued Zionist insolence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 5 August, a PA Culture Ministry official insisted on opening the
&#147;Halhul Cultural carnival&#148; on time, despite the fact that the Old Town of Hebron
was languishing under curfew. When asked why the Ministry didn&#146;t identify with the
people under curfew, the official said, &#147;We would like to show the Israelis that we
are not affected by their repression.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Ministry of Culture is in fact the chief culprit in PA efforts to
introduce and deepen cultural estrangement among Palestinians. Indeed, the Minister of
Culture, Yasser Abed Rabbu, on many occasions attacked the Palestinian Islamic culture,
labeling it as &#147;dark&#148; and &#147;backward.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abed Rabbu, a former communist-turned-liberalist, who is often called
&#147;Yasser Abed Yasser&#148; or &#147;Yasser slave of Yasser (Arafat)&#148;, remarked
numerous times that &#147;with the liberation of Palestine, the Palestinian people have
the right to be happy and to dance in order to spit off the Zionists who don&#146;t want
us to be happy or look happy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But happiness, in Abed Rabbu&#146;s views, has not meant delivery from
Zionist shackles (which have never been tighter), nor freedom from the spectre of
arbitrary arrest and prolonged internment without charge or trial in order to please and
appease the Zionists. It only meant &#147;the culture of love and joy,&#148; in their very
negative sense.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, that culture of love and joy, as advocated by the PA, is based
first and foremost on arousing the sexual lusts of young men and women so that satiating
these lusts will eventually become the youth&#146;s main or only preoccupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That culture, needless to say, has already bred its first fruits in the
form of several incidents of rape and sexual assaults (rape was nearly absent in the
Palestinian society before the advent of Yasser Arafat&#146;s Authority).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, by inviting scores of famous Arab singers to the
self-rule areas, the PA is actually acting as &#147;middle man&#148; for normalization
between the Zionist regime and the Arab world. This is shameful, to say the least, and
there is no other word to describe it except that it is &#147;treachery.&#148; It is clear
to everyone that any Arab wishing to come to the self-rule enclaves has to check first
with the Zionists who control the borders between the autonomous enclaves and the outside
world. So, the PA is procuring in essence Arab normalizers with the Zionists, and at no
price.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>PA only serves the enemy</u></b><br>
It is lamentable that the Palestinian people have reached such a disgraceful and
despicable state of affairs under the PA junta. This should awaken the Palestinian people
to the reality of and truth about the PA, the revolutionary vanguard that turned into a
quisling gang in the service of the enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Certainly, the liberation of Jerusalem doesn&#146;t need misfits like
Mustafa Kamar and Ragheb Alama and other symbols of cultural and moral degeneration. The
liberation of the Muslim holy shrines in Jerusalme requires real heroes like Salahuddin
al-Ayyubi, Sultan Qutz and Muhammed al-Fath. It needs real Mujahideen, not drunken punks
dancing till the later hours of night.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before the catastrophe of 1967, a large sector of Arab youth in Syria,
Jordan, Egypt and Palestine was classified in accordance with their preference for and
identification with a given contemporary Arab singer. Thus, there were the &#147;Abdul
Halim Hafez camp&#148;, the &#147;Farid al-Atrash camp&#148;, the &#147;Um Kulthoum
camp&#148;, etc. The result of this tragic craze was seen in the early morning hours of 5
June. Everybody knows the rest of the story.</p>

Zionist Occupation</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</font><font size="3"><i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Majid Abu Diyak</i></b></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Palestinian Authority, a Palestinian youth, Akram Alqam,
ran down a number of Zionist soldiers with his car in Bet Shemesh near Occupied Jerusalem
and was also a car thief and a drug addict. If this were true, one could say that the
resistance of the Occupation is backed by all categories of Palestinian people. This
proves that the resistance programme, which is led by Hamas, has achieved a very large and
a very significant political success. It also shows that the PA&#146;s programme, which
was mainly put in place to combat the Palestinian Resistance in cooperation with the
Zionist Occupation troops, has ended with a big failure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the alleged drug addict succeeded in running over 10 Zionist soldiers,
we can imagine how many soldiers would be liquidated by &#147;sane&#148; Palestinians who
have a chance similar to that which was seized by Alqam!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This conclusion is based on a trust that does not exist between the
majority of the Palestinian People and the PA. The same thing was said about Ahmad
Abdel-Hameed, who ran down scores of Zionist soldiers in Ashkelon in 1996, killing one
soldier and injuring 22 others. But later it was announced that he was &#147;sane&#148;
and belonged to the Islamic Jihad group.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA&#146;s accusation that Salim Sarsour, who killed a Zionist Rabbi in
Hebron in 1997 and who carried out several military operations against Zionist soldiers,
was an agent for the Israeli secret service, Shabak, is another example of the PA&#146;s
credibility. An Israeli court sentenced Sarsour to life imprisonment, which refutes the
PA&#146;s allegations that he was a collaborator with the Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is evident that the PA seeks to deform the image of the Palestinian
Jihad, especially after its failure to liquidate the Palestinian Resistance despite the
assistance provided to the PA by Israel and the United States to do so. The PA wants to
show that this resistance is a result of the state of desperation that can attack some
people. It even alleges that the Islamic Resistance is the result of an alliance between
the Zionist Right and the Palestinian Resistance in order to abort the Oslo accords! This
allegation is what the PA tried to hint at after shooting two Zionist settlers in Hebron
in the month of July before the military wing of Hamas announced its responsibility for
the attack. But the continuous facts prove that the PA&#146;s attempt to pollute the
Islamists&#146; reputation was a failure and that the majority of the Palestinian, Arab
and Muslim people support the Palestinian resistance of the Zionist Occupation before and
after the Oslo accords, and will continue to do so during Barak&#146;s era as they did
during Netanyahu&#146;s era.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas succeeded in keeping the resistance programme alive despite the
pressure exerted by both Israel and the PA to abort it. It also succeeded in recruiting
sinful persons, hoping their resistance of the occupation would grant the movement
remission. This proves that the resistance is still the only option the Palestinian People
believe in to restore their legitimate rights and not the futile negotiations with which
the PA is involved!</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">No Memorials in Israel for Bernadotte</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Daud Abdullah *</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Less than 24 hours after submitting his report to the General Assembly,
the first United Nations mediator to Palestine was dead. Folke Bernadotte was shot at a
roadblock in Jerusalem by Jewish extremists on 17 September 1948. His killers told the Tel
Aviv bureau of <i>Agence France Presse</i> that all United Nations Observers in Palestine
were members of foreign occupation forces which had no right to be in their territory.
There was much more behind the crime than hostility toward the UN. Bernadotte&#146;s
insistence on the unconditional right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes
was, apparently, the immediate and real cause for his murder. His tragic memory will,
therefore, endure as long as the Palestinians remain Stateless and scattered throughout
the world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the outset of his mission, Bernadotte appeared well disposed to the
Zionists. Influenced by events in Europe during the Second World War, he, like most
Westerners, cultivated a noticeable sense of sympathy for the Zionists. He saw in their
settlement of Palestine the fulfilment of biblical prophecy. As a result,
Bernadotte&#146;s original views on key political issues, such as partition and Jerusalem,
were radically compromised during the four months between his appointment and his
assassination. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the question of partition, evidence from the Mediator&#146;s diary
confirms that he disapproved of the plan before his arrival in the region. Bernadotte
initially believed that the partition plan was a gross mistake that was bound to lead to
war. He, therefore, favoured a unitary State with &#145;far-reaching rights&#146; for the
Jews. This view was, however, noticeably altered in his 27 June 1948 report which called
for a union of two members, one Arab, including Transjordan, and the other Jewish. By the
time the UN Mediator submitted his final report on 16 September, he had again shifted from
his union proposal to that of recognition of Israel&#146;s <i>de facto</i> existence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the same manner, Bernadotte made a similar 180-degree turn on the
crucial question of Jerusalem. Prior to his departure for the Middle East, he intimated to
the French Foreign Minister, Georges Bidault, his considered opinion that Jerusalem should
be included in Arab territory and not given international status. By September, however,
Bernadotte had substantially changed this view. This was reflected in his last progress
report which recommended that the city of Jerusalem &#147;should be treated separately and
should be placed under effective United Nations control.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding these about-turns, the one outstanding area in which the
Mediator remained resolutely consistent was that regarding the Palestinian refugees. He
had absolutely no doubt that their uprooting and exile was caused by the systematic
&#147;terror and ravages of war.&#148; Indeed, if ever he demonstrated any change on this
issue, it was the fact that he became increasingly uncompromising and insistent on their
right of return. For whereas in June his report merely stated that the &#147;refugees
should be entitled to return to their former places of residence&#148;, his September
recommendations had become decidedly urgent and specific. It read: &#147;The right of the
Arab refugees to return to their homes in Jewish controlled territory at the earliest
possible date should be affirmed by the United Nations, notwithstanding the views
expressed by the provisional government of Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;<u><b>Those were the days</b></u><br>
Although Bernadotte stepped out of tune with the Arab position on partition and Jerusalem,
his stand on the refugee problem did strike a distinct chord with popular sentiments and
official policies throughout the region. By demanding that the refugees be allowed to
return &#145;at the earliest possible date&#146;, he was in effect underlining that their
return was neither dependent upon the conclusion of a formal peace nor on the engagement
of negotiations with the Zionists. Those, however, were the days when there was consensus
and resolve among Arab States that there should be no direct negotiations with Israel
unless and until the refugees were allowed to return. Today, the situation is incredibly
different. Arab consensus has now become a relic of history as regional leaders cue,
openly and secretly, to negotiate with Zionist Israel. Hence, the one reality that has not
changed since is the tragic and inhuman circumstances of the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When compared to the statements of previous Israeli leaders, the public
declarations of the Barak regime offer virtually no hope to the dispossessed and exiled
Palestinians. In a letter to Bernadotte dated 1 August 1948, the country&#146;s first
Foreign Minister, Moshe Shertok, promised &#145;when the Arab States are ready to conclude
a peace treaty with Israel&#146;, the question of the refugees will be raised as part of a
general settlement. Speaking to the American public in an NBC interview recorded by Tim
Russert on 14 August 1999, Israel&#146;s Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, declared &#147;I
don&#146;t think the refugees will be able under any circumstances to come back into
Israel.&#148; Count Bernadotte must surely have turned in his grave when he heard the
celebrated soldier-politician add: &#147;But a better solution for them should be found in
the countries where they are living now.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given the shameful reluctance of the United Nations to commemorate the 51<sup>st</sup>
anniversary of Bernadotte&#146;s assassination, Middle East watchers hoped, albeit against
hope, that Mr. Barak would have used his visit to New York to lay the foundation of a
Folke Bernadotte Memorial or institute for refugee and forced migratory studies. Surely
such a gesture would have signalled the commencement of the &#147;fresh start&#148; which
he so piously promised in his earlier meetings with Messrs Mubarak and Arafat. Besides, it
would also have been a timely and most appropriate way of expressing thanks to the UN for
its unparalleled role in creating the Jewish State in Palestine. And, above all, it would
have been a truly honourable way of paying tribute to the 4.5 million Palestinian refugees
who, against all odds, preserved their national identity and kept their dream of return
alive. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, at a time when international terrorists, military dictators
and war criminals are hunted down on every continent and brought to book, Mr. Barak could
even have used his high-profile visit to New York to announce a reopening of the
Bernadotte murder case. Did the chain of command begin and end with the two Polish
immigrants, Nathan Yellin-Moor and Matitiahu Schmulevitz, who were arrested two months
after the killing? Or, did it extend to the co-commander of the Stern Gang, Yitshak
Shamir, who was himself directly implicated in the crime? Certainly a judicial review of
this outrage would be a welcomed giant step toward the peace of the brave which Barak
publicly calls to.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Red Lines</b></u><br>
Back in the Middle East, diplomatic encounters with the new Israeli administration have
all been depressingly farcical. None of the regional leaders who met with Barak have shown
the courage to admit their disappointment, frustration and misgivings. They have, instead,
all appeared before the world&#146;s media telling tales of &#145;constructive&#146;,
&#145;positive&#146;, &#145;meaningful&#146; and &#145;historic discussions&#146;. There
was nothing in their press statements that indicated a willingness to call Mr.
Barak&#146;s numerous bluffs. The Palestinian leadership was given one such golden
opportunity during the &#147;heart-to-heart talk&#148; between Chairman Arafat and Prime
Minister Barak. The latter, it was reported, used the occasion to emphasize the need for
both leaders to be truthful and avoid deluding their peoples. According to <i>Ha&#146;aretz
</i>(16/7/99), the Israeli leader told Arafat that &#147;We also have &#145;red
lines&#146; that we are not prepared to cross, and we will have to obtain the agreement of
both our nations for every move we make.&#148; This is all well and good. For every
Palestinian acknowledges that the right of return is their RED LINE that cannot be
retracted. Will Mr. Barak, therefore, allow the 4.5 million refugees to exercise this
right if they choose to do so?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While the new Israeli leadership has refused to consider a return even to
Palestinian administered areas, waves of Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants continue to
flood into occupied Palestine. The Central Bureau of Statistics in the Jewish State
confirmed that with the arrival of 29,000 immigrants during the first half of 1999, there
has been a 14.5% increase over the same period last year. Notwithstanding, Israeli
researchers Gershon Shafir and Yoav Peled believe that according to the ultra-orthodox
definition of who is a Jew, 20% of those who arrived at the beginning of the 1990s were
non-Jews. Additionally, 60% fell into that same category by the mid-1990s.<sup>1</sup>
Given his obvious determination to maintain this <i>status quo</i>, it is no wonder that
Mr. Barak should have appealed to President Clinton to act only as a
&#145;facilitator&#146; and not as an &#145;enforcer&#146; in the future negotiations with
the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When stripped of their diplomatic garb, the terms &#145;facilitator&#146;
and &#145;enforcer&#146; mean nothing to the Israeli political establishment. For what is
the difference between Bernadotte as &#145;mediator&#146; and Clinton as
&#145;facilitator&#146;? Or, on what basis would they accept the latter after they have
repudiated the legacy of the former? Was it not Bernadotte who said, &#147;I interpret my
role as Mediator not as one involving the handing down of decisions on the future of
Palestine, but as one of offering suggestions on the basis of which further discussions
might take place and possibly counter-suggestions be put forth looking toward a peaceful
settlement of this difficult problem.&#148;<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, the UN Mediator may have failed in his objective to bring about the
demilitarization of Jerusalem and the return of the refugees. Yet, he did succeed in one
respect. As he intended, Bernadotte succeeded in putting forward recommendations which, 51
years after his death, have remained the internationally accepted legal basis and point of
reference for any settlement of the refugee problem. They were enshrined in UN resolution
No. 194 in 1948 and have since been reaffirmed every year by the General Assembly. <i>&#147;That
the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live in peace with their neighbors
should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.&#148;</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The right of return as envisaged by Bernadotte is one, which under the
present circumstances only requires affirmation and implementation. It is not a privilege
that demands debate or recognition. And, herein lies the fundamental difference between
Bernadotte the &#145;mediator&#146; and Clinton the &#145;facilitator&#146;. While the
former maintained that the unconditional right of the refugees to make a free choice
should be upheld and guaranteed, the latter believes that it should be defined and
negotiated. Because of their unqualified support for the latter, the Israelis will
certainly offer no memorials to mark the 51<sup>st</sup> anniversary of Bernadotte&#146;s
murder. </p>

Of The Wye River Memorandum</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">(2-3)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Wye Memorandum</font></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Wye memorandum is basically divided into two parts, &#147;Further
Redeployments&#148; and &#147;Security.&#148; (A third section takes up miscellaneous
&#147;Other Issues.&#148;) Bits and pieces comprising some 40 percent of the West Bank are
to come under &#147;full&#148; (Area A) or &#147;partial&#148; (Area B) Palestinian
jurisdiction before final-status negotiations begin. According to Savir, Rabin was
prepared to relinquish &#147;roughly 50 percent&#148; on the eve of final-status
negotiations.11 The putative ideological rift between Labor and Likud amounts to perhaps
10 percent of the West Bank. Indeed, the various final-status maps of the Likud all fall
within the parameters of Labor&#146;s Allon Plan, retaining for Israel roughly half the
West Bank.12 For those who care to hear the truth, the Israeli press has been reporting
for years that &#147;there&#146;s almost no difference between Netanyahu&#146;s and
Peres&#146;s concepts of the permanent agreement,&#148; indeed, &#147;Sharon and Peres are
not far from each other in their perception of the permanent settlement.&#148;13 This
pragmatic convergence between Labor and Likud points up, incidentally, that partial
withdrawal was the maximum Israel could have hoped for at Oslo. Israel did not effect a
&#147;historical compromise&#148; with the Palestinians; only with reality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Technically, Wye marks a regression from &#147;prior agreements.&#148; At
bare minimum the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip (hereafter: Interim Agreement) stipulated a &#147;complete redeployment of Israeli
military forces from Area B&#148; before final-status negotiations (Article XIII), placing
30 percent of the West Bank in Area A. The memorandum, however, puts only 18 percent of
the West Bank in Area A. Yet, this quibbling over percentages is ultimately beside the
point. The &#147;Palestinian Authority&#148; exercises no substantive authority anywhere
in the West Bank &#151; except as Israel&#146;s surrogate. The &#147;security&#148;
provisions of the Wye Memorandum make this abundantly clear. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The security section of Wye initially observes that &#147;both sides
recognize that it is in their vital interests to combat terrorism and fight
violence.&#148; Yet to implement this protocol, Wye specifies an action plan only for the
Palestinian side: &#147;The Palestinian side will make known its policy for zero tolerance
for terror and violence. ... A work plan developed by the Palestinian side will be shared
with the U.S. ... to ensure the systematic and effective combat of terrorist
organizations. ... In addition to the bilateral Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation,
a U.S.-Palestinian committee will ... review the steps being taken to eliminate terrorist
cells. ... In addition to the bilateral Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, a
high-ranking U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli committee will ... address the steps being taken to
combat terror and terrorist organizations,&#148; and on and on. One would never suspect
from this document that, according to the Israeli human rights organization,
B&#146;Tselem, many more Palestinians have been killed by Israelis than Israelis by
Palestinians since the onset of the Oslo process (356 Palestinians as against 251 Israelis
through October 1998). The &#147;vast majority&#148; of killings by Israel, according to
Amnesty International, were &#147;unlawful.&#148;14</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Wye also repeatedly emphasizes Palestinian responsibility for the vigorous
&#147;investigation, prosecution, and punishment&#148; of &#147;terrorist suspects.&#148;
Yet according to Amnesty, &#147;there continues to be almost total impunity for unlawful
killings of Palestinians&#148; by Israel: &#147;[I]nvestigations are inadequate. The
officers responsible rarely appear before an inquiry; if they do so they are rarely
punished; if they are punished the sanction is trivial in relation to the loss of
life.&#148; To illustrate this last point, Amnesty cites the case of four soldiers
convicted of killing a Palestinian motorist: &#147;The court fined each soldier one agora,
equivalent to about US$0.03.&#148; Indeed, although Israeli soldiers have killed fully
1,500 Palestinians since the beginning of the intifada, not one has served any prison
time.15</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Wye memorandum reeks of the rancid Israeli (and American) discourse on
terrorism. Terrorism is a self-generating force. It originates in the &#147;terror support
structure,&#148; &#147;terrorists and their structure,&#148; &#147;terrorist organizations
and their infrastructure,&#148; &#147;terrorist cells and the support structure that
plans, finances, and supplies and abets terror,&#148; &#147;organizations (or wings of
organizations...) of a military, terrorist, or violent character,&#148; and &#151; lest we
forget &#151; the &#147;external support for terror.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Detached from its Israeli environment, Palestinian terrorism is always the
cause but never the effect of evil: assaulting Israeli innocents is by definition
unrelated to Israel&#146;s brutal rule. Thus, to understand terrorism, it is irrelevant
that, since the Oslo accord, more than 600 Palestinian homes have been demolished and
140,000 dunums of Palestinian land confiscated. It is also irrelevant that, due primarily
to Israel&#146;s illegal imposition of closure on the eve of Oslo, the Palestinian
standard of living has fallen by nearly 40 percent, with fully 30% of the workforce
unemployed and fully 40 percent of the population living at or below the poverty line.16</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given that terrorism is an implacable negative force, the only means to
combat it is an implacable positive force: repression. And in this Manichaean struggle
between good and evil, the more repression the better: any restraints will impede the
struggle. Accordingly the Wye memorandum gives short shrift to human rights concerns,
despatching them in one sentence: &#147;without derogating from the above, the Palestinian
Police will ... implement this Memorandum with due regard to internationally accepted
norms of human rights and the rule of law. ...&#148; Presumably on account of its
exemplary human rights record, Israel is not called upon to do even this much. Indeed, the
record does impress. According to Amnesty, even after Oslo, Israel continued to engage in
&#147;mass arrests of Palestinians;&#148; place &#147;thousands of Palestinians&#148;
under administrative detention without charges or trial, sometimes for &#147;years on
end&#148; (&#147;many may have been prisoners of conscience&#148;); &#147;use torture
systematically on Palestinian political suspects ... its use was effectively legal, an
internationally unprecedented state of affairs&#148; (&#147;this legalization of torture
has, over the past five years, if anything, become a more entrenched part of the system in
which Palestinian detainees find themselves&#148;); resort to &#147;brutality, amounting
to torture or ill-treatment ... at checkpoints&#148;; and conduct &#147;unfair trials ...
convictions are almost invariably based exclusively on the accused&#146;s confession,
usually extracted by the use of torture and ill-treatment.&#148;17</p>

&#147;there are still 3,700 Palestinians held in prisons inside Israel&#148; (<i>Third

without charge or trial, often in harsh conditions, constitute arbitrary detention&#148;
and as such are illegal under international law; cf. <i>Israel&#146;s Record of
Occupation: Violations of Civil and Political Rights (August 1998).</i> Amnesty reports
that 800 Palestinians suffer torture by Israel every year and that a ministerial committee
approved the use, beginning in 1994, of &#147;increased physical pressure,&#148; adding
that, &#147;Torture continues to be used in Israel because the majority of Israeli society
seems to accept that the methods used are a legitimate means of combatting
&#145;terrorism&#146;.&#148; An Amnesty news release underlined that &#147;Israel is the
only country on earth where torture and ill-treatment are legally sanctioned&#148; (9 May
1997). With its extensive use of torture, Israel ranks, according to the special U.N.
rapporteur on torture, in the same category as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan (<i>The
Independent</i>, 27 March 1997). Indeed, according to Human Rights Watch, pending Israeli
legislation and court rulings &#147;could greatly expand the extent and severity of
Israeli use of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment&#148; (<i>Memorandum to
U.N. Committee Against Torture: May 1998;</i> cf. Amnesty International, <i>Five Years</i>).
Regarding Israel&#146;s justification of torture to avert imminent terrorist attacks,
Amnesty stated that, apart from its absolute prohibition under international law,
&#147;Torture is used systematically against hundreds of Palestinians every year, even in
situations where no &#145;ticking bomb&#146; is involved. The mockery of this argument is
shown by the fact that in the majority of cases interrogators take weekends off, using
interrogation methods constituting torture only from Sunday to Thursday&#148; (News
release, 14 January 1999). In addition to effectively legalizing torture, Israel has also
legalized hostage-taking, with the Supreme Court sanctioning the use of Lebanese nationals
as &#147;bargaining chips;&#148; cf. Human Rights Watch, <i>Israel&#146;s Record, and
Without Status or Protection: Lebanese Detainees in Israel (October 1997)</i>, and Amnesty
International, <i>Israel&#146;s Forgotten Hostages &#151; Lebanese Nationals Held
Unlawfully for Years in Detention (July 1997).</i> Denouncing the Supreme Court decision
as &#147;contemptible&#148; and &#147;intolerable,&#148; Amnesty stated: &#147;Those held
as hostages include people who were only 16 when they were taken from their villages and
have now spent up to 11 years in detention, often secret and incommunicado. These are real
people, not objects to be used as political pawns&#148;; also that &#147;When an armed
group holds hostages it is universally condemned. The Israeli Government has acknowledged
that the detainees mentioned in the Supreme Court ruling pose no threat to state
security&#148; (News Releases, 6 March 1998, 18 March 1998).</small></p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Edna Yaghi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><em><strong>(Dedicated in memory of Ziad)</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i>It&#146;s as you said Cherrit, lend not your strength to that which
destroys you.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Ziad. Soon, I have heard, I am to be released just as the
longest held prisoner was released before me a few weeks ago. My companions in prison have
been cockroaches that grow as big as nightmares, mice and weevils. For a long time, I was
held in solitary confinement so I had to devise ways to keep myself sane. Perhaps I am not
so sane after all, for how could any human hold on to sanity after spending 30 years in an
Israeli prison?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It all began during the Battle of Karami, 21 March 1968. I was a newly
enlisted soldier with the Jordanian army and the oldest of 10 children. I had never eaten
army food before or really had to obey any orders other than those of my father, who at
the time, I felt, was too hard on me. Little did I know the real meaning of hardship or
cruelty or suffering.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was not as if I did not love my parents. I loved them dearly. It was
not as though I did not care for my younger brothers and sisters. It was only that in my
secluded and protected world, I saw myself as an abused young man who was expected to help
out with my father&#146;s booming business in his butcher shop right in the heart of
Amman, Jordan. My father really did try to make me a man; it&#146;s just that at 20, I
really had no conception of what the demands of manhood were. Certainly not incarceration,
certainly not torture, and certainly not the loss of my own humanity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having served only 1 month in the Jordanian army, while on a short weekend
leave, I stormed into my father&#146;s shop and declared, &#147;That&#146;s it! I&#146;m
not going to eat army food any longer.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My father gave me an allowance that would enable me to buy chocolate,
cookies and other kinds of food that would sustain me so that I, spoiled as I was, would
not have to eat army food. But even this did not satisfy me enough to keep me from
deserting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was born in Palestine in 1948, just before all Palestinians on the coast
were either forced out of their homes and land or were frightened away. Atrocities such as
those committed at Deir Yassin by the Israeli Haganah, where an entire village was
barbarically wiped out, were still fresh in the minds of my grandparents and parents. Only
a few months old and carried in my mother&#146;s arms, I was oblivious and unaware of that
sad and tragic journey that separated my family and their beloved orange groves and their
homes that they had lovingly built with their own hands. And so, I spent part of my youth
growing up in a refugee camp in Jericho, the lowest place on earth and also one of the
hottest. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My father was strong and young and brave. Even though he lost all his land
and home, he learned how to get milk from a bird and I survived and soon my other brothers
and sisters followed in childbirth and my mother learned how to skimp and crawl on her
hands and knees when her strength gave out, and how to make silk out of a sow&#146;s ear.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We moved to Jordan and my father raised beef for his butcher store and we
did well. Very well. So well that I soon forgot the fact that I was a refugee. But I had
to help out with feeding the cattle and the butchering. I thought I was too good for that
kind of work, so, in order to escape my duties as a son, I ran away to enlist in the
Jordanian army. Army teaches people discipline, and I really did not want to be
disciplined. I just wanted to escape home duties and be free from all responsibility. To
my dismay and shock, I was not free at all. I had to eat army food and obey army rules.
This definitely was not a life for such as me. So I ran away from the Jordanian army and
during the Battle of Karami, went over to the Palestinian Freedom fighters in the valley
of Karameh, Jordan, who had joined forces with the Jordanian army and together in unity,
we defeated the invading Israeli army. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But in total glory of my first real victory, I was defeated and captured
by Israeli soldiers. Gone were my days of youth and freedom, gone was my family. I never
again would hear my father yell at me, &#147;Come on Ziad, you overslept again! Get up and
come and help me open the store.&#148; In fact, never again would I hear my father&#146;s
voice at all.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Deep in an Israeli dungeon, unknown to the rest of the world, after being
tortured by Israeli soldiers on a daily basis until I fainted, I would recall scenes of
home and my mother and father and younger siblings. Their images were all that kept me
alive in the beginning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I knew my father would leave no stone unturned to find me. I knew that he
would look everywhere. I heard rumours that he in fact did. But, my name was never given
out to the Red Cross by the Israeli authorities and as far as all the world was concerned,
I did not exist. My father soon gave up hope of ever finding me and I was told by a fellow
prisoner who knew my father that he dedicated his life to raising my other siblings and
had given me up for dead. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Beatings and torture made me rebellious. I kept getting into trouble in
those Israeli dungeons deep under the ground, and solitary confinement became the norm for
troublemakers like myself. I grew a beard. At 30, I felt and looked like an old man. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The only solace I had in the sweltering summer heat was to fall asleep
dreaming of my family and how beautiful my life had been when I was with them in Jordan.
Why didn&#146;t I appreciate what I had then? Why did I run away from the Jordanian army
and why did I, more than anything, run away from my parents, the people who loved me more
than themselves? Why had I been such a careless fool?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Later, after spending years and years in Israeli prisons and being shifted
from one Ansar hellhole to another, I tried to be a bulwark for newly captured Palestinian
youths who faced torture and some certain death. I tried to teach them ways so that their
torture would not hurt so much; but no matter how brave you are, no matter how you brace
yourself to resist pain, there is no escape and no mercy and even an old pro like me would
end up screaming and cussing at those animal-like and brutal torturers who left no trace
of anything human in helpless and defenseless prisoners such as myself and others.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I prayed to God to release me from my bondage, to free me from my pain, to
let me die to escape the living death I was forced to endure. I am 51 years old now. It is
not as though I have celebrated my birthdays, only kept track of my days spent in prison
to prove to myself that I am still sane. But I seriously doubt my own sanity and I have no
grasp about life outside prison walls at all. I am not used to the kind of laughter that
shakes your belly when you laugh. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My mother will not recognize me. If she has grey hair, my own is white. If
she is bent with age, my body is bent from affliction. Prison friends told me that my
father died a few years ago from cancer and that all my brothers no longer live in Jordan.
My eyes, still blue but faded, are unused to sunlight and the whites have browned from the
tears and pain that they have witnessed. It is rumoured that I am soon to be set free. But
where will I go, and what will I do? No woman will marry an old man like me and even if I
were ever able to find someone foolish enough to marry me, I am too weak to work to
support a family or even myself. My life has been destroyed and I have nothing to live for
at all, not even the hope of being set free at last.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though I am a prisoner of war and have been one for 31 years, I was never
treated like one. Forget about the Geneva Convention. I cannot turn back time or erase all
that I have suffered. But my greatest wish is that those who persecuted me for no reason,
those who so inhumanely tortured me, would one day feel and know what it is like to lose
your humanity.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>(19 -19)</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>By Israel Shahak</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The persistent attitudes of classical Judaism toward non-Jews strongly
influence its followers. Orthodox Jews and those who can be regarded as its continuators,
zionists. Through the latter it also influences the policies of the State of Israel. Since
1967, as Israel becomes more and more &#145;Jewish&#146;, so its policies are influenced
more by Jewish ideological considerations than by those of a coldly conceived imperial
interest. This ideological influence is not usually perceived by foreign experts, who tend
to ignore or downplay the influence of the Jewish religion on Israeli policies. This
explains why many of their predictions are incorrect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, more Israeli government crises are caused by religious reasons,
often trivial, than by any other cause. The space devoted by the Hebrew press to
discussion of the constantly occurring quarrels between the various religious groups, or
between the religious and the secular, is greater than that given any other subject,
except in times of war or of security-related tension. At the time of writing, early
August 1993, some topics of major interest to readers of the Hebrew press are: whether
soldiers killed in action who are sons of non-Jewish mothers will be buried in a
segregated area in Israeli military cemeteries; whether Jewish religious burial
associations, who have a monopoly over the burial of all Jews except kibbutz members, will
be allowed to continue their custom of circumcising the corpses of non-circumcised Jews
before burying them (and without asking the family&#146;s permission); whether the import
of non-kosher meat to Israel, banned unofficially since the establishment of the state,
will be allowed or banned by law. There are many more issues of this kind which are of a
much greater interest to the Israeli- Jewish public than, let us say, the negotiations
with the Palestinians and Syria.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attempts made by a few Israeli politicians to ignore the factors of
&#145;Jewish ideology&#146; in favour of purely imperial interests have led to disastrous
results. In early 1974, after its partial defeat in the Yom Kippur War, Israel had a vital
interest in stopping the renewed influence of the PLO, which had not yet been recognised
by the Arab states as the solely legitimate representative of the Palestinians. The
Israeli government conceived of a plan to support Jordanian influence in the West Bank,
which was quite considerable at the time. When King Hussein was asked for his support, he
demanded a visible <i>quid pro quo. </i>It was arranged that his chief West Bank
supporter, Sheikh Ja&#146;abri of Hebron, who ruled the southern part of the West Bank
with an iron fist and with approval of then Defence minister Moshe Dayan, would give a
party for the region&#146;s notables in the courtyard of his palatial residence in Hebron.
The party, in honour of the king&#146;s birthday, would feature the public display of
Jordanian flags and would begin a pro-Jordanian campaign. But the religious settlers in
the nearby Kiryat-Arba, who were only a handful at the time, heard about the plan and
threatened Prime Minister Golda Meir and Dayan with vigorous protests since, as they put
it, displaying a flag of a &#145;non-Jewish state&#146; within the Land of Israel
contradicts the sacred principle which states that this land &#145;belongs&#146; only to
Jews. Since this principle is accepted by all zionists, the government had to bow to their
demands and order Sheikh Ja&#146;abri not to display any Jordanian flags. Thereupon
Ja&#146;abri, who was deeply humiliated, cancelled the party and, at the Fez meeting of
the Arab League which occurred soon after, King Hussein voted to recognise the PLO as the
sole representative of the Palestinians. For the bulk of Israeli-Jewish public the current
negotiations about &#145;autonomy&#146; are likewise influenced more by such Jewish
ideological considerations than by any others.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conclusion from this consideration of Israeli policies, supported by
an analysis of classical Judaism, must be that analyses of Israeli policy-making which do
not emphasise the importance of its unique character as a &#145;Jewish state&#146; must be
mistaken. In particular, the facile comparison of Israel to other cases of Western
imperialism or to settler states, is incorrect. During apartheid, the land of South Africa
was officially divided into 87 per cent which &#145;belonged&#146; to the whites and 13
per cent which was said officially to &#145;belong&#146; to the Blacks. In addition,
officially sovereign states, embodied with all the symbols of sovereignty, the so-called
Bantustans, were established. But &#145;Jewish ideology&#146; demands that no part of the
Land of Israel can be recognised as &#145;belonging&#146; to non-Jews and that no signs of
sovereignty, such as Jordanian flags, can be officially allowed to be displayed. The
principle of Redemption of the Land demands that ideally all the land, and not merely,
say, 87 per cent, will in time be &#145;redeemed&#146;, that is, become owned by Jews.
&#145;Jewish ideology prohibits that very convenient principle of imperialism, already
known to Romans and followed by so many secular empires, and best formulated by Lord
Cromer: &#145;We do not govern Egypt, we govern the governors of Egypt.&#146; Jewish
ideology forbids such recognition; it also forbids a seemingly respectful attitude to any
&#145;non-Jewish governors&#146; within the Land of Israel. The entire apparatus of client
kings, sultans, maharajas and chiefs or, in more modern times, of dependent dictators, so
convenient in other cases of imperial hegemony, cannot be used by Israel within the area
considered part of the Land of Israel. Hence the fears, commonly expressed by
Palestinians, of being offered a &#145;Bantustan&#146; are totally groundless. Only if
numerous Jewish lives are lost in war, as happened both in 1973 and in the 1983-5-war
aftermath in Lebanon, is an Israeli retreat conceivable since it can be justified by the
principle that the sanctity of Jewish life is more important than other considerations.
What is not possible, as long as Israel remains a &#145;Jewish state&#146;, is the Israeli
grant of a fake, but nevertheless symbolically real sovereignty, or even of real autonomy,
to non-Jews within the Land of Israel for merely political reasons. Israel, like some
other countries, is an exclusivist state, but Israeli exclusivism is peculiar to itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to Israeli policies it may be surmised that the &#145;Jewish
ideology&#146; influences also a significant part, maybe a majority, of the diaspora Jews.
While the actual implementation of Jewish ideology depends on Israel being strong, this in
turn depends to a considerable extent on the support which diaspora Jews, particularly US
Jews, give to Israel. The image of the diaspora Jews and their attitudes to non-Jews, is
quite different from the attitudes of classical Judaism, as described above. This
discrepancy is most obvious in English-speaking countries, where the greatest
falsifications of Judaism regularly occur. The situation is worst in the USA and Canada,
the two states whose support for Israeli policies, including policies, which most
glaringly contradict the basic human rights of non-Jews, is strongest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">US support for Israel, when considered not in abstract but in concrete
detail, cannot be adequately explained only as a result of American imperial interests.
The strong influence wielded by the organised Jewish community in the USA in support of
all Israeli policies must also be taken into account in order to explain the Middle East
policies of American administrations. This phenomenon is even more noticeable in the case
of Canada, whose Middle Eastern interests cannot be considered as important, but whose
loyal dedication to Israel is even greater than that of the USA. In both countries (and
also in France, Britain and many other states) Jewish organisations support Israel with
about the same loyalty which communist parties accorded to the USSR for so long. Also,
many Jews who appear to be active in defending human rights and who adopt non-conformist
views on other issues do, in cases affecting Israel, display a remarkable degree of
totalitarianism and are in the forefront of the defence of all Israeli policies. It is
well known in Israel that the chauvinism and fanaticism in supporting Israel displayed by
organised diaspora Jews is much greater (especially since 1967) than the chauvinism shown
by an average Israeli Jew. This fanaticism is especially marked in Canada and the USA but
because of the incomparably greater political importance of the USA, I will concentrate on
the latter. It should, however, be noted that we also find Jews whose views of Israeli
policies are not different from those held by the rest of the society (with due regard to
the factors of geography, income, social position and so on).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why should some American Jews display chauvinism, some- times extreme, and
others not? We should begin by observing the social and therefore also the political
importance of the Jewish organisations which are of an exclusive nature: they admit no
non-Jews on principle. (This exclusivism is in amusing contrast with their hunt to condemn
the most obscure non- Jewish club which refuses to admit Jews.) Those who can be called
&#145;organised Jews&#146;, and who spend most of their time outside work hours mostly in
the company of other Jews, can be presumed to uphold Jewish exclusivism and to preserve
the attitudes of the classical Judaism to non-Jews. Under present circumstances they
cannot openly express these attitudes toward non-Jews in the USA where non-Jews constitute
more than 97 per cent of the population. They compensate for this by ex- pressing their
real attitudes in their support of the &#145;Jewish state&#146; and the treatment it metes
to the non-Jews of the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How else can we explain the enthusiasm displayed by so many American
rabbis in support of, let us say, Martin Luther King, compared with their lack of support
for the rights of Palestinians, even for their individual human rights? How else can we
explain the glaring contradiction between the attitudes of classical Judaism toward
non-Jews, which include the rule that their lives should not be saved except for the sake
of Jewish interest, with the support of the US rabbis and organised Jews for the rights of
the Blacks? After all, Martin Luther King and the majority of American Blacks are
non-Jews. Even if only the conservative and Orthodox Jews, who together constitute the
majority of organised American Jews, are considered to hold such opinions about the
non-Jews, the other part of organised US Jewry, the Reform, had never opposed them, and,
in my view, show themselves to be quite influenced by them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Actually the explanation of this apparent contradiction is easy. It should
be recalled that Judaism, especially in its classical form, is totalitarian in nature.
&#145;Be behaviour of supporters of other totalitarian ideologies of our times was not
different from that of the organised American Jews. Stalin and his supporters never tired
of condemning the discrimination against the American or the South African Blacks,
especially in the midst of the worst crimes committed within the USSR. The South African
apartheid regime was tireless in its denunciations of the violations of human rights
committed either by communist or by other African regimes, and so were its supporters in
other countries. Many similar examples can be given. The support of democracy or of human
rights is therefore meaningless or even harmful and deceitful when it does not begin with
self-critique and with support of human rights when they are violated by one&#146;s own
group. Any support of human rights in general by a Jew which does not include the support
of human rights of non-Jews whose rights are being violated by the &#145;Jewish
state&#146; is as deceitful as the support of human rights by a Stalinist. The apparent
enthusiasm displayed by American rabbis or by the Jewish organisations in the USA during
the 1950s and the 1960s in support of the Blacks in the South, was motivated only by
considerations of Jewish self-interest, just as was the communist support for the same
Blacks. Its purpose in both cases was to try to capture the Black community politically,
in the Jewish case to an unthinking support of Israeli policies in the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, the real test facing both Israeli and diaspora Jews is the test
of their self-criticism, which must include the critique of the Jewish past. The most
important part of such a critique must be detailed and honest confrontation of the Jewish
attitude to non-Jews. This is what many Jews justly demand from non-Jews: to confront
their own past and so become aware of the discrimination and persecutions inflicted on the
Jews. In the last 40 years the number of non-Jews killed by Jews is by far greater than
the number of the Jews killed by non-Jews. The extent of the persecution and
discrimination against non-Jews inflicted by the &#145;Jewish state&#146; with the support
of organised diaspora Jews is also enormously greater than the suffering inflicted on Jews
by regimes hostile to them. Although the struggle against antisemitism (and of all other
forms of racism) should never cease, the struggle against Jewish chauvinism and
exclusivism, which must include a critique of classical Judaism, is now of equal or
greater importance.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The world through the eyes of the media</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">By Rana Dajani</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Reading through <i>Newsweek </i>magazine (3 May 1999), an article about
Sudan caught my attention. It was entitled &quot;Out of Bondage&quot;. It related how a
group of Christians (CSI: Christian Solidarity International) were attacking slavery in
Sudan by putting a price tag on freedom. It also related accusations against the
Islamic-fundamentalist regime in Khartoum of arming and financing local Arab militia that
prey on blacks in the southern war zone, claiming that these tribes in the name of Islam
were abducting women and children and treating them brutally without mercy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My initial reaction as a Muslim and an avid supporter of Sudan was
defensive, but as I read through the article, I became convinced that something wrong was
going on in Sudan. I tried to analyse the facts to create an explanation that would
satisfy my previous beliefs and incorporate the new facts. I could not reach a
satisfactory conclusion other than that slavery was being practiced in the name of Islam
with no plausible explanation. This conclusion left me somewhat skeptical and not very
comfortable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After a week or so, I happened upon another article in a magazine which I
frequently read, namely <i>Al-Mujtama</i> (issue No. 1347, 27 April-3 May 1999 [Year 30]),
addressing the same issue. The article contained a larger number of facts and went back a
couple of years reviewing the history of the problem and the institutions involved,
explaining and giving a comprehensive and satisfactory view of the issue&#151;an approach
very different from <i>Newsweek</i>, which article had, for the most part, related a few
stories and quotes, leaving the readers to draw their own conclusions without giving
enough facts. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The <i>Al-Mujtama</i> article explained that the abductions and looting
were a result of tribal feuds and had nothing to do with religious differences. It also
went on to say that the Sudanese government was fighting these practices and had called a
press conference to clear up the accusations by the human rights groups. The article shed
light on the Christian Solidarity International (CSI) organization, which had a long
history of fighting Sudan because it is an Islamic country. The article went on to explain
that by focusing on the issue of slavery, CSI conjured to gather sympathy and credibility
for itself and resentment and evidence against the Sudanese government. This was achieved
by pouring money into Sudan supposedly to free slaves while to the contrary it fueled the
trade and encouraged more slavery among the tribes in the South.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One's reaction at first to these two seemingly contradictory reports is:
&#147;Who is telling the truth?&#148; But as one reads more and uses one&#146;s common
sense and logic, one can develop a coherent picture of what is really going on.
Nevertheless, two points should be taken into consideration whenever one is analysing
news: first, the power of the media in forming people&#146;s views of current and
international issues and second, who is in control of the media.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To avoid such misconceptions among the general public in the future, and
to allow people to develop a true picture of what is really going on, the following points
are of utmost importance: </p>

<ol>
  <li>More coverage of events supported with more facts;</li>
  <li>More writers reflecting various points of view;</li>
  <li>A wider distribution of news to reach a wider range of people. </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bringing the truth to the public is a responsibility hanging upon the
shoulders of every journalist who has a conscience.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Are Charities for Countries or for People?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">By Alex Mal'ouf*</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Millennium Gift Aid project has been widely publicized in both the
national press and on television commercials. The project aims to &#147;support education
and anti-poverty projects in the world&#146;s poorest countries till the beginning of the
next century&#148;, through tax relief on donations from individuals and businesses alike.
In a speech last year Chancellor Gordon Brown said:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Millennium Gift Aid will make it easier for businesses and
individuals to play a crucial role in reducing the disadvantaged, both in living
conditions and in opportunity, in the world&#146;s poorest countries. Tax incentives of
this kind are one way of encouraging charitable giving to help those who are truly in
need.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This sounds ideal for charities such as Medical Aid for Palestinians, the
Red Crescent, and UNIPAL, which organization works in Palestinian refugee camps in both
Gaza and the West Bank as well as other Arab countries. The one group of people who are
truly in need live in refugee camps across the Middle East and have done so for in many
cases over 50 years. The creation and expansion of the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East is testament to that fact, as is its
budget. Of UNRWA&#146;s regular budget, 65% is spent on education. As to combating
poverty, even in 1982 UNRWA was supplying 832,000 refugees with rations on a sustained
basis. Few other people in the world need charitable aid more than the Palestinian
refugees, without a country to provide them with the basic amenities needed for decent
living conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, those charities working with the refugees are not eligible
for Millennium Gift Aid. The Chancellor stated that &#147;countries&#148; were eligible.
Countries under the scheme total 80 and include China, India, Pakistan and Albania. As the
refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria do not constitute a country, then charities
working with the refugees are not chosen for consideration, despite the living conditions
under which the refugees exist. The same criteria applies to charities working with the
Kurds and the Timorese. It seems that the problem the Palestinians have endured all their
lives still haunts them even now, 50 years on. How can a person be considered, his or her
needs be cared for, or obtain justice, if that person has no State?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The details of Millennium Gift Aid can be altered, as they were during
April with the crisis in Kosovo. Charities working with Kosovar refugees were awarded Gift
Aid status, allowing them to raise money from tax relief to provide for the refugees&#146;
needs. This undoubtedly gave those charities a great boost, allowing them to do more than
they could have done if Millennium Gift Aid had not been altered to benefit more than only
countries, but also peoples. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kosovo at the present does not constitute a country any more than the
Palestinian Autonomous Areas. If Kosovar refugees could gain Millennium Gift Aid, then why
couldn&#146;t Palestinian refugees? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hopefully, as the scheme has been changed once, it can be changed again.
The only way for this change to be enforced is public pressure as with Kosovo, the
lobbying of government. Write to your MPs, ask them, plead with them, demand them to
change this restrictive and harmful policy. This wrong must be righted. Millennium Gift
Aid will not reach its goal, that of playing a crucial role in reducing the disadvantaged,
until those living in Sabra and Jabalia are considered for aid, as they should have been
in the first place. To again quote Gordon Brown: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I believe that many members of the British public will wish to
contribute towards programmes which will assist the poorest (countries) in the world to
improve education and health and alleviate poverty for their people.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr Brown, live up to your promise of last year, just ignore the word
&#147;countries&#148;. You did in April for the Kosovar refugees. Do it for the
Palestinians, too.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">When Hilary Came to Town</font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"></i><font color="#000000"><strong>By Ruth Anderson</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before Hilary Rodham Clinton decided to run as a senator representing the
State of New York, she changed her geopolitics and what little sympathy she had for the
Palestinians and their emancipation and immediately adopted realpolitiks, or for all
practicality, a more staunch pro-Israeli platform. After all, being very pro-Israeli, no
matter what the consequences for the Palestinians, will gain her more votes in a State
that has a large Jewish majority. The art of cronyism will benefit her in the long run.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I had a glimpse of how American politics work, or should I say the
theatrics of American politics, when Hilary paid a visit to Washington Park in Albany, New
York, which was on her list of barnstorming and whistle stops.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">People like me&#151;or the crowd, audience, whatever we happened to be at
that point in time&#151;had lined up in an outdoor theatre just to catch sight of the
First Lady. At the park theatre, there was an actual play being performed, and because I
was late, I had little idea as to its theme and, since it did not look very convincing
anyway, did not want to take the effort to find out more. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The people intrigued me, especially those who had flocked to the park and
walked from miles away just to catch sight of Hilary, regardless of whether they liked her
or not. There was a taste of royalty about the whole thing, an excitement of seeing
someone so close to power coming to a place where we, the humble and lowly subjects, would
congregate.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, Hilary was late. And just before her arrival, dark clouds
gathered in the dusk of the evening sky which hung like a navy-blue umbrella right over
Washington Park. The sound of thunder was more dramatic than the vain attempts by the
local theatre group to entertain a more than distracted audience. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, too, Secret Service personnel abounded here and there dressed
in dark or gray suits. To add to the colour of the moment, there were some mounted police
on fine, beautiful horses whose nostrils flared and tails swished impatiently sparked by
the frenzy of the crowd. Before the thunder boomed angrily across the sky, a cool breeze
floated over the crowd and pink and purple balloons were set free to decorate the canopy
of the sky like ornaments on a pastel Christmas tree.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you know anything about the politics in Palestine and the Occupied
Territories, you will find the contrast sharper between the soft, green, and lush rolling
hills at the park and the squalid conditions of a refugee camp anywhere in the Gaza Strip.
It is politics that keep the Palestinians suffering in these camps and it is politics that
make someone like Hilary Clinton act her part in her latest Academy Award feature.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But wait a minute! The Palestinians are real people we are talking about.
They are not merely actors on a stage or pawns on a chessboard. They are not the
untouchables that can one day be promised a fair deal and the next be totally ignored by
the same people who promised them that fair deal. What is left of their land has slowly
dwindled to practically nothing, and the State that they have waited for so long will
merely be a police State of paid Palestinian police informants to the same oppressors, the
Israelis. The difference now is that the oppression and the occupation will be doubled at
the expense of the Palestinians themselves. And the two large concentration camps of the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank will continue to be concentration camps surrounded by seas of
Israeli settlements and cities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Getting back to Hilary, she appeared on stage to the tune of thunder and
lightening. Members of the crowd, of which I was a part, either cheered her with,
&#147;Hilary, we love you!&#148; or jeered her with, &#147;Booooo, no we don&#146;t!&#148;
Just as Hilary graciously offered a few thank yous here and there, it began to pour.
Naturally, she was immediately sheltered by umbrellas conveniently whipped out of their
sheaths while her either adoring or dissenting audience got soaked to the bone.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, Hilary did not stay one minute longer than she had to
even though she was protected from the fury of the storm by her Secret Service agents, her
bodyguards, and her entourage. Making a graceful departure, she suddenly disappeared in a
whiff of mini-vans and rode off into the sunset with her silver bullet and newly adopted
sense of justice. All the questions that might have been asked by the indifferent, or
those who either hated or loved her, remained unanswered. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the crowd, now disgruntled or star-struck, disbanded as the
power and fury of the summer rain drenched them. More quickly than it had gathered, the
audience dispersed and each returned to their respective cars or their homes with the
dazzle of importance and ceremony still blazing in their heads and glittering in their
eyes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I found the rain refreshing and the air smelled clean and vivid, full of
life, as I walked to my car after the park incident. I found the audience exhilarating but
the thought of American politics frustrated me even though I know that anyone wishing to
run for office in the United States will not get far as long as they support a true and
just peace in the Middle East. Perhaps Hilary in her pre-run-for-Senate days felt a little
empathy with the Palestinians and their plight. At present, she sports feathers of a
different colour and now insists that the eternal capital of Israel should be in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Images of the lushness of the Washington Park landscape, the richness of
American power and the dust, heat and poverty of Palestinian refugee camps continue to
haunt me. Might is not right, but America as the only relevant superpower can now throw
her weight around and, whether right or wrong, fair or unjust, implement her foreign
policy to please herself and her Israeli counterpart. And this is really what Hilary is
all about. She is the new demagogue who will appeal and manipulate mass prejudices to gain
her a seat in the Senate at the expense of the Palestinian people and she will serve as an
ample mouthpiece for Zionists the world over.</p>
