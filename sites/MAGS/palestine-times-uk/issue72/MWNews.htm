<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Ibrahimi: This is my solution for the
crisis in Algeria</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Crisis is political but government does not want a political
solution</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>	</FONT><B><I>On the eve of the parliamentary elections
in Algeria, the first since the military seized power following the December
1991 overwhelming victory of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the elections,
Yasser Za'atreh conducted an interview with Dr. Abdel Hameed Al Ibrahimi,
a former Algerian Prime Minister (1984-1988) to shed more light on the present
crisis in Algeria.  Dr. Al Ibrahimi is now living in London heading a centre
for studies on North African affairs.</I></B></P>

<P><B>Q</B>. The military authority in Algeria is dealing with the local
crisis in two ways: security-wise and political-wise.  Let's start with
the security approach.  The government says the &quot;violence&quot; is
about to end.  Is it true? To what extent are the Islamic groups responsible
for the mass killings and bombings? Is the government involved in these
incidents? Is the FIS involved ?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. The crisis in Algeria which was created by the military coup
in January 1992 still exists and is becoming worse and more complicated.
 This is because the present regime is still insisting on using force and
suppression to remain in power and to preserve the illegal benefits it gained
at the expense of the general interests of the Algerian people.</P>

<P>	The crisis in Algeria is basically political.  But the regime does not
want a true political solution.  Instead, it insists on a military solution
despite the deterioration of security and economic and social conditions
in the country.  Moreover, the security policy that has been implemented
for the last five years has totally failed.</P>

<P>	As for the Islamic armed groups, they are penetrated by the military
intelligence service.  It is known that most of the mass killings and bombings
are made by the government itself whether through special forces or through
the local militias (about 200,000 armed men), but the government accuses
the Islamists of the violence.  All know that the victims of the mass killings
are Islamists or ordinary citizens well-known for their support of the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS).  Bombings always occur in quarters known to be affiliated
with the FIS.</P>

<P>	As a member of the National Liberation Front, and according to definite
information, I am sure that the FIS is absolutely not responsible for such
savage and criminal atrocities.  On the contrary, the FIS is a victim of
these atrocities and has condemned them on several occasions.  The military
regime has adopted this policy of terrorism to achieve a number of objectives,
such as:</P>

<P>- To wreak vengeance on members and supporters of the FIS until they
give up their political ambitions;</P>

<P>- To terrify the Algerian people who suffer from the deterioration of
the security and socio-economic conditions in the country in order to force
them to accept the political and dictatorial policy of the present regime;</P>

<P>- To deform, locally and abroad, the picture of the FIS and the Islamic
project in general;</P>

<P>- To mislead international public opinion so that the regime could obtain
additional financial, political, and diplomatic support from France and
other Western countries. The regime wants to show itself as the defender
of the West against fundamentalism in Algeria and as an acclaimed partner
in defending the French and Western interests in the region.</P>

<P>	I challenge the regime if it dares to set up an independent national
committee or to allow international committees such as human rights organizations
to investigate and verify the criminal atrocities being carried out in Algeria.
 Such investigations will definitely reveal the real criminals responsible
for these crimes.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. In the political approach, President Zirwal believes he gained
legitimacy after winning the presidential elections last November.  He also
believes that by the time parliamentary elections take place, he would close
forever the door on the crisis and achieve stability.  What is your comment
about such assumptions?</P>

<P><B>A</B>.  President Zirwal had promised in his electoral campaign in
November 1995 to rectify the situation and find a peaceful solution to the
Algerian crisis if elected.  But what has he done since his promise?  The
security situation has become worse and so has the socio-economic situation.</P>

<P>	The coming parliamentary elections will not solve the crisis.  They
could never be honest and free in the presence of military suppression,
political siege, misleading media coverage, the exclusion of real powers
and parties, as well as the confiscation of public freedoms.  The holding
of parliamentary elections under the current circumstances will certainly
complicate the crisis politically, socially, and economically in the same
way as the 1995 presidential elections did.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. Regarding the amendment of the Constitution, observers say
that President Zirwal granted himself many authorities and emptied the parliament
from its powers.  How do you assess these amendments and their political
impact?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. The amendment of the Constitution and the laws concerning parties
and elections was a strong blow in the face of democracy which has been
non-existent for the past five years.  These amendments aim to legitimize
the regime and marginalize the role of the Algerian people in political
life.  I consider these amendments an attempt by the regime to monopolize
political power and to disdain the Algerian people.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. Do you think that the establishment of the National Constitutional
Party means that it will be the regime's party as in some Arab countries
and that it will add a parliamentary majority to the President's powers?</P>

<P><B>A</B>.  Clearly, this newly established party will be the President's
party and it will officially become the major party in the country.  Through
the coming parliamentary elections, the regime wants to change the political
map in Algeria to serve its own interests.  But can the regime delete the
millions of votes that the FIS collected in the last elections by resorting
to such tactics?  Can the regime alter the fact that the people who are
suffering from suppression and poverty do not trust it? The answer is very
clear because the political crisis cannot be resolved unless the reasons
which caused the crisis are removed and unless the regime reverts to democracy
after putting an end to the bloodshed.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. The Algerian President stressed on various occasions that the
FIS was finished.  What do you say?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. The FIS is a main party in solving the crisis.  Excluding it
from the national dialogue and from the elections will lead the country
to a total deadlock as the case has been for the past five years.  FIS has
become more than a party; it is a political and social phenomenon which
is supported by millions of Algerians from various social and professional
categories in cities and villages.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. Some reports talk about conflicts between different factions
in the army.  What are the political consequences of such conflicts?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. The conflicts among the senior officers of the military institution
are not serious.  There is a large gap between the small pro-France leadership
that rules the country and the big number of junior peaceful officers who
want the Algerian army to withdraw from the political scene and stop suppressing
the people.  The latter also want the army to stick to the role assigned
to it by the Constitution which is to protect the national soil and to defend
the country against any possible external enemy.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. The French policy of dealing with the Algerian affair is confusing
and contradictory.  How do you assess this policy?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. I think the French policy concerning Algeria was always hostile
towards Arab Islamic tendencies that appeared in Algeria since its independence.
 We have information about its (France&iacute;s) role in the arrest of Abbas
Madani and Ali Balhaj (FIS leaders) in 1991 and in the January 1992 military
coup.  Since that time, France has been providing the Algerian regime with
military, political, diplomatic and financial support.</P>

<P>	Algeria's imports from France, for example,  increased from 17 per cent
of its total foreign imports in the late 1980s to 40 per cent in 1994. 
We also noticed that the prices of the products imported from France are
high, far in excess of such prices of similar products in the international
market.  This is because France enjoys a monopoly in the Algerian market.
 The Algerian Health Ministry, for example, discovered last summer that
prices of medicines imported from France (Algeria imports 90 per cent of
its medical supplies from France) were 65 per cent higher than their prices
in the French market itself (!)</P>

<P>	On the other hand, France is playing its Francophone card, which is
a an ideology it used to adopt in its old colonies within the context of
its struggle against the Arab Islamic civilization, especially in the fighting
of Islamic awakening in North Africa.</P>

<P>	France has been fighting Islamic and national movements in Algeria for
more than five years using &quot;France's party&quot; which dominates the
Algerian army and the important ministries.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. Observers can see a kind of &quot;courting&icirc; of the Algerian
regime by the U.S. Administration.  What is the significance of this courting?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. I do not think that there is a competition between France and
the United States over Algeria because the U.S., regrettably, considers
Algeria a French domain&oacute;a thing that is strongly rejected by the
Algerian people.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. How do you assess the economic situation in Algeria and what
are its political and social impacts on the future of the country?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. After the 1992 coup, the military authorities alleged that
the coming to power of the FIS through parliamentary elections (which were
later cancelled) would lead to the deterioration of the political and economic
situation in Algeria.  The following figures show what has been happening
since 1992:</P>

<P>1- More than 100,000 Algerians were killed.</P>

<P>2- The per capita income decreased from $2,500 in 1990 to $1,200 in 1995
(a reduction of 52 per cent in six years).</P>

<P>3- The agricultural production decreased by 25 per cent although the
population increased by more than 4 million in the last six years.  This
led to the increase of food imports which now form 90 per cent of the total
national food consumption amounting up to $3 billion a year.</P>

<P>4-The country&iacute;s industries are operating (except for petroleum
and gas) at only 20 per cent of their actual capacity which means that 80
per cent of the Algerian industries, except for the petroleum industries,
are now out of work.</P>

<P>5- Investment has been reduced to a level lower than it was before Independence.
 Food and industrial consumable imports form 49 per cent of total imports.
 The military expenditure increased by 45 per cent in 1994 and by 144 per
cent in 1995.  All of that was at the expense of the investment in production
sectors.</P>

<P>6- The unemployment rate rose to more than 30 per cent in 1996.  83 per
cent of the now 2.5 million unemployed Algerians are youth between 16 and
29 years of age.  The number of unemployed citizens is expected to increase
to 3 million after completing privatization of public establishments during
this year because more than 400,000 workers will lose their jobs to privatization.</P>

<P>7- For the first time since Independence, the general level of prices
increased by 40 per cent in 1994 while the prices of the foodstuffs increased
by 80 per cent which increased poverty among people and consumers.</P>

<P>8- The foreign debts increased from $26 billion in 1992 to $35 billion
in 1997 reaching a total of $40 billion if we add the military debts.  The
foreign debt is a heavy and serious burden on Algeria which, if the present
political situation continues, will lead to the deterioration of the economic
crisis in  the future.</P>

<P>	In brief, the Algerian people are now suffering from suppression and
poverty.  They are languishing in a valley of blood and tears.  The &quot;French
generals&quot; who control the military institution in Algeria are responsible
for this corrupt situation and for this destructive policy since 1992.</P>

<P><B>Q</B>. As a former Prime Minister in Algeria, what would be your perspective
on a solution to Algeria's crisis if you were requested to mediate?</P>

<P><B>A</B>. The present crisis in Algeria can be solved through the conducting
of a real and serious national dialogue between the government and popular
parties without excluding the Islamic Salvation Front.  This dialogue should
discuss means to stop bloodshed in the first instance and to revert to true
democracy in the second.  People should be given the right to elect their
rulers in full freedom, dignity and transparency.  Algeria is passing through
a transitional period in which a number of measures should be made to calm
down the situation.  These measures are:</P>

<P>1- The release of all political prisoners.</P>

<P>2- Lifting the siege imposed on the people.</P>

<P>3- Cancelling all arbitrary and suppressive laws that have been issued
since the military coup in 1992.</P>

<P>4- Allowing the public to enjoy their individual and public freedoms,
especially the freedom of expression and using all local media without discrimination.</P>

<P>5- Allowing all parties to practice their political activities and giving
them the right to rally and organize public meetings.</P>

<P>	This transitional period should continue for a short period of time
after which honest, true and free public elections should be held without
the exclusion of any political party.  The results of these elections should
be respected.  I believe the Algerian people know who the qualified candidates
are.  When qualified young leaders are elected and gain their people's trust,
economic and social reforms can be made easily and freely.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel flies in the face of Erbakan</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I>Occupied Jerusalem- By: Khalid Amayreh</I></B></P>

<P>Israeli military officials scoffed anew at Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan's efforts to scale-down strategic cooperation between Turkey and
Israel.</P>

<P>On Tuesday, 13 May, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said military
cooperation with Turkey, including joint naval exercises, would go ahead
despite Erbakan's objections.</P>

<P>Erbakan had earlier announced that the three-way Turkish-Israeli- American
navel manoeuvres slated for this summer were &quot;postponed to coming years.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The joint cooperation between Israel and Turkey, including the
naval exercise, is a common interest of both countries,&quot; said Avi Benyahu,
media advisor for Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, in reaction to Erbakan's
remarks.</P>

<P>Benyahu said Israel did not receive any information or an official announcement
to postpone the manoeuvres.</P>

<P>According to Israeli sources, the Israeli government has been urging
the anti-Islamic Turkish military to &quot;ignore Erbakan&quot; and &quot;to
put an end to his anti-Israeli stance.&quot;</P>

<P>Mordechai reportedly places great importance on the joint manoeuvres
with Turkey.  On Wednesday, 14 May, Mordechai was quoted by the Israeli
English daily, the Jerusalem Post, as saying that the navel exercises would
serve as a show of stability and strength in the eastern Mediterranean and
would help quell potential dangers.</P>

<P>The diplomatic talk, however, conceals a possessive desire on Israel's
part to outflank certain Arab and Muslim countries in the region, particularly
Syria and Iran, and to make sure that &quot;the military in Turkey maintains
its grip on power&quot; in the strategically important Muslim country.</P>

<P>Israeli intelligence circles reportedly recommended recently that Israel
continue to pay ample attention to developments in Turkey, particularly
to &quot;heightened Islamic awareness among Turks.&quot;</P>

<P>According to Israeli press reports, Israeli intelligence suggested that
Turkey would face a greater danger from Islamic fundamentalists than that
coming from the PKK.</P>

<P>Erbakan's surprise statement came just a week after the Deputy Chief
of Staff of the Turkish army, GTen. Cevik Bir, paid a publicized visit to
Israel.</P>

<P>On 14 May, Turkish generals vowed to go ahead with the slated manoeuvres
with Israel regardless of what Erbakan says.</P>

<P>One general was quoted as saying that &quot;matters of this kind are
none of Erbakan's business.&quot;</P>

<P>The latest mini-crisis reflected the stark dichotomy between the Islamist
Erbakan and the staunchly anti-Islamic Turkish army top brass who view Islam
as a threat to their grip on the Turkish people.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A LESSON FROM IRAN</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>BY: Khalid Mohammed</FONT></B></P>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem- In sharp contrast to the bleak state of affairs in
neighbouring Arab countries, where despots stay in power until death,  assassination
or senility, the sun of democracy rose last Friday in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz,
Mashhad and Tabris as well as other parts of Iran.  As many as 30 million
Iranians went to the polls to elect a new president to replace incumbent
President Hujattul Islam Ali Akbar Hashmi Rafsanjani whose term of office
is due to expire in August.  And in ways largely unknown in the Third World,
and Iran is a Third World country, the presidential election passed smoothly,
quietly and peacefully, without being marred by violence or bloodshed&oacute;a
genuine manifestation of civility. More important, however, the election
was held in a free and fair atmosphere, as testified to by friends and foe
alike, and tacitly recognized by the enemies of truth in Tel Aviv and Washington,
and some regional capitals, who impatiently wait for the &quot;winds of
doom and gloom&quot; to engulf the Islamic Republic.</P>

<P>Indeed, the Iranian regime, contrary to all American and Israeli-disseminated
propaganda and misinformation, seems to have succeeded in the problematic
test of democracy.  The fact that the &igrave;candidate of the regime&icirc;
failed in the face of  the &quot;candidate for change&quot; Muhammed Khatimi,
without causing any compunction in the executive branch, demonstrates that
Iran (regime and people) has moved a long way toward political maturity
without sacrificing its Islamic values.  The fact that the Iranians have
been able to replace an incumbent president by a new one peacefully and,
above all, freely, speaks volumes as it stands in stark contrast to what
happened in Algeria six years ago and the bloody civil war that has rocked
that North African country ever since. </P>

<P>So, hail to Iran, and &quot;Mubarak&quot; to President Khatimi whose
mission has just begun; and so many thanks to President Rafsanjani who oversaw
this carnival of Islamic democracy.  But the most special thanks must go
to Hujattul Islam Ali Akbar Natek Nuri, who not only accepted the will of
the people with exemplary sportsmanship, but sought to congratulate Khatimi
for his victory. </P>

<P>May we learn from Iran.  Indeed, we have much to learn<BR>
