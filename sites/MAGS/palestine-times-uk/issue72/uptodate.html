<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">More reactions to anti-Islam posters in Hebron</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- PT (30 June)</font></b><font SIZE="+1">
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The posting by Jewish settlers of  anti-Islam leaflets
in Hebron on 28 June continued to draw angry reaction among Muslim leaders
in Palestine and the Arab community at large, with large demonstrations
being planned for the weekend.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hassan Thbub, who assumes the Wakf  portfolio in the Palestinian
Authority,  accused the Israeli government of  &quot;preparing the fertile
ground in which such people can grow and thrive.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They can not just claim that it is an individual
act. They know well that this perception of Islam is quite rife among the
settlers and a significant segment of the Israeli populace,&quot; said Tahbub.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1"> In Hebron itself, political, religious  and civic leaders
reiterated their condemnation of the sacrilegious act at a meeting which
they held at the University Graduate Union building Sunday afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Ahmed Tamimi, deputy interior minister of the Palestinian
authority, pointed out that the poster, which depicted the Prophet of Islam
as a pig writing the Quran, was symptomatic of Jewish thinking.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;It reflects their way of thinking and their perception
of Islam, the Quran and our Prophet, May God's Peace and Blessing be upon
him,&quot; said Tamimi before more than 500 local leaders.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Tamimi opined that the profane poster was the moral equivalent
of a massacre.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The person, or persons, who can do this, won't hesitate
to perpetrate a massacre against Muslims, &quot; said Tamimi</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Tamimi called on Muslims to treat &quot;this blasphemy
in the same way that Imam Khumeini dealt with Salman Rushdi's Satanic Verses...because
there can be no greater crime than profaning our Prophet and Holy Book.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Muhammed Jamal al Natshe, a representative of the
Islamic Resistance Movement, said the proper response to this &quot;not
unexpected profanity&quot; should be to encourage further Islamic revival
throughout the world.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;When those lowly settlers see Muslim states persecute
and incriminate Islamist activists, they are encouraged to attack Islam
and even profane the Messenger of God, may peace be on him, and the Book
of God,&quot; Said Natshe.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">  Arab Knesset members Abdul Wahhab Darawshe and Talab
AL Sane'i of the Arabic Democratic List paid a solidarity visit to Hebron
on Monday.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Speaking at Hebron City Hall following a meeting with mayor
Mustapha  Natshe, Talab al Sane'i rejected Israeli claims that distribution
of the anti-Islam poster was an individual act.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The Israeli government stands behind the settlers
among whom these morbid thoughts thrive; the government therefore is responsible
for the actions of  the perpetrators,&quot; said al Sane'i </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Shiekh Abdullah Nimre Darwish, a leader of the Islamic
Movement across the Green Line (Israel) dismissed official Israeli denunciation
of the poster as insufficient.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Condemnation of this despicable act is not enough;
the Israeli government should vacate the settlers from Hebron instead of
just waiting for the powder-kerg to explode said Darwish.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Hamed al Bitawi, a senior Islamist leader in Nablus,
said Muslims the world over are invited to defend and protect their religion
and their Quran.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This diabolical act is a flagrant aggression against
our Aqida (faith) that calls all Muslims to duty,&quot; said al Bitawi.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">It is noted though that Muslims in Palestine have refrained
from placing the blame on Jews collectively, especially after Prime Minister
Netanyahu, and Israel's Chief Rabbi Pakhshi Doron, expressed outrage at
the act.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, this reserved reaction doesn't cover the settlers
and Israeli soldiers stationing at the spots where the posters were distributed.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Palestinian sources, the soldiers refused
to stop or arrest the two perpetrators as they were pasting down the posters
on the doors of Arab shops, a charge that has not been denied by the Israeli
government.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities extended the remand
of 26-year-old Tatiana Sosskind who reportedly confessed to having pasted
the blasphemous poster in Hebron.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sosskind, a former immigrant from the former Soviet Union,
reportedly said during interrogation that &quot;this is my response to the
Arabs in Hebron.&quot; <br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Jewish settlers distribute anti-Islamic profanities
in Hebron</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Al Khalil (Hebron)- PT (28 June)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Jewish settlers today circulated blasphemous drawings,
profaning Islam, the Prophet Muhammed and Muslim's holy book, the Quran.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">One of the drawings caricatured the Prophet of Islam as
a pig with an Arab headdress, the kuffiya. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The word &quot;Muhammed&quot; in both Arabic and English
was written along the body of the hand-drawn beast, which was also pictured
holding a pen and writing the word &quot;al Quran,&quot; also in Arabic
and English, on two opposite pages of an open book upon which the animal
is trampling with its fore-feet.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The sacrilegious materials were distributed during early
morning hours along the Shuhada street and in the vicinity of two heavily-protected
buildings inhabited by Jewish settlers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Eyewitnesses said they saw three settlers in their early
twenties distribute the profane drawings near a closed Arab petrol station
adjacent to al Dabboya, a Jewish settler building opposite the Qurtuba primary
school, itself a frequent target of settler vandalism and rampage.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Naeil al Shuyoukhi, a cameraman working for AP, said the
settlers were distributing the papers &quot;in hasty manner but didn't seek
to hide their identity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They were behaving somewhat casually ...in a business-as-usual
manner.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The incident took place as Jews were observing the Sabbath.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">This presumably suggests that the usually observant settlers
viewed insulting Muslims, their Prophet and Holy Book as a sufficient excuse
for violating the Halachic strictures against performing any activity on
the Sabbath aside from acts of worship. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">This is not the first time Jewish settlers indulge in profanities
against Islam and Muslims. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Two years ago, the word &quot;Allah&quot; was found written
on women underwear that originated in Jewish settlements. Verbal profanities,
say Palestinians living in Hebron Old quarter, are &quot;a daily affair.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The vast majority of Jewish settlers in Hebron, as elsewhere,
subscribe to the ideas and ideals of Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish terrorist
settler who on 25 February, 1994, massacred 29 Muslim worshipers at the
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.<br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Israeli Piracy in Hebron</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Hebron- PT (27 June)</font></b><font SIZE="+1">
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In line with its brutal maltreatment of Palestinians, the
Israeli army raided a farm in Hebron on 22 June, beating and arresting Nabil
Natshe, 39, a local businessman and former deportee to Southern Lebanon.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to eyewitnesses, two helicopter gunships hovered
over the farm, located at the Singer outskirt within area (A) presumably
to photograph the farm. Soon afterwards, hundred of soldiers raided the
site and savagely beat up al Natshe, handcuffed him, and took him away to
an unknown destination.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Natshe's son, Naim, 15, said the &quot;criminal soldiers
beat up my father before our eyes, but we were helpless to do anything because
there were so many soldiers with so many guns.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Natshe's uncle, Isa, described the sudden raid and the
mistreatment of his nephew as &quot;an act of piracy and abduction that
is in line with characteristic Israeli savagery and brutality.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Isa expressed profound bitterness at Palestinian
Authority powerlessness to stop Israeli terrorism against the Palestinians
even within areas which are supposedly under exclusive PA control. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;You see they (PA police) can not do anything to stop
the Israelis...It seems they have carte blanche to do as they wish in our
'liberated' areas,&quot; said the 60-year-old man.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian sources pointed out that the operation, which
lasted for two hours, proceeded from the nearby settlement of Hagay on the
southern outskirts of Hebron opposite the farm. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hagay, like the tiny Jewish enclave in Hebron, has a few
Jewish families, but settler leaders hope to seize more Palestinian land
in the vicinity of the settlement for future expansion.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Natshe was among the 415 Islamist deportees (deported
to Lebanon by Yitzhak Rabin in 1992). In 1996, he was detained without trial
by the Palestinian Authority and remained in custody for over a year.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">It is not know whether al Natshe's brutal arrest by the
Israeli army was carried out in connivance with the PA security apparatus.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Lately, the Israeli army resorted to abducting &quot;undesirable&quot;
Palestinians on the roads, on checkpoints or even in the streets. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last month, Israeli soldiers abducted Sheikh Abdul Mjid
Atta, Imam of the Dheishe Refugee Camp's mosque as he stepped out of the
Wakf Department building in Bethlehem. Atta's whereabouts are not known.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Earlier, two busses carrying Hebron University students
were &quot;abducted&quot; near the Beit Fajjar interjection, 13 miles north
of Hebron. The buses and the passengers were held hostage for several hours
under sizzling summer heat. Eventually, the buses were let go only after
several students were taken to a detention camp without charge or trial.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Hebron may set pace for a new Intifada</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Al Khalil (Hebron)- PT (22 June) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Intermittent clashes between Palestinian demonstrators
and Israeli occupation soldiers in down-town Hebron continued unabatedly
for the second consecutive week. The clashes, which started on 13 June,
generally assumed a monotonous pattern whereby Palestinian youngsters would
hurl stones toward rather than at or on Israeli soldiers taking positions
along the &quot;partitioning line,&quot; with the latter responding rather
harshly with &quot;rubber bullets&quot; containing lethal iron nucleus,
tear gas, stun grenades, and eventually live ammunition. According to hospital
sources in Hebron, around 150 mostly teenaged protesters sustained gun-shot
wounds. At least 10 people were reportedly in critical condition, including
a 12 years old, Murad Jamjum, whose head was hit by an Israeli sniper bullet,
causing him brain hemorrhage, and a 13 years old, Lina Rashid Misk, who
sustained a serious wound in the belly, forcing doctors to sever 40 cm.
of here impaired intestines.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian medical sources said many of the inflicted
injuries were meant to kill or cause irreversible damage, e.g. paralysis
or permanent disability. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We have seen many of the injured were hit by bullets
in the upper part of their bodies, particularly the head, the chest, and
the spinal cord,&quot; said Yousef al Sharawi, Chief Physician at the Amira
Alya hospital in Hebron.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sharawi dismissed Israeli allegation that rubber bullets
don't kill as &quot;rubbish talk.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;These bullets are quite lethal as they could pierce
into the body several inches often causing irreparable damage.&quot; Al
Sharawi cited a case of 75 years old man from Halhul who was seriously wounded
in the latest clashes and remained in critical condition at al Ahli hospital.
he said a rubber bullet penetrated the elderly man's head, destroying some
of the vital blood vessels. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">Deep Frustration</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian protests in Hebron were ostensibly sparked
off by U.S. House of Representatives' decision to recognize Jerusalem as
&quot;Israel's united and undivided capital.&quot; Indeed, the American
decision drew indignant reactions from most Palestinians and was viewed
as another proof, if proof was needed, of flagrant American hostility to
Arab and Muslim causes.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Never the less, the underlying reason behind the current
wave of unrest sees to have more to do with the dying or already-dead peace
process than with the American decision. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Observers note that most Palestinians have come to feel
cheated and betrayed by a peace process that further narrowed their horizons
and made them ever more vulnerable to Israeli insolence and hegemony. Manifestations
of the Palestinians' collective ordeal are everywhere. Settlements are creeping
in all directions, closing in on Palestinian towns, villages and hamlets
turning them into &quot;shutt-in ghettoes&quot; deprived of any prospects
of future growth or demographic expansion. The Judaization of Jerusalem,
meanwhile, is continued on a frenzied pace, and concerted efforts are being
made to achieve demographic &quot;Jewish&quot; continuity between the holy
city and Jericho, thus cutting off the West Bank into two halves.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">For its part, Yaser Arafat's Palestinian Authority seems
to be completely naked, powerless, and demoralized. To illustrate its dismal
state of affair, some PA officials are beginning to speak of reverting to
the status-quo ante, a return to the direct Israeli occupation of Palestinian
towns now under exclusive PA control.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last week, a leading Fateh leader in the West Bank, Abbas
Zaki, recognized that &quot;the boat could be rocked altogether in the occupied
territories.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Speaking at the PA Ministry of Information office in Hebron
on 19 June, Zaki pointed out that the Palestinian people are increasingly
fed up with the peace process and with what he called PA's &quot;futile
treatment of the current crisis.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This situation can't be sustained for much longer.
Either we advance forward or return to confrontation, and should we be forced
to revert to violence, it wouldn't be confined to us; there would be a regional
conflagration with unpredictable ramifications.&quot;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">Anger in Nablus</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Zaki's predictions don't seem to be far fetched. On 21
June, as many as 10.000 townspeople took to the streets to protest the House
of Representatives decision on Jerusalem and America's sinister alliance
with the Zionist entity. The huge mass of humanity shouted in unison &quot;with
soul and blood, we shall protect Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;we are willing
to die so that Jerusalem may live.&quot; The rally, the first joint Islamist-nationalist
endeavor of its kind, was addressed by several speakers, representing Hamas,
the PA, Fateh and leftist groups. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Jewish groups plan to take over al Masjidul
Aksa</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem - PT (21 June)</font></b><font SIZE="+1">:</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Several messianic Jewish groups have been performing specific
rituals in advance of the &quot;re-establishment of the Third Holy Temple&quot;
at the site of al Masjidul Aksa in Jerusalem, Israeli sources revealed on
Friday.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to the Hebrew daily, Ha'aretz, the leader of
one of these groups, Yehuda Itzioni, has been active organizing &quot;exercises
and rehearsals&quot; on slaughtering sacrificial animals in preparation
for the &quot;rebuilding of the Holy Temple following the erasure of the
Al Aksa Mosque.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In 1980, Itzioni was involved in a conspiracy to blow up
the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aksa Mosque along with several other terrorists
belonging to what was then labeled &quot;the Jewish Underground.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, all the terrorists were given presidential pardon
and subsequently released, only to resume their diabolical plans against
Islam's third holiest shrine.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Ha'aretz pointed out that Itzioni and hundreds of his followers
slaughtered a ram recently at the Jewish settlement of Karmi Tsur in the
Hebron area.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The ram was reportedly cut off into several pieces following
an ancient tradition attributed to custodians of the Temple's altar when
making their sacrificial offerings to the deity.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The rituals were filmed by the Canadian Television station
(CTV) as part of a documentary on &quot;Extremist Jewish Religious trends
in Israel.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to &quot;Ha'aretz&quot; the rituals lasted for
three hours, without the slightest interference by the police.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The film included an interview with Itzioni during which
he told CTV correspondent in Israel Diana Lewis that &quot;the Aksa Mosque
is the wrong building in the right place.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Itzioni added that &quot;my followers are growing in number
on a daily bases, and that a large movement is now being crystallized around
the idea of the Jewish right in rebuilding the Temple.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A member of the group, who introduced herself as Banina,
said she believed that an imminent war would take place after which the
al Aksa Mosque would be erased and the temple rebuilt.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Indeed, most of the Jewish groups associated with Religious
Zionism believe that an internecine war on unheard-of scales (e.g. one that
would leave tens of millions of casualties) is a necessary precondition
for the coming of the Mashiah who would save the Jewish people and bring
about global Jewish domination or Redemption.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In 1980, a Jewish Underground member who was implicated
in planting bombs in the vicinity of al Masjidul Aksa told Israeli interrogators
that he thought the would-be-demolition of the Mosque would have infuriated
hundreds of millions of Muslims the world over.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The terrorist added that he reasoned Muslim rage would
lead to a war which in all likelihood would escalate into a world war in
which the scale of casualties would be formidable enough to promote the
process of Redemption of the Jews and of the Land of Israel. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">As all Muslims would by then disappear, everything would
be ready for the coming of the Messia.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In March, a group of rabbis became euphoric following their
success in producing a &quot;completely red heifer&quot; at the Kfar Hasideem
settlement, the first of its kind in three thousand years.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The rabbis, some of whom were seen examining the heifer
skin using magnifying lenses, announced that the ashes of the cow, when
immolated, would bring about the perfect purification of the sages, which
then would herald the rebuilding of the Temple Mount.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">Not anecdotal</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">It is imperative to stress that these dangerous eschatological
ideas are by no means anecdotal in nature or confined to a small group of
eccentric believers. In fact they par excellence formulate both the very
ideology of many hundreds of thousands of Israelis, including most settlers,
followers of the National Religious Party (Mifdal), Gush Emunim, Kach, Kahane
Hay, and perceivably, the gate-keepers of Israel's huge nuclear arsenal.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In light, the world, particularly Muslims, should not be
surprised if they wake up one day to the grim news of al Aksa Mosque's destruction
at the hands of those dangerous terrorists who pose an unparalleled menace
to world peace.</font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem (18 June):</font></b><font SIZE="+1">
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Conditions at the Meggido detention camp near Jenin, where
nearly 600 Palestinians are detained by Israel as &quot;hostages,&quot;
have reached the explosion point, a report issued by the Jerusalem-based
Prisoner Club revealed on Wednesday.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The report disclosed that Israeli &quot;Special Forces&quot;
stormed the detention camp several times in the last few weeks, severely
beating up detainees who were protesting draconian Israeli measures at the
camp.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to the report, which was published in leading
Arabic newspapers in the territories, scores of prisoners and the so-called
&quot;administrative detainees&quot; were either injured or suffered from
gas suffocation during the storming of the camp by an IDF crack unit.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli troops reportedly raided the camp at least three
times in the last three months, with the most violent and savage attack
taking place on 19 March, resulting in as many as 20 injuries among the
detainees.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to information smuggled from the maximum-security
camp, Israeli soldiers in full combat gear stormed detainees tents, beating
them &quot;in bestial manner,&quot; and putting their clothes and belongings
on fire.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Israeli soldiers equipped with gas masks threw
as many as 50 gas bombs throughout the camp, causing asphyxiation to many
detainees. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Five detainees reportedly fainted, and one, who apparently
had cardiac problems, collapsed unconscious consequently..</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Prisoner Club report blamed the Palestinian Authority
for not paying sufficient attention to the detainees cause.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We, once again, appeal to President Yasser Arafat
to take immediate action to save our brothers from the claws of Israeli
savagery and barbarism,&quot; said the report.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The report pointed out that Israeli army sought to conceal
its &quot;genocidal and disgraceful practices against the defenseless detainees
by cutting off the camp from the outside world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Tuesday, 17 June, the Israeli Prison Authority, issued
a statement, admitting that conditions at the Meggido were not &quot;idealistic.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The statement said that hundreds of administrative detainees
(held without charge or trial) were being transferred to other prisons.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meggido Prison Chief Nera'am Gold-Brom told the Hebrew
daily &quot;Ha'aretz&quot; on 17 June that &quot;sub-standard conditions
contributed to disturbances and the death of several inmates at the camp.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Gold-Brom also revealed that 592 detainees were being detained
at Meggido, 66% of them are affiliated with the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and the rest associated with Fatah and other secular Palestinian
movements. <br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Hamas receives lion's share of student vote
in Jerusalem</font></h3>

<p><b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (17 June): </font></i></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) achieved a big
victory in Mondays student election at al Quds University, winning 31 seats
or 61% of the 51 contested seats which make up the student general assembly
at the college.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Four student blocs participated in the election, including
&quot;al Quds al Muslima&quot; (Islamic Jerusalem), the pro-Fatah Shabiba,
the leftist Action Front, and the moderate Islamic Independence bloc.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to results announced Monday night, al Quds al
Muslima, a coalition of Hamas and Islamic Jihad supporters, won 31 seats,
followed by its chief rival, the Shabiba bloc, which won 16 seats. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The remaining three seats went to the leftists.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Dr. Ali Khashan, who supervised the election,
70% of the student body at the college cast their ballot. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hamas achieved remarkable victories this year at universities
and institutes of higher learning within the autonomous enclaves, which
observers say reflects growing public disenchantment with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority and the peace process as a whole.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, many more Palestinians have come to lose confidence
in the integrity of the PA following the disclosure two months ago that
hundreds of millions of dollars of public money had been embezzled by high-ranking
PA officials.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Monday, 16 June, a public opinion poll in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip revealed that 52% of the Palestinian people thought the
PA ministerial board had outlived its usefulness and should, therefore,
resign immediately.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, the survey, which was conducted between 5-7 June
using a randomly-chosen sample of 1317 respondents, showed that a 63 % of
the Palestinians believed that corruption was rampant PA administrative
hierarchy.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In the Gaza Strip, where the PA is believed to be stronger,
a staggering 74% of the respondents said corruption was increasing.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The survey was conducted by the Nablus-based Research Center,
which is reportedly financed, at least partially, by the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Israeli soldiers follow &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot;
pattern in Hebron</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Hebron- PT (17 June)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Confrontations between heavily armed Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian protesters continued for the fourth consecutive day in downtown
Hebron, resulting in scores of injuries among the defenseless Palestinians.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">At least twenty Palestinians, including several children,
were hit by bullets. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to hospital sources three of the injured received
serious gunshot wounds and were until Tuesday evening in critical condition.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A 12-year-old child, Murad Jamjum, sustained a direct hit
in the head, causing him severe brain hemorrhage.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Murad has not regained consciousness and is repeatedly
in deep coma.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A 76-year Halhul man was also injured seriously after he
was hit by a random bullet apparently fired by an Israeli sniper.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian sources said the weak old man was stepping
out of a local clinic when crack Israeli soldiers pelted his frail body
with rubber bullets, nearly killing him.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Palestinian sources, Israeli soldiers adopted
a shoot-to-kill pattern with Palestinian protesters, as most of Tuesday's
injuries were in the upper part of the body.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Observers opined that the ongoing Hebron clashes could
spread over the rest of the autonomous enclave, given the widespread frustration
and indignation in the Palestinian community.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In the meanwhile, trigger-happy Israeli settlers sought
to remove a barbed-wire fence outside their settlement near Jericho for
the purpose of seizing land owned by Palestinian farmers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A number of Palestinian officials arrived at the scene,
including Preventive Security Chief Jebril Rajoub and Dr. Saeb Irekat. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Irekat said he was sure that Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu gave a green light to the settlers to go wild in order to completely
bury the peace process.<br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Conversion bill may endanger Israeli government</font></h3>

<p><b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem -PT (16 June):</font></i></b><font SIZE="+1"> A brewing controversy in Israel over &quot;who is a Jew&quot;
may endanger the very survival of the Israeli government, Israeli sources
said on Monday, 16 June. The controversy is centred around a proposed draft
law that would recognize as legitimate those conversions to Judaism performed
by Reformist and Conservative Rabbis, which has been vehemently opposed
by the influential Orthodox Rabbinate as well as most religious and ultra-religious
political parties in Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Sunday, 15 June, leaders of the Reformist and Conservative
sects met extensively with Israeli politicians from across the political
and religious spectrum, including Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, in
an effort to expedite the passing of the conversion bill to rectify the
erstwhile inferior religious status of those affected individuals in Israel.
While Netanyahu refused to appear as siding with the &quot;heretic&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Reformists and Conservatives, he nevertheless reportedly
promised to see to it that a compromise acceptable to &quot;all parties&quot;
be worked out.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Earlier, Israeli Trade and Industry Minister, Natan Sharansky
(currently facing charges of connections with the powerful Russian mafia)
vowed to quit the government if the conversion bill was not passed. Netanyahu
met with Sharansky on 16 June in an attempt to resolve the matter, but reportedly
to no avail. Sharansky had argued that failure to pass the bill would cause
a spilt between Israel and the world, especially American Jews, the bulk
of whom are affiliated with the Reformist and Conservative sects.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Reformist leaders, Netanyahu is seeking to
produce an &quot;impossible formula&quot; whereby conversions by non-Orthodox
Rabbis would be recognized as legitimate while at the same time enable the
Orthodox establishment to retain its veto power over the conversion issue.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Reuven Hammer, head of the Rabbinical Assembly
of Israel, the Netanyahu government would work out a formula by which Reformist
and Conservative converts can be registered as Jews, but would, at the same
time, give the Orthodox camp the feeling that these people were not exactly
registered as Jews.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">During the second week of June, hostilities between the
Orthodox and the non-Orthodox camps developed into a near show-down when
ultra-religious activists spat on and shouted &quot;Nazis&quot; at a group
of Reformist and Conservative Jews who were praying at the Wailing Wall
in East Jerusalem. Eventually, the non-Orthodox Jews were forced to flee
the site after police failed to protect the group from the wrath of Orthodox
hoodlums who hurled stones at the &quot;heretics&quot; as well as &quot;Goyem&quot;
Arabs nearby.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The incident, not unprecedented, was half-heartedly condemned
by Israeli officials. Premier Netanyahu described it as &quot;terrible&quot;
but refused to denounce the perpetrators and their supporters.<br>

Arrested </font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Al Khalil (Hebron)- PT (14 June)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Clashes between stone-hurling Palestinian activists and
Israeli occupation soldiers resumed Saturday in Hebron, breaking an uneasy
calm that lasted for several weeks.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The clashes occurred at the Bab el Zawiaya commercial district
after Palestinian activists pelted a settler building with stones in response
to settler provocations.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Earlier, Palestinian sources accused settlers of throwing
rubbish and garbage on Palestinian street-goers near Beith Hadasa, a settler
building bordering area &quot;A&quot; which is controlled by the Palestinian
Authority.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli soldiers sought to disperse Palestinian demonstrators,
using rubber bullets, tear gas, and stun grenades, injuring as many seven
Palestinians.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">A spokesman for the Princess Alya hospital in downtown
Hebron said at least five people were brought in to the hospital. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The spokesman said the injured suffered from gas inhalation
and rubber bullet wounds in various parts of their bodies.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">PA policemen were deployed to the area in an effort to
separate between the demonstrators and Israeli soldiers and settlers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The new clashes occurred amid rising tension in much of
the occupied territories following the ostensible failure of Egyptian mediation
efforts to revive the deadlocked peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli
track, and the American Congress decision to recognize Jerusalem as &quot;Israel's
united capital.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Elsewhere in the West Bank, the Israeli occupation army
imposed a draconian curfew on several villages in the vicinity of Ramallah.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">An Israeli army spokesman said six Palestinians from the
village of Ein Yabrud 10 miles south West of Ramallah were arrested on suspicion
of having connections with an armed attack on an Israeli settler car 5 miles
west of Jerusalem Friday night.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The settler sustained serious to moderate gun-shot wounds,
having been hit by bullets from an automatic weapon.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The incident took place in areas occupied in 1948. No Palestinian
organization took responsibility for the attack. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Palestinians Castigate Congress Decision</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- PT (14 JUNE)</font></b><font SIZE="+1">
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The recent U.S. Congress decision to recognize Jerusalem
as &quot;Israel's united and undivided capital&quot; has drawn indignant
reactions from Palestinians on all levels in the occupied territories and
in pre-1967 Palestine.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Friday, the Juma'a speaker at al Masjidul Aksa (Aksa
Mosque) launched a vitriolic attack on the Congress decision, describing
it as &quot;provocative, obscene and diabolical.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This sinister decision is a new proof, if proof is
needed, of the contempt with which the United States treats the Arab-Muslim
world, masses and regimes.&quot; said the speaker.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, he blamed Arab and Muslim leaders and peoples
for giving &quot;this Satanic force&quot; sufficient reason &quot;to treat
us lightly and not to take us seriously.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We have only ourselves to blame because we willingly
accepted to be subservient to the Americans in ways resembling the subservience
of the tail to the body,&quot; said the speaker, alluding to the close ties
between the United States and many Arab regimes.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In Hebron, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub, argued that al Quds (Jerusalem)
represents the heart of the Muslim Umma (nation) &quot;and its conscience,
its dignity, present and future; adding that should the Umma, God forbids,
continue to allow Israel to retain Jerusalem, then death would be better
than life for Muslims.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Rajoub, an eloquent and quotable preacher in the Hebron
area, pointed out, however, that the United States wouldn't have dared embarked
on such &quot;insult to the Muslim world,&quot; had not been for Arab subservience
to the White House.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Rajoub turned on the Palestinian Authority, saying that
it is time this &quot;absurd show of the peace process is terminated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Haven't you realized by now that the peace process
is a sheer illusion and the so called sole sponsor of the process is a viscous
enemy of Muslims,&quot; Rajoub said before several thousand worshipers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">For its part, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, strongly
condemned the Congress decision, saying it represented a new provocation
against Muslims the world over.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, the Islamist movement warned American decision-makers
that Muslims would keep silent indefinitely in the face of American insolence
and hegemony.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;Jerusalem, East and West, and the whole of Palestine
is Muslim. The American decision is therefore null and void as far Muslims
are concerned.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Condemnation of the Congress decision also came form Muslim
leaders in Israel. Sheikh Raed Salah, Mayor of Um Al Fahem, sent a telegram
to U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Endyk, expressing total rejection of
the decision.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Salah described the decision as amounting to &quot;
a declaration of war against the Muslim Umma.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Congress decision on Jerusalem coincided with the near
collapse of the peace process and with determined Israeli efforts to impose
the &quot;fait accompli&quot; on the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hence, it would be reasonably safe to expect tense and
potentially violent days and weeks ahead.</font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- PT (11 June)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinian Authority health officials declared a state
of emergency throughout the autonomous enclaves Wednesday in an effort to
combat an acute outbreak of meningitis in the Gaza Strip and parts of the
West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Riyad al Zanoun, who holds the health portfolio in the
PA, revealed in a press conference on 11 June that as many as 350 cases
of &quot;meningitis&quot; were hospitalized in the Gaza Strip during the
last few days.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Meningitis occurs as a result of an inflammation of the
meningitis, the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">AL Zanoun said 150 cases were treated and released after
full recovery, while as many as 200 cases remained in hospitals for further
treatment.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Palestinian official exhorted the public not to panic,
stressing that the disease was mostly of the relatively benign viral kind,
not the more serious bacterial, although a few cases of the latter category
were diagnosed in the strip.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">He called on the public to thoroughly wash and rinse fruits
and vegetables and not to drink contaminated water.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Many Palestinian physicians voiced increasing pessimism
at the deteriorating state of public health within the some of the autonomous
enclaves. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Dr. Ghazi Ikteit, a general practitioner in Dura (about
12 miles south-West of Hebron) disclosed that he had been receiving scores
of children of late suffering from various kinds of infections in their
digestive systems. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Ikteit opined that the infections were in the most part
the result of drinking contaminated water.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Dura, a town of 25,000, reportedly has been having an acute
water shortage this summer, forcing townspeople to fetch water from exposed
and antiquated wells dating back to the Ottoman era. Dura mayor, Mahmud
al Nammura, admitted that the municipal council was completely powerless
to solve the problem.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The Israelis are stealing our water, and the Palestinian
Authority can't help us, hence we are going thirsty, this is the problem,&quot;
muttered al Nammura with a tone of frustration and hopelessness.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">ON JABAL ABU GHNEIM</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT ( 9 June) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israel and the Palestinian Authority may be about to reach
&quot; a tacit understanding&quot; whereby Israel would continue settlement
activities at Jabal Abu Ghneim but at &quot;a much reduced pace&quot; in
return for a full resumption of Palestinian-Israeli talks, Israeli sources
said on Monday.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Anonymous Israeli officials were quoted as saying on Monday
the &quot;brewing deal&quot; stipulates that Israel reduces to a bare minimum
settlement activities at Jabal Abu Ghneim in such a manner that would enable
the Israeli government to claim that the building didn't stop while enabling
the Palestinians to claim that they were able to extract from Israel a &quot;virtual&quot;
stoppage of settlement-building in East Jerusalem.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">It is not clear how the Egyptians will be able to come
up with an &quot;impossible formula&quot; as such, and whether they would
be able to sell it to the two sides, particularly the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, observers here believe Egyptian mediator Osama
al Baz would try to strike &quot;a tacit understanding&quot; rather than
&quot; a formal agreement&quot; between Israel and the Palestinian Authority
which would allow for the resumption of the stalled talks.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The rumored Egyptian stance, viewed with suspicion by the
Palestinians and unusually welcomed by Israel, would amount to a backdown
on the declared Palestinian position on Israeli settlement policy.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Indeed, the very fact that Arafat agreed to resume &quot;contacts&quot;
with Israel without prior conditions demonstrated that he &quot;blinked
first.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Earlier, Palestinian officials intimated that the Egyptian
leadership, particularly al Baz, cajoled Arafat into dropping his demand
that &quot;an absolute and complete halt to settlement building&quot; be
reached before the resumption of talks.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Egyptian pressure on the Palestinians was lauded by
Israeli officials who described it as &quot;very positive.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The usually hawkish minister of Justice, Tzahi Hanegbi,
uncharacteristically praised &quot;Egyptian mediation efforts,&quot; opining
that the Egyptians &quot;were becoming more equitable and more moderate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hanegbi, who is avowedly anti-Arab since his college years
at the Hebrew University, said during a radio interview with Cal Yisrael
on 9 June that Egyptian efforts were making a constructive contribution.<br>

THE </font></h3>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">SACKING OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem-PT (7 June) </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Lawyers, Judges, and human rights activists as well as
many ordinary Palestinians heaved a sigh of relief following the sacking
by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on Friday 6 June of the
widely despised Attorney-General Khalid al Qedreh.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Arafat fired al Qedreh reportedly after the 70-years old
had &quot;outlived his usefulness&quot; and become an &quot;intolerable
liability,&quot; in the words of a PA ministry of justice official who asked
for anonymity.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;The man became like an inseparable stigma attached
to the judicial system of the Palestinian Authority. He had to be removed,&quot;
intimated the same official.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On 6 June, the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens'
Rights issued a statement expressing profound satisfaction at the sacking
of al Qedreh.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The statement, captioned &quot;Victory for Justice,&quot;
said the &quot;presence of this man in the crucial post of the Attorney-General
did an incalculable disservice to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian
people at large.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;He always twisted the arm of the law, violated the
letter and spirit of the law, made undue interference in court proceedings,
concocted charges against innocent people, and, not the least, ignored and
even defended human rights violations by PA security agencies. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;All this,&quot; the statement went on, &quot;made
him a premier obstacle impeding the administration of justice.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Qedreh, a veteran Fatah activist who came to be hated
by the movement's younger members for his &quot;excessive hypocrisy and
sycophancy&quot; is particularly blamed for the deterioration of Press freedom
and expression within the PA enclaves.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In 1995, he ordered the closure of the pro-Hamas weekly
&quot;al Watan&quot; and its sister, al Istiklal, which was published by
the Islamic Jihad organization. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In both cases, al Qedreh accused the two papers of &quot;incitement&quot;
and &quot;endangering paramount Palestinian national interests.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Such vague charges were often evoked by al Qedreh to justify
and repress the detention without charge or trial of journalists, writers
and human rights activists.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;I never felt that he ever tried to uphold the law,&quot;
said Ghazi Hamed, Editor of the Gaza-based Islamist weekly, al Risala.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Al Qedreh was also unpopular within Fatah.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">During the Intifada, he was shot in the leg by a disgruntled
Fatah activist following wide-spread rumors that he embezzled large sums
of money destined to young intifada activists. He has not fully recuperated
from that injury.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Other critics opine that al Qedreh did only what his ultimate
boss, Yasser Arafat, told him to do.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;His main duty was to appease and please Arafat, and,
paradoxically, he ended up hurting and harming Arafat,&quot; said a clerk
at Gaza municipal council who expressed satisfaction at al Qedreh's dismissal.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">For his part, al Qedreh denied that he was sacked by Arafat,
arguing that he submitted his resignation to Chairman Arafat for reasons
having to do with his deteriorating health.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, whether al Qedreh resigned or made to resign,
his disappearance from the Attorney-General Office is a cause for relief
among most Palestinians. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">ISRAELI LABOUR PARTY ELECTS EHUD BARAK AS
NEW LEADER</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- (5 June) by Khalid Amayreh: </font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">As had been widely expected, the former Chief of Staff
of the Israeli army, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, was elected on 3 June as the
new leader of the opposition labour party.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Barak achieved a resounding victory, receiving 51% of the
total labour vote compared to 28 per cent of for his closest rival, Yossi
Beilin, a relatively dovish figure supporting the Oslo peace process. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The other two contenders for Chairman of the Party, Prof.
Shlomo Ben Amy and Knesset member Iphraim Sneh, received 14% and 6% of the
vote respectively. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Following his victory, Barak promised to &quot;rearrange
our house&quot; in order to be able to bring down the government of Prime
Minister Benyamin Netanyahu which he called &quot;a failure..&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Israel's former top soldier also promised to
regain lost confidence with Arab leaders, and to continue the peace process
with the Palestinians.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to observers, Barak's resounding victory was
largely possible due to his military credentials and the fact that he is
viewed as &quot;a spiritual son of Yitzhak Rabin.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Indeed, many Labour Party leaders, including dovish figures
such as Uzi Bara'am, adopted the idea that only &quot;a Mr. Security&quot;
like Barak could beat Benyamin Netanyahu in the next Israeli general election.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Hence, Bara'am and camp, stood behind Barak, not so much
because they are infatuated with his ideas but rather because he offered
the best possible chances for a Labour return to power in Israel. Bara'am
headed Barak's election team. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font SIZE="+1">TWEEDLEDUM AND TWEEDLEDEE</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Barak will likely present himself as a warrior-turned peacemaker
following the example of assassinated Rabin. However, many people in Israel,
including some influential labor party members who know him closely, contend
he is a mere replica of Netanyahu.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Critics point out that, like Netanyahu, Barak opposed the
Hebron redeployment agreement because he believed it didn't provide sufficient
security guarantees for the small Jewish enclave in the city.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, he opposed expanding Palestinian Authority to
the rural areas of the West Bank because he believed it would undermine
Israel's vital security interests.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">More to the point, Barak holds more or less similar, if
not identical, ideas to those held by premier Netanyahu on such final status
issues as Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, and the refugees.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Jerusalem, Barak believes Islam's third holiest site
must remain &quot;Israel's united and undivided capital,&quot; and advocates
the intensification of Jewish settlement-building in East Jerusalem.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The new Labor Party chairman also believes Israel should
annex all major settlements in the West Bank and keep the Jordan valley
under effective Israeli control.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Concerning the refugees, Barak, and all other labor Party
leaders for that matter, adopt the &quot;alternative homeland&quot; concept,
which says Palestinian refugees ought to be resettled in the Arab world,
preferably in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Barak, never the less, remains novice politician. He actually
alluded to this fact when he asked his supporters to give him a chance,
arguing that he was only 4 years old when his predecessor Shimon Peres began
his political career more than fifty years ago.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">ISRAEL TO TAKE MEASURES AGAINST PA FOLLOWING</font></h3>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">KILLING OF THREE &quot;LAND TRAITORS.&quot;</font></h3>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- PT (2 /6 / 1997)</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The killing in the West Bank recently of three land dealers
who were involved in selling Arab land to Jewish settlers has apparently
overshadowed and could undermine Egyptian efforts to resume the stalled
talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Monday, 2 June, the Israeli government reiterated earlier
charges that the PA planned and executed the killing of the three Israeli
agents.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Following a discussion of the issue by Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu and political and security aides, an Israeli officials said &quot;certain
punitive measures (against the PA) have been decided.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The official, Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahlani,
refused to spell out the nature of the measures taken, but said that Israel
&quot;could not ignore the murder of innocent people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, pundits here believe Israeli sanctions against
the PA might include restricting the movement of PA political and especially
security officials outside the autonomous enclaves or area (A) which is
under exclusive PA control.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Moreover, Israel may well embark on imposing an intermittent
or open-ended closure on Ramallah to which the three land dealers were abducted
and where they were subsequently killed. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israel actually took the draconian measure last year following
the Palestinian mini-intifada which erupted after the Netanyahu government
decided to open a subterranean tunnel beneath the Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israel may also demand the extradition of Col. Tawfik al
Tirawi who is widely accused by Israeli intelligence officials of masterminding
the killings.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In the meanwhile, the Israeli General Security Services
(the Shabak) contacted all &quot;vulnerable land dealers&quot; Sunday night,
urging them &quot;to be careful.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israel's police chief, Assaf Efets, said he received a
confidential list containing all the names of land dealers sought after
by the PA.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Efets didn't say how he obtained the list. However, observers
opine that Efets likely got the list from the Shabak, given the fact that
most land dealers are actually Shabak agents.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">For its part, the PA, which doesn't seek to conceal its
satisfaction with the liquidation of &quot;land traitors,&quot; moved to,
though belatedly, to counter the Israeli propaganda blitz.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Freih Abu Maddin, who holds the Justice portfolio in the
PA administration, Israeli charges that the PA was involved in the killing
of the collaborators as &quot;utterly mendacious, silly, and politically
motivated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Speaking during a radio interview Monday morning, Abu Maddin
said the Palestinian authority had nothing to do with the killings.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">He accused the Israeli External Intelligence, the Mossad,
or the Shabak, of liquidating the collaborators.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;This is often done by the Israelis, when collaborators
finish their job and become a burden, they destroy them, &quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The liquidation of land dealers, as it is dubbed throughout
the occupied territories, is received with profound satisfaction by most
Palestinians.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We are actually faced with a dilemma in relation
to those land dealers. Either we get rid of them, or allow them to kill
our present and future in return for a few dollars from Jewish settlers,&quot;
said Sheikh Ahmed Amre, and Islamic activist from the Hebron area.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;You know, if we allowed land dealers to have their
way, God forbid, there would be no place left for us in Palestine in a few
decades,&quot; he added with marked determination .</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Furthermore, Palestinians scoffed at concerns voiced by
the Israeli government over human rights.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;It is like Hitler lecturing us on the sanctity of
human life,&quot; one Palestinian teacher said in apparent reference to
Israeli hypocrisy. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">ISRAEL BLAMES PA FOR LAND DEALER'S DEATH</font></h3>

<p><b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem: by Khalid Amayreh (1 / 6 / 1997)
</font></i></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israel today accused the Palestinian authority of responsibility
for the killing on Saturday of a suspected land dealer on the southern outskirts
of Ramallah.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Avigdor Kahlani, the Israeli Internal Security Minister,
said today at a press conference that he had no doubts that Palestinian
Authority agents carried out &quot;the murder&quot; of Muhammed Ali Jamhour.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Jamhour's body was found on a side road south of Ramallah,
with his body riddled with bullets.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Kahlani said all clues and circumstantial evidence point
a finger of accusation toward the PA which he accused of openly encouraging
the liquidation of land dealers suspected of selling Palestinian land to
settler organizations on the West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Obviously worried that the killing of land dealers has
assumed phenomenal proportions, Kahalani warned &quot;vulnerable persons&quot;
against going to areas under PA control.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;If I were a land dealer, I would be more careful,&quot;
he said</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Saturday night, Shai Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman,
was quoted on Israel Radio as saying that &quot;land dealers are being murdered
with the open encouragement of senior figures in the Palestinian Authority,&quot;
adding that this &quot;raises a question mark over the authority's readiness
to maintain peaceful relations with Israel.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">In addition to Jamhour, two other land dealers were killed
of late, Farid Bashiti and Rebhi Abu Sara.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On Sunday morning, a previously-unknown group calling itself
&quot;Holy Land Guardians&quot; claimed responsibility for &quot;the liquidation
of land collaborators.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">An anonymous caller told the Ramallah-based daily, al Hayatul
Jadida, the Holy Land Guardians would see to it that all land dealers working
for the Israeli intelligence are killed.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Recently, the Mufti of Palestine, Sheikh Ikrema Sabri,
issue a Fatwa or Islamic theological ruling, considering land dealers apostates
outside the bounds of the Muslim Umma.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Apostates are treated as disbelieves, hence they are boycotted
by all Muslims for their treachery, and upon death, they are not given Muslim
burial nor are they allowed to be buried in Muslim cemeteries.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sabri's edict was supported by the Sheikh of Al Azhar in
Egypt, who Muslims who sell their land to Zionists interests in Palestine
committed a grand perfidy against, Allah, His messenger and the community
of Muslims.</font></p>
