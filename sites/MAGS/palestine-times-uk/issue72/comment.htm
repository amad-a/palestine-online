<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>MIDDLE EAST PEACE DESPAIR</FONT></H3>

<P>	<FONT SIZE=+1>The so-called peace deal signed on the White House lawn
in 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization has finally
broken down. The latest proof of this failure can be seen by Palestinian
Chairman Yasser Arafat's refusal to meet with  U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross
on the eve of his return to Washington.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	There are several reasons for the failure of the Peace
Accords.  Naturally, if America did not provide Israel with a constant supply
of arms and money as well as political support, things might be quite different.
Also, Arab disunity and the personal selfish greed of many Arab leaders
makes them ineffective in playing any promising role of counteracting Israeli
intransigence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Clinton's Administration is the most pro-Israeli one so
far in U.S. history.  It seems many of the positions of power in the U.S.
government are encumbered by Jews and/or Zionists who endorse further Israeli
transgressions.  There is also blatant consistency in the shameless yet
inevitable double standards that the American government adopts in regard
to affairs in the Middle Eastern  region especially where Israel is concerned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is the American backing that gives the monster it created,
Israel, the gall to insist on the building of new Jewish settlements on
the ever-decreasing Palestinian land.   Indeed, Israelis vow that their
nation will one day envelop the whole of &quot;biblical&quot; Israel.  And
with Netanyahu's insistence to continue building Jewish settlements on 60%
of what is left of Palestinian land, even though many of the new buildings
are to be unoccupied, it is little wonder that the peace in the region is
more distant than ever.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is no secret either that one of the main reasons the
U.S. backs  whatever Israel does without question is because of the strong
Jewish lobby within the U.S. government.  It is no wonder that no U.S. President
has ever been anti-Israel!  To be so would mean certain death or at the
very least kissing the American presidency good-bye.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Even though the latest Israeli spy scandal, involving
a senior American official who had passed on sensitive information to the
Israeli government, was of great embarrassment to the Clinton Administration,
it is unlikely that the scandal will be used to pressure Tel Aviv into freezing
the construction in the Abu Ghneim settlement near Arab East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In order for the Peace Process to thrive, the PA demands
that Israel order a halt to the building of the Abu Ghneim settlement. 
In spite of the fact that Israeli President Ezer Weizman cut off ties with
Prime Minister Netanyahu because of his attitude towards the peace-making
stalemate, Netanyahu said that he was proud of his decision to build the
6,500-unit settlement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Palestinians are victims of a cruel and ruthless oppression
that denies them the basic rights entitled to all human beings.  They are
worse off than the black population during the apartheid in South Africa
since not only are they being segregated and discriminated against, they
are also being systematically forced off what is left of their lawful land
by inhuman methods.  The saddest part of the whole Peace Process is that
Palestinians are no better off than they were before the peace initiatives
and that they continue to lose what is rightfully theirs in the first place.<BR>
