</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">As U.S. special envoy Dennis
B. Ross toiled Wednesday at what  increasingly seemed a fruitless
mission, the ugly, sour mood that has  come to characterize relations
between Israel and the Arab world was on  stark display.<BR>
In Cairo, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, Israel's
 erstwhile peace partner, reiterated that he plans to declare
an  independent Palestinian state next spring--with or without
an agreement  with Israel--and said he expects Israel to try to
retake areas under his  control.<BR>
In the West Bank, Fatah, Arafat's political faction, bitterly
 attacked Ross for the lack of progress in peace talks. In a statement
in  the semiofficial Al Hayat newspaper, Fatah described Ross,
who is  Jewish, as a &quot;Shylock,&quot; a representative of
the &quot;Zionist lobby&quot; and an  ineffective mediator. Shylock,
a miserly Jewish character in  Shakespeare's &quot;Merchant of
Venice,&quot; is considered an expression of  anti-Semitism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Oasis, which opened to the public
Wednesday night, is a $50 million  venture that is majority-owned
by Austrians. There have been Israeli and  Palestinian news reports
as well that one of Palestinian leader Yasser  Arafat's chief
aides, Khaled Salam, is a large investor in the venture,  and
that other Palestinian officials helped the casino to open. Once
the  casino turns a profit, the Palestinian Authority will take
a healthy 25  percent of revenues in taxes.</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"></FONT></B></P>

that he has nothing to lose by carrying out a  big terror attack,&quot;
commented someone close to Hamas. &quot;A Hamas attack  might
heat up the atmosphere, but won't ruin anything. On the contrary,
 it might even wake the Americans up to act more forcefully. There
must  be a bombing. The credibility of Hamas is on the line. It's
sad, but  that is how it is.</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"></FONT></B></P>

</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">BEIT ULA, West Bank - Not long
before her baby stopped breathing - even  before it was born on
the way to the hospital - Fadwa Alam had a  terrifying thought:
What if the Israeli soldiers stopped her?<BR>
Impossible, she decided.<BR>
''We expected them to allow us to cross the checkpoint because
I was  pregnant and in labor,'' she said, her voice a numb, low
monotone as she  described the ordeal. ''I mean, we had no doubt
they'd let us pass. The  hospital's just 10 minutes past the checkpoint.''<BR>
To most Palestinians, Israeli roadblocks are a hassle and a humiliation,
 not a threat to life. </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><BR>

</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">JABALYA REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza -
Imagine being Ahmad Mousa, chief of  elementary schools in Gaza's
astonishingly overcrowded refugee  districts. When schools opened
last year, he had to cope with 10,000 additional  students. This
year, he must find room for 11,000 more. Next year, the  school
system is expected to grow by 12,000 pupils.<BR>
	The social and political earthquake that gave birth to contemporary
Gaza  was Israel's 1948 war of independence. Some 250,000 Palestinians
fled or  were expelled from their homes and sought refuge in Gaza.
The refugees  thought their stay would be brief - a few months,
maybe a year. But  today they remain in Gaza and, together with
their children and  grandchildren, comprise one of the world's
fastest-growing populations.</FONT></P>

</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Avraham Ladani, a Dolev settler
arrested last Thursday as a suspect in  the shooting death of
a 17-year-old Palestinian and the wounding of a  15-year-old at
an intersection in Bitunia, was released from police  custody
on New Year's Eve on NIS 5,000 bail, and sent to a Jerusalem 
youth hostel where he will remain under house arrest.<BR>
Palestinian Authority sources again demanded he be extradited
to them,  and condemned what they called Israel's &quot;revolving
door&quot; policy of  releasing settlers suspected of shooting
Palestinians.. <BR>
Palestinian sources said that the PA had sent a sharply worded
protest  to the U.S. following Ladani's release to house arrest,
complaining that  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not condemned
the shooting.</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><BR>
