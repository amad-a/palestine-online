<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Yasin's Triumphant Return to Gaza</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem - Hamas founder and spiritual mentor,
Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, received a hero&iacute;s welcome upon his arrival in
Gaza City on 6 October with thousands of supporters and well-wishers greeting
the 61-year-old wheelchair-bound Islamist leader with &igrave;ahalan wasahalan&icirc;
(welcome) and &igrave;God is great.&icirc; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin was first accorded an official welcome at Palestinian
Authority headquarters on the Gaza shore. Greeting him there were Yasser
Arafat&iacute;s personal secretary al Tayyeb Abdul Rahim, Suha Arafat (standing
in for her husband who had earlier visited the Sheikh in hospital in Amman),
and top PA political and security officials along with high-ranking Hamas
leaders from the Strip. Islamist leaders from the West Bank were not present
due to the Israeli closure on Palestinian territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After the brief official reception, Yasin was taken to
the al Yarmuk stadium where over 30,000 people were awaiting his arrival
since the morning. There, decorated flags and banners greeted Yasin as &igrave;our
great leader.&icirc; One huge green banner read &igrave;In the name of Hamas,
we welcome the Sheikh of the intifadah.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin addressed the jubilant crowd, appealing for national
unity and urging Palestinians to be strong and united.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;There is no difference between this and that or
big and small. We are all one people united in the face of occupation and
oppression,&icirc; he said in an unflinching tone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin told the cheering multitude that &igrave;the future
belongs to us because our cause is just and our people are alive and well
and will continue to be alive and well, God willing.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin sounded as defiant as ever when he said that &igrave;we
must continue to defy our oppressor and foil their efforts to disintegrate
us into shreds.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Yasin, who is physically paralyzed but mentally
alert, said Hamas was not contemplating a cease-fire or truce with Israel
as long as &igrave;the Israeli soldiers&iacute; boots are pressed against
our necks and chests.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Resistance,&icirc; he said, &igrave;is a natural
human right; I&iacute;ll fight even my own brother if he takes over my home
and arrogates my rights.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite his conciliatory tone toward the Palestinian Authority
and its chairman Yasser Arafat, Yasin nevertheless strongly criticized the
closure by the PA in Gaza last month of sixteen social, educational, and
charitable institutions associated with the Islamist movement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said &igrave;I call on the authority not to succumb
to American and Israeli pressure, and to desist from incarcerating our sons
because this is not in our interests; it is inadmissible to close civil
institutions just because the Americans and the Israelis demand that to
be done.&icirc; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin was flown directly from Amman aboard a Jordanian
Air Force helicopter following the conclusion of a hastily-made deal between
Jordan&iacute;s King Hussein and Israel whereby Israel freed Yasin and scores
of other Palestinian prisoners in return for releasing from Jordanian custody
the two Mossad agents who on 25 September attempted to assassinate in Amman
the head of the Hamas political bureau Khaled Misha&iacute;al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The release of Sheikh Ahmed Yasin and 22 other Palestinians
from Israeli detention was undoubtedly a significant morale-booster for
most Palestinians who had of late been prone to mounting frustration, given
Benyamin Netanyahu&iacute;s determined efforts to impose the fait accompli
in the West Bank and the American and international powerlessness to stop
Israeli insolence. The freedom of Yasin and scores of other Palestinian
detainees already released and slated to be released soon was after all
earned at almost no cost for the Palestinians. &igrave;It was a gift of
God,&icirc; said Hamas leader Mahmud al Zahar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, many ordinary Palestinians feel Yasin&iacute;s
words breathe inspiration and encouragement into the hearts and minds of
thousands of Palestinians who otherwise have become accustomed to seeing
Yasser Arafat repeatedly give in to Israeli dictates and blackmail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Here we have a leader who sticks to his principles
regardless of the balance of power...only a real man like Yasin can make
a real peace with Israel,&icirc; said a Hebron Islamist doctor upon seeing
Yasin&iacute;s helicopter land in Gaza.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Notwithstanding, the Palestinians&iacute; joyful reaction
to Yasin&iacute;s freedom and homecoming was fraught with some consternation
at King Hussein for concluding a deal with Israel that enabled the Jewish
state to smoothly retrieve &igrave;our big hunt,&icirc; the two Mossad agents
who had made the assassination attempt on Khaled Misha&iacute;al.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamist sources argued that had the King insisted, he
could have secured the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees from
Israeli jails in return for the &igrave;two Canadians.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They pointed out that many of the 22 prisoners released
as a result of the deal were actually Palestinian labourers who were jailed
for entering Israel without valid entry permits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nonetheless, it doesn&iacute;t seem that the dismay is
deep enough to overshadow the widespread satisfaction at Yasin&iacute;s
release and Khaled Misha&iacute;al&iacute;s safety.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;We knew from the very inception that the presence
of two Mossad agents in King Hussein&iacute;s custody is not exactly like
them being in the hands of Hamas...we didn&iacute;t expect too much from
Jordan anyway,&icirc; said a Hamas leader in Ramallah as news of the swap
spread. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is no doubt that the release of Sheikh Yasin will
strengthen Hamas, even in real terms. Observers here believe that the Sheikh&iacute;s
steadfastness (he refused all along to pledge to renounce &euml;terrorism&iacute;
in return for his release), his dignified and high-profile release from
Israeli detention, and the failed assassination attempt on Khaled Misha&iacute;al
by Mossad in Amman will all make the Movement more appealing to thousands
of erstwhile disenchanted Palestinian and Arab youths who are dead tired
of official Arab impotence vis-&brvbar;-vis Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Hamas, thanks to the latest developments, has
been able to gain renewed and badly-needed legitimacy in the region at large.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;From now on, the Hamas factor can&iacute;t be ignored,&icirc;
said Hamas Gaza leader Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi, now considered the most senior
Islamist spokesman in the occupied territories after Yasin himself. &igrave;Sheikh
Ahmed Yasin is now viewed as second among equals vis-&brvbar;-vis Yasser
Arafat,&icirc; he asserted, rather satisfactorily.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But being &igrave;second among equals&icirc; carries with
it not only promises of constructive cooperation but also undesirable prospects
of friction and discord, especially in an immature political environment
where the leader, e.g. Arafat, is not really held to serious political accountability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A free Yasin can therefore be either a helping hand for
Arafat or a real thorn in his side, depending on how the PA Chairman deals
with Benyamin Netanyahu&iacute;s policy of &igrave;take it or leave it&icirc;
towards the Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+2>Khaled Misha'al to Palestine Times:</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas has enough reasons to continue occupation
resistance</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Mahmoud Al Khatib</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The head of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) Mr. Khaled Misha'al accused the Israeli Mossad of the &quot;cowardly&quot;
assassination attempt on his life in Amman on 25 September. He added that
the attempt was a complete failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Describing the bungled attempt against him, Mr. Misha'al
said he was still not sure of the instrument used by the Mossad agents which
later caused serious health troubles for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;What happened on Thursday, 25 September was no doubt
a mean assassination attempt on my life perpetrated by the Mossad agents,
but thank God, I survived,&quot; Mr. Misha'al told the Palestine Times.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I want to emphasize that the barbaric conspiracies
made by the Zionist enemy will not weaken our will. As you see, I have recovered
completely, thank God, and my will and determination to continue on my path
have doubled after the bungled attempt,&quot; the Hamas leader said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Misha'al pointed out that he was attacked suddenly
by two Mossad agents at the entrance of the complex that contains his office
in Amman. &quot;I heard a stunning sound in my left ear and felt as if I
had been electrically shocked. In the beginning, I thought I was shot but
then I was not sure of what happened exactly until I began vomiting and
felt dizzy and lost my balance,&quot; he said. Mr. Misha'al was rushed to
the Islamic Hospital in Amman after which King Hussein ordered that he be
moved to the military King Hussein Medical City where he received treatment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A report issued by the Sunday Times on 5 October revealed
that the Mossad agents carrying fake Canadian passports sprayed a poisonous
chemical into Mr. Misha'al's ear. The report described the bungled attack
as &quot;one of the most embarrassing incidents in the history of a service
(Mossad) renowned for its ruthless efficiency.&quot; The incident &quot;infuriated
King Hussein of Jordan (the Arab country closest to Israel), led to the
withdrawal of Canada's ambassador from Tel Aviv, and prompted President
Bill Clinton to urge the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the imprisoned
leader of Hamas,&quot; the report said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu admitted that there
had been an &quot;operational failure&quot; but said the attack was essential.
Mr. Misha'al paid tribute to his bodyguard &quot;Abu Saif&quot;, who was
described by an Israeli newspaper as a &quot;real James Bond&quot;, for
running after and detaining the two Mossad agents until they were subsequently
arrested.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This hero (Abu Saif) was fasting that day. Despite
that, he chased the two agents and knocked them down before he was able
to control them and hand them to the Jordan police. In the process, one
of the two criminals attacked Abu Saif with a sharp instrument on his head
which then needed 18 stitches,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hamas leader assailed the Zionist attempt on his life
saying it was an example of the Zionist terrorism which &quot;does not target
Hamas only, but also the whole of the Palestinian people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Mr. Misha'al dismissed a call for revenge by the Hamas
military wing in response to the assassination attempt by the Israeli Mossad.
&quot;Hamas resistance is not connected to certain incidents or occasions.
Hamas originally had enough justifications and reasons to continue its legitimate
resistance, the most important of which is the removal of the Zionist occupation
and the restoration of our people's rights,&quot; said Mr. Misha'al, adding
that Hamas fights the Zionists face to face, not from the back as the Mossad
agents did with him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They wanted to silence Hamas, but its voice had already
reached the whole world. They wanted to break my will, but now I have a
doubled will,&quot; Mr. Misha'al said.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>KNOW YOUR ENEMY: Netanyahu</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By John Hartung*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 6 October a JERUSALEM POST editorial charged that Netanyahu
is &quot;characterized by impulsiveness, poor judgement and faulty decision-making.&quot;
The next day,Yoel Marcus of HA'ARETZ was less polite: &quot;It is difficult
to avoid the distressing conclusion that the state [of Israel] is headed
by a schlemiel [a fool]. The timing, the location, the performance, the
goal, the method, the humiliation -- even the bungling Inspector Clouseau
of the 'Pink Panther' could not have produced a more inept accumulation
of negative ramifications than was generated by Bibi's power of reasoning
here.&quot; In another HA'ARETZ Op-Ed column, Amir Oren imputed Netanyhu's
underlying motive for attempting to murder Khaled Misha'al: &quot;The light-minded
Netanyahu envied Yitzhak Rabin, on whose orders Fat'hi Shikaki was assassinated
in Malta, and Shimon Peres, who ordered the assassination of Yahya Ayyash
in Gaza;&quot; in other words, in addition to being a schlemiel, Netanyahu
is a schmuck [a stupid fool]. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Outside of Israel, the established press quickly followed
the Israeli lead. The plan to murder Misha'al was condemned as over-zealous
and shortsighted. On 9 October, Thomas Friedman of THE NEW YORK TIMES informed
us that &quot;Israeli leadership has more in common with Larry, Moe and
Curly [The Three Stooges] than with David Ben-Gurion, Menachem Begin and
Yitzhak Rabin,&quot; adding that &quot;Israel today is led by people who
have no clear vision and no courage.&quot; The following Sunday, Serge Schmemann
was given page one of the TIMES' influential &quot;Week In Review&quot;
to defend the use of assassination as a political weapon, noting that the
Misha'al operation was simply a misuse of a useful tool &quot;mounted in
the wrong place, at the wrong time and against the wrong target.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The most intelligent comment that received worldwide attention
came from King Hussein: &quot;I am personally unable to reach a conclusion
as to how the Israeli Prime Minister thinks. This makes me very worried.&quot;
He should be worried. Hussein is smart enough to know that Netanyahu is
far from stupid. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology does not give
degrees in architecture and business administration to schlemiels, and schmucks
do not qualify for their Ph.D in Political Science. Indeed, if Netanyahu
is stupid, Machiavelli was an idiot. Only a fool, a propagandist, or someone
who wants to fool himself, would characterize Netanyahu as stupid. So what
was he trying to do in Jordan? We may never know, but we should have enough
self-respect to reject the notion that Misha'al was targeted by Larry, Moe
and Curly. Instead, to understand Netanyahu's objectives, we should start
with the assumption that he is smart, bold, and cunning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We should also reject the notion that Netanyahu has &quot;no
clear vision.&quot; He has a very clear vision, as described by Uzi Benziman:
&quot;to annex at least 50% of the West Bank (the Jordan Valley, the old
Green Line, Gush Etzion and greater Jerusalem); to allow the Palestinian
Authority no more than the status of a quasi-state (like Puerto Rico or
Andora) without arms or an army; to continue controlling its borders and
airspace; to be able to limit its immigration and its access to Israeli
water resources; to leave most of the Israeli settlements under Israeli
sovereignty; and to continue Israeli control over both parts of Jerusalem,
while possibly granting some status to an Arab entity over the Temple Mount
mosques&quot; (parentheses not added, HA'ARETZ, 21 September). This is an
audacious objective. It is likely to require audacious actions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The immediate obstacle to creating Netanyahu's apartheid
state is the Palestinian Authority. The more difficult obstacle is public
image. Netanyahu wants to disarm and disband the PA, but how could he accomplish
such a feat? Consider the context of the Misha'al operation. For months
Netanyahu repeated a mantra -- the Palestinian Authority must act against
'terrorism'...the PA must act against Hamas. This became his answer to every
question, to every complaint. The United States was eventually persuaded,
and the PA began to arrest Hamas leaders and close Hamas institutions in
the West Bank and Gaza. But Palestinian money was still being held, settlements
were still being expanded, and Madeleine Albright was told, in effect, to
go bake cookies. What more did Netanyahu want? He wanted more, more of the
same, more PA suppression of Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now suppose the plan to kill Misha'al had worked. Suppose
he was attacked with poison by unknown assailants in Amman. He would suffer
for two days before he dies. During those two days Netanyahu does two things.
First, instead of refusing to either confirm or deny involvement -- the
official policy in all previous Israeli assassinations -- he calmly denies
that Israel was involved. He even points to the method used, announcing
that not only would Israel not attack a citizen of Jordon in Jordon, but
being a signatory to the international treaty against chemical weapons,
Israel would not use poisonous gas on anyone. Second, he forwards all Palestinian
tax money to the PA, grants permission to build an airport and seaport in
Gaza, and announces the construction of a highway connecting Gaza and the
West Bank. When asked why he made these concessions, Netanyahu would say,
as Misha'al lay dying, that he has been greatly encouraged by the Palestinian
Authority's efforts to combat terrorism. Then he could add some words about
how it is important to reward actions taken in the right direction, even
though there is much work left to be done. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Within an hour, the PA would have been denying the outrageous
charge -- suggested by the press -- that they attacked Khaled Misha'al as
part of their crackdown on Hamas. After Misha'al died, Netanyahu would deny
that the money, the airport, the seaport and the road were a reward for
killing Misha'al, adding that Israeli intelligence sources have no evidence
of Palestinian involvement in the murder of this Hamas political leader.
At that point a unique event would have occured -- the Israelis, the Americans,
Hamas and King Hussein would have agreed on something. They would all agree
that Netanyahu lied about one thing -- about his concessions not being a
reward to the PA for assassinating Misha'al. Arafat would have been disgraced
and much of the PA would have joined Hamas. The deserters would not leave
their guns behind, and the ensuing crisis would be built up by the Israeli
and American press. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Do you remember the Lavon Affair -- when Israel gave bombs
to Egyptian Jews and had them blow up American installations in Egypt, sending
notes implicating Egyptian dissidents so that the United States would turn
against Egypt in 1954? Too audacious? Remember that Israel attacked an American
ship in 1967, killing 34 American sailors and wounding 171, only to have
the American President order the return of U.S. fighter planes that were
on their way to rescue the U.S.S. Liberty. And what about the Pollard Affair?
Pollard did not get away with spying on the United States, but Israel surely
did. Does Netanyahu remember these events, and many others? Or is he too
stupid, as the mainstream press would have us believe? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A public opinion poll published on 11 October in THE NEW
YORK TIMES showed that Netanyahu had gained on Ehud Barak among Israeli
voters, and &quot;Many listeners had already noted that in radio call-in
shows, the preponderance of callers rallied behind the Mossad and Mr. Netanyahu.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Could American opinion be far behind? On 14 October Abraham
Rosenthal published an Op-Ed piece in the NEW YORK TIMES announcing that
the attempt on Misha'al's life was a noble endeavour and that people who
criticize it on moral grounds are hypocrites. So the plan to increase tension
between the PA and Hamas failed, but Netanyahu has already gotten away with
that failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, about the last question. Why was the assassination
botched? Mossad murdered Ayyash with a cell phone triggered from a helicopter;
why couldn't they gas this guy in Amman? Israel did not use agents who were
officially stationed in Jordan. This operation was too secret, even for
them. They began to put a special team in place on 19 August, complete with
Canadian passports. By mid-September there were 8 of them. Perhaps they
had enough time to get everything ready, but perhaps not. The Ayyash assassination
took several months to execute. My guess is that Mossad was rushed into
action when King Hussein sent a letter to Netanyahu saying that Hamas was
&quot;ready to stop its attacks on Israel in return for discussing all the
issues that have to be discussed,&quot; and offering to mediate between
Israel and Hamas (HA'ARETZ, 9 October). That letter supposedly got lost
for 3 days, not reaching Netanyahu until after the assassination attempt.
What was the problem? Insufficient postage? Incorrect address? Jewish holiday?
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No. The threat of a truce with Hamas was too dangerous.
A truce would ruin Israel's ability to pursue Zionism under the guise of
seeking security. It could disrupt the Jewish People's covenant with their
God -- a covenant which commands them to kill all non-Jews in Israel and
take great and goodly cities, which they did not build, take houses full
of all good things, which they did not fill, take cisterns hewn out, which
they did not hew, and take vineyards and olive trees, which they did not
plant (see Deuteronomy 6:10-11). Indeed, an offer to be reasonable is a
powerful threat because it could reveal Zionism's underlying motivation
-- and Netanyahu's.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 10 October THE JERUSALEM POST reported that King Hussein
initially thought that the attack on Misha'al was Israel's reply to his
letter. Perhaps it was. And now that the Palestinian Authority has gained
some credibility in the United States, a reasonable proposal for Final Status
Talks would be a very grave threat to Zionism. Again, I urge Palestinians
to make such a threat. Propose a new nation for the Middle East. Propose
that Israel, without the Golan Heights, join the West Bank and Gaza. This
new country should not be called Israel and it should not be called Palestine.
Any other name would be acceptable, but I suggest New Canaan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All current inhabitants of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza
would be citizens of New Canaan, and no citizen would be discriminated against,
or receive privileges, on the basis of religion. People residing outside
of New Canaan who were born in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza could immigrate
to New Canaan with their family and receive automatic citizenship. Otherwise,
immigration policy should be determined by a democratically elected government
in any manner that would not discriminate by religious affiliation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because the United States has been critically responsible
for creating the circumstances which require such a major solution, it would
be reasonable to propose that America guarantee the security of New Canaan's
international borders for 15 years subsequent to its creation and grant
expedited U.S. citizenship to any former Israeli citizen of New Canaan who
wishes to immigrate to the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is important to know your enemy. Benyamin Netanyahu
is Meir Kahane in secular clothing. He is not manipulated by Israeli right-wing
Zionists -- as the Western press is fond of thinking; he is a right-wing
Zionist. The best way to expose this liability is to offer a reasonable
plan for peace and let the world watch his reply. A Final Settlement Plan
that could be openly advocated would be a powerful force -- a force that
Netanyahu could not match.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Immigration policy should be determined by a democratically
elected government in any manner that would not discriminate by religious
affiliation.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>15 Years After the Sabra &amp; Shatila Massacre:
</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The State of Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ghada Khouri*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fifteen years ago, Munir Mohammed survived one of the worst
massacres in the recent history of the Middle East. He was only 12 at the
time, but the memories still haunt him. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the assassination of Lebanese President Bashir
Gemayel and its invasion of Lebanon, Israel sent its proxies&oacute;the
Phalanges and members of the South Lebanon Army&oacute;into the Sabra and
Shatila refugee camps on 16 September 1982. Under the approving and watchful
eyes of the Israelis stationed around the camps, the militiamen went on
a rampage, indiscriminately slaughtering children and the elderly, raping
young girls and women, and butchering unarmed men. About 36 hours later,
approximately 2,000 civilians lay dead&oacute;some so badly dismembered
that they were unrecognizable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While Palestinian refugees gathered to commemorate the
15-year anniversary of the massacre in front of the mass grave in Shatila,
Munir remembered the family he lost and his own ordeal as a survivor. He
recalled how he faked death throughout the night, lying still amid a pile
of bodies and listening to the sound of moans and cries from his mother
Zehrah and baby sister Iman who lay beside him. They both died a few hours
later. Wounded and drenched in blood, Munir made his way out of a heap of
corpses the next morning and was taken to a local hospital. Eleven months
later, he started a new life in the United States. Out of a family of nine
brothers and sisters, Munir has one brother left, Nabil, who settled with
him in America, and one sister, Najat, who still lives in Lebanon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Memories of his childhood growing up in the refugee camp
are now taken over by images of the horror he witnessed as a young boy.
Yet, life goes on in Shatila for thousands of Palestinian refugees and destitute
Lebanese who still live there. About 400,000 Palestinians reside in 12 refugee
camps scattered throughout Lebanon&oacute;Ein El Helweh being the largest
with 75,000 inhabitants. Although the massacre of 1982 is now no more than
an event recorded in the annals of the Palestinians' painful history, another
crime is being perpetrated against the refugees in Lebanon&oacute;the crime
of poverty, marginalization and negligence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and unemployment are part
of the daily life in the camps. While refugees in Syria and Jordan enjoy
various social and civil rights, Lebanon presents a special case due to
the country's delicate sectarian balance and the legacy of a 16-year civil
war. Blamed by a large segment of the Lebanese population for the PLO's
role in the war, the Palestinian refugees command little public sympathy.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eid Khair Ferrawi, a 26-year-old Palestinian born in Bourj
Al-Barajneh camp, described the Sabra and Shatila massacre as a &quot;Zionist
effort to rid the country of 'unwanted elements',&quot; adding that the
Palestinians' legal status in Lebanon today also marks them as 'unwanted.'
While it is not pronounced publicly, Lebanese policy seems to support Ferrawi's
opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Prohibited from practicing 73 different professions, most
Palestinian refugees work as unskilled labourers in construction and agriculture&oacute;low-paying
jobs for which they compete with other foreign workers. UNRWA estimates
that 60% of Palestinian refugees live below Lebanon's poverty line. They
are barred from rebuilding the camps and are excluded from the Lebanese
public health and education systems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since 1995, Palestinians are required to secure entry and
exit visas to and from Lebanon. Ironically, obtaining an exit visa does
not guarantee permission to return to the country. Because of this new law,
several families find themselves separated. &quot;There are cases in which
a father leaves the country to work abroad and support his family still
in Lebanon and is then unable to come back to his wife and children,&quot;
said UNRWA spokesperson Hoda Samra. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As Lebanon continues to grapple with high unemployment,
low wages, corruption and reconstruction in the wake of the devastating
civil war, the Lebanese are more concerned with their own conditions than
with the fate of the Palestinian refugees. During a recent visit to France,
Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Murr raised a storm of controversy when
he placed the presence of armed Palestinians on an equal footing with Israeli
occupation in the south as Lebanon's top security issues. &quot;Almost 20,000
Palestinian refugees are armed,&quot; he stated on 25 September 1997. &quot;All
those who commit crimes on Lebanese soil take refuge in the camps while
our security forces are prohibited from entering the camps by international
conventions.&quot; Only one known fugitive, Ahmad Abdel-Karim Saadi, accused
of masterminding the 1995 assassination of Sheikh Nizar Halabi, is believed
to be hiding out in Ein El Helweh. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While few would go as far as Murr in expressing displeasure
with the Palestinian presence, most Lebanese leaders fear that granting
Palestinian refugees social and civil rights would encourage their settlement
in Lebanon, alleviate Israeli responsibility, and effectively render meaningless
their right to return or receive compensation, as stipulated by United Nations
resolution 194. They are also concerned that absorbing the refugees, who
make up 10% of the Lebanese population, would upset Lebanon's sensitive
sectarian balance and spark renewed civil unrest by adding a large Sunni
population to the country's demographic make-up. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a result of these political considerations, Palestinians
are largely dependent on UNRWA as the main provider of education, social
and health services. UNRWA runs 25 clinics and 73 schools in Lebanon. Its
budget increased by 70% from $32 million in 1993 to $55 million in 1997,
thus dashing speculations that the peace process would soon lead to the
Agency's dissolution. In addition to providing basic services to the refugees,
UNRWA also acts as an employer. About 99% of its 2,400 employees in Lebanon
are Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite its undeniable role in alleviating the hardships
of Palestinian refugees, UNRWA has been unable to satisfactorily meet their
mounting needs&oacute;largely due to a limited budget dependent on voluntary
contributions from UN member states. With a $20 million overall deficit
for 1997, the Agency launched a special emergency appeal to donor states
last July and announced a series of austerity measures, including the imposition
of tuition fees in all UNRWA schools. The proposed service cuts led to a
9-day hunger strike outside UNRWA headquarters in Beirut, which ended when
the donor countries agreed to cover the Agency's deficit during an emergency
meeting on 9 September 1997. Although this year's storm has passed, UNRWA's
financial troubles are chronic. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The perfect solution is to give the Palestinians
everything they need, but we simply can't do it,&quot; Samra said. &quot;UNRWA
is already doing more than its mandate requires in Lebanon because of the
special needs of Palestinians on the ground. For example, it is not within
our mandate to provide secondary school education or hospitalization, but
we are doing it only in Lebanon.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, UNRWA recently opened one secondary school and
provides hospital care through contractual arrangements with 12 private
hospitals. However, in 7% of the cases, including cancer treatment and brain
or open heart surgery, UNRWA only covers a portion of the costs&oacute;usually
less than half&oacute;on a case-by-case basis, according to Samra. Few Palestinians
are able to pay the remaining cost of these life-saving operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>UNRWA's limits on spending have created resentment among
those Palestinians who have felt the brunt of the Agency's belt-tightening
approach to providing services. Samir Khalil, a father of four in Shatila
camp, is still angry that his 12-year-old daughter, who suffered first-degree
burns during the 'war of the camps,' was denied hospitalization. &quot;I
have been running around for years trying to get help for my daughter who
is badly disfigured,&quot; he said. Reconstructive surgery is an expensive
procedure which apparently falls under those hospitalization requests which
are either rejected or only partially covered by UNRWA. &quot;Our conditions
here are miserable,&quot; Khalil added. &quot;There are constant water and
electricity shortages, and no way of making enough money to provide a decent
life for our families. Our fate is determined by how much money UNRWA receives.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pressures on UNRWA have been steadily increasing since
the Gulf War when remittances from Palestinians in the Gulf stopped coming
in and when some of those expelled from various Gulf countries returned
to life in the camps. But in spite of the sometimes tense relations between
UNRWA and the refugee population, Samra asserted that the Agency &quot;will
be here until a final solution is reached.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Such a solution seems as far off today as it was when the
now-defunct peace process began. Indeed, the refugee problem remains one
of the thorniest issues to be addressed in the final negotiations, which
are nowhere in sight. &quot;No one has the right to deny us what we deserve
and that is to return to our homes in Palestine,&quot; said Abou Fadi Hammad,
a Fatah dissident and camp leader residing in Mar Elias. &quot;We do not
intend to permanently settle in Lebanon, but if there is no return, are
we to continue living in abysmal conditions? It's a crime.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For Munir, a new beginning in America has not erased memories
of life and death in Shatila. He shares with those refugees who remain in
the Palestinian camps of Lebanon the aspiration for a Palestinian state
and a right to return to the land his parents fled in 1948. In the meantime,
&quot;there is only one thing that would help make the pain of the Sabra
and Shatila massacre go away,&quot; said the 27-year-old Munir. &quot;And
that is knowing that the Palestinian children growing up in the camps today,
as I did many years ago, can live a life of dignity and respect among their
fellow Lebanese.&quot; </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A cheap way to cut off aid to Israel</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Robert W. McGee*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Washington, DC-based group called the Council for the
National Interest scheduled a &igrave;march on Washington&icirc; on 23-25
October. The theme was END AID TO ISRAEL. It is too early to tell how effective
the march was, since the spigot that pours billions of dollars into Israel
-- about 10% of its GDP -- continues to flow unabated. But the effort is
a step in the right direction. Giving U.S. tax dollars to the oppressive
Israeli government will not stop until American politicians feel they have
to look over their shoulders to see if anyone is noticing their support
for Israel and its anti-human rights agenda. They have to be made to feel
guilty for their abandonment of their fiduciary duty to American voters
to support only policies that are in America's best interests. If there
is no organized opposition, the various Israeli lobbyists will continue
to have complete ownership rights over the U.S. Congress. Thus, events that
increase public awareness of the human rights abuses going on in occupied
Palestine are important.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is a well-known fact that American voters are among
the least informed voters of any country where voting is permitted. Many
of them do not have any informed opinions on major issues, and an alarming
number of voters do not even know the names of the people who represent
them in Congress. That being the case, marches on Washington become all
the more important because of the high visibility that television coverage
provides. But achieving high television visibility for an issue that most
Americans don't care about is not as effective as a multi-dimensional campaign
aimed at making a basic change in policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I have a suggestion -- a very cost-effective and non-violent
suggestion --for solving this whole AID TO ISRAEL problem. The whole thing
might not cost more than $100 million to $200 million, which is much less
than the billions of dollars that Arab governments spend annually on national
defense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is widespread dissatisfaction with the U.S. government
among American voters. That dissatisfaction was evidenced by the relative
success of Ross Perot, who was able to gain millions of votes even though
he didn't really have a political party behind him. He proved that it is
possible to personally fund a national presidential campaign bid. He might
have actually won the 1992 election if he had not dropped out of the race,
then jumped back in, which had the effect of destroying his credibility
and halting the momentum that had been building for months in his favour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Here is my suggestion: Send money to support the Libertarian
Party. The Libertarian Party is the third-largest political party in the
United States. It was the only third party to qualify to be on the ballot
in all 50 states for each of the last two presidential elections. It is
the only major party that is against giving aid to Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The next presidential election is scheduled for November
in the year 2000. If the Libertarian Party can collect about $100 million
by then, it will be able to wage an effective national campaign. Even if
it doesn't win the election, there is still a good chance that America's
foreign aid policy will change. After all, the Socialist Party was the most
successful political party in 20th century America, even though it never
won a major election. It was successful because the two major political
parties adopted most of its platforms. The same could very well happen with
the Libertarian Party in the 21st century. Even if the Libertarian Party
does not win in 2000, it is entirely possible that the Democratic and Republican
parties will adopt most of its party platforms if it makes a strong showing
in the election.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A word of caution, though. It is sometimes illegal for
foreigners to contribute to American politicians, as was highlighted by
the scandals involving Asian contributions to the Democratic Party. But
there are ways around the law. So it is possible that just one Arab billionaire
could help to change the course of history by contributing a measly $100
million or so. Or perhaps 10 Arab multi-millionaires could get together
and contribute just $10 million or $15 million each. That's all it would
take for the Libertarian Party to wage a national media campaign. Isn't
it worth trying, since every other means has failed?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Netanyahu phenomenon: Is it the beginning
of the end?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Azzam Tamimi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many observers, including some Israeli commentators, have
come to the conclusion that Benyamin Netanyahu is the most destructive prime
minister Israel has ever had since its creation in 1948. However, this verdict
does not seem to have much influence on Israeli public opinion since it
has effected no tangible change in the balance of power inside Israel-Netanyahu
is still as popular within his constituency. The damage created by his policies
does not seem to matter much as far as his supporters are concerned. Nevertheless,
some Western and Israeli analysts have grown increasingly anxious about
the prospects of peace in the Middle East. In order to save the peace process
and improve the image of Israel at the international level, some have urged
the United States to intervene (as it did in Chile in 1973) and take Netanyahu
out of power. Inside the Arab and Muslim camps, analysts see the blunders
of the Netanyahu-led government as the catalyst that will usher in a new
era they optimistically imagine will mark the beginning of the end of the
colonial Zionist project in Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The main purpose of the Middle East peace process, which
started with the Madrid Conference in 1991, followed by the Oslo agreement
between the PLO and Israel in 1993 and the subsequent peace treaty between
Israel and Jordan in 1994, was to transform Israel from an alienated and
rejected islet in the midst of a hostile ocean of Arabs and Muslims into
an acceptable neighbour and partner. However, the Israeli Labor Party's
misadventure in Lebanon (believed to have been the main factor that contributed
to its election defeat) and the combination of arrogance and misjudgment
on the part of the Likud successor has convinced those who still needed
persuading in the Arab world that Israel is an entity with whom peace is
an impossibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is suspected that this conviction has now been espoused
by a group of Arab leaders such as PLO's Arafat, Jordan's Hussein and Egypt's
Mubarak, all of whom have already signed peace deals with Israel. These
increasingly skeptical leaders, as well as others in the Gulf and North
African regions, have become rather impatient with, and to a certain extent
embarrassed by, the policies of the Israelis. They have been trying hard
to 'convince', to use a milder term than to 'force', their populations to
normalize relations and co-exist with the Israelis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The most damaging episode-in a series-to Israel's public
relations with Arab governments was the fiasco in Jordan on 25 September
when five Israeli Mossad agents attempted to assassinate Mr. Khalid Mish'al,
Head of the Hamas Political Bureau. The Israeli adventure, which was supposed
to have been a special 'surprise gift' from the Israeli government to the
Israeli public on the eve of the Jewish New Year, turned into a shameful
defeat for Israel and a great victory for the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and the millions of its jubilant supporters around the world. Not
only was Mish'al saved, thanks to the vigilance of his driver and the insistence
of King Hussein of Jordan that Israel provide details of the antidote to
the poison used by its agents in their attempt to kill Mish'al, but the
founder and leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, who had been in prison
for eight years, was released as part of a deal with the Jordanian monarch
in exchange for freeing the five Mossad agents involved in the plot. The
deal also included the release of some Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners
detained in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Too many theories have been devised to explain what went
on and why Israel agreed to release Yassin in spite of the fact that similar
appeals by Yasser Arafat had been turned down repeatedly. There are still
some uncertainties. But what is certain is that King Hussein was offended
by the Israeli misadventure. The attempt to assassinate Mish'al on Jordanian
territory amounted to a stab in the back of the Jordanian Hashemite Kingdom,
which had all along based its relations with Israel upon an undeclared understanding
that Israel would not use Jordan as an arena for liquidating opponents.
Jordan has always been apprehensive about the prospect of its territory
becoming a battlefield between Israel and the Palestinians or among any
other combinations of political foes, be they Arab or non-Arab.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The stab in the back of Yasser Arafat was no less painful.
This is a man who called off his armed struggle to enter into an inequitable,
and even humiliating, peace deal with the enemies of his people and whose
Oslo agreement-legitimized Authority had been pressured by Israel and the
United States into imprisoning Islamic supporters of Hamas and closing down
their social welfare and relief agencies. While persecuting Hamas in the
territory under his control, Arafat's peace partner gave in to Jordanian
demands and ordered the release of Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the person who could-should
he want to-challenge Arafat's leadership and win the confidence of the Palestinian
people. Not only has poor Arafat been discredited in the eyes of most Palestinians
(especially those still in their refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria
waiting for the day of return), who have come to see clearly that the peace
process is bringing them nowhere closer to the restoration of their usurped
rights, but he has also been dealt a blow by Israel who is more willing-that
is from his point of view-to give in to the demands of his historic foe,
King Hussein, even with regard to matters considered to be purely Palestinian,
such as the release of detainees. Perhaps Arafat's misfortune lies in the
weakness of his bargaining position. In fact, he has no more to bargain
with and that is why it has been reported that immediately following the
triumphant return to Gaza by Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, he offered the Israelis
more concessions in exchange for a meeting with Netanyahu to be followed
by a meeting with the Israeli defense minister. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Not much has been said about Arafat's new concessions,
but it is believed that whatever Arafat offers now is of little value to
the Israelis. Nevertheless, Israel might still be interested in boosting
his image by agreeing to eliminate some of the obstacles hindering the operation
of his Gaza airport. Should this happen, Arafat would then claim he was
able to extract some concessions from the Israelis. However, his recent
European tour and the statements he made in Paris and Bonn exposed in the
clearest possible terms his extreme frustration with the Israelis who, according
to Arafat, were not being helpful in any way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the midst of all of this, Hamas and its leader Sheikh
Ahmad Yassin have captured the attention of the world for no less than a
fortnight. Initially there were numerous attempts on the part of the media
as well as some Palestinian officials in Gaza to talk of a tamed Yassin,
a freed prisoner, an ailing and even dying old man, whose detention had
convinced him of moderating his position <I>vis-</I>&agrave;<I>-vis </I>the
conflict between his people and Israel. Yasser Arafat went as far as claiming
that when he visited the Sheikh in his hospital bed at the Jordanian Medical
Centre in Amman soon after his release, he obtained from him a statement
of support for the Oslo accords. Musa Abu Marzouk, former Head of the Hamas
Political Bureau, was present during the brief meeting and insisted that
no political issues were discussed at the time and that the Sheikh never
made such a statement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It did not take long for the entire world to realize the
Sheikh's real position and to see how determined he was. In a rally organized
by his supporters in Gaza more than a week following his return to his home
from Jordan, Sheikh Yassin unequivocally, and to the dismay of Israelis
and their supporters in the West, reiterated the position of the Movement,
namely that it would never recognize a Jewish state in Palestine. However,
the Sheikh had one thing to offer Israel: a truce. Should the Israelis agree
to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, release all Palestinian prisoners,
dismantle all Jewish settlements erected since 1967 andallow the of Palestinian
refugees, Hamas would agree to a cease-fire for a definite period of time
following the elapse of which the struggle for the liberation of the rest
of Palestine would resume. The offer of a truce by Sheikh Ahmad Yassin has
perplexed many observers who find it difficult to assess its seriousness.
What would be the point of such a truce if hostilities were to resume at
a later stage? Hamas leaders argue that a truce is not uncommon in such
conflicts given the history of Muslims, particularly in the struggle to
liberate Palestine from the invading Crusaders in the eleventh century.
A truce of this sort is the only political programme a movement like Hamas
can afford to offer since the target of its struggle, and for that matter
the struggle of the generations to come, would be to put an end to what
is perceived as a new Western colonial project that assumed in the twentieth
century the form of a Zionist state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Within Islamic circles, there is an atmosphere of optimism
that this project is nearing its end. Some go as far as giving Israel no
more than 25 more years of existence. A rapid transformation of regional
geopolitics in favour of the Palestinian cause, the failure of the post-colonial
territorial state and its accompanying secularization process, and the appearance
of serious domestic dissent within Israel are encouraging signs. Islamists
believe that before too long the United States and other Western allies
of Israel will come to realize that it is a much too costly project to maintain.
Some see signs of this already appearing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps it is this atmosphere of optimism that makes the
offer of a truce by Hamas sound realistic. From an Islamic point of view,
Israel no longer has a choice.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu and his circus of clowns</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Annette Winfrey</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Benyamin Netanyahu is quickly losing popularity not only
within the eyes of the world community, but also among his fellow countrymen.
Since he gained office, he has bungled the peace process and has showed
the world his lack of desire for any peace. We have seen a militant Netanyahu.
His countrymen are tired of his hard-line policies; the opinion poll in
the Israeli newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot; indicates that nearly 60% of the
Israelis are displeased with their Prime Minister. However, it doesn't seem
like he will be leaving anytime soon. His own party doesn't want to lose
power and he still has strong support from those who think like him. Recently,
his biggest blunder occurred when he entrusted a mission within the hands
of his &quot;circus clowns&quot;, the Mossad (Israeli intelligence). He
claims he did not know of their plans to assassinate Khaled Misha'al (Hamas'
leader) in Jordan. How could he not know? The 11 October issue of &quot;The
Economist&quot; states that &quot;Mossad, Israel's intelligence service,
plays a unique role in a country that has never known regional security:
its supervision is at the heart of an Israeli Prime Minister's job&quot;
(17).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Mossad really lost respect among world intelligence
agents, blew their covers, embarrassed Netanyahu and has become a laughing
stock in front of their own people. They added to the list of blunders and
ridiculous mistakes that Netanyahu has made. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This attempt had many ramifications. The Economist states
that &igrave;these ramifications include angering King Hussein, offending
Canada (the would-be assassins were using forged Canadian passports), allowing
the invincible Mossad to become a laughing-stock, and making nonsense of
an Israeli policy that exclusively forced Mr. Arafat to crack down on Hamas.
Instead Hamas -- a vowed enemy of the peace process -- has basked in glory
since Israel released its spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in order
to get its own agents out of Jordanian custody.&icirc; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surely Netanyahu and the Israelis did not wish for such
ramifications nor did they want to be the centre stage in front of the whole
world where tnow and looking like fools. Now when they call to the world
to look at Palestinian &quot;terrorists,&quot; everyone will remember their
terroristic assassination attempt. They have lost credibility in the world's
eyes to be a &quot;victim&quot; any longer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To make things worse for Netanyahu, his government and
the Mossad agents, this incident is being played continuously throughout
the world. Not only newspapers, magazines and television stations are highlighting
this incident, but also plays are speaking about it. One fine example is
a play put on by a group of student supporters for Hamas at Gaza's Islamic
University that mocked the Mossad and its &quot;defeat&quot; at the hands
of the Islamist group. The play featured three Mossad agents who were complaining
of their failed attempt on Khaled Misha'al. One stated: &quot;We kill Yahya
Ayyash, we kill Imad Aql, and still they drive us nuts.&quot; Then the trio
receives a phone call from Netanyahu who tells them he is releasing Sheikh
Ahmad Yassin. One agent screamed: &quot;But Mossad rules the world! This
must be a mistake.&quot; They cry at the news while another agent says:
&quot;I resign, I resign.&quot; The viewers received the play warmly (Jordan
Times).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surely this is not the last play about the Mossad's bungled
attempt. They will enjoy centre stage as the clowns of their failed mission
for some time to come.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A Critique of an Allegedly Pro-Palestinian
Liberal Agenda</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush * </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are a few things missing from the ten-point programme
of the Committee on the Middle East (COME), distributed by the weekly electronic
bulletin Middle East Realities (MER), even by the standards of 'international
law' and 'humanity'.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, absent is any mention of U.N. Resolution 194
which pertains to the right of Palestinian refugees from 1948, and their
offspring, to return to their land and property.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even U.N. Resolution 181, which divided Palestine illegitimately
between a minority of Jewish 'immigrants' and a majority of original Arabs
is not mentioned. In 1948, Zionist gangs took upwards of 150% of the amount
of the land &quot;allowed&quot; to them under Resolution 181!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course this is said knowing fully well that the UN is
itself an organ of superpower hegemony, and has recently become a mere branch
of the U.S. Department of State, which on so-called 'Middleeastern' issues,
is controlled by Zionists and their dirty servants.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Is Middle East Realities (MER) a Forum for Normalization?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the key issue of our time for us Arabs and Muslims,
is the issue of normalizing our relationships with our oppressors, i.e.,
accepting our slavery. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With MER, you suddenly find yourself under the spell of
some of those who are oppressing your people! All these good Israelis: they're
expressing your very thoughts which you can't express!! They're saying many
of the right things which you can't get away with saying; they're even doing
many of the right things that you wish the New World Order would allow you
to do.. so instinctively you get sucked in. But as you do, you find yourself
in a deep internal contradiction: You can no longer be against all those
who took your land and property, and threw you to the wolves for several
decades, because after all some of them are 'nice' and 'sympathize' with
your cause! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the question is: If they were so nice, what are they
still doing on OUR Palestine? Whether we or they like it or not, just by
being there, they're displacing a Palestinian person or family who is probably
in a refugee camp in Lebanon or Gaza prevented from work, study, political
rights, human rights, etc...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thus, just because the mainstream media is so anti-Arab
or anti-Muslim, we should not drool and get lost in love because someone
is saying some of what should be said anyway.. We must maintain our separate
identity and position, and keep pressing on with our own agenda, while welcoming
international support.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>On COME's Philosophy of Conflict Resolution in the Region:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Obviously, there are things that we can agree about with
COME, including lifting the embargo off Iraq, and other things. But the
issue that most people forget is that the Palestinian cause is not only
a Palestinian cause, and therefore can't have only a Palestinian solution,
including a Palestinian quasi-state in parts of the West Bank and Gaza...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Assuming all the Palestinians were forced to become Alaskans,
Peruvians, or Middle Koreans, the Palestinian issue still won't be finished
off or resolved. As even the Egyptian government found out many years after
the Camp David Accords:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>THE STATE OF 'ISRAEL' WANTS TO BECOME THE REGIONAL SUPERPOWER
POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY, NOT JUST MILITARILY. IT ALSO SEEKS TO CHANGE
THE ESSENTIAL CULTURAL IDENTITY OF THE REGION FROM ARAB AND ISLAMIC TO ZIONIST,
WESTERN, OR A CONTRIVED 'MIDDLEEASTERN'... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>TO ACCOMPLISH THAT IT NEEDS TO DESTROY EVEN THE STATES
THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE SYCKES-PICOT AGREEMENT, AND THAT HAVE ALWAYS
GONE ALONG WITH WHATEVER THE COLONIAL MASTERS HAVE ASKED IN THE PAST. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>'ISRAEL' NOT ONLY SEEKS TO DENY THOSE STATES A POLITICAL
ROLE IN THE REGION, BUT SEEKS TO FRAGMENT THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES AND DROWN
THEM IN THE HELLFIRE OF CIVIL WARS, TO EVENTUALLY BECOME THE FINAL ARBITRATOR
OF INTERNAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE COPTS AND MUSLIMS IN EGYPT, THE BERBERS
AND THE ARABS IN NORTH AFRICA, THE ARABS AND NON ARABS IN SUDAN, ETC.. THUS
&quot;ISRAEL&quot; AND PEACE ARE NECESSARILY LIKE WATER AND OIL.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One final note about history: Many of the Jews that claim
they are descendants of the Hebrews that passed once upon a time through
Palestine, are actually from the nation of the Khazar, which is ethnically
not even semitic, and which lived until recently in the southern part of
the former Soviet Union. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When their king converted to Judaism sometime in the Eighth
century, according to a book by Arthur Koestler titled 'The Thirteenth Tribe',
they all became Jewish. In fact, they became the Western Jews that now control
'Israeli' politics, media, economy, and army... not to mention the American
media and political system. And now they're making a play for becoming the
spokespersons of the oppressed Palestinians!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There's a famous saying for Ben Gurion about how he doesn't
want the eastern Jews, to make &quot;Israel&quot; easternized (read 'backward'),
but how they, the easterners, should become westernized...Yet most of the
Jews in &quot;Israel&quot; are eastern, and most of those are Arabs who
came from amongst us in Morocco, Yemen, and Iraq, and should be allowed
by the respective Arab governments to go back there in peace to live in
total security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The point is that MER would do better by exposing the historical
lie of Zionism to the world and the Jews, as well as the impossibility of
a peaceful &quot;Israel&quot;, and to advise western Jews to go back to
their ancestral home in the former U.S.S.R, or their political home in U.S.A.,
if they can't stand being oppressors that the indigenous Palestinians have
a legitimate right to resist by all available means.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>When is Terror Not Terror?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Commentary by Michael A. Hoffman II*</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Netanyahu ...lauded Israeli agents who do Israel's
'secret work.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>-New York Times, Oct. 7, 1997</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There's an old joke about the president of the United States.
Waiting outside his office to greet him is the pope of Rome and the chief
rabbi of the Israelis. &quot;Which one should I send in first?&quot; an
aide asks. &quot;Send the pope in first,&quot; the president replies. &quot;I'll
only have to kiss his ring.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even when Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is caught
red-handed ordering the murder of Arab leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan--the
U.S. media will not describe it as a terrorist act, but rather part of the
&igrave;fight against terrorism.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is how Netanyahu's spin-doctor, &quot;image advisor&quot;
Arthur Finkelstein wants the American news agencies to report the attempted
assassination and U.S. media executives have complied. It's not just presidents
who must kiss Jewish posteriors. The Fourth Estate's fearless feature-writers
must pucker up too. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A government which rules by assassination is generally
regarded as barbaric. But even when Jewish secret agents squirt poison in
the ear of an Arab in Amman the way their forebears in Murder, Inc. rammed
ice-picks into wise guys in Brooklyn, somehow it still doesn&iacute;t qualify
as terrorism. Said James Rubin of the U.S. State Department, &quot;We are
not in the habit of second-guessing Israel when it comes to her security.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Squirting poison (Zyklon B perhaps?) in the ear of an Arab
leader is not going to enhance Jewish security. In the eyes of everyone
not dwelling in Zionist Wonderland, government assassination is gangsterism,
not statesmenship. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While the American media seek to transmute the naked truth
about the Mossad's attemted murder into something palatable, the rest of
the world, including 800 million Muslims, will take it for what it is--proof
that the Israelis are the same bunch of bomb-throwing cutthroats who founded
the country in 1948. That the tactics of the Irgun and the Stern gang continue
unabated under the present Israeli administration is patent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When is terror not terror then? Why, when the Jews do it,
of course. The Israelis are not only masters of the double-cross, but the
double-standard. Perhaps we should call their murders, (if the phrase has
not already been coined by some ambitious pundit with an eye on a Pulitzer),
&igrave;deterent retribution.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It's too bad King Hussein released the Mossad agents responsible
for the assassination attempt. What a trial their prosecution would have
made. The victim's account, the strange weapon, their high-level orders-the
whole testimony might even have awakened some Americans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But instead the American people, the ones with the chapped
lips, must continue to apply them to Bibi's backside and chant as they do
so, &quot;Terror is not terror when your Lordship commits it.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was a time, not so long ago, when Americans objected
to the deference the pope required.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Continuing War Against Iraq: An Arabist
View</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Arab nation is a life force that sprang forth from
the confluence of a common history, a common language, a common cultural
heritage molded by the Islamic religion, a common destiny, and a common
geographical area that extends from Mauritania to Iraq, and from Syria to
Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But unlike other nations on this planet, this Arab nation
was not able to express itself politically in the form of the institutions
of a nation-state; one centralized nation-state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Instead, our nation has been divided into scattered fragments
of mini-states, twenty to be exact, and some of its land has been under
direct foreign occupation as is the case of Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thus the borders that separate Arab states should be regarded
as virtually artificial. And consequently the regimes that exist within
these artificial borders should be regarded as completely illegitimate,
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>except to the extent that they try to overcome these artificial
borders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The creation of the Zionist entity of &quot;Israel&quot;
was meant to thwart the unity of the Asian and African wings of the Arab
nation, as much as the persistence of Arab disunity perpetuates the existence
of &quot;Israel&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To prove this point on the presence of a historical linkage
between the Arab-Zionist conflict, on one hand, and the struggle to achieve
Arab unity on the other, Viscount Palmerstone, a former minister of</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Britain, wrote to his ambassador in Istanbul, Turkey, upon
the failure of an attempt by Muhammad Ali Pasha, a ruler of Egypt from the
first half of the 19th century, to reunite the Arab nation due to colonial
and British intervention:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The return of the Jewish people to Palestine, represents
a bulwark against any evil designs prepared by Muhammad Ali or whoever succeeds
him&quot;. (British Foreign Ministry document dated 8/11/1940, JB 78-380
No.134...from Dr. Abdul-Wahab Al-kayaley's book, 'Tareekh Falasteen Al-hadeeth).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Upon the division of our Arab Homeland in 1916 by Syckes
and Picot, the British and French foreign ministers then, oil had not been
discovered yet in Arab lands. Thus the division ensured that any</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>single Arab state on its own would not be able to pose
a serious threat to the interests of colonial powers in the region. Each
Arab state taken by itself is left lacking either in manpower, capital,
water, </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>agricultural land, or some combination of these.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The discovery and nationalization of oil in Iraq made it
possible, upon the availability of a determined leadership, to combine several
elements of power, and hence pose a strategic threat to colonial </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>arrangements; an option that wasn't available to Nassir,
the late president of Egypt, in spite of his Arabist and Unitarian intentions
and plans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore we believe what's taking place now is an attempt
to destroy any potential base of Arab unity regardless of the identity of
the rulers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The purpose of the massive bombardment as well as the genocidal
sanctions has been to destroy Iraq, its scientific and economic installations,
its mosques and churches, its bridges and highways, its tankers and oil
installations, its factories, its people, its civil society, its state,
and its ancient and modern civilizations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What's taking place now is an attempt to rectify and update
the infamous Syckes-Picot agreement, and possibly an attempt to break up
Iraq into smaller pieces, as was suggested by the former National </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Security Advisor Zbignew Brizenski in a forum moderated
by former president Jimmy Carter towards the onset of the aerial campaign.
This is why the allied warplanes kept bombarding mainly non-military targets
in Iraq , and why the governments of the U.S., Britain, and &quot;Israel&quot;,
keep on attacking these very same targets nowadays with murderous sanctions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Iraq will live on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And whether the criminals like it or not, Arab unity IS
coming... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But in the meantime let's all do all that we can to lift
and violate the unjust sanctions against the people of Iraq. It's the least
we CAN do. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>American Media is Changing .. Slowly</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>People all over the United States are crying crocodile
tears, complaining that American media coverage of the Middle East is unfair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the people making this claim are not the Arab Americans,
who have complained about one-sided media coverage of Palestine since the
days of the Balfour Declaration declared the death of a free and independent
Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No, the people whoa re complaining now are American Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chief among them are in fact pillars of the American media
themselves, including A.M. Rosenthal, a pro-Israeli columnist for the New
York Times, and Mort Zuckerman, an editor at three of the most prestigious
and influence mass market publications in the country, USA Today, the New
York Daily News and the Atlantic Monthly magazine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I don't know if the Arab World has an idiom for this circumstance,
but I do know that in the United States we say, &quot;What goes around,
comes around.&quot; Another that comes to mind is &quot;You reap what you
sow.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zuckerman's columns reach millions of American readers
each week. In fact, I don't believe there is one Arab American writer who
is given the same access to an American audience like Zuckerman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact is the American media is biased, but not against
Israel. It is biased in favor of Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For years, my father would brush the media off and say,
&quot;Ray, the American media is controlled by Jews. That is a fact. And,
there isn't one thing that we can do about it.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dad's no longer here, but if he were, I would correct him
and say, &quot;No Dad. The media is not controlled by American Jews. The
media is controlled by people who hate Arabs. And a lot of the media's editors
and reporters happen to be Jewish.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact is, if you replaced every Jewish editor or publisher
with a Christian, the media would still be just as anti-Arab and just as
biased as it always is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Part of the problem is that we Arabs simply have not recognized
the significance of the media or the impact of public relations and the
concept of &quot;perception.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I don't know how many times I have said this, but in America,
&quot;perception is reality.&quot; Reality is not what is true. Reality
is what people want to believe. And, people want to believe what makes them
feel good. And, they want to hear news from people who look, sound and talk
like they do.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They don't want to hear the news from people who look,
sound and act &quot;Arab.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our Arab spokesmen have never recognized a basic principal
of the Art of Debating. You win a debate not just on the strength of your
argument. You win a debate on the strength of your argument and on how you
look and sound. If you look &quot;foreign,&quot; you lose. If you sound
&quot;foreign,&quot; you lose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why doesn't someone tell Yasser Arafat that until he shaves
that famous &quot;five day growth beard,&quot; and change from his khaki
green military fatigues into a pinstripe suit, Americans will not listen
to him and them will not respect him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And, if they don't respect him, they won't believe a word
he has to say.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before Arafat even has a chance to open his mouth in the
United States, he has already lost the support of most Americans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>People like Zuckerman and Rosenthal already know this,
and for years, they exploited this by emphasizing the most negative aspects
of the Palestinian cause, and treating Arabs like statistics instead of
human beings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, why are they complaining now?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact is, it is harder to defend Israel's actions today
than it was, say, 15 years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And, little by little, Arab Americans are starting to better
understand the importance of the news media on the minds of Americans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We are speaking out and complaining more and more about
unfair media coverage. And, some of us are even becoming reporters and journalists,
instead of doctors and lawyers and grocery store owners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The United States is the most important power broker in
the World today. And they have been for generations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One reason for that is that the majority of the news you
receive originates from American controlled or American influenced media
outlets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was only until recently that I started receiving Associated
Press wire service reports about events in Palestine from an Arab writer
named Samar Assad based in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yes, Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Rosenthal, you are starting
to see a change in the way the American media is covering Israel and the
Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But, it is not because the media is becoming &quot;more
biased&quot; against Israel, as you assert.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is because the American media is starting to become
a little more fairer to the Palestinians and the Arabs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If that is what you consider to be unfair, then obviously,
you are part of the problem.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Where's Freedom of Speech?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where is democracy in Jordan sailing away to? One must
wonder what the Jordanian government is planning these days. A couple of
weeks ago, 13 weekly newspapers were closed. Where's the freedom of speech
that most democracies claim to possess? The government states that these
newspapers do not possess enough working capital, which is a stipulation
under a new law that was written about three months ago. The new law makes
it mandatory for all newspapers to have a working capital of JD 300,000
(about US $450,000).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why was such a law invented anyway? I guess it's easier
to close dissident voices and their disliked opinions than to go around
censoring everything. This is a tragedy. How can people check themselves,
keep their government in check (the government is supposed to be in the
service of its people) or to check society if no one is allowed to voice
their opinion through the written word? True, a few weekly newspapers have
remained and the daily newspapers are in full swing; they were able to comply
with this new law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the old weekly newspapers added spice and a new
flavour to every week of life. Some contained stories that amazed while
others sported people's political and other opinions. One fine example of
freedom of speech was exhibited in &quot;Al-Mejd&quot; (The Glory), which
is a political weekly that allowed, within the same issue, articles from
Muslims, Christians, Communists, Democratists, and any other interested
groups. It gave a speaking floor to everyone. This is an ideal form of democracy,
if only all people could achieve such a thing. People can learn from each
other and work in cooperation while respecting different views. It was utopia,
but now it has been suspended and may possibly have been shattered. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These brave weeklies are not giving up so easily. They
are fighting for survival in the courts. The are saying that the government
is acting unfairly. Lawyers have stepped in to take their cases. Some weeklies
claim they have registered the demanded amount of capital, but still they
have not been allowed to reopen. Under the new law, they have until mid-November
to gain approval, otherwise they will remain permanently closed. What will
this do to the &quot;free&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; lives of Jordanians?
If this occurs, what else will it pave the way for in the future? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let's take a look at more of Jordan's &quot;democratic&quot;
practices. Even the newspapers that remain open must create a new breed
of writers. Of course, this phenomenon is happening all over the world.
Today's newspaper and magazine writers have become more creative out of
necessity. The readers must be experienced in reading mysteries in order
to pick up the clues that lead them to decipher the truth from the facade
of what they read. Sometimes it is not their fault, but rather their source
who leads them on a wild-goose chase and gives them crumbs of facts. The
writers must become great detectives, yet, in many cases they must be eloquent
and subtle to avoid troubles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One such example is the assassination attempt of Hamas
leader Khaled Misha'al in Jordan. One Arab daily newspaper stated the official
version of the facts, which insulted the intelligence of the reader. Within
the same article, the writer stated that Misha'al had been injured while
Canadian tourists argued with one of Misha'al's guards. Then he goes on
to say that the weapon used was a new, technological weapon. This makes
one wonder: Why do tourists need a new, technological weapon? Then, he stated
that three others were waiting outside the gate. Why would tourists wait
outside the gate in attack formation? The writer and his source treated
our skilled and thinking intelligence as if we were children. It was clear
that it was an assassination attempt from the very beginning. Luckily, the
truth, which could not be contained, eventually came out. We now know the
assassins were Israeli Mossad agents who were carrying fake Canadian travel
documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What would have happened if the truth had never gotten
out? Would we have ever been told willingly? We need to consider the freedom
of the press. It is vital news for all to know especially Jordanians. A
journalist must stick to his principles of uncovering the truth, otherwise
why is he writing if not to inform the public? Maybe he fears for his job
and feels forced to always accept the official version. Most daily papers,
with the exception of &quot;Arab Today&quot;, has half of their stocks owned
by the government. This fact does put a writer in a sticky position if he
wants to differ from the official statement. Most do not dare. So, where
will democracy crawl under to hide? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More Jordanian democracy of freedom of speech and opinion
can be seen in the treatment given to one of the candidates running for
Jordanian Parliament. At this moment, people are campaigning and hanging
up posters before the 3 November elections. One Christian candidate hung
up 100 or so posters that stated his views and position. He stated that
he was anti-Zionist and against normalization with Israel. Suddenly, police
officers swooped down and tore away the posters. With this kind of behaviour,
what are we being led to think? What is happening to the peaceful, democratic
Jordan? If a man cannot even speak his opinion, then what will he be able
to do or &quot;not&quot; to do? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jordanian society and government needs to look at these
recent actions and ponder their motives and what direction they really want
to take the country in as we face the beginning of the 21st century. Jordan
has come a long way and it has advanced technologically and ideologically
to become a world leader that has gained much respect in that arena. It
has played a big role in the peace process and has been a stable democracy
in this region. However, such recent anti-democratic actions could cause
them to slide backwards. We need to consider these actions and the future
of Jordan. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>New record for human rights violations</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many of the Palestinian people thought that the signing
of the accords would not only bring them peace throughout their land but
also peace of mind; however, what took place on the ground was a completely
different matter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights reports from many international organizations
aroused concerns about deteriorating conditions for the oppressed. The Palestinians
endured violations of international accords and declarations, in addition
to the overall injustice prevailing in the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The 1996 annual report of the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) is further documentation outlining the poor conditions
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The report clearly demonstrates that
the closure of the territories (a regular practice used by the Israeli authorities
against the Palestinians) has had disastrous &igrave;economic implications&icirc;,
in addition to the problems that have been &igrave;encountered [by the Palestinians]
in transport, education and health care, particularly since access to Jerusalem
was likewise restricted.&icirc; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report also stated that as a result of the closure
policy, &igrave;many families remained separated for several months since
there was no free passage for people between the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank.&icirc; Palestinian security detainees held exclusively on Israeli
soil had no visits from their families for months, and students were unable
to reach their respective places of study. In addition, the number of medical
evacuations was delayed with very serious consequences and many times required
the intervention of the ICRC. The disastrous consequences aside, one should
keep in mind that the closure policy in itself (even if it hadn&iacute;t
brought about all of the foregoing complications) is a collective punishment
that violates basic human rights of an individual, let alone a nation; article
Nos. 2 and 13 of the International Declaration for Human Rights guarantees
the right of freedom of transport within the borders of a State, in addition
to the protection of all human rights for a population under occupation.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for the arrests of Palestinian citizens, the report
of the ICRC states that &igrave;the number of Palestinian detainees held
by Israel stabilized at an average of 4,000 at the last major release of
some 1,200 in January 1996 under the interim agreement.&icirc; Arrests nevertheless
continued at an average rate of more than 300 per month. Virtually all the
Palestinian detainees were put in places of detention on Israeli soil, a
violation of the 4th Geneva Convention. The ICRC was given access to all
detainees protected by the Convention, with the exception of two Lebanese
nationals detained in Israel since 1989 and 1994. It was denied access to
another detainee known to be held by Israeli authorities since early 1996.
The ICRC repeatedly requested the release of 29 Palestinians held by the
Israeli authorities on humanitarian grounds. Seven of the detainees concerned
had been released by the end of 1996, while the majority remained incarcerated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ongoing unjust procedures and poor living conditions
borne by the Palestinian people have gone beyond the normal capacity of
a human being without a doubt. However, what is happening now in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip does not show any true will for peace or any genuine
steps towards a solution.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>When the Sandal is on the Other Foot </FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When it comes to double standards, Israel takes the cake.
They manage to speak so eloquently from both sides of their mouth at one
time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From deep in the Negev Desert, Israeli officials loudly
proclaim the necessity to imprison thousands of Palestinian civilians on
charges they insist that they need not explain to anyone, including the
person who is imprisoned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The prison terms average six months, but often run into
years. These prisoners are neither given the opportunity to defend themselves
in a court of law -- where Israel believes it need not take most Palestinians
-- and it insists that its security far outweighs the obvious violations
of human rights that these imprisonments exact upon their non-Jewish victims.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the other hand, from both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israeli
officials are crying crocodile tears complaining about the &quot;injustices&quot;
of the Arab countries, such as Egypt, and even the United States where two
of their &quot;spies&quot; have been caught red handed!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You see, when the sandal is on the other foot, Israel feels
it deserves more than it is willing to give.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Take, for example, the case of Jonathan Pollard; a U.S.
Naval Intelligence Officer who stole top secret documents from the U.S.
Government to give to Israel so that Israel could identify American spies
and expose American defenses. Israel could resell that information to other
countries that opposed the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He was sentenced before a court of Law. He was given an
attorney and the right to a legal defense. The Israeli government even admitted
that Pollard was their spy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He was given the right to raise funds in the United States
and in Israel to pay for his defense.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the end, Pollard was convicted in a democratic court
of law and sentenced to life by that court of law. His jail term is filled
with the comforts of normal life, including a television, good food, excellent
medical attention, and the right to see his family and friends on a regular
basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pollard continues to receive far more than any of the thousands
of Palestinians who remain in the harsh environments of Israeli jails and
prisons -- prisons that are more like concentration camps. Nonetheless,
Israel wants Pollard released.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then there is the case of Azzam Azzam, an Israeli citizen
for whom the evidence clearly shows he was spying for Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Egypt, Azzam could be sentenced to death -- a fitting
punishment for someone who participates in espionage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel argues in response that Azzam should be released,
insisting also that he should not be executed, because Israel does not execute
its prisoners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oh really? How about those so-called &quot;terrorists&quot;
who were caught by Israeli soldiers and executed on the spot because the
soldiers hated Arabs so much? How many times has that happened in the past,
denied at first, and then admitted in the memoirs of some retired Israeli
Mossad agent or military officer. The Israelis are relentless and they invoke
every moral argument available to support their case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But where do they find these moral arguments? In the jails
in the Negev Desert where Palestinians are mistreated daily, abused, punished,
and denied the very basic human rights that are advocated by the very same
Geneva Convention that Israel refuses to recognize?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oh, how moral is Israel? I just wish Israel would apply
the same standard of morality to the Palestinian People that it so hypocritically
demands for its &quot;own&quot; people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But that might be asking too much from a country that claims
to be &quot;the only Democracy in the Middle East.&quot;</FONT></P>

</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Lobby's Impact on U.S. Foreign Policy</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>This study is authored by Dr. Ahmad Yousef, the Director

Rauch, the President of The Multicultural Alliance, Washington. The Palestine
Times will publish it in parts.</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Part 3</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>II. Current United States Policy Toward
Islamist</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>States and Political Movements </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the aftermath of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet
Union and the discrediting of Communism, a threat vacuum was created that
gave rise to a search for new enemies. For a short period of time, the enemy
was the economic challenge represented by the Japanese and the European
Community. That fear, of course, had very little to do with the U.S.-Israeli
relationship and it soon gave way to a new fear, one which was much closer
to Israel's requirements. The pro-Israeli forces began their call for renewing
the U.S.-Israeli strategic alliance on the grounds of an emerging Islamic
threat. They view the Islamic revival as a threat to the national interests
of the United States. Why? Because they see it as a threat to Israeli national
interests. Now, and for some time, U.S. policy makers have been in a situation
where their support is solely for the propagation of Israeli national interests,
irrespective of, or with little respect for, how the situation affects their
own nation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The truly bothersome aspect of this situation is that the
Israeli lobbying effort, whose main proponents are choosing to live here
while demonstrating their allegiance to a foreign country sometimes from
within the most influential positions in the United States government, does
not attempt to influence Israel's policies so as to bring them into conformity
with United States interests just as it is fond of doing with other governments.
On the contrary, the objective of these lobbyists is to pressure and compel
the United States to accept the policy directions and priorities of Israel,
which are, in turn, defined by whatever Israeli government happens to be
in power inside Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just before one Israeli election, a major spokesman for
the Jewish community in America was quoted in the Jerusalem Post as saying:
&igrave;If the Alignment wins and changes Israel's policies, we will support
them; if the Likud wins and pursues a strong line in the West Bank, we will
get behind them.&quot; And, as Paul Findley, a Republican congressman from
Illinois for 22 years, discovered, whoever the Israeli prime minister is
at any given time is himself an irresistible force in American politics:
&quot;The Israeli Prime Minister has a lot more influence over the foreign
policy of the United States in the Middle East than he has in his own country.&quot;
Witness the standing ovation given to Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu
at the joint session of Congress after his election, in which he elaborated
in depth on his political-religious ideology of expansion, settlement and
repression against the Palestinian people, and in which he attempted, successfully,
to further enmesh the American people in a new Middle Eastern cold war,
a war against &quot;terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Coupling this with the fact that the Israeli political
apparatus in the United States is so very powerful, one could have predicted
that its stance on the Islamic revival would not fall on deaf ears. The
policies which were initially propounded as the official positions of the
Clinton Administration toward this region are built around several different
concepts. We now undertake to explain and elaborate upon the framework of
these policies and how they have developed in practice over the course of
the Clinton Administration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>First, the U.S. government claims that it does not view
Islam as the next &quot;enemy&quot; confronting the West or threatening
world peace. The United States government articulated this policy during
the Clinton term in an effort to clear itself from the accusations in that
regard brought forth by Muslims. We stand by such accusations, since, in
reality, nothing has changed except the manner in which this policy is elaborated.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, on the sixteenth anniversary of the
Islamic Revolution in Iran this year, claimed that &quot;the West and particularly
the United States wants to confront Islamic fundamentalism the same way
it challenged Communism. It is a mistaken comparison and a policy that will
only strengthen the [Islamist] movement.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Second, the United States policy says that the Cold War
is not being replaced with a new competition between Islam and the West.
At the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference, an international meeting held
in Khartoum, Sudan in March 1995, one theme emerged: the current revival
of Islam as a political force has caused the West, the United States specifically,
to treat Muslims who engage in political change as enemies in a new cold
war.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Third, Americans recognize Islam as one of the world's
great faiths. Islam is practiced on every continent. It counts among its
adherents millions of citizens of the United States. The United States acknowledges
Islam as a historic civilizing force among the many that have influenced
and enriched the Western cultures, but it does not recognize or tolerate
modern Islamism as a political force either within the United States or
in the Middle East.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fourth, throughout the Middle East and North Africa, the
United States is aware of groups or movements that are presently seeking
to reform their societies in keeping with Islamic ideals. There is considerable
diversity in how these ideals are expressed. Of the nearly 1 billion Muslims
in the world, a vast majority live outside the Arab world and differ linguistically,
ethnically, racially and culturally with the Arab world and with one another.
There are large Muslim populations in South and South-East Asia, in China
and in Africa. Approximately 90% of the world Muslim population is Sunni,
but there are minority sects and branches that must be recognized. In short,
there are countless differences among the various Muslim peoples that inhabit
the modern world. The United States has failed to understand this, and instead
it attempts to deal with the Muslim sphere as if it were a single entity.
If the &quot;Islamic threat&quot; did not exist, the United States might
have invented it. And the United States government, in a kind of self-fulfilment,
may yet still create it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fifth, the United States does not imagine that there is
some monolithic bloc or international effort (i.e., a conspiracy) behind
the plethora of Islamist groups and movements in the world that constitute
the political manifestation of the Islamic revival. At the same time, however,
it expresses concern over Iran's sponsorship of what it terms &quot;extremist&quot;
groups throughout the region and over the perceived role of Sudan in supporting
such groups in North Africa, as if to imply that the Islamist movements
in question would not have existed but for Iranian or Sudanese sponsorship,
or that they are conducting their activities on behalf of these governments
rather than acting on their own behalf.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sixth, United States policy holds that those governments
which seek to broaden political participation will find the United States
supportive. This is not always true, not if the state in question opposes
some aspect of what the United States claims as its interests in the region.
For instance, the United States was surprised and annoyed by the fact that
it was from within the most politically open Middle Eastern countries that
the strongest voices of public opposition to the war campaign against Iraq
were heard. On the other side of the coin, Washington is not proposing to
withhold its support from those states that are repressive, as long as they
do not contradict what the United States strategic affairs establishment
terms &quot;vital national interests&quot; (the American oil interest in
the Gulf, for example) or, implicitly, any of Israel's regional interests
or policy goals (such as the peace process or the international legitimacy
of its nuclear stockpile). The U.S. policy of &quot;enlargement&quot; as
formulated by the Clinton team, that is, enlargement of the democratic realm,
specifically exempts the Middle East by failing to mention it in this regard
in its list of every other region of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Seventh, the U.S. purports to differ with those states,
political movements or individuals who&oacute;regardless of their religion&oacute;practice
&quot;terrorism&quot;, offer safe haven to &quot;terrorists&quot;, resort
to violent means to achieve political ends, reject the peaceful resolution
of conflicts, oppress minorities, preach intolerance or hatred, disdain
political pluralism, or violate internationally accepted standards regarding
human rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the Middle East, however, these positions are taken
selectively against those governments toward which the United States has
already adopted an adversarial posture (such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya
and, to some extent, Syria). But those governments to which it has pledged
its support no matter what (i.e., Israel), as well as those states that
follow American diplomatic initiatives or adopt its general policy priorities
as their own, the above standards are completely ignored. Therefore, it
is not the policy stance itself that possesses substance: after all, every
government and most political movements, including Israel's own pre-state
organizations, have used violent means to achieve political goals. Rather,
it is the criteria of selection that is important: the manner in which it
is decided which countries are subjected to the standards and which countries
are exempted is the subject deserving of deeper inquiry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eighth, U.S. policy holds that religion does not determine,
positively or negatively, the course of U.S. relations with other countries.
This is evidenced by the fact that the United States has the same basic
differences with the secular and quasi-secular governments in Iraq and Libya
respectively as it does with the Islamist governments of Iran and Sudan,
for instance. In other words, Washington claims it is opposing these states
because they practice terrorism, resort to violence, reject the peaceful
resolution of conflicts, oppress minorities, preach intolerance, disdain
political pluralism, and violate internationally accepted standards regarding
human rights, not because they are Islamic states or because they have instituted
Islamic legal codes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Roughly translated, it means that the religious character
of the state and/or movement in question is not one of the criteria for
selecting who is to be subjected to the purported standards of conduct;
therefore, religion can be eliminated from the inquiry. This is in large
part accurate. Despite some lingering suspicions in the region, Islamic
states and movements are not being discriminated against or subjected to
the double standard because of the fact that they are Islamic. They are
being treated in an adversarial manner because of what the United States
calls their &igrave;extremism&icirc;, in other words, because some of their
foreign policy stands are different from those of the United States. The
tag &quot;extremism&quot; supposedly refers to the use or espousal of violent
change, but as we have already pointed out, all governments use violence,
not only Iran or Sudan. The term is used simply as a propaganda tag, to
de-legitimize those Middle Eastern and Islamic countries that do not agree
to blindly follow what is set out by the policy makers in Washington, and
by extension, in Tel Aviv.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Thanksgiving and the Iron Lady</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A few Thanksgivings ago, before the destruction of Iraq..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a regal room in the White House, a spacious table was
set for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner. George and Barbara had invited a small
group of only 500 people to their private celebration. The enticing table
was spread with every delectable food the mind could imagine while stuffed
turkeys jutted their legs out in tasty temptation. Glasses of dark wine
sparkled while cranberries glistened under heavy chandeliers. Turkey gravy
mixed with special spices blended with the turkey aroma and sifted about
the savory room.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Under the table, Millie sat impatiently awaiting tender
morsels to fall into her hungry mouth. She seemed dejected and disappointed
that she had been denied her usual place at George's table but George had
scolded her with, &quot;Now, Millie, we'll have none of that. I've told
you before, when we have company, your place must be under the table. Since
you wrote your memoirs, you've become too high-handed.&quot; Millie sadly
looked at George while he spoke. &quot;Oh don't look at me with those beseeching,
doleful eyes. You know you're one of the family, but in front of others,
we must be more discreet.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With a naughty jump, Millie had slurped George on his pleading
face and nearly licked his glasses off. George pushed her under the table,
straightened his tie and fluffed his limp sagging hair. He had told Barbara
(his hairdresser) to do something about his hair so it would take on more
life and fill out his thin face, but it was so hard to convince her of any
of his innovations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just then, as George was straightening himself, Ron and
Nancy strode in, their arms entwined in rhapsody as though they had recently
married. George's eyes ran up and down the charming couple with envy. He
viewed Ron's full head of very black hair (only his hairdresser knew for
sure). Imagine, not one gray strand and he was fast approaching 80! His
eyes then fell on Nancy who looked stunning in her new gown. He adored the
bones that protruded out on her emaciated parched face and her shriveled
hand stretched out to meet his.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Ron, Nancy! So glad you could come. I just had to
have this little get-together,&quot; George said as he stood on his toes
to greet Ron and then bent down to kiss Nancy's hand. &quot;You know I have
to celebrate Thanksgiving in the sands of the Gulf with the boys and I so
hate cold turkey. Bar feeds me enough of that after Thanksgiving's over.
My your hand feels so icy Nancy.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We know how you feel, son,&quot; Ron said, warmly
in sympathy. &quot;But we all have to sacrifice for the sake of oil, uh,
that is, democracy. You go there and tell those American boys just what
it is they're going to die for!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Oh, sure, Ron. I'll tell them in the name of freedom,
democracy, justice and to kick out that Hitler of a man, Saddam. I'll assure
them that when we ship their dead bodies back home, it won't be in black
garbage sacks as rumoured, but in genuine wooden boxes. We'll all bestow
on them the Purple Medal of Honour when they die for their country, though
I don't know what the heck they want with any medals when they're dead!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;For their families, moron. I've told you this before.
You've got to learn how to play your role right,&quot; growled Ron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Ron, you promised you'd be polite,&quot; Nancy broke
in. &quot;So nice to see you Georgie. Sorry to hear about our Republican
defeat. I guess people aren't as stupid as we thought they were.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Thanks Nancy,&quot; George said with embarrassment.
&quot;I guess people are just frustrated because we didn't obliterate Iraq
from the beginning. I'm trying to stir up more hate by claiming the hostages
taken by Iraq are being mistreated so I can attack that blasted country
as soon as possible!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We know you're doing your best Georgie,&quot; Nancy
said as she patted his hand with obvious sympathy. &quot;By the way, why
is your face wet? Are you sweating? Where's Bar?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Oh, no, that's just one of Millie's slobbery kisses.
You know how affectionate she is. But I've been firm with her. I told her
she had to sit under the table, not at the table. I've been reading a book
called The Strong-Willed Dog and I've even included some of the ideas into
my presidential policy,&quot; he said while taking out his handkerchief
to mop his face as he reddened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was then that Barbara made her grand entrance. All faces
turned in awe at the lovely vision she created. If only she were 50 years
younger! Her face was powdered pink and blue, and her silver gray hair,
puffed and sprayed, while huge pearls choked the loose skin on her neck.
She looked like a fresh winter breeze. Her Nile-blue gown floated about
her as she glided along greeting her guests. Finally she approached her
adoring Georgie, smiled and gave him a sharp little kick while she said
under gritted yet smiling teeth, &quot;George, I told you not to invite
that tainted woman here to our dinner! There's word that you two are sneaking
around behind my back. I don't trust either of you. You both have too much
in common. Birds of a feather flock together. I heard that you promised
to give her an oil well when you reclaim Kuwait as part of America!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A dog's lick and now a wife's kick! This was too much.
George clenched his teeth in pain while beads of sweat broke out on his
lean face, which turned purple with chagrin. &quot;Bar, what's wrong with
you? Have you been taking too many pep pills lately? Just take it easy.
Who's this tainted woman you're talking about? I don't know any tainted
women except Dolly, Marilyn, Betty, Roxanne, Linda, Karen, and Tammy Baker!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She peered at him eagle-like as her mouth stretched in
a thin line and her eyes narrowed. &quot;I'll not have you telling hopeless
lies. Remember that I'm not your gullible American public, I'm your wife.
Don't play innocent with me. You know who I'm talking about. It's that horrible
woman...you know, Maggie! I told you not to invite her to our Thanksgiving
dinner. I'm surprised you did not obey my orders. You may rule this country,
but remember, I rule you!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>George choked on his wine and said, &quot;But Bar, darling.
You know I've never loved anyone but you and 20 or so other women! Maggie's
not my type. In fact, I don't think she's anyone's type, but she's the 'iron
lady' dear, and she supports my campaign against Iraq 100%. If anyone's
going to get an oil well, I assure you, it will be my Bar!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Humph,&quot; she snorted in disbelief.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They stopped their conversation as one of the maids rang
the bell for dinner. The sound echoed in the huge room and all the useless
chitchat ceased. The honoured guests gathered around the splendid feast
with growling stomachs and hazy heads. George was by now severely frustrated
by the Republican defeat in his home state as well as elsewhere and by Barbara's
groundless accusations. Her sharp kick still hurt but he bent his head in
a prayer of thanks and then followed this by his annual Thanksgiving speech.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You see, it all began when our forefathers landed
on the shores of America and struggled to survive in a strange and harsh
country. The Indians showed them how to plant and harvest crops and raise
turkeys. The pilgrims shared their first Thanksgiving with their Indian
friends. Then when the settlers increased in number and grew stronger, they
expressed their appreciation to their friends by killing them off and stealing
their land from them. Brave Americans armed with guns, cannons and cunning,
took the defenseless and trusting Indians' best land from them and forced
them to live on the worst land in reservations. Not only was buffalo hunting
a great American sport and pastime, but so was Indian hunting. We invented
the idea of chemical warfare when we long ago infected the blankets we donated
to the Indians in charity by weaving small pox germs in with the fibres.
They had no resistance to this disease, as it had never appeared before
the advent of the settlers. Small pox thus wiped out whole groups of people
and sometimes whole tribes. Most impressive!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We now face an even greater task before us. We must
destroy this Saddam person. He has become too powerful. His presence will
destabilize the balance of power in the Middle East. We must keep our leaders
and our best friend, Israel, the only powerful country in the area. Of course,
we don't really want democracy to catch on there. We only want the Arabs
to think they have democracy. We've got to bomb Iraq and do our duty to
poor Gabbie and give him back Kuwait, &quot;yesterday before today!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With these words, the guests stood on wobbled legs and
vigorously clapped their hands and then drank a toast to honour the brilliance
of their Georgie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Georgie smiled in victory as just then his special guest
of honour, the &quot;iron lady&quot; strode in wearing a tweed suit to match
her tweedy face. She had recently cut her hair to give her a more manly
look...George glued his eyes on Maggie in admiration still trying to figure
out if that darn hair was a wig or not. His vision blurred in complete infatuation
for her character, her charisma and her outdated colorful ideas that belonged
to the Victorian age. He was crazy about old-fashioned women. He mustn't
let Bar know he really had promised Maggie some blown-up oil wells in her
name. He did so adore her little bunny teeth and how she gnawed on carrots,
crackers and toast. He could hardly wait to compare defeat notes with her.
But, just a minute, hadn't Ron promised him that, &quot;you can fool all
the American people all of the time?&quot; He must remember to speak to
that man before he charges off to the Gulf to meet those crazy young American
boys who were going to die for the great American dream, the American way
in the lonely burning sands of Desert Shield. Perhaps Millie could give
him some helpful hints and his scriptwriter must be sure to write the best
speech ever. George had to remember to act angry and look sincere when he
faced his troops. Drunk with wine, victory and imagined fame, George's head
swam in confusion as he fell face down in the cranberry sauce.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Khalisa Before 1948</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village was located on a low hill on the northwestern
edge of the al-Hula Plain-a location that spared it from the periodic floods
of Lake al-Hula. It overlooked the plain on the north and the south. Al-Khalisa
was on a highway that led from al-Mutilla in the north to Safad and Tiberias
in the south, near the Lebanese border. Its proximity to Lebanon and Syria
gave the village special significance as a commercial center. In 1596, al-Khalisa
was a village in the nahiya of Jira (lfwa' of Safad) with a population of
160. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as
well as on other types of produce and property, such as beehives, water
buffalos, orchards, and a water-powered mill.  In the late nineteenth century,
Europeans passing through the area described al-Khalisa as a small village
built of stone and situated on a plain. Surrounded by streams, the village
had a population of about fifty.  The Bedouin of the al-Ghawarina clan were
the original founders of the village and constituted most of the population.
Temimi and al-Katib (1916) described the generous reception accorded to
them by the head of the tribe and the large guest house with rugcovered
floors in which they were received.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The houses of al-Khalisa were made of bricks and basalt
stones, cut from the hillside. In 1945 its population consisted of 1,820
Muslims and 20 Christians. Al-Khalisa had a boys' elementary school, which
also admitted students from neighboring villages, and a village council
that administered its affairs. The villagers drew their drinking water from
several springs. They derived their income from both agriculture and commerce.
In 1944/45 they planted 3,775 dunurns in cereals; 5,586 dunums were irrigated
or used for orchards. The villagers held a weekly market in which goods
from al-Khalisa and neighboring villages were sold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 11 May 1948, the Haganah rejected al-Khalisa's request
for an &quot;agreement,&quot; and Israeli historian Benny Morris reports
that the villagers felt threatened and decided to leave. In addition, they
would have heard that their district capital, Safad, had been captured that
same day. Given that Operation Yiftach's commander Yigal Allon intended
to expel as much of the area's population as possible during the offensive,
it is not surprising that the Haganah rejected the offer of a truce. Zionist
forces probably moved into the village shortly afterwards, as part of their
general offensive in eastern Galilee, which was called Operation Yiftach.
Plan Dalet had originally called for the occupation of the British police
station in the village, but it is not clear when the order was carried out.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Villagers interviewed in later years by Palestinian historian
Nafez Nazzal gave a more detailed picture of the occupation. They said they
fled from their homes after hearing news of the fall of Safad and sought
refuge in Hunin, to the northwest. But the village militia remained for
a few days, until it was heavily shelled from the Jewish settlement of Manara
and saw an armored unit approaching the village. The militiamen retreated
through the hills-Zionist forces controlled the roads-and made their way
to Hunin. Eventually, the villagers were displaced from there to Lebanon.
In later weeks, a few of them decided to return in order to dig up money
they had buried in their land, or to harvest some of their tobacco and grain.
They reported that the Israeli forces had burned and destroyed many of the
houses. &quot;The village was in ruins,&quot; said one villager who returned
briefly.</FONT></P>
