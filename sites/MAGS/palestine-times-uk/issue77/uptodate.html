Bethlehem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (29 November)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As many as 40 Palestinians were injured when Israeli occupation
soldiers opened live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas at Palestinian
demonstrators protesting the continuing detention of Itaf Elayan, an Islamic
Jihad activist on a hunger strike since here abduction by Israeli soldiers
38 days ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to eyewitnesses, more than 5000 Palestinians
marched through Bethlehem streets Saturday afternoon, demanding the release
of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, when the protesters drew closer to the Bilal Mosque
(Rachel Tomb), Israeli soldiers guarding the site opened fire and rubber
bullets, and gas canisters, indiscriminately, injuring scores of Palestinians,
young and old.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A foreign journalist at the site used the term &quot;mayhem&quot;
to describe the situation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I am sure they wouldn't use this sort of violence
with their own people...They (Israeli soldiers) are treating the Palestinians
as inferior people..&quot; the journalist said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Muslims as well Christians took part in the demonstration,
and followers of Fatah, Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and the leftist groups
also took part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Scores of people suffocated as a result of gas inhalation,
and ambulances were transferring people to hospitals until after 4:00 GMT.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Palestinian legislative council member, Salah al Ta'amari,
was also lightly injured.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Further protests in solidarity with Elayan also took place
in Hebron, Ramallah, Jenin, and Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Jenin, a letter written by Elayan and leaked from Ramle
hospital, where she is being detained, called on Palestinians &quot;not
to let us down.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More protests are expected for this week.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian protests continue in solidarity
with Elayan</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (26 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Protests, sit-ins and demonstrations continued throughout
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for the fourth consecutive week in solidarity
with political prisoner Itaf Elayan, the Islamist activist abducted last
month by Israeli soldiers while traveling from Bethlehem to Beir Zit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday, Palestinians representing various political
orientations held silent protests outside Red Cross offices in several Palestinian
towns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Hebron, protesters urged human rights organization to
double their efforts on Elayan's behalf, because even the life of one human-being
&quot;matters.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamic Jihad activists renewed earlier warning that &quot;we
would carry out a massive retaliation if <I>something</I> happened to sister
Elayan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli intelligence seems to take these threats seriously.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli English daily, <I>the Jerusalem Post,</I> quoted
intelligence officials as saying they suspected that the Islamic Jihad organization
was responsible for last week's fatal shooting of a Jewish settler in East
Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, himself a former
freedom prisoner, joined Palestinian protests in Gaza in solidarity with
Elayan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin said the Palestinians wouldn't rest until &quot;all
prisoners are released.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He mentioned Itaf Elayan by name, saying that &quot;we
are with you sister Itaf and we want you to know that you are not alone
and that we will not let you down.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasin also lambasted the Palestinian Authority for &quot;keeping
Palestinian political prisoners in Palestinian jails,&quot; saying &quot;how
could we demand the release of our brothers and sisters from Israeli jails
while the Palestinian National Authority continues to incarcerate political
prisoners.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Further protests in solidarity with Elayan are scheduled
for Saturday and Monday, in Bethlehem, Hebron and Beir Zit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday, Elayan sent what was described as &quot;an
open letter&quot; to Israeli and world public opinion on the circumstances
of her unlawful arrest and detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The letter, excerpts of which were published by Wednesday's
Arabic press, said Elayan would continue her hunger strike, now entering
its 34 days, until either freedom or martyrdom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Entitled &quot;to all those willing to listen,&quot; the
letter pointed out that Elayan's detention was utterly illegal and that
the Israeli goal behind it was &quot;to break my will.. and that will never
happen.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elayan disclosed that Israeli interrogators had informed
her &quot;not to bank much on justice because all Israeli judged are inside
our rear pockets.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She added that &quot;I shall continue in my just hunger
strike until I earn my freedom, and even then, I shall continue to struggle
against this oppressive law that enables occupation soldiers to detain haphazardly
any Palestinian without charge or trial and for as long as seen fit by the
occupation authorities.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elayan added, rather ominously, that &quot;I am a committed
Muslim and my religious convictions are incompatible with suicide, but this
(hunger strike) is my only means in the face of those oppressors.&quot;

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA dismisses Netanyahu's initiative as &quot;just
another </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>evasive tactic&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (24 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority officials have rejected a reported
proposal by Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu to redeploy Israeli troops
from 6%-8% of area (C) in return for Palestinian consent to enter final
status talks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Abdul Rahman, Secretary-General of the PA ministerial
council, described the proposal as &quot;another evasive tactic aimed at
absolving Israel from carrying out commitments under the Oslo Accords.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking in Gaza, after a meeting of the PA cabinet and
the PLO executive committee, Abdul Rahman said the Palestinians rejected
the proposal outright, insisting on full implementation of the interim agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli proposal, reported by the Israeli media Sunday
night, stipulates also that the key and third phase of Israeli army redeployment
from the West Bank (except from settlements and military positions) be canceled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They want to lump interim and final status issues
so that at the end we would end up with a dismal deal,&quot; said Abdul
Rahman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu has sought to stall the second redeployment altogether
or reduce its scope to negligible proportions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier this year, Netanyahu suggested that the second
phase of redeployment covers 2%-3% of area (b) where Israel has &quot;security
responsibility&quot; and the PA &quot;civilian responsibility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with an ostensibly determined Palestinian rejection
of a token redeployment, and reportedly with growing American displeasure,
Netanyahu has been forced to come up with his new proposal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The proposal has a &quot;Zero probability&quot; of success,
since its acceptance by the Palestinians would amount to the &quot;undoing
of Oslo&quot; from the Palestinian perspective.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA logic has so far been that when Israel and the PA
embarked on the final status talks, the Palestinians would have significant
chunks of the West Bank, perhaps up to 80% of the total area of the West
Bank, under their control, thus strengthening their negotiating position.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Netanyahu faces a stiff opposition from some
of his key coalition partners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, Michael Kleiner, who heads the so-called &quot;land
of Israel front&quot; said his front would seek to topple the Netanyahu
government if he went ahead with his proposal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In the past months we have met with Netanyahu on
several occasions and warned him that if he crosses the red line we will
topple the government. We have nothing further to say to him.&quot; said
Kleiner in an interview with the Israeli press Monday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, National Religious Party leaders made similar
threats against Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yitzhak Levy, of the NRP, said &quot;his party would leave
the government if the IDF left the parts of the land of Israel they are
talking about.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Additional threats also came of Rahba'am Zeivi, head of
the ultra-right wing party, Moledet, which calls for the expulsion of Arabs
from Palestine to the Arabian Peninsula.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We will bring down the government if Netanyahu makes
good on his remarks on redeployment,&quot; Zeivi said in an interview with
the Israeli radio Monday morning .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli army bulldozers demolished
two Palestinian homes in the Bethlehem area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, the two homes (sheltering
two families) were destroyed allegedly because they were built without license.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians point out that Israeli refuse deliberately
to grant Palestinians building licenses in order to impede Arab demographic
growth, thus forcing Palestinians to build homes without licenses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The destruction by Israel of Palestinian homes has by far
been the second most callous and evil practice against Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If a Palestinian wants to express extreme condemnation,
he Says &quot;Yikhrib Beitak,&quot; may your home be destroyed.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>I<FONT SIZE=+2>sraeli army closes off Mosque to Muslims;
kills youth</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (22 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation troops shot and killed a Palestinian
Christian youth in early morning Saturday at an Israeli military roadblock
just outside Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said Israeli &quot;Border Police&quot;
soldiers opened fire automatic rifles at a car driven by Subhi Michael Kanawati
at the Israeli military roadblock just north of Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kanawati, son of a prominent Christian Arab clan, was killed
instantly, as Israeli bullets penetrated the back of his head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Family sources in Bethlehem said Kanawati was carrying
bread supplies to nearby grocery stores when his car came under a hail of
bullets from the Israeli garrison guarding the roadblock.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kanawati carried a Salvadoran passport, like many Palestinian
Christian Arabs who seek foreign passports as a means to ward off Israeli
persecution and harassment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli army spokesman said in a statement Saturday
afternoon Kanawati &quot;may have tried to run over an Israeli soldier manning
the roadblock.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement said &quot;soldiers opened fire at the vehicles'
tires, but one random bullet hit Kanawati in the head.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement ended with the routine phrase &quot;the incident
is being investigated.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the fatal shooting of Kanawati, clashes between
stone-throwing Palestinians, many of whom school children, and heavily armed
Israeli soldiers erupted in the vicinity of Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque (which
Jews call Rachel Tomb).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israelis used rubber bullets (actually metal bullets
with thin rubber coverings), and tear gas to quell Palestinian demonstrations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to eyewitnesses, several school children suffered
suffocation from gas-inhalation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In an unrelated development, a Palestinian youth died in
vague circumstances in the village of Rafat near Kalkilya when an explosion
ripped off his room Friday evening, 21 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Local sources identified the man as Badran Awadh Abu Asbeh,
25, who is a teacher and a graduate student at the Najah National University.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not clear yet what caused the explosion, but locals
surmise it was either an Israeli-executed assassination or an explosion
of an explosive device he was preparing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the explosion, Israeli troops cordoned off the
village and cut it off from the outside world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamist sources pointed out that it was &quot;highly likely
that the Israeli intelligence was standing behind the incident.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If true, this would portend the beginning of a new round
of bloody violence between Hamas and Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, the occupation authorities closed
off the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron to Muslim worshipers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The closure by the Israeli occupation authorities of the
Mosque to Muslims has assumed an increasingly recurrent pace, which raises
serious questions about Israeli intentions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday night, hundreds of Jewish settlers converged
on Hebron to celebrate a Jewish holiday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Arab sources, many of the settlers chanted
anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans, and some of them attacked Arab property
in the Hebron Old Town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are as many as 200 troublesome and fanatic settlers
living under round-the-clock military protection in the heart of Hebron
in the midst of 170,000 Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians say that very often, townspeople are held
hostage to the whims and &quot;security&quot; of the settlers, and are denied
freedom of movement within the city. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (20 November)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Jewish settler was killed and another injured in East
Jerusalem by unknown assailants believed to be Palestinian guerrillas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The incident occurred around midnight Wednesday near Areil
Sharon's home, not far from the walls of the Alaksa Mosque.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli police sources, the two settlers are
members of the extremist group known as &quot;Ateret Kuhanim&quot; which
seeks to obliterate the Arab-Islamic identity of East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources said bullets were fired from an automatic rifle,
instantly killing Gebrael Herch, 27, and seriously injuring another settler.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spot where the incident took place was cordoned off
and dozens of Arab youth were detained for questioning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Avigodor Kahlani, Minister of Internal Security, described
the incident as very serious because of the use of automatic fire arms.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kahlani said police presence would be beefed up throughout
East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister, who is facing a legitimacy crisis
within his own ruling Likud coalition, said a new police centre would be
established in the heart of the predominantly-Muslim area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's reaction to the incident was criticized by
the opposition Labor Party as &quot;hasty and unwise.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the Labour party said &quot;establishing
a police center in that area would create more problems than make solutions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spokesman, Ben Amy, accused Netanyahu of seeking &quot;to
distract attention from the serious problems he is facing within his own
party and coalition.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ateret Kuhanim has been very active in trying to purchase
(using deceitful tactics and tricks) Arab houses and real estate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure
Ariel Sharon presented to US officials on Wednesday what was described as
detailed maps of West Bank territories which Israel would keep in a final-status
arrangement with the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sharon was quoted by the English daily, the Jerusalem Post,
as saying that &quot;Israel must retain several security zones in the territories
in any final-status settlement.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli paper pointed out that among the zones to be
retained by Israel are the Jordan Rift Valley, east-west roads bisecting
the West Bank, water resources, in addition to existing Jewish settlements
which cover up to 60% of the area of the West Bank. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestine Islamists Condemn Egypt Tourist
Carnage</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (19 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Islamists have strongly condemned the 17 November
massacre of foreign tourists in Egypt, which claimed 67 victims, saying
the carnage &quot;was absolutely incompatible with the sublime teachings
of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas founder and principal leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yasin,
issued a statement denouncing the &quot;terrible killing as absolutely incompatible
with the sublime teachings of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement, released by Hamas information office in
Gaza on 18 November, said &quot;it was highly possible that suspicious and
strange hands were behind such crimes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the statement said Hamas rejected in the past
and rejects now attacks on foreigners visiting Muslim countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Hamed al Beitawi, widely considered the second most
prominent Palestinian Islamist figure after Yasin, also condemned the incident
in strong terms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This carnage contradicts diametrically Islamic ethics
and laws which prohibits the killing of innocent people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Beitawi quoted a Quranic verse to that effect: &quot;Thou
Shall not kill...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Beitawi, who is a high-ranking judge, said &quot;these
repugnant actions are un-Islamic and distort the image of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Hebron, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub strongly denounced the carnage,
saying &quot;these actions are totally unacceptable, first because they
are incompatible with the Sharia (Islamic law) and second because they besmirch
the image of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And like other Islamist leaders, Rajoub voiced doubts that
&quot;hostile elements may well be behind these actions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub, say his friends, is a very influential Islamic
leader in the southern part of the West Bank and his words carry a definite
weight. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Gaza, Sayyed Abu Musamih, a top Hamas leader, said Muslims
in Palestine as everywhere &quot;view with repugnance and disbelief the
killing of innocent people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said Hamas wanted to see &quot;a stable, strong and
prosperous Egypt because that would be beneficial for the collective interests
of Muslims.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Jihad movement also condemned the slaughter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The movement's spokesman, Abdullah al Shami, said the killing
of tourists contradicted the Islamic and humanist principles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic movement in Palestine, which is part of the
worldwide Muslim Brotherhood, generally rejects the use of violence to topple
secular regimes throughout the Muslim world. The rationale behind this stance
is that violence could result in more harm than good unto Muslims.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas-PA relations troubled again</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT ( 18 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It seems that Hamas relations with the Palestinian Authority
are destined to face another troublesome episode following what was described
as &quot;the conspiratorial hand-over&quot; on 13 November of two of two
Hamas' military wing's members to the Israeli authorities. The two, Jamal
al Hoor and Abdul Rahman Ghuneimat (both members of the reputed Surif cell
which Israel alleges was responsible for the killing of 10 Israeli soldiers
and civilians) were &quot;abducted&quot; in vague circumstances by a special
IDF unit on the outskirts of Nablus while being transferred from Hebron
to Nablus aboard a Preventive Security car.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to informed Palestinian sources, an Israeli agent
planted inside the PS, informed the Israelis of the planned transfer of
the Islamist guerrillas, enabling an IDF undercover unit to snatch al Hoor
and Ghuneimat just outside area (A) within which the PA has (or is supposed
to have) exclusive control. The head of the Israeli army central command
alluded to tacit cooperation with the PS in &quot;capturing the two terrorists.&quot;
In a prompt news conference, Maj. Gen. Uzi Dayan said an undercover unit
known as Duvedevan captured the two wanted Palestinians after receiving
&quot;information from a very special source.&quot; Dayan refused to elaborate
further, but observers here surmise that he may have meant a top Palestinian
security official.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When the news of the incident broke Friday morning, 14
November, Hamas immediately accused the PS of &quot;delivering our two fighters
to the hands of our enemy,&quot; adding rather ominously that &quot;you
will pay dearly for your treachery.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas' senior spokesman in Gaza, Abdul Aziz al Rantisi,
held the PA &quot;fully responsible for this disgraceful act of perfidy.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Whether it was an act of connivance, a manifest hand-over,
a tacit deal, or a criminal negligence resulting from Israeli informers
penetrating the PS, the PA is responsible and must pay for that,&quot; he
said in a telephone interview on 15 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Rantisi refused to say explicitly that the PA
did deliver the two Islamist guerrillas into the hands of the Shabak.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The relatively mild reactions from Gaza apparently were
not sufficient to calm-down the fury of West Bank, particularly Hebron,
Islamist leaders. And for the first time, Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yasin,
was criticized, though not harshly, for being &quot;too conciliatory toward
the PA.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We will not agree to sacrifice our own brothers for
the sake of an illusive national unity,&quot; said a furious relative of
Ibrahim Ghuneimat, during an angry demonstration in Hebron on 16 November
against the alleged handover. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The demonstrators, who came mainly from the village of
Surif to which the two guerrillas belong, lashed out at the PA as never
before, shouting slogans like &quot;Arafat is (Israeli) collaborator,&quot;
&quot;Jebril (PS chief Jebril Rajoub) is <B><I>jasus</I></B><I> </I>(spy),
and &quot;<B><I>sulta </I></B><I>(</I>PA) is an Israeli puppet.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We want to know what exactly happened, who were involved
in this treacherous act..was it a practical translation of security cooperation
between Rajoub and the Shabak,&quot; said Ahmed al Hoor, a relative of Jamal
al Hoor, before a crowd of more than a thousand demonstrators, along with
hundreds of PA security personnel who were looking on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that &quot;we warned him (Rajoub) against transferring
our brothers to Nablus because the Israelis were after them, but he refused
arrogantly to listen to us.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, hundreds of Surif villagers sought to force their
way into the PA headquarters in Hebron, demanding the &quot;release of Ibrahim
Ghuneimat (a third cell member still in PA detention in Hebron) and the
immediate resignation of Jebril Rajoub.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 18 November, Hamas military wing, the Izzidin al Kassam
Squads, distributed a leaflet in parts of the West Bank, vowing to &quot;respond
sooner rather than later to Rajoub's disgraceful act.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;our response will be human bombs against the Zionist
enemy,&quot; said the leaflet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet said &quot;the delivery of our brave fighters
to the enemy's hands was in implementation of security coordination and
cooperation with Israel...and a clear proof that the heads of PA security
agencies are merely representatives of the Israeli intelligence within the
autonomous enclaves.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the leaflet reiterated earlier charges that &quot;Rajoub
went ahead with the 'planned hand-over' despite unmistakable warnings from
the two activists themselves, their families, and Islamist leaders in the
West Bank.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly embarrassed by the affair, PA officials sought
to turn the heat on the Israeli government &quot;which always doesn't respect
agreements.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This act of piracy and thievery is indicative of
the entire behavior of the Israeli government,&quot; said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Ereikat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, PS chief Jebril Rajoub remained reticent
on the matter. On 16 November, following repeated requests for his reaction
to charges of a tacit handover of the two Hamas members, Rajoub instructed
his secretary to issue a laconic statement describing &quot;the charges
and rumors of a hand-over as silly and laughable.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement likened &quot;the act of piracy&quot; to
the Mossad's bungled assassination attempt on the life of Hamas chief Khalid
Masha'al in Amman last month. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the statement recognized that &quot;there may
have been a crack within our rank and file, enabling the Israelis to locate
the car and abduct the two detainees.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub has been lately exposed to a mounting criticisms
from fellow Fatah members who accused him of displaying &quot;scornful behavior
toward PA officials.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, his membership in Fatah's higher council, was
frozen for 45 days following the disclosure of a letter he had sent to fellow
member, Sakhre Habash, in which he reportedly called him &quot; a male prostitute.&quot;
The letter, say Fatah insiders, was only the latest in a series of scandalous
incidents in which he displayed &quot;bullying behaviors, brutality and
utter lack of civility&quot; towards junior and even some senior PA officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Palestinians continued to protest the continued
detention by Israel of Islamic Jihad activist Itaf Alliyan who was arrested
by Israeli soldiers at a roadblock while traveling from Bethlehem to Abu
Dis near Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Alliyan has been on a hunger strike ever since her detention
25 days ago, and Palestinian sources said her health &quot;is in real danger.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 11 November, Israeli soldiers protecting a Jewish religious
celebration outside the Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque (known by Jews as Rachel's
Tomb) shot and seriously wounded a 7-year-old child who was returning home
from school.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to witnesses, Ali al Jawarish, a first-grader,
waved his hand to an Israeli soldier whom he thought was photographing him.
The soldier, apparently a sniper, shot him in the head, causing irreparable
damage to his brain. Jawarish, who had been in a deep coma, died on 15 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli army spokesman said Israeli soldiers were trying
to quell Palestinian rioters when the child crossed into the line of fire.
The IDF statement was another shameless attempt to escape blame for killing
an innocent child on the ground that &quot;it was the child who hit the
bullet not the other way around.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jwarish family decided to donate their dead son's organs
for transplantation. His father, Muhammed Jawarish, said he didn't care
whether the organs would go to an Arab or a Jew. </FONT></P>

fighters to Israel</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT(15 November)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has accused the
Palestinian Authority of &quot;handing over&quot; to Israel two Islamist
fighters belonging to Hamas' military arm, the Izzidin al Kassam Brigades.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A leaflet signed by Hamas and distributed in the West Bank
on Saturday said the abduction Thursday night of Jamal al Hoor and Abdul
Rahman Ghuneimat by undercover Israeli soldiers was the result of &quot;unmistakable
connivance between the Israeli intelligence and the Palestinian Preventive
Security agency.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We have no doubts whatsoever that the Palestinian
Authority conspired with Israel to hand over our two brothers, al Hoor and
Ghuneimat, to the criminal hands of the Zionist enemy,&quot; said the leaflet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet pointed out that relatives of the two Islamist
guerrillas had warned PS Chief Jebril Rajoub against &quot;transferring
our sons to Nablus because the Israelis would get them.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub, the leaflet said, &quot;refused arrogantly to listen
to them and told them that he was going to transfer them from Hebron to
Nablus.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, the leaflet castigated the PA for &quot;continuing
to hold our brothers behind bars and commuting them on a daily bases from
one prison to the other, making them an easy target for Israeli roadblocks
and checkpoints.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The vague incident, which took place on the outskirts of
Nablus around midnight Thursday, also drew angry reactions from Hamas political
leadership in Gaza.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The movement's most senior spokesman, Dr. Abdul Aziz al
Rantisi, said in a telephone interview from his home in Gaza on Saturday
that &quot;what happened was either of two things: a simple handover of
our brothers to the Israelis or a serious penetration by the Israeli intelligence
of the rank and file of the Preventive Security.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I can't, we can't absolve the Palestinian Authority
from the responsibility for what happened...our brothers, after all, were
in their custody.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, the PA issued a statement describing the
incident as an &quot;act of piracy.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement said a unit of the Israeli army abducted
two members of Hamas military wing while they were being transferred aboard
an official Palestinian vehicle from Hebron to Nablus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement added that the abduction was &quot;a clear
violation of the Oslo Accords because the two detainees were in our custody.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Saeb Ureikat described
the incident as &quot;an act of piracy and gangsterism,&quot; but refused
to pin the blame on the Preventive Security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Hoor and Ghuneimat, both from the village of Surif near
Hebron, are members of the so-called &quot;Surif cell&quot; which is believed
to have been responsible for killing 11 Israeli soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Their abduction by Israeli troops is expected to cause
some strain to Hamas' relations with the PA.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Ex-Canadian ambassador to Israel: Ottawa
knew </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>about forged passports</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(12 November)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Former Canadian Ambassador to Israel Norman Spector claimed
on Wednesday that the Canadian government &quot;knew all along about the
use by Mossad agents of forged or doctored Canadian passports.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Spector, a Canadian Jew who is now president and publisher
of the Israel's main English daily, the Jerusalem Post, disclosed that Canada
and Israel had had &quot;extensive intelligence cooperation for quite a
long time,&quot; adding that &quot; members of the Canadian embassy in Tel
Aviv as well as Canadian security officials knew that Canadian passports
were being used by the Mossad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Spector was quoted by the <I>Post</I> as saying that &quot;the
reason they (the Canadians) didn't do anything about it is because of the
extensive security cooperation between the two countries.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He described Canada as a &quot;small player&quot; in the
international espionage game, pointing out that Canadian and Israeli intelligence
services had a working relationship based on the &quot;give-and-take principle.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;You have to pay for this kind of thing, and therefore
Canada had to get into barter arrangements in its dealings with the Mossad,&quot;
Spector reportedly said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who has just
wrapped up a visit to Israel, denied &quot;the allegations&quot; made by
Spector.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Axworthy described as &quot;just untrue&quot; news reports
that the Canadian authorities had given implicit permission for its travel
documents to be used by the Mossad agents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, the Canadian foreign minister received &quot;assurances&quot;
from his Israeli counterpart, David Levy, and later from Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu, that Israel would never again use Canadian passports
as part of their cover during clandestine and assassination operation such
as the one that targeted Hamas political chief in Amman Khaled Masha'al
six weeks ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to a former Mossad agent who had fled to Canada,
the Mossad uses &quot;hundreds of forged and doctored Canadian, American,
European and South American passports to cover their operations in the Arab
world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More recently, however, reliable sources have intimated
that the Mossad has begun using forged &quot;Turkish, Jordanian and even
Jordanian passports.&quot; <BR>

</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>operation&quot; in the heart of Tel Aviv</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (10 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Jihad organization warned Israel on Monday
that it would carry out &quot;a martyrdom operation in the heart of Tel
Aviv&quot; if the Jewish state continued to detain a movement activist whom
Israeli soldiers abducted two weeks ago while traveling from Bethlehem to
Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A person claiming to represent the Islamic Jihad told journalists
in Bethlehem that &quot;we warn the Israeli state that we will launch a
martyrdom operation in the heart of Tel Aviv if sister Itaf Illayan is not
released in the next few days.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Illayan was re-arrested three weeks ago by Israeli soldiers
manning a roadblock on the Wadi al Nar street which circumvents Jerusalem
and links the southern and northern parts of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Illayan had been released from Israeli prisons in February
in the context of an agreement with the PA, after spending five years in
Zionist detention. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ever since here re-detention 19 days ago, Illayan has been
on a hunger strike and Red Cross officials say her health &quot;is in real
danger.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, Palestinian demonstrators hurled stones at Israeli
soldiers in the vicinity of the Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque in Bethlehem in protest
against Illayan's continued incarceration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said several Palestinians were injured
of Israeli rubber bullets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, an prominent Islamist leader has
urged the PA to &quot;terminate this mockery known as the peace process.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Nayef Rajoub told thousands of Hamas supporters,
who gathered at the Hebron University campus to celebrate the release from
Israeli detention of Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, that &quot;the so-called peace
process has become like gallows for the Palestinian people and the Palestinian
cause.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub said it was totally absurd to continue in &quot;this
mockery&quot; at a time when the construction of Jewish colonies in the
West Bank continues unceasingly and when the Zionist are even plotting to
demolish the Al Aksa Mosque.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Rajoub urged the PA and all Arab and Muslim
states to boycott the upcoming Doha economic conference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub said the Zionists had always harbored three designs
against the Muslim peoples: To ingather as many Jews as possible into Palestine
and to expel as many Palestinians as possible; to achieve absolute military
superiority all Arab and Muslim states, adding that they have been able
to achieve these two goals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The third goal, Rajoub said, was to achieve &quot;political,
economic and cultural hegemony&quot; in the region, saying the Zionists
hope to achieve this insidious goal through normalization and joint economic
ventures such as the Doha conference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More to the point, the Islamist leader appealed to all
Muslims not to capitulate to Zionist designs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;For the sake of al Masjidul Aksa, for the sake Palestine
and its Muslim people, we call on Arab and Muslim countries to shun the
Doha conference...this is the least you should do for Palestine,&quot; he
said.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA Sources: Israeli army escalated encroachment
on area &quot;A&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT (9 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli army has escalated raids and forays into PA-held
towns in the West Bank in blunt violation of the Oslo Accords, Palestinian
sources said Sunday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron Police Chief Tareq Zeid said Israeli penetration
(by soldiers and settlers) of (H-1), those parts of Hebron administered
by the PA, has become a recurrent and &quot;almost a daily phenomenon.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This week alone, Israeli soldiers and settlers encroached
on our area three times for the clear purpose of provoking Palestinians
into throwing stones at them forcing the Israeli soldiers in turn to reinvade
the area under our control,&quot; said Zeid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Saturday night, hundreds of Jewish settlers rioted along
the <I>Shallala street</I>, referred to half-jokingly by local Palestinians
as the &quot;armistice line,&quot; shouting anti-Arab slogans and demanding
the Israeli government &quot;to retake Hebron, the city of our forefathers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The settlers, who demonstrated and went on the rampage
in the full view of regular Israeli army soldiers, also shouted &quot;We
don't want to be confined to a ghetto.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, the heavily armed settlers
attacked a Palestinian policeman with stones, causing him a grave injury
in the head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The recurrent penetration of settlers and undercover Israeli
soldiers is being met with mounting Palestinian exasperation with what one
Palestinian called &quot;the utter futility and nonsense of the h-1- h-2-division.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Look, they are making mockery of our 'sovereignty'
within our area...they (Israeli soldiers and settlers) violate the agreement
almost on a daily basis and we still claim that Hebron is liberated,&quot;
marveled a downtown Hebron shopkeeper who opted for anonymity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zeid concurred, though with an ameliorated tone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These encroachments are not happening incidentally.
They are manifestations of a deliberate Israeli policy aimed at dismantling
the Hebron agreement and reoccupying the town,&quot; said Zeid, recalling
a recent statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu not ruling
out the possibility of IDF retaking Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hebron Police chief added that &quot;in order for these
provocative acts to stop, a political decision from the Israeli government
is needed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When asked if he saw that decision forthcoming, he didn't
hesitate to say &quot;not at all.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron, is not the only place where encroachments on PA-administered
territory are carried out by the Israeli army and its under-cover units.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources point out that Israeli soldiers disguising
themselves as Arabs have been carrying out nightly raids on homes of Islamic
activists in many localities where the PA is supposed to be in full or partial
control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Three months ago, an Israeli army under-cover unit raided
the PA-controlled town of Tulkarm, abducting an Islamic Jihad activist in
full daylight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Similar incidents also took place in Bethlehem, Nablus,
Bani Naeim and Dura.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two years ago, When PA Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in
the West Bank, he declared each town that was handed over to the PA &quot;liberated,
liberated, liberated.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, in light of recurrent Israeli army and settlers' forced
reentry into these towns, many Palestinians have come to view Arafat's proclamations
merely as &quot;lamentable rhetorical overindulgence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (8 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat has described
the latest round of talks with Israel in Washington as &quot;futile, barren
and useless.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking in Gaza Saturday upon returning from Gabon, where
he attended the a conference of the French-speaking countries , Arafat said
the Washington talks was &quot;a clear failure as we had expected because
Israel possesses neither the will nor the inclination to achieve progress
on the substantive issues.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the PA Chairman reiterated earlier charges that
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy had gone to Washington without clear
authorization from Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to discuss &quot;executive
matters.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, the PA will make a &quot;comprehensive
review&quot; of all aspects pertaining to the talks with Israel, especially
in light of the &quot;fiasco&quot; in Washington and recent Israeli decisions
to build thousands of new housing units in Jewish colonies throughout the
West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chief Palestinian negotiator, Sa'eb Ureikat, said a comprehensive
review of the talks with Israel had become &quot;a pressing necessity so
that we won't continue to rotate in an empty circle.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat's and Ureikat's statements, observers say, underscore
the depth of Palestinian frustration vis-a-vis Israeli equivocation and
American reluctance to deal decisively with it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, Netanyahu was quoted as saying &quot;Israel
would not make free concessions to the Palestinians,&quot; adding that the
Jewish state would like to know beforehand what concessions the Palestinians
would be willing to offer in return for the so-called &quot;time-out&quot;
from settlement construction in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli soldiers, acting as pirates,
kidnapped a Palestinian college student while traveling between Bethlehem
and Hebron in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The student, Hani Abu Sba'a, was reportedly arrested when
the car he was riding was stopped at an Israeli army roadblock on the rugged
Wadi al Nar road that circumvents Jerusalem which is off-limit to Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two weeks ago, Israeli soldiers stationing in the same
area reasserted Itaf Ilayan, a 35-years old Palestinian woman prisoner who
had been freed Last February in the context of an agreement between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ilayan was reportedly sent to a detention camp, without
charge or trial, where she started an open-ended hunger strike to protest
her flagrant detention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Family sources said Ilayan's health had deteriorated and
was transferred to the military hospital in Ramle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli occupation army controls all roads linking
West Bank towns and villages and often erects abrupt roadblocks and checkpoints
on these roads to &quot;catch&quot; Palestinian activists considered &quot;outspoken
opponents of the occupation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (6 November) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After three days of intensive talks between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators in Washington under American aegis, the Palestinian
Authority has declared the talks &quot;a complete failure.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Abdul Rahman, Secretary-General of the PA administrative
council, said Thursday the talks &quot;produced absolutely nothing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;There was no progress on any of the outstanding issues.
This is what we had expected and this is what happened.&quot; Abudul Rahman
said in an interview with the &quot;Voice of Palestine,&quot; the official
media organ of the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Rahman accused the American administration of &quot;not
putting up real efforts to force Israel to abide by the terms of the agreements.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The Americans would like us to talk and talk and
talk, but would not take any action that would force Israel to stop its
settlement exapasnion in the West Bank and to carry out the long-overdue
redeployment of the Israeli army from our land,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Abdul Rahman accused the Clinton administration
of &quot;malicious intent.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They could, if they wanted, put an end to Israeli
intransigence and insolence, but they just continue to display what amounts
to be connivance with Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, the Israeli occupation authorities
have confiscated hundreds of donums belonging to Arab peasants and farmers
at the hamlet of al Burj, 32 kilometers west off Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources pointed out that Israeli soldiers and
settlers rooted out hundreds of olive trees belonging to two Palestinian
farmers, Ahmed Ismael Itbish and Ayed Shadid, at Um al Shugfan, near the
village of al Burj, which is located at the 1948 armistice line.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Israeli sources had reported that Jewish settlers
were planning to build a settlement in the area for the purpose of &quot;obliterating
the armistice line and making it impossible for future Israeli governments
to cede land to the Palestinians.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Exercise of futility</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT( 4 November)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even before Palestinian negotiators set out for Washington
on 3 November for yet a new round of talks with Israeli officials under
the direct aegis of US Secretary of state Madeleine Albright, PA officials,
including Yasser Arafat, had already predicted that the talks would be a
failure. Arafat, departing from his usual &quot;optimistic&quot; tone, told
the Israeli Hebrew daily Ma'ariv on 2 November he saw very little chance
that the talks would breed genuine results &quot;because Netanyahu is negotiating
for the sake of negotiation and that he is sending (Foreign Minister) David
Levy without authorization to make decisions.&quot; However, when asked
why he had decided to send his delegation to the talks despite the likelihood
that they would fail, he said &quot;we received an invitation from (US Secretary
of State Madeleine) Albright, and we accepted the invitation.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other Palestinian officials were even more pessimistic
in their forecasts. Yasser Abed Rabbu, who holds the Culture and Information
portfolio in the PA administration, anticipated that the talks would be
&quot;just a waste of time.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These talks will produce nothing because the present
Israeli government is not interested in implementing the agreements we had
signed with the previous Israeli government, they (the Netanyahu government)
playing stalling tactics in order to create more facts on the ground and
to frustrate us into making still more concessions to them,&quot; Abed Rabbu
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, given Palestinian pessimism, the main reason prompting
the Palestinians to send its team to the Washington talks was to please
the Americans and ward off possible charges that the Palestinians, not the
Israelis, were creating obstacles. So, by seeking to win &quot;the public
relations strife&quot; with Netanyahu, the PA hopes to be able to swing
the ball back to the Israeli court, having been strongly thrown into the
Palestinian arena following the two suicidal bomb attacks in Jerusalem in
late July and early September. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, despite everything, the American administration
was still not satisfied with what was described as &quot;the inadequate
size of the Palestinian delegation.&quot; So, eventually Secretary of State
Albright exerted pressure on the PA to send more negotiators to the talks
in order to broaden the agenda of the talks. This was viewed as a significant
Palestinian concession since the Israeli government had always suggested
that substantive issues ( e.g. settlement expansion and secondary and tertiary
redeployment) and procedural issues such as the sea and air ports in Gaza
be lumped together. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly, the underlying reason behind this Israeli stance
is to try to bamboozle the Palestinians into accepting a deal whereby they
would resign to delaying or even canceling Israeli army redeployment from
areas (B+C) and only a symbolic &quot;time-out&quot; from settlement expansion
in return for a modicum of progress on the symptomatic procedural issues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, this stance was spelled out by Prime Minister
Netanyahu several times before Levy's departure for Washington. Netanyahu
said he &quot; would hand out any more land to the Palestinians without
knowing in advance how the features of the final status settlement would
look like.&quot; Obviously, the Israeli premier believes that if the Palestinians
were enabled to make substantial gains, e.g. receiving a significant chunk
of the West Bank, their negotiating position would be made stronger in the
final status talks. Hence his reported instructions to Levy no to delve
deeply into the redeployment and settlement expansion issues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For their part, the Palestinians, at least ostensibly,
refuse the deliberate Israeli accentuation of insubstantative issues, rightly
considering that as &quot;a sly ruse to evade carrying out Israeli army
redeployment form parts of the West Bank designated in the agreements we
had signed.&quot; More to the point, the Israeli point out that the display
by Israeli of sudden enthusiasm for reaching a concordance on the interim
issues (the sea and air ports in Gaza) is misleading since over an entire
year of intermittent negotiations on these issues has lapsed without making
any tangible progress thanks to Israeli intransigence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With the Palestinians budging, though begrudgingly, to
American demands to dispatch the heads of Joint Israeli-Palestinian committees
to the Washington talks, the PA hopes the Clinton administration will eventually
move to check Netanyahu's insolence in the West Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA seems to be fairly encouraged that recent remarks
attributed to Secretary Albright, in which she reportedly lambasted Netanyahu
for repeatedly deceiving the Americans, would signal the beginning of a
new tougher American approach toward Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another source of PA encouragement is the reported American
satisfaction with PA efforts to &quot;combat terrorism.&quot; Last week,
Preventive Security Chief Jebril Rajoub visited Washington and reportedly
briefed Congressmen and CIA officials on measures taken so far against Hamas
and the Islamic Jihad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Never the less, even if the PA succeeded in returning the
ball back to the Israeli court, this would be no guarantee that the US would
exert sufficient pressure on the Netanyahu government to force it to, e.g.
abide by the letter and spirit of the Oslo Accords. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>alternatives</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Aware of the dim prospects of the Washington talks, the
PA is exploring other alternatives. These include seeking to further mobilize
the European Union to get more involved, going back to the UN General Assembly,
unilaterally declaring the establishment of the State of Palestine, and,
not unlikely, seeking to reignite the intifada in cooperation with Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The formal declaration of a state, say PA insiders, has
lately become on the top of the Palestinian list of &quot;emergency alternatives.&quot;
A close aide to PA chairman Yasser Arafat intimated last week that &quot;if
Netanyahu continued pursuing his malicious policies and the US continued
its passive connivance with him, Abu Ammar (Arafat) would formally declare
the establishment of the State of Palestine.&quot; </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Official: Washington talks waste
of time</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (3/11/1997)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A prominent Palestinian Authority official has described
the current Washington talks between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
as &quot;a waste of time.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These talks will produce nothing because the present
Israeli government is not interested in implementing the agreements we had
signed with the previous government,&quot; said Yaser Abed Rabbu who assumes
the culture and information portfolio in the Palestinian autonomy administration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abed Rabbu revealed that the PA agreed to dispatch a delegation
to Washington &quot;only to please the Americans and to ward off charges
that the Palestinians are the party that is creating obstacles,&quot; he
said </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA Chairman Yaser Arafat likewise expressed profound pessimism
at the prospects of the Washington talks' outcome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat told the Israeli Hebrew daily <I>ma'ariv</I> Sunday
that he saw little chance that the talks would breed genuine results.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
of sending his foreign minister to Washington without authority to make
decisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, when asked why he decided to send a delegation
to Washington despite the negative atmosphere, the PLO chairman said &quot;we
received an invitation from (US Secretary of State Madeleine) Albright,
and we accepted the invitation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Observers here contend that the PA decision to go to Washington
despite Netanyahu's perceived ill-will was meant to the ball into the Israeli
court.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the PA believes there are good chances that they
will succeed this time in what has largely become a sort of public relations
struggle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA officials point out to recent statements by Albright
before a conference of American Jewish leaders in which she reportedly lashed
out at Netanyahu for trying to trick the American administration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Added to that is the reported American satisfaction at
PA efforts to &quot;combat terrorism,&quot; a clear reference to the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad organizations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, Preventive Security Chief Jebril Rajoub visited
Washington and reportedly briefed Congressmen and CIA officials on measures
taken so far against Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Never the less, even if the PA succeeds in returning the
ball to the Israeli court, this is no guarantee that the US administration
will exert real pressure on Netanyahu or, indeed, force the extremist Israeli
premier to reconsider his expansionist policies in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In light, the main and perhaps the only alternative remaining
available for the Palestinians is to initiate a genuine Arab-Muslim and
international campaign that would persuade the Clinton administration that
American interests would be seriously endangered if current American acquiescence
and connivance with Israel continued. </FONT></P>
