<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Islamist leaders hope a million Muslims will</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>take part in the &quot;al Quds in danger&quot;
contest</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Islamist
leaders from the 1948 Occupied Palestine are planning to hold a worldwide
contest aimed at increasing Muslim awareness of the dangers besetting Jerusalem
and Islamic Holy shrines therein, Palestinian sources said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ra'ed Salah, leader of the Islamic Movement in the
1948 Occupied Palestine and mayor of the Arab town of Um al Fahem, said
he hoped that a million Muslims would take part in the contest which he
said was aimed at &quot;making Muslims around the world well aware of the
looming dangers facing Jerusalem and Islamic and Christian holy places.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We have one al Quds, and one Aqsa, and if Israel
succeeds, God forbid, in making them disappear, then no Muslim would have
the audacity to view himself or herself in the mirror,&quot; said Salah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said he got the idea of the contest, which would
have &quot;al Quds in danger&quot; as the main slogan, after several visits
he had made to the Islamic Shrines in Jerusalem and seeing the continuing
digging by the Israeli authorities beneath al Masjidul Aqsa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said he was hopeful that there would be an overwhelming
Islamic response, especially from ordinary Muslims &quot;who do care about
Jerusalem and the frantic Israeli Jewish campaign to obliterate its Islamic
identity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, the steering committee of the contest has contacted
several prominent Muslim leaders and scholars who expressed their willingness
and desire to take part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several Islamic thinkers have already expressed enthusiasm
for the grand scheme including Mustafa Mash-hur, leader of the Ikhwan al
Muslimun (Muslim Brotherhood) movement in Egypt, Abu al Hasan al Nadawi
of India (a prominent Islamic thinker and scholar), Sheikh Yousef al Qardawi,
Dr. Abdul Fattah al Uweisi, Kamel al Shrif of Jordan, Rashed al Ghannoushi
of Tunisia, and Hamed Beitawi of Palestine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the steering committee, contacts are being
made with Sheikh Muhammed Hussein Fadlulah and Muhammed Mahdi Shamsuddin
of Lebanon, and several prominent Iranian, Saudi, Pakistani and Turkish
Islamist scholars and leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mustafa Mash-hur was quoted in the Islamist weekly Saut
al Haq wal Hurriya (Voice of Truth and Freedom) on 12 December as saying,
&quot;It is imperative for all Muslims to demonstrate that our holy places
are not cheap and easy targets for desecration and destruction.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu al Hasan al Nadawi, one of the most prominent Islamic
thinkers in India and the world at large, urged &quot;the Umma in the four
corners of the world to rally behind Jerusalem and not let the Jews repeat
what happened at Ayodia&quot;, when Hindu militants destroyed a historical
Islamic Shrine several years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah said the contest would, God willing, awaken Muslims
to the dangers and perils surrounding al Masjidul Aqsa.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The time for sleep is gone...so wake up Muslims!
before it is too late because your first Qibla and third Holiest Mosque
is in danger,&quot; Salah said.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas gains in student elections</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) continued to make
gains in college elections throughout the occupied territories. Last week,
the Islamic block received 40 seats out of the 81-seat-student assembly
in the Student Council election at the Najah national university in Nablus.
The Shabiba (Fatah) block received 35 seats, the Popular Front (PFLP) 4,
the Democratic Front (DFLP) 1 and the Communist party 1. The Najah University
had always been a bastion for PLO support, but in the past few years, especially
since the advent of the Palestinian Authority, the Islamists have been able
to establish themselves as the &quot;largest student block&quot; at the
college. Moreover, Hamas supporters are expected to win at the student election
at the Islamic University in Gaza, a traditional &quot;home turf&quot; for
the Islamists. Recent opinion polls in the occupied territories have shown
a slight increase in Hamas popularity. A PA-funded Opinion Survey Center
in Nablus put Hamas support at 10% and Fatah at 35%. However, results as
such can't be considered purely empirical as they often reflect tendentious
goals serving the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other developments, Israeli army bulldozers demolished
four Palestinian homes at Asira al Shamaliyya on Monday, 15 December. Palestinian
sources said the Israeli army placed the village and surrounding areas under
curfew before carrying out the demolition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The four homes belonged to the families of Palestinian
suicide-bombers involved in the two suicide bomb attacks in West Jerusalem
early this summer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights organizations had appealed to the Israeli
authority to cancel the &quot;demolition order&quot; on the grounds that
the families, including as many as 30 men, women and children, were innocent
victims. Moreover, it was argued that the Israeli policy of home demolition
proved ineffective against Palestinian resistance of Israeli occupation.
The demolition of Arab homes (the IDF does not demolish homes of Jews involved
in murdering Palestinians) has been an established Israeli policy since
Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli settlers destroy Mosque, soldiers
raid Journalist's home</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Israeli
settlers demolished a Mosque at the Arab village of Um Faraj near Akka on
4 December, Palestinian sources said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ra'ed Salah, head of the Islamist movement across
theGreen Line (pre-1967 Palestine) said Jewish settlers from a Kibbutz called
&quot;Bne Ami&quot; brought a bulldozer on Thursday to demolish the Mosque
which was built in 1934.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Eyewitnesses said the settlers embarked on their crime
under the cover of night and, consequently, the demolition could not have
been filmed or photographed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah expressed profound outrage at the &quot;evil act,&quot;
saying &quot;the destruction of the houses of worship is a red line everywhere
except in Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He pointed out that the destruction of the Um-al Faraj
Mosque was the latest incident in a series of attacks on and desecration
of Muslim holy sites throughout the country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He cited the unearthing by bulldozers of several ancient
Muslim cemeteries and the desecration of numerous mosques &quot;from Beir
al Sabah in the south to Safad in the north.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salah pointed out that in Safad alone, the Israeli authorities
have destroyed 17 mosques since 1948, leaving only a small mosque and minaret
intact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Salah, other mosques have been turned into
&quot;dens for drug addicts, gambling houses, and places of ill repute.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the al Aqsa Committee, an Islamic society
dedicated to the protection of Muslim holy places, lamented the destruction
of the Mosque at Um Faraj by the Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It reminds me of the destruction of Jewish synagogues
by the Nazis in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s...now the former victims are
doing the same thing to us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other developments, scores of Israeli soldiers raided
the home of Naim Tubasi, head of the Palestinian Journalists Union, in Ramallah
on 4 December.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Tubasi's son, Ibrahim, as many as 30 Israeli
soldiers stormed the house, located on Ramallah's southern outskirts, around
1:30 in the morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They pounded savagely on the outer door, terrorizing
the entire family...then they made their way to my father's small library,
inquiring about his possession of certain books critical of the Israeli
occupation and of Zionism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The raid on Tubasi's home has been condemned by the Palestinian
Legislative Council and human rights organizations in the Occupied Territories.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>PT staff- </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Itaf Elyan went on a hunger strike in protest against her
so-called &quot;administrative detention&quot;. She was released along with
other inmates a few months ago. Shobak officials claimed she was a &quot;threat
to security&quot; because she was an activist on behalf of the Al Jihad
Al Islami party. No other formal charges had been brought against her other
than her association with Al Jihad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ms. Elyan was able to gain worldwide sympathy and draw
the attention of the international public to the injustice she has been
suffering since her release from detention after spending 8 years out of
her 14-year sentence. Hers is just one of the many similar cases in which
Palestinian citizens are held in custody for no particular reason except
the whim of Shobak leaders. Prisoners are often detained without being charged
or tried and remain in detention for lengthy periods of time. Some inmates
have stayed for as many as five years in this state of injustice. The main
obstacle facing the detainee lawyers is the fact that the Shobak officials
get to have the final say regarding the release order, not the courts. Therefore,
appeals for release submitted to the courts by the lawyers on behalf of
their clients are &quot;just a waste of time&quot;, as one prisoner described
the process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This blatant violation of one of the basic human rights
as stated in the International Declaration for Human Rights articles (2),
(9) and (10) has been a recurrent process prevalent in the Jewish State.
The prisoners in Israeli jails undergo ill treatment, including incarceration
without charge and then being subjected to inhumane treatment and bad prison
conditions. In an attempt to improve their prison conditions (better food
and health care), prisoners have been known to resort to hunger strikes.
In many cases, they would be punished for their efforts by being put in
solitary confinement and/or forbidden from receiving family visits. The
prisoners are also subjected to various methods of torture and ill treatment
during interrogation sessions. The Israeli Government has renewed, at regular
intervals, the authorization to use harsher methods of interrogation in
&quot;exceptional cases&quot;; these methods include violent shaking, abusive
body positioning, beatings, hooding and sleep deprivation. Not surprisingly,
such methods have been precursors to the deaths of many prisoners-45 in
the past seven years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Taking into consideration that the number of political
detainees is around 3,648 (according to a recent Human Rights Watch report),
the problem is obvious. The Israeli Government has not complied with the
Fourth Geneva Convention article (76), which requires that protected persons
be held in the territories under occupation. Prior to redeployment, the
Israeli Government transferred thousands of prisoners and detainees to facilities
inside Israel and has abducted, in several cases, Palestinian citizens from
Palestinian Authority territories because they were &quot;wanted&quot; in
Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As Israel continues its inhumane policy towards the Palestinians
by violating their basic human rights, degrading their humanity and taking
every measure possible to prevent them from getting or even claiming any
rights, talk of a lasting peace settlement is no more than a big lie and
deception, since building peace needs trust and good intentions (which are
clearly not present). The most important point that one should realize is
that peace will not survive in an atmosphere of oppression and suppression.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians help Lebanese girl injured by
Israelis</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Special to PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Relations between Palestinians and Shiites in Lebanon have
not always been positive. Over the past decade, thousands of Palestinians
were killed defending their refugee camps in Lebanon by Shiite soldiers
led by Nabi Berri and the Amal militia. Many Shiite Lebanese in the south
blame many of their problems with the Israeli &quot;scorched earth policy&quot;
on the provocative behaviour of armed Palestinian resistance groups there.
Despite these divisions, a recent case of a Lebanese Shiite girl being treated
in the U.S. by a Palestinian-American relief group has shown that the problems
between the two communities are in the past and that a new relationship
based on mutual cooperation and respect can emerge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>16-year-old Miri Zeineddin does not know the politics of
her community well. Brought up in the small village of Safat Batik near
the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, what she does know about is
war and suffering. As a small child, she watched in horror as an Israeli
officer pulled a gun and shot to death her father in front of her home.
There had been an attack on an IDF patrol, and it seems the murder of Miri's
father was an act of revenge. This was just the start of the young girl's
nightmare. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In April 1996, Miri and her family were fortunate to escape
alive from the Israeli war machine's invasion of South Lebanon. The &quot;Grapes
of Wrath&quot; attacks in Lebanon left over 100 Lebanese civilians dead
and many more injured. &quot;We were lucky to not suffer the same fate as
Qana,&quot; Miri recalls. Qana is where the Israelis killed over 100 women
and children seeking refuge in a United Nations post. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the Qana massacre, a monitoring team was set
up by the French and U.S. to ensure that Israelis and Hizbollah, the Shiite
resistance movement fighting Israeli occupation in the south, did not attack
civilian targets. For six months following Qana the people in South Lebanon
were spared the usual bombings and attacks by Israeli artillery, warplanes
and soldiers. In August 1996, however, several Israeli shells hit the home
of Miri and her family in Safat Batik. It was the first cease-fire violation
since Qana.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I had just come home from school,&quot; the young
girl recalls, &quot;when the first shell hit. It blew off our roof and part
of the wall fell on me.&quot; Relatives quickly dug Miri out and took her
to a hospital, where doctors had to amputate her leg above the knee. &quot;I
am lucky,&quot; Miri says. &quot;Our home was hit again just after the people
had taken me from the rubble. Another minute and I would have been hit again
and killed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Enter the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, a non-political,
non-profit U.S.-based relief group that arranges free medical care in the
U.S. for injured Arab children who cannot be treated in the Middle East.
It was set up by a group of concerned Americans who wanted to help relieve
some of the great suffering Arab children endure in war-torn Lebanon and
occupied Palestine. &quot;We do not discriminate against any child in need
of our help,&quot; says PCRF treasurer Farid El-Asmar, who lives in New
Jersey. &quot;We have helped kids not only from Palestine, but also from
Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. It is an honour as Palestinians to give
something back to these people, instead of always taking or needing their
help.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In October 1997, Miri flew to the U.S. for a quality artificial
leg built at the Shriners Hospital in the U.S. The PCRF took care of her
ticket and all expenses for her travel and are housing her with a local
Palestinian family in Philadelphia. &quot;We do not think of Miri as Shiite
or Lebanese,&quot; explains Nizar Al-Warasneh, who has opened his apartment
to take care of the girl he never met before. &quot;It is a duty as a human
being to help these kids. They are suffering the same in Lebanon like we
are suffering in Palestine, and we have to help them whenever we can. It
is the right thing to do.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Miri is currently having a new leg built in the U.S. and
is happy to have the chance to walk again. While Nizar and his wife Samia
have opened their home and hearts for this girl, they hope that others will
see their work as an example and do the same for other children in need.
&quot;There are so many suffering Arab children throughout the Middle East,&quot;
says Nizar. &quot;We need more people to work with the PCRF to help house
and take care of those kids. It is our duty as Palestinians and as human
beings.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Political prisoners go on hunger strike in
PA jail</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (17 December)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>
- Scores of Palestinian political detainees have started a hunger strike
at the PA lockup in Dahairiyya, 20 kilometres west of Hebron, Palestinian
sources said on 17 December.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The usually reliable sources said the mostly Islamist detainees
decided to go on a hunger strike after the prison administration failed
to make good on a promise that had been made to the detainees to charge
them or release them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most of the detainees on the hunger strike are reportedly
from the Nablus area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources revealed a partial list of the detainees,
including Eyad Marwan, Sami Jabarin, Ala'a Humeidan, Ra'ed Kukah and Fahim
Dawabshe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The above-mentioned were rounded up by various PA security
agencies following the two bomb attacks in West Jerusalem last summer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The detainees reportedly included a number of pro-Hamas
students studying at the Najah National University in Nablus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other developments, the PA (mukhabarat) Intelligence
Service has been interrogating leaders of the teachers' union in the West
Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to a source close to the union, the interrogation
centred on their role in a teachers' strike earlier this year protesting
teachers' low salaries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity,
said PA interrogators accused the teachers of &quot;mixing education with
politics and of having been politically motivated&quot; in the said crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The source added that a security file was opened for each
teacher participating in the strike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The teachers' union is an elected body representing more
than 1,500 teachers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An average Palestinian teacher receives a monthly salary
not exceeding $300.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem - PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli army bulldozers demolished four Palestinian homes
at the village of Asira al Shamaliya near Nablus in the West Bank on 15
December.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian and Israeli sources said the Israeli army imposed
a military curfew on the village at dawn Monday 15 December, declaring the
area a closed military zone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The four homes belong to families of Palestinians suspected
of having carried out the two bomb attacks in West Jerusalem earlier last
summer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said that as many as 30 men, women
and children became homeless as a result of the callous Israeli act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, human rights organizations sought to cancel the
Israeli decision to destroy the four homes on the basis of the fact that
the victims (the now-homeless inhabitants) were being punished for crimes
they neither committed nor knew of or about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, it was argued that the destruction of Palestinian
homes proved no deterrent to Palestinian resistance to the evil Israeli
occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The demolition of Arab homes has been an established Israeli
policy since the occupation of the West Bank by Israel in 1967.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel routinely uses &quot;collective punishment&quot;
against the Palestinian population.</FONT></P>

Farakhan accused the Zionist-controlled media of &quot;seeking deliberately
to distort my statements and views because they don't like the issues I
raise in my speeches.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They and those who stand behind them don't like the
issues I adopt such as human equality and opposition to exploitation of
man by fellow man, and opposition to oppression, occupation and all sorts
of injustices.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farakhan canceled a scheduled visit to the al Aqsa Mosque
where he was supposed to perform noon prayers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government, which was taken by surprise by
the visit, didn't welcome Farrakhan's visit to Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>David Bar-Ellan, head of the planning department at the
Prime Minister's Office, vilified Farakhan as &quot;hater of Israel and
the Jewish people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bar-Ellan said Farakhan was not to be welcomed in Israel,
adding, however, that as an American citizen, he was entitled to visit as
a tourist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farakhan is anathema to the Zionist circles in the United
States. His repeated accusations that Jews played a significant role in
the slave trade drew indignant reactions from Jewish leaders, who in turn
accused him of being anti-Semitic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On many occasions, Farakhan labeled the ready charge of
&quot;anti-Semitism&quot; as &quot;a sword of terror in the face of truth.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 14 December, Farakhan met with Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farakhan was quoted as saying that the peace process wouldn't
succeed if it didn't enable the Palestinians to restore their legitimate
rights, especially the right to return to their homeland from which they
were expelled by the Zionists in 1948.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu: No further redeployment until
</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA accepts our conditions for final-status
settlement</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has vowed that
&quot;Israel will not carry out any further redeployment in the West Bank
until the Palestinians accept our conditions for the final settlement.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking during a television interview on 21 December,
Netanyahu said his Government would not transfer any more territories to
the Palestinian Authority until &quot;we know the features of the final
settlements beforehand and the Palestinians accept our conditions for the
final settlement.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the PA would have to carry out all its commitments
stipulated in the Oslo Accords before Israel could start carrying out the
second phase of redeployment from parts of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's remarks are considered the clearest signs so
far that the present Israeli Government will not comply with the stipulations
of the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Accords originally envisaged a three-phase Israeli
redeployment from the West Bank save &quot;military positions, settlements
and Jerusalem,&quot; which would be left for the final-status talks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The former Labour Government carried out the first phase
by pulling out from most of the Gaza Strip (which was a painful thorn in
Israel's side) and seven towns in the West Bank, leaving more than 90% of
the territory in Israel's hands.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the present right-wing coalition headed by the
extremist premier Benyamin Netanyahu has adamantly refused to carry out
the second and third phase of the redeployment, arguing that it is not bound
by agreements to which it was no part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 22 December, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy accused
his colleagues in the Government of thinking they can procrastinate endlessly
about carrying out the second phase of redeployment in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, Levy complained that as a
result of government procrastination and equivocation, the United States
might exert pressure on Israel causing the latter to lose ability to manoeuvre.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu and most of his ministers have sought to seek
pretexts to evade the implementation of the second phase of redeployment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Normally, Netanyahu would cite the &quot;security issue&quot;
as the main hurdle impeding progress in the redeployment issue. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, when the PA leadership last month consented to
a US-brokered &quot;security cooperation agreement&quot; with Israel, the
Israeli premier started talking about the &quot;final-status settlement&quot;
and &quot;Israel's security interests.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is expected that Netanyahu will continue to try to evade
the real issues even after his upcoming meeting with US President Bill Clinton
slated for late January or early February.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources said Netanyahu would seek to meet with
as many US senators and congressmen as possible in the hope that they would
convince President Clinton not to exert pressure on Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clinton is also expected to meet with PA Chairman Yasser
Arafat in late January. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Both meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat were decided on
after US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to extract from Netanyahu
(during their meeting in Paris on 18 December) any commitment to carry out
a credible redeployment in implementation of the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

to Palestinians</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>London (Quds Press)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - The Palestinian
Commissioner-General in the UK called on Britain to apologize to the Palestinian
People for &quot;its historical responsibility&quot; for the Palestinian
ordeal caused by the British Balfour Declaration, which promised the Jews
a State in Palestine. Mr. Afif Safia also called for an apology from the
Israelis for the hardship the Palestinian People in Diaspora have been suffering
because of being homeless and because of the Israeli occupation. Mr. Safia
pointed out that the world is living in a period of &quot;apologies&quot;
for &quot;historic mistakes&quot; committed in the past. Germany apologized
to the Jews for the Holocaust massacres committed by the Nazis, Britain
apologized to the original people of Australia and Japan apologized to the
neighbouring countries harmed by the Japanese colonial policies in the past.
Therefore, Mr. Safia added, the Palestinians have the right to get similar
apologies for the oppression they suffered during this century.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Terrorist Rabbi Livenger gets easy sentence</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron (Quds Press)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - Palestinians
in Hebron were frustrated by the light sentence issued by an Israeli court
against Rabbi Moshe Livenger, a terrorist leader of Jewish settlers in Hebron.
Livenger was sentenced to six months imprisonment on charges of attacking
Muslims in Al Ibrahimi Mosque of Hebron and assaulting a number of Palestinian
public figures, as well as abusing a former high-ranking Israeli army officer.
The sentence was later changed, and he was ordered to work for community
service and to pay a bail of about $3,000. Palestinian sources believe that
the terrorist Livenger was brought before the court only because he publicly
insulted the former commander of the Central Area in the Israeli army, General
Elan Belan, during his visit to the old town of Hebron. Livenger described
Belan as a &quot;traitor&quot; and a &quot;killer&quot;. The sources added
that Livenger was sentenced to imprisonment in the past for similar charges,
but the sentence was suspended. Livenger was accused of murdering a Hebronite
merchant using his own machine-gun in the early days of the Palestinian
Intifadah.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (Quds Press)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>
- Israeli sources said Palestinians harmed by Israeli soldiers during the
years of the Intifadah have submitted about 5,000 petitions to Israeli courts
since 1990 asking for compensation from the Israeli Defense Ministry for
injuries sustained during clashes. A representative of the Ministry told
the Knesset's legislation committee that the Israeli Government has settled
some 4,000 of these petitions costing the Ministry about $35 million paid
as compensation for Palestinians injured by Israeli soldiers during the
Intifadah. He pointed out that the Ministry is still studying about 1,000
petitions, adding that compensation for these cases is estimated at about
$270 million. The Ministry's representative, who wanted the members of the
committee to approve a Government draft law to stop paying compensation
for Palestinian victims of Israeli suppression, alleged that the Israeli
authorities were forced last month to pay compensation totalling $7 million
to a Palestinian injured during the Intifadah even though he was one of
the &quot;most dangerous&quot; Palestinian activists wanted by Israel.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu: I want to see Palestinians at
each other's throats</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has expressed
renewed discontent with the &quot;memorandum of understanding,&quot; which
contained terms of &quot;security cooperation and coordination&quot; between
Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In statements published in leading Israeli dailies on 25
December, Netanyahu said the document was incomplete and needed to be revised.
&quot;We are talking only about a draft copy at the moment. The document
has yet to be approved. Our instructions to our representatives were that
they should go and listen to the other side and tell them of our demands
that they fulfill their commitments. The security document at the moment
is still only one of principles and is not a detailed plan,&quot; Netanyahu
said. The Israeli premier didn't spell out what he would like to see added
to the document.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Israeli sources indicated that Netanyahu would
like to put in the document clauses obliging the PA to, inter alia, hand
over Islamist detainees in PA-run jails to Israel, escalate the policy of
administrative detention (incarceration without trial for prolonged periods),
ravage the infrastructure of the Islamic movements, exercise tighter scrutiny
over the content of Friday sermons, exclude anti-Israeli references from
the Palestinian media, and close down all Palestinian institutions that
are run by individuals or groups deemed anti-Israeli.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu said the existing document had many shortcomings
and inadequacies, adding that drafts were defective, which necessitated
that they be resubmitted to the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's statements contradict assertions by key PA
officials that the document was signed under the supervision of CIA representatives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 24 December, Muhammed Dahlan, head of the Preventive
Security Service (PSS) in Gaza vowed that the PA &quot;will not agree to
change even a single word of the document.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said the document was acceptable to the PA because it
contained the element of reciprocity, a claim the Israelis have strongly
denied.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA has complained to the United States about the release
on 22 December of an Israeli army officer held in an Israeli lockup. Last
year, the officer killed an Arab child, Helmi al Shawashe, of the village
of Husan near Bethlehem, by smashing his head with his personal firearm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sa'eb Ereikat, the chief PA negotiator, protested during
a radio interview with the PA radio station, &quot;The Voice of Palestine,&quot;
that &quot;how could they dare demand that we round up Hamas activists when
they quietly release the murderers of our children from jail only a few
months or weeks after committing their crimes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ereikat's lamentation, however, is not likely to be translated
into a strong Palestinian stance in the face of Israeli blackmail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Observers note that the sole decision maker in the PA is
Yasser Arafat, a man often reputed of caving in to Israeli and American
demands, especially those pertaining to repressing the opponents of the
Israeli occupation, particularly the Islamists, within the autonomous enclaves.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Christian leaders: Christian-Muslim
relations are excellent, </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish persecution is behind Christian emigration</FONT></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem - From Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In response to recurrent Israeli misinformation about alleged
Muslim harassment of Christians in the West Bank, three prominent Palestinian
Christian leaders have described Muslim-Christian relations in the Holy
Land as &quot;excellent,&quot; arguing that the enduring and indiscriminate
Israeli oppression of all Palestinians was the main reason behind Christian
emigration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The three are: Professor Bernard Sabella of Bethlehem University,
Albert Aghazarian, Head of the Public Relations Department at Beir Zeit
University, and Afif Safieh, PLO ambassador to the UK.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a booklet published last month entitled &quot;Christian
Voices from the Holy Land,&quot; the three described Israeli insinuations
about Christian-Muslim relations in the West Bank, and in Palestine at large,
as &quot;malicious,&quot; pointing out that Christians and Muslims alike
were recipients of Israeli torment, oppression and persecution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sabella, a sociologist, pointed out in his article &quot;Palestinian
Christians: Challenges and Hopes,&quot; that owing to the Israeli military
occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Christian emigration from
Palestine increased drastically.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the Christians were especially susceptible
to the practices of Israeli occupation authorities as more than 12,000 of
them left East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to go abroad.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a paragraph entitled &quot;Excellent Christian-Muslim
Relations,&quot; Sabella contended that there was no need to reaffirm the
traditionally excellent relations between Christians and their Muslim neighbours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This tradition of good Christian-Muslim relations&quot;,
he wrote, &quot;has evolved through centuries of co-existence and exchange
in the cities of Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem, Ramallah and in the rural
areas such as Zababdeh, Bir Zeit and other towns and villages where Muslims
and Christians live side by side and interact in their pursuit of daily
preoccupations and concerns.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sabella cited several factors as contributing to the good
relations between Muslims and Christians including the Palestinians' common
experience of dispersal and loss of homeland, the recognition by Islam of
the many aspects of the Christian faith as crystallized in &quot;al Uhda
al Umariyya&quot;, which guaranteed the safety of Christians and their holy
places in 638.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sabella, answering the question of &quot;Why do Christians
Leave?&quot;, said Palestinian Christians were more sensitive than the rest
of the population to bad political and economic conditions, particularly
if they perceive that the prospects for advancement are not forthcoming.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that there was &quot;a clear relationship&quot;
between the higher rates of departure and the overall bad or worsening economic
and political situation in the Occupied Territories. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The result, he said, was more emigration, citing the dwindling
Christian population in East Jerusalem, which is today only 35% of what
it was in 1944 (around 11,000).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Albert Aghazarian, in his article &quot;Zionism, Jerusalem,
Multiculturalism and a New Palestinian Vision,&quot; sought to refute many
of the Jewish myths, which Israel succeeded in circulating around the world,
such as &quot;the 3000 anniversary of the foundation of Jerusalem.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He pointed out that if David showed up 3000 years ago,
the Canaanites (who were Palestinians, of course) were around 2000 years
longer than that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He pointed out that Israel is bringing torment to the Arabs
and no real security to Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for Jerusalem, Aghazarian pointed out that since 1967,
Israel has unilaterally declared the city &quot;reunified.&quot; He said
that by using terms such as uniting, dividing, reuniting and redividing,
implied by common sense, either bringing two or more parts together or setting
them apart. He said no such thing has happened in the case of Jerusalem.
In reality, he said, the town remained more religiously, ethnically, culturally
and politically divided than ever.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, Afif Safieh presents a moving personal account,
an epitome of the overall Palestinian plight, of the dispersal of his own
family to the four corners of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He described himself as &quot;a wandering Palestinian,
which I still am.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Having finished high school in 1966, I left for Belgium
to the University of Louvain, the oldest Catholic University in the world...the
1967 war made me the wandering Palestinian I still am. &gt;From Belgium,
I moved to Paris to pursue my studies then lived and worked in Geneva, Beirut,
Belgium again, Harvard, the Hague, London...&quot; he wrote.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Safieh related how he was repeatedly subjected to Zionist
harassment and intimidation whenever he sought to speak out against the
Zionist oppressors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;...At the entrance of the conference centre, around
50 right-wing supporters of Likud and a few Dutch fundamentalist Christians
were shouting anti-Palestinian slogans. To my surprise, one of the slogans
was 'Safieh-Satan'..I had thought that the usage of such concepts was restricted
to the third world. I sent a friend to tell them (half) jokingly: 'Please
do not compare me to Satan; you risk making hell look less unattractive
than it was intended to be'.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Safieh added, &quot;I don't know what they are shouting
down there but I hope it is 'Safieh go home'.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Safieh related another incident illustrating the extent
of Western ignorance of the Palestinian question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said &quot;in April 1996 I was invited by friends to
address 150 workers in the field of international development from the different
dioceses around the UK. Shimon Peres had just launched an unnecessary war
in Lebanon and the Qana massacre was only a few days old. I was revolted,
angry, and emotional and I believe, moving. During the coffee break an elderly
lady, obviously a pro-Israeli, angrily approached and shot at me: 'since
when are you a Christian?' I could read through her. She probably believed
that one day Yasser Arafat and his colleagues met in clandestine underground
and decided that I should convert to Christianity so that I would sensitize
audiences who might be more sympathetic if they were to learn that there
are also ...Christian Palestinians. She&shy;and I&shy;knew that Western
audiences could have that type of unchristian attitude. Very quietly, I
answered: 'Madam, I was born a Christian. My family goes back in Jerusalem
as far as the archives exist. Do not forget, Christ and the Christian faith
was born in Palestine. So I am a historic Christian. You can even say, a
pre-historic Christian'.&quot;</FONT></P>
