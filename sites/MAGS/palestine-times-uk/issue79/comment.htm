<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Authority (PA) is said to have given its
consent to a new &quot;security coordination pact&quot; with Israel under
the supervision of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to the Israeli Yediot Aharonot daily newspaper,
the security pact consists of 13 provisions made up by the CIA. It includes
the cooperation between the PA and Israel in fighting &quot;terrorism&quot;,
especially the trading of information about suspects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The pact virtually enables the Zionist State to determine
who among the Palestinians within the autonomous enclaves ought to be interned,
how long he or she must languish in jail, and if and when detainees would
be released.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Moreover, the new manifest disgrace would, <I>inter alia</I>,
oblige the PA to forward to the CIA a list of Palestinian detainees to be
released beforehand. The CIA's representative in Israel would then relay
the information to the Israeli intelligence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In addition, the PA would have to exercise &quot;tighter
control&quot; on the mosques, schools, universities, charitable institutions
and other bodies where the Islamists have influence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This could mean that &quot;critics (e.g. mosque speakers)
of the Israeli occupation and terrorism will be silenced.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It could even mean, given past PA disgraceful caving in
to Israeli-American dictates, that Imams and Muslim scholars citing and
interpreting Quranic verses critical of the oppression and evil perpetrated
by Zionists against Palestinians and other Arabs (e.g. South Lebanon) will
be asked to refrain from using the Muslim holy book in their Friday sermons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Embarrassed by the scandalous terms of the agreement,
PA officials have so far sought to extenuate the stunning gravity and shocking
perfidy of the document, saying that what it contained was nothing new.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, no Palestinian official has flatly denied Israeli
and foreign reports to that effect (the Palestinian press is heavily censored
and hence did not report on the subject).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The security cooperation between the self-rule Authority's
security services and the Israeli counterpart is not new. Many Palestinians
do not know that the Oslo Accords are themselves &quot;security&quot; in
nature. The year 1997 witnessed close cooperation between the two parties.
 The information given by the PA's Preventive Security Service to the Israeli
Shin Bet led to the arrest of the &quot;Surif&quot; cell, said to be responsible
for a number of military attacks against Israeli targets in Occupied Palestine.
 On 13 November 1997, the PSS also handed over two members of the Surif
cell to Israeli security officers. The two members of the military wing
of Hamas have been held by the PA security for several months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The newest development in the recent security pact is
the direct intervention by the CIA, which plays the role of &quot;coordinator&quot;
between the PA and Israeli security bodies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The PA rationale behind signing the treacherous agreement
is ostensibly to induce Israel to carry out the second phase of redeployment
in the West Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, Israeli and American officials have stressed
that there is no linkage between the &quot;security subject&quot; and the
&quot;political talks over redeployment.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In light of the above, it is amply safe to conclude that
the agreement is &quot;a self-evident act of grand treason committed by
an authority which claims to represent the aspirations of the Palestinian
people for freedom and liberation from Zionist shackles and domination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	How else can one possibly describe placing the entire
Palestinian civil society hostage to Israel's security whims?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Now, as it is sufficiently clear, even the fig leaf has
been removed, exposing an entity even more deformed and ugly than it formerly
appeared&shy;a quisling body of &quot;collaborators&quot; striving to serve
the enemy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Netanyahu will not give Arafat anything in return. In
other words, Arafat and his moribund Authority will achieve nothing except
an image of treachery and perfidy engraved in the individual and collective
consciousness of the Palestinian people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Soon, perhaps very soon, there will come a time when the
traitors are torn from within, sterile and depressive, with nothing to live
for. In any case, they will get what they deserve. <BR>
