<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Second Anniversary of Martyr Ayyash's Assassination</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>January 5 marks the second anniversary of martyr Yahya
Ayyash's death. It was on this day that a cellular phone he was using, exploded
in his face while he was talking on it.  The phone had recently been given
him by his friend's uncle when his previous cellular had stopped working.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yahya was known as &quot;The Engineer&quot; and was adulated
by hundreds of thousands of people who admired not only his ingenuity but
his courage to fight in the resistance for his homeland.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Engineer was born in Rafat of the West Bank in 1966.
 Yahya studied chemical engineering at Bier Zeit University in the West
Bank in the mid-80s.  Those who were close to Yahya knew him to be a devout
scholar of the Koran.  In 1992 he was married and when he died, he had two
sons, one newly born just before Yahya's death.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Until his assassination, Yahya was known to be a leader
of the military wing of Hamas and was well known for his proficiency as
a bomb maker.  The Engineer did not come to the notice of Israeli authorities
until the end of the Intifada, the Palestinian uprising at the end of 1987.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Over the following months, Yahya was involved in a number
of bomb attacks. The first successful attack occurred in April 1994, when
a suicide bomber blew himself up next to a bus in Afula, and Israeli town
just north of the West Bank.  Five suicide attacks then followed and Ayyash
was also linked to a double suicide bombing near Natanya in early 1995 which
killed 22 Israelis, mostly soldiers.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the last weeks of 1995, Hamas had promised the PA
leader Yasser Arafat, not to launch any more military operations from the
autonomous areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  And even though The Engineer
had kept this promise, he was still on the most wanted list of the Israeli
intelligence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even his enemies acknowledged that Yahya was not only courageous
but very intelligent and proficient as well.  He became a symbol to the
Palestinians and lived a life of constant danger and excitement as well.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He was a larger than life hero and made a difference to
his people. Though his enemies may have regarded him as a terrorist, his
people will long remember him as a freedom fighter and a man who was brave
enough to resist the cruel and ruthless occupation of his beloved country.
 There have been freedom fighters from the beginning of man's first injustice
and oppression against his fellow man.  And there have been heroes like
Yahya who have inspired their fellow countrymen to carry on the battle long
after their deaths.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sir William Wallace, the Scottish hero against English
oppression did more for Scots in death than he was able to do in life. 
His cruel execution by order of the English king, Longshanks, only served
to inspire and finally</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>unite Scottish nobles and peasants to overthrow British
rule under the newly crowned Robert the Bruce.  Yet no one called Sir William
a terrorist for he has gone down in history as a man who died for his ideals
and fought to free his country from occupation.  Yahya was no different.
 He died serving his country and died for the taste of freedom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hundreds of thousands turned out for Yahya's funeral. 
He was given a martyr's burial and will suffer the pain and agony of this
world no longer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are thousands of Yahyas and the powder keg of tyranny
will only produce a more determined resistance.  The Palestinians are for
the most part poor and starving.  They have lost their land, their homes,
their whole way of life.  They have little else to lose and freedom is that
cherished treasure that so many are willing to die for.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yahya lives on in the minds and hearts of his people. 
There are heroes in the seaweed and there are children in the morning. They
are  leaning out for love, they will lean this way forever.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>History is made by those who hang heroes.  Yahya was a
warrior-poet.  He fought for the freedom of his country and one day those
poor and starving Palestinians will regain their land, their dignity and
their freedom!</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Sheikh Yasin: Oslo Accords mysterious; Israel
explains them according to its interests</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Resistance should continue as long as there
is occupation</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Gaza- (Quds Press)- Interview by Abdel Ghani Shami</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the spiritual leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) said that the Oslo Accords were born dead and
that the Palestinian People should adopt Jihad as the method of resistance
to the occupation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Yasin described the negotiations with the Israelis
as a &quot;waste&quot; of time. Israel deceives the world by these negotiations
in order to make them believe that it wants peace, he said. The Islamic
leader assailed the Palestinian Authority for the mass punishment it practices
against its own people who had committed no crime and who have been arrested
for their political affiliations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following is the full text of the interview made with Sheikh
Yasin in his modest house in Gaza:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What is your comment on the current developments
in the Palestinian arena?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> What is going on in the
Palestinian arena is the inevitable result of the Oslo Accords. These Accords
were mysterious and gave the Israelis an opportunity to explain their provisions
in a way that serves the interests of the Israelis and in accordance with
their power. Therefore, the settlements continued and the Israeli government
turned its back to the world and did not honour the agreements it signed
publicly. In addition, Israel continued the closures, which made the Palestinian
People prisoners in a mass prison.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because the Palestinian Authority vowed in the Oslo Accords
to fight &quot;terrorism&quot;, which means fighting anyone resisting the
Israeli Occupation, the PLO turned from a basic enemy to Israel to an advocate
in Israel's favour, although the Israeli government has not fulfilled the
provisions of the Oslo Accords. Therefore, the PLO lost all their cards
in confronting the Israelis who are known for not keeping their promises
and pledges.  The fact is that the PA punishes the Palestinian People and
Hamas collectively, a thing which we strongly reject. Those who are arrested
did not commit any crime. They are held only for their political affiliations.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. If the Israeli-PLO negotiations failed, what would
be your alternative?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Oslo Accords were born
dead. Therefore, we still believe that the resistance of the occupation
through the use of Jihad is the method that the Palestinian People should
adopt. The present negotiations are a &quot;waste&quot; of time and deceive
the whole world as they project Israel as a country that seeks peace even
though it is piling up nuclear and chemical weapons to launch new wars against
the Arab and Islamic Nation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Do you support the freezing of the armed operations
against Israel?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>I said that the resistance
should continue as long as there is an occupation. But the Mujahideen can
choose the appropriate time for their operations. This means that the freezing
of the military activities against the Israeli Occupation should not be
mentioned under the circumstances of our people in the Occupied Territories
and in the Diaspora.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How can the national unity be reinforced? And how
do you assess your participation in the National Dialogue?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>We are one people with one
language and the majority of us embrace one religion. We all stand in one
trench against one enemy that does not differentiate between a Palestinian
and another. All Palestinians are targeted by the Israeli enemy. We also
have one goal, which is to liberate the Palestinian territories and to repatriate
the Palestinian People in Diaspora to their homeland. We should make these
facts the basis for the unification of our ranks against the Israeli conspiracies
that aim to sow the seeds of dispute among us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for our participation in the National Dialogue, it is
continuous. But we hope that this dialogue is not ceremonial but real in
order to protect the freedom of the Palestinian people and their right to
their homeland.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What is the position of Hamas concerning the current
circumstances? </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hamas has a firm stand.
It insists on continuing its Jihad against the occupation. It is willing
to sacrifice until the occupation is removed and the Palestinian State is
established on the whole Palestinian soil with Jerusalem as its capital.
Hamas rejects the accords &quot;Oslo&quot; produced, which the international
observers believe to be dead.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel, the United Nations, and Resolution
194</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Dr. Daud A. Abdullah*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is a woeful tale of injustice, betrayal, and failure.
Though unfinished, we are recalling it at this time because 11 December
represents an important turning point in its chronology. For it was on this
day 49 years ago that the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted
Resolution No.194 (III) recognizing the Palestinians' 'right to return'
to their homeland. Since that fateful day, 11 December 1948,  the Assembly
has reaffirmed this right on more than 100 occasions, only to be spurned
and disregarded by Israel. Being the only state in the world which came
into existence by the summons of the UN, and having been accepted into the
world body on the condition that it implemented Resolution 194, one would
have expected Israel to honor its treaty obligations and respect international
law. Instead, it has by its defiance, undermined the credibility of the
international body and destroyed its image among the community of nations.
</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Expulsion through terror</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In reality, Resolution 194 was neither a gift nor a favor
from the United Nations to the Palestinians. It was essentially the ratification
of a natural right which imposed an indisputable duty upon the party that
caused the problem. While Israeli leaders have denied whenever necessary
their responsibility for the dispersal of the Palestinians, they did on
certain occasions actually admit this responsibility. Staff Officer Yigal
Yadin recalled that he prepared the nucleus of Plan Dalet in 1944. The key
 targets of the Plan according to Yadin were 'the main Arab villages.' Former
Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett boasted that 'The most spectacular event
in the contemporary history of Palestine - more spectacular in a sense than
the creation of the Jewish state - is the wholesale evacuation of its Arab
population.' Elsewhere he recalled that the 1948 war had given the Zionists
the best opportunity to solve 'the most vexing problem of the Jewish state'
by expelling the Palestinians. The disclosures of David Ben Gurion, Israel's
first prime minister was no less significant. As early as 1937 he wrote
to his son informing him that  when the Jewish state was created, 'We will
expel the Arabs and take their places.' Ten years later he instructed that
'In each attack, a decisive blow should be struck, resulting in the destruction
of homes and the expulsion of the population.' </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Is there any need for further evidence to dispel the pseudo-academic
arguments that the Palestinian exodus was caused by an 'irrational panic
syndrome' and 'loss of community infra-structure'?  Would it not be an insult
to history and the United Nations itself to deny that the Palestinians only
left their towns and villages after they were invaded by Zionist terrorist
groups which subjected them to a reign of terror? The truth of the matter
as corroborated from the above quotations is that the majority of Palestinians
were forced to abandon their lands, property and homes as a result of armed
aggression. They were not, however, spontaneous or haphazard attacks but
instead the brutal enactment of an ideology aimed at creating maximum living
space for the Jews. Hence the destruction and depopulation of over 400 villages
between 1947 and 1949.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The right of return and self-determination</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The existence of the majority of Palestinian people in
exile since 1948 is a direct result of their inability to exercise their
'right to return.' At the same time, the Israelis' refusal to comply with
UN Resolution 194 throughout the period has apparently stemmed not from
a conviction that it is wrong or illegal, but rather because they fear the
consequences of its implementation. They know very well that the 'right
to return' in the case of the Palestinians bears with it certain civil as
well as political obligations. For whether it be enforced individually or
collectively the Resolution recognizes, in a civil sense, their right to
ownership and compensation for their property and suffering. Likewise, from
a political point of view, it upholds their national right to self-determination.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Notwithstanding Israel's obstinacy, the General Assembly
has since the early 1970s adopted a number of resolutions acknowledging
and underscoring the link between the Palestinian 'right to return' and
self-determination. Resolution No. 3089 of 7 December 1973 declares that:
'full respect for and realization of the inalienable rights of the people
of Palestine, particularly its right to self-determination, are indispensable
for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, and
that the enjoyment by the Palestine Arab refugees of their right to return
to their homes and property, recognized by the General Assembly in resolution
194 (III) of 11 December 1948, which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the
General Assembly since that date, is indispensable for the achievement of
a just settlement of the refugee problem and for the exercise by the people
of Palestine of its right to self-determination.' These same principles
were subsequently upheld in the preamble of resolution No.31/20 which was
adopted on 24 November 1976.  A few years later, 10 December 1981, the Assembly
went even further and approved resolution No. 36/120 reaffirming its 'rejection
of those provisions of the [Camp David] Accords which ignore or deny the
inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right of return,
the right of self-determination and the right to national independence and
sovereignty in Palestine...' Since 1981 only two members of the UN, Israel
and the US, have voiced their opposition to this resolution whenever it
came up for renewal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Admittedly, Israel's determination to prolong the Palestinian
refugee problem was not confined to its non-compliance with Resolution 194.
Other treaty obligations were similarly breached. Hence, even after signing
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 19 December
1966, the Israelis stubbornly refused to ratify the document until 3 October
1991. One may naturally ask, why on earth did it take the Jewish state 25
years to ratify the Covenant? The answer is quite simple. It wanted to evade
article 12 of the document which stipulated that : 'Everyone shall be free
to leave any country, including his own...No one shall be arbitrarily deprived
the right to enter his own country.' In this same context some observers
pointed out that Israel apparently delayed its ratification in order to
avoid responsibility for the estimated 300,000 Palestinians and their descendants
who were expelled in 1967. In this fierce world of international relations
motives seldom count for anything. For it is here, perhaps more than in
any other sphere, 'actions speak louder than words.' Thus, Israel's refusal
to fulfill its duties toward the refugees after ratifying the Covenant in
1991 establishes beyond any doubt a flagrant breach of its international
obligations.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Three claims</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet another question arises. Why has this situation persisted
even after the solemn proclamations at Madrid? In a real sense certain sections
of the international community appear equally culpable in  preserving the
status quo. They have contributed to this by overlooking the fact that the
same ideological considerations which led to the expulsion of the Palestinians
in 1948 and 1967 are the same doctrines which today deny them the right
of return. And by so doing, they made it not only easy but even necessary
to reward the likes of Shimon Peres with the Noble Award for peace. This
was clearly his reward for denying Israeli responsibility for the refugee
problem which he claimed 'can not be resolved.'  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Throughout the past 50 years Israel's policy toward the
refugees was founded upon three premises. Firstly, that they were not responsible
for the problem. Secondly, that there was a 'population exchange' in which
Jews from the Arab lands were settled in Israel, and thirdly that the Arabs
would not live in peace with their Jewish neighbors if they returned. Having
already dispelled the first argument we may briefly consider the other two.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To begin with, the majority of Jews who migrated from Arab
lands did not participate in the 1948 war. Similarly, they were not expelled
from these lands as was the case of the Palestinians from their ancestral
land. And, furthermore, there was actually no 'exchange' because the Palestinian
Arabs did not go to countries like Iraq and Yemen from where most of the
Jews came. The vast majority of them remained in the West Bank, Gaza or
Jordan. Shimon Peres' attempt therefore to compare Israel's 'generous' acceptance
of Jewish 'refugees' from the Arab world can not be matched with the refusal
of the Arab states to naturalize the Palestinians; a policy he criticizes
as being unnatural for people of the same race. In effect, the two situations
can not be equated because the rights of the Palestinian people is one matter
and the obligations of Arab states to Israel is fundamentally another. 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The third aspect of Israeli policy has been based on the
condition stipulated in Resolution 194; that the returning refugees should
live in peace with their neighbors. Their interpretation of this has not
changed since the days of Ben Gurion. He told the UN Conciliation Commission
for Palestine in 1949 that; 'The government of Israel believes that there
is a strong and definite link between the resolution of this problem and
the resolution of the suspended issues between Israel and the Arab states;
and that it is not possible to accomplish this except after peace has been
restored to the Middle East.'  While this rationalization may appeal to
those who blindly support Israel, it certainly would not stand the test
of impartial reasoning. For the instability and turmoil that has gripped
the region since 1948 was not caused by the refugees themselves, but was
rather the result of the denial of their national rights.  </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several factors have combined to make the Palestinian refugee
problem really unique. There exists today a wide gap between their geographic
dispersal on the one hand, and their legal unity on the other. Their expulsion
and continued exodus to every corner of the globe has resulted neither in
the loss of their national identity nor assimilation in their places of
refuge. Of course, it is practically impossible for them to exercise their
national right of self-determination without first realizing their right
to return. The UN General Assembly has, therefore, recognized this principle
on numerous occasions and has, indeed, enacted it with respect to the refugees
from the war in the former Yugoslavia. After fifty years of exile, torment,
and deprivation the Palestinians' right to return would seem all the more
obligatory since it has been proven that Israel was founded on the falsification
of history and the claim that 'Palestine was a land without a people.' Besides,
it should not  be forgotten by the powers that be that the Palestinian 'right
to return' was not only legally tied to the birth of Israel, but even its
admission into the United Nations.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surely the physical existence of the Palestinian people
is a fact that can neither be disproved nor ignored. The denial of their
right to exercise sovereignty over their land by Israel will not, in any
way, change this reality. True, there may be differences of estimates concerning
the numbers of Palestinians in their places of refuge. Yet, there is absolutely
no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the Palestinians live outside
of their ancestral land in exile. Israel's claim that the Palestinian exodus
took place too long ago and it would be impracticable to allow their return
is a non-starter. The fact is, the wrong done to the Palestinians is so
grave that the passage of time does not rectify it. And since they, the
victims, have neither abandoned, forgotten nor surrendered their right to
return, it is the legal duty of Israel and the member states of the UN to
respect and guarantee this right. No amount of pious excuses and protestations
shall absolve them from the collective guilt of betrayal and injustice to
the Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally with specific reference to the UN, its adoption
of Resolution 194 in 1948 seemed in every respect a recognition of its accomplicity
in the offense. Besides, its display of unlimited tolerance with Israeli
transgressions has not gone unnoticed; especially when it hastens to punish
and reprimand other regional culprits. The need for Arab unity and cooperation
can not, therefore, be over-emphasized. When all has been said and done,
are we still to assume that the future return of the Palestinians depends
entirely upon their acquisition of powerful friends in the Security Council?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Is Netanyahu's Downfall Imminent?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After only 16 months in office, Israeli Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu has probably scored the highest number of crises and
scandals than any other Israeli premier in such a short period of time.
The list is long and impressive. There was the tunnel crisis, the Bar-On
affair, the Azzam-Azzam affair, the Misha'al affair, the debacles in Southern
Lebanon (which resulted in the killing of over 100 Israeli soldiers this
year) and, now, the brewing crisis besetting his leadership and endangering
the delicate internal unity of the Likud and, not unlikely, the survival
of the ruling coalition itself, a heterogeneous federation of right-wing
and religious parties headed by Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The latest crisis within the Likud, as nearly always, is
basically rooted in the largely personal rivalry and bad chemistry between
Netanyahu (often described as a mean-spirited and conspiratorial-minded
character who would seek to outsmart his opponents rather than co-opt them
to his side) and prominent Likud figures such as Benyamin Begin, Dan Merridor,
Yisrael Katz and, to a lesser extent, Limor Livnat. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Added to this is the chronic &quot;confidence crisis&quot;
with Foreign Minister David Levy, leader of the Gesher party whose constituency
is largely made up of Jews from North Africa and other &quot;oriental Jews&quot;
known as the &quot;Mizrahim.&quot; In fact, it has become all too well known
recently that Netanyahu's relationship with Levy is more of &quot;a fragile
<I>modus </I>vivendi&quot; rather than of &quot;a coordinated teamwork operation.&quot;
Last month, Levy reportedly blamed Netanyahu for causing him to have a minor
cardiac attack after he had become utterly fed up with ignoring and side-stepping
matters that fall squarely under the responsibility of the Foreign Ministry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier this month, the internal tensions in the Likud
resurfaced. More than 2,700 delegate members, who met at the Likud headquarters
in Tel Aiv on 10 November, shouted down and humiliated the Likud leadership,
particularly Prime Minister Netanyahu and his closest adviser, Avigodor
Lieberman. The acrimonious convention, fraught with mutual recrimination
and invective accusations, centred on the issue of the &quot;Likud primaries&quot;,
which Netanyahu and supporters wanted to be scrapped, or at least indefinitely
postponed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jeered, whistled and booed at by the rowdy delegates, Netanyahu
couldn't even complete his speech before his own party's convention. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The delegates, worried that the Prime Minister was plotting
to concentrate power in his and his aides' hands, lambasted him for &quot;trying
to be despotic within the party.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yisrael Katz, the rebels' candidate for Chairman of the
Likud Central Committee, received a stormy applause from the audience when
he told Netanyahu that &quot;all we want is for you to hear us out. These
delegates are the Likud. They put you where you are today. Don't prevent
them from making decisions as they see fit.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With the party at a loss, and trying to limit the damage,
Netanyahu declared that the meeting was &quot;over&quot; and that a resumption
of the discussion over the primaries would take place at a later date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the evasive ruse, which seemed somewhat expedient,
later proved ineffective. The rebels continued their campaign against Netanyahu
and even succeeded in gaining new important converts such as Tel Aviv Mayor
Roni Millo and Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert, who both reportedly threatened
to form their own break-away party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As the implosion in the Likud continued with heightened
ferocity, Avigodor Lieberman, Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office
and one of the most controversial pivotal figures in the Netanyahu administration
(also the source of indignation for the rebels' camp) suddenly announced
his resignation on 23 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu expressed &quot;great sorrow&quot; at Lieberman's
resignation, while the opposition viewed it as &quot;another nail in the
Netanyahu-government coffin.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The next day, 24 November, Lieberman, in a much-publicized
news conference in West Jerusalem, lashed out at Netanyahu's opponents within
the Likud, accusing them of &quot;having caused the failure of the party
in the 1992 election and of trying to bring down the Government now.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;What happened here while the Prime Minister was out
of the country was too reminiscent of countries in South America and South
Africa. Anyone who considers himself a worthy alternative to the Prime Minister
can challenge him openly in the primaries, but not knife him in the back,&quot;
he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lieberman called Netanyahu's opponents &quot;ring-leaders&quot;
who were trying to topple the Government and terminate Likud rule in Israel
&quot;in connivance with the Shabak and Jebril Rajoub.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Lieberman's vociferous offense soon turned into a defense.
Only a few hours after he delivered his speech, the police recommended that
he be indicted for theft, fraud and embezzlement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, Lieberman, who had once been
accused of being a KGB agent, reportedly didn't pay NIS 80,000 of a NIS
110,000 he had borrowed from an organization called &quot;Gesher Aliya,&quot;
active in attracting Jewish immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet
Union.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was not clear if the charges were genuine, or if they
were, as Lieberman claimed, concocted by his political enemies for the purpose
of &quot;destroying him and further undermining the Prime Minister.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Undoubtedly, the resignation and possible indictment of
Lieberman will hurt and harm Netanyahu, at least for the time being. But
the fall-out should not be overestimated. In fact, Netanyahu may now feel
relieved, having, almost at no price, got rid of a close friend and ally,
who had become a Likud liability accused by the rebels and many other Likudniks
of being the source of discord and potential disintegration within the party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Is the storm over now?  Not by any means.  The rebels will
likely continue to &quot;narrow Netanyahu's horizons&quot; until he completely
succumbs to their demands. However, they are not going to exert &quot;too
much pressure&quot; on the Prime Minister, e.g. the kind of pressure that
would force him to contemplate forming a national unity Government with
the Labor party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This prospect (pushing Netanyahu towards Labor) is anathema
not only for the Likud refuseniks but also for the leaders of Gush Emunim,
represented in the Knesset and the Government by the National Religious
Party, the Mifdal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Those leaders, who are themselves part of the so-called
&quot;Land of Israel Front&quot;, have been making threats that they would
bring about the downfall of the Netanyahu Government if he went ahead with
his proposal for carrying out Israeli army redeployment from 6%-8% of the
West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, as many pundits here argue, the threats are not
all sincere, and this is what the chairman of the Likud Bloc in the Knesset
alluded to on the weekend.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said, &quot;If they succeeded in bringing down the Government,
they know all too well that the next Government would offer more concessions
to the Palestinians.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Doesn't this make &quot;blackmail&quot; the real title
of the crisis?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>U.S. Mideast policy- from failure to failure
</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Munir Shafeeq*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There's an Arab and international near-consensus holding
the U.S. Government as the first culprit for the breakdown that has beset
the 'peace process' recently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Total bias by the Clinton administration in favour of Israeli
policies under both the Labor and the Likud governments have left it semi-isolated
on the official Arab level. Other great powers, especially France and Russia,
seized the opening to play ever-growing roles in the very region that U.S.
foreign policy always wanted to set apart solely by and for itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But recent developments have shockingly demonstrated that
even when the U.S. throws all of its weight behind it, a Mideast settlement
purely on Israeli terms is NOT a feasible proposition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, recent developments have shown that the American
role in the region has begun to shrink, and that U.S. prestige has begun
to break down.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Three fine examples of recent American foreign policy blunders
in the region illustrate the point:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>First, there's the dismal lack of success of the State
Department in harnessing meaningful official Arab participation in Ad-Doha's
regional economic conference.  Instead, all it got from the larger Arab
states such as Saudi Arabia, and especially from Egypt and Morocco, was
a big NO. Yet that only made Albright stand shaking behind the podium in
Ad-Doha without finding anything to say except blazing Iraq!  And that was
an act bereft of courtesy vis-&brvbar;-vis the Qatari hosts as well as the
few other Arab delegations participating in the convention.  Then, very
shortly after her speech, Albright deserted the convention which she had
before braced herself to lead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The second foreign policy failure was the collective official
Arab refusal last month to partake in the U.S. administration's plan to
deal Iraq a devastating military blow.. Subsequently, U.S. diplomacy retreated
before and grudgingly accepted a Russian initiative to resolve the festering
crisis with Iraq.  That was a retreat that can't be diluted by the fact
that the [Russian] initiative incorporated the American condition of a full
return of U.N. inspectors to work, because the U.S. really wanted to resolve
the crisis differently, i.e., by force with official Arab blessing.  Neither
does it make the U.S. happy to see Russian diplomacy snatch the initiative,
or for Russia and France to set the Iraqi issue on a different track from
that which was previously imposed by the governments of the U.S. and the
U.K.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the third foreign policy blunder is perhaps the cruelest.
 It stems from the extraordinary success of the Islamic Summit in Tehran,
Iran, regarding both the resolutions adopted and the reconciliations, or
dual agreements, that took place behind the scenes there. That failure was
further highlighted by the stark contrast between the relative positions
of the U.S. administration and the Iranian leadership in the week during
which the summit took place: The U.S. administration seemed deprived of
its closest allies in the Islamic world while 54 Islamic states crowded
all around Iran in an atmosphere of friendship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Thus the success of the Islamic Summit in Tehran simply
put the U.S. administration in an unenviable position as it lost the initiative
while the momentum began to turn against it. Additionally, that may carry
the probable consequence of encouraging other hitherto pliant States to
defend their interests and to seek a more just world order, instead of submitting
meekly to an unjust Zionist world order that is run by a U.S. administration
that thrives on arrogance and wallows in double-standards.  That should
be good news, even to Iraq as well as Libya, Syria and Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Undoubtedly the U.S. administration is busy right now trying
to extract lessons from and to contain the consequences of the three aforementioned
failures. Several statements made by Clinton a couple of weeks ago hinted
that these recent U.S. foreign policy failures may be attributable to the
stalemate in the 'peace process'. Some analysts henceforth interpreted Clinton's
statements as indicative of dissatisfaction with Netanyahu's policies, thus
rendering them their due share of blame for the official Arabian scattering
away from the American line on the Middle East, and for the growing Iranian,
Russian and French roles in a traditionally American dominion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, if we assumed that the logical conclusion
of Clinton's statements will manifest itself in a serious and credible attempt
to distance American from Israeli positions, we have to first figure out
how Clinton may pull off such a policy shift while remaining a powerless
prisoner in the grip of the Zionist lobby in his National Security Council,
his administration, Congress, and the Media!!  We also can't forget the
Attorney-General and the big file full of scandals he's got on the Clintons.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet, and in spite of all that, if Clinton doesn't make
a significant foreign policy change, his administration will continue to
leap swiftly from one Mideast failure to another. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Mideast:  Misleading Promises</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>		About seven years after the start of the peace process
in Madrid, it seems that the only thing gained by the people involved was
false promises.  Promises of prosperity, independence and a flourishing
economy turned out to be mere propaganda.  No one received anything tangible.
 On the contrary, this propaganda caused severe damage to the economy and
even to the environment since all it really did was lead the people to believe
that the coming years would witness an unprecedented demand for land, busy
tourism seasons, the establishment of many investment projects and the opening
of larger markets.  But on the ground, none of these took place, at least
not in the sense that the people were prepared to handle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Initially, land prices in the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank went sky high.  As fast as they went up, they came down, and not even
to a level where investors could recover their debts by selling their precious
land leaving many with dashed hopes of a dream not realized.  Heavy construction
works took place, and in many cases turned out to barely cover the expenses.
 In Bethlehem, shop and hotel owners were deeply frustrated last Christmas
since all the tourists were arranged by Israeli tourist companies and most
were staying in Tel Aviv hotels; this is just the opposite of what they
were expecting and what they had prepared for.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In Jordan, it was the same story all over again.  Many
factories that had been established based upon the promises of new markets
soon closed down after being unable to export their products to Palestinian
and Israeli markets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In response to the predictions of increased tourism, many
hotels were built in Amman, Aqaba and Petra.  The small number of tourists
resulted in some of these establishments facing the difficult task of even
covering their expenses.  In another instance, one alarming consequence
of the false promises was caused by a Jordanian while attempting to prepare
a piece of his land to attract tourists.  In the 1997 summer issue of &quot;Environews&quot;,
a UNDP environment news update, an article entitled &quot;An eye on the
environment&quot; pointed out that &quot;with the expected boom in the tourism
sector, Jordan has started promoting investment on the eastern shore of
the Dead Sea.  This development scheme, which could bring economic benefits
for Jordan, can also bring threats to the special environment of that area,
the first of which is the diversion of the course of the Zara waterfall.
 This thermal waterfall originates from a 60C spring, as well as some 50
other thermal springs.  An investor in that area has diverted the course
of that waterfall, cut all the native trees and planted exotic flowers to
construct a recreational spa without conducting any environmental assessment
studies on the consequences of the project.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	As the promises continue, so will the damage to all aspects
of life, since one can never tell how the investor or the layman will react
in response to misleading promises, especially when no constraints are made
to control reactions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	One does not want to be pessimistic or hold the peace
process responsible for everything wrong going on, but at the same time,
what is going on in the political arena and what it is casting over the
public life and mood makes one wonder; would there ever be a positive angle
with which to perceive the whole peace process?<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>U.S. smear campaign paints image of Muslims
</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>as persecutors of Christians</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ghada Khouri*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Capitalizing on the negative stereotype of Arabs and Muslims
in America, several conservative Christian and Jewish organizations managed
to push for the introduction of a bill in the U.S. Congress to protect persecuted
Christians worldwide.  Under the guise of upholding human rights and religious
freedoms, the legislation selectively targets Arab and Muslim countries
and bases itself on dubious and politically-motivated sources. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The bill, called the Freedom From Religious Persecution
Act, is sponsored by Pennsylvania's Senator Arlen Specter and Virginia's
Representative Frank Wolf, both Republicans. By focusing on Arab, Muslim,
and Communist states such as China, the bill offers a means to stamp out
those countries considered 'unfriendly' by the U.S. establishment.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The proposed legislation would create a new office in the
White House, bypassing the Department of State's Human Rights Bureau, to
monitor countries suspected of persecuting Christians. It would shut off
foreign aid and ban exports to the offending countries; deny those countries
U.S. support for loans by multilateral banks; and prevent the issuance of
visas to individuals who carry out acts of persecution. The bill would also
give priority to asylum-seekers suffering religious oppression, which could
result in the filling up of asylum quotas thereby shutting out applicants
fleeing from ethnic or political persecution.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Not only does this bill place the persecution of Christians
above all other types of human rights abuses, but it also turns a blind
eye to Israeli human rights abuses directed against one of the oldest Christian
communities in the world, namely Palestinian Christians. Criticism of Israel
would not be in tune with the bill's underlying message, which aims to paint
an image of Muslims as fanatics and abusers of other religious groups. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the bill's proponents, Oklahoma Representative J.C.
Watts, recently wrote in The Washington Times about what he described as
the &quot;precipitous rise in violent attacks against Christians&quot; in
Palestinian-controlled areas. He cited a report issued by the Israeli government
which confirms the &quot;steady outflow of Christians from their homes...
to Europe and North America&quot; as a result of &quot;official harassment&quot;,
including &quot;the use of torture, threats, and surveillance.&quot; Representative
Watts seemed oblivious to the reaction of the Palestinian Christian community
in response to the Israeli report. Christian leaders issued a statement
strongly criticizing the report as &quot;cheap and malicious publicity&quot;
seeking to &quot;disunite the Palestinian people.&quot; The Latin Patriarchate
of Jerusalem dismissed the allegations as &quot;totally untrue.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meantime, persecution directed at Palestinians&shy;both
Christian and Muslim&shy;by the Israeli authorities continues unchecked.
Israel routinely denies entry permits to Christians and Muslims who wish
to visit their holy sites in Jerusalem. It seals off entire communities
through closures, destroys homes, confiscates land, builds settlements,
tortures prisoners, and perpetuates a steady ethnic cleansing policy designed
to rid Jerusalem of its Palestinian inhabitants by revoking their residency
permits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The campaign, which led to the introduction of the Freedom
From Religious Persecution Act, seems timed to upset relations between U.S.
churches and Arabs seeking support on the issue of Jerusalem.  In the past
year, a coalition of American churches has voiced their support for a 'shared
Jerusalem,' based on the concept of two capitals for two states. This presents
a direct challenge to Israel's efforts at claiming exclusive sovereignty
over the Holy City despite UN resolutions proclaiming East Jerusalem as
illegally-occupied territory.  Those U.S. churches supporting the concept
of a 'shared Jerusalem' now find themselves in a delicate position as their
support for Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem risks becoming increasingly
unpopular when Arabs and Muslims are being painted as persecutors of Christians.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A closer look at the way in which the Freedom From Religious
Persecution Act made its way into the U.S. Congress helps bring to light
the bill's political motives. The campaign was launched by Michael Horowitz,
a conservative Jewish activist, who began planting the issue of the persecution
of Christians in the media. New York Times columnist A.M. Rosenthal, who
is the author of regular columns denigrating Arabs and Muslims, said Horowitz
&quot;screamed me awake&quot; on the issue. James Dobson, President of the
Christian group Focus on the Family, wrote in an April newsletter: &quot;Michael,
who is Jewish, was among the first to recognize what was happening to Christians
and began a frantic campaign to notify the world.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>First exposed by the media, the issue soon snowballed into
a national debate. Horowitz teamed up with Nina Shea, Director of the Puebla
Program of Freedom House and author of The Lion's Den, a book about the
persecution of Christians in Muslim lands. Together, they organized a conference
about the &quot;Global Persecution of Christians&quot; in Washington, D.C.
Shea writes in the March 1997 issue of Crisis magazine: &quot;Persecution
in the Middle East has wrought a vastly diminished Christian presence,&quot;
citing countries like Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and
Turkey.  &quot;Mounting evidence indicates a worldwide trend of anti-Christian
persecution based on two political ideologies:  communism and militant,
politicized Islam.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This view was echoed by Bat Ye'or, an author who has joined
the ranks of the Horowitz-Shea gang.  Ye'or testified before the U.S. Senate
where she declared that &quot;the most egregious human rights atrocities
are being committed against Christians living in militant Islamic societies.&quot;
 The hearing gave impetus to the legislation drafted by Specter and Wolf.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ye'or, whose real name is Gisele Littman, currently resides
in Geneva, Switzerland.  She came to the United States on a tour last May
to promote her latest book, The Decline of Easter Christianity Under Islam:
From Jihad to Dhimmitude.  In it, she portrays Muslims as conquerors bent
on subjugating, converting, or killing Christians under their rule. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a New York Times review dated 15 June 1997, Arthur Hertzberg,
a Professor of religion at Dartmouth College and a senior research fellow
at Columbia University's Middle East Institute, said Ye'or &quot;collected
documents through the ages to 'prove' that Islam has always hated and persecuted
Jewish and Christian minorities.&quot;  He added that Ye'or provides a &quot;justification
for Israeli maximalism&quot; and that her hard-line views, which are &quot;couched
as scholarship, are both untrue and a preamble to disaster.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although human rights abuses abound in the Middle East,
what is most disturbing about the current campaign is that Arab Christians
were not given the opportunity to speak for themselves.  Indeed, no Arab
Christian scholars were invited to participate in the congressional hearings.
Anticipating such criticism, Ye'or explained to the Religious News Service
that Christians in the Arab world &quot;have feared to appeal to the West
because hundreds of years of living under Islamic rule has resulted in them
adopting the mentality of dhimmitude, or servitude.&quot;  Ye'or would have
the American public believe that even if Arab Christians were able to speak
out, they would not have much to say since they have essentially been turned
into a speechless, oppressed minority. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact that Arab Christians have been an integral part
of the Arab world in which they have played a historical role, including
their active participation in the Arab Renaissance, is carefully dissimulated
by the proponents of the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act.  In the
current context of Middle East politics, the image of Muslims as anti-Christian
and anti-Jewish helps shield Israel of any criticism as Benyamin Netanyahu's
government is falling out of favour with the U.S. Administration.  After
all, if Muslims innately hate Jews, why should Israel offer any concessions
for a peace which is inevitably doomed by their enm?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The proposed legislation and the ongoing media campaign
perpetuating an ugly image of Muslims and Arabs in the United States further
deepens mistrust and sows the seeds of discord as the peace process remains
in limbo.  To make matters worse, this is only one of several anti-Arab
legislations as Congress continues to interfere with the Clinton Administration's
timid attempts at reviving the peace process.  Last year, Congress overwhelmingly
passed a bill to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999
despite objections that it would essentially legitimize Israel's illegal
annexation of East Jerusalem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Clinton Administration's wobbly and short-sighted policy
toward the Middle East has done little to repair the image of the United
States as a blind supporter of Israel regardless of Netanyahu's provocative
policies.  The United States' hypocrisy and lack of a clear strategy was
manifest in several contradictory policy statements and actions.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the one hand, the United States criticized Israel for
building a settlement on Jabal Abu Ghneim, thereby completing the encirclement
of Jerusalem. Yet, the U.S. government vetoed a UN resolution condemning
the Israeli move.  On the one hand, the United States expressed regret at
the loss of life in the vicious April 1995 Israeli attack against Qana,
in which U.S.-made bombs caused the deaths of more than 100 civilians. 
Yet, the U.S. government vetoed a UN resolution requiring Israel to pay
for the damages inflicted on the UN compound. On the one hand, successive
U.S. Administrations have declared Israeli settlements as obstacles to peace.
 Yet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called them &quot;legal&quot;
during a recent television interview, while the U.S. government fails to
penalize Israel for using American tax dollars to violate international
law with impunity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The effect of these contradictions is to give Israel the
green light to pursue its belligerent policies.  Like a parent unable to
discipline a spoiled child, the United States' indecisive responses to Israeli
provocations amounts to a gentle slap on the hand&shy;after which the ungrateful
and stubborn offspring returns to his old mischievous ways.  So long as
the United States is not perceived as an honest and neutral broker of peace
in the region, hopes for an end to the current climate of hostility are
slim.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The propaganda campaign under way only serves to widen
the gap between the United States and the Arab parties at a time when a
rapprochement is badly needed before Netanyahu succeeds in burying the peace
process once and for all and reneging on all of Israel's obligations. So
long as politically-motivated propaganda and negative stereotypes are allowed
to direct U.S. policy, the road to peace is but an endless and futile effort.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Naji Alloush*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some Arabs with democratic inclinations have grown accustomed
to voicing their protest upon the arrest of a writer or politician by an
Arab regime. And of course, they're right on track here, except for the
fact that they tend to complain only when tensions arise between them and
a given Arab government, but not when they have an 'alliance' with the arresting
government!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet what's with some of these democratic Arabs, or non-democratic
Arabs, standing speechless, neither clamorously nor calmly protesting, nor
declaring where they stand, even before the massacres of Algeria?!  Isn't
what's happening in Algeria worth a stance?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surely, democratic and non-democratic Arabs alike have
more than one concern preoccupying them because:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>I.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>	They find killings, arrests
and the wholesale confiscation of rights rampant in this vast Arab homeland.
There have been civil wars, assassinations, counter-assassinations and massive
abuses of power. Talk of democracy has turned into a sort of cruel, practical
joke, not only because it now pertains to uplifting the face of local tyranny,
but also because it has become connected to justifying international intervention,
to be sponsored, of course, by the U.S. government. Thus 'democracy' has
turned into a thin veneer for occupying land, displacing people, appropriating
oil or natural gas, or for the manipulations of foreign powers and the despotic
plundering local Arab groups working with or for them.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>2.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>	They find aspirants to political
power talking a &igrave;good game&icirc; about democracy, and ranting against
tyranny while out of power, but once they get hold of the helm, they unleash
torrents of despotism till there isn't any possible room for more.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>	They find the Arab regimes
violating every sanctity and taboo, so they wonder why they should condemn
perpetrators of crimes from among weaklings whom are not rulers.  If they
condemned them, wouldn't they be supporting the oppressive rulers against
the ruled?!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, Arab democrats and non-democrats alike are
not really decision-makers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Their fathers and mothers have taught them not to 'meddle'
in public affairs. A slang proverb in Palestine warns: &quot;Hide your head
when the state differs&quot; for no one shall give you mercy!  Hence in
the struggle that is not governed by any rules or conventions except lust
for power and control, there's no protection for any, and people have to
hide their heads.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That is the case of Algeria, too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The killers show up suddenly to reap the people with sickles,
axes, machetes and bullets.  They don't discriminate between combatant and
non-combatant, man and woman, or baby-boy and baby-girl.  They don't even
declare why they kill or what they want.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Do they want the Algerian people to support them against
the government? Or do they seek to show the people that the Algerian government
is incapable of protecting them?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whatever the causes or excuses, palatable or not, these
killings are veritable crimes before which no Arab should remain silent.
 They should be incriminated.  All measures should be taken to stop them,
and their root causes should be tackled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If fellow Arabs and Muslims don't do that, they should
be held accountable for what's happening and will happen to Algeria!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They'll be responsible for the exacerbation of the slaughter,
the disintegration of authority, and the further spread of the carnage amongst
more Algerian groups: Arabs and Berbers, peasants and urbanites, the agents
of France and the agents of the U.S, or between inhabitants of one region
and another.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They'll also be responsible if an international intervention
occurs under the pretext of stopping the carnage.  Such an intervention
will only protect the belligerent parties, and bring new antagonists into
the arena.  It might even carry the conflict into Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania
and the Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, as the Algerian government exhibits incompetence,
and its armed forces seem less than capable of bringing the continuous massacres
to a halt, the killers will continue their operations to make the government
feel ever more incompetent, and to make the Algerian people feel that the
government has become totally superfluous: Algerians should simply submit
to the rule of killers without hesitation or delay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, Arabs should do all they can to bring the massacre
to an end, and to stop the slaying, all the slaying, and to stave off a
foreign intervention. For eventually tolerating or demanding foreign intervention,
perhaps alongside another U.N.-sponsored natural gas-for-protection deal,
will only mean that the massacre has accomplished its objectives. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The power of the Intifadah still felt</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the summer of 1968, daily television broadcasts of
the war in Vietnam helped turn American public opinion around from overwhelming
support of the war to massive opposition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Almost 20 years later, almost by accident, the Palestinians
learned the same lesson, that bringing the reality of Israel's brutal occupation
to American TV sets might make a difference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On Tuesday, 8 December 1987, a group of Palestinians confronted
Israeli soldiers on the streets of the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians wore
civilian clothes and carried stones. The Israelis were heavily armed and
wore protective military uniforms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the confrontation that morning, 16-year-old Hatem Abu
Sisseh was killed. He wasn't even born when the Israelis, exploiting the
empty bombastic threats of Arab leaders, started the 1967 war by invading
Egypt, Jordan and Syria and occupying the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Arab
East Jerusalem, the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It was a humiliation that caused Palestinians to realize
that they could not rely on the Arab World for liberation from Israeli occupation.
They launched a &quot;Revolution&quot; intended to draw worldwide attention
to their cause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But years of hijackings and bombings targeting civilians
only caused public opinion to harden, especially in the United States, which
provided most of the funding for the Israeli occupation and its aggression.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The intifadah, however, was different.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Everyday, Americans turned on their television sets to
witness heavily armed Israelis firing live ammunition at women and children
civilians who only carried stones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Unlike in Israel, American forces are prohibited from
firing on civilians, even when the civilians throw stones. The one exception
was the murder of four students at Kent State University by the Ohio National
Guard, which was immediately condemned!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Using rocks found strewn in their streets, Palestinians
confronted the soldiers and pressed their demands for liberation and independence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Daily images of a Palestinian child courageously standing
in the line of fire of an Israeli soldier while throwing a stone were permanently
etched in the American conscience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Intifadah did in weeks what the &quot;Revolution&quot;
had failed to do in 20 years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Americans quickly saw parallels between the Intifadah
and the Biblical confrontation between David, armed only with a slingshot
and a stone, and his oppressor, a heavily armed behemoth named Goliath.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Suddenly, to many Americans, and around the world, Israel
didn't look so good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Americans did not like the idea that their taxes were
paying for the armour and the weapons that Goliath used against the young
David.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But there was one important difference between the images
that brought about an end to the Vietnam War and the images of the Intifadah,
which raged on for more than seven years: The anti-war movement had qualified
leaders who helped FOCUS PUBLIC OPINION ON THE NEGATIVES OF the Vietnam
War. The Palestinians in the United States did not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In fact, it is the failure of Arab and Palestinian Americans
to organize themselves in support of the Intifadah that kept the Intifadah
from achieving more than it did.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Arab American community was disorganized, divided
and represented mainly by shortsighted textbook-carrying academics who had
little understanding of the American political process, public opinion or
professional methods of influencing the media.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	While the Intifadah succeeded in destroying Israel's once
&quot;heroic&quot; image in the United States and in other countries, the
failure of Arab Americans to support the Intifadah allowed Israel to counter
the damage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Let us commemorate the successes of the Intifadah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But let us not forget the shortfalls that prevented it
from winning ultimate Palestinian independence.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Satisfaction with OIC summit</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Authority, the Islamist camp and Palestinians
in general have expressed marked satisfaction at the prominence and &quot;grave
concern&quot; accorded to the Palestinian cause, particularly the issue
of Jerusalem, at the recent OIC summit in Tehran. PA Chairman Yasser Arafat
labeled the summit &quot;a victory for our cause&quot; while Hamas expressed
the hope that &quot;this time it won't be just rhetoric.&quot; The Palestinian
press also lauded the &quot;different flavour&quot; of the conference as
&quot;promising&quot; and &quot;not as futile as many may have thought,
given the outcome of past Arab and Islamic summits.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The gist of Palestinian optimism seems to stem from the
fact that the Islamist Iranian regime is to assume the presidency of the
OIC for three years to come, an opportunity which many observers believe
the Iranians would seek to use to the fullest extent possible, if only to
underline the &quot;qualitative gap&quot; between the &quot;competence&quot;
of Islamist Islamic regimes and the &quot;ill-reputed impotence&quot; of
secular Islamic regimes in catering to Muslim causes and interests and especially
in &quot;putting up a strong stance against Israeli insolence.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, this particular orientation was echoed by several
Iranian officials who pointed out that &quot;our style of the chairmanship
of the OIC is going to be different.&quot; This statement is very significant
because the next three years will supposedly witness the arduous negotiations
on the so-called final-status issues between Israel and the PA, including,
first and foremost, the sensitive subject of Jerusalem. And if, as it is
all too well expected, the Israel-PA talks on these issues is headed into
the kind of impossible deadlock that everybody foresees (e.g. because of
Israel's adamant insistence on retaining East Jerusalem), then the chairman-state
of the OIC (Islamist Iran) would find itself obliged to mobilize the Muslim
world for the sake of Jerusalem, at least, lest its chairmanship of the
OIC prove &quot;just as futile as the others.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, Arafat himself sought in earnest at the OIC summit
to galvanize Muslim awareness by sounding the alarm bell over &quot;the
looming perils facing Jerusalem and the Aqsa Mosque.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat said, &quot;I am ringing the bell of danger to warn
against the Jewish plan to build the Temple of Solomon in the place of al
Masjidul Aqsa (Aqsa Mosque) after removing it.&quot; Furthermore, Arafat
warned Muslim leaders against the &quot;creeping Judaization of Jerusalem
and the ongoing obliteration of the town's Arab, Islamic identity.&quot;
The PA chairman also argued that without &quot;occupied Jerusalem returning
to its legitimate owners as capital of an independent Palestinian state,
there can be no durable peace in the region.&quot; Arafat's speech at the
conference, which somewhat fairly described the situation on the ground
in Jerusalem and the occupied territories, angered Israeli officials, who
described it as &quot;particularly offensive.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier at the conference, Iranian President Muhammad Khatami
spoke strongly about &quot;Muslim rights in Palestine and the paramount
issue of al Quds al Sharif (sacred Jerusalem)&quot;.  He said genuine peace
in the region could be established only through the realization of all the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including &quot;the inalienable
right of self-determination, the return of refugees, and the liberation
of the occupied territories, in particular al Quds al Sharif.&quot; Khatami,
using words which even Arafat didn't dare use, added that &quot;the hegemonic,
racist, aggressive and violent nature of the Zionist regime amply manifested
in the systematic and gross violation of international law, the pursuit
of state terrorism and the development of weapons of mass-destruction, seriously
threatens peace and security in the region.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khatami's words, though probably vitriolic in form, may
have carried an implicit message reading something like &quot;Israel must
change her behaviour but not be annihilated.&quot; The underlining of the
Jewish state's &quot;hegemony, racism and aggression,&quot; rather than
&quot;the illegitimacy of Israel,&quot; may suggest that the present Iranian
regime may be willing eventually to tacitly support a peace process with
which the Palestinians would be pleased, e.g. one that would involve the
complete Israeli pull-out of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the establishment
of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, since a &quot;watershed development&quot; as such
seems utterly unlikely even in the intermediate future, the songs coming
out of Tehran <I>vis-</I>&agrave;<I>-vis</I> the peace process should not
be understood as the Islamic Republic about to join the Oslo caravan. As
for the Palestinians, the hope now is to turn Iranian opposition to the
peace process into a Palestinian asset, not a liability as thought before,
that could be utilized in enhancing the &quot;regional balance of power&quot;
in favour of the Palestinians, and eventually in pressuring Israel, though
indirectly, into dealing more seriously with the issue of Palestinian rights.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The solution to the Palestinian problem:
Asian role</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Riza Sihbudi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A United Nations Asian seminar and NGO symposium on the
Question of Palestine on the theme &quot;Achieving a just, comprehensive
and lasting solution of the question of Palestine&ntilde;the role of Asia&quot;
was held in Jakarta, summer 1997. The seminar and symposium were convened
by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian
People in accordance with its mandate under General Assembly resolutions
51/23 and 51/24 of 4 December 1996 and are part of the continuing efforts
of the committee to promote a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to
the question of Palestine and to mobilize international support and assistance
to the Palestinian people during the transitional period.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The meeting was attended by more than 100 high-level representatives
of the host government and of the UN, as well as representatives of diplomatic
missions accredited in Jakarta, media representatives, NGOs, and universities
and other institutions interested in the subject. Presentations on the various
topics were made by well-known political figures, academics and other personalities
from Asia and other regions. Among of the Indonesian panelists were Professor
Fuad Hassan (former Minister of Education and Ambassador in Egypt) and Dr.
M. Amien Rais (Chairman of the Islamic-based Muhammadiyah organization).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	All participants at the seminar and symposium expressed
serious concern over the stalemate in the Middle East peace process and
the current Palestinian-Israeli dispute. The most recent tensions emerged
with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu's policy to build a Jewish
settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa), located near the holy city of
Al-Quds (Jerusalem). The Netanyahu policy has drawn strong opposition from
several quarters. The majority of participants also strongly condemned Netanyahu's
policy. At the time of this meeting, Dr. Suleiman Annajab (member of the
Executive Committee of the PLO) said that Israeli bulldozers are violating
Palestinian territory, making Al-Quds Jewish and doing away with Christian
and Islamic traditions. He called on the international community to increase
its role at this time when the Zionist regime was dictating its view to
the Palestinian people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At his opening remarks, Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali
Alatas, said Israel must now salvage its own credibility by complying with
the provisions of various agreements reached with the Palestinians..not
selectively, sporadically and conditionally, but with consistency and fairness.
He called on the parties to resume a productive dialogue on the remaining
key issues and get back on the road to peace. To Indonesia, he said, Israel's
occupation of Arab territories is a fundamental issue. No diplomatic relations
between Indonesia and the Zionist regime can be envisaged as long as the
Palestinian problem and the Middle East conflict are not peacefully and
justly resolved.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Mr. Alatas recalled the Special Declaration on the Middle
East Peace Process, issued by the Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) in New Delhi on 7-8 April 1997, calling on NAM countries, as a first
step, to freeze relations with Israel at their current level (the same step
took by the Ministers of the Arab League in Cairo on 1 April 1997). According
to Mr. Alatas, the Palestinians had not only been deprived of a just and
dignified peace but also of the fruits of peace. For too long, they have
lived in abject economic conditions as Israel systematically curtailed all
opportunities for a decent livelihood. By repeatedly closing the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank under various pretexts, he added, Israel has caused Palestinian
unemployment rates to soar, depressed living standards, dislocated whatever
limited commercial activity is still possible and in general brought the
economy of the newly autonomous areas to the brink of collapse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Meanwhile, Mr. Alvaro de Soto, UN Assistant Secretary-General
for Political Affairs, in a statement on behalf of UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, said that since last year, there had been a number of setbacks
in the peace process in the Middle East. Meetings such as this, he said,
could bring the issues to the attention of larger constituencies and would
hopefully have a positive effect in helping the UN to carry out its work
in the area. In an extraordinary situation like the current one in the Middle
East, said Dr. K.M. Khan (representative of the International Coordinating
Committee for NGOs on the Question of Palestine, ICCP), the International
Community cannot be a mere spectator. The NGOs, having played a vital role
during the past 12 years in support of the Palestinian cause, would have
to continue their &quot;zealous efforts&quot; in mobilizing the opinion
of the International Community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Therefore, all participants at the seminar and symposium
reaffirmed their support for the struggle of the Palestinian people to achieve
their inalienable rights, including the establishment of their State, with
Al-Quds as its capital. They also expressed support for the Middle East
peace process and stressed the need for the full implementation of the agreements
reached between the two parties, namely the Declaration of Principles in
September 1993 and the Interim Agreement of 1995. However, they expressed
serious concern over the fact that the International Community had not been
able to put an end to actions by Israel that were contrary to the letter
and spirit of the Agreement reached and obstacles to the progress of the
peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Both Asian and Middle Eastern countries have mutual interests.
Japan (as a major economic power in Asia), for example, imported about 80%
of its oil from the Middle East. On the other hand, Japan is also one of
the major financial donors to Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, with assistance
targeted at raising living standards and upgrading infrastructure for economic
and social development. Japan's assistance to the Palestinians was especially
substantial, amounting to more than US$ 270 million, which was focused on
financing social welfare and job creation. In response to emergency situations,
said Mr. Takao Natsume (from the Japan Foreign Ministry), Japan had given
US$ 27.5 million in addition to the ordinary bilateral assistance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	However, in promoting a comprehensive, just and lasting
solution to the question of Palestine through solidarity and assistance,
Asian states are facing some problems. First, some Asian nations are still
facing problems within their countries &quot;similar&quot; to the Palestinian-Israeli
dispute (Kashmir in India; East Timor in Indonesia). Secondly, the majority
of Asian states are closing allies with the US government; it has become
impossible for them to take a different stand from the US policy otherwise.
Actually, everyone knows that the US government has never changed its pro-Israeli
policy in the Middle East affairs. For example, the veto by the US in the
UN Security Council last March had given a tremendous boost to the destructive
forces in Israel, and the US government now has taken a position different
from the rest of the International Community. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The true meaning of Ramadan</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The month of Ramadan is upon us.  In all Islamic countries,
as well as throughout the world, Muslims are fasting during this blessed
month. Ramadan is a very special time.  Allah first revealed the Qur'an
during Ramadan.  Good deeds during this month receive extra rewards from
Allah.  The devils are chained and the gates of Hell are closed.  This month
has so many blessings, yet so many of us could be missing out on them. 
What should be done during the month of Ramadan? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Many today are following tradition and customs without
knowing the real religious activities that should accompany Ramadan.  Sure,
we all know to fast, but before we begin fasting, we must realize that we
should have the correct nia (intention).  Fasting is an act of worship that
is rewarded only by Allah, and He alone knows if we have kept it or not,
for Allah sees everything.  Fasting cannot be done to please others or used
as a way to lose weight.  One must say that 'I intend this fast to please
Allah.'  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Fasting helps us to learn self-control and actually awakens
our conscience so that we are closer to our Creator.  We feel the pangs
of hunger, and we can understand, in a small way, how the poor and destitute,
who barely find enough to eat throughout the year, must feel.  Thus, this
should make us more aware of others and encourage us to give charity, not
only throughout the month of Ramadan as well as our obligatory charity (zakat)
at the end of Ramadan, but also throughout the whole year.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is unfortunate to see that many Muslims only pray,
fast, read Qur'an and give charity during Ramadan while neglecting these
wonderful acts of worship throughout the rest of the year.  If one really
loves and fears Allah, as well as desiring a home in Paradise, then he should
constantly worship Allah. We must be thankful servants and show our appreciation
for all of Allah's gifts and blessings by remembering and worshipping him
every day throughout the year.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ramadan in many Islamic countries has been brought to
the level of tradition and culture.  I'm not saying to throw away all traditions,
for within Arab traditions there still exist Islamic principles.  However,
the community of Muslims must re-educate themselves about their religion
and throw out un-Islamic practices that may hinder their worship.  What
is important in this holy month is to worship Allah to the best of our abilities.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some people switch their schedules, where they fast in
the day (and sleep), then at night they gorge themselves with food until
the dawn.  Things should be kept in balance.  We are allowed to eat after
sunset, but we must remember that the Prophet said to &quot;fill our stomachs
with one-third food, one-third drink and one-third air.&quot;  This month
means that we should feel different from the rest of the year, otherwise
what kind of fasting is this?  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Also, it is good to visit each other and to break our
fast together, for the one who feeds a fasting person gets the same reward
as the one who fasted (hadith).  However, we should keep our visiting hours
in check.  We should not neglect religious duties, such as prayer.  It is
recommended by the Prophet to pray extra prayers after breaking our fast.
 It is good if we include our visitors in these religious activities or
go to the mosque to pray in congregation and to gain extra rewards.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Other things to do in Ramadan include breaking our fast
on time and taking sahoor (the morning meal) before Fajr (sunrise) time.
 We should try to be as the Prophet was during Ramadan.  He was given to
us by Allah as a role model to follow.  We should pray extra, read Qur'an,
help people and give charity.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We should also be careful not to break our fast unless
we are ill or traveling, and in these cases we must make up missed days
before the next Ramadan.  However, one can even break his fast by uttering
lies and saying bad words and curses.  We should not gossip.   We should
not fight, unless it is unavoidable.  If one approaches you and tries to
argue, try to avoid an argument by saying 'I'm fasting.'  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If we keep to Islamic conduct and worship, then we can
make the most of Ramadan and gain a lot of rewards.  Insha'Allah, if we
refine our behaviour and increase our worship in Ramadan, may Allah help
us to maintain this worship throughout the year.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Let us enjoy this Ramadan, help others and ourselves and
bring back the true meaning and spirit of Ramadan. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Hunter And The Bone</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by:E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was obvious that the old timer hunted, but just what,
was never quite clear, not even to himself.  He had sought a variety of
entities in his life.  When young, he looked for adventure and wisdom; as
he grew older, he explored the legend of the fountain of perpetual youth
and the city of gold. He excavated archaeological sites and even searched
for the mysteries of life entombed in the ancient pharaoh's pyramids in
Egypt.  He had come across a few bits and pieces of gold but never anything
enough to make him rich.  And though he had been a part of exciting discoveries
of antique civilizations, his meager reward never surpassed his accumulation
of knowledge and experience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And so here he was, brought by fate at the end of his years
to a rocky canyon devoid of any evident human habitation, a place where
crags, crevices and holes had been carved and shaped by the winds of time.
It was</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>early evening and the old hunter stretched out on the ground
propping his back against a large rock while he watched his campfire roast
a wild rabbit he had earlier caught.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The meat smelled good over the open fire and he was hungry.
 He rose, went over to his camping gear, took out an enamel teapot, filled
it with water from a nearby brook and placed it on the outer embers of the
dying fire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Nothing like some tea with a good meal,&quot; the
old man said to the canyon walls.  &quot;Just seems to hit the spot.&quot;
 He yawned and stretched his arms into the endless space to ease the cramp
in his muscles.  &quot;It's been a long</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>way so after supper I guess I'll try to get some sleep.
 Tomorrow's another day and I'll worry about it when it comes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After his simple meal, the hunter slowly drank his tea
which he savored as though it were the finest beverage he had ever tasted
and then following a long silence, doused out the fire with some water and
went to unroll his sleeping bag.  He spread it on a clearing and with his
jacket for a pillow, lay down to sleep.  In a distance he could hear a coyote
yelp, some pigeons coo and an owl hoot.  He smelled the ashes of his campfire
blend with the dryness of the arid air mix with a scent of pine.  The night
seemed unusually black when he stared up at the foreboding sky.  Only a
few stars peered down at him from their guard of the celestial realm.  All
at once, the silence of the canyon surrounded him and almost crushed him.
 He began to hum an old miner's tune in mock bravery and in his temporary
solace said at last, &quot;I have to get some sleep or else I'll have no
strength left for a long tomorrow.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He dozed off into a fitful slumber interrupted at frequent
intervals by bouts of wakening.  When he did fall asleep, he dreamed of
ghosts and monsters and of falling into a deep eternal pit filled with a
blazing inferno.  And was that the satanic laughter of shrieking fiendish
spirits who stoked the furnace of Hell?  Off and on he awoke crying out,
&quot;No, don't take me! Leave me alone!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Beads of sweat ran off his forehead and soaked his jacket-pillow.
 He tossed and turned until finally he smelled the break of dawn. He opened
his eyes.  The air was cool and sweet.  Small birds chirped for food and
dew</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>clung like dainty ornaments on the desert poppies and thistles.
 The nightmare of the eve before seemed remote now and not so vivid.  It
was all just a figment of his imagination.  &quot;It's a hard thing for
one to be alone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Solitude gets on a man's nerves.  It is indeed unfortunate
that I have no children to bear my name and none will cry for me when I
die.  What have I accomplished during my lifetime?  I've searched high and
low for so many things but never really found myself.  Who am I?  Where
have I been and where am I going?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was no answer but the sound and smell of nature,
his sole companion. He got up and headed for the brook, bent down on his
knees and washed his face and hair in the cool crystal water still unpolluted
by man.  Feeling refreshed, he patted his face dry with a threadbare towel
and set about gathering some dry wood to make his breakfast fire.  As he
scrounged about, he saw something white gleam in the early sunlight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;What's this:&quot; he asked himself as he scooped
the earth with a piece of wood to uncover the object that had attracted
his interest.  &quot;Why, it's a bone of a human and there is a tuft of
yellow hair wrapped around it!&quot; he</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>exclaimed amazed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The lock of dry hair was jagged and wire-like from the
countless eons of ages it had been buried in the ground.  The old-timer
held the bone closer for inspection. &quot;How long have you been hidden
here beneath the earth, unknown to humanity?&quot; he questioned.  &quot;What
is your secret and did your owner pass away alone uncelebrated in life as
in death?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The piece of past humanity crumbled slightly in his hand
and the gnarled warped ancient golden wires scratched him forcing him to
yell to the thing, &quot;Tell me the horrors of your secrets!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the bone, still crumbling, remained silent and the
only answer was that of the careless unconcerned canyon winds which blew
against him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Terrified, the old timer watched as the yellow tuft of
hair twisted itself around his own knotted hand.  He could not free himself
from the haunted bone and he roared out in despair and terror: &quot;Leave
me alone! Get away from me!  Let go!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the bone said nothing and continued to wrap itself
snake-like around the hunter's appendage and then suddenly he knew.  He
knew it all.  The bone he was handcuffed to was none other than his own.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Peace On Earth</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by:Erik Paul</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It's Christmas!!!  There is magic in the air. You can hear
 bells ringing and children singing Christmas carols. Last minute shoppers
rush home with  presents tucked under their arms hoping to please that special
someone. The visions of sugar plums dance in young ones' heads and every
child wants to tell Santa Claus dreams of special gifts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reindeer dart through winter skies bearing presents for
those children who have been good and you can hear that &quot;Ho ho ho!!!&quot;
burst through the stillness on a cold winter night.  Stockings are hung
by the chimney with care in hopes that Saint Nicolas soon will be there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Christmas scenes decorate frosty painted lawns and everywhere
there is joy and peace. Almost everywhere but in a little hut deep in a
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.  In fact, if you look closely, you will
note that there are few signs of the festive season here.  There are no
trees decorated with gold, green and red balls,  no tinsels swinging from
branches and certainly no shining star to guide weary minds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The best gift this year in fact for little Nidal would
be a decent meal and a fireplace to keep him warm.  Even better, Nidal needs
a father to bestow on him the kind of love that only a father can provide.
 Nidal can barely remember his father who disappeared in the middle of the
night during an Israeli raid on the boy's home a few years ago.  Since then,
the boy's mother has tried her best to eke out some kind of meager income
just to keep her child alive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To make matters worse, during the Christmas season, when
carols were being sung in the little town of Bethlehem, Nidal was coming
home from school when a rubber bullet shot by an Israeli gun caught the
small boy in the head. The child who had fallen in a pool of his own blood
was carried off to a nearby hospital by a man who witnessed his fall.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nidal was placed in ICU for a few days.  Yesterday he was
released to the care of his mother but he seemed to remember hearing just
before  he struggled to gain consciousness that he might not ever walk again.
Something had gone wrong to the part of his brain that sends messages to
his legs to make them move.  It seemed like a dream when he heard the doctor
use this strange word, &quot;partial paralysis.&quot;  And somehow he seemed
to hear the wails of his mother next to him as he tried his best to survive
on a life support system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally he was taken off life support and ICU and sent
home to bed.  It took a lot of strength to look out the window beside where
he was lying. There were no scenes of Christmas right outside his window.
 No carols were being sung and no shining star topped the tree that was
not standing in the middle of his living room floor.  There would be no
gifts for Nidal.  The greatest gift he could have right now anyway were
his father and the use of his legs.  Had Santa forgotten little boys like
Nidal?  He had really been a good boy, done all his homework and attended
school faithfully whenever it was not closed down by the Israeli authorities.
 He obeyed his mother and even tried to help her around the house.  He understood
that she was tired when she trudged home from work shortly before he arrived.
 He didn't lie or steal or even throw stones like the other boys at the
occupation forces.  What was it then that prevented little children like
Nidal from experiencing the peace and love that was foretold on snowy streets
elsewhere around the world?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Was he being punished because he dared to be born Palestinian?
 Did he really have any say as to where and to whom he was to be born to?
 Did he somehow commit a crime when years ago, the Zionists stole  his grandfather's
land and the land of his father?  The hole in his head that had penetrated
his brain and caused his &quot;partial paralysis&quot; seemed cruel punishment
for being Palestinian and certainly not what children on Santa's</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>knee in other parts of the world would wish for Christmas.
 Was his blood part of the flood that had drenched Palestinian land even
before 1948 when the Zionist state of Israel was proclaimed, the sacrifice
demanded instead of the peace and love that every child is entitled to?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The boy stared out his window.  He could hear distant voices
singing far away of the peace and joy he had never experienced and at night
when all was calm in the little town of Bethlehem, Nidal stared still out
his window at one single bright shining star that seemed to promise hope
for all mankind.  Yet when he woke in the morning, his greatest hope would
not be to find gifts beneath a tree that did not exist, but the use of his
legs and the music of his father's voice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Children like Nidal are forgotten on busy Christmas streets
elsewhere. While the eyes of millions of small children light up on Christmas
day as gifts are ripped open, Nidal will still be lying paralyzed on his
un-Christmasy bed.  He will wait and hope to regain the use of his legs
and pray that one day he will see his father walk through the door healthy
and laughing just as he used to do when Nidal was even younger.  The greatest
gift to so many unfortunate children is the gift of life and the right to
have the peace and joy that resounds in Christmas sermons in happier places.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When you sing Christmas carols this year and feel warm
and comfortable sitting before your Christmas feast, remember Nidal and
wonder if he will ever walk again or see his father.  The true meaning of
Christmas is to spread peace and joy to all parts of the world.  In some
homes, there will be no joy and little peace and  no warm fireplace nor
gifts under the tree.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Think twice this season as you have a MERRY CHRISTMAS and
a HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The politics of Islamophobia</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>By Yaqub Zaki</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>(2- 3)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dickens' outburst of Islamophobia was mild compared to
what was being expressed on the spot by British commanders.  Brigadier Nicholson
said: &quot;Let us propose a Bill for the flaying alive, impalement, or
burning of the murderers of the women and children at Delhi.  The idea of
simply hanging the perpetrators of such atrocities is maddening.  I wish
I were in that part of the world [he was at that moment in the Punjab] that
if necessary I might take the law into my own hands.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a matter of fact, a Bill was not necessary, and Nicholson
headed a siege-train from the Punjab to besiege Delhi. There followed a
massacre on such a scale as to stand in comparison with the sack of Baghdad
by the Mongols. What happened is best described in the words of British
eyewitnesses. Mrs. Saunders said: &quot;For several days after the assault
every native that could be found was killed by the soldiers&shy;women and
children were spared.&quot; The lucky ones were shot.  Here is another eyewitness;
Lieut. Majendie describes a Muslim being burned alive: &quot; the horrible
smell of his burning flesh as it crackled and blackened in the flames, rising
up and poisoning the air&shy;so in this 19th century, with its boasted civilization
and humanity, a human being should lie roasting and consuming to death while
Englishmen and Sikhs, gathered in little knots around, looked calmly on.
 No one will deny, I think, that this man at least, adequately expiated
by his frightful and cruel death, any crimes he may have been guilty of.&quot;
 All this, note, was in 1857, when the agitation for the abolition of the
slave trade was at its height, when the sanctimonious Wilberforce was spouting
in Parliament against the inequity of the trade and Mrs. Fry was worried
about conditions in British prisons. So when the Jews demand an apology
from Germany for the Holocaust, why don't we demand an apology from Britain
for this?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although Nicholson fell at the Kashmir Gate thereby entering
the annals of imperial hagiography, he needn't have worried; without benefit
of a Bill all his proposals were taken up and executed&shy;no pun intended&shy;to
the letter: hanging, burning alive and impalement. Many people languish
under a misapprehension, thinking that impalement consists in having a stake
thrust through your midriff from the back. Nothing of the kind!  The stake
is thrust up through the rectum in such a way as to bypass all the vital
organs until it emerges at the shoulder. It is then planted upright in the
ground. A letter home from a British officer asks:  &quot;How much longer
are we to be outraged by the sight of writhing humanity on stakes?&quot;
 Beheading was also resorted to. Apart from burning alive and merely being
hanged, there were other methods. The phrase in Lawrence's directive, to
be blown away from guns, calls for amplification. Here is what it is like
to be fired from a cannon, described by Mrs. Coopland in her own immortal
narrative, A Lady's Escape from Gwalior: &quot;Many prisoners were hanged
after the battle, and as it was discovered they did not care for hanging,
four were tried and sentenced to be blown away from guns; accordingly, one
day we were startled by hearing a gun go off, with an indescribably muffled
sound . An officer told us it was a most sickening sight.One gun was overcharged,
and the poor wretch was literally blown into atoms, the lookers-on being
covered with blood and fragments of flesh: the head of one poor wretch fell
upon a bystander and hurt him.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking of one mutinous regiment, the 55th, that other
figure of imperial martyrology, the hero of many a Victorian history book,
Sir John Lawrence, records his humanity in the following terms:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot; they were taken fighting against us, and so far
deserve little mercy. But, on full reflection, I would not put them all
to death.  I do not think we would be justified in the eyes of the Almighty
in doing so, and 120 men are a large number to be put to death. Our object
is to make an example to terrify others.  I think this object would be effectively
gained by putting to death one fourth to one third of them.  I would select
all those against whom anything bad can be shown&shy;such as general bad
character, turbulence, prominence in disaffection in the fight, disrespectful
demeanour to their officers during the few days before the 26th and the
like.  If these did not make up the required number, I would then add to
them the oldest soldiers [note the utilitarian sentiment, right on the heels
of the Evangelical sentiment].  All these would be shot or blown away from
guns, as may be most expedient. The rest I would divide into batches: some
to be imprisoned ten years, some seven, some five, some three.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To the unsystematic pillaging of drink-maddened soldiers
there succeeded the systematic pillage of the prize-agents. They dug up
the floors of the houses in search of buried treasure. Delhi, the glory
of Mughal civilization, was depopulated. Such of the inhabitants as survived
the sack were driven out into the countryside, whilst proposals were debated
for the city's future.  There was a demand that it should be razed to the
ground, like Carthage&shy;echo, or, rather pre-echo, of Peregine Worthsthorne.
To the proponents, it does not seem to have occurred or mattered that Delhi
contained some of the finest specimens of architecture in the world. Another
proposal was that only the mosques be demolished. Delhi fell in September.
Only in January, 1858, did people begin to trickle back; at first only Hindus
were allowed to return.  &quot;The purpose of this business,&quot; Lord
Roberts said, &quot;is to show those rascally Musulmans that, with God's
help, Englishmen will still be masters of India.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Roberts, who was at that time a subaltern, wrote home to
his sister: &quot;You must not think, darling Harriet, that I pity the sepoys
or blackguards who are rebelling against us. On the contrary, few are more
unrelenting than I am. When a prisoner is brought in, I am the first to
call out to have him hanged.&quot;  Another reports with zest:  &quot;I
spent that night on picket at the Masjid above-mentioned, much of our time
being passed in shooting or hanging prisoners taken during the day . Many
a poor wretch breathed his last at this spot, dying, for the most part,
with a calmness and courage worthy of a better cause.&quot;  On 23 September,
exactly a week after the fall of Delhi, Mrs. Coopland, already quoted, writes
with unction that the provost marshal had put to death &quot;between 400
and 500 wretches since the siege. The soldiers, inured to sights of horror,
and inveterate against the sepoys, were said to have bribed the executioner
to keep them a long time hanging, as they liked to see the criminals dance
a 'Pandies' hornpipe', as they termed the dying struggles of the wretches.&quot;
 Her host, one Captain Garstin, had just come from the hanging of the Nawab
of Jhujjur and remarked that &quot;he was a long time dying.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>General Neill's instructions were specific:  &quot;Certain
guilty villages were marked out for destruction, and all men inhabiting
them to be slaughtered. All sepoys of mutinous regiments not giving a good
account of themselves were to be hanged. The town of Futtehpore, which had
revolted, was to be attacked and the Pathan quarters destroyed with all
their inhabitants. All heads of insurgents, particularly at Futtehpore,
to be hanged. If the Deputy Collector is taken, hang him and have his head
cut off and stuck upon one of the principal (Mohammedan) buildings of the
town.&quot;  Women and children were burnt to death in the villages torched
by Neill's column as it advanced on Cawnpore.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After the people, it was the turn of the buildings, particularly
the mosques. Although Delhi was not in the end razed to the ground, an entire
quarter, that containing the residences of the Mughal nobility, was razed.
The Jami' Masjid had a narrow escape.  First, it was to be demolished, but
it was too valuable as a Sikh barracks and stabling for that. Next Egerton,
the City Magistrate, proposed that it be converted into a church, with each
floor slab inscribed with &quot;the name of one of our Christian martyrs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally it was sold to a Hindu, and from hiwas bought back
by the Muslim community five years later.  Other mosques were not so lucky.
 The Akbarabadi Mosque, where Shah Waliullah had taught, was demolished.
 The Fatehpuri Mosque was used as shops and offices for 20 years.  The Zinat
al-Masajid, built by Aurangzebe's daughter, might have remained a bakery
for good had it not caught the eye of Lord Curzon about 1900.  We should
be grateful to Lord Curzon:  after 50 years of so-called independence, three
Islamic monuments in Pakistan are still Christian churches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I don't need to recount the story of the capture of Bahadur
Shah's sons by Hodson at Humayun's tomb, or their murder.  What is less
well known to my audience, I am sure, is that the scene of the exploit&shy;they
were proud of it&shy;is depicted on a marble relief on the huge cenotaph
the Anglican authorities erected to Hodson's memory at Lichfield Cathedral.
 Bahadur Shah's sons were stripped naked first to humiliate them. Their
bodies were displayed on the stone terrace in front of the Kotwali for three
days; they were then thrown into the river.  &quot;In 24 hours,&quot; Hodson
gloats in a letter to his wife, &quot;I disposed of the principal members
of the house of Timur the Tartar.  I am not cruel, but I confess I did rejoice
at the opportunity of ridding the earth of these wretches.  I intended to
have them hung (sic.), but when it came to a question of 'they' or 'we',
I had no time for deliberation.&quot;  Twenty-one royal princes were hanged
a few days later.  1,400 residents were marched to the Yamuna, where they
were beheaded and their bodies cast into the river.  Some women jumped into
wells to escape dishonour; others were killed by their husbands before they
slew themselves.  Montgomery Martin, in a letter to the Bombay Telegraph,
attests that &quot;All the city people found within the walls when our troops
entered were bayoneted on the spot; and the number was considerable, as
you may suppose, when I tell you that in some houses 40 or 50 people were
hiding. These were not mutineers, but residents of the city, who trusted
to our well-known mild rule for pardon.  I am glad to say they were disappointed.&quot;
 Kaye wrote:  &quot;Eight dead carts daily went their rounds from sunrise
to sunset to take down the corpses, which hung at the crossroads and the
market-places.&quot;  He estimated that 6,000 people had been so disposed
of.  Wilfred Scawen Blunt, during a visit in 1883, was informed by the Chieftan
of Loharo that about 26,000 were killed by soldiers, or hanged or blown
away from guns during the eight months following the fall of the city. 
It is unlikely that these figures are exaggerated.  Greathed said, &quot;The
sacrifice of 500 villainous lives for the murder of two English is a retribution
that will be remembered.&quot; Hundreds of Qur'ans were burned; the Ulama'
were hanged.  The anti-Islamic frenzy in India was if anything exceeded
by the anti-Islamic frenzy of the British Press, which surpassed itself
in calling for merciless reprisals.  Government by gallows lasted right
into the following year.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What are we to make of all this?  First, that Islamophobia
is endemic in the European psyche, but periodically it becomes epidemic.
 It, I dare to hazard a guess, may be even more virulent this time round,
for now Europe is united, whereas in the 19th century it was divided.  This
much can be deduced from the way in which Britain dragged a reluctant Germany
in her wake over the Bosnian War when Britain held the chairmanship of the
EC. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>WHOSE LORD?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By John Hartung*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two annual rituals were performed last month in America.
 On December 12th the United States joined Israel to vote against Palestinian
self- determination in a United Nations resolution that passed 160-2. And
on December 25th, Americans celebrated Christmas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Understanding the connection between these events requires
us to put aside common propaganda about Jesus.  We must turn instead to
the First Century Jew described in the Christian Gospels. Consider Jesus'
attitude toward Canaanites -- the equivalent of today's Palestinians (Matthew
15:21-29):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>[M.K. -- offset quote by one space]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.  And
behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried &quot;Have
mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely possessed by
a demon.&quot; But he did not answer her a word.  And his disciples came
and begged him, saying, &quot;Send her away, for she is crying after us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 	He answered, &quot;I was sent only to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.&quot;  But she came and knelt before him, saying,
&quot;Lord, help me.&quot; And he answered, &quot;It is not fair to take
the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 	She said, &quot;Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the
crumbs that fall from their masters' table.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 	Then Jesus answered her, &quot;O woman, great is your
faith!  Be it done for you as you desire.&quot;  And her daughter was healed
instantly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>[M.K. -- offset quote by one space]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Yes, Jesus healed the woman's daughter in this story,
but only after taking advantage of a mother's desperation by forcing her
to agree that  Canaanites should be treated like dogs by their Jewish masters.
And why not?  Profoundly servile Canaanites could be very useful.  The 'children's'
(i.e., the children of god -- the Jews) latrines needed cleaning and Canaanite
servants could live on crumbs that fell from their masters' table.  Perfect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Jesus spent his life in pursuit of a single mission --
a mission that can only be understood by studying the Jewish Bible, or what
Christians call the &quot;Old&quot; Testament.  Jesus did not consider that
book to be an &quot;Old&quot; Testament.  For Jesus it was the Only Testament,
and he worshipped the god described in that book -- a god who repeatedly
commanded his followers to commit genocide against the people who inhabited
the land that the Israelites wanted to steal:  &quot;In the cities of these
peoples that the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save
alive nothing that breathes, but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites
and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the
Jebusites, as the LORD your God has commanded&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:16-17).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  	The second part of the original Zionist plan was to
subjugate people outside of Israel:  &quot;Thus you shall do to all the
cities which are very far from you . . . When you draw near to a city to
fight against it, offer terms of peace to it.  And if its answer to you
is peace and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall
do forced labor for you and shall serve you&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:15 . .
. 10-11).  The ultimate purpose of this &quot;peace&quot; plan was to extort
money, and this prototype of Israeli foreign policy reached its Zenith during
the reigns of King David and his son, Solomon:  &quot;Now the weight of
gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, besides that
which came from the traders and from the traffic of the merchants, and from
all the kings of Arabia and from the governors of the land&quot; (1st Kings
10:14-15).  Six hundred and sixty-six talents is about 60,000 pounds of
gold -- more than twice the amount that Atilla the Hun was able to extort
from Rome every year before he sacked it for late payment.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	After the excesses of David and Solomon the Kingdom of
Israel was so weakened by civil war that nations which had been sending
tribute began to send troops.  This is what ultimately led to Jesus' mission.
 Like many would-be Jewish Messiahs before him, and many since, Jesus wanted
to restore the Kingdom of David.  That is why his followers, and the Canaanite
women who agreed to be a dog, called him &quot;Son of David.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The point here is that Christianity is a form of Judaism.
 Christians worship the god of the Jews. Deep in the pit of their baby-Jesus-loving
souls, Christians believe in a god who gave Jews special rights in Canaan,
and so special rights in Palestine -- including, ultimately, a right to
lie, a right to steal, and a right to kill.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The issue here is a story that appeared in the December
14th </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jerusalem Post: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>		[M.K. -- offset quote by one space]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat referred to the opening of an exit to the Western
Wall Tunnel in 1996 and the subsequent &quot;anger of the Arab and Islamic
nations and the whole world.&quot;  He said this was in addition to &quot;plans
to settle&quot; Ras al Amud and Har Homa.  These projects, Arafat went on,
are &quot;aimed at isolating Jerusalem from its Palestinian hinterland and
building a replacement city for Bethlehem, which is preparing its 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Our Lord Jesus.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Arafat is a great man -- on the order of George Washington,
Mahatma Gandhi, Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Min, and Nelson Mandela.  But there
is a line in an old Eagles song about &quot;what a woman can do to your
soul.&quot; I worry about the words &quot;Our Lord&quot; in the above quote.
 You should be worried too.  It is good to receive the help of good Christians
and good Jews -- people whose sense of fairness overrides the scriptures
of their religion -- but Palestinians should not have a leader who shares
the underlying delusions of Judaism and Christianity about Chosen People
and god-given rights to land.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Injustice: cause and effect</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Most people in the world have a basic understanding of
the scientific terms &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;.  Logically,
if something occurs, there will be an effect.  For example, if a stranger
walks up to you in the street, and he slapped your face, then he caused
what will happen next.  There are a variety of possibilities for what could
follow.  You could walk away and forgive the man. Or, you could tell the
police and take him to court.  Or, you could hit him back.  Most humans
have a natural defense system that will act upon itself as a reflex to the
event, just as when a doctor taps one's knee and his leg kicks out.  So,
most of us would probably hit the man back for hitting us.  Thus, we would
have given the effect.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Cause and effect occur in everything in life whether it
is politics, society or everyday life.  The term &quot;Domino Theory&quot;
states that if one country is taken over by, for example, Communism, then
nearby countries would also be taken over one after another.  Here we can
take the same theory and call it the &quot;Domino Effect&quot;, where if
one thing occurs, which starts the ball rolling, then it causes something
else to occur.  This continues indefinitely.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the case of Palestine, we find cause and effect to
play an active role.  The effect can be altered if the right cause is employed.
 However, the natural reflex to defend one's home, family and person is
a basic human right.  When the Israelis took over Palestine and kicked people
out of their homes, raped women, killed children, stole homes and lands,
put many into prison without charging them, tortured prisoners and in general
the civilian population, as well as trying to destroy the culture and the
basic shape of the Palestinian society, then what could the expected effect
be?  Naturally, people will resist occupation and fight those who fight
them.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Another cause in the escalation of Palestinian &quot;violence&quot;
came from the United Nations and the United States.  The Palestinians see
no real justice in the international court.  They find the UN unable to
enforce UN resolutions against Israel for their human rights' crimes.  So,
the cause exists, thus the effect is taking the fight into their own hands
in order to defend their human rights.  Also, America has placed itself
in the middle by siding with Israel.  They claim to be mediators of peace,
but they are definitely on Israel's side.  They have spent years sending
weapons and billions of dollars in foreign aid to Israel.  They came at
various times in the past to help the Israelis to fight in their wars against
the Arabs.  Then, the US declares Jerusalem to be the sole capital of Israel
while it is still considered, by the UN, as an international city.  The
Palestinians cannot accept their mediation as being fair and just.  Thus,
America is causing an effect that will only be known in the near future.
 Naturally, resistance is still continuing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Another major cause in the midst of the facade of peace
is Netanyahu, the most stubborn and militant Prime Minister in Israel's
short history.  He has broken most of the agreements of the Oslo accords
as well as acted against UN resolutions.  He has stepped up the building
of Jewish settlements in the middle of Arab-majority areas.  He has angered
not only Palestinians, but also his own people.  He has angered the leaders
of other Arab countries, especially King Hussein, when he sent his Mossad
agents into Jordan to assassinate Hamas political leader, Khaled Misha'al.
 Of course, they botched the job and were unsuccessful. If they had been
successful, imagine the troubles and the crisis they would have set off
in Jordan as well as in Palestine.  Every move Netanyahu makes seems to
be a major blunder.  He is the cause that has brought about so many negative
effects.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	People in the world have complained about &quot;extremist&quot;
groups, but to call something extreme depends on whose side you are on.
 Desperate people will use any means they can find available, whether one
agrees or disagrees with them.  They were driven to &quot;excess&quot; by
the causes that have set today's stage for the next performance.  So, when
one utters &quot;extreme&quot;, then one should review the causes.  Had
the causes been different, then the &quot;plot&quot; of this story would've
been different.  Injustice and unfairness are the causes that breed an extreme
effect.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If we want to change the situation and to save lives,
then we must demand from the UN, the US and the world at large that we want
justice, equality, fairness and no more lies.  Israel must be pressured
more than just by a tiny slap on the wrist.  Extremist Israeli groups and
Israeli terrorists must be treated as any other terrorist in the world.
 Why should they be given special treatment?  Basic truths are evident.
 What is wrong is wrong and what is right is right.  The torture of Palestinians
must be stopped, condemned and punishable in the world court.  Unauthorized
building should be halted.  The breaking of agreements must come with some
penalty on the Israeli side, for they are the ones who have the strength
and the upper hand.  They must be made to answer for trodding on the poor
Palestinian civilian population.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If the world does not support justice and fairness, then
they will cause the next explosion in the Middle East.  The effect of injustice
will be enormous. </FONT></P>
