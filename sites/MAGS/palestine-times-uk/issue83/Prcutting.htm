<P><FONT SIZE=+1>THE murderous terror attacks that eroded Britain's resolve
to continue its Mandate over Palestine and hastened the creation of Israel
were assisted by a Jewish spy operating inside British military headquarters
in Jerusalem. Now 81, but possessing an uncanny recall of those turbulent
years, David Shalom Rubovitz told The Times in an exclusive interview that
he felt no remorse, and that he had advised leaders of the Stern Gang, the
most bloodthirsty of the Jewish terror groups, to step up their campaign
against British targets.  &quot;I knew the mentality of the British. You
had to strike at them physically,&quot; said the former mole who was in
charge of the transport section at British headquarters in the King David
Hotel from 1945 until discharged in 1948, as his papers show, &quot;due
to the closing down of this HQ&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These settlements are obstructing the peace process and
tearing apart  the harmony of the landscape. The Holy Land, which ought
to be preserved  as a unique country, is quickly becoming yet another conglomeration
of  urban centers in a world not at all lacking in such ugly creations.
The whole world, including half of Israel, is against the settlements. Even
if Benjamin Netanyahu were to withdraw his troops from all of the  occupied
territories, these symbols of dominance and defiance would  always stir
memories of a painful occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>''Most voters in California do not know the religion of
all of the women  or of the men running,'' said Millie Loeb, a university
administrator  who is active in the women's Jewish community in Los Angeles.
''It's a  fluke that the people running (for the state office) at this moment
are Jewish. What isn't a  fluke is that you have women running for office.''
 Said Susan Mishler, active in local and statewide politics, ''That there
 are three Jewish women, or three Catholic women, is not the defining  thing.
That it's three women is the striking political phenomenon.''</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What happened at Deir Yassin that night is still debated
among Israeli  and Palestinian historians. But Meir Pael, one of Israel's
leading  military historians who also witnessed the battle, likens it to
the My Lai massacre of Vietnamese civilians by US troops. Between 110 and
250 people, mostly civilians, were killed at Deir  Yassin. Eager to boost
its brutal image, the Irgun claimed to have  killed 250. Arab leaders exaggerated
the atrocities on the radio to help  stiffen the resolve of their fighters.
But the chilling news had the  opposite effect, causing Arab families to
flee their villages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Israel-Like a massive earthquake followed by endless aftershocks,
 Mikhail Gorbachev's decision to allow Jews to leave the Soviet Union en
 masse nearly a decade ago has reshaped the political, cultural and  economic
landscape of Israel and continues to redefine the Jewish state. 	Both in
its massive scale -- nearly a million former Soviet immigrants  will have
arrived by 2000 -- and its astonishingly high educational and  professional
quality, the Russian influx is unlike any previous surge of  immigration
to Israel.. Even now, immigrants from the Soviet successor states continue
to land  at Ben-Gurion Airport at a clip of more than 150 a day, dwarfing
all  other current immigrant groups to Israel and altering neighborhoods,
 offices and the country's political calculus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To understand the meaning of the vituperative quarrel between
Yasser  Arafat's officials and the Islamicist movement, one need not jump
to any  conclusion about who killed Sharif. Certainly Israel's Mossad would
have  had a motive for wanting to do him in, and unfortunately, Hamas can
 count on a reflex of empathy among Palestinians when it asserts that the
 confessions by Hamas militants were extracted from them by Arafat's  torturers...Hamas's
public warnings to Arafat leave little room for ambiguity. A  statement
Wednesday from the group's violent Qassam Brigades not only  pledged attacks
against Israelis and Jews around the world but also  said: ''We warn the
Palestinian Authority and its security apparatus not  to touch the holy
fighter Adel Awadallah or to confront him in any way''  - Awadallah is sought
by Arafat's men as the prime suspect in the murder  of Sharif - ''and not
to carry out any campaigns against Hamas or the  Qassam Brigades.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The Palestinian authorities declared Monday that members
of  the radical Hamas group, and not Israel, killed the bomb-maker  Muhyiaddin
Sharif in Ramallah last week, and said they had arrested five  men involved.
The announcement was greeted with relief in Israel, where a high  security
alert has been in effect since Hamas threatened to retaliate  for the killing
with bombings. But members of Hamas's political leadership rejected the
assertion, and  the group's militant wing again called for violent strikes
against  Israel. A Hamas leader, Abdelaziz Rantisi, said in Gaza: ''Hamas
sticks to its  charges that Israel was responsible.'' A statement from its
military  wing called the Palestinian declaration ''lies'' and a ''hopeless
 attempt'' to save the stalled peace process.</FONT></P>
