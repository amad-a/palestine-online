    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The CIA has abandoned its efforts to persuade Israel and the Palestinians
    to renew security cooperation, further removing the Bush administration from the Middle
    East dispute. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The agency appears to have arrived at its decision to stop serving as
    messenger and mediator for two reasons: the six-month uprising which has destroyed
    Palestinian security cooperation with Israel; and the general resolve of the Bush
    administration to step back from the conflict. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We continue to believe the resumption of direct discussions,
    including the bilateral security cooperation, is a realistic step towards restoring trust
    and confidence between the parties,&quot; a US embassy spokesman in Tel Aviv said
    yesterday. </p>

  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Los Angeles Times, 22 March 2001 </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem-Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was convicted
    Wednesday of sexually assaulting and harassing two women, a verdict hailed by activists as
    a turning point for the treatment of Israeli women. </p>
    <font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Mordechai,
    56, emerged from the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court after hearing the verdict and told
    reporters that he is innocent. &quot;I will take all legal action to prove my
    innocence,&quot; said the highly decorated former general, who in 1999 ran for prime
    minister. </p>
    <font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>He
    cut his remarks short and sped away in a car when female demonstrators outside the
    courthouse began chanting, &quot;You cannot be raped into silence&quot; and other slogans.
    </p>
    <font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Mordechai,
    the most senior Israeli official ever convicted on sexual charges, later announced that he
    is suspending his membership in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, pending an appeal. He
    could receive a maximum of 14 years in prison when he is sentenced next month. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">RAMALLAH, West Bank- A senior Palestinian official cocked his finger at
    his nostrils. &quot;We are not just shooting ourselves in the foot,&quot; he said.
    &quot;We are shooting ourselves in the nose.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The official was referring to the Palestinian Authority's decision to shut
    down the West Bank and Gaza bureaus of al Jazeera satellite television station for what
    were seen by some as insults to Yasir Arafat's dignity.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Al Jazeera is a highly popular pan- Arab station based in Qatar with an
    avid following in the West Bank and Gaza, where many Palestinians disdain their own news
    media as unsubstantive or propagandistic.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The stated reason for the closing? Al Jazeera, in its promotional
    advertisements for a special series on Lebanon, has been playing and replaying some old
    film from Beirut. In the film clip, an opponent of Yasir Arafat is holding a poster of Mr.
    Arafat that is draped by a shoe. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The shoe is dangling in the face of the Palestinian leader.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;In our culture, showing someone your shoe is an insult,&quot; a
    Palestinian journalist said. &quot;You never want to sit with your shoe in someone's face.

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">WASHINGTON -- President Bush told visiting Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on
    Tuesday to ease the economic pressure Israel is imposing on Palestinians, and the White
    House warned that the 6-month-old violence could quickly escalate.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush and Sharon presented a public picture of agreement regarding U.S.
    ties with Israel and on the broad goals of Mideast peace and stability. Behind the scenes,
    however, the Bush administration was pressing Israel to lift curfews and closures that
    have stifled Palestinian economic activity and to refrain from building new settlements in
    the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush did not discuss the issues in public. A senior administration
    official said Bush raised the topics in an Oval Office meeting with Sharon.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We would urge all parties to do nothing at this stage that would
    make the already volatile situation in the region escalate,&quot; the administration
    official said. Bush urged Sharon to take steps &quot;to restore normal economic
    life,&quot; the official said, adding that Sharon outlined measures he is planning or has
    taken to ease the economic pressure on the Palestinians.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">WASHINGTON - Hoping to ease tensions throughout the Middle East, US
    officials yesterday put pressure on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to release more
    than $50 million in taxes owed to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The message was part of a broad theme urging the new Israeli leader to
    make economic concessions to the Palestinians as a way of defusing an increasingly
    volatile situation, US officials said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called on both Israel and the
    Palestinians to end the violence that has significantly stymied efforts to begin anew
    peace talks between the parties.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">''First and foremost, the violence must stop,'' Powell said at the annual
    policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel
    lobby in the United States.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In an apparent reference to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Powell said
    ''leaders have the responsibility to denounce violence, strip it of its legitimacy, stop
    it.'' </p>
