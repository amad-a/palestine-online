<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Misha&#146;al: Differences between Likud and
Labour merely tactical</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amman - PT </b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The head of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), Khalid Misha&#146;al said the Israeli political parties are united regarding the
rights of the Palestinian People. He added that the Zionist parties are united in their
objectives but differ in the tactics only.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Speaking to the <i>Palestine Times</i>, Mr. Misha&#146;al said the Likud
and Labour agree on the issues on the agenda of the final status negotiations with the
self-rule authority, namely, the future of Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements, the right of
return for Palestine refugees, the borders and cross-points, water and the Palestinian
State. Mr. Misha&#146;al stressed that a bet on the Labour Party pushing the negotiations
forward in a way that serves the Palestinian People is a losing bet and running after a
mirage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Mr. Misha&#146;al pointed out that when the Oslo process began, it
tackled the easy issues which made the people notice that the peace process was quickly
advancing. But when the negotiations reached the hot and important issues, the Peres
Labour government took a hard-line position which was evident in deactivating an agreement
on the redeployment of the Zionist troops in Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Commenting on the anxiety shown by the PA and some Arab officials over the
possibility of re-electing Netanyahu, the Hamas leader said the PA and many Arab
governments dropped the war option and adopted the &#147;peace settlement&#148; as a
strategic option. He added that they do not want to deal with Netanyahu, who pulled out
his gun. Instead, they find it easier to deal with the Labour Party which introduces a
flexible programme to the media although it does not differ from the Likud regarding the
actual position on the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Misha&#146;al pointed out that Labour is deluding the Palestinian
Authority when it talks about the possibility of establishing a Palestinian State. But,
Misha&#146;al argues, the State allowed by Labour is the one which has no real content
while the Likud rejects the &#147;State&#148; and insists on the self-rule entity. The
real difference between the Likud and the Labour is that the first agrees to give back 40%
of the West Bank to the Palestinians in the final settlement, while Labour is talking
about 50%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Misha&#146;al said Hamas does not prefer any Zionist party to another.
&#147;We are not interested in who wins in the elections. We do not expect anything good
from the Zionist Enemy, whether led by the Likud or by the Labour,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In reply to a question, Mr. Misha&#146;al said, &#147;We did not try and
will not try to influence the results of the Israeli elections. This is not of any
interest for us. We are not a part of the Zionist political structure. We are a part of
the Palestinian People who are victims of the Zionist Occupation and who are fighting to
restore and extract their rights from their enemy, regardless of who is in power in the
Jewish State.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres had accused Hamas of being the
reason for his losing the 1996 elections following the suicide bombings implemented by the
military wing of Hamas in retaliation of the assassination of the &#147;Engineer&#148;,
Yahya Ayyash, in January 1996.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Mr. Misha&#146;al argued that what made Peres lose the election to
Netanyahu was the hard-line and extreme policy adopted by the Labour government at the
time, not Hamas military operations. The Israeli Street was responsible for the election
of Netanyahu and they disappointed Peres in 1996. He added that Hamas resisted the Zionist
Occupation whether under the Labour or the Likud. Hamas fights in all times and against
all occupation governments, Misha&#146;al said. But he attributed the absence of Hamas
military activities during the last period to &#147;field circumstances&#148; and not to
any political accounts. &#147;The Islamic Resistance faces big challenges and therefore
the forms of resistance change according to the circumstances, but the will of resistance
is continuous,&#148; Misha&#146;al said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A communiqu� issued by Hamas following the Israeli elections had
described the newly elected prime minister Barak as &#147;a new professional terrorist
leader, who has exerted all efforts over many decades to chase, assassinate, or arrest our
people and their leaders in and out of Palestine.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>A view on Barak&#146;s electoral campaign which concentrated
on his role in the wars against the Arab states, the Palestinian Resistance, and against
our people proves that the Zionist General has assumed power in the Zionist State based on
his military history and his platform which in turn is based on extremism and arrogance.
This proves more that the Zionist Society is inclining more and more towards
extremism,&#148; Hamas said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas said Barak and Netanyahu have identical perspectives regarding the
Palestinian issue. It called on the Arab and Palestinian officials not to be optimistic
with the coming of Barak to power.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font> It is true that there are some differences between him and
Netanyahu in the manner and tactics, but they have identical objectives and perspectives.
Moreover, Barak stands on the far right of the Labour Party and he is an extremist hawk.
His hands are stained with the Palestinian blood. The platform he adopted concerning the
Palestinian track was very clear,&#148; Hamas said</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas reminded Arabs and Palestinians of the first speech delivered by
Barak after his victory. &#147; In his first speech he delivered after his winning he
asserted that the united Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Zionist state. He also
declared that the Occupation troops will never go back to the 1967 borders and that he
will never allow the presence of any Arab army west of the Jordan River. He said that he
would not dismantle the Jewish settlements, which will be kept under the Zionist
control.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It also reminded of the bloody history of the Labour. &#147;The Labour
Party has come back to power carrying a long history of aggression, oppression and
terrorism not to mention Rabin&#146;s policy of breaking our people&#146;s bones or Qana
massacre perpetrated by infamous terrorist Peres.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Settlers race to grab hilltops throughout West
Bank</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Jewish settlers, heeding an earlier call by
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to grab as many hilltops as possible lest they fall into
Palestinian hands, have been on the move in much of the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian and Israeli sources alike, the settlers, who are
supported and protected by the regular Israeli army, have been executing &#147;daily
missions&#148; to seize &#147;as much territory as possible&#148;, before any prospective
&#147;territorial settlement&#148; is reached in the context of the Oslo process,
particularly in light of Ehud Barak&#146;s becoming Israel&#146;s new Prime Minister.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The land-grab blitz was particularly stepped up following the signing of
the hapless Wye River memorandum, when Sharon made his infamous call to seize the
hilltops. Since then, the settlers, often at gunpoint, grabbed thousands of hectares in
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank districts of Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to data provided by the Israeli &#147;Peace Now Movement&#148;,
over 23 hilltop settlements were erected during the period from 23 October 1998 to 10
April 1999. The vast bulk of the new settlements and outposts are 1-5 kilometres from
existing settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Gaza, Jewish settlers seized over 80 hectares of privately owned
Palestinian land at the Gush Katiff settlements between 25 March and 25 April. Sixty more
hectares near the town of Rafah were declared slated for confiscation, apparently for the
expansion of the settlement of Moraj. All in all, over 35% of the entire area of the Gaza
Strip has now come under settlers&#146; control. Needless to say, the confiscated areas
include the best farm land in the Gaza Strip, and contains most of the increasingly scarce
water sources in the Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Hebron area, efforts by the settlers to seize &#147;as much land as
possible&#148; have been intensive and widespread. The National and Islamic Committee
against Land Grab reported in early May that over 500 hectares of land were seized in the
Hebron district since the signing of the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A considerable land grab has been taking place around the town of Yatta,
15 miles south-west of Hebron, where over 25 hectares were confiscated in the month of
April alone. Twenty additional hectares were seized a few miles south-west of the nearby
town of Sammu, where a new settlement is being built. In addition, hundreds of hectares of
farmland belonging to Palestinian farmers along the &#147;front line areas&#148; were
confiscated. This land is located mainly adjacent to the former armistice line between the
West Bank and pre-1967 Palestine, which suggests that Israelis are seeking to push the
borders eastward by a few kilometres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the town of Hebron itself, over 100 hectares of privately owned land
belonging to villagers from Shuyokh (10 miles north-east of Hebron) and Sair (14 miles
north-west of Hebron) were seized. The land grab around Kiryat Arba&#146;a is aimed at
expanding the settlement and creating an industrial zone there. It is also aimed at
creating a &#147;Jewish metropolitan centre&#148;, linking Kiryat Arba&#146;a and other
Jewish settlements around Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Normally, the settlers employ sinister means to arrogate the land, such as
spraying lethal pesticides to prevent Palestinian livestock from grazing. Moreover, they
usually root out mature olive trees, ostensibly to obliterate any signs reminding the
beholder that the land belongs to Palestinian farmers and was actually stolen from them by
force. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Bethlehem area, over 220 hectares were declared slated for
confiscation for the opening of a new bypass road circumventing Arab villages in the area.
That road, which the Israelis claimed was agreed upon in the Wye agreement, will link the
settlement of Efrat with the planned settlement of Har Homa at Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlement of Efrat itself has been steadily &#147;creeping&#148; at
the expense of the neighbouring Palestinian village of Artas (pop. 10,000), just like the
rest of the settlements, known as the Gush Etzion, extending between the northern
outskirts of Hebron and Bethlehem. These settlements have expanded by 50% since the
signing of the Oslo Accords five years ago, and continue to expand at a fast pace, with
new blocks of flats and red-tiled apartments being built almost round the clock.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Ramallah, an exceptionally aggressive campaign of land grab has been
going on for the last few weeks, particularly since March, when the outgoing Israeli
premier Benyamin Netanyahu decided to go for early elections.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least 200 hectares of Palestinian land was seized from the two villages
of Deir Qeddis and Shabin, 20 miles west of Ramallah, along the armistice line. Again, as
in the Hebron area, the goal of the Zionists seems to be pushing the borders eastward as
much as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Nablus, prefabricated houses and mobile homes were erected on land
belonging to the villages of Yitma and al Sawiya, apparently for the purpose of expanding
the settlement of Rahalim.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, another settlement&#151;Brakha&#151;was being expanded at the
expense of the adjacent Palestinian village of Deir al-Hatab. A few miles away, Israeli
bulldozers last month pulverized tens of hectares of farmland and rooted out thousands of
olive trees, belonging to villagers from Asala and Nabi Elyas.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Settler population on the rise</b><br>
The frenzied onslaught of settlement expansion, particularly in the West Bank, is aimed at
increasing the settler population from 160,000 to a potential 200,000, which would create
a &#147;solid and irreversible <i>fait accompli</i>&#148; in the area. Moreover, a key
goal of the current spate of land grab is to enclose Palestinian autonomous areas to
prevent their expansion beyond the 10% of extra territory granted them in the second phase
of redeployment stipulated in the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settler onslaught is in total harmony with Jewish settlement ambitions
in the West Bank, mainly &#147;repopulating Judea and Samaria with Jews,&#148; as one of
the settlers&#146; leaders put it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Peace Now, approximately 1,680 new settlement units were
built in 1996: 1,900 in 1997 and 3,900 in 1998. The figure for this year is expected to
top 5,000.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, these &#147;facts on the ground&#148; are likely to make
any prospective &#147;final status settlement&#148; between Israel and the Palestinians
&#147;fragile and volatile&#148;, if not impossible altogether. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Sheikh Yasin says more must be done to liberate
prisoners </font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yasin urged &quot;all active Palestinian forces&quot; to put up a unified and concerted
effort to bring about freedom for the estimated 3000 Palestinian prisoners in Zionist
detention.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The vast majority of the prisoners are members of the Islamic resistance
movements such as Hamas. <br>
Speaking on the 10th annual anniversary of his imprisonment, Yasin said the prisoners
cause needed an active campaign on the part of all Palestinians, including action on the
popular and street levels.<br>
Yasin praised the role of human rights organizations in caring for the prisoners and
following up Zionist repression and maltreatment of them.<br>
Moreover, Yasin called on the United Nations to treat Palestinian prisoners in Zionist
jails as prisoners of war (POWs).<br>
Yasin pointed out that the average Palestinian prisoner in Zionist jails lives in constant
anxiety as a result of the mistreatment he and his family are subject to. <br>
Meanwhile, a report published last month by the PA Office of Prisoners Affairs revealed
that as many as 150 Palestinian prisoners have died since the Zionist seizure of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in June, 1967.<br>
The report pointed out that the 150 prisoners died as a result of inadequate or no medical
care and malnutrition. <br>
In addition to malnutrition and absence of a meaningful medical care, the prisoners who
died had also undergone physical and psychological torture, including hand-cuffing or
prolonged periods, reaching many months, leg-fettering, daily beating, and solitary
confinement in squalid condition.<br>
The report said the prisoners didn't die directly of torture but of illnesses caused in
part by torture, which would have been treated if medical care had been available.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Human rights groups in the West Bank and Gaza Strip accused the<br>
Israeli occupation authorities of &quot;criminal negligence&quot; in the death last month
of a Palestinian political detainee at a Zionist prison in Bearsheba, south of the
1948-Occupied Palestine.</p>

<p>According to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), Shadi Saqer abu Dahruj,
21, died on 18 May inside his cell at the desert prison in Bearsheba, apparently due to
the lack of medical care.<br>
The PCHR pointed out that Dahruj had been suffering from a cardiac problem, adding that
the solitary confinement he was subjected to at the Zionist jail &quot;undoubtedly
exacerbated his condition.&quot;<br>
The PCHR quoted Dahruj's family as saying that Israeli prison officials refused an urgent
request from his cellmate for urgent medical care.<br>
The Bearsheba prison is notorious for its medical negligence of Palestinian detainees.<br>
In 1997, another Palestinian detainee, Riad Odwan, died of an acute illness after prison
authorities refused to transfer to hospital. <br>
Since 1967, scores of Palestinian detainees lost their lives at Israeli jails due to lack
of medical care.<br>
According to Jewish religious laws, it is not permissible to offer a non-Jew medical help,
even if he or she faces the danger of death. </p>

<font FACE="Arial">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza-PT</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ayman Abdul Qader al Amsi is the latest victim of the enduring state of
lawlessness and corruption permeating throughout Yasser Arafat&#146;s Palestinian
Authority. His story, say many Palestinian lawyers and jurists, is only symptomatic of a
deeper and much wider <i>modus operandi</i> in which the administration of justice
throughout the autonomous enclaves is entrusted to mostly ignorant junior police officers,
with little or no formal training in jurisprudence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 11 May, Amsi, 32, was rushed to the Shifa hospital in downtown Gaza
with a massive brain hemorrhage, apparently resulting from direct hits with hard objects
on the skull while in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Squad (CIS), one of the
numerous security agencies responsible to Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Amsi&#146;s relatives, he was subjected to intensive episodes
of torture at the hands of CIS interrogators, which eventually caused the hemorrhage and
made him lose consciousness, actually rendering him clinically dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For its part, the police claims Amsi attempted to commit suicide after he
was interrogated on charges of theft and attempted rape at the village of Tira across the
Green line.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, human rights organizations, including the Palestinian Human
Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG), disputed police accounts, and pointed out that the arrest
<i>per se</i> was illegal since the defendant was never brought before a court of law nor
arraigned before a judge or formally charged of any wrongdoing.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli court exonerated him</b></u><br>
The story began on 11 February when Amsi was arrested by the Israeli police in Kfar Sava
after a woman at the nearby Arab village of Tira claimed he had stolen her money and raped
her two years earlier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amsi was subjected to a thorough investigation and interrogation, which
found that there was no evidence linking him to the crime. Indeed, this conclusion was
later corroborated by forensic and genetic tests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, after examining his employment records at the village at the
time of the incident, it was established that he had worked in a place farther away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of the above, Amsi was given back his identity card and asked to
return to his work.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two weeks later, Amsi returned to Gaza to attend his grandfather&#146;s
funeral, only to be arrested by a handful of CIS agents who whisked him away to their
headquarters in Gaza to answer questions on the Tira crime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amsi insisted from the outset that he was innocent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He produced an affidavit issued by the Israeli police attesting to his
innocence, but to no avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His relatives, including the Mukhtar (clan notable), contacted several top
PA security officials such as Rashid Abu Shibbak, deputy-chief of the Gaza branch of the
Preventive Security Force, who reportedly declined to intervene because of the
&#147;delicate and sensitive relationship between the various security agencies.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several legislative council members were also recruited to help, but
without result.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They asked for money</b></u><br>
After a month and a half in CIS cells, the General Investigation Department (GID)
intimated to Amsi that if he agreed to pay the sum of $7,000, he could be set free. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Amsi&#146;s cousin, Muhammed, the GID later contacted the
family and asked rather explicitly for the money, warning that he wouldn&#146;t be freed
from jail unless the sum was paid in full. The cousin Muhammed (not the real name) said
that the GID later reduced the sum to $2,000.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that after it became clear they were after money, &#147;We
conveyed the message to them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, that (disclosing police demand for money to PA officials and the
media) proved to be risky for the family and for Amsi himself. Infuriated by his audacious
step to expose their corruption, CIS agents reportedly beat him mercilessly on the head
until he lost consciousness. Worried about having a dead body before their eyes, the CIS
summoned a local physician, called Khalid Rustum, who, realizing the seriousness of the
case, recommended that he be transferred immediately to hospital.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Signs of torture all over the body</b></u><br>
According to Amsi&#146;s medical report, issued by the Shifa hospital, he was brought to
hospital on 11 May with bruises all over his body, enlarged pupils of the eyes, and
reddish skin around the neck. Moreover, the report pointed out that Amsi was completely
unconscious and unresponsive to external effects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian human rights group, known as al-Qanun, issued a statement
saying, &#147;Amsi was transferred to hospital after he was subjected to severe torture at
the hands of CIS interrogators.&#148; The statement further pointed out that there was no
legal base for Amsi&#146;s arrest and continued detention since he was cleared of any
wrong-doing by the Israeli police and was attested to his good conduct by the municipal
council of Tira, where he had been working for the last 13 years as a sanitation worker.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, al-Qanun expressed concern for Amsi&#146;s life, and voiced its
condemnation of all practices of torture by PA security operatives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement demanded that a thorough investigation be carried out to
determine the circumstances surrounding the arrest, detention and torture of Ayman
al-Amsi, including trying all persons involved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement also demanded that unmistakable instructions be issued to
all interrogators whereby they must stop the employment of torture against detainees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another human rights organization, the Independent Commission on Human
Rights, also condemned the torture of Amsi at the hands of the CIS, saying that all the
documents it was able to obtain showed beyond doubt that he was subjected to various forms
of torture while in police custody.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Commission also condemned all forms of flagrant incarceration and
brutal maltreatment of detainees, and demanded the PA to seriously look into the case.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jabali: <i>Amsi tried to kill himself</i></b></u><br>
Gaza Police Chief, Ghazi al-Jabali, dismissed that Amsi was not tortured and that he
attempted to commit suicide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He claimed that Jabali was &#147;in good health&#148;, adding that Amsi
had committed a theft and another honour-related crime at the village of Tira. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In response to Jabali&#146;s remarks, which were made during a press
conference on the matter, the Amsi family issued a statement accusing Jabali of falsifying
the facts and of trying to whitewash the crimes of the interrogators.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement said that everything Jabali said was an &#147;utter lie from
beginning to end.&#148;</p>

brutality</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Occupied Jerusalem-</b> Gazi Hamad, editor-in-chief of the Gaza-based
Islamist weekly al Risala was released from police custody, thirty six hours after he had
been arrested for publishing an article on alleged torture of a Gazan citizen at the hands
of police interrogators.<br>
Two other members of the Risala editorial board were still detained for the same reason.<br>
Hamad said he was arrested without an arrest warrant from the attorney-general's office,
adding that the arrest was aimed at &quot;silencing us and forcing us to exercise
self-censorship.&quot;<br>
&quot;They (the Palestinian Authority) are trying to bully us into submission to their
undemocratic reign,&quot; said Hamad.<br>
Last month, al Risala published a detailed report on the alleged torture Ayman al Amsi by
agents of the Criminal Investigation Squad (CIS) in connection with a theft and rape crime
at the village of Tira across the green line in Palestine earlier this year.<br>
However, blood and genetic tests showed there was no connection between Amsi and the crime
of which he was accused.<br>
Despite that, PA police chief Ghazi Jabali insisted that Amsi was guilty. <br>
Last month, Amsi was transferred to hospital in Gaza with brain hemorrhage, which human
rights organizations said was caused by torture in police custody.<br>
For his part, Jabali claimed Amsi tried to commit suicide, a charge strongly denied by his
family. </p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority police had also arrested two Islamist activists in Gaza on
suspicion of carrying out acts of resistance against Zionist occupation targets.<br>
Palestinian sources in Gaza said Khalil al Sakani and Sa'ad al Arabid were arrested on 22<sup>nd</sup>
of May at the hands of the Mukhabarat General Intelligence.<br>
The sources said Arabid was believed to be the right-hand man of Hamas fighter Muhammad
Deif.<br>
The PA often acts at Israel's beck and call in matters pertaining to Hamas and other
Palestinian resistance movements.<br>
The PA detains hundreds of Islamist activists, mainly to receive a certificate of good
conduct from the Zionist regime and the American Central Intelligence.<br>
On the other hand, the Zionist Chief of Staff, Shaul Mofaz, reportedly met with Muhammad
Dahlan, Chief of the Gaza branch of the PA Preventive Security to discuss reviving
cooperation against Palestinian resistance movements, particularly Hamas.<br>
According to Israeli sources, the previously-unannounced meeting took place took at the
Erez Check point, at the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, just inside the Palestinian
territory seized by the Zionists in 1948.<br>
The Israeli Hebrew paper, Yedeot Ahranot, reported last month that the new Israeli
leadership was keen at reviving and enhancing &quot;security coordination&quot; with the
PA against &quot;terrorism.&quot;<br>
In fact, security coordination between the PA and the Zionist regime has never completely
ceased, even as the outgoing Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu unilaterally suspended the
Wye River memorandum, signed under US President Bill Clinton's auspices on 23 October, and
launched a widespread campaign of Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank.</p>

Jerusalem<br>
</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</b></p>

<p>Zionist police on Thursday 27 May brutally repressed a peaceful Palestinian protest in
East Jerusalem, injuring several Palestinians including Palestinian lawmakers and
newly-elected Arab Knesset members.<br>
The police, some of whom were mounting horses, dragged protesters to the ground and beat
them mercilessly, preventing them from reaching the site of a planned new Jewish
settlement at Ras el Amud in the heart of East Jerusalem.<br>
Among the people beaten and injured was Faisal Husseini, a member of the PLO executive
committee.<br>
Abdul Malik Dahamshe, leader of the United Arab list which won five seats in the recent
Israeli elections, described police behavior as &quot;provocative, brutal and extremely
violent.&quot;<br>
&quot;They wouldn't use this kind of violence if the protesters were Jews,&quot; said
Dahamshe.<br>
Husseini vowed to continue the protests until settlement activities at Ras el Amud were
terminated.<br>
Israeli Prime Minister-elected Ehud Barak, however, seems to be very soft on settlement
expansion.<br>
Last month, he refused to promise the leftist Meretz party, a potential coalition partner
in the coming Israeli government, to put a freeze on Jewish settlement expansion in the
West Bank. <br>
Irving Moscovic, the Jewish millionaire who bankrolls Jewish settlement<br>
activities in Jerusalem and Hebron, said that it was unlikely that Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak will bar him from building a Jewish settlement at Ras el Amud in
the heart of East Jerusalem.<br>
Moscovic pointed out that Barak was the &quot;godfather of Ras el Amud settlement,&quot;
adding that the elected Israeli premier had personally endorsed the blue-prints for that
settlement and that he was eager to see the old town of Jerusalem being repopulated by
Jews.<br>
Moscovic discounted settlers&#146; fears that Barak might seek to place certain
restrictions on the construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.<br>
He argued that Barak himself promised during his election campaign that he wouldn't
terminate settlement activities anywhere in the West Bank and especially in the Jerusalem
area. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> Hamas and Islamic Jihad supporters easily
defeated supporters of the secular PLO in the student election which took place at
Jerusalem&#146;s Al Quds University Tuesday, 18 May.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to college sources, the Islamic bloc al-Wafa (faithfulness)
received 28 seats of the 51-seat student parliament. The Fatah bloc, who support
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, won 20 seats while the three remaining seats
went to a leftist coalition representing secular Palestinian groups opposed to the Oslo
process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As many as 4,000 students took part in the election which observers
believe represents a parameter of Palestinian public opinion trends.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this year, the Islamist movement defeated Arafat&#146;s supporters
in college elections at major Palestinian universities in the West Bank and Gaza. Pundits
in Palestine opine Islamist gains are attributed to two main factors: mass disenchantment
with the Oslo peace process and Yasser Arafat&#146;s repressive and corruption-ridden
administration; and growing Islamic awareness among the Palestinian masses. </p>

cleansing against Palestinians&#148;</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- Aides of the former mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy
Kollek, have admitted that the municipality of Jerusalem under Kollek adopted a systematic
policy of discrimination and ethnic cleansing against Palestinians in the Eastern part of
the city.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amire Cheshin and Avi Melamed, along with Bill Hutman, a journalist who
had covered Jerusalem for many years, said in a book published today that Kollek used a
ruthless quota system to curb the ability of Arabs to build legally in East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the authors, the &#147;housing quotas&#148; for Arab
neighbourhoods had nothing to do with urban planning considerations, but were essentially
meant to encourage Arabs to leave Jerusalem and limit the Arab population at 28.8%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The authors said the quotas were outlined in a 1993 document of the
city&#146;s planning department that the authors culled from Kollek&#146;s personal files.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Allowing too many new homes in Arab neighbourhoods would mean
too many Arab residents in the city,&#148; has been the essence of the municipality and
government policy, wrote the authors.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The idea was to move as many Jews as possible into East
Jerusalem, and move as many Arabs as possible out of the city entirely.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The authors described the policy toward Arabs as &#147;a ruthless policy,
if only for the fact that the needs (to say nothing of the rights) of Palestinian
residents were ignored.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel is still adopting a policy of ethnic cleansing against Palestinians
in East Jerusalem, mainly in the form of confiscating residency rights and demolishing
residential Arab homes in the city. </p>

&#147;reasonable physical and psychological pressure&#148; against a Palestinian detainee.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Al-Bayed&#146;s lawyer, Shabak interrogators routinely and
continually torture him while his hands are handcuffed and his legs fettered.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, a filthy-smelling garbage bag is forced on his head for weeks.</p>

as beating sensitive parts of the body.</p>

Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat of being &#147;an autocrat who makes sure

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shubaki, who was speaking in a seminar in Dura, 15 kilometres south-west

and autocracy because of his &#147;symbolic status&#148; and &#147;the deep respect he
enjoys among Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, when asked if he considered Arafat to be above or under the law,
Shubaki dodged the question, saying Arafat shouldn&#146;t be above the law.</p>

a report published on 25 May in the American newspaper, &quot; USA Today,&quot; on an
alleged secret agreement on the future status of Jerusalem between Israeli Prime

in return for having control over 150,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem and over Muslim
holy places in the town.<br>

&quot;baseless,&quot; adding that Barak didn't have time reach agreements since he won the
