<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From Khalid Amayreh in Hebron (West Bank)</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Caution, ambivalence and a certain degree of apathy have characterized
Palestinian reactions to the election of Isaeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak as the
Jewish State&#146;s Prime Minister.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, while the Palestinian Authority (PA) expressed relief at Israeli
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanayhu&#146;s political downfall, very few ordinary
Palestinians lauded Ehud Barak&#146;s triumph, suggesting that Palestinians do not see any
real difference between Netanyahu and Barak on fundamental issues pertaining to the
Palestinian-Israeli strife.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA Chairman Yasser Arafat said in a terse statement after it became clear
that Barak was poised to become Prime Minister that he hoped the new Labor-led government
would recommit Israel to the cause of peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 18 May, Arafat called Barak to convey his congratulations to him on his
electoral victory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA Chairman, however, did not appear outspoken in his praise for the
new change in Israel, which suggests that he did not think the downfall of Netanyahu and
the triumph of Barak was going to trigger a genuine breakthrough in the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Barak&#146;s recalcitrant statements during his election victory
speech at dawn on 18 May, in which he made it clear that he would not offer the
Palestinians any fundamental concessions on the West Bank, apparently dampened PA
expectations of the new Israeli premier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak&#146;s hard-line speech also ostensibly made PA officials modify and
somewhat qualify their erstwhile disproportionate praise for the new Israeli leader.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(Barak said he would observe four red lines concerning the peace process
with the Palestinians, including that of Jerusalem remaining under Israeli sovereignty, no
return to the 1967 borders, no dismantling of Jewish settlements, and not allowing any
&#147;foreign&#148; armies west of the River Jordan.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Freih Abu Maddin, the PA minister of justice, reacted to Barak&#146;s
&#147;set of Nos&#148;, describing them as &#147;dangerous&#148;, &#147;coming too
soon&#148;, and &#147;auguring very bad for the future.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;One would understand such statements during the election campaign,
but repeating them now is dangerous and unacceptable.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Maddin said it was clear that the declared stance of Barak was a
&#147;non-starter&#148; for the resumption of the peace process, adding that &#147;no
Palestinian could ever come to terms with such conditions&#148;, which he said, &#147;were
a mere carbon copy of Netanyahu&#146;s policies and positions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other PA officials, who probably could not resist or hide their relief at
the political disappearance of Netanyahu, initially cordially welcomed the new
&#147;political revolution&#148; in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yasser Abed Rabbu, the PA minister of Culture and Information, opined that
the defeat of Netanyahu was a defeat for &#147;all morbid rightist ideas&#148; and &#147;a
clear proof that the Israeli people are opting for peace.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>The fact that Netanyahu is gone is in itself a reason for
optimism,&#148; said Abed Rabbu.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abed Rabbu made his somewhat euphoric remarks before Barak&#146;s election
victory speech at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv on 18 May.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Legislative Council speaker Ahmed Qrei also spoke along the same lines,
arguing that Barak would set the peace process back on track.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qrei, perhaps out of ignorance of Barak and the Labor Party, dismissed
Barak&#146;s statements as &#147;post-election rhetoric that ought not to be taken
seriously.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the overall tone of the Palestinians&#146; official reactions
suggested that the PA was more relieved by Netanyahu&#146;s downfall than heartened by
Barak&#146;s victory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This was apparent in the tone of PA official Sa&#146;eb Ereikat, who
called Barak&#146;s avowed red lines &#147;unacceptable&#148; since they are themselves
&#147;Palestinian red lines&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unlike other PA leaders, who seemed to be getting out of their skins to
laud the former Israeli general, Ereikat opined that &#147;we must wait to see
Barak&#146;s actions, not just his words.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Barak must demonstrate that he is committed to the peace
process,&#148; said Ereikat.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>This means that before going to the final status talks, he
will have to carry out the remaining phase of the Wye River memorandum, release
Palestinian prisoners, open the safe crossing between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
open the seaport in Gaza&#133;and above all, order an immediate halt to the settlement
expansion, confiscation of land and demolition of houses.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is unlikely that Barak, who had voiced serious reservations about the
original Oslo Accords, will hasten to carry out this long list of agreements just to prove
to the PA that he is serious about peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The former general may well argue that even Rabin and Peres did not go
that far, and that there was no reason that he should go any farther. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamist reactions</b></u><br>
For its part, the Islamist opposition viewed Barak&#146;s &#147;recalcitrant
statements&#148; as a vindication of the Islamists&#146; long-standing position that Barak
and Netanyahu were merely two sides of the same coin as far as Palestinian rights were
concerned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It is true that Barak, when compared to Netanyahu, may look the
lesser of the two evils to many Palestinians, but it would be na�ve and dangerous to give
him the benefit of the doubt since all Zionist faces are hostile to our rights,&#148; said
Sheikh Yasin in a telephone interview from his home in Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He indicated though that he was worried that Barak might succeed in
cajoling some Arab countries, especially in the Gulf region, to resume the normalization
process with Israel, virtually at no price, as Shimon Peres had done, rather successfully.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, he urged the Palestinian leadership as well as Arab regimes
&#147;not to be deceived again by a new illusion called Barak.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak and Netanyahu, he said, were like tweedledum and tweedledee, and
Barak&#146;s positions were not really different from those of Netanyahu.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A communiqu� issued by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) described
Barak as a new professional terrorist. &#147;The victory of the terrorist Ehud Barak has
never and will never change anything about the nature of the Zionist project which is
based on expansion, hegemony, and oppression. This was asserted by Barak more than once
during his election campaign which marketed a platform similar to the Likud&#146;s one
without any political differences. This platform does not change the hostile and
aggressive nature of the Zionist society against our people and nation,&#148; Hamas said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ordinary Palestinians generally welcomed Netanyahu&#146;s defeat but
greeted Barak&#146;s victory with caution and a great deal of skepticism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This circumspect posture stems mainly from the realization on the part of
most Palestinians that it was the Labor Party that first adopted the policy of implanting
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We should not go into rhapsody welcoming Barak, whose hands are
stained with our blood and who still denies us the right to freedom and
self-determination,&#148; said a Bethlehem cab driver, who added with a whiff of cynicism
that &#147;if our leadership thinks he is the long-awaited lark of peace, then we may as
well wait for more years to witness his wonderful works.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Israeli Elections: Lessons and Options</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from a few enthusiasts, most observers in the Arab world of the
recent Israeli elections are not optimistic. Senior Palestinian Authority (PA) officials,
including Nabil Sha&#146;at and Hanan Ashrawi, were clearly cautious in their assessment
of the prospects of peace under Barak. It is widely accepted that the change the recent
Israeli election has brought and promises to bring to the Knesset and to Israeli political
life in general is not the outcome of a shift in Israeli public opinion in favour of a
more lenient negotiating position<i> vis-�-vis</i> the PA. Such a change is more likely
to be the outcome of a referendum over Benyamin Netanyahu&#146;s character, attitude and
domestic policy. If any external issues were of significance to the Israeli electorate,
these might have included the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and the deteriorating
relations between Israel and the United States of America. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is of course not to say that Israeli Prime Minister elect Barak will
not seek to resume the extremely stalled negotiations with the Palestinians. He will
definitely seek to do so, as this is one of his electoral promises. But he will not be
under any public pressure, compared to that generated by the growing passion against
keeping troops in South Lebanon, to offer any significant concessions to the Palestinians.
At least on all major issues, such as Jerusalem, the settlements, the borders and the
refugees, Barak maintains an almost identical position as his predecessor. His position is
almost identical because while maintaining things &#145;mostly&#146; as they are, Barak
may be more capable than Netanyahu of making marginal face-saving gestures at the PA.
These may include additional, very limited re-deployment in exchange for more security
guarantees, the removal of some insignificant settlement posts, such as those established
recently by settlers from nearby officially recognized and government-sponsored
settlements, and permitting Orient House to continue functioning in the eastern part of
the Holy City. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent Israeli elections had, however, been very enlightening. On the
one hand they shed light on the unique domestic situation of this society of immigrant
nations. This particular election has exposed more than any previous one the growing rifts
along ethnic and ideological divides. Apart from the Arab minority, which is indeed a
sizeable and potentially influential minority, Israelis can roughly be said to belong to
three major Zionist camps: the secularist left, the religious right and the utilitarian
Russian. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first camp, which in this election was represented by Barak&#146;s
&#147;One Israel&#148;, is the one that identifies most with the original Zionist
ideology. This camp is an extension of the European, socialist and secularist pioneers who
established the Jewish State in Palestine more than 50 years ago. Religion for the
affiliates of this camp is less than secondary, perhaps no more than a tool used when some
form of metaphysical justification of oppression is needed. A mix of Jewish nationalism,
socialism and secularism is what constitutes the backbone of this camp. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second camp comprises the religious Jews, both Sephardis and
Ashkenazis, for whom classic Jewish doctrines, interpreted to serve the ambitions of
modern Zionism, take precedence over all other considerations. The leaders of this camp go
as far as claiming to speak in the name of the Lord, and would therefore have no
hesitation to object to the &#145;norms&#146; of Israel&#146;s democracy if and when they
are found to clash with the wishes of the Divine. When Deri, leader of the Sephardic
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, was indicted by an Israeli court for corruption, a Shas grand
Rabbi proclaimed him innocent in the eyes of God despite having been found guilty by a
court of law. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third camp, which comprises what has become known as the Russians, is
a club to which belong those who came from the former Soviet Union. Most of these
immigrants believe that Israel is not the promised land but a transit station to the real
promised land in America. These Israelis have no ideological ties with the Jewish State to
which they were forced to migrate after the United States shut its doors in their faces in
the early 1990s. Relying on their electoral power, the Russians seek to serve the
interests of their community by forging alliances with whoever promises to deliver and is
capable of doing so. In the 1996 election, their votes carried Netanyahu to the
premiership; in the most recent one, they favoured Barak. Their eyes are set on the
Interior Ministry, which had been the prerogative of their foes in Shas. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the midst of all of this, the 1948 Palestinians, commonly referred to
as the Israeli Arabs, have emerged as a political power to reckon with. With ten seats in
the Knesset, the Arabs may be invited to join a coalition government. They may not find it
opportune yet to do so this time, but it is definitely a significant step along the path
of empowerment. They may even be found to be an important player at some future stage when
their votes in the Knesset may help bring down a government in crisis. The exercise
undertaken by Dr. Azmi Bishara is no less significant. He, or another Arab candidate, may
in a future election be capable of forcing a second round of elections, the aversion of
which would necessitate conceding some demands to his camp. This is, of course, in case
the election system does not change. But even if it does, there are clear signs of
awareness on the part of the Arabs in Israel of the political power they possess and the
potential influential role they may be able to play. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What can the Palestinian Authority learn from the Israeli elections? Very
much indeed. For one, Barak&#146;s determination, which seems to enjoy almost unanimous
support, to withdraw Israeli troops from South Lebanon is an example of how an external
matter may become a daily preoccupation for the majority of Israelis. The cost of
maintaining control over a narrow strip of land, supposed to be a necessary measure to
guarantee the security of Israeli northern towns, has haunted Israelis and changed their
perceptions. They would rather now give up the security zone, and even enter into
negotiations with Syria, which in turn may lead to giving up the Golan Heights or part of
them. The Israelis simply cannot afford to keep losing young men no matter how small their
proportion compared with the Lebanese losses. Thanks to the resistance by Hizbullah and
other Lebanese resistance groups, Lebanon will eventually liberate its land and Syria may
eventually regain control of its territory that has been under Israeli occupation since
1967. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is the lesson the PA should learn. In other more explicit language,
the Palestinian Authority should relax its security measures so as to permit Palestinians
who wish to avenge the confiscation of their land, the demolition of their houses or the
killing of their sons and daughters by Israeli troops or settlers to do so. Israel&#146;s
security should be linked to Palestinian security. If Israel is capable of, and gets away
with, terrorizing the Palestinians, no Palestinian reaction to such terrorism should be
hampered or foiled. Just as the Lebanese government sides with its people in the South and
blesses their resistance until the land is liberated, similarly the Palestinian Authority
has no honourable option other than siding with its people by forcing the Israelis to
refrain from all provocations. This is the only way settlement building and expansion will
cease, and this is the only way Israelis will think many times over before they consider
demolishing a house or a water reservoir or destroying an olive grove or vineyard. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">We Need A United Front Immediately!</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shihadeh*</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was quite a disappointment for those few who entertained the thought
that the election of Ehud Barak could bring peace to the Palestinians. His rejection of
dismantling the settlements and strengthening his hold on Jerusalem should convince the
skeptics that peace will never come through any Zionist leadership, but only through our
combined front to frustrate the Zionist dreams. There is no &#147;Third Way&#148; or
fourth way, for that matter, but only one way, namely our united progressive front for the
liberation of Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe we urgently need to solicit the combined efforts of the
Palestinian masses to form a very wide front that can absorb all Palestinians who believe
in the liberation of Palestine. Such a front should have no political ideology or
religious character, but a military and political struggle for the liberation of
Palestine. If we do differ in political ideology or religious affiliations, and we do
indeed, we should postpone such differences until after liberation. We should be smart
enough to realize that different fractionalization of our efforts can only pour into the
Zionist advantage. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have been subjected to small doses of hope through various meetings and
conferences that adopted such a strategy, but so far we have failed to realize such
intentions into a practical and progressive movement. It might sound ironic, but I call
for some kind of a new conference that should be held somewhere in the Western world, so
as to avoid becoming a movement that follows the policy of any Arab regime, as total
independence in our decisions should become a very essential lesson that we should learn
from the past. Arafat and his supporters have unfortunately become the defenders of
Israel&#146;s security, while Israel is exploiting such weakness to the maximum so as to
Judaize the entire West Bank and keep it as a collection of ghettoes under Israel&#146;s
hegemony. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the most optimistic expectations, the future of the so-called
Palestinians State, in accordance with Oslo and the Wye river agreement, can only allow
the Palestinians to live in not more than 10% of Palestine when our people used to own
more than 90% in retrospect. Even then, this 10% is dissected into small discontinuous
ghettoes while inter-ghetto movement is subject to Israeli checkpoints. Our refugees will
remain living in their sub-human conditions and under the mercy of the Arab regimes as
there is no hope under the present agreement for any repatriation or compensation.
Therefore the &#147;wait and see&#148; policy is nothing more than expended useful time
that should be used immediately to unify our efforts. I beseech our opposition to start
global organizations for our Palestinian people in order to start the struggle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our people have proven time after time that they are capable of meeting
any challenge; it was only the defeatism of our leaders that has led us to the miserable
status quo. Are there any of our people listening to my call? If so, let&#146;s start the
ball rolling. </p>

</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Few Palestinian journalists have savoured the international political
limelight in the way that Nasser el-Din Nashashibi has. For more than five decades he
covered from very close quarters the persecution of his people. Hosted and toasted by
kings, presidents, prime ministers and revolutionaries, he acquired throughout his lengthy
career an astonishing wealth of information and experiences. One of these, he recalls,
took place on 25 June 1982.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On that day, columns of Israeli tanks began to move on the besieged
Palestinian strongholds in West Beirut. This was after weeks of intense aerial bombings
that failed to break their resistance. The political and strategic aim of the attack was
apparently to destroy the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) and eliminate it as a
principal player in the Middle East conflict. It was at this point, according to
Nashashibi, the Saudi monarch, Fahd ibn Abdul Aziz, telephoned the White House and
demanded to speak to President Reagan. His words to the American leader were clear and to
the point: &#147;Am I required to go to Mecca and declare to the people from the Holy
Mosque that American aircraft, missiles and bombs are the weapons used by Israel to invade
Lebanon and kill thousands of women and children?&#148;<sup>1</sup> As the story goes,
Reagan did not only promise to contact Menachem Begin but, moreover, put an immediate end
to the killings. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, neither the threat by the Saudi king nor the intervention of
the American president was enough to prevent the massacre of thousands more during the
long, hot summer of 1982. Since then, Israel has continued to illegally occupy Lebanese
territory. At the same time, it has increased its willful and indiscriminate attacks
against Lebanese civilian and resistance &#147;targets&#148; as well as Palestinian
refugee camps. Despite the incalculable human and material costs, the occupation of
Lebanon, like that of Palestine, has deprived the world&#146;s paramount ethnic State of
peace and security. Given its historic origins in the belly of European colonialism, the
Zionist project and its genocidal consequences must, therefore, serve as a grim warning
why Serbian chauvinism must not be allowed to create another Palestine in the heartland of
Europe. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Oppression breeds resistance</b></u><br>
To begin with, the Palestinian encounter with Zionism underscores an undeniable truth
about tyranny: no matter how brutal or criminal its methods, political terror and
repression can never silence the will of a people determined to preserve their dignity,
honour and freedom. Thus, after 100 years of military, political, economic and social
onslaught, the Zionist enterprise has yet to devise a formula powerful enough to
extinguish the flame of Palestinian resistance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This outcome will almost certainly repeat itself in Kosovo if a
comprehensive solution is not found to the conflict there. Surely contemporary history has
not known a more despicable form of terror than the forceful &#147;transfer&#148; or
ethnic cleansing of a people from their land. Their uprooting, separation and eviction
from the places which symbolize their identity and national existence all bear the
hallmark of a kind of terrorism that cannot be equaled by any violence or torture. Any
attempt, therefore, to force the Kosovars to accept less than their full political rights
will meet with the same response that was witnessed in the case of the Palestinians. As
the latter did not melt into their places of refuge or become appeased with the
&#147;humanitarian&#148; assistance of the United Nations, so too the Kosovars will
continue to reject every partial settlement, even if initially superimposed by threats and
force.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When questioned about the correctness of protecting the Muslim Albanians,
Western leaders have always been careful to point out, and perhaps rightly so, that the
issue is not simply a matter of religion but, moreover, one of undue human suffering. This
combined sense of guilt and responsibility is, altogether, well understood because since
1987 no effective measures were taken to prevent Milosevic from redrawing the demographic
map of the Balkans. Clearly, the signs did begin to appear on the wall when he revoked
Kosovo&#146;s self-ruling status in 1987 and outlawed the Albanian language as a medium of
teaching at Pristina University&#151;a decree that resulted in the closure of the
university from that time until today. Thus, the present searches, beatings and seizures
of Albanian identity papers and money at Serbian check-points are actually the latter
stages of a deliberate policy that began long ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With regard to the Palestinians, the systematic and prolonged denial of
their national rights has, similarly, undermined all efforts at securing peace in their
region. For more than 50 years, the free and democratic world has watched passively at
their brutal expulsion and dispersal to the distant corners of the globe. The destruction
of their homes and agricultural infrastructure has gone hand-in-hand with the building of
settlements for foreign immigrants. In these settlements, Jews from Russia,
Argentina&#151;everywhere&#151;are instantly provided with electric-wired housing and
irrigated land while the Palestinians in the neighbouring camps cannot even find water to
drink. With more than 2,000 Palestinian homes still listed for demolition, the Director of
the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, Jeff Halper, acknowledged that the word
&#147;cleansing&#148; has now become an integral part of official Israeli terminology.<sup>2</sup>
Hence, in order to show how committed they are to peace, the Israelis have since Oslo
destroyed 300,000 Palestinian olive and fruit trees! Significantly, the distress caused by
these policies, especially in the area between Ramallah and Nablus&#151;the nerve centre
of the West Bank&#151;has not produced an exodus of Palestinians as the Israelis hoped.
Quite to the contrary, it has stiffened their resolve and turned the territories into a
veritable time-bomb waiting to explode.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Racism is no substitute for democracy</b></u><br>
As the attention of the world community remains firmly focused on events in the Balkans,
Israel&#146;s extremist authorities have intensified their own campaign to complete the
ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem&#151;a city which both the United Nations and the European
Union regard as illegally occupied. There, the arbitrary confiscation of Palestinian
identification papers, destruction of their homes and refusal to grant them building or
repair licenses are all akin to the Fascist policies pursued by the Belgrade regime in
Kosovo. Still, few lessons have been learned from recent history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the crude passions of nationalism erupted in Europe in the late
nineteenth century, Western leaders took no significant initiatives to reassure or
integrate their Jewish populations into their societies as equals. They sought instead to
exploit the weakness and decline of the Ottoman Empire by encouraging the Jews to
&#147;return&#148; to the &#147;Promised Land&#148; (Palestine) under the pretext that
they were &#147;God&#146;s chosen people&#148;. The partition of Palestine, eviction of
half its population, and the creation of a Jewish State on its soil has left the region in
a state of permanent turmoil.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Belgrade&#146;s current attempt to readjust the balance of forces in the
Balkans along ethnic lines will, inevitably, have similar disastrous consequences for
Europe. As in the case of Palestine, many misleading voices are calling for an ethnic
partition of Kosovo. Like the Zionist colonial-settlers who could not see beyond the
occupation of Palestinian land, Serbian extremists are also clamouring for a partition
that would leave them with the mineral deposits of northern Kosovo and its western areas
along with its historic churches. In that case, they would naturally find it much easier
to resettle the Serbs from Croatia&#146;s Krajina region, who were displaced by the
fighting during the early 1990s. History has nevertheless confirmed that the ethnic
cleansing of Palestine did not bring security to the Zionists. Hence, their stockpiles of
unconventional weapons and refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty banning the
manufacture of nuclear weapons. While Belgrade may find it difficult to reactivate and
develop its nuclear programme, it may nevertheless find it easier to acquire an arsenal of
unconventional weapons for its killing-machine.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An end to human suffering</b></u><br>
In the build-up to the present crisis, it appears that Slobodan Milosevic had committed a
fatal error of judgment. He misread the political and military resolve of NATO&#146;s
leaders to stop him in his tracks. Nothing of the sort was enforced in Palestine to
protect human lives and uphold international legitimacy. In fact, Israeli intransigence
and deviance was always encouraged by the conviction that America will not confront them,
no matter how inhuman or illegal their policies toward the Palestinians might be. A rare
example of disapproval, however, occurred in 1956 after Israel occupied the Sinai and Gaza
Strip during the trilateral attack on Egypt. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When President Eisenhower ordered the Israelis to withdraw unconditionally
from the occupied territories, Prime Minister Ben Gurion told the Knesset (on 7 November
1956) that the historical Sinai was an indivisible part of Israel. His was a response that
would have fitted perfectly with the belligerent rhetoric which the Israelis broadcast
today concerning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Indeed, he ordered a partial withdrawal
from Sinai and kept the remainder of his forces in Gaza and Sharm al-Shaykh. Eisenhower
was, however, having none of it; hence when he issued his ultimatum on American national
television, the Israelis packed up and withdrew all their forces within the first two
weeks of March 1957! Is there not a lesson here for the authors of Oslo, Cairo, Taba and
Wye?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Albanian population of Kosovo, like the Palestinian Arabs, will never
accept a settlement of their problem that denies their national rights and aspirations. On
the other extreme, Milosevic, like his Israeli admirers, will continue to resist the
return of the Albanian population to Kosovo. Dispossessed of their heritage, robbed of
their dignity and scattered across Europe, they now face a dark future of unemployment,
poverty and disease in their overcrowded refugee camps. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For all its worth, none of the exiled Albanians will be deluded by
Israel&#146;s offer to grant them refuge in occupied Palestine. Having tasted the bitter
fruits of ethnic cleansing and forced expulsion, they know all too well that these offers
are mere cosmetic gestures designed to cover-up one of the greatest evils of the twentieth
century&#151;the dispossession and expulsion of the Palestinians. If Israel is sincere in
its desire to end human suffering in Europe it must first allow the displaced Palestinians
to exercise their legitimate right of return. As their struggle had often united and
divided the Arabs in the past, so too the Kosovo problem has every potential of uniting or
dividing the Europeans for many years to come. If the painful consequences of division are
to be avoided, Kosovo must not become &#147;a land without a people&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">(1-2)</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Foreword</u></b><br>
It is anathema to speak now about the possibilities of coexistence between Islam and
Zionism. In other words, it is premature to talk about the convergence of opposites and
the conversion of swords into ploughshares when forces of revulsion and compulsion turn
into forces for proclivity<b> </b>and affinity. Historically, Islam has accommodated
Judaism as a religion and Jews as a people. But Zionism as a racial movement has dwelled
on denying the &#147;others&#148; their rights and lands. Zionism has made it very hard to
tolerate and accept a Jewish presence that springs from racism and exclusivism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The colonialist face of contemporary Judaism gained its features in the
womb of Zionist racism. This has broadened an already unbridgeable cleavage,<b> </b>making
it more difficult to entertain the idea of coexistence or even dialogue. This will
probably remain the scenario as long as the Zionist movement remains the locomotive of the
current religious and political expressions of the State of Israel. It may be unthinkable
and unimaginable today to expect an encounter between both sides to discuss a coexistence
between Islam on one side and Judeo-Zionism on the other side. The fact of the matter is
Israel continues to antagonize the Arab and the Islamic worlds. Israel goes from one
strategy of aggression to the next. It issues countless policies of discrimination and
repression against the Palestinians without any qualms. Jewish settlers cannot seem to
satiate their appetite for more Palestinian land. Jewish politicians in Israel and the
West arrogantly state that Jerusalem is the Hebrew State&#146;s eternal and indivisible
capital. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">International parties, well known for their open channels with the Zionist
movement, have come up with interfaith forums to try to facilitate a <i>rapprochement </i>with
the Islamists. The object is to bring down the resistance barriers in the Arab and Islamic
world. Zionist contingents within Western political and religious institutions put these
types of activities into high gear. But in the end, none of this seems to have produced
anything tangible. In a short time, the participants begin to discover the underlying
causes and objectives of such forums, which is the acceptance of Israel and the
normalization of relations with it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">True, peoples and nations are living a relative calm that followed the
collapse of the bi-polar world and the hostilities of the cold war. But the thought of an
Islamic-Zionist life of peace, the thought itself in such circumstances, is asphyxiating.
The idea itself violates established facts and trespasses red lines. Such an idea is
enough to classify anyone on any side as an enemy and to discredit anything else he or she
may say. This idea is paralysis, period. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Due to the sensitivity of this subject, the whole issue has to be defined
and clarified within the reason and need concerning such an issue for discussion.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Targeting Islamic Activism</b></u><br>
There are more than a few reasons for taking aim at Islamic activism. We may sum them up
in four points. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. To give a bad image to armed resistance that defies Israeli occupation</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic movement in general, but the Palestinian and Lebanese sectors
in particular, have come under malicious assault by the media. Pulling the strings of this
media campaign are well-established Zionist and Jewish figures in the West. The
Zionist-inspired crusade aims at defaming the scene of those who are legitimately
struggling and resisting Israeli occupation. This is done by trying to incriminate the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Hizbullah as they target Israeli military and
para-military objectives. Media mouthpieces of the Israeli persuasion pick up on the
injuries or deaths of some civilians in the crossfire as an excuse to fuel its drive. Then
the picture is developed in the lexicon laboratory of these media outlets to make the
Islamic resistance movement appear as if it is part and parcel of international terrorism!
The script reads something like this: These operations of armed resistance are
&#147;extremist&#148; acts working to destroy the peace process and to foster instability
in the Middle East. Embedded in this campaign are those voices that, from time to time,
call on the international and local authorities to consider all sorts of armed resistance
as a &#147;crime.&#148; This comes at a time when, in the post cold-war era, people are
enjoying their right to speak out against oppression and press on with their demands for
rights through international institutions and organizations. Now, people who had support
for resisting occupation during the cold-war years should make-do with considering their
causes obsolete and should settle in and accept occupation and tyranny. Any such
&#147;resistance movements&#148; should consider from now on any activity to be a form of
violence or terrorism that has no sponsor to protect it or offer it cover, and hence has
no legitimacy. This &#147;logic&#148; also extends to include any and all States that dare
to offer backing or lend support to such resistance movements. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Circumventing the Islamic plan</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionist forces with all their means and methods are keen on ejecting Islam
out of this conflict. They say that the issue to begin with is political and not
religious. That is why we find these campaign managers doing whatever they can to see to
it that Islamic revolutionary thought is plucked out of its institutions. They are trying
hard to domesticate the Islamic movement. They work at all levels to cut off Palestine
from its religious dimension. Then they turn around and try to condition the public mind
to accept the Israeli settler presence in Palestine with all the supremacy arrogance that
goes with it. It is at this stage that we begin to realize how the current war against the
Islamic movement in most of the Arab and Islamic countries falls into place. This war
takes on many forms: ranging from the persecution of the Islamic movement&#146;s leaders
through a witch-hunt for Islamists in universities, labour unions, missionary
institutions, and humanitarian organizations. The goal is to marginalize the gains and
progress made throughout the years and to block future success which is capable of
bringing in exponential growth for the general Islamic trend in the form of upper
political mobility. Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey and Malaysia are case examples of
this. Israel sees the Islamic movement as its mortal threat. For this reason it wants the
Islamic factor out of this engagement equation. To this end, Israel is trying to pull in
international powers&#151;especially the U.S.&#151;to its side, or if it can, Israel would
like to have the U.S. doing the fighting for it. The past five years seem to indicate that
Israel has been successful in dragging the U.S. into the fray. Israel has set up the U.S.
as a party in its conflict with the Islamic movement. The massive efforts and the
wide-ranging potentials deployed by the U.S. to down-size the Islamic resistance
phenomenon has been partially successful. Washington&#146;s carrot-and-stick policy with
Arab and Islamic&#151;even European&#151;countries has been relatively fruitful in
garnering support for its schemes that seek to bolt down the spirit that resists the
Zionist project. Owing to this U.S. master-plan, the Islamic movement has been derailed
into local and regional problems with its immediate nation-State apparatus. In other
words, the Islamic movement now has to tend to immediate problems with its local
government. This has refocused the Islamic movement and depleted much of its energy away
from concentrating on the central issue: Zionist Israel.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Shrinking and containing the conflict</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel created a lot of mileage out of the nationalist and Islamist
incompatibilities during the 1950s and 1960s that resulted in excluding Islam from a true
fight with Israel. The disaster of 1967 came as a jolt. The Arab street became agitated.
The drifting Arab began to regain his historical memory. His newly acquired consciousness
was telling him what has to be done. People began to reconsider their Islam as the way out
of this dilemma <i>en masse</i>. Islam had become in the Arab and Muslim public mind the
answer at times of stress and setback. The people finally said their words: the only way
to exit the humiliating catastrophe they were in is by adopting the Islamic system
represented by the towering figures of Islam and their contemporaries who stand for a
struggle until the Islamic conclusion of the affair. Spontaneous calls of &#147;Islam is
the solution&#148; became the popular endorsement of the Islamic programme for change in
the Arab countries for better political, social, economic and patriotic conditions until
the level of Islamic civilization is a fact of life now as it was then throughout Islamic
history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamic forces were in part successful in mobilizing the masses against
the dangers of the Zionist enterprise. These Islamic forces stood behind armed resistance
in Palestine and Lebanon. Differences with the Nationalist currents were minimized.
Sometimes they even cooperated. The most important thing was the end of the cantankerous
relationship between both sides in years past. Now both sides agreed on pooling together
all the resources of the Arab and Islamic arenas to confront Israel as the common enemy of
the ummah (the Muslim community). With this reconciliation and mutual understanding
between the Islamist and Arab nationalist currents, and with the Islamists in the late
1980s opting for peaceful change away from armed conflict with the regimes, all this gave
more momentum to a Jehadi mobilization against the Zionist enterprise. And with the
escalating effective Islamic armed resistance strikes against Israel in Palestine and
Lebanon, Israel began to sense the mortal Islamic &#147;threat.&#148; In the aftermath of
the Persian Gulf War II, Israel began to reap the fallout of regional animosities among
the Arab governments. With noticeable American support, Israel managed to revive the
previous divisions and estrangement among fellow Arabs. The concept of mutual Arab
security was now in the winds. Now, with the level of inter-Arab animosity running high,
each Arab country had enough to worry about internally and no one had anymore time for the
Palestinians, the Palestinian issue, and the requirements for confronting Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are Jewish-Zionist brokers in the West within academic circles,
research centres, and decision-making quarters who try to market the idea that
anti-Semitism is political and not religious. In the Arab context this would mean that
anti-Semitism is strictly a national concern. Islam as a universal religion has nothing to
do with anti-Semitism we are told. And is not served by this conflict. Thus, those
attempts to stuff this issue with religious dimensions is a travesty and a distortion of
reality. And the efforts exerted by Islamic leaders in the Arab homeland to
&#147;Palestine-ize&#148; the non-Arab Islamic conscience by harping on the
&#147;Islamicity&#148; of the Palestinian issue by tying it to historical and religious
dimensions pertaining to the Aqsa Mosque and the Abrahamic Sanctuary, are tantamount to
imposing religion on a nationalist issue. Therefore, non-Arab Muslims are intruders into
this issue and may not interpret the Zionist movement the way the Arabs do. They may not
visualize the Zionist movement as a colonialist project working on usurping Muslim holy
lands and threatening the integrity and unity of the Muslim ummah! These same
spokespersons who are affiliated with the Zionist cause attempt to diminish the
Arab-Islamic struggle against Israel by reducing it to a political problem between two
opposing sides: a Palestinian and an Israeli. The solution, therefore, should be a
political solution without the interference of other parties (allies or antagonists) under
the pretext of some religious component. It is transparent that what they seek to
accomplish is the weakening of the Islamic factor and Islamic feelings about the
Palestinian issue. They want to dilute the unified response of both the Islamic and the
Arabic ummah. Once that is done, they feel confident that the global Islamic movement will
no longer play a role in this battleground affair where Zionism with its colonialist
policies is the certified enemy. After all, this Israel will appear as if it is not the
hegemonic power it is and those opposed to Israel will be in the margins.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many are those in this world who witnessed angry Palestinians,
commemorating the 51st anniversary of Al-Nakba, as a people frozen in time.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, the time for Palestinians is not as stagnate as the world may think.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Each passing year since the &#147;Palestinian Catastrophe&#148; of 1948
has ignited in them more determination and love&#151;a love that Palestine truly deserves.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is one distinct difference, however, between those who fought for
Palestine in 1948 and those who stood, a few days ago, with empty hands defending their
olive trees from the Israeli bulldozers in Sa&#146;ir and Shuikh villages in the West
Bank. For the latter, Palestine is more than a piece of land; it&#146;s all the pain and
suffering that 51 years could possibly contain.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The growing age of the struggle became an incentive rather than a
predicament. Thus the value of Palestine increases with time and becomes even more
precious.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps world attention is shifting its focus from the cause of Palestine
and the fate of the people, especially the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The signing of agreements, starting at Oslo through Wye River, gave the
world a false impression that peace has finally made it to the warring Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has cleverly succeeded in presenting itself to the world as the
only escape and refuge for victims and descendants who survived the holocaust. With that,
Israel has mastered the art of deception by waving the only card it holds to justify human
and cultural genocide against the Palestinian people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Surprisingly enough, the story of the Palestinian people survived despite
all attempts by Israel and the United States to belittle it into an insignificant issue. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that Palestinians, with limited means, have always invented ways
and methods of resistance forced their case on the world, and perhaps the
&#147;intentionally blind&#148; media.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel, involuntarily, has also contributed to the continuation of the
Palestinian struggle. No thanks to Israel, but their massacres in Deir Yasin, South
Lebanon and Hebron were an encouragement for the whole nation to create a legendary
revolution, thereafter called the Intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even though United Nations resolution 194, which calls for the Palestinian
refugees&#146; right to return, has been re-affirmed on a yearly basis since its
initiation in 1948, not even one Palestinian was ever granted that right. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every year, following their exodus, Palestinian refugees gather with their
flags and signs to chant for a land that they were thrown from at gunpoint. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Al-Burj al-Shamail refugee camp in South Lebanon, 4,000 Palestinians
took to the streets with loudspeakers and waving flags, ready to make the same promise
they have made 50 times in the past.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even with the Lebanese police rushing to stop their progress, ordering
them to disperse, the promise-keepers kept their fists held high until they were done with
their yearly ritual. As usual, the gathering ended with a final pause beside the
ever-expanding graveyard to read al-Fatiha on the souls of the camp&#146;s scores of
martyrs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Gaza, for two weeks, with their own bodies, Palestinians have been
blocking a caravan of Israeli trucks loaded with materials needed to expand new Jewish
settlements in the Gazan enclave.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And while the furious settlers were reported to give the Palestinians
obscene hand gestures and curses, the group of Palestinian demonstrators replied with,
&#147;We would rather die before giving one inch of Palestine away.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fifty-one years is a long time. It is long enough indeed to convert the
cause of Palestine into a legend, a piece of poetry or an odyssey in the hearts of its
people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fifty-one years is enough to make the struggle for Palestine something
that can neither be blown up by napalm nor uprooted by bulldozers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Israel bets its survival on the extermination of Palestine, it will
surely be disappointed. For Palestine now is an idea, a noble one indeed, and how can
Israel with all of its might eliminate that noble idea? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During this commemoration of the Palestinian catastrophe, the chants from
Palestinians echoed everywhere, and carried many similar terms and words that reflect a
shared dream carried by all refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From Gaza to Um-al-Fahm, al-Wihdat, al-Yarmouk, Ein al-Hilwah and
Al-Nusierat, calls for &#147;resistance&#148;, &#147;freedom&#148;, &#147;Intifada&#148;
and &#147; sacrifice&#148; were loudly heard. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The long arm of Zionism has truly perverted the minds of many
Western governments to forego Israel&#146;s radical and racist practices. Hitherto, this
long arm has miserably failed in preventing any Palestinian from hesitating to cry out,
&#147;Palestine is Arab&#133;Palestine is Arab.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember many years ago the debate in the United Nations over the
resolution equating Zionism with a form of Racism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel lost the debate in the UN General Assembly where ineffective and
unenforceable resolutions are approved all the time. But Israel does not take anything for
granted. It made a strong come-back many years later and applied strategic economic and
political muscle to force the United Nations to admit to its uselessness by revoking the
resolution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Missed in this debate was the essence of the effort to expose Zionism as a
political movement that hides behind the Jewish religion to vilify Arab non-Jews and to
serve as the lapdog of Israel&#146;s Western-based lobbying machines. When a U.S.
Congressman rebuffs Israeli pay-offs and cash donations and stands for principle, the ZOA
and its minions lie, distort and slander until the victim&#151;an American, mind
you&#151;is chased out of office.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And when the target happens to be a young boy of Arab American heritage
whose father is the leader of a moderate but effective Arab American lobbying
organization, you should see how the ZOA lapdogs salivate.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">ZOA President Morton Klein recently led a shameless assault on a young man
named Joseph Zogby.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You know the last name. He is the son of Jim Zogby, one of the most
effective Arab American lobbyists in Washington. Through him, American politics has
changed so dramatically that the influence of the ZOA has been reduced significantly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Klein learned last April that Zogby&#146;s son had been hired to work in
the State Department as a &#147;special assistant for the State Department&#146;s Near
East Bureau Chief.&#148; It&#146;s more of an administrative position. A junior consulting
position at best. A good place for a young American like Joseph Zogby to express himself
as an American proud of his Arab American heritage, and to offer a viewpoint that often is
lacking in American politics and that balances the cadre of anti-Arab haters that clog the
American political system like silt in a drainpipe.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Imagine when Klein sent a letter filled with slanderous lies and attacks
to the U.S. State Department demanding that young Joseph Zogby be fired. Klein was
wide-eyed and his nostrils were flaring, I am sure, when he wrote that letter, asserting
that Joseph Zogby had expressed views that Israeli security forces had tortured hundreds
of Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Wow! The story was picked up by every Arab-hater in the American news
media.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Possibly Klein was angry because he knows that Joseph Zogby had
under-represented the extent of the inhumane acts of torture that characterize the
brutality of Shin Bet, convicted repeatedly of murdering innocent Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Klein was angry because he believes that no American has the right to
criticize Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then he had the nerve to claim in a statement to the news media,
&#147;We at the ZOA support hiring anyone without regard to their ethnicity. In physics,
in surgery or Middle East policy, it is not diversity that is needed, but excellence,
integrity and objectivity.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am not sure how Mr. Klein could even use those words in his statement
since his own character lacks &#147;excellence, integrity and objectivity.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, Mr. Klein&#146;s actions speak loudly as the actions of a 1950s
racist.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You see, if Klein is not a racist, he would also have listed nearly every
American who is Jewish who works in the State Department&#146;s Near East Bureau, or
serves as an adviser on Middle East issues for the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I don&#146;t have enough space to identify every U.S. Government employee
who is Jewish who falls into the same category as Joseph Zogby, because there are many.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, according to a racist like Klein, they do not belong in the
government serving this country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And why don&#146;t we start with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who is of Jewish heritage? Or, James P. Rubin? Is he not Jewish, too?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, unlike Mr. Klein, I feel that they have a right to work in our
government. To serve THIS COUNTRY, Mr. Klein, not a foreign country that has condoned
spying against our military agencies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe that every American has the right to express his or her opinions
and to do so in a manner that assists in reaching the truth of an issue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That is what Joseph Zogby has done.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And because Mr. Klein and the ZOA so vehemently dislike Joseph
Zogby&#146;s role in the service of HIS COUNTRY, the United States, and does not demand
the same of Jewish Americans, that falls in the category of discrimination based not only
on race, but on religion, too.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The real threat to this country is not honest young Americans like Joseph
Zogby who have a right to express the facts and the truth, but rabid racist haters like
Morton Klein who has singled out Joseph Zogby not because of his views, but because Mr.
Klein finds Joseph Zogby&#146;s truths to be discomforting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Don&#146;t feel bad, young Joseph Zogby, Morton Klein also believes that
what convicted criminal and spy Jonathan Pollard did in exposing Americans to danger is
acceptable and he should be pardoned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Being called a racist by Morton Klein is like being called ugly by a pig.
Except just a little uglier.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Rules Governing the Relationship Between<br>
Islam and Christianity</font></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The basis of the relationship between Islam and Christianity springs from
texts that have proven themselves over time and that have been successful in forging
strong relations. In the Holy Qur&#146;an, God says, &#147;God forbids you not, with
regard to those who fight you not for (your) faith nor drive you out of your homes, from
dealing kindly and justly with them: for God loves those who are just. God only forbids
you, with regard to those who fight you for (your) faith and drive you out of your homes
and support (others) in driving you out, from turning to them (for friendship and
protection). It is such who turn to them (in these circumstances) that do wrong <b>(1)</b>.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is the basis of the relationship between the two parties. Long ago,
Islam created a constitution guiding relations between its followers and the followers of
other religions who agree to live under its governance. Islam gave them their full rights,
and required from them obligations that are required of any citizen in any State. Here is
a summary of the rights granted to people who agree to live in an Islamic society:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Political rights, meaning the rights of someone as part of a political
group:</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(a) <u><b>Right to employment</b></u>. I see no reason why Christians
living in a Muslim society should not be employed, especially if officials decide to give
them jobs. This is based on the justice of Islamic <i>shariah </i>(law), which strengthens
healthy practices and legislation in an Islamic society. The jobs that have to do with the
Islamic religion are limited to Muslims. Bukhari narrates as a correct saying: Abu Musa
Al-Ash&#146;ari said, &#147;Two men and I went to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and one
of the men said, &#145;Oh Prophet of God, give us responsibility for some of what God has
given you responsibility for.&#146; And the other said the same. So the Prophet, peace be
upon him, said, &#145;We do not give responsibility to those who ask it, nor those who
wish to retain it.&#146;<b>(2)</b>&#148; Such are the rules of merit and fairness of
employment in Muslim society. To reaffirm this Qur&#146;anic, humanistic principle, we
look to Islamic history, especially the era of ideal implementation of Islam. Muslims and
non-Muslims were equal in everything that had no direct link to religion. Every citizen,
regardless of creed, is allowed to attain any civil service job in the Islamic State <b>(3).</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(b) <u><b>Right to candidacy and election</b></u>. The right of nomination
to office and to vote are rights of all citizens, without discrimination. Every group can
choose its representatives for public assemblies. Each has the right to choose who
represents it in expressing its special concerns. Currently, the position of head of State
is not a religious position, so they have the right to choose the head of State just like
other citizens. This is what Dr. Abdul Karim Zeidan wrote in his excellent work, &#147;The
Rules for Christians, Jews, and Asylum-Seekers [in the Muslim State].&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(c) <u><b>Freedom of religion and thought</b></u>. God said, &#147;Let
there be no compulsion in religion <b>(4)</b>&#148;,<font SIZE="1"> </font>which is a rule
that Islam brought regarding the followers of other religions in a Muslim society. They
and their religions are left alone. Freedom of religion and thought is guaranteed for all
citizens of the State. This is also found in the Sunna of the Prophet (pbuh) in the
much-quoted saying of Najran: &#147;Najran and its court live under God and have the
protection of Muhammad, the messenger of God, for their wealth, religion, trade and every
small or large thing that they might own <b>(5)</b>.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(d) <u><b>Freedom of opinion and education</b></u>. The basis of relations
in civilized societies is respect for the other&#146;s opinion, and making education
accessible to all citizens, allowing all to reach their potential and be the best they can
be. As long as we accept Christians in the State and society they have the right to
express their positions in a civilized, constructive way. They also have a right to
education and teaching, and even in explaining their religion under the Qur&#146;anic
rule: &#147;Dispute not with the People of the Book, except with means better (than mere
disputation) <b>(6).</b>&#148; Debate and discussion on religious affairs is allowed <b>(7).</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(e) <u><b>Right to access public facilities</b></u>. The Prophet (pbuh)
said, &#147;People are partners in water, food, and fire <b>(8)</b>.&#148; People is a
general term that includes every member of society, Muslim or non-Muslim. So everyone
enjoys public utilities fairly. They also have the right to what is called today
&#147;social security&#148;, which is known in Islam as &#147;guaranteeship in the
Treasury&#148;. The Prophet (pbuh) said, &#147;Each of you is a shepherd and each of you
is responsible for his flock <b>(9)</b>.&#148;<font SIZE="1"> </font>This awesome system
of social care in Muslim society is an anchor of Islamic <i>shariah </i>(law)<i>. </i>An
example of how it works is found in <i>The Book of Money</i>,<i> </i>by Abu Obeid. He
narrates how the well-known Umayyad Caliph, Omar ibn Abdul Aziz, wrote to his
representative in Basra, Uday ibn Arta: &#147;There is one from the Protected People
(dhimma) who has aged, weakened, and lost his income, so give him enough from the Muslim
Treasury to better him.&#148; The State is obligated to tend to its citizens without
discrimination or favouritism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">(f) <u><b>Financial rights</b></u>. All citizens have guaranteed financial
rights, and they have the right to practice those rights according to the law. Non-Muslims
and Muslims have the right to enjoy trade and ownership, and Muslim scholars have found
that conducting business with Protected People is allowed, even though they allow the sale
of alcohol and pork. Their money is protected just as the Muslims&#146; money is protected
<b>(10).</b><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obligations</b><br>
The social relationship is a complementary one for all citizens in a State. The State
gives them what they want and need, the law guarantees their public and private rights,
and the individuals are asked to help improve society. Those who demand and receive rights
must in turn perform certain duties. Rashid Ghanouchi says in his book, <i>Rights of
Citizenship, </i>that &#147;the Islamic State is a universal one. Every human in it enjoys
the justice of Islam regardless of creed. Everyone has the right to citizenship as long as
he or she obeys its premises. So citizenry is about rights and obligations <b>(11).</b>&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After presenting citizens&#146; rights in general, we shall discuss
obligations, starting with the financial ones: <i>jizya, kharaj </i>and <i>ushoor.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is much confusion on this subject, because on the surface it seems
like discrimination, oppression, humiliation and an indirect form of compulsion to require
non-Muslims to pay the <i>jizya</i> tax <b>(12).</b> To be fair and clear, to build a
healthy relationship in a civil society, <i>jizya </i>is a head tax taken from free,
adult, working and able men. It is not assessed on women, children, the mentally disabled
or those who live a life of worship. It is taken from non-Muslims in a Muslim State to
guarantee State protection, support State services, and defend the State. Defense of the
State is an obligation of every citizen. Ghanouchi goes farther to say, &#147;Part of the <i>jizya
</i>tax is that these non-Muslim citizens, if they agree to work in the defense of the
homeland, do not have to pay <i>jizya </i>anymore. The history of Islamic conquest in
reputable history books holds many examples where Protected People have preferred to
perform military duties <b>(13).</b>&#148;</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jizya </i>is not a punishment for not converting to Islam, as some people
argue. It is not a form of humiliation to force one to become a Muslim, for this would
contradict the Islamic provisions for freedom of thought and religion. The writings of the
scholar, Hussein Fadlallah, are impressive. In a study he did for the Strategic Studies
and Documentation Centre in Beirut entitled, &#147;Islamic-Christian Relations: A Reading
into the Present and the Future&#148;, he writes: &#147;What is meant by (Jizya) is a tax
that they pay in return for State protection of their property, selves, reputations, and
religion without being forced to go to war or pay zakat (as Muslims do). They actually
have a better tax situation than the Muslims, without any part of their humanity being
taken away <b>(14)</b>.&#148; He also writes, &#147;Some people talk about rejecting this
special status, because it gives the impression of a lesser status of citizenship. In
these cases, Islam does not prohibit them from voluntary payment of Islamic taxes and
working in jihad in the framework of State defense&#151;the new tax would not be an issue
in these cases <b>(15).</b>&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Concept of dhimma (protection) in the term &#147;Protected
People&#148; raises the ire of many Christians, who see it as humiliating. It has been the
subject of attack by many people with ulterior motives. But the principle of Islamic <i>shariah
</i>is non-discrimination among people, regardless of color, gender, language, or
geographic origin. Only one thing makes people different: how close or far they are from
God and how much they believe in the heavenly message. The message of Islam is a universal
one for all peoples in all times and places.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dividing humans on the basis of Islam is, in the view of <i>shariah, </i>a
very important differentiation that defines the relationship between individuals in an
Islamic society, individuals who might be Muslims or otherwise. It also defines the
relationship between the Islamic polity and others, which is known today as international
relations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So what does dhimma mean? And who are dhimma people? What are its
principles?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dhimma in Arabic means &#147;safety under covenant <b>(16)</b>.&#148; In
this context, it means the covenant given by the Muslim governor to the People of the
Book. Under this agreement, they become citizens in the Islamic polity. They have full
rights and obey its laws. The Prophet (pbuh) said, &#147;The Muslims have one protection
(dhimma) and the lowest among them respects it <b>(17)</b>.&#148; Scholars regard the
dhimma covenant to be an acknowledgement that the People of the Book will retain their
religion and live in a Muslim society under their own religious laws in return for
protection, security <i>jizya, </i>and obeying the general laws of society. Today, this is
known as the &#147;naturalization&#148; process that some people go through to become
citizens of other States. The only one who can grant it in an Islamic polity is the
governor or Muslim ruler, and this is further proof of its importance as a concept.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Muslim&#146;s relations with others is not based on canceling the role
of the other. Relationships are built on cooperation, respect and appreciation. We must
build, not destroy. The greater Islamic programme is capable of providing a safe civil
society in Palestine and elsewhere. Islamic-Christian relations in the future Palestine
will be civilized if both sides understand each other equally, if real education is
provided to both sides, and if we realize that citizenship in an Islamic polity is a right
that is enjoyed by all individuals who accept the law and constitution that govern the
Muslim community. The principle of equality in Muslim governance is fixed: there is no
room for distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims except where religious differences
govern it.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"> Israel Shahak</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Desecrating the Sabbath to Save Life</i></b><br>
In connection with cases that do actually involve desecration of the sabbath. Hatam Sofer-
like other authorities- makes a distinction between two categories of work banned on the
sabbath. First, there is work banned by the Torah, the biblical text (as interpreted by
the Talmud); such work may only be performed in very exceptional cases, if failing to do
so would cause an <i>extreme </i>danger of hostility towards Jews. Then there are types of
work which are only banned by the sages who extended the original law of the Torah; the
attitude towards breaking such bans is generally more lenient.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another <i>responsum</i> of Hatam Sofer<sup> </sup>deals with the question
whether it is permissible for a Jewish doctor to travel by carriage on the sabbath in
order to heal a Gentile. After pointing out that under certain conditions travelling by
horse-drawn carriage on the sabbath only violates a ban imposed 'by the sages' rather than
by the Torah, he goes on to recall Maimonides' pronouncement that Gentile women in labour
must not be helped on the sabbath, even if no desecration of the sabbath is involved, and
states that the same principle applies to all medical practice, not just midwifery. But he
then voices the fear that if this were put into practice, 'it would arouse undesirable
hostility,' for 'the Gentiles would not accept the excuse of sabbath observance,' and
'would say that the blood of an idolater has little worth in our eyes'. Also, perhaps more
importantly. Gentile doctors might take revenge on their Jewish patients. Better excuses
must be found. He advises a Jewish doctor who is called to treat a Gentile patient out of
town on the sabbath to excuse himself by saying that he is required to stay in town in
order to look after his other patients, 'for he can use this in order to say, &quot;I
cannot move because of the danger to this or that patient, who needs a doctor first, and I
may not desert my charge&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the whole discussion, the main issue is the excuses that should be
made, not the actual healing or the welfare of the patient. And throughout it is taken for
granted that it is all right to deceive Gentiles rather than treat them, so long as
'hostility' can be averted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, in modern times most Jewish doctors are not religious and do
not even know of these rules. Moreover, it appears that even many who are religious
prefer- to their credit- to abide by the Hippocratic oath rather than by the precepts of
their fanatic rabbis.<sup> </sup>However, the rabbis' guidance cannot fail to have some
influence on some doctors; and there are certainly many who, while not actually following
that guidance, choose not to protest against it publicly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All this is far from being a dead issue. The most up-to-date halakhic
position on these matters is contained in a recent concise and authoritative book
published in English under the title <i>Jewish Medical Law.<sup> </sup></i>This book,
which bears the imprint of the prestigious Israeli foundation <i>Mossad Harav Kook, </i>is
based on the <i>responsa </i>of R. Eli'ezer Yehuda Waldenberg, Chief Justice of the
Rabbinical District Court of Jerusalem. A few passages of this work deserve special
mention.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, 'it is forbidden to desecrate the sabbath ... for a Karaite.' This
is stated bluntly, absolutely and without any further qualification. Presumably the
hostility of this small sect makes no difference, so they should be allowed to die rather
than be treated on the sabbath.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for Gentiles: 'According to the ruling stated in the Talmud and Codes
of Jewish Law, it is forbidden to desecrate the Sabbath - whether violating Biblical or
rabbinical law - in order to save the life of a dangerously ill gentile patient. It is
also forbidden to deliver the baby of a gentile woman on the Sabbath.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this is qualified by a dispensation: 'However, today it is permitted
to desecrate the Sabbath on behalf of a Gentile by performing actions prohibited by
rabbinical law, for by so doing one prevents ill feelings from arising between Jew and
Gentile.'</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This does not go very far, because medical treatment very often involves
acts banned on the sabbath by the Torah itself, which are not covered by this
dispensation. There are, we are told, 'some' halakhic authorities who extend the
dispensation to such acts as well - but this is just another way of saying that <i>most </i>halakhic
authorities, and the ones that really count, take the opposite view. However, all is not
lost. <i>Jewish Medical Law </i>has a truly breathtaking solution to this difficulty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The solution hangs upon a nice point of talmudic law. A ban imposed by the
Torah on performing a given act on the sabbath is presumed to apply only when the primary
intention in performing it is the actual outcome of the act. (For example, grinding wheat
is presumed to be banned by the Torah only if the purpose is actually to obtain flour.) On
the other hand. if the performance of the same act is merely incidental to some other
purpose (<i>melakhah</i> <i>seh'eynah tzrikhah</i> <i>legufah) </i>then the act changes
its status - it is still forbidden, to be sure, but only by the sages rather than by the
Torah itself. Therefore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In order to avoid any transgression of the law, there is a legally
  acceptable method of rendering treatment on behalf of a gentile patient even when dealing
  with violation of Biblical Law. <i>It is suggested that at the time that the physician is
  providing the necessary care, his intentions should not primarily be to cure the patient,
  but to protect himself and the Jewish people from accusations of religious discrimination
  and severe retaliation that may endanger him in particular and the Jewish people in
  general. </i>With this intention, any act on the physician's part becomes 'an act whose
  actual outcome is not its primary purpose' ... which is forbidden on Sabbath only by
  rabbinical law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This hypocritical substitute for the Hippocratic oath is also proposed by
a recent authoritative Hebrew book.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the facts were mentioned at least twice in the Israeli press,<sup>
</sup>the Israeli Medical Association has remained silent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having treated in some detail the supremely important subject of the
attitude of the Halakhah to a Gentile's very life, we shall deal much more briefly with
other halakhic rules which discriminate against Gentiles. Since the number of such rules
is very large, we shall mention only the more important ones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><i><b>Sexual Offenccs</b></i><br>
Sexual intercourse between a married Jewish woman and any man other than her husband is a
capital offence for both parties, and one of the three most heinous sins. The status of
Gentile women is very different. The Halakhah presumes all Gentiles to be utterly
promiscuous and the verse 'whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue [of
semen] is like the issue of horses<sup>40</sup> is applied to them. Whether a Gentile
woman is married or not makes no difference, since as far as Jews are concerned the very
concept of matrimony does not apply to Gentiles ('There is no matrimony for a heathen').
Therefore, the concept of adultery also does not apply to intercourse between a Jewish man
and a Gentile woman; rather, the Talmud<sup> </sup>equates such intercourse to the sin of
bestiality. (For the same reason, Gentiles are generally presumed not to have certain
paternity.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the <i>Talmudic Encyclopedia:<sup> </sup></i>'He who has
carnal knowledge of the wife of a Gentile is not liable to the death penalty, for it is
written: &quot;thy fellow's wife&quot;<sup> </sup>rather than the alien's wife; and even
the precept that a man &quot;shall cleave unto his wife&quot;<sup> </sup>which is
addressed to the Gentiles does not apply to a Jew. just there is no matrimony for a
heathen; and although a married Gentile woman is forbidden to the Gentiles, in any case a
Jew is exempted.'</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This does not imply that sexual intercourse between a Jewish man and a
Gentile woman is permitted- quite the contrary. But the main punishment is inflicted on
the Gentile woman; she must be executed, even if she was raped by the Jew: 'If a Jew has
coitus with a Gentile woman, whether she be a child of three or an adult, whether married
or unmarried, and even if he is a minor aged only nine years and one day- because he had
willful coitus with her, she must be killed, as is the case with a beast, because through
her a Jew got into trouble.<sup> </sup>The Jew, however, must be flogged, and if he is a
Kohen (member of the priestly tribe) he must receive double the number of lashes, because
he has committed a double offence: a Kohen must not have intercourse with a prostitute,
and all Gentile women are presumed to be prostitutes. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Money and Property</b></i><br>
1 <i>Gifts. </i>The Talmud bluntly forbids giving a gift to a Gentile. However, classical
rabbinical authorities bent this rule because it is customary among businessmen to give
gifts to business contacts. It was therefore laid down that a Jew may give a gift to a
Gentile <i>acquaintance, </i>since this is regarded not as a true gift but as a sort of
investment, for which some return is expected. Gifts to 'unfamiliar Gentiles' remain
forbidden. A broadly similar rule applies to almsgiving. Giving alms to a Jewish beggar is
an important religious duty. Alms to Gentile beggars are merely permitted for the sake of
peace. However there are numerous rabbinical warnings against allowing the Gentile poor to
become 'accustomed' to receiving alms from Jews, so that it should be possible to withhold
such alms without arousing undue hostility.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2 <i>Taking of interest. </i>Anti-Gentile discrimination in this matter
has become largely theoretical, in view of the dispensation which in effect allows
interest to be exacted even from a Jewish borrower. However, it is still the case that
granting an interest-free loan to a Jew is recommended as an act of charity, but from a
Gentile borrower it is mandatory to exact interest. In fact, many - though not all-
rabbinical authorities, including Maimonides, consider it mandatory to exact as much usury
as possible on a loan to a Gentile.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3 Lost property. </i>If a Jew finds property whose probable owner is
Jewish, the finder is strictly enjoined to make a positive effort to return his find by
advertising it publicly. In contrast, the Talmud and all the early rabbinical authorities
not only allow a Jewish finder to appropriate an article lost by a Gentile, but actually
forbid him or her to return it. In more recent times, when laws were passed in most
countries making it mandatory to return lost articles, the rabbinical authorities
instructed Jews to do what these laws say, as an act of civil obedience to the state - but
not as a religious duty, that is without making a positive effort to discover the owner if
it is not probable that he is Jewish.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4 Deception in business. </i>It is a grave sin to practice any kind of
deception whatsoever against a Jew. Against a Gentile it is only forbidden to practice
direct deception. Indirect deception is allowed, unless it is likely to cause hostility
towards Jews or insult to the Jewish religion. The paradigmatic example is mistaken
calculation of the price during purchase. If a Jew makes a mistake unfavourable to
himself, it is one's religious duty to correct him. If a Gentile is spotted making such a
mistake, one need not let him know about it, but say 'I rely on your calculation', so as
to forestall his hostility in case he subsequently discovers his own mistake.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">5 Fraud. </i>It is forbidden to defraud a Jew by selling or buying at an
unreasonable price. However, 'Fraud does not apply to Gentiles, or it is written: &quot;Do
not defraud each man his brother&quot;; but a Gentile who defrauds a Jew should be
compelled to make good the fraud, but should not be punished more severely than a Jew [in
a similar case].'</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">6 Theft and robbery. </i>Stealing (without violence) is absolutely
forbidden - as the <i>Shulhan 'Arukh </i>so nicely puts it: 'even from a Gentile'. Robbery
(with violence) is strictly forbidden if the victim is Jewish. However, robbery of a
Gentile by a Jew is not forbidden outright but only under certain circumstances such as
'when the Gentiles are not under our rule', but is permitted 'when they are under our
rule'. Rabbinical authorities differ among themselves as to the precise details of the
circumstances under which a Jew may rob a Gentile, but the whole debate is concerned only
with the relative power of Jews and Gentiles rather than with universal considerations of
justice and humanity. This may explain why so very few rabbis have protested against the
robbery of Palestinian property in Israel: it was backed by overwhelming Jewish power.</p>

Within Islam:<br>
Secularism Versus Islamism-The Case Of Algeria</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></font><font SIZE="3">Prof. John P. Entelis*</b></p>
</font></i><b>

<p ALIGN="center">Introduction</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The debate about conflict within the Islamic world between sectarianism
and secularism has been framed in civilizational and cultural terms. Yet, in my view, the
Algerian experience clearly demonstrates that the real source of conflict lies in
questions of political economy and the way in which power, privilege, and prestige are
monopolized and manipulated by the few at the expense of the many. To be sure, ever since
the Iranian revolution, the political economy dimension has been subordinated to
civilizational, cultural, and religious concerns. Yet, by their very nature, the latter
are infinitely more difficult to resolve or even to correctly conceptualize than are
problems of political economy</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Added to the conceptual problem lies the question of political context
within which debates about such issues can take place. In democratic and democratizing
societies, free and open debate is permitted, which allows a full airing of differences
and perspectives. In Algeria and throughout much of the Arab Middle East and North Africa,
however, little opportunity exists for a free and fair exchange of ideas about
civilizational or political questions. One result is that virtually all of the exchanges
taking place on these issues are occurring outside the region by observers and not
participants. Even in the limited instances where contested debates take place, they
operate in highly constrained and controlled political environments. It is no surprise,
therefore, that those most affected by the outcome of intra-civilizational debates are the
ones least permitted to articulate their views. Thus, to argue, that questions of
democracy and elections must be addressed <i>after </i>the civilizational question has
been resolved amounts to putting the cart before the horse. The reality in the
Arab-Islamic world as elsewhere is that issues of secularism and sectarianism can be
approached, debated, resolved, and synthesized only in a politically democratic framework
if they are to endure and be truly representative and comprehensive. Thus, democracy
first, debate about cultural policy later.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another preliminary point concerns the question of the international
dimension of the so-called civilizational question. By this I mean the dominant role
played by external actors in attempting to influence the debate. The very framing of the
issue in terms of secularism-religion betrays a Western bias and preference for certain
cultural outcomes and a denial of competing interpretations that could constitute valid
alternative paradigms for non-Western societies and polities.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center">The Algerian Case</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What people often describe as a conflict between &quot;Muslim
fundamentalists&quot; and &quot;secularists&quot; in Algeria is really at heart a conflict
of political economy and power, a struggle over who gets, what, when, and how.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A false dichotomy has defined Algeria in the period since the outbreak of
nation-wide riots in October 1988, which, in their aftermath, saw the rise of a populist
Islamist movement bent on challenging the long-entrenched power of a military-led
authoritarian political order. Indeed, authoritarianism's deep-rootedness is at the heart
of Algeria's current conflict, not Algeria's cultural, civilizational or religious
identity. Even before French colonialism in 1830, Algerian society was characterized by a
multiplicity of regional, cultural, and ethnic orientations. Yet, none of these
sociological cleavages or differences overrode the dominating influence of Islam as
religion, culture, and identity. To this day and contrary to certain Western opinion,<sub>
</sub>Algeria remains a unified country integrated within a powerful sense of
Algerian-ness which has Islam at its core. It is also a cautious and conservative society
notwithstanding its revolutionary pretensions. To be sure, society has evolved into a
complex network of class differences and bureaucratic types which make Algeria difficult
to characterize in any simple way. Yet,<i> </i>out of this mass modernization has emerged
over the years a relatively small stratum of privileged elite mostly of French persuasion,
who have come to monopolize state power and society's resources, including its access to
education, travel, and the media. As such, this unrepresentative elite, supported by the
army officer class of which it is an integral part, has sought to portray the current
conflict in Algeria as one between &quot;secularists&quot; defending modernist interests
fighting against &#147;obscurantist&#148; Islamists. Nothing could be further from the
truth. The reality of course, is much more complex, yet one fact stands out the way in
which Algeria's political economy has been completely &quot;high-jacked&quot; by the
Francophone elite, who now seek to explain the inevitable catastrophe such a highjacking
has created in terms of a cultural or civilizational clash.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center">Islam And Governance</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To illustrate the above point that the Algerian crisis is the result of a
mismanaged political economy including a systematic degradation of Islamic culture, let us
retrace the role of the Islamic Salvation Front or the FIS in Algeria&#146;s experience
with democracy, however brief.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In its more moderate and accommodationist form, political Islam as
represented by the FIS was essentially an expression of popular discontent with existing
political economy arrangements, including cultural policy. In its essence, the FIS was and
remains as &quot;secular&quot; and as religious as any other party contesting political
power, save that it was the most popular by a very wide margin. This appeal was first
demonstrated in the June, 1990, local and regional elections, which the FIS overwhelmingly
won, gaining the votes of an incredible cross-section of Algerian society, including its
youth, middle class, and Westernized women, among others. Once permitted to govern<i>, </i>the
FIS proved unexceptional in its performance. In some instances, the Islamist party was
inefficient<i> </i>and inept while in others it was responsible and effective.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In<i> </i>the national parliamentary elections of December, 1991, the FIS<i>
</i>again demonstrated its broad appeal among the<i> </i>Algerian people. Yet, this<i> </i>appeal
had less to do with FIS&#146;s ideology, which remained purposively vague and ambiguous
especially on issues of economic policy, but more with its practical performance on the
ground where it could be evaluated based not on what it promised but on what it had
accomplished. Obviously, for a great many Algerians, FIS deserved continued support based
on its public policy performance. In other words, it was not a question of Islamism versus
secularism that animated the Algerian electorate but rather such issues as political
honesty, integrity and accountability economic performance, cultural coherence, and
overall standards of governance. In this regard, both &quot;secularists&quot; and
&quot;sectarians&quot; supported the FIS.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those who most suffered from such policies were the privileged elite who
could not envision a new social order in which democracy, justice, economic development,
and cultural integrity would now be available to all Algerians! It was no surprise,
therefore, that the praetorian guard protecting this class put an immediate and abrupt
halt to the democratization process, justifying its actions in the name of
&quot;saving&quot; democracy, secularism, and modernity. No one was fooled, however. Yet
unlike the situations elsewhere in which the anti-democratic actions of military juntas
would arouse the wrath and disdain of the world's leading democracies, there was virtually
no criticism from overseas regarding the Algerian coup d'etat. Clearly the country's
geostrategic importance, the role of Algerian oil and gas in the world economy, and the
exaggerated fears of an &quot;Islamic threat&#148; made silence rather than outrage the
policy of choice for the leading Western powers, including France and the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the coup,<sub> </sub>the country has descended into a vicious
bloodbath pitting extremists from whatever camp against one another. While the military
and some of its misguided allies in civil society have sought to transform this conflict
into an intra-civilizational debate in which the so- called secularists in the military
are doing everything in their power to project an image of noble defenders of the
country's modernity, development, democracy, and secularism, they have effectively failed
in this endeavor, losing even the support of one of the most &quot;fundamentalist
secularists,&quot; to borrow John Esposito's term, in the process, namely, Saad Sadi, the
leader of the chauvinistic Berberist party, the RCD - Rally for Democracy and Culture.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The behavior of the military and groups like the RCD in the face of a
popular will for democratic transformation reveals the stark reality of the current
situation, for these groups are neither democratic nor secularist but opportunists seeking
to maintain their privileged positions of power and influence against the will of the
majority of ordinary Algerians. In no way can these so-called secularists be defined as
possessing a rationalistic, scientific, modernistic, and democratic view of social and
political life. Indeed, guided by a strong sense of cultural and religious identity, the
&quot;lslamists&quot; are much more &quot;secular&quot; than their enemies for they view
the material world in a clear, rational, and scientific way, being able to clearly
distinguish the world of the spirit from its earthly counterpart.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center">Conclusion</b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">All this would remain academic given the overwhelming support most
Algerians give to political Islam as the appropriate instrument for achieving a democratic
peace, were it not for the decisive role of external actors whose multiple interventions
in the areas of military and intelligence support, economic aid, business investment, and
diplomatic advocacy have made it possible for the army to stay in power regardless of the
death tolls, human rights abuses, and damage to state and society. This damage to Algeria
and its peoples cannot long endure. One possible exit from this tragedy could begin with
the elimination of this false dichotomy artificially imposed on Algeria and other Arab and
Muslim countries, namely, that what is really at stake is a &quot;clash of
intra-civilization,&quot; when in fact it is a struggle, in its very essence, between
democracy and dictatorship. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">His Name Is Jonah</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By E. Yaghi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jonah is a beautiful blonde Jewish American boy with eyes as clear and
blue as the sky above us. He does not know hate or malice for he is only 2 years old.<br>
He smiles shyly at adults who comment on his cherub like appearance. One of his favorite
pals is a little Palestinian boy named Mohammed who is just old enough to push Jonah in
his stroller.<br>
Two children who have not yet been told that they might one day be enemies. Two children
living in America where the grass grows green and tulips grow pink and yellow and purple.
Where trees spread their leaves out to provide shade during hot summer days and lawnmowers
plow through oceans of green adding the scent of fresh cut grass to the aroma of a new
blossoming Spring where hope flies eternal.<br>
Jonah loves to waddle through sprinklers with Mohammed and cool off in the already humid
heat. He gleefully shares his rubber toy duck and bear with his slightly older friend
while Mohammed in turn, guards the small toddler so that no harm will come to him while
his mother baby sits Jonah.<br>
Mohammed too, is beautiful and has blue eyes and slightly darker blonde hair. His skin is
as fair as Jonah's. A world away, little boys Mohammed's age are throwing stones at
heavily armed Israeli patrols and toddlers Jonah's age absorb the news on flashing on TV
sets in their homes of Israeli troops chasing Palestinian children with tear gas grenades
and shooting at them with rubber bullets or live ammunition.<br>
Only last week, one of Mohammed&#146;s uncles from Gaza, died when Israelis at a
checkpoint, brutally beat him for transporting Palestinian workers without a permit. Three
men dragged Mohammed's uncle from his car and repeatedly beat him and stepped on his jaw
with their army boots until they heard a crack.<br>
But the broken jaw did not kill Mohammed's uncle. It was internal bleeding that did the
trick. And the uncle's family could only lament their son's death and do little to change
anything. Ah, yes, there were demonstrations and shouts by relatives and friends of the
young dead man<br>
to avenge the injustice he suffered. And such cries as, &quot;With our souls and blood we
will make you victorious oh Palestine!&quot;<br>
The day Mohammed's uncle was buried was the same day that Mohammed stood guard over his
little Jewish friend. The same day the two boys exchanged smiles, toys and laughter. But
then Jonah is not trying to take Mohammed&#146;s American home away from him, nor is he
trying to erase<br>
Mohammed's identity. There is no evil or malice in the hearts of either for their parents
have left both boys on their own to play together and enjoy each other as if they were
brothers.<br>
It wasn't so long ago that some Jewish settlers moved into Mohammed&#146;s Aunt's home and
when the aunt screamed and shouted and then fainted on the dry earth, she was dragged away
by Jonah's uncles. But Jonah, too young to comprehend such tragedies, has no concerns with
the outside world. What is important to him, is that he see and play with Mohammed every
day and have fun.<br>
It does not make sense that so much injustice does prevail in the remnants of Palestine
and that Jewish invaders pillage and plunder what once belonged to the indigenous
inhabitants of the beautiful Land of Milk and Honey. But what does make sense is that the
adorable Jonah and<br>
Mohammed have no inherent hate in their hearts and no evil intentions to hurt one another.
Children are what we make of them. Their babyhood is their Garden of Eden.<br>
Let us hope that one day Israeli and Palestinian children like Jonah and Mohammed will
grow up loving each other and walk hand in hand to build a future where there is no
injustice and where Jonahs no longer lead Mohammed&#146;s to prison.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Seeking The Wind, Reaping A Storm</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Erik Paul</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you are a person who has lived under an oppressive form of government,
at first, America will seem like a political utopia. At least in the U.S. the American
government as well as its president can be criticized without fear of reprisal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You can stand up on any street corner, or attend any political function
and vehemently denounce whatever government practice or policy you wish and you will feel
pretty sure that in those wee dark hours of the night, no secret police will arrest you.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, America is not an ideal place to raise children. There is so much
going on. Children are exposed to moral and spiritual corruption in all aspects of their
lives and there are very few TV programmes that are really suitable for your kids. Many
shows that label themselves as viewable for all members of the family are often spiced
with sensual innuendoes and a lack of family values. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And if they are not exposed to promiscuity in the American media, then
your children will often be exposed to violence. But quite sadly, many times, they will be
exposed to both. Too often for the young minds, saturated with an overabundance of sex,
evil and brutality, it is difficult to distinguish between what is real, what is not and
what role morality and social values have to play in the concrete world. Many American
families are secular. That is, they raise their children without any form of religion or
belief in God. Some parents do not even believe in God at all. Many children are now being
raised in one-parent homes. Those Muslims who do face the tremendously difficult task of
raising their children as pious and faithful followers of Islam in America have a great
responsibility and possibly a more difficult job than they would otherwise have.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the latest school shooting incidents in Colorado and now in Alabama
have posed a multitude of questions. One very confusing thought to many Americans is that
the youths who were guilty of turning their guns on their fellow students came from
well-to-do two-parent families, living in comfortable neighbourhoods. Where did all the
anger that these young people accumulate stem from? They were not impoverished. They
lacked nothing in material possessions nor the basic comforts and necessities of life.
Their parents were well educated and the children themselves never had to work for a
living or worry about where their next meal was coming from.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What then has gone so drastically wrong that young people without a care
in the world would even consider harming their classmates or fellow students? Is it that
their parents never made any effort to raise them as moral and responsible citizens? Did
their parents make no effort to instill in them a sense of human decency and the ability
to choose between right and wrong? Were the video and computer games and TV shows that
their children were playing and watching monitored? Were these youths exposed to such an
excessive amount of violent games and films that it made them feel that taking
another&#146;s life was as simple as tying their shoes?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 20 May, tragedy struck again when a 15-year-old sophomore wielding a
.22-calibre rifle began shooting at his schoolmates in Conyers, Georgia. Only one month
prior to this attack, two high school boys shot and killed 13 and injured 23 others in
their &#147;trench-coat&#148; Mafia attack. In Springfield, Oregon, 4 were killed and more
than 20 hurt on 21 May 1998. In Fayetteville, Tennessee, 1 was killed on 19 May 1998. In
Jonesboro, Arkansas, 5 were killed and 10 wounded on 24 March 1998. On 1 December 1997, in
West Paducah, Kentucky, 3 were killed and 5 injured, and in Pearl, Missouri on 1 October
1997, 3 were killed and 7 wounded.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Conyers, Georgia, when 15-year-old Thomas Solomon, Jr. began firing at
his schoolmates, the chatter and laughter in the school&#146;s common area turned into
screams of horror, chaos and a stampede of fear-struck students. Some students took cover
under benches and behind partitions, others raced outside the one-storey building, while
at least one teacher took students into a closet and recited Bible verses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But was the sudden urgency to return to religion too late? If prevention
is better than cure, then is there no hope to halt the disease? If President Clinton
preaches against violence and then without mercy leads NATO bombings on helpless civilians
in Yugoslavia and continues his war of genocide against the Iraqis, how does he then
expect his own citizens not to wage a war on themselves?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The best way to cleanse the American psyche is by doing a lot of
soul-searching and to bring the fear of God back into American society. Stricter rules
must also be passed that will keep lethal weapons out of the reach of children. The
Americans sought the wind, but because of their loose morals and lack of religion, have
reaped the storm. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, on the one hand, there is an abundance of political freedom, but on
the other, there is also an abundance of moral and spiritual corruption. Once the American
media begins to produce more wholesome products and computer and video games that promote
learning through clean and useful ways of having fun, and once the American government
stops killing the innocents all over the world, then perhaps school shootings will become
only a part of a sinister past instead of a new way of life.</p>
