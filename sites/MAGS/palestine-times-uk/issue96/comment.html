</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is quite nice that some Palestinian, Arab and Muslim leaders have
refrained from lauding the Zionist Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak. They have many good
reasons for doing so.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To begin with, Barak, like the rest of the Zionist warlords, is an
accomplished murderer and a career killer. He himself, in the course of his election
campaign, excessively boasted of and about his murderous record whether in Lebanon or in
the West Bank. (Obviously, he wouldn&#146;t have done that publicly had he not been
convinced of the &#147;magical effect&#148; this would have on a society that romanticizes
murder and bloodshed.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, it seems that the bitter experience of the past three years with
the outgoing Zionist premier Benyamin Netanyahu, whom some Arab statesmen initially gave
the benefit of the doubt, embittered them and made them a little wiser this time,
following the old adage &#147;once bitten, twice shy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat, whose tongue often
functions much more swiftly than his mind, was relatively circumspect in his reactions to
Barak&#146;s election victory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, who has been markedly less outspoken about this Israeli election
than he was about the 1996 election, said he wouldn&#146;t hasten to pass judgement on
Barak.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For his part, Barak himself vindicated in earnest Arab fears and doubts
about him. For soon after he was declared the winner on 17 May, he made it brashly clear
that while he and Netanyahu differed only on some domestic Zionist issues, they were
almost completely united in their opposition to Palestinian rights, including the right to
freedom, liberation and self-determination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak outlined four &#147;red lines&#148; he said he would not cross under
any circumstances.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These included: no returning East Jerusalem to the Palestinians; no
withdrawal to the 1967 borders; no dismantling Jewish settlements; and no Arab army west
of the river Jordan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak said what he said consciously and deliberately; so he meant what he
was saying, and he said it as precisely and concisely and, yes, as provocatively as
possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, some Arab leaders, who often act in total disregard of
their peoples&#146; interests, were not deterred by Barak&#146;s recalcitrant statements
and extremely hawkish posture.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, they did not find in his outspoken extremism a sufficient reason
for reconsidering their political calculations. This is sad and lamentable for two
reasons: </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Barak has been brazenly clear about his political stance. He is
adamantly opposed to the restoration of the very minimum of Palestinian rights, e.g. a
complete Israeli pull-out from the territories occupied in the 1967 war and the
establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the euphoria, which some gullible Arabs and Palestinians voice on
hearing such deceptive talk, soon gives way to depression or reasonable judgement when
they are made to understand that what Barak has in mind is only a small and innocuous
autonomous entity on 45%-55% of the West Bank and 65% of the Gaza Strip, without
Jerusalem, of course, and with virtually all Jewish settlements remaining under Zionist
sovereignty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. It is sufficiently clear that the Palestinian demographic and political
scene will not be able to withstand four more years of political deception and ineptitude,
of illusion, mirage and unfulfilled promises.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The West Bank, the very land where Arafat dreams to establish his
independent Palestinian State, is already congested with Jewish settlements, so much so
that one has no choice but to wonder if Arafat is really serious about his threats and
vows to that effect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What can the Palestinians do and how should they act in the face of these
gloomy prospects? Should they, as some advocates of capitulation argue, accept whatever is
given to them now on the ground that today&#146;s camel would be tomorrow&#146;s lamb and
after tomorrow&#146;s hen?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians must seek to rid themselves of the fettering and
humiliating shackles of Oslo, which gave the Zionists all the assets and the Palestinian
people all the liabilities, so much so that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
are left with virtually no water to drink. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But in order for the Palestinians to get the calamity of Oslo behind them,
they, or more correctly the Palestinian Authority, must first resign to the bitter reality
that Oslo has been a great blunder, even a gigantic fiasco.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This supposedly can be done through the organization of a free and
democratic election in the occupied territories to let the people decide. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only this can deliver the autocratic Palestinian leadership from its
enduring vulnerability to Zionist and American blackmail, and therefore, enable the
Palestinian masses to freely decide their fate. </p>
