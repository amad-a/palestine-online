<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">What Palestinian State? Wake up and Smell
the Political Coffee<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Khaled Issa </FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>A few weeks ago in an interview with the Jerusalem post, President Clinton
praised Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Self-Autonomy Authority,
for working for peace as demonstrated by his willingness: 1) to accept LESS
land than what was agreed upon previously under the Oslo Agreements, and
2)to clamp down on Hamas and other Palestinian activists. <BR>
In exchange for these additional Palestinian concessions however, the Netanyahu
government reciprocated with nothing! And similarly NOTHING tangible was
done by the U.S. government to control extremist Zionist policies and positions.
No serious American pressure was exerted on &quot;Israel&quot;, for example,
to halt colonization activity or administrative detention or the killing
of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators. As always, as usual, as we all know,
when push comes to shove American pressure on &quot;Israel&quot; is a plain
total absolute nothing...<BR>
Then Hillary Clinton, who notwithstanding Republican jokes is NOT a policy-maker,
seemed to fill that huge U.S. foreign policy bias with the mere HINT that
she supports the idea that Palestine should be a state. And as emotional
as we Arabs sometimes get, many of us began to sing her praises. Hers was
no Balfour Declaration!! It was not even the position of the White House.
Nothing tangible came out of it, and most importantly, it became for the
current U.S. administration a politically safe pacifier and a SUBSTITUTE
for what Mr. Clinton should have done to pressure &quot;Israel&quot; in
the way of giving concessions. Unfortunately however, Mrs. Clinton's plain
words, gave many good people among us a temporary illusory wonderful politically
inconsequential high, as much as it rationally shouldn't have!!<BR>
She thinks Palestine should be a state!...Well that sounds great, but what
Palestine is she talking about and for how many Palestinians exactly? Is
it the historical Palestine of 27,009 km squares? Or is it the 6,223 km
squares that is the size of the West Bank and Gaza (according to the Times
Atlas of the World, second edition, Random House, 1997)? Will this state
be the home for the over two million Palestinians in the West bank and Gaza
only, or will it be home for the over two million Palestinians in Jordan,
the one million Palestinian Arabs in the lands occupied in 1948, or the
other million and a half Palestinians elsewhere? <BR>
But in fact a little less than 40% of the Gaza strip is already taken up
by Zionist colonies, so out of 363 km squares that is Gaza, about 225 remain
unclaimed by &quot;Israel&quot;. And out of the 5,860 km squares that is
the West Bank, the negotiations revolve nowadays around Israeli withdrawal
from between 9 to 13 percent only; that would be around 527 to 762 km squares
of the West Bank. Thus combined, the area of the West bank and Gaza on which
the midget &quot;Palestinian state&quot; is to be gloriously and eventually
declared is less than 1,000 km squares in the best of cases, A LITTLE OVER
3 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AREA OF PALESTINE, FOR ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF PALESTINIANS!
That is, it will be a silly reservation! <BR>
In exchange, our prestigious Palestinian National Authority undertakes the
dirty job of reigning in Palestinians who might threaten &quot;Israel's&quot;
security. PRACTICAL GUARANTEES THAT THE STRUGGLE TO LIBERATE PALESTINE IS
BROUGHT TO A HALT ARE OBSERVED STRICTLY. Then with &quot;peace&quot; securely
in place, &quot;Israel&quot; gets to become the political and economic regional
superpower of the former Arab world. The midget &quot;Palestinian state&quot;
gets to play the proud role of Zionist stepping stone, but at least we would
get to have our independent Palestinian IDENTITY, and our own genuine Palestinian
assassins, jails, and torture sessions, after all the other Arabs are not
better than us!!<BR>
Do you remember when Oslo was first signed how the peddlers of defeatism
and surrender would address rejectionists with the lame line: what do you
mean Oslo is less than liberation? Take democracy now and this great step
towards a democratic &quot;Palestinian state&quot;...Well we saw what we
got! Neither democracy nor liberation, but the miscarriage of the Palestinian
cause under the banner of this midget &quot;Palestinian state&quot;, to
be delivered at the end of the struggle on about 3 percent of our land...
<BR>
That's why we should once and for all let it be known that what we struggle
for is our Palestine pure and simple, not this ambiguous motto of a &quot;Palestinian
state'!! The difference is not just the size of the area on which a state
is declared. If liberated ON OUR TERMS, then even half a percent of Palestine
could serve as a base for a Palestinian state, the difference being in the
terms. In the second case, the Palestinian state would be the beginning
not the end of the struggle, and Palestinians who kill and imprison other
Palestinians to protect the invaders, would then be appropriately treated
as all other people on this planet treat their traitors..</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Jerusalem's Final Status:<BR>
Other Critical Dimensions to the Jerusalem Question<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Muna Salman* </FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>SAN FRANCISCO (AAM) Final status negotiations are looming near. The fate
of Jerusalem, if negotiated and accepted by both parties of the conflict,
Palestinians and Israelis, could result in setting the stage for peace and
reconciliation or a countdown towards further regional instability, an outcome
unwanted by most. Israel's Likud is pushing for accelerated final status
talks in its belief that a hawkish Israel can wrest a better deal ignoring
in the process the bottom-line many Arabs and Muslims have set for a long
lasting peace--a return to the 1967 borders.<BR>
Over the decades, Jewish intellectuals in the U.S. have framed the Palestinian
tragedy in reductionist terms, using elemental arguments such as fighting
terrorism and security for Israel versus Palestinians' human and property
rights. A settlement ignoring the complexity of the Jerusalem question with
its Pan-Arab and Pan-Islamic aspects is bound to fail. Europe, owing to
its colonial heritage, has traditionally maintained a keener understanding
of the Mediterranean's historical dynamics. But many opinion leaders and
policy makers in the U.S. do not grasp the full dimension of the conflict
over Jerusalem and the baseline solution yet.<BR>
With the pro-Israeli U.S. pressure groups coalescing to pave the way for
a settlement favourable to Israel, the need to establish a single-issue
Arab and Muslim bloc is at its greatest today. The short time frame and
the unfavourable conditions for final status negotiations should leave little
doubt for the need to promote a clear pro-Jerusalem agenda strictly adhering
to UN resolutions in order to avoid political confusion from the outset.
Any revisionist interpretation of UN resolutions that does not return East
Jerusalem to its 1967 borders should be rejected.<BR>
Presently, Israel is aiming to introduce a series of neutered Jerusalem
options ranging form designating alternative sites such as Abu Deis as East
Jerusalem or other imaginative but still unacceptable alternatives such
as token authority over Muslim and some Christian holy sites in the Holy
City. While Israel and the U.S. may pressure PA Chairman Arafat into such
an arrangement, it will be a short-lived deal as demonstrated by Israel's
own de facto breach of signed agreements they later deemed counter to their
interests. Such a coerced arrangement is a recipe for disaster bound to
collapse if and when Arafat departs. Or possibly sooner.<BR>
Not too many Palestinians, let alone most Arabs and Muslims, would endorse
reconciliation with Israel when Palestinian authority over East Jerusalem
is not secured. To the contrary, Palestinian and Muslim disillusionment
will definitely lead into further mistrust and instability. And Jerusalem
will remain a festering sore with unpredictable outcomes. In this environment,
proponents of absolute solutions would undoubtedly win converts resulting
in strengthening the rejectionist camp. And Arafat's regime and those who
support it will be accorded the credibility and respect befitting of a Palestinian
Vichy.</P>

<P>A local conflict with global roots<BR>
Jerusalem to Arabs and Muslims is greater than the sum of its parts. It
is not about Palestinians and Israelis. It is not about Arabs and Zionists
or Jews and Muslims. Jerusalem is viewed by Arabs and Muslims as the focus
of an historical tug of war by which the West has sought to gain influence
and in the process has inflicted serious violence on the indigenous population
in particular and desecrated what is deeply sacred to Arabs and Muslims
in general. Jerusalem is like no other place for Arabs, both Muslims and
Christians, as well as Muslims of all ethnic backgrounds.<BR>
The legal, religious, geopolitical, historical and moral basis demanding
a shared Jerusalem with Palestinian authority over East Jerusalem is well
known and the solution is widely accepted in international foreign policy
circles. Regardless of the recent Israeli twists as to the pre-1967 status
of Jerusalem, it is today an occupied territory. No ifs, ands or buts about
it. UN resolutions leave even less doubt as to the legal status of East
Jerusalem.<BR>
Many Palestinians consider the religious and geopolitical significance of
Palestine to have been both a curse and a blessing. Had Muslims and Christians
not accorded Palestine with a measure of sacredness, chances are Palestinians
would have been marginalized. Also, Israel's geography has been burdened
by its wedge-like presence lodged at the heart of the Arab World. The symbolism
behind the Israeli-enforced Arab division has been deemed too painful and
too humiliating to accept. And Jerusalem, being at the heart of Palestine
and the Arab World, has been endowed by Arab nationalists of all faiths
with greater measures of reverence not accorded to other Arab cities. Similar
factors made Palestine an attractive but troublesome homeland for the Jews.<BR>
When analyzing the Arab and Muslim popular discourse on Jerusalem and the
historical psychology surrounding its loss, it conjures up images of waves
of violence coming from the West in the form of the Crusaders. Arabs, both
Muslims and Christians, have suffered immensely from the European's violent
campaign of racial and cultural dominance under religious pretexts. After
the Second World War, the loss of Jerusalem became a symbol of Western colonialism
and imperialism leading to the demise of the last Islamic Empire. Presently,
the steadfast support by the American Christian Right for total Israeli
control over Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories against the entreats
of Christian Arabs is a disturbing reminder of the West's historic and constantly
repeating role in this conflict.<BR>
To contemporary Arab and Muslim intellectuals, the establishment of Israel
highlights Western cynicism. After violently persecuting its Jews, Europe
managed to rid itself of its Orientals. With another cynical move, Europe
sponsored a settlement to the Jewish Question at the expense of the Palestinians
and returned later to arbitrate the same conflict they had created and made
a handsome profit selling weapons to the warring parties in the process.
The permanent loss of Jerusalem would be considered by Arabs and Muslims
as the West's most racist crowning achievement and would deepen wounds that
had begun to heal in the aftermath of the Second World War and the ensuing
wars of liberation.<BR>
If Jerusalem to the Jews is the symbol of return and an end to their exodus,
to Arabs and Muslims it is the focus of unconscionable Western-sponsored
racial violence against its indigenous population. The element of injustice
is too great to ignore, and the Western-instigated violence and ensuing
double standards are too grotesque to fathom and accept. The resulting discontent
gave birth to an increasing acceptance of militancy amongst Palestinians
who were traditionally docile agrarian people. This rising militancy has
been and continues to be a reaction to Jewish militancy and intransigence.<BR>
Given the complexity of the Jerusalem question, the only solution the Arabs
and Muslims seem prepared for as the absolute minimum will be along the
lines of the 1967 borders and supporting UN resolutions. In its absence,
a &quot;no deal&quot; leaves room for future negations. A &quot;bad deal&quot;
will widen the divide and could prove costly to both sides, potentially
expanding the scope of the conflict. Only the sharing of Jerusalem is a
good solution. A fair settlement would strengthen the forces of peace and
result in the eventual removal of the last vestige of centuries-long conflicts
between East and West.</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Sweet Dream Turns Sour?<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Azzam Tamimi*</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Fifty years ago the Jewish State of Israel was established in Palestine
by the Zionist movement. As an alleged fulfilment of a biblical prophecy,
or a divine promise, Israel was supposed to provide a safe haven for world
Jewry; any Jew anywhere in the world could leave his home and travel to
Palestine, acquire Israeli citizenship and realize his dream of returning
to the Promised Land. By invoking the Bible, the secularist--mostly agnostic--pioneers
of Zionism sought to rally support for the project. Before the Holocaust,
this project not only attracted the support of a small number of Jews, but
was also met with strong opposition in Orthodox Jewish circles because of
its violation of the Jewish creed itself, which prohibited Jews from returning
to the Promised Land until the coming of the Messiah.<BR>
In celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Jewish State, many Jews have
been reflecting on the dream that came true. Some of them admit, as has
been shown by the numerous TV and radio programmes and press articles prepared
for this occasion, that the dream has not been that sweet.<BR>
To start with, less than a third of world Jews have opted to benefit from
the Law of Return and settle down in Palestine. What was supposed to be
a country for all the Jews has proven to be a country for only a minority
of them, especially for those who have been compelled to migrate to it.<BR>
Examples are numerous, but one may cite the exodus out of Europe in the
aftermath of the Second World War when Jews, thanks to Hitler and then the
victors in the war, were given no other alternative if they had to flee
the hell of Europe, which no longer wanted them. The U.S. government itself
did not want at the time any more Jews to migrate to the United States.
Jews of Arab origin, who left their homes in Yemen, Iraq, Egypt and North
Africa, would not have done so had it not been for the intimidating policy
of the Zionist agency who went as far as bombing synagogues in Iraq to compel
the Jews to flee. Another more recent case is that of the Ethiopian Jews.<BR>
Famine, civil war and regional politics provided an ideal opportunity for
them to set their eyes on a place that was at the time definitely safer
and more comfortable than the home of their ancestors in Ethiopia. There
is also the case of the Russians, who would have been delighted to go to
America, their real Promised Land, had they been permitted to do so. They
were forced to go to Palestine after the United States denied them entry
visas. Many of them who settled in Palestine continue to have their eyes
set on America.<BR>
Secondly, the state of Israel has not been able to maintain its original
secularist socialist character. Although the original Zionists used the
Biblical promise for purely technical reasons, it was bound to backfire,
as it did more vigorously during the past ten years or so.<BR>
Perhaps the founders of Zionism thought they could get away with turning
Jews into a nation that could be rallied behind a nationalist cause without
evoking Jewish religious dogma and whatever myths associated with it.<BR>
Fifty years after the establishment of the Jewish state, such presuppositions
have been proven wrong. This is the main dilemma now facing secularist Jews
inclined toward some form of peace with the Palestinians and the rest of
the Arab world. The phenomenon of Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza
is striking evidence that Zionism bore within it the seed of self-destruction.
Interviews with representatives of these settlers, who come from as far
as Latin America, North America and the former republics of the Soviet Union,
show clearly that they justify the occupation of Palestinian land and the
displacement of the original inhabitants on purely religious grounds, specifically
that God promised the Israelites this land, which they allege was the home
of their ancestors more than 2,500 years ago. A secularist discourse that
is willing to exchange land for peace is irreligious in the eyes of the
settlers, who claim they only came to Palestine in response to a divine
call. It is this divine call that is now tearing the Jewish population of
occupied Palestine into pieces and is threatening to set fire to this edifice
that seems less resilient in the face of internal threats than to external
ones.<BR>
Thirdly, Jews who came to settle in the Promised Land discovered, to their
dismay, the falsity of the Zionist myth that Palestine was a land without
a people for a people without a land. The land had, and still has, a people.
Some of them live in pockets of populations here and there in the West Bank
and Gaza, but the majority of them are in refugee camps in neighbouring
Arab countries, still waiting to return. The Jewish inhabitants of Palestine
offer all kinds of solutions. Some suggest that Palestinians should be transferred
to other Arab countries because there is plenty of land there to take them,
whereas Palestine is too small for the two peoples; anyway, it is divinely
allocated exclusively for the Jews. Others suggest that Palestinians already
displaced should be settled and turned into citizens of the countries they
are already in. Those who remain in the West Bank and Gaza, it is suggested,
may remain and be ruled by a Palestinian administration with very little
sovereignty and must report regularly to the Israelis (the Oslo-based settlement).<BR>
Fourth, the utopian Jewish democracy has been exposed as a project set up
on a shaky foundation of deceit, aggression and racism. What is interesting
to note, as Israel celebrates its fiftieth anniversary, is that this very
ugly face of Israel is becoming obvious not only to third parties in Europe,
America or elsewhere in the world, but also to some Israeli Jews as well.
The more this painful reality becomes obvious to more Jews, the more they
will agonize over how they have, whether directly or indirectly, played
a part in realizing it. The more Jews that awake from their sombre, the
more difficult, and the more costly, it will be for Israel to exist.<BR>
Fifth, Israel's success, not only in neutralizing the traditional Palestinian
resistance movement (the PLO) but also in turning it into a policeman commissioned
with all the dirty work that was previously taken care of by the Israeli
occupation troops, is a short-lived success. When a wave of resistance is
pacified, a more formidable resistance movement emerges. This is the story
of the struggle that has been going on in Palestine long before Israel was
established in response to foreign occupation. What distinguishes the current
wave of resistance, led by Hamas, is that it has the broadest base ever
since the occupation of Palestine in 1948. Hamas, unlike the PLO, does not
believe it is capable alone of liberating Palestine, hence it does not call
itself a liberation movement. The task of liberation is too big for a local,
or even a regional, group to undertake singularly. Sharing the burden with
1 billion Muslims, one fifth of the world's population, is the strategy
of this resistance movement.<BR>
However, for liberation to take place, a change in the global balance of
powers, which has since the turn of the century been in favour of creating
a state for the Jews in Palestine, would have to take place. It is no secret
that Israel could not be created, and could not have survived this long,
without the financial aid and military support of the West, especially the
United States of America. <BR>
Palestinians who believe that their land will one day return to them, or
to their children, are confident that local, regional and global changes
are in the making. They are hopeful that Israel will not live to celebrate
its centennial anniversary. If any has doubt that this is possible, history
is recommended as a reminder that it is indeed possible.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">B'Tselem exposes torture methods of Israel's General
Security Service</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>On 19 May 1998, B'Tselem released a report that presents an up-to-date
and detailed picture of the interrogation methods used by the General Security
Service (GSS). B'Tselem estimates, based on official sources, human rights
organizations and attorneys, that the GSS annually interrogates between
1,000-1,500 Palestinians. Some 85% of them-at least 850 persons a year-are
subjected to methods that constitute torture. The report includes a detailed
description of the methods, including extracts from testimonies and medical
documents. The case of Omar Ghneimat, whose torture caused permanent disability,
is presented as an example, including the High Court discussion of his case
and the decision of the Department for the Investigation of Police not to
take any measures against his interrogators.</P>

<P>The following are the principle methods:</P>

<P>1. Detention Conditions: Palestinian detainees are held in complete isolation
from the outside world, in cramped and filthy conditions. They are not allowed
to change clothes, even during interrogations that last months. They must
eat with their hands in toilet stalls.<BR>
2. Shabeh Combination Description: Shabeh is a combination of methods, used
for prolonged periods, entailing sensory isolation, sleep deprivation and
infliction of pain. Regular shabeh entails shackling the detainee's hands
and legs to a small chair, angled to slant forward so that the detainee
cannot sit in a stable position. The interrogee's head is covered with an
often-filthy sack and loud music is played non-stop through loudspeakers.
Detainees in shabeh are not allowed to sleep. Sleep deprivation is achieved
by using the aforementioned methods and by having a guard wake up any detainee
who dozes off. <BR>
In many cases, the GSS add to and vary shabeh as follows: &quot;Refrigerator&quot;-exposing
the interrogee to an air-conditioner blowing cold air directly at him. Standing
shabeh-compelling the detainee to stand, his arms tied behind him attached
to a pipe affixed to the wall. Standing shabeh with the detainee's arms
drawn backward and upward, so that the upper body is forced forward and
down.<BR>
Duration: The GSS generally uses shabeh for several days at a time, with
short breaks to be resumed for several weeks at a time. <BR>
Position of the State: The GSS and the State Attorney's Office admit to
using shabeh, at least &quot;regular shabeh.&quot;<BR>
3. Threats and Curses Description: Interrogators use this method during
the interrogation itself. They threaten to murder the interrogee, mentioning
detainees who died during interrogation or detention, and to harm his relatives.
Some of these threats are of a sexual nature.<BR>
The State's Position: The State's Attorney tends to ignore complaints of
threats and curses. However, in response to a compensation suit, the State
recently acknowledged that interrogators use threats and curses.<BR>
4. Qas'at a-Tawleh (Painful Stretching using a Table and Direct Pressure)
Description: This method has been used with increasing frequency during
the past two years. The method combines a painful position with the application
of direct violence by the interrogator, and is used during the interrogation
itself. The interrogator compels the interrogee to kneel or sit down (on
the floor or on the shabeh chair) in front of a table, with the detainee's
back to the table. The interrogator places the interrogee's arms, bound
and stretched behind him, on the table. The result is intense pain. Sometimes
the interrogator sits on the table, his feet on the interrogee's shoulders,
and pushes the interrogee's body forward, stretching his arms even more,
or pulls his legs, creating the same painful effect. <BR>
Duration: Interrogators are liable to force the interrogee to remain in
this position for hours, with the interrogators adding the direct pressure
at will.<BR>
The State's Position: The State has not admitted to using this method and
has not directly addressed it in its response to High Court petitions that
included complaints of its use. However, it has, as mentioned previously,
admitted to applying pressure by compelling the interrogee to remain in
various positions.<BR>
5. Qambaz (the &quot;Frog Position&quot;) Description: The GSS uses this
method during the interrogation itself. The interrogator compels the interrogee
to kneel on his toes, his arms tied behind him. If the interrogee falls,
the interrogator forcefully compels him to return to the position, at times
by beating and kicking him.<BR>
Duration: Interrogators are liable to force the interrogee to remain in
this position for hours, sometimes with breaks interspersed. <BR>
The State's Position: The State admitted to using qambaz as an interrogation
method for up to an hour each time.<BR>
6. Violent Shaking Description: In this method, direct, potentially lethal,
force is applied. It is used during the interrogation itself. The interrogator
grabs the interrogee, who is sitting or standing, by the lapels of his shirt,
and shakes him violently, so that the interrogator's fists beat the chest
of the interrogee, and his head is thrown backward and forward.<BR>
Duration: Violent shaking lasts for several seconds-up to five seconds according
to testimonies-each time.<BR>
The State's Position: The State admits to using violent shaking as an interrogation
method. In April 1995, 'Abd a-Samad Harizat died as a result of being violently
shaken by GSS interrogators. Even though the State acknowledged this, and
though it could not guarantee unequivocally that violent shaking would not
cause deaths in the future, or even less severe injuries, it has continued
to use this method.<BR>
7. Slapping, Beating, Kicking and Causing Direct Pain by Use of Shackles
Description: These violent methods are used during the interrogation. In
addition to slapping, punching and kicking, the interrogators tighten the
shackles to cause pain greater than that normally suffered when remaining
shackled for a prolonged period. One of these violent methods is where the
GSS interrogator tightens the shackles and, grasping the shackles, drags
the interrogee along the floor.<BR>
The State's Position: The State does not admit to using these methods. However,
the Landau Commission also mentioned &quot;a slap to the face&quot; as being
a legitimate interrogation technique.</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Yassin's extended Arab-Muslim tour angers
Palestinian Authority<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem (20 May) The ongoing, high-profile tour by Hamas founder
and leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, of several Arab and Muslim countries has
generated a preponderance of consternation on the part of Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority. While the PA has not publicly reacted to the generally
warm welcome that Yassin received both on the official and popular levels,
the heavily censored Palestinian media nearly completely ignored the Sheikh's
tour. <BR>
Moreover, some PA officials could not hide their anxiety that Yassin's extended
trip was &quot;at the expense of the PA, harmful to the peace process&quot;
and even meant to &quot;incite trouble against the PA.&quot;<BR>
Nabil Amre, one of Yasser Arafat's closest advisers, signaled the Palestinian
leadership's dismay at Yassin's &quot;inflammatory remarks&quot; against
the Oslo peace process, saying the remarks were &quot;harmful to national
unity.&quot; Speaking from Gaza via Dubai's satellite, Amre labeled the
plethora of television interviews that Yassin (he didn't mention him by
name) had given as &quot;a campaign of political sabotage.&quot; Amre complained
that Yassin's &quot;media blitz&quot; was weakening Arab and Muslim support
for the PA and the peace process, which he said was incompatible with Palestinian
national interests. <BR>
Incensed by Yassin's outspoken criticisms of and attacks on the Oslo process,
PA officials reportedly sought unsuccessfully to convince some of Yassin's
hosts not to receive him or at least to try to convince him to &quot;tone
down his vitriolic statements.&quot; An exception, however, was the refusal
by the South African government of Nelson Mandela to grant Yassin an entry
visa into the country, reportedly at Yasser Arafat's request. Ironically,
while the PA found some solace in the South African measure, Yassin reacted
by escalating his tone, vowing to resume resistance soon against the Israeli
occupation, irrespective of what the PA says or feels.<BR>
However, what seems to have angered the PA most was the conceivably wide
popular support that Hamas may have gained among the sizeable Palestinian
expatriate communities throughout the Gulf region as well as among the wider
Arab and Muslim public opinion.<BR>
In Iran, for example, Sheikh Yassin had audience with the country's top
Islamic leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamena'e, as well as with President Khatami
and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to some reports,
Khamena'e referred to Yassin as &quot;the real representative of the Palestinian
people.&quot; Needless to say, such words and the grave message they carry
are anathema to the PA, which views with ample anxiety any suggestion that
its representation of the Palestinian people is questionable or objectionable.<BR>
More to the point, the PA was disquieted particularly by the effective use
of the media by Yassin. Many of Yassin's galvanizing speeches in the Gulf
States were aired during prime time by such popular Arab satellite TV stations
as the Qatar-based al Jazira and al Sharja, thus enabling many Palestinians
in the occupied territories to watch them, especially after being re-aired
by local television stations.<BR>
Furthermore, Yassin's successful campaign against the Oslo peace process
and the &quot;PA subservience to its humiliating dictates&quot; could not
have come at a better time, given the moribund state of that process and
its manifest failure to extract Palestinian rights from Netanyahu's parsimonious
hands. Indeed, Sheikh Yassin seems to have succeeded not only in vindicating
Hamas' &quot;resistance choice&quot; but also in illustrating the futility
of any reliance on American and Israeli &quot;good will.&quot; Clearly,
his words to that effect amounted to a tacit but unmistakable attack on
Yasser Arafat's PA, often perceived as having trusted the fate of Palestinian
rights to the &quot;honest broker,&quot; the United States. <BR>
The Sheikh's statements and views acquired even additional veracity and
credibility after the failure of the 4 May London talks that the Sheikh
had predicted and the subsequent failed mission to the region by US peace
envoy Dennis Ross. He rightly pointed out in a television interview in Sharja
that the agenda-setters of American policy on Palestine were nearly all
American Jewish Zionists who hold views very much similar to those held
by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and other extremist Israeli
leaders. <BR>
Moreover, the Sheikh described vividly the utter intolerability of the present
situation in the occupied territories, arguing that the PA and Hamas alike,
as well as the rest of the Palestinian people, were still fettered by the
shackles of the Israeli occupation. Seeking to dramatize his point, Yassin
pointed out that even PA Chairman Yasser Arafat cannot move from place to
place within the autonomous enclaves without Israeli consent, which proves
that the Oslo peace process amounted to a sort of capitulation on the part
of the Palestinians.<BR>
Never the less, the Palestinian Islamist leader was careful throughout his
tour not to personally attack or insult PA Chairman Yasser Arafat. In fact,
Yassin reiterated several times the declared Islamist stance that &quot;the
Islamist movement would not allow under any circumstances inter-Palestinian
fighting to take place.&quot;<BR>
&quot;This is a red line,&quot; said Yassin in response to a question by
a caller during a phone-in programme on the al Jazira satellite television
station, adding, &quot;we have to take the lesser of the two evils in this
case.&quot;<BR>
Yassin's tour is viewed here as a great plus for Hamas, which flies in the
face of American and Israeli efforts to isolate and weaken the Movement
by cutting off its &quot;money line&quot;, which presumably originates in
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region. <BR>
Islamist leaders here expect the Movement to become stronger as a result
of Yassin's tour. It is rumoured that Yassin has been able to secure millions
of dollars of financial support for the Movement, basically from wealthy
Gulf sympathizers who saw in him an example of the &quot;clean Palestinian
leader&quot; who, unlike the present PA leadership, does not compromise
Arab Muslim rights and does not give up in the face of Israeli-American
pressure.</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The Nakba - 50 Years of Endless Suffering<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By The Islamic Bloc in Bir Zeit University
- Palestine</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Bir Zeit - After exactly 50 years of its establishment, the Israeli State
insisted on reminding the Palestinian people and the whole world, by killing
more than 9 Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank last Thursday, that Israel
is determined to continue its aggression against the Palestinian people.
This is not their first crime. Since its establishment 50 years ago and
up till the present, the Israeli State continues to oversee the killing,
expulsion and repression of the Palestinian people. That is why this sad
occasion is called Al Nakba (the catastrophe).<BR>
The Nakba is not only about the past and the awful crimes and massacres
committed by the Israeli army in the 1948 war, but it is also about the
present and future, as consecutive Israeli governments have followed the
bloody path that the first Israeli government began 50 years ago. Until
today, the Israeli State not only refuses to fix the injustice of the past,
but also commits more and more crimes, summarized as follows:<BR>
1. More than 4 million Palestinian refugees are forbidden by the Israeli
State from entering Palestine, even to Palestinian controlled territories.
If we add to them more than 1 million Palestinian refugees on their own
land, we will have a total of 5 million refugees that Israel has expelled
from their homes 50 years ago, and refuses even to discuss their issue.<BR>
2. Israel continues to hold more than 5,000 political Palestinian prisoners
and another few hundred prisoners from different Arab countries. Most of
them are being tortured in a brutal and systematic way. Israel is not satisfied
with all of these prisoners, and continues to pressure the PA to arrest
more and more Palestinians for political reasons.<BR>
3. Israel continues to hide information about hundreds of missing Arab POWs
who disappeared in Israeli jails; most of them disappeared in the early
1970s.<BR>
4. The continuous confiscation and stealing of agricultural land, which
thousands of Palestinian families depend upon for their living. <BR>
5. The continuous siege on the Palestinian territories that began more than
eight years ago, in addition to the humiliating way Israeli soldiers treat
Palestinian civilians when crossing the borders to Jordan and Egypt.<BR>
6. The current Israeli government is comprised of war criminals, especially
Sharon and Etan, both of whom were involved directly in the horrors committed
by the Israeli army during the invasion of Lebanon in 1982.<BR>
7. Continuous attempts to attack and destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque and other holy
sites. The last attempt was on Wednesday, 13 May, when Jewish terrorists
blew up one of the gates of Al-Aqsa Mosque.<BR>
If we continue to mention the crimes of the Israeli State, we will never
finish. But it is obvious that the Israeli State is following an ethnic
cleansing policy since 1948.<BR>
We want the whole world to know that unless the Palestinian people retrieve
ALL of their legitimate rights, there will be no justice. When there is
no justice, there will not and should not be peace in the Middle East. The
coming explosion will not be stopped unless the whole world stands in front
of the racist Israeli government and forces it to stop violating the human
and political rights of the Palestinian people.<BR>
Finally, we want to remind you that fighting occupation and fighting for
freedom and justice is a sacred right for every person in the world. So
neither Israel and its collaborators, nor the U.S. government has the right
to stand in front of those who fight for their people's rights and for ending
one ugly chapter of human history.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Who killed Muhi a-Din a-Sharif?<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Roni Ben Efrat*</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>On Sunday, March 29, around nine in the evening, a Fiat Uno exploded
at a garage in Betunia, next to Ramallah. Nearby was the body of Muhi a-Din
a-Sharif, known as Engineer # 2.<BR>
His death is a mystery that may never be solved. While Israel keeps mum,
the accounts of the Palestinian Authority (PA) have flip-flopped almost
as rapidly as the weather at this time of year. Both sides had reasons for
wanting Sharif dead: Israel, because it holds him responsible for the preparation
of bombs that killed 65 people; the PA, because the military wing of Hamas,
in which he was a leader, threatens to undermine its authority on all fronts.
Likewise, either side could have strong reasons for hiding its involvement.
Of the two threads that might conceivably lead somewhere, Israel holds one,
namely, the wreckage of the car, and the PA the other: a 19-year-old student
named Ghassan Adasi, whose confession it claims to have.<BR>
The death poses a test for the PA. At issue are its relations with Israel
and the US, on the one hand, and with its own people on the other. Unless
Arafat and his forces can demonstrate that they are firmly in control, Israel
will not be willing to inch forward, however haltingly and partially, in
the &quot;peace process.&quot; The PA must demonstrate its willingness and
ability to hold Hamas down, yet it must also show that it can keep its credibility
with the Palestinian people. If it killed Sharif, or helped in his killing,
that will gain it points with Israel and the US. But it must not be seen
to have done so.<BR>
Within Hamas itself, the death also poses a test. If the Islamic movement
smoothes over the question of who killed one of its leaders, then it will
lose face with the people - whether or not it avenges him by an attack against
Israel.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Who killed Muhi a-Din a-Sharif? First account (March 30 - April 1)
:&quot;hoist by his own petard.&quot;</B><BR>
The garage where the Uno blew up on March 29 is in Area A, where the PA
is supposed to control everything, including security. Nearby is the prison
of the PA's Preventive Security Force, run by Jibril Rajoub.<BR>
In a sterling example of security cooperation, the PA allowed Israel's experts
to survey the area of the blast. The latter reported finding a large quantity
of material for making bombs, similar, it claimed, to that uncovered at
Hamas laboratories in Nablus and Beit Sahour. The first and major explosion,
the Israelis asserted, came not from the car, but from elsewhere in the
garage; it ignited a small amount of explosive material that was in the
car. (Ha'aretz, April 2.)<BR>
The PA sent the wreckage of the Fiat to Israeli police headquarters, which
has held it ever since.<BR>
The day after the blast, March 30, the PA published an obscure provisional
announcement, reporting that there had been an explosion and that two Palestinians
had been killed. One it did not identify; the second was said to be a PA
security officer. (On April 1 it withdrew the report concerning this second
victim.) The explosion, the PA also stated, was probably the result of what
is euphemistically called a &quot;work accident,&quot; apparently related
to Hamas. In other words, someone was killed while preparing a bomb.<BR>
In fact, PA officials had quickly identified Sharif (his face had not been
damaged), but they were waiting for Chairperson Yassir Arafat to return
from abroad. The first to inform the family were not Palestinians at all,
rather members of Israel's General Security Services (GSS or &quot;Shin
Beth&quot;). Roni Ben Efrat and Diana Mardi of Challenge heard the family's
account of that conversation during a visit to their home in Beit Hanina
on April 9.</P>

<P><B>Who killed Muhi a-Din a-Sharif? Second account (April 2-6): &quot;Israel
did it.&quot;</B><BR>
The PA's chief pathologist, Dr. Jalal Jabri, performed an autopsy on the
body. He found three bullets, two in the lungs and one in a leg. (He reasoned
that Sharif had first been shot in the leg to prevent escape.) The doctor
also established that at the time of the explosion, Sharif had already been
dead three hours.<BR>
Despite these findings, Amir Oren, a veteran Israeli journalist, stuck to
the original story: &quot;According to the security forces, which in the
course of their work were privy to the secrets of various operations, the
police report from the (Israeli) Laboratory for Criminal Identification
- as well as other reports - clearly show that the bullets that entered
Sharif's body constituted a lethal part of the explosive device.&quot; (Ha'aretz,
April 2, 1998).<BR>
It is conceivable, indeed, that a bullet from a bomb Sharif was making flew
to his heart. But it must be counted as nothing short of a miracle that
this should happen three hours before the bomb exploded.<BR>
The PA was less inclined to believe in miracles. Faced with the findings,
its response was to invite Dr. Jabri to the Preventive Security Offices,
interrogate him, and suspend him from his job. All our efforts to locate
him and talk with him have so far proved futile.<BR>
The doctor's findings, however - followed by the fury of the mass funeral
on April 2 - led to a change in the PA's account. For the first time, it
pointed an accusing figure at Israel. From April 2 until April 6, the PA
claimed to be checking two possibilities: either Sharif was shot by Palestinians
collaborating with Israel or directly by Israel itself. It had also re-opened,
it said, the question of &quot;where exactly the killing occurred, before
the body was brought to the garage.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Who killed Muhi a-Din a-Sharif? Third account (April 6 - ): &quot;Internal
struggles in Hamas&quot; </B><BR>
On April 6 the PA's Preventive Security chief, Jibril Rajoub, came out with
a surprise announcement at a press conference in Ramallah. It remains, in
one variant or another, the PA's version today: &quot;Adel Awadallah killed
Muhi a-Din a-Sharif in the course of an internal struggle for control over
Iz a-Din al-Kassam (the military wing of Hamas).&quot; Rajoub claimed to
have the confession of an eye witness, Hamas activist Ghassan Adasi. Not
only was Adasi present during the argument and shooting, said Rajoub, but
he had also - under Adel Awadallah's command - created the car bomb in order
to cover up the murder. Rajoub sent this account to the local branch of
the CIA, whose agents then received a guided tour of the garage in Betunia.<BR>
Thus Rajoub threw the ball into the Hamas court, and the Islamic organization
now had no alternative but to respond. Its political leadership (including
Abed al Aziz Rentisi and Ismail Abu Shanav) rejected the new story and stuck
to the notion that Israel was responsible. Then, on April 8, Reuters received
and broadcast a homemade videotape, featuring a man who claimed to be Adel
Awadallah. (He had wrapped a kaffiyah across his face, guerrilla-style).
Awadallah (if it was he) vehemently denied the new PA version, saying that
Muhi a-Din had been like a brother to him. He accused the PA, and especially
Jibril Rajoub, of collaborating with Israel in the assassination of Sharif.
Nevertheless, he continued, Hamas should direct its reprisals only against
Israel. A circular of Iz a-Din al-Kassam appeared that same day reaffirming
this position.<BR>
In a meeting with Challenge on April 9, Sharif's brother Izhak told us:
&quot;I don't belong to Hamas, but I don't accept the new PA version, nor
does my family. The members of Iz a-Din al-Kassam compete with each other,
true, but not over position, rather over who will make the greater sacrifices.
They don't get involved with assassinating even Fatah people - how then
can anyone expect us to believe that they'd kill each other?&quot;<BR>
Ha'aretz correspondent Amira Hass has also held consistently to this point:
&quot;Assassination as a means of settling internal struggles is characteristic
of Fatah, not Hamas.&quot; (Ha'aretz, April 7, 1998.)</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Holes in the story</FONT></H3>

<P><B>1. The Adasi family</B><BR>
The latest PA version, just quoted, rests mainly on the confession of Ghassan
Adasi, 19, a student at Bir Zeit University, who was supposed to be a candidate
of the Islamic bloc in the student elections of March 30. <BR>
Diana Mardi and I visited Adasi's home in al-Bireh on April 9. Many people
were present, including most of the family members, who had been arrested
in connection with the case and released. They were unanimous in their account:
On the day of Sharif's death, Ghassan was at home all afternoon and evening,
except around 6:15, when he went to the mosque. He returned from prayer
within the hour and remained at home until his arrest several hours after
the explosion. The oldest brother, Issam, spoke as follows: &quot;If they
were to bring Ghassan before me right now, and if he were to tell me that
he himself killed Muhi a-Din, I'd tell him he was a liar, because he was
with me, and I'm ready to testify to that in any courtroom.&quot; <BR>
On April 27 we spoke once again with Issam Adasi. He said that no one had
seen Ghassan since the night of his arrest. According to what the family
had heard, he had retracted his confession. Now they feared for his life.
In their effort to visit him, they had retained a lawyer, Khader Shakirat,
and they had brought Amnesty International into the case. Bir Zeit University
has also sent out alerts.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. The Awadallah family</B><BR>
On April 22, we visited the parents and wife of Imad Awadallah. They too
contest the PA's version. Shifa, his wife, states firmly: &quot;Imad was
in hiding with me. We lived in an apartment near Betunia. He couldn't go
out. I am ready to swear in whatever setting you want that he was with me
and the children at home for five days continuously before the explosion.&quot;
On April 11 at seven in the morning, Palestinian security troops surrounded
their hideout. (Among them was Shifa's brother.) How did they find it? They
had arrested Amer, Imad's brother, on April 6th in the mosque. It is possible
that under torture he told them. Today both brothers are under arrest, and
no lawyer can see them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. Further questions</B><BR>
Apart from the testimonies of the Adasi and Awadallah families, there are
other reasons to doubt the PA's latest account and, beyond that, to suspect
its involvement in the death of Sharif. <BR>
First, the PA kept changing the story. If you do not know what happened,
you wait to find out. Who does not wait? Someone who knows what happened
- and wants to cover it up with a different account. <BR>
The PA's first account would have sufficed, had it not been for the findings
of the pathologist. It promptly suspended him, and he has not been heard
from since.<BR>
The PA arrested Ghassan Adasi and four other members of his family on the
night of Sharif's death. It released his father and three brothers the next
day. Why did it keep Ghassan? Had he broken down and confessed? This does
not quite make sense. If he had already made the confession that the PA
later attributed to him (strife within Hamas), why then did the PA (faced
with the pathologist's findings) come out with a different account, namely,
the accusation against Israel, maintaining this for five days?<BR>
The PA was warned to lay off Israel, and only then did it come forth with
Ghassan's confession. But here too it ran into a problem: the Hamas videotape.
The PA found the masked man believable enough, it seems, to alter what Ghassan
had allegedly said. No, it wasn't Adel, after all, who killed Sharif, but
rather Adel's brother, Imad.<BR>
Nor does Ghassan's alleged confession make sense. It presents the killing
as a spontaneous act, the result of an argument, followed by a hastily improvised
cover-up: a 19-year-old student, apprentice to the murdered man, prepares
a car bomb and sets it for 8:45, giving the killer enough time to escape.
But Hamas is an organization. One of its members cannot spontaneously kill
a top leader and expect to get away with it, coolly leaving another member
behind, a witness who - we are supposed to believe - then risked his life
preparing a bomb to go off in a garage where his family rents space. Wouldn't
the witness report, instead, back to Hamas?<BR>
Suppose, however, that the killing was not spontaneous. Suppose that someone
higher up in Hamas had sent Imad Awadallah to kill Sharif, that Ghassan
was part of the plot, and that Ghassan, confessing and fearing reprisal,
had tried to play down his role. But if the murder had been planned in advance,
would the Hamas leader have chosen a garage where the Adasi family rents
space - knowing that the family, including Ghassan, would then be interrogated?<BR>
Furthermore, if Hamas killed Sharif, why would it attempt to cover up the
murder by staging a &quot;work accident,&quot; making its people look incompetent
and gratifying the Israelis? Why not leave the body with the bullets in
it, since the natural suspects would be Israel or the PA?<BR>
Another oddity: According to the confession, the blast was intended to blur
the marks of the shooting. But Sharif's body was found at a distance from
the car, behind a pillar, relatively undamaged. According to the family
members who identified him, the bullet holes in his chest were quite apparent.
If the intent had been to blur the marks, wouldn't it have made more sense
to put the body in the car and blow it to bits? Whoever killed Sharif wanted
him to be identified and did not mind if the bullet holes were seen. <BR>
Finally, if the PA has at last uncovered and revealed the true account,
why doesn't it let the key witnesses meet with their lawyers? And where
is that pathologist?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Who has the key to what happened?</B><BR>
In the case of Engineer # 1, Yehieh Ayyash, Israel did not deny responsibility
for the killing, and there followed a series of bloody reprisals which cost
Shimon Peres the election. In the present instance, Israel does not want
to take credit, even tacitly, out of fear of a repeat performance. The PA,
for its part, wants to show the US it is doing its bit, but it does not
want to expose the full extent of its cooperation for fear of losing out
to Hamas in the eyes of the people. As a result, the only party that is
in a position to examine itself and reveal its findings is Hamas. It can
ask when its members last saw Sharif, where he was living, who his contacts
were. It remains a question, however, whether Hamas is interested in revealing
the truth. <BR>
At the height of the crisis, while the PA was arresting dozens of Hamas
people, calls began to resound on all sides for a &quot;cease fire&quot;
in the war of words. There were even rumors of meetings in Gaza between
the two sides, although Hamas leader Sheikh Mahmud al-Zahar denied them
in a statement to Challenge on April 15. It is clear, in any case, that
Hamas is exhibiting extraordinary - some might say embarrassing - restraint.
People close to the movement explain this by referring to apprehensions
of civil war. One of them told us that if Hamas were to publish all it knew,
some hothead might assassinate Jibril Rajoub, sending the Territories into
a tailspin of factional infighting, that is, Lebanonization. Whatever the
case may be, the Islamic movement is indeed behaving for now as if the affair
were a potato too hot to hold.<BR>
On the other hand, if Hamas avoids finding out what it can - if it smoothes
over the assassination of Muhi a-Din a-Sharif as it did the extradition
of the two from Tzurif - then it will have given Arafat a green light to
carry on with his dictatorship of blood. Even if the PA had not laid the
responsibility for Sharif's death at its door, Hamas would owe it to itself,
indeed to all Palestinians, to find out and report how one of its leaders
came to be assassinated. Otherwise it will not be able to maintain its status
as a serious opposition. Nor can it evade this task by launching reprisals
against Israel. If the PA had a part in the murder of Muhi a-Din a-Sharif,
then it is up to Hamas to bring this to light, so that all Palestinians
may clearly assess the reality in which they live.</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">U.S. Media Overshadows 50 Years of Palestinian
Dispossession <BR>
With Celebrations of Israel's Anniversary<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Ghada Khouri*</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Identity is something most of us take for granted. But for Palestinians
in America, it is a constant struggle to assert their heritage and history.
As Arabs worldwide remember Al-Nakba, a watershed event that saw the triumph
of the most successful colonialist enterprise of the century, Palestinian
Americans mourn the loss of their homeland largely in silence. Their voices
are muffled by celebrations of Israel's 50th anniversary throughout the
U.S. media.<BR>
On 15 April, CBS, a national television network broadcasting to millions
of households throughout the United States, aired a two-hour grandiose Hollywood
production entitled, &quot;To Life: America Celebrates Israel's 50th Anniversary.&quot;
Guests appearing on the programme included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dustin
Hoffman, Kirk Douglas, Kevin Costner, and a host of renowned celebrities.
The programme even featured a televised appearance by President Bill Clinton,
who described Israel's founders as making &quot;a once barren desert bloom&quot;
and building a &quot;thriving democracy in hostile terrain.&quot;<BR>
By perpetuating the myth that Palestine was a 'land without a people for
a people without a land,' the show obliterated the very existence of the
Palestinian people. The discerning viewer was left to wonder if the Palestinians
did not exist before the creation of Israel, where did they come from, and
why do they continue to resist Israeli occupation?<BR>
Few Americans know the answer to this question, thanks to an elaborate and
effective propaganda waged by Israeli groups and their supporters since
the beginning of the Zionist movement. Israel has poured millions of dollars
into the current campaign dedicated to celebrating its 50th anniversary.<BR>
Established institutions such as the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.,
a hub of artistic and cultural activities, even devoted a three-week programme
to applauding Israel at 50. Israeli consulates around the country sponsored
a host of educational and cultural programmes designed to capture the hearts
and minds of the American public.<BR>
The media have been a fertile ground for the perpetuation of Israeli myths
that negate the Palestinian experience. In many cases, journalists have
fallen prey to the images they grew up with, perpetuating stereotypes and
falsehoods out of ignorance. In other cases, political motives have shaped
their biased coverage.<BR>
For instance, CBS television President Leslie Moonves, who was instrumental
in planning the special dedicated to Israel, is the great nephew of the
first Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. This fact may partly explain
why a major national network would devote two hours of prime time television
to celebrating the birth of another nation.<BR>
Amid the images presented to the American public, Palestinians in America
not only face the pain of remembering their losses as a people, but also
the agony of being ignored and marginalized by the society in which they
live.<BR>
Despite the limited resources at their disposal as a young organized community,
Palestinian and Arab-American groups are telling the story of 50 years of
dispossession, exile and occupation to anyone who will listen. They have
pooled their efforts to build from scratch an embroidered quilt representing
the 418 Palestinian villages razed by Zionist forces during Al-Nakba. Each
panel, embroidered by volunteers throughout the United States, represents
the various Palestinian and Lebanese refugee camps and features the name
of a village and its total population before it was reduced to rubble. The
quilt was unveiled in New York on 15 May and is traveling through various
cities before reaching its final destination. It will be featured in a major
rally in front of the U.S. Capitol on 14 June. In this quilt of dispossession,
Palestinian-Americans have etched their memories of a homeland lost. The
quilt embodies their history, their resilience and their resolve to tell
the other side of the story about the creation of Israel.<BR>
At a time when the United States is at an impasse on how to revive the stalled
peace process, the American media's coverage of Israel's 50th anniversary
and President Clinton's statement describing pre-1948 Palestine as a &quot;barren
desert&quot; will do little to build trust in the United States' professed
role as an honest broker of peace. Even in Israel itself, coverage of the
country's founding in a 12-part documentary series produced by Israeli television
has created a stir of controversy and national debate because of its inclusion
of Palestinian narratives of expulsions, killings and destruction at the
hands of Jewish forces. While the Israeli public was exposed to the Palestinian
experience in this controversial series, Americans remain largely in the
dark about what the Palestinians have endured. This has undoubtedly contributed
to the perpetuation of a U.S. policy that blindly supports Israel. Despite
President Clinton's added pressure on the Netanyahu government owing to
Israel's resistance and rejection of recent U.S. proposals for further withdrawals
from the West Bank, the American President will undoubtedly be remembered
as one of Israel's best friends based on his pro-Israel record to date.<BR>
The pervasiveness of the Israeli version of its 50-year history in the U.S.
media and society should be a lesson for the Arab States to devote greater
attention and resources to a media strategy aimed at presenting the Palestinian
cause to the American public. As Israeli intransigence has become flagrant
with Netanyahu's refusal of the U.S. plan for a 13% pullout from the West
Bank, this is an opportune time to reach out to the American public and
expose Israel's 50-year history of human rights violations, repression and
apartheid-like policies.<BR>
Issues of justice, fairness and peace are central to the American psyche
and public discourse. Educating the American people about the essential
requirements for a just solution to the Palestinian problem must be incorporated
into the Arab States' efforts to enlist U.S. support for a comprehensive
and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. As shapers and moulders
of American public opinion, the U.S. media should be a central target of
an Arab strategy devoted to exposing the crimes committed against the Palestinians.
Conveying the importance of educating the American public is a responsibility
Palestinian-Americans should adopt as a step toward the empowerment of their
brethren in the Palestinian Diaspora and in the Occupied Territories. It
is only when their suffering as an exiled and occupied people is recognized
that real progress can be achieved to build reconciliation and establish
a lasting peace in Israel and Palestine.</P>

<P>On 8 May 1998, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, founder and leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) was supposed to begin a six-day visit to South
Africa. The visit, which would have been in response to an invitation from
no less than 11 local Islamic organizations, did not take place thanks to
the efforts of Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian Authority (PA).
Two PA officials, namely Salman Herfi (the ambassador to South Africa) and
Imad Falogy (the Minister of Communications), had been on a visit to South
Africa for a conference. The latter had, until Yasser Arafat returned to
Gaza as part of the Oslo deal, been a member of Hamas, which he deserted
in exchange for a ministerial post in Arafat's Authority. The interruption
of the South African Muslim community's programme with Sheikh Yassin was
possible when, according to sources in South Africa, Arafat telephoned high-ranking
officials in the South African Foreign Ministry from London--where he had
been attending the failed U.S.-brokered meetings there. It is reported that
Arafat threatened that permitting Sheikh Yassin's visit without the PA's
consent would amount to treason on the part of the ANC, many of whose leaders
are close friends with the PLO. It is ironic that at the same time as these
feverish attempts were being made, Sheikh Yassin was visiting the United
Arab Emirates after having concluded two successful visits to Saudi Arabia
and Qatar. The PA, and for that matter Yasser Arafat, could not utter a
word of protest or demand postponement or cancellation of Sheikh Yassin's
tour of the Arab Gulf countries, which was extended following the cancellation
of his visit to South Africa to include Kuwait on the northern tip of the
Gulf and Yemen in the south of Arabia.<BR>
The excuse given by government sources in South Africa for not authorizing
the issuance of an entry visa for Sheikh Yassin and his accompanying delegation
centred on the claim that it would not be appropriate for the Sheikh to
visit the country prior to a scheduled visit by Arafat next August. The
government's decision has annoyed the Muslim community, which expected the
Zionists in South Africa, and the not the PA, to intervene in the manner
the latter did to prevent the Sheikh's visit. Some Muslims even vowed to
spoil Arafat's visit if it takes place. Whether this happens or not, what
is sure is that Arafat hardly has any friends now among the Muslims of South
Africa.<BR>

<P>Historically it can be shown that a closed society is not interested
in a description of itself, no doubt because any description is in part
a form of critical analysis and so may encourage critical 'forbidden thoughts'.
The more a society becomes open, the more it is interested in reflecting,
at first descriptively and then critically, upon itself, its present working
as well as its past. But what happens when a faction of intellectuals desires
to drag a society, which has already opened up to a considerable extent,
back to its previous totalitarian, closed condition? Then the very means
of the former progress philosophy, the sciences, history and especially
sociology become the most effective instruments of the 'treason of the intellectuals'.
They are perverted in order to serve as devices of deception, and in the
process they degenerate.<BR>
Classical Judaism had little interest in describing or explaining itself
to the members of its own community, whether educated (in talmudic studies)
or not. It is significant that the writing of Jewish history, even in the
driest annalistic style, ceased completely from the time of Josephus Flavius
(end of first century) until the Renaissance, when it was revived for a
short time in Italy and in other countries where the Jews were under strong
Italian influence. Characteristically, the rabbis feared Jewish even more
than general history, and the first modern book on history published in
Hebrew (in the 16th century) was entitled History of the Kings of France
and of the Ottoman Kings. It was followed by some histories dealing only
with the persecutions that Jews had been subjected to. The first book on
Jewish history proper (dealing with ancient times) was promptly banned and
suppressed by the highest rabbinical authorities, and did not reappear before
the 19th century. The rabbinical authorities of east Europe furthermore
decreed that all non-talmudic studies are to be forbidden. even when nothing
specific could be found in them which merits anathema, because they encroach
on the time that should be employed either in studying the Talmud or in
making money - which should be used to subsidise talmudic scholars. Only
one loophole was led, namely the time that even a pious Jew must perforce
spend in the privy. In that unclean place sacred studies are forbidden,
and it was therefore permitted to read history there, provided it was written
in Hebrew and was completely secular, which in effect meant that it must
be exclusively devoted to non-Jewish subjects. (One can imagine that those
few Jews of that time who - no doubt tempted by Satan developed an interest
in the history of the French kings were constantly complaining to their
neighbours about the constipation they were suffering from . . . ) As a
consequence, two hundred years ago the vast majority of Jews were totally
in the dark not only about the existence of America but also about Jewish
history and Jewry's contemporary state; and they were quite content to remain
so.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A Totalitarian History</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P>There was however one area in which they were not allowed to remain self-contented
- the area of Christian attacks against those passages in the Talmud and
the talmudic literature which are specifically anti-Christian or more generally
anti-Gentile. It is important to note that this challenge developed relatively
late in the history of Christian-Jewish relations - only from the 13th century
on. (Before that time, the Christian authorities attacked Judaism using
either Biblical or general arguments, but seemed to be quite ignorant as
to the contents of the Talmud.) The Christian campaign against the Talmud
was apparently brought on by the conversion to Christianity of Jews who
were well versed in the Talmud and who were in many cases attracted by the
development of Christian philosophy, with its strong Aristotelian (and thus
universal) character.<BR>
It must be admitted at the outset that the Talmud and the talmudic literature
- quite apart from the general anti-Gentile streak that runs through them,
contain very offensive statements and precepts directed specifically against
Christianity. For example, in addition to a series of scurrilous sexual
allegations against Jesus, the Talmud states that his punishment in hell
is to he immersed in boiling excrement - a statement not exactly calculated
to endear the Talmud to devout Christians. Or one can quote the precept
according to which Jews are instructed to burn, publicly if possible, any
copy of the New Testament that comes into their hands. (This is not only
still in force but actually practised today; thus on 23 March 1980 hundreds
of copies of the New Testament were publicly and ceremonially burnt in Jerusalem
under the auspices of Yad Le'akhim, a Jewish religious organisation subsidised
by the Israeli Ministry of Religions.)<BR>
Anyway, a powerful attack, well based in many points, against talmudic Judaism
developed in Europe from the 13th century. We are not referring here to
ignorant calumnies, such as the blood libel, propagated by benighted monks
in small provincial cities, but to serious disputations held before the
best European universities of the time and on the whole conducted as fairly
as was possible under medieval circumstances.<BR>
What was the Jewish - or rather the rabbinical - response? The simplest
one was the ancient weapon of bribery and string-pulling. In most European
countries, during most of the time, anything could be fixed by a bribe.
Nowhere was this maxim more true than in the Rome of the Renaissance popes.
The Editio Princeps of the complete Code of Talmudic Law, Maimonides' Mishneh
Torah - replete not only with the most offensive precepts against all Gentiles
but also with explicit attacks on Christianity and on Jesus (after whose
name the author adds piously, 'May the name of the wicked perish') - was
published unexpurgated in Rome in the year 1480) under Sixtus IV, politically
a very active pope who had a constant and urgent need for money. (A few
years earlier, the only older edition of The Golden Ass by Apuleius from
which the violent attack on Christianity had not been removed was also published
in Rome.) Alexander Vl Borgia was also very liberal in this respect.<BR>
Even during that period, as well as before it, there were always countries
in which for a time a wave of anti-Talmud persecution set in. But a more
consistent and widespread onslaught came with the Reformation and Counter
Reformation, which induced a higher standard of intellectual honesty as
well as a better knowledge of Hebrew among Christian scholars. From the
16th century, all the talmudic literature, including the Talmud itself,
was subjected to Christian censorship in various countries. In Russia this
went on until 1917. Some censors, such as in Holland, were more lax, while
others were more severe; and the offensive passages were expunged or modified.<BR>
All modern studies on Judaism. particularly by Jews, have evolved from that
conflict, and to this day they bear the unmistakable marks of their origin:
deception, apologetics or hostile polemics, indifference or even active
hostility to the pursuit of truth. Almost all the so-called Jewish studies
in Judaism, from that time to this very day. are polemics against an external
enemy rather than an internal debate.<BR>
It is important to note that this was initially the character of historiography
in all known societies (except ancient Greece, whose early liberal historians
were attacked by later sophists for their insufficient patriotism!). This
was true of the early Catholic and Protestant historians, who polemicised
against each other. Similarly. the earliest European national histories
are imbued with the crudest nationalism and scorn for all other, neighbouring
nations. But sooner or later there comes a time when an attempt is made
to understand one's national or religious adversary and at the same time
to criticise certain deep and important aspects of the history of one's
own group; and both these developments go together. Only when historiography
becomes - as Pieter Geyl put it so well - la debate without end' rather
than a continuation of war by historiographic means, only then does a humane
historiography, which strives for both accuracy and fairness, become possible;
and it then turns into one of the most powerful instruments of humanism
and self-education.<BR>
It is for this reason that modern totalitarian regimes rewrite history or
punish historians. When a whole society tries to return to totalitarianism,
a totalitarian history is written, not because of compulsion from above
but under pressure from below, which is much more effective. This is what
happened in Jewish history, and this constitutes the first obstacle we have
to surmount.</P>

50 years after the Nakba<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Dr. Daud A. Abdullah*</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Whenever the history of the 20th century is written or revisited by future
generations, two legacies will always be remembered for their disastrous
consequences on world peace and stability. They are the American atomic
bombing of Japan in 1945 and the United Nations implantation of Zionist
Israel in Arab Palestine three years later. Despite their phenomenal human
and material losses, the Palestinians have remained, 50 years after the
Nakba (Catastrophe), undefeated, un-subdued and unyielding. For whether
they are exiled as Stateless refugees abroad or live in their homeland as
alien subjects under Israeli military rule, most Palestinians have remained
absolutely adamant about one thing: the struggle to regain their usurped
rights will continue for as long as it takes. <BR>
Unlike the Zionist settlers, the Palestinians have very few resources and
considerably fewer allies in their quest for self-determination, independence
and Statehood. Lord Balfour, the author of the infamous declaration that
facilitated the conquest of Palestine, underlined this fact when he spelt
out British policy in a memorandum dated 22 September 1919. &quot;In Palestine
we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting its inhabitants
as to their wishes; Zionism is of far greater importance to us than the
desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that land.&quot;
With such undisguised prejudices built into the Mandatory authority, it
was clearly only a matter of time before popular Palestinian discontent
would escalate into fierce political opposition. The armed confrontation
and killing of Sheikh Ezzul Deen Qassam in November 1935 was the final spark
which ignited Palestinian anger and triggered the Great Revolt that lasted
from 1936 to 1939.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>From resistance to exile</FONT></B></P>

<P>There were, of course, other critical factors that provoked Palestinian
indignation. Deprived of all vestiges of self-rule, except in municipal
affairs, their nationalist aspirations were frustrated at every turn by
the ever-growing Anglo-Zionist collaboration. On top of this insult, injury
was doubly added by the inexorable march of other Arabs toward independence.
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, both Britain and France were forced to placate
the Arab nationalist movement. Hence, nominal forms of independence were
granted to Egypt in 1922 and 1936, Transjordan in 1928, Iraq in 1930, Syria
in 1932 and Lebanon in 1936. In Palestine itself, the situation was quite
different. There, the indigenous Arabs were gradually becoming foreigners
in their own land as Jewish immigration and land seizure intensified. Whereas
the Jewish population in Palestine numbered 55,000 in 1919, it dramatically
increased to 160,000 in 1929, and to almost 400,000 by 1937. <BR>
Although the Palestinians managed to liberate and administer about 80% of
their land during the 1936-1939 period, their uprising was eventually crushed
in the latter year by the overwhelming superior firepower of British and
Zionist forces. The poorly armed and ill-trained Palestinians had little
chance against their adversaries. In a massive show of disproportionate
force, Britain had by late 1938 amassed over 20,000 ground troops in Palestine.
They were, in addition, aided by the indiscriminate use of Royal Air Force
planes. After placing the entire population under Emergency Military Administration,
the authorities imprisoned and detained without trial an estimated 5,600
Arabs in 1938. Using the same Emergency laws, they sent another 200 Palestinians
into exile and hung 54 others that same year. Though illegal under the Geneva
Convention regarding the conduct of war, these same provisions also provided
for the collective punishment of civilians and confiscation of property.
As a result, hundreds of Palestinian homes, orchards and vineyards were
destroyed while the livestock of entire villages were confiscated or slaughtered.
When the Revolt was finally suppressed in March 1939, Walid Khalidi recorded
that over 5,000 Palestinians were killed and 14,000 wounded.<BR>
For all their worth, none of the above statistics can, by themselves, explain
the process by which the Palestinians were dispossessed and turned into
a minority community in their own land. In the same manner, Chaim Weizmann's
claim that it was &quot;a miraculous clearing of the land&quot; was, for
all intents and purposes, a futile attempt to over-simplify the facts. Far
from being a supernatural occurrence, the Zionist conquest of Palestine
was actually the implementation of a plan for the organized seizure of Arab
land even before the creation of Israel. The Jewish Agency's economic and
agricultural expert, Dr. A. Ruppin, was probably much more in tune with
reality when he wrote in 1930 that &quot;Land is the most necessary thing
for settling in Palestine. As in Palestine there is almost no more arable
and unoccupied land, we must, in every case when we purchase land and settle
it, remove the peasants who until now have cultivated it, whether they be
the proprietors of the land or tenants.&quot; The ruthless enactment of
this policy has consequently seen the illegal &quot;land ownership&quot;
by Zionists grow from 2.5% in 1917 to 6.5% in 1947 and 93% in 1982. Thus,
whereas it took the Europeans centuries to dispossess the indigenous peoples
of America, Australia and New Zealand, it took the Zionists only a few decades
to do the same with the Palestinians. <BR>
Despite the intense suffering caused by their loss of land and dispersal,
the Palestinians have been generally portrayed to the world as villains
of peace. Yet, the record of Zionist terrorism, though always hidden from
public scrutiny, can be traced back to the period of the British Mandate.
In their campaign to bring about a total lifting of immigration restrictions
into Palestine, Zionist assassins murdered the British Minister Resident
in Cairo, Lord Moyne, in November 1944. Two years later, they bombed the
King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing scores of British and Arab residents.
Thereafter, in 1947, they dispatched a series of letter bombs to British
Cabinet Ministers. Surely, if these represented a mere fraction of Zionist
atrocities against their friends and benefactors, one is left with no doubts
about the crimes committed against the Palestinians, whom the Zionists have
always considered less than human. Golda Meier's claim that &quot;There
is no such thing as Palestinians&quot; has, therefore, not only been a symbol
of Israel's dehumanization of its hapless victims but also of the racism
that has constantly been a hallmark of its society. Hence, even the over-indulgent
United Nations General Assembly was forced to denounce Zionism as a form
of racism in November 1975.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Celebrating failure</FONT></B><BR>
From its very inception, the colonial project in Palestine was doomed to
failure. Although its founding fathers had promised to be standard bearers
of European civilization and technology in the &quot;decaying&quot; Arab
lands, they have remained throughout the past 50 years entirely dependent
upon Western aid. Instead of becoming a worthwhile strategic ally in the
region, Israel has been an inordinate burden for Europe and the United States
especially, which, since 1948, has supplied over $28 billion in aid equally
divided between loans and gifts, two thirds of which were for military purposes.
Under the current Clinton administration the upward trend of US treasury
and technological transfers has continued unremittingly. Albeit in the wake
of widespread allegations that Israel has been illegally selling the same
technology to third countries, thereby denying profits and jobs to American
taxpayers.<BR>
Amid the lingering suspicions concerning Israeli handling of secret US technology,
several voices have emerged from within the establishment calling for a
general overhaul of policy toward the Middle East. Foremost among those
who view Israel as nothing but expensive excess baggage are Anthony Cordesman,
a one-time State Department and Pentagon defense specialist; George Ball,
the former Under-Secretary of State; and Harry Shaw, also a former head
of the military assistance branch of the Officof Management and Budget.
The last wrote that &quot;Exaggerated claims of Israel's capabilities and
willingness to act as a strategic surrogate for America in the Middle East...confuse
and distort the differences in the two countries' interests, responsibilities
and capabilities and hamper America's efforts to protect its interests when
Israeli actions threaten them.&quot; <BR>
Even with its lavish American aid and nuclear arsenal, there is still no
other country in the world today where Jews enjoy less safety than in Israel.
The failure of its leaders to guarantee the safety of its citizens has been,
to a large extent, a direct result of their failure to restore Palestinian
rights. In view of this chronic security problem, only 18% of the world's
Jews have chosen to live in Israel. Be that as it may, the Zionist project
in Palestine has likewise failed in other notable respects. Although it
was intended to be an exclusive Jewish commonwealth, there are still 953,497
Palestinians residing in Israel. The succession of wars, massacres, expulsions
and apartheid policies have, altogether, failed to &quot;spirit them across
the border&quot;, as Herzl had planned when he wrote in his diary on 12
June 1895. Hence, by constituting roughly 25% of the country's population,
these Arabs remain a constant threat and reminder to the Zionists that Palestine
was indeed &quot;a land with a people.&quot;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Preserving the national identity</FONT></B><BR>
Not satisfied with the 56.4% area of Palestine allotted to them by the United
Nations, the Zionists seized, by force of arms, an additional 21% of the
territory before announcing their State in May 1948. Except that, even after
so doing, Israel has refused after 50 years to define its geographic boundaries.
Indeed, it went on later to occupy the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip.
After being &quot;occupied territories&quot; at the time of its capture
in 1967, the West Bank has since been acclaimed by the Israelis as &quot;administered
territories&quot;, &quot;the territories&quot; and now &quot;Judea and Samaria.&quot;
While exposing the weaknesses and contradictions of Israeli society, the
West Bank and Gaza have nevertheless become the home of Palestinian resistance.
As Jordan had been prior to 1970 and Lebanon was during that decade, the
West Bank and Gaza Strip have now become the natural preserve of Palestinian
nationalism. The courageous sacrifices of the stone-throwing generation
during the 1987-1993 Intifadah was, therefore, not simply an explosion of
popular anger but more significantly a massive assertion of Palestinian
national identity. <BR>
As Israel conducts its 50th anniversary celebrations, religious extremists
there will, naturally, try to cover-up the inherent dangers of occupying
the West Bank and Gaza; even though some of their pioneering politicians
have long cautioned of its perils. The country's first foreign minister,
Moshe Sharett, had forewarned that what was achieved in 1948 could not be
repeated elsewhere at any time. As for the West Bank and Gaza, he told Ben
Gurion their occupation will not resolve any security problem, &quot;as
the refugees...will continue to constitute the same trouble, and even more
so, as their hate will be rekindled...by the atrocities that we shall cause
them to suffer during the occupation.&quot; The continuing importance of
Sharett's advice confirms in a very curious way that despite their elaborate
claims and pretenses, Israeli leaders have learned precious little from
their recent history. For after 50 years of dispossession, dispersal and
deprivation, the Palestinians have remained as indomitable as ever in their
resistance to Zionist colonialism.</P>

(2-2)</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>A very strange and bizarre conclusion evolves from the Zionist claim.
It renders Christ's first coming as a mission of futility and total failure!
God the Father has sent His only son for the redemption of HIS people, but
His people rejected Him and He ended up preaching to the gentiles. If the
Jews did accept HIM, we would not have had to face all the Arab-Israeli
conflicts, wars, bloodshed and refugees! Because there would be no Israel
since all the Jews would have converted to Christians by their mere acceptance
of Christ! Are they to be &quot;rewarded&quot; by giving them Palestine
because they rejected Christ? While hundreds of thousands of Palestinian
Christians, who had originated from the early Biblical Jews and converted
into Christianity by accepting Christ, are to be &quot;punished &quot; now
by being evicted from Palestine and not allowed to return! If I were a Jew,
I would have no problems according to the Israeli Law of Return, which encourages
Jews to immigrate to Palestine! Is God punishing all these Palestinian Christians
for accepting Christ? That sounds so na&iuml;ve when one realizes that the
Palestinians are His creations too and He is all Mercy. Such courageous
similar views were voiced by the Rev. Francis Sayre, the dean of National
Cathedral in Washington, when Israel took total control of Jerusalem in
1972 and committed so many human rights violations against the Arab inhabitants
of the city. He declared that the oppressed are becoming the new oppressors
as Arabs are being deported, imprisoned without any charge and their human
rights are violated. Similar criticism of Israel has been also voiced by
others such as Dr. Edward Elson, pastor of the National Presbyterian Church
and chaplain of the U.S. Senate when he debunked the views of those who
claim that Israel's occupation of the Holy City is a fulfillment of the
Bible! As years passed by and as events developed in the Middle East, more
of the Palestinian suffering was exposed in the media and more church leaders
voiced their support for the rights of the Palestinians, but for a price.
They had to be attacked in the media for daring to voice their honest opinions.
On 21 December 1992, the following paid advertisement by Churches for Middle
East Peace appeared in the New York Times: &quot;As Christians committed
to working for peace, we support a negotiated solution for Jerusalem that
respects the human and political rights of both Palestinians and Israelis,
as well as the rights of the three religious communities. We urge Jews,
Christians and Muslims to open dialogue on those issues.&quot; Can anybody
spot anything wrong with the above advertisement calling for peaceful co-existence
among the three religions and advocating the political rights of all people
in Jerusalem? I cannot, in all honesty, criticize but rather commend those
behind any advertisement that promotes peace. Believe it or not, all hell
broke loose over the above ad. According to the Washington Jewish Week of
2 January 1993, the above was &quot;nothing more than blunt &#133;biased
and hypocritical&quot;, and the writers &quot;should be silent now - if
they won't speak up for continued Israeli control.&quot; While The Jewish
Week serving the tri-State region in its 3 January 1993 edition called the
ad &quot;mischievous.&quot; Similar attacks were carried out by over 50
Jewish organizations on the national level. What the Jewish propaganda machine
did not know was that the coalition that placed the ad represented all different
Churches of Christian America; it was not simply a pro-justice group in
Jerusalem. What happened to the First Amendment and freedom of speech? Well,
Christian Americans do not know it, but the First Amendment applies only
when Israel is not criticized! If the Biblical claims are left to Zionist
interpretations, then I honestly believe Christianity should cease to exist
and we should simply close all of our churches and join the Jewish synagogues!
<BR>
Of course all the Biblical claims discussed above hold no legal ground in
any court of law anywhere on the planet earth. You just cannot walk into
a court and make claims to real estate anywhere by telling them you are
the seed of Abraham! If such Biblical and historical claims are accepted
by the rest of the world today, the entire map of our planet earth has to
be drastically changed. The Greeks can claim Egypt and Syria, the Italians
can claim North Africa and the Middle East and they would have to fight
over it with the Turks, who also occupied the Middle East for over 400 years.
The Arabs, using Zionist logic, should have no opposition if they were to
claim Palestine since they inhabited Palestine for over 1,300 years, which
is more than twice the period of the entire Jewish history in the same area.
They can also claim Spain and south of France and so on!<BR>
The Zionists' claim that we Palestinians were not there for 3,000 years
but rather came to Palestine with the Muslim invasion in the seventh century
is totally false. When the Muslims arrived, they treated the people of Palestine
with utmost respect according to all history records. This meant that the
Muslims did not invade an empty country but rather it was fully inhabited
with Christians and people of other beliefs! One would logically ask where
did the original Christian population come from? They could not have come
with the Muslim invasion because they were simply not Muslims! According
to this historical fact, one should remember great Muslim leaders such as
Caliph Omar Ibn El-Khattab, who refused to pray in the Holy Sepulchre as
a matter of total respect to the Christians, because, as he explained it,
had he prayed in such a spot, future Muslims would demand the right to build
a Mosque on the spot where he prayed and that would have created a future
conflict between the Muslims and the Christians!<BR>
To keep this analysis open-ended, let us accept for the sake of discussion
that the Zionist claim is correct. Let us assume that when the Arabs came
to Palestine it was totally &quot;empty.&quot; So the Palestinians had been
in Palestine around 1,400 years only! While the Jews never showed up since
they were taken into captivity around 70 CE (Common Era), i.e. they were
absent from Palestine for over 2,000 years! Now they would claim that the
Palestinians had lost their rights in Palestine because they stayed in the
country for only 1,400 years! If we are to question the Zionists who evicted
the Palestinians out of Palestine about the nature of the role of these
inhabitants staying for &quot;only&quot; 1,400 years, what response should
we expect from them? Were they tenants of the country or managers or what?
How did they lose their rights to their country after 1,400 years? Would
they retort by telling them: Thank you for taking care of our land for 1,400
years and now you have to leave? Under what legal or moral criterion could
such chutzpah take place? I think they never heard of the U.S. immigration
laws under which you could become a citizen after five years of continuous
residency! Nor did they hear of international laws that prohibit such fallacies.
Even the Ottoman Empire laws and the British mandate gives one the right
for a land which one cultivated for only 10 consecutive years.<BR>
Even after all these years, have they thought of coming to our country and
living with us as equals? Did they have to uproot us and turn us into tragic
refugees? Did all the tragedies originate from God, or were the Zionists
behind it? Was it God who inspired Menachem Begin to commit one of the most
heinous massacres of the war at Deir Yassin? Why would God create these
people if He wanted them butchered? The thought of blaming the loving God
for what Zionists did borders on na&iuml;vet&eacute;. Do not kill and do
not steal, God ordered the Jews in the Ten Commandments. Did God simply
change his mind? The Zionists take special delights in having some of the
evangelical church leaders propagate the myths of the prophecies because
it will secure a large audience on the pro-Israel side. Meanwhile, they
do not believe in evangelism and orthodox Jews made more than one complaint
about the evangelical missionaries in Israel. But to choose the lessoof
two evils, they tend to go along with them as long as the American audience
is swayed in the direction of Israel. To make a few church leaders happy
would secure for Israel 40 million-60 million American voters, who in turn
can pressure their representatives to approve all kinds of aid to the Jewish
State. Some of these evangelists are so entrenched in their pro-Israel positions
that nothing would alter that even if the truth stares them in the eye.
I remember trying to persuade a certain clergymen on the Biblical myths,
only to receive a blunt response requesting that I do not communicate with
him. He did not even want to discuss it. In their eyes, Israel is above
reproach because the events are all part of God's plan. The massacres, the
killings, the bloodshed, the evictions, the stealing of someone's land and
homes are all part of God's &quot;plan&quot;! I am sure God has the means
and the power to use more humane methods to actuate His plans if they were
His plans! The problem with evangelists is that they do not refer to the
Bible or the New Testament to judge Israeli actions, but simply take it
for granted that whatever Israel does, then that is God's Plan! My god!
How blind can these people be to accept so much evil in the name of God?
A bit of irony is exposed when the Zionist leadership extracted from our
Pope a statement in which the church confirms that the Jews nowadays should
not be held responsible for what their biblical fathers did to Christ. But
the claim to re-take what their biblical fathers owned remains valid! I
am quite sure that such a chutzpah is nothing more than a double standard!<BR>

<P>An ex-member of Ennahda and a former staunch defender and close associate
of Rashid Ghannoushi, Mohammed Elhachmi Hamdi has recently joined the club
of Ghannoushi 'discreditors'. His critique appears primarily in his Ph.D.
dissertation at the School of Oriental and African Studies, the University
of London. His research, which started in 1990, two years before he decided
to leave the movement, was expected by Ghannoushi and other Ennahda members
to be the first academic work in English to vindicate Ennahda and provide
an objective analysis of its history and convictions.<BR>
However, it turned out to be, from Ennahda's point of view, worse than anything
they feared the most hostile of their critics would say about them. Hamdi,
who had until the early 1990s been well-positioned and especially favoured
by Ghannoushi, was growing restless as he saw his role as spokesperson for
the movement diminish. He had previously been asked to represent Ennahda
abroad and to establish links, which he successfully achieved, with the
media and political circles in Europe and in the Arab world. But Ghannoushi
left Tunisia, settled in London, and was in a position to speak for the
movement himself. Scores of senior Ennahda members joined Ghannoushi in
his London exile or settled elsewhere in Europe. The movement started reorganizing
itself and restructuring its offices, apparently minimizing the role previously
assigned to Hamdi. The straw that broke the camel's back and convinced Hamdi
that he had no reason to remain in the movement was, however, his loss of
a bid to be appointed as chief editor of a newspaper the movement was contemplating
publishing in London. In May 1992, Hamdi announced his withdrawal from the
movement in the London Arabic press. In his press statement, he explained
that he resigned because of disagreement over the priorities of Islamic
and national work in the current period and over the methodology pursued
by the movement.<BR>
Hamdi expressed confidence that the Islamic work in Tunisia was in need
of serious and fundamental revisions regarding the vital issues that constitute
its general strategy. In a remark interpreted by Ennahda as an attempt on
the part of Hamdi to distance himself from whatever the regime in Tunisia
accused Ennahda of, he denounced violence, stressing that &quot;no party
will benefit from embroilment in violent conflict because no one, except
the enemy, wins a battle waged against one's own brother and fellow citizens.&quot;<BR>
This development necessitated a change in the purpose of Hamdi's Ph.D. thesis,
which was to retaliate against the movement that denied him the opportunity
to accomplish his aspired dream of one day becoming its leader. He set out
to prove to his adversaries within the movement that he was capable not
only of succeeding on his own, but also of damaging the movement by discrediting
its leader, the very same person who always lent him a helping hand and
promoted him in the face of strong opposition from other leading members
who felt uncomfortable working with Hamdi. To many of them, he was an opportunist
that was more interested in self-serving manoeuvres rather than in safeguarding
the interests of the movement.<BR>
Entitled, &quot;An Analysis of the History and Discourse of the Tunisian
Islamic Movement al-Nahda--A Case Study of the Politicization of Islam&quot;,
Hamdi's Ph.D. is not as damaging as he might have wished it to be. The conclusions
he draws are no different than the claims already made by government-sponsored
and Arab secularist critics of Ghannoushi. All he could come up with were
charges of &quot;double-talk and double-agenda&quot; and of embroilment
in violence. This is not what is astonishing about Hamdi's findings. What
is striking is that, despite having been active within the ranks of the
Tunisian Islamic movement since 1978, Hamdi managed, rather swiftly, to
change his convictions, not only about Ghannoushi and Ennahda but also about
the entire concept of Islamic activism. In this regard, his discourse is
indistinguishable from that of American Zionist lobbyists such as Judith
Miller and Daniel Pipes or from that of anti-Islamism Arab secularists such
as Bahey Eddin Hassan and Haydar Ibrahim or from the official policies of
some of the most authoritarian governments in the Arab world such as Tunisia.
Like them, Hamdi now assumes that Islam as a religion is non-political;
he regards Islamic movements, including Ennahda, to be opportunistic political
groups that use Islam to serve their ends and to conceal hidden agendas
of planning to seize power through violence.<BR>
What is even more striking is that Hamdi remains throughout his dissertation
a silent witness. He does not inform us of his own experience, of his own
findings or of his own assessment of what others--on whose writings he mainly
relies--say about Ennahda or Ghannoushi. The issues he raises in his dissertation
and uses as indicators of how disastrous Ghannoushi's leadership of Ennahda
has been are the very same ones he strongly defended and skilfully explained
just before he started having disagreements with Ghannoushi over the post
of chief editor. In his introduction to the first volume of a collection
of Ghannoushi's writings, published just before he withdrew from the movement
in 1992, Hamdi sought to highlight what he called the features of excellence
in Ghannoushi's thoughts and in the Islamic Tunisian experiment. Contrary
to the way he depicts him in his Ph.D. thesis, Hamdi describes Ghannoushi
as one of the greatest Islamic thinkers of our time. Ghannoushi is hailed
as a great leader whose struggle along several fronts never ceased--a defender
of human rights, women's rights and workers' rights, a strict adherent to
Shura, and a leader respectful of his colleagues and insistent on assessment
and self-critique. Hamdi concludes his introduction to the book by presenting
Ghannoushi as one of the symbols of the new epoch.<BR>
No less devout is Hamdi's emphasis of the distinctiveness of Ghannoushi
in his own documentation of the history of Ennahda in a book published in
1989. Nowhere in this book or in any of the literature Hamdi produced before
his desertion is he seen to criticize Ghannoushi or the movement, or even
demand revision or reform. <BR>
In contrast, Hamdi now shows no hesitation in claiming the exact opposite.
Having read Hamdi's dissertation, this researcher finds his thesis to include
serious faults in no less than 75 positions. In a bid to discredit Ghannoushi,
both as a thinker and a leader, Hamdi resorted to excluding important historical
facts, to disregarding important texts, to distorting some of Ghannoushi's
statements, to relying on police reports based on confessions extracted
under duress and to relying on forged political statements attributed to
Ghannoushi but strongly denied by him.<BR>
As to the exclusion of historical facts, Hamdi falls totally silent with
regard to the influence of Bennabi on Ghannoushi and on the movement as
a whole. The trips made by the founders of the movement for three years
to Algeria to meet and listen to Bennabi, and Bennabi's treatise on democracy
translated by Ghannoushi in prison are non-existent in the dissertation.
What Hamdi sets out to prove is that Ennahda has been influenced by three
main factors: the Tabligh, to give an impression of radicalism in appearance;
the Ikhwan (Brotherhood, and Sayyid Qutb in particular), to give an impression
of radicalism in thinking; and Iran, to give an impression of radicalism
in methodology. <BR>
Although the subject of his Ph.D. thesis is the politicization of religion,
Hamdi provides no definition of politicization and leaves it to the reader
to conclude that it means using religion as a motivation and justification
of the desire to seize power. Nor does he say what he understands Islam
to mean, although it become apparent that his concept of Islam has now become
a secularist concept of religion. <BR>
Hamdi reduces the imprisonment period of Ghannoushi and several of his colleagues
in the early 1980s to a period marred by dispute. Ennahda members accuse
Hamdi of deliberately maintaining silence in his dissertation regarding
significant activities that took place within the prison. The most important
of these was the drafting of a comprehensive assessment of Tunisian society
that the movement felt was necessary prior to proposing its own Islamic
alternative. The importance of this draft assessment is that it belies some
of Hamdi's allegations, including the claim that Ghannoushi had no interest
in the Arab reformist school of the nineteenth century or in Khair-ud-Din
At-Tunisi and the claim that there were no attempts to formulate a political
or social theory because the leaders of the movement only reacted to events
around them.<BR>
Hamdi relies exclusively on sources known to have been staunchly opposed
to the Islamic movement, and at the same time closely tied to the regime,
to indict the leadership of the movement for setting up a secret military
wing about which most members had no knowledge. He himself, as a member,
apparently was unaware of the existence of this wing. <BR>
Hamdi's ex-colleagues in Ennahda find it only reasonable to conclude that
the change in his position is motivated primarily by a feeling of profound
bitterness toward the movement he decided to renounce because of a dispute
over his role within its newly structured organization. Such bitterness
has driven him to distort statements made by Ghannoushi so as to discredit
him and to portray him in the image of an exclusionist who looks down upon
others. Ghannoushi is accused of attempting to rewrite history and misrepresent
the present. <BR>
There are several other examples of such distortion in Hamdi's Ph.D. thesis.
One particularly flagrant distortion is seen in the way he plays with a
text of an interview conducted with Ghannoushi by Qusay Ad-Darwish on the
concept of Muslim and Islamist. The twisting, omitting and out-of-context
quoting is aimed at proving that Ghannoushi believes that his movement is
the sole representative of the faith. In fact, nowhere in Ghannoushi's writings
or statements is he found to claim, implicitly or explicitly, what Hamdi
attributes to him.<BR>
To prove his point that Ghannoushi is not sincere about his claim to democracy,
Hamdi relies heavily on two evidences, both of which were obtained from
the files of the Tunisian government and both of which are vehemently denied
by Ennahda and Ghannoushi. The first is the claim that Ennahda had a military
wing that was preparing to seize power. The second is a fabricated document
in which Ghannoushi supposedly praises Saddam Hussein's wise and courageous
leadership and declares that the man who dared to attack Israel and resist
in the face of united international aggression deserves to give orders and
to be obeyed by Muslims and to have the right to money and lives. This is
the same document that was used to prove its allegation that Ghannoushi
was a terrorist by The Sunday Telegraph's lawyers in the London case he
brought against the newspaper. Denying any connection with the document,
which strangely appears nowhere in any published Islamic book or periodical,
but not denying his opposition to the U.S.-led alliance against Iraq, Ghannoushi
insists that this document was fabricated by the regime in Tunisia in an
attempt to discredit him.<BR>
The list of errors and misrepresentations in Hamdi's work is rather long
and would require the writing of a sizeable book to rebut them all. Ennahda
members have another explanation as to why Hamdi could not, after having
resigned from the movement, remain in peace with his former colleagues.
For them, he is a man of ambitions; it would not have been possible for
him to accomplish any of his ambitions without funds. To deserve the support
and funding of his current sponsors, suspected by Ennahda members to be
associated with some Arab governments, Hamdi felt it was not sufficient
to dissociate himself from Ennahda and Ghannoushi, but also to dissociate
himself from what he calls the politicization of Islam, something he never
questioned before he left the movement. That is why he is keen on describing
himself now as a 'former Islamist'.</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Why Clinton came to the Arab American
Leadership Conference <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Dr. James J. Zogby*</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>On 7 May 1998, President Bill Clinton addressed the Arab American Leadership
Conference in Washington, D.C. It was the first time a U.S. president had
addressed an Arab American conference. For my institute (the Arab American
Institute), the other co-sponsoring organizations, the more than 800 Arab
Americans in attendance and the hundreds of thousands who watched the event
live on C-SPAN and ANA-TV, it was a remarkable and historic moment. Although
some critics may not have understood the significance of the event, for
those of us who laboured long and hard in Arab American politics, its meaning
was undeniable. Our community had arrived. As an organized constituency,
Arab Americans are now recognized as full participants in the U.S. political
system. This was not always so. It did not come easy. We had earned this
recognition with a lot of hard work.<BR>
Just 30 years ago there was not an Arab American community to speak of.
There were no national Arab American organizations, and there was no unified
community consciousness. There were some organizations, but they were mainly
social Lebanese groupings or village and family-based associations. Individuals
of Arab descent could and did become involved in U.S. politics but as individuals,
without an ethnic (and certainly not an &quot;Arab&quot;) identification.
When Arab American organizations did come into existence, they experienced
two somewhat related difficulties. Because they largely based themselves
on Arab issues, they did not attract to their membership the overwhelming
majority of Americans of Arab descent. Additionally, they did not direct
their attention or participate in the major arena of American politics-electoral
activity.<BR>
Nevertheless, these groups were vigorously attacked by the much larger and
more powerful American Jewish organizations that saw Arab Americans as a
potential threat. Because these Arab American groups were on the margin
of U.S. politics, they were vulnerable to these attacks. During the past
20 years there has been a steady evolution of Arab American organizing efforts
to move from the margins of U.S. politics into the mainstream. But it was
not an easy task.<BR>
When, in this early period, Arab American organizations attempted to join
broader U.S. coalitions on foreign policy or civil rights concerns, they
were often excluded because of American Jewish pressure. I recall attempting
to bring an organization I formed in 1978 into the Washington-based Coalition
for a New Foreign Policy. The members of the Coalition voted overwhelmingly
to include us. But we were ultimately rejected when three Jewish groups
threatened to resign in protest if we were admitted. That same year, we
were invited to join a coalition that was being formed by several U.S. ethnic
organizations. Once again, our inclusion was challenged by Jewish groups,
who ended up forming the coalition without us.<BR>
Around that same time I was invited to the White House to an ethnic leadership
meeting with Vice-President Walter Mondale. Three days after the meeting,
a White House official called to inform me that I would not be invited back
again because Jewish groups had complained that a &quot;pro-Arab&quot; group
had been included. During this period, major Jewish groups published reports
and issued warnings to the media and politicians on each and every Arab
American organization and leader. We were described as &quot;terrorist supporters&quot;
and/or anti-Semites. Because some of these politicians and even some in
the media took those warnings seriously, we found our path to full inclusion
impeded. These same Jewish groups even published analyses of the &quot;Arab
American phenomenon.&quot; They denied the existence of an Arab American
community as such and dismissed it as fiction created simply to wage an
anti-Israel campaign. Although some progress was made during this period,
grave difficulties remained.<BR>
Beginning in 1984, however, with Arab American involvement in both the Jesse
Jackson presidential campaign and the Republican presidential campaign of
Ronald Reagan, things began to change for Arab Americans. Our AAI was founded
in 1984 by Arab American Democrats and Republicans in order to further the
process began in 1984 of bringing Arab Americans into mainstream U.S. politics.
At first our efforts, while recording some successes, encountered serious
challenges as well. Pressure continued to be applied to candidates to reject
Arab American support and to exclude Arab Americans from political campaigns.
For two years, for example, the Democratic Party refused to meet with or
recognize the newly formed Arab American Democratic Federation. It was clear
that as we sought to enter the mainstream, we would be perceived as even
more threatening, and the pressure to exclude us would intensify. But as
Jesse Jackson reminded us in these early years, &quot;The biggest threat
you pose is not the threat to quit and walk away, but the threat to stay
around and fight.&quot; And fight we did.<BR>
In 1986, AAI published a booklet called the &quot;Politics of Exclusion.&quot;
In this study we detailed how the campaigns of several politicians discriminated
against Arab Americans: by rejecting our contributions, refusing our endorsements
and attacking their opponents because Arab Americans were participating
in or contributing to their campaigns. This booklet received significant
press coverage. And in the years that followed, each and every time candidates
treated our community in an undemocratic way, we protested publicly and
received both press coverage and public support.<BR>
In the 1988 presidential campaign, Arab Americans made a real impact on
both parties. We elected a record number of delegates in national and State
party conventions. On the Democratic side, we succeeded in winning enough
seats and supporters that in 10 State conventions we passed resolutions
supporting Palestinian Statehood and had the first-ever debate on Palestinian
rights at the National Democratic Convention in Atlanta. The nation's press
was filled with articles about &quot;Arab Americans Coming of Age in U.S.
Politics&quot; and some even attributed Jesse Jackson's victory in the Michigan
primary elections, in part, to the Arab American vote. We continued to grow
and develop: increasing Arab American voter registration, candidate-support
activity, and deepening Arab American involvement in the grass roots of
both parties.<BR>
The phenomenon had become self-generating. Arab Americans across the country
had begun quite spontaneously to organize and vote and became recognized.
And the growth has continued. After initially experiencing some difficulty
breaking into the Clinton campaign in 1992, Arab Americans fought back and
gained access to the campaign. Arab Americans supported the campaign and
were, in turn, supported in their efforts by the campaign. In many ways
the Clinton White House has been extremely supportive of Arab American involvement.<BR>
While Arab American involvement at the 1993 White House signing ceremony
and Vice President Gore's Builders for Peace are well known, as are the
frequent Arab American White House and State Department meetings, other
developments are less well known. When the White House and Democratic Party
founded their ethnic councils, Arab Americans were not only included from
the outset, we were also asked to serve as one of the three co-conveners
of the groups. In addition, Arab Americans participated in the President's
Initiative on Race and the White House Conference on Hate Crimes. Arab Americans
were also a part of the Democratic Party's mobilizing efforts on behalf
of several of the President's important legislative initiatives: the budget
proposal, health care reform and education reform. In 1996, Arab American
involvement in the national electoral arena took a step forward when the
Clinton-Gore presidential campaign formally launched, at a Washington press
conference, the Arab Americans for Clinton-Gore Committee. In 1997, this
Committee was transformed into the Arab American Democratic Leadership Council
(AADLC), a recognized part of the Democratic Party. Through all of this,
Arab Ameractivity in the political process continued to grow. Today, the
Arab American vote in Michigan, for example, is a recognized political force.
Across the United States, Arab Americans are running for office and winning
elections in record numbers. There are currently six Arab American members
of Congress and one Arab American Senator.<BR>
This year a total of 14 Arab Americans are running for Congressional and
Senate seats! In addition to the AADLC, there is an Arab American Republican
group and an Arab American Leadership Council that now includes almost 400
Arab American elected officials and party leaders. This number includes
dozens of mayors, judges, State representatives and county party chairs.
Our most important accomplishment, I believe, is that we have fused together
most of the component parts of the Arab American community into a single
constituency. We are, as I said in my 7 May introduction to the President's
speech, immigrants and descendants of immigrants...we are a diverse people,
about 3 million strong, coming from all parts of the Arab World. We are
part of the American success story. No longer does an individual of Arab
descent who seeks to run for office run away from the Arab American community.
The community supports those candidates, and the candidates seek community
support. We have formed a mutually beneficial relationship, which has given
us strength and recognition. Other politicians now seek us out as well.
Today, in most campaigns, Arab American support is sought and welcomed.
As the Arab American vote numbers increased and Arab Americans have become
more active in politics, politicians who only a decade ago rejected our
support now reach out for our endorsements. As one White House official
described this turnabout, &quot;Politicians know how to count and now you
count.&quot;<BR>
I recall an event in the middle of Israel's 1996 bombing campaign in Lebanon
that made it clear to me how far we had developed. As always happens in
the middle of a crisis situation, the White House Office of Public Liaison
called my office to see how the community was reacting to the bombing and
what could be done to assist us. The National Security Council also called
and organized a few meetings for our leadership with White House and State
Department officials. The most intriguing call, however, came from a high-level
White House political official who asked, &quot;Will this hurt us in Michigan?&quot;
The intent of his call was purely political. He wanted to know if the White
House would lose Arab American voters in Michigan in the November 1996 elections?
While some might dismiss the call as crass politics-in fact, politics is
a crass game of numbers-this was the call Arab Americans had been working
toward for 20 years! After working to register voters and organize their
turnout, now, for the first time, politicians were taking note of the Arab
American vote in a key State that had to be won in order to win the White
House. Inspired by that call, we worked with Michigan's large organized
Lebanese community. They brought almost 3,000 Arab Americans to Washington
to demonstrate their concern for Lebanon in front of the White House. Before
the demonstration, the President's National Security Adviser met with us,
and the President agreed to four of the demands we made that day. Our message
had been sent, and we were heard.<BR>
When some Arab reporters asked us how we got the President to come to our
event, they expected, I believe, a short answer or some behind-the-scenes
story of intrigue. Instead, I gave them the narrative I have just related
of our 20 years of struggle. The President came, in part, because we had
earned his recognition and respect, because we had worked hard and made
our place in U.S. politics. Additionally, we have developed personal ties
with White House officials and party leaders. The importance of these bonds
of friendship can never be underestimated. It's like the lesson I learned
from my father's grocery store. Customers will come to your business if
you have the goods they want and if they like doing business with you. You
have to have both the goods to sell and a personal relationship.<BR>
There are still huge challenges facing Arab Americans. The negative stereotypes
our opponents created to discredit the Arab cause have now become public
policy. FBI harassment, airport profiling and other forms of discrimination
are issues that must be addressed in addition to the ongoing struggle for
a balanced Middle East policy. But the path to overcoming all these problems
is the same path we have been following for the past two decades. A recent
caller to my ANA radio programme criticized our Vote '98 Conference, saying
that he attended only one session and left because, as he put it, &quot;you
were not discussing the important issues facing the Arab World. You were
only talking about voting and elections.&quot; My response was simply &quot;voting
and participation in politics is the most important issue, because none
of our other issues will be addressed until we are stronger as an American
voting constituency. There is no shortcut. It is the only way for us to
succeed.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;The New Lebanon, Where to?&quot;<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Ghazi Assali*</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>On 13 April, the twenty-third anniversary of the Lebanese civil war was
remembered. It was a 15-year tragedy of death and destruction that ravaged
the country and left in its wake hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded
and more than a million emigrants. Without getting into a lengthy discussion
of the causes, I merely would like to point out that the war ended in 1990
with the re-establishment of a central government authority over all Lebanese
territory, with the exception of the area occupied in the south by &quot;Israel&quot;.<BR>
Since the end of the war and the signing of the Taif Agreement in Saudi
Arabia that set the stage for more equitable power sharing between Christians
and Muslims, reconstruction projects have been steadily under way. Solidere,
the company that monopolizes the rebuilding of the destroyed downtown area,
happens to be owned by the billionaire Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, and
happens to be buying every other piece of prime property in Lebanon as well.
Thus, sooner or later, Lebanon will become a sort of &quot;Hariri-land&quot;,
where the power of an extreme and greedy form of modern-day feudalism of
a few well-connected politician-businessmen is impoverishing the already
poor 80% to 90% of the Lebanese people. Strikes and demonstrations against
the skyrocketing cost of living are illegal, and the government interferes
even in labour union elections, forcing their candidates in.<BR>
The country's infrastructure is being put back in place: electricity is
now back 24 hours a day, new highways are being built, new phone lines are
being established and garbage pickups are improving. However, the political
garbage is still in place, including some of the same structural problems
that caused the civil war.<BR>
First, the political system is still the same old sectarian system established
at the gaining of independence from France in 1943. A few reforms have given
more executive power to the Prime Minister who is to be Sunni Muslim, while
diminishing those of the president of the republic who is to be Maronite
Christian. However, these minor patch-ups are not even near enough to overhaul
such an outdated dysfunctional system. Lebanon, which is a mosaic of 18
different religious sects, needs a fully secular political and social system
in all spheres of public life to function properly. But employees today
are still being appointed in the government to fill religious quotas, and
marriages are still being exclusively performed in religious courts. A civil
marriage law is still pending because Prime Minister Hariri makes a point
of refusing to sign it, to purposely impede putting it to a vote in parliament.
I would seriously suggest not only a law allowing for civil marriages, but
also pecuniary and moral incentives to encourage inter-sectarian marriages
to achieve in a generation or two the social unification of the Lebanese
population. In addition, mixed religious neighbourhoods and towns should
be encouraged, as they already exist in different parts of the country.<BR>
Moreover, the electoral system needs total reform that would boost political
parties that are non-sectarian. This would be accomplished if the whole
country was turned into one electoral unit where parties run on the basis
of a national platform, not powerful family names or sectarian and regional
identities. The success of such a system would become the litmus test for
political maturity and awareness in the new Lebanon.<BR>
Secondly, the social infrastructure of the country remains in shambles,
with a devastated middle and working class. The Lebanese middle class was
practically decimated during the civil war, leaving two broadly-defined
social classes in the country: the wealthy on one side, especially the wealthy
political elite gravitating around Prime Minister Hariri, in addition to
the warlords, who became part of the government after acquiring new wealth
extracted from the blood of the victims of the civil war; and on the other
side are the majority of the Lebanese people, impoverished, powerless, and
working hard just to make ends meet in a country that has lost its soul.
Commercialism, exploitation and superficiality are the order of the day
with a new generation reeling from the imitation of every imaginable crust
of Westernization. <BR>
But this state of affairs could sooner or later explode into social unrest
unless war-made millionaires realize that wealth has to be shared and invested
back into the society to ensure stability and growth. Few voices in the
political arena dare to defy the ban on freedom of expression. However,
the parliamentary deputy from Beirut, Najah Wakim, has been a genuine voice
of honesty and courage for the poor and struggling people of Lebanon against
the new &quot;Hariri-cracy&quot; and its stooges.<BR>
Thirdly, the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon will always be an obstacle
to a real and stable peace in Lebanon. The constant shelling of villages,
Israeli aggression and bombings that sometimes affect the country as a whole,
such as Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996, are a constant reminder
of the frailty of the new peace. Another case in point is the Qana massacre
of 18 April 1996, when &quot;Israel&quot; intentionally shelled a United
Nations refugee camp in South Lebanon, leading to the death of over a hundred
civilians, mostly children and elderly seeking safe haven under the protection
of the UN <BR>
However, since the Zionist mentality does not respect or care for non-Jewish
lives and refuses to abide by United Nations resolutions, we may conclude
that THE ONLY WAY to get rid of the occupation in South Lebanon is through
military means. In the meantime, the fighters of Hizbollah are doing a great
job fighting the enemy, having improved their military capabilities. The
Hizbollah leadership has invited the Lebanese from all walks of life and
all religious sects to join in the fight to liberate the South. It should
be pointed out here though that the nationalist and leftist groups who started
the resistance movement against the Israeli forces of occupation back in
1982 are no longer active in the struggle for the liberation of the South.
Therefore, at this point, a joint and well-coordinated effort by Islamic,
nationalist, and leftist groups, with facilitation from the Lebanese and
Syrian armies, can force &quot;Israel&quot; to just withdraw. The recent
talk of an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the South, with French
mediation, has yet to materialize. No pre-conditions by &quot;Israel&quot;
should be accepted except for the full and complete implementation of UN
resolution 425, which calls for a total and an unconditional withdrawal
from South Lebanon. That will pave the way for peace.</P>

<P>Once there lived a man, his wife, his mother and their children. They
lived in a beautiful house in a small town. The man's great, great grandfather
built the house. It had taken many days of hard labour to build. It had
been built on fertile and lush land that the family had owned for many generations.
They were not rich people, but they were comfortable, happy and they worked
hard on the land to produce many crops that were very good to eat.<BR>
Now it so happened that a very poor man and his family arrived on their
land. They were hungry; they wore rags, had no belongings and had no home.
They had fled in terror from a treacherous landlord who had made their lives
a complete misery. They were desperate people.<BR>
The man in the beautiful house pitied them for he was a kind man and could
not bear to see his fellow human beings in need or distress. He offered
to help them with food and clothing and he even said they were welcome to
stay in his home as guests of the family until their luck picked up.<BR>
The homeless man refused the kind offer. He wanted to take the man's house
for himself.<BR>
&quot; My forefathers lived on the land where your house is, many, many
years ago. That makes it mine.&quot; He demanded.<BR>
Indeed this was true to some extent, but the ancestors of the present owner
of the big house had lived on the land since people first settled in the
village. Way back in history there had been a dispute between both of the
men's ancestors, and the homeless man's ancestors had invaded the village,
almost wiping out the ancestors of the other man.<BR>
The man who owned the house said it was big enough to shelter both families
and live alongside each other; however, the homeless man would not hear
of it.<BR>
One night the homeless man and his eldest sons marched up to the house with
sticks and swords and they began to shout and break the door down.<BR>
The door collapsed, and the terrified family inside the house drew back
in horror as the intruders set about hitting them with their sticks.<BR>
&quot;Get out, all of you!&quot; Demanded the intruder. &quot;This is no
longer your house. It belongs to me. All that you own and all of your land
is mine. Now get out or we shall kill you all.&quot; <BR>
&quot;You cannot do this,&quot; protested the homeowner &quot;You have no
right. I offered to help you all. This house has belonged to us for many
years. The land has been in my family for centuries. I will show you the
legal documents if you like.&quot;<BR>
Despite the homeowner's trying to reason with the intruder, the intruder
insisted to claim that the house was his. He and his sons began to ransack
the house, and then they beat the homeowner's children. They beat the old
mother and violated his wife. Naturally, the homeowner and his two oldest
sons tried to defend themselves, but they were brutally attacked and not
as well armed as the intruders. All of the family tried to fight off the
intruders and in the aftermath, two lives were lost. The eldest son of the
homeowner was killed and one of his little girls cruelly murdered.<BR>
The wicked intruders would stop at nothing, so the homeowner ordered his
family out of the house to flee and hide somewhere. He remained with his
other older son to fight the intruders. The fight ended with the owner being
killed. There were too many intruders for the two men to fight alone. The
young son staggered to his feet and wiped the blood from his mouth.<BR>
&quot;How can you do this to us?&quot; He protested, &quot;We have not hurt
you or your family. You know what it is like to suffer, to be homeless,
so why do this to us? You are like your cruel landlord, why? Why take out
your anger on us? We did not persecute you.&quot; The young man stared fiercely
at the intruders and wept angrily. &quot;We will come back, and we will
get our home back. You are murderous thieves and criminal scum!&quot;<BR>
Later the youth buried his father, his brother and his little sister and
located his family where they were hiding in the hills, cold, hungry, injured
and desperately afraid.<BR>
At last, relatives took them into their homes but most of the neighbours
were unsympathetic and sided with the criminals. Even some of their own
relatives rejected them. Even worse, the newly homeless family soon found
out that the largest, wealthiest household in the town had given the intruders
the idea of stealing their house in the first place!<BR>
This wealthy, powerful family thought they owned the whole village and soon
began to rule over the others, favouring some households and hating others.
The poor family was left alone to fight for justice. People told them to
stay with relatives and let the intruders stay in their old home, but this
advice was unfair and unjust, and the family tried on many occasions to
get back what belonged to them. The criminals should have been punished,
but they were allowed to get away with their wicked behaviour. What could
the poor family do with the large, powerful household so against them and
siding with the criminals?<BR>
Then one day, one of the intruders came up with a preposterous idea.<BR>
&quot;You may come back, &quot; he said with false sincerity, &quot;as our
servants. You can live in the back room and if you are good, obedient servants,
you may have some of your things back. This is a good deal. We are being
very kind to you. Now shake hands and make peace with us and leave our family
alone.&quot;<BR>
The intruder held out his hand, but the son of the dead homeowner refused
to shake hands. He spat in the dust and stamped his foot in rage.<BR>
&quot;I will never accept your ridiculous deal!&quot; He sobbed in great
rage. &quot;This is unfair. You are thieves and killers. You should be in
prison. We should have our home back. It is not yours. It was not yours
to steal.&quot;<BR>
As the angry, distraught young man turned away, most of the neighbours had
the cheek to call him extreme.<BR>
Fifty years passed since the terrible crime, and the intruders still live
in the house, unpunished. They held a big party to celebrate taking the
house. Fifty years later, the real owners did not have their own home, just
a tiny cottage on a corner of the land that was rightly theirs and some
rooms in the homes of relatives. Unlike the fairy tales, theirs was not
a happy ending and bad seemed to triumph over good.<BR>
This is a true story. It is unfair. Even a child could see that, and yet
Israel celebrates 50 years of stealing what belonged to other people. Still
they steal and still they kill. Sadly, they still go unpunished, and the
USA, the 'wealthy, powerful household', supports them.</P>
