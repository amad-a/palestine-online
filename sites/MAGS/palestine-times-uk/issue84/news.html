<H3><CENTER><A NAME="1"></A>Hamas calls on Palestinians to escalate Intifadah</CENTER></H3>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) condemned the massacre perpetrated
by the Zionist troops in the West Bank and Gaza against Palestinians who
were commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe)
on 14 May. Nine Palestinians were killed and more than 400 others were injured,
most of them in the Gaza Strip, by Israeli soldiers on what was called Black
Thursday.<BR>
&quot;Soldiers of the Enemy opened fire savagely and cruelly directly at
the Palestinian protesters who gathered in each Palestinian city, village
and street to reiterate our right to our own land and holy places and to
renew the challenge against the Zionist enemy that usurped our land on the
50th anniversary of the establishment of their terrorist State, making our
people homeless and exiled,&quot; Hamas said.<BR>
&quot;Nine martyrs and more than 400 Palestinians were injured proving that
the blood bath will continue and that our people's resistance and Jihad
will never stop as long as there is occupation,&quot; Hamas added.<BR>
It went on to say that the savage massacre committed by gangs of the Zionist
army happened while the gangs of Jewish settlers were blowing up one of
the gates of the Holy Mosque of Al Aqsa under the supervision of the Occupation
soldiers. &quot;They reveal their Talmudic hatred and dreams to destroy
Al Masjid Al Aqsa and build their alleged temple on it,&quot; Hamas pointed
out.<BR>
The Islamic Movement asserted that the &quot;Zionist crime against our people
on the day of Nakba reiterates the hostile and malicious nature of the Zionist
enemy against the Palestinians and that the so-called peace will never change
this nature.&quot;<BR>
Hamas also called on the Palestinian Authority &quot;to reunite with its
people who completely reject its political conduct that destroys our Cause
and to stop running after the fata morgana (mirage) of the peace process
which is already dead.&quot; It urged the self-rule Authority to take a
lesson and consider the People's demands to continue the struggle and Jihad
against the Zionist Occupation and &quot;who praise Ezzul Deen Al Qassam
Brigades' deeds.&quot;<BR>
Hamas called on the Palestinian People to support the option of resistance
and to escalate their street confrontations everywhere. &quot;Our arrogant
Enemy does not understand any language but the resistance and steadfastness.&quot;
The Islamic Movement urged the Arab and Muslim governments and peoples to
condemn the Zionist crime against Al Aqsa Mosque and to support the Jihad
of the Palestinian People who defend Al Aqsa and all other holy places in
Palestine.<BR>
Meanwhile, Hamas condemned, in another communiqu&eacute;, the 12 May murder
of Martyr Khairy Alqam by Jewish terrorists in Occupied Jerusalem.<BR>
Martyr Alqam, 51 and father of seven children, was stabbed to death by Jewish
settlers while he was going to work in the Holy City.<BR>
&quot;This crime cannot be separated from the mentality of the continued
Zionist terrorism against our people. It proves the continued struggle against
an enemy that does not understand any language except force.&quot;<BR>
Hamas assailed the Palestinian Authority's efforts to check the Jihad and
resistance against Occupation under the pretexts of &quot;protecting futile
agreements&quot;.<BR>
&quot;While an innocent Palestinian man is killed in Jerusalem, the security
bodies of the self-rule Authority save no efforts in chasing and harassing
the Mujahideen, and in arresting and torturing scores of our People to abort
their Jihad,&quot; Hamas said.<BR>
Hamas warned of a new security arm inside the Palestinian Authority that
works to protect the Occupation security against the Palestinian anger.
&quot;Despite the stumbling peace process, the PA's police are still chasing
and arresting our Mujahideen and are participating in joint security training
courses with Zionist security officers in Germany and the United States,&quot;
Hamas said.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="2"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Amnesty: Israel should
observe call for immediate halt to torture<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By UN Committee against Torture</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Amnesty International welcomed last month's conclusions by the United
Nations Committee against Torture, which reiterated its call to Israel to
cease immediately the use of torture and ill treatment during interrogation.
The appeal came as the Committee gave its conclusions on Israel's second
periodic report.</P>

<P>The Committee found that Israel, on its own admission, used &quot;hooding,
shackling in painful positions, sleep-deprivation and shaking&quot; against
detainees. The Committee reiterated that all these methods constituted torture,
banned by Article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Convention).</P>

<P>The Committee also expressed concern about the holding of detainees in
administrative detention, without charge or trial, for long periods, particularly
where the detainees themselves posed no threat to State security. This was
an apparent reference to the November 1997 decision of the Israeli Supreme
Court endorsing the holding of 10 Lebanese detainees as &quot;bargaining
chips&quot;. The Committee recommended that Israel review the practice of
administrative detention to ensure that it does not amount to cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment.</P>

<P>The Committee also noted Israel's &quot;apparent failure&quot; to implement
any of its previous recommendations made in 1994 and 1997, and reaffirmed
their recommendation.</P>

<P>The Committee asked the Israeli Government to incorporate the Convention's
provisions into Israeli law. Amnesty International called for a review of
the draft law on the General Security Service, currently before the Knesset.
The bill includes provisions that violate the Convention. For example, the
draft law grants GSS employees immunity from criminal liability if they
are &quot;acting in good faith and in a reasonable manner&quot;. If interrogation
rules continue to sanction torture and ill treatment, as they do now, GSS
agents will still be able to use such methods with impunity, in violation
of Article 4 of the Convention.</P>

<P>Last month, the Israeli Supreme Court held its second session reviewing
the legality of official rules that apparently authorize the GSS to use
interrogation methods such as violent shaking; sleep deprivation for prolonged
periods; shackling in painful positions; hooding; and forcing of detainees
to listen to loud noise for prolonged periods.</P>

<P>Amnesty International urged the Supreme Court to take note of the Committee's
recommendations and declare illegal all GSS interrogation methods that violate
the Convention's prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment, methods condemned by the Committee as torture.</P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="3"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Arafat scraps municipal
elections for now<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>Occupied Jerusalem - PT Staff</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>The decision by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to postpone
&quot;until further notice&quot; the organization of local elections in
the occupied territories has passed quietly, without receiving the attention
it deserves. PA officials from Arafat downward have cited a variety of largely
unconvincing reasons for the &quot;temporary freeze.&quot; Dr. Saeb Ereikat,
the chief Palestinian negotiator (who devotes little time, if any, to his
official post as Minister of Local Governance), claimed that &quot;unhelpful
political conditions&quot; have necessitated the delay--an allusion to the
Israeli refusal to carry out the second phase of redeployment in the West
Bank.</P>

<P>&quot;We want to make sure that the elections are free from any Israeli
interference,&quot; said Ereikat during a recent phone-in programme on Sawt
Falastin, the official PA radio station.</P>

<P>Arafat, sounding like the great democrat he is not, told foreign journalists
a few months ago that &quot;we have other priorities... and this is not
the most opportune time for elections.&quot;</P>

<P>In reality, the real reason for the effective cancellation of the elections
seems to have very little to do with possible Israeli interference as alleged
by the PA. Arafat, after all, was elected along with the Legislative Council
in the shadow of Israeli tanks and nobody said anything about that. Moreover,
the PLO-affiliated mayors, namely the late Fahd al Kawasmeh of Hebron and
Karim Khalaf of Ramallah, as well as Basam al Shaka'a of Nablus, were all
freely and democratically elected in 1976 when the Israeli occupation was
as ubiquitous and insidious as ever.</P>

<P>So, the real reason for the postponement must squarely lie in the PA
anxiety that if a free and democratic election were to take place now, Arafat
and his entire autonomy scheme would incur a major defeat. This would send
a clear and unwanted signal to Arafat of the massive Palestinian disillusionment
with the Oslo process and disenchantment with Arafat's autocratic and unsuccessful
leadership.</P>

<P>In other words, the elections could turn into &quot;a referendum on the
peace process&quot;, which if allowed to materialize, would effectively
amount to a vote of no confidence in Arafat himself and the entire Oslo
process.</P>

<P>This apprehension on the part of the PA was recently voiced by Legislative
Council member Rawiya al Shawwa, who said in response when questioned that
the postponement of local elections &quot;has in reality nothing to do with
the stalled peace process but has everything to do with the PA fear that
the opposition would win if elections were to be held at a time when PA
popularity is down the drain.&quot;</P>

<P>Last year, the Preventive Security Chief in Gaza, Muhammad Dahalan, handed
a secret memo to Arafat in which he recommended that local and municipal
elections &quot;be put off indefinitely or scrapped altogether in order
to forestall a possible victory by Hamas, which would be embarrassing for
the Palestinian Authority.&quot; (Hamas and the rest of the Palestinian
opposition groups expressed willingness to take part in the local elections
as opposed to the legislative elections.)</P>

<P>Dahalan has never denied the existence of the memo. Instead, he pointed
out that &quot;things of this nature happen all over the world...and it
is our duty as a security agency to issue recommendations to the political
leadership concerning real or perceived dangers.&quot;</P>

<P>Abu Ammar did not throw the &quot;Dahalan document,&quot; as it later
came to be known, into wastepaper basket. He rather instructed Ereikat to
see to it that &quot;municipal committees&quot; made up of mostly &quot;Fatah
activists&quot; be set up in virtually every town. The &quot;consolidation
process&quot; did not stop there. The PA Chairman also ordered that his
loyalists be appointed to key positions in all municipal councils.</P>

<P>In smaller villages and hamlets, Arafat ordered the appointment of &quot;local
committees&quot; composed of young and inexperienced former Fatah intifadah
activists who, using the words of a former West Bank mayor, don't know a
potato from a watermelon.</P>

<P>In some cases, elected mayors were forced to &quot;submit their resignations&quot;,
letting Arafat's loyalists take their place. In Tulkarm, for example, the
elected and long-serving mayor, Helmi Hanun, was forced to quit, only to
be replaced by another Fatah committee that is, first and foremost, responsible
to Arafat, not to the people. In Nablus, the elected mayor Basam al Shaka'a,
who lost his both legs in a Gush Emunim terrorist attack in the late 1970s,
was also ostracized and replaced by his pro-Arafat cousin, Ghassan al Shaka'a.
The appointment process itself is fraught with all types of administrative
and ethical flaws. Favoritism, nepotism, bribery and cronyism are rife features
in the bulk of the new councils.</P>

<P>The policy of &quot;appointment,&quot; the antithesis of everything the
Palestinian people aspired to, has understandably generated a preponderance
of anger and helplessness among many Palestinians. As a result, protests
took place in Tulkarm demanding that &quot;we choose our mayors.&quot; In
Ramallah, a mixed Christian-Muslim town, the town's appointed mayor, Dr.
Shawki Harb (a prominent cardiologist), resigned from his post.</P>

<P>&quot;They (the PA) told us you will be a care-taker for only six months...we
can't accept appointment as the norm rather than the exception,&quot; said
Harb upon submitting his resignation to Ereikat.</P>

<P>In addition to appointing mayors in major Palestinian towns, Ereikat
et. al also embarked on a spate of hiring &quot;nationalist&quot; mukhtars,
or clan notables, to replace the more traditional mukhtars. This act revived
dormant inter- and intra-clan animosities that were once thought to have
disappeared irreversibly in the years of the intifadah.</P>

<P>Palestinian intellectuals, who described it as &quot;reactionary&quot;
and &quot;taking us back to the Ottoman era&quot;, scathingly criticized
the stupid and harmful feat. However, neither the manifest backwardness
of the silly business of appointing mukhtars nor the criticism by the media
and intellectuals prompted the PA to reconsider its policy. Interestingly,
the only PA response was &quot;we have merely been following the desire
of the people.&quot;<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="4"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Bloody &quot;Nakba day&quot;<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>From Khalid Amayreh (Hebron)</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians took to the streets on 14 May to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nakba, the loss of Palestine to
the Jews in 1948, the brutal uprooting of most Palestinians from their homeland
and their subsequent dispersal to the Four Corners of the world.</P>

<P>The event, organized by the Palestinian Authority, was meant to remind
the world of the enormous (and continuing) nightmare inflicted upon the
Palestinians as a result of the establishment of Israel.</P>

<P>The &quot;march of the million,&quot; as it was called, was also designed
to convey a message to &quot;all concerned&quot; that the Palestinian people,
far from being obliterated or assimilated, were still awaiting a justice
50 years after the Nakba.</P>

<P>Highlighting this message, Palestinian children at the Dheishe refugee
camp near Bethlehem marched through the dusty streets of their camp, holding
aloft rusty keys to their former family homes in Palestine to symbolize
their enduring plight and unabated determination to return to the homeland
of their forefathers.</P>

<P>Moreover, the children carried signs reading the names of their former
villages, some of them only a few miles across the &quot;Green Line,&quot;
the 1948 armistice line between Israeli proper and the West Bank.</P>

<P>In Nablus, where as many as 50,000 marchers took to the streets, masked
Fatah activists held automatic rifles rather than keys, firing repeatedly
into the air. Their message was clear, namely that they were readily willing
to revert to armed struggle as soon as a death certificate was issued to
the moribund peace process.</P>

<P>Hamas was also vociferous. Sheikh Hamed al Beitawi, a senior Hamas leader
in the Nablus area, led a march of 15,000 Hamas supporters, and fired a
pistol into the air to mark &quot;the end of this humiliating peace and
the beginning of a new era of resistance.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The Palestinian Authority should be brave enough to tell the people
that Oslo was a failure, so that we could resume the armed struggle side
by side,&quot; said al Beitawi as Israeli and American flags and Benyamin
Netanyahu's effigy were being trampled on and set ablaze.</P>

<P>In Ramallah's Manara Square, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat addressed the
marchers in a live radio and television broadcast.</P>

<P>&quot;The right of return is a sacred right that no one has the right
to deny us,&quot; said Arafat in a rather soft voice, reflecting his deteriorating
health.</P>

<P>The PA Chairman reiterated essentially the same words he usually utters
in his public speeches, saying &quot;We aren't asking for the moon, but
rather for an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital.&quot;</P>

<P>However, to suit the occasion, Arafat added that &quot;We are not a guest
in the world but right-owners who deserve a homeland like others in this
vast world.&quot;</P>

<P>Nonetheless, in an unconscious indication reflecting his lack of faith
in the Oslo process, Arafat recited a Qur'anic verse three times that prophesizes
the ultimate demise of Israel at the hands of Muslims:</P>

<P>And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture, that indeed
you would do mischief on the earth twice and you will become tyrants and
extremely arrogant! So, when the promise came for the first of the two,
We sent against you slaves of Ours given to terrible warfare. They entered
the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was a promise (completely)
fulfilled. Then We gave you once again, a return of victory over them. And
We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower.
(And We said): &quot;If you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil
(you do it) against yourselves.&quot; Then, when the second promise came
to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to make your faces sorrowful and to
enter the mosque (of Jerusalem) as they had entered it before, and to destroy
with utter destruction all that fell in their hands (Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din
Al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, Interpretation of the Meanings of
The Noble Qur'an in the English Language, Al-Isra, Surah XVII:4-7.</P>

<P>The above Qur'anic verses constitute the essence of Islamist (e.g. Hamas)
perception on how the conflict between Jews and Muslims over Palestine will
ultimately come to an end, a prophetic view shared by Jewish and Christian
scriptures.</P>

<P>Protests turn bloody<BR>
The commemoration of Nakba, which the PA said was planned to be peaceful,
soon turned into &quot;clashes&quot; between stone-hurling Palestinian youngsters
and well-entrenched and ever-ready Israeli soldiers, who did not hesitate
to shoot to kill.</P>

<P>The most violent outburst took place in the Gaza Strip along the so-called
friction lines around the Eretz checkpoint in the north and the Kush Katif
settlement bloc in the south. There, thousands of Palestinian youths, depressed
by the claustrophobic and narrow horizons of the small Gaza enclave where
they are squeezed hopelessly between Israel and the sea, sought to vent
their frustration by throwing stones at the heavily armed and well protected
Israeli soldiers. They retaliated with metal-coated rubber bullets and eventually
live ammunition.</P>

<P>The result was five Palestinians dead, including a male nurse who showed
up to give first-aid to the wounded, and as many as 400 injured--10 of them
with serious gun-shot wounds.</P>

<P>In the West Bank, at least one Palestinian was killed at the Qalandia
refugee camp, and scores of demonstrators were injured in Hebron at the
Bab El Zawiya Square, a few hundred metres from the Jewish settlement enclave
in the heart of the town. Similarly violent clashes also took place in Ramallah,
resulting in about 100 Palestinian injuries.</P>

<P>PA information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbou described the high Palestinian
casualties as a massacre, accusing IDF soldiers of having adopted a &quot;a
shoot-to-kill policy.&quot; For their part, the Israelis retorted as usual
by saying that they opened fire only when their soldiers' lives were endangered.</P>

<P>Eventually, by nightfall, the clashes receded as Palestinian police forcefully
removed protesters from &quot;the friction lines&quot;, especially after
receiving a stern warning from Israeli military officials who reportedly
threatened to enter PA-held areas if calm was not restored.</P>

<P>Bloody Thursday, as it is now dubbed by many Palestinians, was an expression
of Palestinian disillusionment with what has evidently become a disgraceful
peace process that is not worth maintaining.</P>

<P>Moreover, it was also an example of typical Israeli brutality on the
very day Palestinians were remembering when their plight began 50 years
ago, a metaphor suggesting that what was true then still holds true now.

fire to Al Aqsa gate<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=+0>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem (14 May) Around midnight on 13 May, Jewish extremists
set fire to Bab El Maghanmeh, one of Al Aqsa Mosque's main entrance gates,
destroying the large solid wood door and causing some damage to nearby structures.</P>

<P>Sheikh Mohammed Hussein, Director of Al Masjidul Aqsa, said the Jewish
perpetrators tossed a highly flammable substance at the huge gate/door around
midnight, setting the door on fire.</P>

<P>Sheikh Hussein said Jewish extremists perpetrated the crime, possibly
in connivance with circles within the Israeli government and security forces.</P>

<P>&quot;We are well aware that several Jewish groups have been trying to
attack the Al Aqsa Mosque; we also know that the Israeli government is tacitly
encouraging the terrorists,&quot; said Sheikh Hussein, who helped extinguish
the fire.</P>

<P>Moreover, the Sheikh warned that the incident was not auguring well for
the future, saying, &quot;I have no doubt that their ultimate goal is the
destruction of the Mosque.&quot;</P>

<P>In 1969, a Zionist extremist set fire to the Mosque, destroying much
of its interior, including the ancient mimbar.</P>

<P>Moreover, Israeli authorities opened a subterranean tunnel beneath the
al Aqsa Mosque in 1996, triggering widespread Palestinian protests.</P>

<P>The recent crime of arson took place at a time when hundreds of thousands
of Palestinians are marking the Nakba, the usurpation of Palestine by the
Zionists.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="6"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Netanyahu: &quot;Peace
process is dead; not our fault&quot;</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem (22 May)- Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu
admitted for the first time on 22 May that the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process was dead.<BR>
Speaking before the diplomatic corps at West Jerusalem's King David Hotel,
Netanyahu said, &quot;The peace process has ceased to exist,&quot; adding
that &quot;Israel was not responsible for the ostensible collapse of the
peace process.&quot;<BR>
The extremist Israeli premier, who in the run-up to the Israeli general
elections in 1996 vowed to undo the Oslo process, blamed the Palestinians
for &quot;the death of paralysis&quot; of the Oslo process, arguing that
resistance operations by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad were directly responsible
for corroding the peace process and creating an atmosphere of absolute distrust
between the parties to the peace process.<BR>
However, Netanyahu ignored the ongoing Israeli campaign of settlement building
in the West Bank and adamant refusal to carry out the second phase of redeployment
as stipulated in the Oslo agreement.<BR>
Earlier, Netanyahu reportedly said he was inclined to hold a summit meeting
with Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat in order to try to convince him
to &quot;lower Palestinian expectations and accept a compromise deal that
would guarantee Israeli security while giving Palestinians a dignified autonomy.&quot;<BR>
According to Netanyahu's communications director, David Bar Elan, Netanyahu
raised the idea of a new summit with Arafat during his recent visit to the
United States.<BR>
Never the less, it seems unlikely that Arafat will agree to a new summit
with Netanyahu as the Palestinian leader has become convinced that Netanyahu
was after the destruction of the peace process.<BR>
On 21 May, Arafat warned again that the entire Middle East would explode
in fire if the peace process was allowed to collapse.<BR>
Speaking in Gaza following a meeting of the Fatah Revolutionary Council,
Arafat said the Palestinians had other choices, which could mean a possible
resumption of the Intifadah.<BR>
In other developments, an Israeli military court ruled on 22 May that the
three Israeli soldiers who murdered three Palestinian labourers near Tarqumya
in March were innocent and therefore would not stand trial.<BR>
The decision was announced after army prosecutors opined that the soldiers
in question behaved properly in accordance with standing orders and committed
no wrongdoing.<BR>
A representative of the bereaved Palestinian families was not surprised.<BR>
Hasan Rajoub, a relative of Adnan Rajoub, one of the three labourers murdered
by the Zionist soldiers, said he didn't expect &quot;one iota of justice
from the Zionists.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The judge is my enemy,&quot; said Rajoub.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="7"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Liberty calls for an end
to torture in PA prisons<BR>
and for immediate release of political detainees</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><B>London-PT:</B><BR>
Liberty for the Muslim World criticized the Palestinian self-rule authority
for its record of human rights abuses and continued arbitrary conduct against
the Palestinians in the occupied territories. <BR>
In a statement it issued on 13 May, Liberty said that since the announcement
more than a month and a half ago by the Palestinian Authority (PA) that
it was investigating the murder of Muhyiddin Al-Sharif, a Hamas military
leader, various Palestinian security bodies have continued to target and
detain any person suspected of association with Al-Sharif and the Hamas
military wing, or suspected of involvement in Al-Sharif's assassination,
whose circumstances remain obscure. <BR>
&quot;These detentions have been taking place in what is clearly a total
absence of the rule of law, a matter that has been a source of utmost concern
to local lawyers and human rights activists,&quot; Liberty said, adding
that the Palestinian security apparatus seems to have been given free rein
to pressure detainees, both physically and psychologically, and to intimidate
them so as to confess to having had a role in murdering Al-Sharif. <BR>
&quot;The excesses of Palestinian interrogators and the acquiescence of
the PA political leadership has prompted the Attorney General to resign
his job in protest. After detaining a number of Hamas leaders, who have
challenged the PA's claim that Al-Sharif was killed by his own comrades
within the Hamas military wing, the security apparatus have arrested a number
journalists for allegedly having transgressed the limits set by the Palestinian
Authority in covering the story of Al-Sharif's assassination. Abbas Al-Mumani
(25 years old), who worked as a photographer for Reuters press agency, continues
to be in detention.&quot;<BR>
Liberty pointed out that Al-Mumani, who managed to escape from detention
only to be re-arrested several hours later, has been subjected to brutal
persecution at the hands of his Palestinian interrogators who seek to extract
from him the source of a video tape, which Reuters released to the world
media. It added that the PA was agitated by the appearance in the tape of
a Hamas military leader who refuted the PA murder story and accused Israel
of being ultimately responsible for the liquidation of his comrade.<BR>
In addition to Al-Mumani, a number of Palestinian students from Bir Zeit
University, An-Najah University, Bethlehem University and the Islamic University
in Gaza have been arrested and are said to be persecuted. The students have
been either suspected of association with Hamas or are being punished for
protesting against the detention of their colleagues.<BR>
&quot;Liberty for the Muslim World is abhorred that the Palestinian Authority
resorts to the very same measures the Palestinians under occupation have
for many years condemned the Israelis for adopting. It is quite astonishing
that Western political circles, especially in the United States, exhibit
total indifference toward the PA violation of human rights in spite of the
fact that the PA acquires both legitimacy and existence from the Western
powers that sponsor the current peace process between the PA and Israel,&quot;
said the statement.<BR>
It strongly denounced the PA violations of Palestinian human rights, including
the storming of houses, arbitrary arrests, the use of physical and psychological
torture and threats of liquidation or abuse of relatives, especially female
family members. &quot;Such internationally forbidden practices seem to have
become routine practices in the areas administered by the PA,&quot; Liberty
asserted.<BR>
It called for the immediate release of all detainees, including journalist
Abbas Al-Mumani. In order to guarantee respect for human rights and put
an end to excesses, it is essential that the rule of law and respect for
the role of the judiciary be restored. &quot;Furthermore, it would be conducive
to the public interest to prosecute security officers responsible for massive
violations of human rights. Liberty urges Reuters, who has been accused
by local human rights groups of deserting Al-Mumani after his detention
in spite of his services, to raise his case at the highest levels possible
and to exert all possible efforts in order to secure his release,&quot;
said the statement.<BR>

of Jerusalem usurpation</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem- PT (24 May) In a step meant to reaffirm Zionist usurpation
of Baytul Makdes (Jerusalem), the Israeli occupation authorities celebrated
on 24 May the thirty-first anniversary of its military occupation and subsequent
annexation of East Jerusalem, a city of utmost religious importance to Muslims,
Christians and Jews.</P>

<P>Celebrations took the form of several rallies, marches and concerts,
as well as a military parade in the streets of the Holy City during which
speakers vowed to &quot;clean Jerusalem of goyem&quot; (non-Jews).</P>

<P>Moreover, hundreds of Messianic Jews belonging to ultra-orthodox groups
sought to forcibly enter the Haram al Sharif plaza in order to reassert
&quot;Jewish ambitions of seeing the rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon.&quot;</P>

<P>However, Muslim Wakf officials, who warned earlier that any encroachment
into the Islamic shrine by the extremists could turn into a bloodbath, repulsed
the Jewish settlers.</P>

<P>The extremists are affiliated with such terrorist groups as &quot;Hay've
Kayam,&quot; &quot;Kahane Hay&quot; and &quot;the Temple Mount Faithfuls,&quot;
which make the &quot;prayed-for destruction of the Al Aqsa Mosque&quot;
the centre of their ideology and theology.</P>

<P>Having failed to enter the Haram al Sharif compound, the rowdy settlers
then headed towards the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of the
PLO in East Jerusalem.</P>

<P>There the settlers shouted racist slogans against Muslims and Arabs,
including &quot;death to the Arabs,&quot; and &quot;Arabs out of Jerusalem.&quot;</P>

<P>The largely nervous festivities continued till after nightfall as thousands
of soldiers representing the various branches of the Israeli army paraded
through the occupied Arab town.</P>

<P>Marking the occasion, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu reiterated
his government's intransigent stance on the West Bank.</P>

<P>&quot;The River Jordan will always be Israel's eastern border,&quot;
said Netanyahu before a large rally at Jabal al Mukabber, renamed by the
Zionists as Mount Herzel.</P>

<P>Netanyahu also repeated earlier statements that the Oslo peace process
had died two years ago, even before he became Prime Minister in May 1996.</P>

<P>Israel's ostentatious celebrations of the conquest of Jerusalem drew
sharp and angry reactions from the Palestinian Authority.</P>

<P>PA Chairman Yasser Arafat called the celebrations &quot;provocative&quot;,
arguing that &quot;Jerusalem was an occupied city just like the rest of
the West Bank.&quot;</P>

<P>Another Palestinian official, Ahmed Abdul Rahman, threatened to &quot;withdraw
our recognition of Israel&quot; and &quot;resume armed struggle.&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, around 13 Palestinian labourers were injured by Israeli gunfire
on 24 May near an Israeli roadblock at the northern edge of the autonomous
enclave of Bethlehem.</P>

<P>Palestinian sources said the labourers were prevented from proceeding
to Jerusalem by Israeli soldiers prompting them to hurl stones at the occupation
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets and live ammunition. <BR>

prisoners in honour of Sheikh Yassin</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Tehran-</B> The Iranian authorities on 11 May released four Palestinians
who had been prisoners of war since the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s. Abu
Mohammed Mustafa, Hamas' representative in Syria, said the release of the
four prisoners, who fought with Iraq against Iran, came as a gesture to
honour Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, who was visiting
Iran on an invitation from the Iranian leadership. Abu Mohammed Mustafa
has also supervised the handing over of the four prisoners to the Iraqi
border authorities in the presence of a representative of the Red Cross.<BR>

grants honourable degree to Sheikh Yassin</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Sana'a- The Yemeni University of Sana'a last month granted Sheikh Ahmad
Yassin, Hamas spiritual leader, an honourable Ph.D. degree on the occasion
of his first visit to Yemen. The degree was given to Sheikh Yassin in a
ceremony attended by more than 40,000 Yemeni students and general public.
The President of the University of Sana'a, Dr. Abdel Aziz Maqaleh handed
the degree to Sheikh Yassin, saying in his speech that the Yemeni academics
support Hamas and its political programme that resists the so-called peace
process and rejects the normalization of ties with the Zionists. Dr. Maqaleh
called for dealing with Sheikh Yassin as the representative of the Palestinian
People, adding that Hamas is maintaining the principles that were wasted
by others (the Palestinian Authority). He pointed out that the University's
council unanimously decided to grant the honourable degree to Sheikh Yassin
upon a recommendation from the Faculty of Islamic Studies. In his speech,
Sheikh Yassin thanked the Yemeni people and government for the warm welcome
he received during his visit to Sana'a. Sheikh Yassin denied that his tour
of several Arab and Islamic countries would not be made without an approval
from the U.S. government. &quot;When the Arabs felt that the peace process
reached a deadlock, they found that resistance represented by Hamas was
the only option,&quot; Sheikh Yassin said. He wondered how the U.S., which
sees Sheikh Yassin as an anti-peace terrorist, could agree to his tour of
the Arab countries. &quot;The U.S. is not pleased to see a Hamas leader
in any Arab country. But we are not afraid of the U.S. or Europe. We adhere
to the Arab and Muslim peoples who support us,&quot; Sheikh Yassin concluded.<BR>

leader</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P>Jenin (West Bank)- A Palestinian lawyer revealed that his client Sheikh
Jamal Abul Haija, a prominent Hamas leader in Jenin north of the occupied
West Bank, was subjected to violent head shaking while he was interrogated
by the General Security Service's (Shin Bet) officers at Jalama jail. Lawyer
Fares Abu Hassan said traces of torture were obviously seen on his client's
body when he was brought before an Israeli court in Jalama. The lawyer said
the Hamas leader was accused by the Occupation authorities of taking part
in public activities in the self-rule areas, including delivering a speech
commemorating the assassination of Martyr Yahya Ayyash. Lawyer Abu Hassan
said he would submit a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court to stop using
the violent shaking against his client. Sheikh Abul Haija was arrested in
the middle of last April.<BR>
