<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">The Intifada must continue</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Khalid Amayreh</b></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The flowing Palestinian blood, which has been shed and is being shed
unceasingly in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as in 1948-Palestine, must not go
in vain. The Intifada of al-Aqsa must not be allowed to become the subject of cheap and
futile political haggling here and there, whether at the hands of our murderers and
grave-diggers (the Zionists), or by our ultimate tormentor (the Americans), or, indeed, at
the hands of our so-called &#147;Arab brethren&#148; or, first and foremost, at the hands
of the Palestinian leadership of Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is manifestly clear that, with a few exceptions, the Palestinian, Arab
and Muslim masses have grown fed up and disenchanted with the futility and impotence of
the Arab regimes. Indeed, the masses will not accept that over 140 martyrs and as many
4,000 injuries, some of whom are clinically-dead, be expended in vain just to appease
American demands and Zionist insolence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is amply clear that the recent American-orchestrated
&#147;international summit at Sharm el-Sheikh and the subsequent &#147;Arab summit&#148;
in Cairo&#150;in both of which the American and Israeli presence and influence were strong
and conspicuous&#150;were not really aimed at stopping the Zionist carnage. The Zionists,
after all, have been murdering us <i>en masse</i> and shedding our blood for decades.
Indeed, Zionist massacres in Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan are too numerous to be
listed and too gruesome to be forgotten.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The truth, however, which the un-elected Arab despots refuse to recognize
and try their best to suppress, is that their recent meetings were aimed at preventing the
Aqsa Intifada from spreading to their backyards. Indeed, the last thing Arab despotic
regimes would want to see is an intifada against the interests of their American
protectors and sustainers, which would be an intifada against their repressive and
decadent regimes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is very sad that the Egyptian leadership, which receives $2 billion
from the U.S. in return for suppressing Islamic movements in Egypt and guarding
&#147;stability&#148; in the region, played a key and suspicious role in arranging the two
summits&#133;all this at American orders, American instructions and American-revealed
decisions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, President Mubarak of Egypt, disclosed why all these hectic
activities took place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;If we don&#146;t move to stop this violence, it will spread to our
countries and it will burn our fingers.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the problem doesn&#146;t stop at the desecration of
al-Masjidul Aqsa by the convicted Zionist war criminal Ariel Sharon, nor at the serious
threats by the Zionists to destroy the Islamic shrine in order to build in its place a
Jewish temple. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the problem doesn&#146;t stop at Barak&#146;s constant
efforts and bellicosity to impose surrender on the Palestinian people. Nor does the
problem lie in restraining the Zionist murderers from using excessive power, including
helicopter gunships and rockets, against unarmed Palestinian protestors, or putting an end
to Jewish settlers&#146; wanton terrorism against Palestinian farmers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The truth of the matter is that the main preoccupation of Arab despots,
most of whom receive their instructions from the White House, is simply to abort the
uprising in Occupied Palestine and then revert to &#147;business as usual&#148; with the
Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why do they want to abort the current uprising in Palestine? Because the
uprising is awakening the erstwhile dormant Arab masses, awakening them to the treachery
of their leaders who act as &#147;high commissioners&#148; in the service of the
world&#146;s evil empire, the United States, and who conspire with the enemies of Arabs
and Muslims against their own people whom they claim to represent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the White House must have been disquieted, to put it mildly, to
see demonstrations take place in countries such as Oman and some Arabian Gulf states,
where public protests are something of a taboo. This is so because a demonstration in the
Gulf region, would sound the bells of alarm in the White House, that centre of evil that
has been accustomed to arrogating our oil and shedding our blood to the extent that it has
come to take that for granted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this is what made Clinton and his despicable Secretary of State to
hasten to the region to protect their interests before things become really nasty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For all these reasons, the Intifada must continue in order to convince the
United States that enabling Israel to kill Palestinian children with American-supplied
weaponry can&#146;t be reconciled with having &#147;good relations&#148; with Arab and
Muslim countries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, a word or two to the Zionists. You should realize that time is
not on your side. There are 4 million Palestinians in your midst now in Palestine, and
soon we (you and we) will be fifty-fifty!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, you should not forget that you live amongst 300 million Arabs
and as many Muslims in this region. It is true that these people are suppressed and
&#147;reined in&#148; by their despots, but that is changing, and the people will rise up,
sooner that you imagine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, you may now continue to carry out your wanton killing and murder of
our children. You may continue to slaughter innocent kids, like Muhammed al-Durra and Sara
Abdul Haq&#133;you may do all of that. But, someday, you will surely pay the price.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Talmud, children are punished for their fathers&#146;
evil deeds if they continue to walk in their evil paths.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">Clinton&#146;s latest legacy: A Fiasco at Sharm
el-Sheik</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Dr. Musil Shehada</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why do we expect total failure when the U.S. becomes a mediator in the
Middle East peace process? Could it be mere strange coincidences that every time the U.S.
interferes in the name of peace, more conflicts ensue? Looking in retrospect through the
history of the U.S. involvement since the 1950s, a pattern emerges which unveils a strange
phenomenon that when peace becomes the topic of U.S. involvement, it would turn into
another conflict and a source of violence and bloodshed for the very near future. At the
latest Camp David failure Mr. Clinton was quick to point the finger of blame at the
Palestinians for such failure, yet in Sharm el-Sheik he stated that we should go beyond
trying to blame who started the latest violence and proceed to contain it! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The irony is that all leaders at such conferences, including our own,
point to international legality as the best basis to achieve peace, yet none of them use
such an international platform when further deliberation is processed in the peace
negotiations. Even with the presence of Mr. Kofi Annan, the present United Nations
Secretary General and representative of the world body at such peace talks, no
international reference is used as a framework for peace. Whatever happened to UN
Partition Resolution 181 or 194 for the right of Return for the Palestinian refugees? Not
even 242 is mentioned any more except in vague terms to give some international umbrella
to the peace negotiations but without seeking actual implementation of the same. Such UN
resolutions are not moot, as much as Israel in pursuing its expansion policies would enjoy
ignoring such international legal resolutions, which might limit Israeli greed for more
land while the U.S. would simply dance on the Zionist mantra. The U.S. has proven to be an
obedient client for international Zionism. In 1947, it was the U.S. who, following Zionist
instructions, created the UN Partition and threatened many other countries that were
economically dependent on them. In 1967, resolution 242 was adopted by the UN with the
help of the U.S. and under the direct instructions of the Zionists to ignore resolution
181 and treat the Palestinians as mere refugees and not as seekers of national identity or
qualified to return to their homes in conformity with resolution 194. At Camp David I, the
U.S. pressured Egypt into dropping any reference to the rights of the Palestinians and the
PLO in order to cater to the wishes of Israel. In 1991, the U.S., following the directives
of Israel, pressured the Arab world to ignore the Palestinian delegations as an
independent one at the Madrid conference and somehow include them as part of the Jordanian
team. When the U.S. sponsored the peace ceremony on the White House Lawn in 1993 in
accordance with the Oslo accords, a glimmer of hope permeated the Arab circles that the
U.S. was finally coming around to becoming an honest peace broker. It was not long after
that when Israel, contravening such accords, picked up the pace of expanding more
settlements into Jerusalem and the West Bank and without one single serious American
protest at such violations. No need here to enumerate the number of vetoes that the U.S.
used in its blind support of Israel at the UN when censorship resolutions were to be
adopted to stop such Israeli violations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet with all such chronology of U.S. blind support to Israel
notwithstanding, we are still acting so na�vely by placing the destiny of our people at
the mercy of such a flagrantly dishonest broker. The 16 October 2000 Sharm el-Sheik Peace
conference was not an exception to the above pattern, when again the oppressed
Palestinians are to stop their Intifada and succumb to Israeli cruel hegemony in the West
Bank and Gaza and acquiesce to the peace of the prison. Arafat, to please the oppressors
of our people, was quick to re-arrest the Hamas and Islamic Jihad patriots and even went
further to allow Israeli authorities to arrest those from the infuriated public who
&#147;lynched&#148; the two Mossad agents who infiltrated our Intifada with the evil
intent of killing its leaders. A question should be in order here when we ask how did the
Israeli authorities manage to enter the PA controlled areas in Ramallah and place under
arrest almost ten Palestinians for the &#147;lynching&#148; charge without the full
support and cooperation of the PA? Of course Israel is not bound, in a similar fashion, to
arrest those who killed over 100 of our children and never mind the thousands of injured
Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When are we ever going to wake up to the simple fact that the U.S. and
Israel represent one and the only policy which is that of Israel? When are we going to
realize that these Palestinian youths are dying to defend the honour of all the Arabs when
protecting the Al-Aqsa Mosque and other holy sites? I might be very ambitious to demand
that Arab leaders unify against this unholy alliance between Israel and the U.S., but
can&#146;t we at least do the minimum to help the Arab cause? Why are we still keeping
Israeli embassies and offices in the Arab world? Why are we still dealing economically
with the Zionist enemy? Why aren&#146;t we sponsoring armed struggle to liberate our lands
from the cruel Zionist oppressor? Why are we still soliciting the help of the U.S. in the
peace process? Do we honestly believe that the U.S. will ever be on the side of justice
with all its pro-Israel records notwithstanding? Isn&#146;t it time that we should
re-assess our values, our tactics and our friends? I hope that the coming Arab summit will
answer some of these questions; however, I will remain on the pessimistic side until
hopefully I am proven wrong. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Blood Unites Palestinian, Arab,
Muslim Masses</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ramzy Baroud*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian uprisings have always been a mirror, reflecting the
degradation and fragmentation in which the Arab and Muslim world is swamped. The failure
of the political leadership of the Middle East to assist the Palestinian revolution of
1936 is a time in history that was hardly forgotten. Once again, Arab and Muslim leaders
are following the same pattern of expressing anger in written form, and then bashfully
standing aside to see what will become of the disgustingly unbalanced war, as youngsters
battle tanks and handguns battle missiles. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Will the Intifada of 2000 be any different than the Intifada of
1987&#150;not in its style and tactics, but rather in its geopolitical reach and in the
effect it may leave regarding the political perception in the Arab World toward Israel,
the United States and the so-called peace process? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such effects are already evident, even though the newest Intifada is still
in its infancy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the early phase of the Intifada was labelled with a word, it would be
&#147;unity&#148;. Beginning in the Palestinian streets, Jerusalem, the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip have never experienced a greater sense of oneness since long before the early
1990s instalment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a middleman between the Palestinian
people and Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only were Palestinians distant from their own leadership, but they
were also distant from one another, as a class-based society immediately emerged. The rich
and the poor, the politically influential and the politically undermined&#150;even the
oppressed and oppressor&#150;were all phenomena that were little familiar to a nation that
prided itself in its common cause and in a common enemy. But these barriers which were
created by years of PA impotence and lack of clear vision suddenly went up in smoke, or
perhaps were shattered by Israel&#146;s random shelling. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Intifada is once more sweeping the Palestinian people with change,
reorganizing its priorities and forcing the PA to move from the middle area to where the
people stand. Following massive protests in the Gaza Strip during the &#147;day of
rage&#148;, a meeting in Gaza took place, with almost every Palestinian faction, party or
movement leader from the PA&#146;s side or the opposition present. This meeting was the
Intifada&#146;s most vital achievement, reuniting the Palestinian front. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the celebration of oneness barely stopped there, as it spilled over
into Palestinian towns as well as villages within Israel, reshaping the geopolitical
arrangements of the area once more and symbolically removing the Green Line, a myth that
was instituted by Israel to separate the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza from their
brethren. The Palestinian blood poured in Nazareth, Um al-Fahem, Kufr Qarih and elsewhere,
and the martyrs and the wounded were only an extension of the Intifada in the West Bank
and Gaza. They were all Palestinians and they all died for a common cause in a way that
reemphasized their everlasting unity, despite decades of systematic geographic separation
dictated by Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Gulf war and the sanctions imposed on Iraq thereafter divided Arab and
Muslim nations into blocs and political camps. The already existent Arab fragmentation was
widening, and the gap suffered constant growth. Despite one decade of deadly sanctions
imposed on Iraq, and despite the United States&#146; aggression on Sudan and Afghanistan
in 1998, the Arab masses were too oppressed and too consumed by their mere struggle for
survival to play any part in shaping the course of their countries&#146; policies. The
signing of an unjust peace treaty with Israel in 1993 seemed to be the beginning of the
end, and signs of failure followed as countries like Mauritania, Indonesia and others
lined up to shake Israel&#146;s hand as the need for defiance appeared meaningless. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet, with the outbreak of the Intifada, Arab and Muslim masses took to the
streets in search for the pride of a nation that had been discarded for too long. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Gulf States, the lingering Gulf war conflict appeared irrelevant
and too old to remember, as thousands of men, women and children carried Palestinian flags
and chanted with tears and fury against Israel&#146;s savagery and the United States&#146;
policy of double standards, calling for the liberation of a presumably forsaken land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Indonesia, despite the scars left by civil war and revolution,
Indonesians put their troubles behind them and rushed to the streets for a cause far away
yet closer to the heart than any other. Their hands clutched tight to each other as they
chanted for Al Aqsa Mosque and as the Israeli flag&#150;a symbol of oppression&#150;was
put to flames. The hands extending with torches to burn it were many. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Egypt, universities and mosques, the living conscience of Egypt&#146;s
intellectuals and birthplaces of revolutions reflected the pain of Palestinians, as if it
was felt by every single Egyptian. A great nation was stripping itself from the shadow of
death and conflict into one chant and one united front. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Europe and the United States, the Arab and Muslim communities, consumed
with the challenges of the West and the burden of its discrimination, were too spirited to
step aside and watch. In Germany 20,000 Muslims and scores of sympathizers demonstrated in
perhaps the largest gathering of Muslims in many years. In many U.S. cities, protestors
were telling the world of their rage and fury. They were also searching for a definition
of their role in their country and strongly pushing for a desperately needed unity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It wasn&#146;t only Al Aqsa Mosque and the Palestinian Intifada that
occupied the minds of the angry Arab and Muslim nations. The Intifada was a symbol, a
wake-up call, a loud and passionate reminder of the tragic state which these nations have
reached. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Palestinian, Arab and Muslim masses have strongly and doubtlessly
confirmed their unity, and with blood sanctifying their togetherness, will the Arab and
Muslim governments continue to be the faithful guards of the interests of the West and
Israel? Or will these governments finally side with the just causes of their people,
rather than stand as a barrier between the people and their goals? Only time will tell.<i><b><u>

<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Shahid Bolsen</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is a misleading, and thus extremely important, concept being
affirmed in both the summit at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt and the American media coverage of
it. Indeed, this concept has prevailed throughout the past seven years of the so-called
Peace Process, and it has even affected the way Muslims themselves view the situation in
Palestine and the manner by which they seek to address it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Simply stated, this concept holds that Israel&#146;s relationship with the
Palestinians is essentially only a matter of concern for the Israelis, the Palestinians
(grudgingly) and the Americans, to the exclusion of the rest of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The diversion that this misconception has created is one of the greatest
achievements of the Peace Process: that Israel and the United States have proactively
engaged the Palestinians in an effort to bring about a peaceful settlement to the ongoing
Middle East crisis is thoroughly accepted by the American majority. Indeed, this view has
been so successfully propagated that every foreign policy pundit and regional analyst
interviewed on the major networks, CNN and Fox news have all been asked at some point in
the last two weeks, &#147;if the current clashes mean the end of the Peace Process, then
what else is there?&#148; Clearly assuming, or at least proposing, that there have been,
and are, no alternative approaches to a resolution of the conflict and that the Oslo Peace
Process is the exclusive avenue for a settlement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This misrepresentation has actually made it possible, for instance, for
the American-sponsored &#147;emergency&#148; summit at Sharm el-Sheikh to be portrayed as
a genuine effort, as President Clinton said, &#147;to end the current violence.&#148;
&#145;Ending the violence,&#146; however, has only proven to be a complicated matter for
the Americans and Israelis. The United Nations did not perceive it as terrifically
perplexing when they demanded in Security Council resolution 1322 that Israel halt its
firing against civilians. The respected Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN),
the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) and the International Committee of
Jurists (ICJ) did not find the matter of &#145;ending the violence&#146; particularly
complex when they unanimously called upon Israel to &#147;cease forthwith the use of
illegal ammunition and heavy weapons, including helicopters with guided missiles, against
civilians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Human Rights Watch, perhaps the best known human rights watchdog in the
world, was able to conclude with remarkable clarity, if some understatement, that Israel
&#147;showed a troubling proclivity&#148; to unleash deadly force against largely unarmed
Palestinians, of whom at least half the victims have been under the age of 18.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, it is safe to say that a summit by the Israelis, the Palestinians and
the Americans to discuss ways of bringing the violence to a halt was, essentially, a means
by which Israel and the United States could avoid addressing the obvious solution: forcing
Israel to adhere to the consensus of the international community, which recognized the
inconvenient fact that Israel alone has been the aggressor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The summit, also, of course, was the only possible way to extract from
Yasser Arafat a commitment to stop Palestinian violence, which is implicitly an acceptance
of the U.S. and Israeli position that there has been Palestinian violence, as opposed to
legitimate Palestinian self-defence and resistance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this has been the pattern, and this is why the Peace Process must be
presented as the only possible avenue for settlement, because it is the only way to remove
the Palestinian situation from the international forum into a forum controlled by Israel
and the United States. In other words, it is the only forum through which the co-agendas
of the U.S. and Israel can be realized.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Not only is there an alternative avenue by which a resolution could
potentially be reached, it can be argued that the Peace Process itself exists precisely to
divert attention away from that alternative.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A good example of this diversion is readily available in the current
crisis, which has been reported as being in essence a battle over Jerusalem. We are told
that both sides claim a right to sovereignty over the Holy City; it is Holy to both sides;
both sides want it as their capital, so on and so on.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the Camp David negotiations, and indeed, ever since then, we have
been continuously informed that the &#145;sticking point&#146; to a final settlement was
the status of Jerusalem. More often than not, we have been told that Yasser Arafat refused
to accept the generous Israeli offer of a shared capital in the ancient city. What is not
reported, because the discussion must always be kept within the controlled
U.S.-Israel-Arafat framework, is that &#145;sharing&#146; Jerusalem is not an offer that
Ehud Barak, or any Israeli leader, is authorized to make. The United Nations, the
agreed-upon arbiter of International Law, has stated with satisfying bluntness that
Israel&#146;s claim to Jerusalem as its capital was &#147;invalid&#148; (UN Security
Council resolution 252), and censured Israel for trying to alter the independent status of
Jerusalem (267), and flatly called Israel&#146;s claim to Jerusalem &#147;null and
void&#148; (476). Israel&#146;s refusal to accept the edicts of the international
community, through the alchemy of the Peace Process, becomes the Palestinians refusal to
accept Israeli compromise. In short, no one has accepted Israel&#146;s claim to Jerusalem
at all; small wonder then that the only two countries which have accepted Israel&#146;s
claim would be the only two countries involved in the negotiations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The tunnel-vision through which Americans&#150;including Muslim
Americans&#150;are made to view the situation in Palestine concentrates upon the role of
the U.S. as the central &#145;peace broker&#146; in the region and has tended to mould any
approach to activism to fit within the narrow context of the Peace Process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The right of the United States to effectively hold the world at bay to
determine the fate of the indigenous people of Palestine is not challenged.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two things should be recognized at this point; one, because of perceived
national interests in the Middle East, voter pressure is unlikely to impact policy; and
two, these perceived interests utterly disqualify the United States from participation in
any negotiations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While we must recognize that the position of the international community
may have less to do with genuine sympathy for the Palestinians and more to do with their
comparative lack of strategic interest in the Middle East (as the world&#146;s biggest
energy consumer and owner of the largest oil companies in the world, the U.S. certainly
has more at stake), nevertheless, for the time being, it would be in the
Palestinians&#146; interest to emphasize the internationalization of their cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is less important that the American public become sympathetic with the
Palestinians and more important that they become aware of the extent to which the U.S. is
out of step with the rest of the planet, including, of course, the world&#146;s more than
one and a half billion Muslims.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">A Peace of Genocide!</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</strong></i></p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Its origins</b></u><br>
Whether it was hatched in New York on the fringes of the United Nations Millennium summit
or in Tel Aviv may never be known. What is certain is that a decision was taken at the
highest level to turn up the political and military pressure on the Palestinian people to
deliver Jerusalem, sooner rather than later. The rehabilitation of Ariel Sharon was
evidently the preferred means to ignite the fires of war. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike previous occasions, Israel&#146;s latest genocidal campaign was
not directed against the refugee camps. Instead, Al Aqsa Mosque&#150;the third holiest of
Islamic sanctuaries&#150;became the target of Israeli sacrilege, following weeks of open
threats by the U.S. to transfer its embassy to Jerusalem. By so doing, both the American
and Israeli occupiers have miscalculated as they did in 1982. On this occasion, they have
committed a far more serious error by starting a conflict with the Islamic world. This
surely is a turning-point.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though overshadowed by the Aqsa Intifadah (uprising), the mid-September
rallies for Palestinian return were also an indicator of things to come: that Palestinian
and international resentment with Israeli abuse had certain fixed limits. Just as they had
done in the past, the Palestinian people have shown that they are fully capable and ever
willing to make the ultimate sacrifices for their national and religious rights over
Jerusalem. Those who gathered in New York and doubted these facts did not have to wait
very long for the evidence. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the Zionists&#146; absolute control of American Middle Eastern
policy, it was expected that the earlier meetings between Messers Clinton, Arafat and
Barak would collapse on the issues of Jerusalem and the right of return. And, with the
American dominance over the United Nations, the New York Summit was, by extension, also
doomed to failure insofar as Palestinian rights were concerned. In fact, the script was
already written long before the delegates arrived: that there would be no public debate or
statement on these issues. On the contrary, the immediate objective was to increase the
international pressure upon the Palestinian leadership to postpone, yet again, the
declaration of independence. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Palestinian failure to make diplomatic headway at the summit contrasted
markedly with the rewards extended to the Jewish State, presumably for its exceptional
record in brutality and aggression. Israeli diplomatic sources celebrated its
achievements, citing its reduction of the chances of mobilizing financial aid for the
Palestinian refugees when the U.S. Congress adjourned at the end of September. Likewise,
that it forced Mr. Arafat to postpone the declaration of a State, and removed from the
negotiating agenda the issue of Israel&#146;s third &#147;redeployment&#148; in the West
Bank. That being the case, it is argued that the most important diplomatic blow struck by
the Jewish State during the event came when the UN asked the Peres Center for Peace to
serve as a model for peace-building around the world!</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In cold blood</b></u><br>
The international body must now be ashamed for this senseless charade. That it allowed
itself to be so blinded and misled was inexcusable and disgraceful, especially when
isolated doves within the Israeli establishment were deploring national policies toward
the Palestinians. Gideon Levy is a notable example. He wrote in the 17 September issue of <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i>
that &#147;At a time when the Prime Minister is bringing up very daring ideas in the
negotiations with the Palestinians, and especially insisting on defining the &#145;end of
the conflict,&#146; his government and its institutions are sticking to a policy toward
the Palestinians which is so cruel that it raises great doubts as to the purity of the
government&#146;s intentions.&#148; Many of these doubts concern the disappearance and
extra-judicial killing of more than 100 Palestinian Arab youths in al-Lad and al-Ramleh in
recent months.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world leaders and diplomats who perhaps never heard of these
killings did not have to wait very long for the evidence. By the end of the month, they
were given a shocking reminder of the true nature, attitude and intent of the Jewish State
towards the world&#146;s Muslim and Christian peoples. The European governments, which for
the past decade claimed that there was &#147;no other game in town&#148; except the Oslo
peace process, saw how America stubbornly refused to condemn Israel&#146;s latest
atrocities in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was not a whiff of censure for the Occupying Power as it rained
missiles from helicopter gun-ships upon civilians in their homes and places of worship.
The free world was taught a lesson in Israeli brutality as it watched upon its television
screens the cold-blooded murder of 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durra while he was seeking
shelter in the arms of his defenceless father. No one called for the trial of those who
gave the soldiers the orders to commit these bestial acts. Not even Mr. Clinton for all
his eloquence could muster the words to condemn this outrage, except to describe it as
disturbing. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, in the face of this inhuman and excessive use of
unprovoked violence, Arab leaders continue to pledge their commitment to the &#147;peace
process.&#148; While they cower and wallow in the valley of fear, their valiant youth die
in the sands in a war between unequal forces. Today, their angry and frustrated people are
asking whether the American &#147;peace process&#148; has become more sacred to their
leaders than Al Aqsa Mosque or the blood of their children. They are appalled that their
leaders could still put their faith and trust in a mediator that gave its word of honour
in its Letter of Assurances to the Palestinians in October 1991. That it &#147;will
continue to oppose settlement activity in the territories occupied in 1967.&#148; That
same mediator today arms and enables Israel to disburse millions of dollars annually to
protect 22 settler families in the occupied Gaza Strip. So again they ask who will drink
from the Dead Sea when Israel continues to rob the Palestinian people of 490 million cubic
metres of subterranean water from a total 600 million cubic metres pumped annually from
the occupied West Bank? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the free world and Arab leadership was afraid to risk the loss of
American friendship, the popular support for the Aqsa intifadah was indelible proof of the
commitment and determination of their masses. The declarations by religious, trade union,
student and professional leaders from Rabat to Jakarta have sounded a common note in the
corridors of power: that if the Palestinian-Israeli conflict cannot be resolved through
the application of international law, the implementation of its resolutions, and respect
for the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Palestinian people, then there was no
lack of volunteers to settle it on the streets. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Intifadah and return</b></u><br>
The Aqsa intifadah has reaffirmed that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict entails much more
than a few political differences that can be ironed out at secret meetings and
negotiations. It involves above all the national right of the Palestinians to return
&#147;to their homes from which they have been uprooted&#148; in Israel. There is only one
true understanding and interpretation of the right of return; it is the one that secures
for the refugees the restitution of their stolen property and freedom to develop their
land collectively &#147;without external interference.&#148; It guarantees them the
freedom to establish their national capital in Jerusalem and maintain their custodianship
over its religious sanctuaries. Without this understanding and exercise of the right of
return, the &#147;closing of the conflict&#148; and attainment of peace would not be
realized&#150;not even with a military withdrawal from the West Bank as did occur in the
Egyptian Sinai. Indeed, the withdrawal from the West Bank is far worse today as the
occupying forces leave behind anti-personnel mines and other forms of lethal weaponry that
are outlawed internationally. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the full and absolute meaning of the right of return to which
Count Folke Bernadotte called and for which he was killed in September1948. It is the same
right that Palestinians are living and dying for presently. Though rooted in international
law and resolutions (UN/3236), the free world is afraid to call for its implementation
because it strikes at the root and branch of the Jewish State. Professor Kurt Ren� Radley
observed, &#147;It is difficult to imagine how much closer the General Assembly could have
come to endorsing the destruction, in part or whole, of a member State.&#148;<sup>1</sup></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Aqsa intifadah has shown that the supporters of Oslo have neither
the moral strength nor the political will to pursue this objective. Having long run out of
stamina, their only remaining aim is to divide and break the will of the Palestinian
people. Hence, their frantic calls for a quick solution before &#147;time runs out.&#148;
Of course, time is fast running out for those whose prime concern is their personal
offices and reputations. But, for a nation that has suffered the injustice of a foreign
invasion, conquest and expulsion from their homeland, there can be no single opportunity
in their historic march to justice. What they cannot achieve today would be accomplished
tomorrow or thereafter by another generation. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The love of war for the fun of it is truly inconsistent with human
nature and civilized conduct. It is abhorred because of the pain and destruction it
causes, both materially and psychologically. Yet, to the same degree, no people love to be
oppressed and denigrated. The Zionists who now trample upon the heads and bodies of
defenceless children in Palestine need no reminder of this. Oppression breeds anger and
hatred not only toward the oppressor but also toward those who aid and abet them. Thus,
when religious leaders in &#147;moderate and friendly&#148; Egypt could call for the
restoration by force of that which was taken by force, the world must know that a
fundamental shift has occurred in the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian people have given their verdict in the Aqsa intifadah.
They recorded it with the blood of their youth. They have given the clearest demonstration
yet in recent years of the way they want to go. They have made a historic choice
concerning the future. No one can question this. It is now up to the official Palestinian
and Arab leaderships to decide whether they want to be partners in shaping this future of
freedom and dignity or whether they prefer to remain partners in the peace of genocide! </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Aqsa intifadah has created many exceptional opportunities that must
be exploited. It has offered the Palestinian and Arab leadership a wide enough channel to
escape from the quagmire of Oslo. It has presented martyrs whose memory could only be
honoured with the restoration of the rights and options that were surrendered in Oslo. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Anatomy of Racism</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Hanan Ashrawi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Blaming the victim&#148; has been the common resort of the guilty in
rationalizing and distorting the horror of the crime itself. Whether battered wives,
abused children or Palestinians long subjected to the brutality of the horrendous Israeli
military occupation, the first (and last) resort of the cowardly is in maligning the
victim, in accusing him/her/them of having brought about the deserved cruelty of the
crime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The essential prerequisite, of course, is the total dehumanization of the
victims and the elimination of their most basic rights and attributes as well as claims to
protection. Inevitably, the resultant compound victimization is further enhanced by
increased vulnerability, distortion and exclusion from the protection of human
consideration and moral imperatives. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the latest eruption of confrontations between the Israeli
occupation army and civilian Palestinian protestors became the playing field for the full
force of the Israeli &#147;spin machine&#148; in a most deliberate, concentrated and
racist exercise of deception and dehumanization directed against a whole people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most basic form of deception is in fabricating a false symmetry
between occupier and occupied, between oppressor and victim. The &#147;violence&#148; of
the powerful Israeli occupation army using live ammunition, tanks and helicopter gunships
is (at best) equated with the &#147;violence&#148; of Palestinian civilians protesting
their victimization and continued loss of rights, lands and lives. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the Palestinians are called upon to be docile, to stop the
&#147;violence,&#148; to end the &#147;siege&#148; of Israel&#151;as though the strongest
army in the region is being &#147;threatened&#148; by the unarmed people&#146;s rejection
of its occupation and brutality. The obvious and simple solution, of course, is to
withdraw the army and end the occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, ironically, is accompanied by a devaluation of Palestinian rights
and lives by translating our objective weakness into a diminution of rights whereby the
powerful determines the parameters of &#147;justice&#148; for the weak. The whole
presentation constantly exhibits the &#147;white man&#146;s burden&#148; syndrome.
Palestinians should be &#147;grateful&#148; for whatever &#147;generous offer&#148; Israel
chooses to &#147;grant&#148; them, regardless of the glaring injustice and illegality of
the Israeli negotiating stance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both the extreme right and extreme left in Israel (as well as the U.S.)
have adopted this condescending, patronizing approach to peace&#151;Barak has gone the
&#147;farthest&#148; in &#147;offering&#148; the Palestinians almost 90% of their lands
with some &#147;responsibilities&#148; in Jerusalem, and those &#147;ungrateful&#148;
Palestinians are being &#147;intransigent&#148; and hard-line. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having compromised ourselves down to 22% of historical Palestine, we are
now being asked to be party to Israel&#146;s illegal annexation of Jerusalem and its
settlement policies&#151;i.e. an unholy partnership for the violation of international law
and the relevant UN resolutions. Should we be unwilling to self-negate, to refuse the role
of good little natives, and to continue rejecting the Israeli unilateral version of
&#147;peace&#148; that &#147;offers&#148; us a subservient State-let of isolated
Bantustans under Israel&#146;s apartheid system, then we will be pounded into submission. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After all, if pressure and threat and political arm-twisting do not work,
sheer naked military aggression can produce the desired results&#151;since &#147;Arabs
understand only the language of violence.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instant scare tactics or panic politics come into play with such labels as
the &#147;terrorist&#148; or &#147;dictatorial&#148; or &#147;violent&#148; Palestinians,
while depicting the reality of the Palestinian human will to resist subjugation and
oppression as proof of such misrepresentations. A catch-22 situation is clearly visible:
Arafat must &#147;control&#148; his people (nation of sheep?) and &#147;order&#148; them
to calm down and accept their enslavement and repression by the Israelis, otherwise he is
no longer a &#147;peace partner&#148; and cannot be considered a &#147;leader.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the same time, Israel cannot deal with Arafat or the Palestinians
because they are inherently &#147;undemocratic&#148; and therefore have nothing in common
with such &#147;civilized&#148; democracies as Israel and the U.S. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In parallel, other ready-made labels and stereotypical epithets are easily
pulled out as a convenient branding exercise to reduce the humanity of the Palestinians.
The historical and familiar slurs used by Israeli officials and public figures (including
cockroaches, two-legged vermin, dogs) have been expanded to include &#147;snakes&#148; and
&#147;crocodiles.&#148; The reduction of our humanity to a series of abstractions is
nowhere as sinister as in the numerical game. Palestinian victims of Israeli live fire are
daily given as &#147;x&#148; numbers killed and &#147;y&#148; numbers wounded. Their
names, identities, dashed hopes and shattered dreams are nowhere mentioned. Absent, too,
are the grief and anguish of their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and other loved
ones who will have to live with that tragic loss. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The visual documentation of the cold-blooded murder of the child Muhammad
al-Durra shattered the complacency of those who had been comfortable with the anonymity of
the Palestinians and the invisibility of their suffering. Even then, the Israeli
propaganda machine tried to distort the truth even in the face of irrefutable evidence.
First, it was said that he was killed by Palestinian &#147;gun men.&#148; Then, he was
&#147;caught in the crossfire.&#148; The worst version was in the cynical depiction of the
child Muhammad as a &#147;trouble-maker&#148; or a &#147;mischievous&#148; child who
brought it upon himself&#151;as though the proper response to a child living his childhood
is deliberate death. The last accusation involved a question: &#147;What was he doing
there?&#148; The real question should have been &#147;what was the Israeli army doing
there&#148; in the heart of Palestinian Gaza shooting at civilians, including a child and
his father who had been caught red-handed attempting to indulge in the
&#147;provocative&#148; act of shopping together. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Note the difference, however, when two Israeli undercover agents,
belonging to the notorious Israeli death squads, were killed by Palestinian protestors. No
Palestinian attempted to justify the act. Rather, orders were issued to investigate and
arrest those responsible. After all, there should be such a thing as the rule of law and
due process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, Israel moved its tanks and armies even closer to tighten the
siege and strangulation of Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps. Then it brought
in its Apache helicopter gunships and shelled Palestinian cities and towns in a most
senseless and cruel form of collective punishment. Its version of events presented the
Israeli agents as reservists who had mistakenly &#147;strayed&#148; into Ramallah and then
were &#147;lynched&#148; by the mob. References to &#147;slaughter&#148; and &#147;blood
thirst&#148; and &#147;savagery&#148; became the prevalent verbal currency. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While no one would condone the killing of the soldiers, it is important,
however, to deal with the real facts and the context: Ramallah, as a city under total
Israeli military siege, was closed off to all movement in or out of the city. Only one
entrance was open, entirely under the control of multiple Israeli military checkpoints.
Thus to &#147;stray&#148; into Ramallah would require deliberate and repeated attempts
requiring tenacity, persistence and even guile. The two Israeli agents were clearly
infiltrated and planted into the midst of a protest march in the heart of the city. The
occasion was the funeral of a Palestinian man, Issam Joudeh Hamad, from the village of Umm
Safa, who had been abducted by Israeli settlers and tortured to death in a most grisly
manner. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gruesome footage and photographs of the body, plus the testimony of the
doctors who had examined it, were not repeatedly displayed before the eyes of the world
for the sake of scoring points or dehumanizing the Israelis. Some Arab stations informed
me that the images were so horrific that they refrained from using them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the people participating in the march (in the besieged Palestinian
city of Ramallah) knew the victim, and some had seen the body. The two undercover Israeli
agents that had infiltrated the march were recognized by the Palestinians as members of
the &#147;Death Squads&#148; that had been responsible for assassinations and
provocations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the fact that the Palestinian police tried to protect them, the
two were killed before the cameras. This immediately became an instant justification for
branding all Palestinians as murderers, and for the most systematic, venomous, hate
campaign in recent history. It was also used as a justification for the Israeli aerial
attacks on Ramallah and other Palestinian cities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his moving appeal to his compatriots (13 October 2000) not to exploit
this incident to justify existing racism and hatred, Israeli poet Yitzhak Laor documents
several lynchings of Palestinians by Israeli army and security forces. In all cases the
perpetrators were never punished, and no moral outrage was expressed by the Israeli
public, let alone a shelling of Israeli cities! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same applies to the Israeli settler reign of terror that targets
Palestinians in their own homes and towns, with full Israeli military protection and
collusion. Presented as helpless &#147;Israeli civilians&#148; surrounded by
&#147;hostile&#148; Palestinians, the sinister and lethal nature of settler violence, as
armed extremists on the rampage, is often ignored. The illegality of Israeli settlements,
the fundamentalist extremist character of the armed settlers, and the horrific acts of
abduction, torture, killing and just plain random violence that are committed with
impunity&#151;rarely get a mention. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout all this, the Palestinians continue to be blamed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most blatantly racist slur is the Israeli theft of our humanity as
parents. In an attempt to rob us of our most basic feelings for our children, we are
accused of &#147;sending [our] children out to die&#148; for the sake of &#147;scoring
media points.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The horror is further compounded by the total and unquestioning equanimity
with which such a grand national slur is repeated by Israelis of all parties, with no
critical distance or even awareness of the enormity of such a racist charge. When
Palestinian children became targets for Israeli snipers and other army violence, the
ministry of education had no option but to close down the schools temporarily in order to
minimize the students&#146; exposure on the way to and from school. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That was immediately latched on to by the Israeli spin machine as proof
that we closed down the schools in order to &#147;release&#148; our children to go out and
&#147;riot&#148;, thereby obstructing the free path of Israeli bullets. The safety of home
and parents&#146; attempts at protecting their children are not even considered. Actually,
the 18-month-old baby girl, Sara Abdel-Athim Hassan, was shot in the back seat of her
father&#146;s car, while other child victims were killed in or around their own homes.
Mu&#146;ayyad al-Jawarish, 12 years old, was shot in the garden of his own home. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most children were shot in the head or upper part of the body, mainly with
high velocity bullets. The most common targets of rubber-coated steel bullets were the
eyes of children. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A shoot-to-kill (or permanently impair) policy has been in force by the
Israeli army&#151;claiming the lives of more than 105 Palestinians and wounding more than
3,000 (many of whom sustained permanent injuries). Israeli officials claim that they had
exercised &#147;restraint.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course they can do worse&#151;they can commit genocide or complete the
ethnic cleansing begun in 1948. Still, it is Israeli &#147;security&#148; that is at
stake. Israel&#146;s powerful army of occupation cowers in fear at the Palestinian
people&#146;s cry for justice and freedom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian people have no need for security on their own land or in
their own homes since they have been thoroughly dehumanized by their oppressor as to
deserve whatever happens to them. Worse than being &#147;non-existent&#148; (as in the
myth of the &#147;land without a people for a people without a land&#148;&#151;which even
Shimon Peres now seems to espouse), in the minds of the official Israeli narrative, we now
seem to be existent on a lower plain as sub-human species, bereft of the most elemental
qualities and rights that guide the conscience and moral values of humanity as a whole. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All this is for the sake of alleviating the guilt and responsibility of
the real culprit. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apologists for the Israeli occupation must find an alternative address to
be blamed for the horror inflicted on the Palestinians&#151;so who better than the victims
themselves? </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Baig</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 28 September 2000, extremist Israeli leader Ariel Sharon, accompanied
by thousands of fully armed Israeli soldiers provided by the government of
&#147;moderate&#148; Prime Minister Ehud Barak, invaded Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Muslim house
of worship&#150;the third holiest site in Islam&#150;was off limits to the worshippers
while the Jewish terrorist and his army roamed there and trampled it under their boots. As
the calculated provocation generated expected protests, Israeli shock troops and snipers
trained their weapons on the unarmed protestors, killing, blinding, maiming and
torturing&#150;the same way they have been doing ever since they set foot in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Actually, this time they increased their level of brutality using tanks,
missiles, banned dum-dum bullets and heavy weapons to silence the unarmed protestors. They
also provided escorts to armed Jewish lynch mobs as they went on the rampage in
neighbourhoods of unarmed Palestinians. In the first two weeks, they savagely killed more
than 120, maimed thousands and destroyed property on a large scale in efforts to terrorize
and remind them that &#147;Israel is powerful.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was a major media story, and it was covered in detail. Hardly anyone
exposed to the media remained unaware of the events. An Online Time poll demonstrated
this. The respondents were asked who had a greater responsibility for spreading violence,
Israelis or Palestinians? Less than 1% said they had no opinion. One day after the polling
started, 71% blamed Palestinians. Two days later, the ratio had changed, yet a majority
(54%) blamed Palestinians while only 45% found fault with the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poll continued at the time of this writing and the final numbers may
be different, yet the underlying points remain valid: media polls, whether scientific or
the online unscientific variety, reflect the job the media have done in shaping public
opinion. How could anyone who had seen the massacres, the lynching of Palestinians, the
shooting of steel bullets in the eyes and the cold-blooded murder of young children blame
the victims? Simple.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">People were simply reflecting what they had understood about the
&#147;complex Middle East problem.&#148; Welcome to the vast propaganda machine, the
mainstream media. It is probably the finest propaganda machine that ever has existed. It
is slick, very attractive and extremely deceptive. It tells lies with superb confidence.
And it kills with a smile on its face.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here is a look at the working of this media machine during the first two
weeks of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What happened?</b></u><br>
Here is the very first report about the event as carried by CNN:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;(CNN) - A visit by Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon to the site known
as the Temple Mount by Jews sparked a clash on Thursday between stone-throwing
Palestinians and Israeli troops, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd (28
September 2000, Web posted at 9:28 a.m. EDT [1328 GMT]).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">See how benign it is? Ariel Sharon is not the terrorist, extremist or the
mastermind of Sabra and Shatilla massacres that he is; he is just a respectable Israeli
politician. And what did he do? He visited a site known as Temple Mount. Not Al-Aqsa, not
the third holiest site in Islam, not Haram Al-Shareef but the Temple Mount. Above all, he
just visited. He did not take any army of some thousand plus soldiers and entered a Muslim
holy site. How can any reasonable person find fault with an Israeli leader visiting a
Jewish holy site? To him, the protestors would appear to be unfair or crazy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This was representative of things to come. Most media reports did not use
the name Al-Aqsa. The following statement from BBC was the most generous: &#147;Hundreds
of people have been injured in the clashes, which began on Thursday after a visit by the
right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to the holy site in Jerusalem which is revered
by both Muslims and Jews.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, the place was firmly established as a Jewish site or, at most, as a
Jewish site contested by Muslims as well.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Is it that these multi-million dollar media establishments did not know
the name Al-Aqsa or had no way of finding out about it? If you believe that, then you
might also believe that the British leaders who were laying the foundation of this trouble
in 1917 did not know that Muslims lived in Palestine. For, that is how that infamous
Balfour Declaration went: &#147;His Majesty&#146;s Government views with favour the
establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their
best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood
that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of
non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&#148; While the reference to the civil and religious
rights was just a window dressing, never meant to mean anything, it is important to note
that even here they were careful not to name Muslims, who are mentioned anonymously as
&#147;non-Jewish populations.&#148; At that time, Muslims constituted 92% of the
population of Palestine! Robbing their identity was the first step toward robbing their
land. And robbing the identity and history of Al-Aqsa is the propaganda machine&#146;s
method of paving the way for converting it into the Temple Mount!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This treatment also implies that the Muslim and Jewish claims are on equal
footing. Little would their audiences realize that Al-Aqsa mosque has been there for the
last fourteen centuries. Or that the Jewish claim, based on ancient history, is
unprecedented in the history of land claims. For if the underlying principle is accepted,
then, long before this claim is addressed, Americans will have to vacate all of their land
and give it back to the children of local Indians from whom it was appropriated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, it is important to remember that the entire Haram complex is
internationally recognized as an Islamic Waqf property. In 1930, during the Al-Buraq Wall
(now commonly mentioned as the Wailing Wall) riots, the British mandate forces appointed a
committee to investigate and decide the ownership of the Wall. The committee carried out
several investigations resulting in the Islamic identity of the Wall, which was considered
as part of the Islamic property (Awqaf), including the pavement and Al Magharbeh area, as
charitable possessions. It is this internationally recognized Islamic Waqf property and
the third holiest site in Islam (that has been standing there for the past fourteen
centuries), and not an obscure and controversial site that was violated by Sharon and
Israeli troops. Sharon desecrated Al-Aqsa, not visited the Temple Mount!</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Previous warning</b></u><br>
A crucial fact related to Sharon&#146;s provocation was that it had been previously
announced and that Palestinian leaders had warned about its consequences a day in advance.
The Israeli government decided to ignore these warnings and provide the military escort
for this adventure anyway.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While this warning was mentioned by the Associated Press on 27 September,
it was never referred to again. Why? Because if a person has been warned about the
provocative nature of his act and he still carries it out, then it is obviously an
intentional provocation. But that is not the truth that the media machine wanted to let
out.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fighting?</b></u><br>
Equally clever was the depiction of the protests as &#147;fighting.&#148; This legitimized
Israeli brutality, as in fighting people do get killed and wounded. Imagine what would
have been the impact if the propaganda machine had referred to that over-publicized event
as Tiananmen Square fighting. Why was that a massacre and this is fighting? Because the
propaganda machine chooses its words very carefully!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The depiction of protesting as fighting has another beneficial result: it
allows presenting the barbarity and brutality as a sign of strength and bravery. In fact,
at least one callous radio commentator in the U.S. made fun of the poor fighting skills of
the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This distortion was further reinforced through the repeated use of such
terms as &#147;cease-fire&#148; and appeals to both parties to &#147;end violence.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One example of this myth of proportionality was a report in the <i>LA
Times</i> (14 October 2000) that purported to be balanced and objective. But it is a
strange way of achieving balance: &#147;As helicopters circle overhead and the two sides
hurl rocks at each other on the ground, the veneer of civility is being stripped
away.&#148; The two sides hurling rocks at each other? Since when did the tear gas shells,
the lethal steel bullets, the live ammunitions and the missiles metamorphose into rocks?</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Looking the other way</b></u><br>
Propaganda consists of exaggerating some facts, distorting others and hiding or minimizing
still others. All of these techniques have been employed in this case. Israel&#146;s use
of banned dum-dum bullets was not mentioned. The lethal steel bullets, with a thin rubber
coating, were mentioned as rubber bullets. The new savage practice of targeting the eyes
of protestors, thereby blinding dozens of young people, was never reported. All hell would
have broken loose if a fraction of these acts had been performed by the other side.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As mobs of armed Jewish settlers rampaged through Palestinian homes
shouting &#147;Death to Arabs&#148; and looting, burning, killing, torturing and lynching
in the name of their God-given rights, the media machine just looked the other way. There
were more important things to report, like the admonitions of Kofi Annan to Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When, occasionally, and much later, these acts were mentioned, it was done
as complaints from Palestinians (who the audiences had already been prepared not to trust)
and not as reporter&#146;s own observations. Of course, the use of a term like Jewish
terrorism would be clearly unthinkable. So would be features analyzing the hatred and
animosity in the hearts of those who carried out such despicable acts in the name of God.
So would be the reports depicting the true nature of Zionist occupation and the virtual
slavery into which the Palestinians are being forced in the name of peace.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The International Community</b></u><br>
The &#147;international community&#148; had a limited but essential role. It was used to
legitimize its existence in 1948. That is when the United Nations affirmed the Balfour
Declaration and through its partition plan granted 56% of the land of Palestine to Israel
when the Jews owned only 5.7% of the land. Who gave them the right to award land like
this? Nobody has ever answered.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since then, the role of the UN has been simply to occasionally pass
resolutions that may make some Palestinians feel good, without delivering anything. The
latest Security Council resolution is an example. It was a vague, watered-down resolution
that aimed to deliver nothing. Yet, for whatever little it did say by deploring
&#147;excessive use of force&#148; (massacres are excessive use of force?), Israelis were
quick to reject it without fear that they would be accused of defying the will of the
international community or thumbing their nose at it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It happened that we survived the harsh language of the UN many times
in the past,&#148; said Avraham Burg, the speaker of the Israeli parliament. &#147;If they
want to continue with their rhetoric, it&#146;s beautiful, it&#146;s no problem, but at
some point it will become irrelevant.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are living under the New World Order where might is right and the
propaganda machine creates the truths and facts to serve the cause of that right. It is
incessantly entertaining, but it is also deadly. The least we can do is to realize the
nature of that machine and open our eyes.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Jewish settlers: Non-Jews are animals in human
form</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Samah Jaber*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the horror that faces us daily in the West Bank, the following are
excerpts from some of the interviews heard on television. Said one Israeli settler when
asked how he felt about the death of 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durra, a Palestinian boy in
Gaza, he said, &#147;Our kids are the kids of God; theirs are the kids of Satan.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another Jewish settler reflecting on Muhammad al-Durra&#146;s death said
with &#147;motherly&#148; passion, &#147;They [Palestinians] are not humans...they are
animals. In a way, those Palestinians aren&#146;t even animals. Animals care for their
offspring. Palestinians send their children out to kill or be killed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Evidently, she did not know that Muhammad&#146;s father had come to usher
him as far away from the violence and the war as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was Israeli soldiers who trained their guns on the man and the boy,
neither of which were carrying stones or weapons of any sort.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps this settler had not heard that the ambulance driver who came to
help the injured was killed too. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These medics did not have stones to throw, but they all had mothers just
like Israeli soldiers and every man, woman or child killed in this endless catastrophe of
ours.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Palestinians are fatalists. They are poor and have too many
children. They lack democracy and peace education. They are willing to send their children
out to riot just to get international attention and pressure the government of Israel. It
is sad that they get killed, but this is what it takes to stop violence against
Israelis,&#148; said a more moderate, so-called secular Jewish Israeli on television.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Can you imagine how most Jewish people in New York City would react if
anyone publicly or even privately said such things about them? Even non-Jews in the U.S.
who welcome those of Jewish faith, but do not agree with Zionist principles, are harshly
labelled anti-Semitic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Should a non-Jewish American dare speak out against the behaviour of
Israeli Jews, Jewish rebuttal is swift and harsh. Jobs can be lost, positions in a
community degraded, political careers demolished&#150;all for a suggestion, a word, or a
story that implies something negative about an Israeli or the State of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, most Americans look away and choose not to see how Israel treats the
Palestinians. Most Americans know little about the Muslim faith anyway. It&#146;s easier
to dismiss the Arabs than to search out the truth and possibly face Jewish reaction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Americans do not even know that there are Christian Arabs or that
&#145;Jihad&#146; more often than not means struggle within oneself and that both Jews and
Arabs are Semitic peoples.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It should be stated clearly that as Palestinians we do not send our
children out to die.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like every parent around the world, Palestinians want the best life for
their children. I was a child during the years of the Intifada (1987 to 1994). I remember
how romantic the idea of running along throwing stones seemed to me then.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When I&#146;d see my friends getting together to demonstrate, I&#146;d
have a spontaneous rush of desire to join in the &#147;fun.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Kids everywhere think they are immortal. At that time, so did we
Palestinian kids. None of us could quite believe that anything would happen to us. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, our parents knew. My parents used everything they could think of to
keep me and the other youngsters in our family inside. They kept us busy studying and
doing chores so that we couldn&#146;t go out to throw stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes things are out of a parent&#146;s control. The majority of the
children raised in Gaza or the West Bank after 1948 were denied a decent life by the
Israelis. Many were brought up in a state of poverty with no hope of better opportunities
ahead. Most of our &#147;camp&#148; children&#146;s fathers hung their heads and trudged
off to work for substandard wages paid by the Israelis. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The world should know by now that the most dangerous people in the world
are those who have nothing to live for. Many young Palestinians fit that category. For
many young Palestinians, challenging fully armed Israeli soldiers guarantees a feeling of
freedom and power. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;If we cannot be equal in life,&#148; someone said to me, &#147;we
will be in death. Whether it&#146;s us or them, the dead leave behind a shell and then our
faith will bring us a new life.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">People from the Mediterranean area, particularly Arabs, are famous for
their sense of passion and emotion. We are romantic souls with plenty of sentimental
poetry to prove it. We are less prone to wait before we act, but we are not stupid or
violent. We have a strong appreciation for democracy and peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maturity does bring with it hesitation and suppression of unseemly
feeling. We have waited since 1948 for the Israelis and the world to see what good they
have to offer. Sadly, nations seem blind to what has happened and readily turn away from
the reality of our plight.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our kids are angry from the very depths of their beings. Intellectually
and emotionally, they know very little beyond oppression. They&#146;ve grown up in refugee
camps, had their homes demolished, and have seen their fathers and older brothers taken to
jail&#150;some returning so badly beaten, they cannot walk or speak.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, I knelt beside some injured people in the hospital and tried to
learn their stories, their histories. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I asked one middle-aged woman who was shot in the stomach, &#147;How did
that happen? Why were you on the street?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I was protecting my son,&#148; she answered.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Then you gave birth to your child twice,&#148; I said, &#147;for he
is going to live.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am a Palestinian, and I&#146;ve seen that we are faithful believers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We believe in our right to live on our own land. We want to live and let
live, but we will not lie down or wait in line to be killed. We have waited long enough. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, by now, I know that Israelis kill our kids deliberately to break our
hearts and bring our nation to its knees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I do not want to mourn over the body of another Palestinian youth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, if I must, I know these children will unite with the earth of
Palestine, providing hydrocarbons and nutrition to our red soil. Our lemon trees will
grow, our gnarled olive trees will bend as mothers over our dead, and our bonds with the
place where we were born will live on forever.</p>

<i><b>

<p ALIGN="center">Edward Said</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Misreported and hopelessly flawed from the start, the Oslo peace process
has entered its terminal phase of violent confrontation, disproportionate massive Israeli
repression, widespread Palestinian rebellion and great loss of life&#150;the vast majority
of it Palestinian. Ariel Sharon&#146;s visit to Haram al-Sharif on 28 September could not
have occurred without Ehud Barak&#146;s concurrence. How else could the paunchy old war
criminal have appeared there with a thousand soldiers guarding him? Barak&#146;s approval
rating rose from 20% to 50% after the visit, and the stage seems set for a national unity
government ready to be still more violent and repressive. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The portents of this disarray, however, were there from the 1993 start.
Labour and Likud leaders alike made no secret of the fact that Oslo was designed to
segregate the Palestinians in non-contiguous enclaves, surrounded by Israeli-controlled
borders, with settlements and settlement roads punctuating and essentially violating the
territories&#146; integrity, expropriations and house demolitions proceeding inexorably
through the Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu and Barak administrations along with the expansion and
multiplication of settlements (200,000 Israeli Jews added to Jerusalem, 200,000 more in
Gaza and the West Bank), military occupation continuing and every tiny step taken toward
Palestinian sovereignty&#150;including agreements to withdraw in minuscule, agreed-upon
phases&#150;stymied, delayed and cancelled at Israel&#146;s will. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This method was politically and strategically absurd, even suicidal.
Occupied East Jerusalem was placed out of bounds by a bellicose Israeli campaign to decree
the intractably divided city off limits to Palestinians and to claim it as Israel&#146;s
&#145;eternal, undivided capital.&#146; The 4 million Palestinian refugees&#150;now the
largest and longest existing such population anywhere&#150;were told that they could
forget about any idea of return or compensation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With his own corrupt and stupidly repressive regime supported both by
Israel&#146;s Mossad and the CIA, Yasser Arafat continued to rely on United States
mediation, even though the U.S. peace team was dominated by former Israeli lobby officials
and a president whose ideas about the Middle East were those of a Christian fundamentalist
Zionist with no exposure to or understanding of the Arab-Islamic world. Compliant, but
isolated and unpopular Arab chiefs (especially Egypt&#146;s President Mubarak) were
compelled humiliatingly to toe the American line, thereby further diminishing their eroded
credibility at home. Israel&#146;s priorities were always put first, as was its bottomless
insecurity and its preposterous demands. No attempt was made to address the fundamental
injustice done when Palestinians as a people were dispossessed in 1948. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Behind the peace process were two unchanging Israeli/American
presuppositions, both of them derived from a startling incomprehension of reality. First
was that given enough punishment and beatings over the years since 1948, Palestinians
would ultimately give up, accept the compromised compromises Arafat did in fact accept,
and call the whole Palestinian cause off, thereafter excusing Israel for everything it has
done. Thus, for example, the &#145;peace process&#146; gave no considered attention to
immense Palestinian losses of land and goods, none to the links between past dislocation
and present Statelessness, while as a nuclear power with a formidable military, Israel
nevertheless continued to claim the status of victim and demand restitution for genocidal
anti-Semitism in Europe. Incongruously, there has still been no official acknowledgement
of Israel&#146;s (by now amply documented) responsibility for the tragedy of 1948, even as
the U.S. went to war in Iraq and Kosovo on behalf of other refugees. But one can&#146;t
force people to forget, especially when the daily reality was seen by all Arabs as
endlessly reproducing the original injustice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, after seven years of steadily worsening economic and social
conditions for Palestinians everywhere, Israeli and American policy makers persisted
(stupidly, I think) in trumpeting their successes, excluding the United Nations and other
interested parties, bending the disgracefully partisan media to their wills, distorting
the actuality into ephemeral victories for &#145;peace.&#146; With the entire Arab world
up in arms over Israeli helicopter gunships and heavy artillery demolishing Palestinian
civilian buildings, with more than 100 fatalities and approximately 5,000 wounded
(including many children) and with Palestinian Israelis up in arms against their treatment
as third-class, non-Jewish citizens, the misaligned and skewed status quo is falling
apart. Isolated in the UN and unloved everywhere in the Arab world as Israel&#146;s
unconditional champion, the U.S. and its lame duck president have little to contribute
anymore. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Neither do the Arab and Israeli leadership, even though they are likely to
cobble together another interim agreement. Most shocking has been the total silence of the
Zionist peace camp in the U.S., Europe and Israel. The slaughter of Palestinian youths
goes on and this band of supposed peace-lovers either backs Israeli brutality or expresses
disappointment at Palestinian ingratitude. Worst of all is the U.S. media, completely
cowed by the fearsome Israeli lobby, with commentators and anchors spinning distorted
reports about &#145;crossfire&#146; and &#145;Palestinian violence&#146; that eliminate
the fact that Israel is in military occupation and that Palestinians are fighting it, not
&#145;laying siege to Israel,&#146; as the ghastly Mrs. Albright put it. While the U.S.
celebrates the Serbian people&#146;s victory over Slobodan Milosevic, Clinton and his
minions refuse to see the Palestinian insurgency as the same kind of struggle against
injustice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My guess is that some of the new Palestinian intifada is directed at
Arafat, who has led his people astray with phony promises and maintained a battery of
corrupt officials holding down commercial monopolies even as they negotiate incompetently
and weakly on his behalf. Some 60% of the public budget is disbursed by Arafat to
bureaucracy and security, only 2% to the infrastructure. Three years ago, his own
accountants admitted to an annual $400 million in disappeared funds. His international
patrons accept this in the name of the &#145;peace process,&#146; certainly the most hated
phrase in the Palestinian lexicon today. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An alternative peace plan and leadership is slowly emerging among Israeli,
West Bank, Gaza and Diaspora Palestinians: no return to the Oslo framework; no compromise
on the original UN resolutions (242, 338 and 194) mandating the Madrid conference in 1991;
removal of all settlements and military roads; evacuation of all the territories annexed
or occupied in 1967; and boycott of Israeli goods and services.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">By the people, for the people</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Abdel-Jawwad Saleh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Intifada of Al-Aqsa ignited like wildfire. The Nero of Sabra and
Shatila, by entering the Haram Al-Sharif, was not on a &#147;mission for peace&#148; but
rather one of humiliation. He started the Intifada; yet Sharon&#146;s visit was not the
main cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new Intifada is the outcome of various measures and policies: the
unprecedented theft of Palestinian land; the construction of new colonies and the
expansion of existing ones; the demolition of Palestinian homes; and the collective
&#147;punishment&#148; of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA has played its part, too. In preserving Israeli security, it has
given no thought to Palestinian security as represented in the preservation of our
homeland. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&#150;these are the items on the
PA&#146;s daily list of things to do.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, its abuse of public finances and the spread of corruption
have given rise to resentment and lost the PA its last vestiges of credibility. Its role
in the negotiations is a symbol of its self-destruction. It has failed to fulfil its own
promises to its people. The PA promised that it would never enter the final-status
negotiations before Israel implemented the third phase of redeployment. Redeployment never
came about, and off the PA went to Camp David II all the same.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli and Palestinian policies have fed the flames of the Intifada. But
Sharon&#146;s visit, and the imminent danger to Jerusalem, were truly the tinder that set
the powder-keg ablaze.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Intifada is genuine; it has not been &#147;manipulated&#148; by
Arafat. It was a spontaneous explosion, an expression of unbearable frustration on the
part of a people who have been asked to bear far more than they should. The Palestinians
have sacrificed too much. We should respect their courage and willingness to keep on
fighting. The resistance should give us hope. The Palestinian people&#146;s resilience has
surprised its enemies and its friends alike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Young people look death in the face every morning. They have no weapons to
guard themselves against it. They run out, pockets filled with stones and hearts full of a
desperate, burning hope. They fall, wave after wave, in a hail of bullets. Yet more rise
from behind them and run forward to take their places. They are not implementing any
policy guidelines. On the contrary; the leadership&#146;s decisions stab them in the back.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian people have their own alternative agenda. Whether or not
the PA is coordinating its policy with Israel&#146;s demands, repression, accumulated
frustration and despair cannot remain inert forever. Fear of the threat to Jerusalem
triggered the explosion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Developments on the local, Arab and international scenes also created a
climate hospitable to a new Intifada. Locally, the Declaration of the Twenty was a
watershed that signalled the dangers confronting the Palestinian people and brought down
the barriers raised by fear of a confrontation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian university students, by supporting the Declaration, gave the
first indication that something was afoot. Later, their spontaneous protest against French
Prime Minister Jospin when he condemned the Lebanese resistance as terrorists was another
important sign.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the victory of Lebanese resistance, led by Hizbullah, and the eventual
withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon, were the last nails in the coffin of
Palestinian despair. Internationally, the anti-globalization movement has its own
repercussions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few days before the Intifada of Al-Aqsa, I was invited to attend a rally
in support of the Palestinian refugees&#146; right of return, attended by more than 4,000
participants from all over the United States. It was the largest rally the Palestinians
had ever held in the U.S. The organizers were independent young men and women. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Their homes were the campaign headquarters. To finance the gathering, they
depended on donations from private individuals&#150;Palestinians and other Arabs. I felt
optimistic and empowered; my faith in the young generation was enhanced.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our young people have defeated self-defeat, frustration and despair. Our
cause is in safe hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new Intifada&#146;s achievements are numerous. The people have risen
in revolt all over the Arab world, generalizing the Intifada for the first time, in
qualitative and quantitative terms, since the death of Gamal Abdel-Nasser. The nation has
rediscovered itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In conclusion, two points seem important. First, the PA leadership has not
changed its strategy or tactics. It will not abandon negotiations, although it is
abundantly clear that they can serve no purpose as long as they continue in the same way.
Still, Palestinians and Arabs should not surrender to despair, for the conclusion of the
negotiations will not end the conflict. There will be no just peace. We should be prepared
for the alternative.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, the Palestinians should examine the differences between the 1987
Intifada and this year&#146;s uprising. Why have almost all the victims been Palestinian
this time around? Why have so many died? Why have the settlers not been affected as they
were in 1987, when they deserted their colonies?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The answers to these questions seem clear.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">How a bloc vote will empower Muslims in America</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unlike the Jewish community of the U.S., Muslims in America have neither
money power nor media power.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslims in America, however, do have one weapon with which they can move
forward provided they unite to use it effectively: their vote.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is happening in Jerusalem and how U.S. leaders of both parties are
responding is only one of the latest examples of the weakness of 10 million Muslims and
Christian Arabs in America. It is an indication that the power of their vote, their
support and endorsement of a candidate as a group, a unified bloc, has been
underestimated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jews in America vote in a bloc at presidential elections; 70% to 75% of
votes in favour of one candidate are normally considered a bloc vote.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The current presidential election provides an extraordinary opportunity
for a community like ours to become a decisive factor in election results. If the Muslim
vote gets divided and entangled in domestic and foreign policy issues, no one will notice
that we voted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On all policy issues, there are millions of dollars spent on this, as well
as lobby groups with well-defined positions. Unless Muslims are empowered, no one will
care what our opinion is on this issue or that issue. So we must keep the policy debate or
even the personality debate, arguing over which party has a better policy or which
candidate is smarter, on the side.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What matters is what type of vote will empower the Muslim community to
become a player in the American political arena. Can future candidates rely on us to
support them as a group?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It has happened at the regional level in the past. I believe it can happen
at the national level as well.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How Muslims have used the power of the bloc vote in the past</b></u><br>
In the last seven to eight years, Muslim Americans have flexed their political muscles in
different constituencies. In New York, Pakistani taxi drivers organized an alignment and
campaigned to defeat Congressman Stephen J. Solarz.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The nine-term congressman was the most vocal leader of the Indian lobby in
Congress. He lost his congressional seat to some determined Pakistani activists who were
still learning the ropes of politics in the Big Apple.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They probably did not know that he was also the leading proponent of
Israeli interests on Capitol Hill. He was in line to be the Chair of the House Foreign
Relations committee.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although his campaign fund was greater than the aggregate of all five
opponents, he was defeated. The Pakistanis&#146; campaign against him paid off in favour
of one of the Spanish candidates in a newly constituted seat. That was 1992. The first
time, probably, any Muslim group made a successful effort in any U.S. election.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1996, Muslims in New Jersey endorsed Richard Zimmer, a Republican
candidate in an open Senate seat. But concerned about Jewish votes, Zimmer announced that
he did not ask for the Muslim community&#146;s endorsement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Upon hearing this, Muslims withdrew their endorsement and put their
support behind the Democratic candidate, Robert Torricelli. This candidate won the
elections with a slight margin and publicly acknowledged that his success was owing to the
support of the Muslim community. Now, when he speaks in the Senate, he is conscious of
Muslim concerns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslims in New Jersey continued to make good electoral choices through
their bloc votes. While doing that, they have effectively created a counter-voter bloc
upon which candidates can rely. Governor Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey is a regular
guest at Muslim events in New Jersey, of course with a scarf-covered head. Recently, New
Jersey was the first State in which Halal food laws were passed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gone are the days when, in 1984, Senator Charles Percy begged Muslims for
votes which never came. His opponent Paul Simon&#146;s campaign was essentially fueled by
millions of dollars donated by the Israeli lobby to defeat Senator Percy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Senator Charles Percy was the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign
Relations committee. He represented the State of Illinois in the U.S. Senate from 1967
through 1984. The only crime Percy committed was being a little sympathetic to
Palestinians and Pakistan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Senator Percy sent his family members to the Muslim Community in Chicago
for Muslim votes. Muslims didn&#146;t care at that time. Hardly anyone registered or
voted. Percy lost with only a few hundred votes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Who will dare to speak for a Muslim cause when punishment is so directly
related to their crime?</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Election 2000 and the Muslim bloc vote</b></u><br>
If, in the coming elections, America&#146;s close to 8 million Muslims and its close to 2
million Arab Christians mobilize to form a common agenda and vote as a bloc on a national
ticket, two things can happen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One, they will cause one party to win. Two, they will reduce the margin of
loss for the losing party. Either way, this decision is crucial for the empowerment of
Muslims at the national level.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Muslims vote as a bloc, they will show their power and strength.
Insha&#146;allah (if God wills), political candidates will understand and acknowledge that
Muslims and Arabs in America have come home. They are part of the playing field and they
will have to be taken very seriously. Perhaps even more seriously than the Jewish vote,
which is significantly smaller in terms of numbers.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Who should Muslims bloc vote for?</b></u><br>
At this moment, some Muslims support the social justice agenda of traditional Democrats,
along with their openness to immigrants.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Muslims support the Republicans&#146; conservatism on social issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Others, still, find Ralph Nader&#146;s Green Party has the best policies,
has an excellent record and provides them with the protest vote option.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But if Muslims&#146; voting choice is based solely on policy issues, then
our votes are bound to be divided. On the other hand, if the goal is to empower Muslims as
one voting bloc, then Muslims will have to look at which vote will get them recognition as
political players.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At this moment, the Jewish community, the media and the money are all on
the side of the Gore-Lieberman ticket. The Pro-Israeli political action committee&#146;s
(PAC) Year 2000 contribution to the Democrats&#146; presidential candidate Al Gore is
$151,890; to the Democrats&#146; vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, $226,508.
In contrast, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has only received $5,200 and
Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney, none.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1992, Bill Clinton got the support of 85% of Jewish voters because they
were angry at the pressure George Bush (father of the current Republican presidential
candidate) was putting on Israel to reach a land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1996, Bill Clinton got 88% of the Jewish vote against Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole because the Israeli press had labelled Clinton the most
pro-Israel president in U.S.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush knows this and is making a conscious effort to lure Muslim votes. And
that is the reason he opposed secret evidence and racial profiling being used against
Arab-Americans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, in the course of a presidential debate, Bush also contrasted Al
Gore&#146;s solid friendship of Israel with his friendship of Israel and friendly Arab
countries, namely Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If Muslim Americans and Arabs openly endorse the Bush-Cheney ticket, and
if we are able to deliver the votes that will either cause Bush and Cheney to win or will
reduce their margin of loss to smaller digits, America in general and politicians in
particular will note that Muslims have arrived. Let&#146;s translate anger over Palestine
into the power of our vote.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let&#146;s take the first major step in empowering Muslims in America.
Once we are counted, then our opinion on domestic policy and foreign policy will matter,
not before that.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I know that not all of Bush&#146;s policies on Muslim causes can be
supported. Whichever candidate is endorsed, it will involve sacrifice on the part of those
whose candidate is not chosen. If you vote as a bloc, you are not just voting for a
candidate or his policies, you are actually voting for your community.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Are Muslims capable of delivering a bloc vote?</b></u><br>
Yes. A bloc vote does not mean 100% of Muslim votes. If Muslims are able to deliver 60% to
70% of their votes to any candidate, that will be a milestone in the process of
empowerment of Muslims in America, whether that candidate wins or not.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It will be a test, however, of the Muslim leadership and its internal
communication system. The Muslim leadership is not united nor is Muslim communication
strong enough to announce a decision to all Muslim voters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, they are united in anger. Some of the largest demonstrations in
the history of Muslims in America are taking place in favour of Palestine today.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Political empowerment of Muslims is a long process. This election is an
important step in that direction, but it is in no way a solution to all of your worries.
The ability of national Muslim organizations to make a collective decision, to be able to
convey this to Muslims in America, and to be able to deliver a bloc vote is also going to
prove whether these organizations will be trusted by Muslim voters or politicians in
future or not.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What to do if you agree</b></u><br>
If you agree with the concept of the bloc vote to empower Muslims in America, you can do
the following:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. If you are a Muslim leader, call a meeting of Muslim opinion leaders in
your area to discuss the issue of a bloc vote and how to tell others about it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. If you are not a leader, invite one to your home, or visit him and
convince him to organize a bloc vote. There are many small organizations at the national
level who may announce collective or conflicting endorsements. But none of them have the
grass-roots contacts. Your informal decisions may make a difference. Some national
organizations are meeting during the last weekend of October to make an endorsement. They
met last year also but did not endorse anyone. It is important that these organizations
hear from you. Contact them with your opinion.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF"><em><small>Millennium, by Walther van der
Vogelweide (1170-1230)</small></em></font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><i>Dr. Mohamed Khodr</i></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The drums of war are escalating exponentially in the Middle East. With
Barak threatening massive force against the Palestinians within a 48-hour time period if
Arafat does not stop the protests, with Hizbullah capturing three Israeli soldiers in
occupied Lebanese territory, with Israeli forces moving toward southern Lebanon, and with
Palestinian casualties mounting daily, war as an alternative for Israel has replaced its
historical obligation to negotiate in good faith based on United Nations resolutions 242,
338, 476 and 478, all of which demand Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders and
return East Jerusalem to the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the Palestinians and Arabs, the absence of peace, justice and
acceptance of internationally mandated resolutions by Israel can only lead down the path
of politically, economically, and diplomatically isolating Israel, ultimately leading the
region to armed conflict. Barak, facing political extinction and humiliation, could start
a limited war to shore up his shaky standing. Blood has replaced money in Israeli
politics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is difficult to understand Israel&#146;s logic in not abiding by UN
resolutions that the United States supported. Why would Israel want to remain an occupying
military power, regularly condemned by the world&#150;with the sole exception being the
United States&#150;for its abhorrent treatment and human rights abuses of the
Palestinians? Why must it insist on embarrassing itself by living in the paradoxical
hypocritical identity of a democracy and military dictatorship?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PLO has met all of Israel&#146;s and America&#146;s demands. It has
recognized Israel&#146;s right to exist; it has amended its charter; it has accepted
Israel&#146;s occupation of 78% of their original land; it has accepted West Jerusalem as
Israel&#146;s capital; it has abandoned &#147;terrorism&#148;; It has accepted
Israel&#146;s annexation of illegal settlements on their land; It has accepted a limited
return of refugees out of the 5 million exiled Palestinians; it has developed shared
security arrangements&#150;even acting as Israel&#146;s enforcer and jailing its own
people&#150;it has accepted 400 armed religious militants in the middle of Hebron
protected by 2,000 soldiers; and much more. Yet, Israel, towing America along, kept moving
the bar, building more settlements, demolishing more homes, taking more prisoners,
confiscating more land, raising more checkpoints, limiting freedom of movement and
worship, all for the sake of 200,000 militant religious fanatics who mostly emigrate from
America. Despite all the peace agreements, delays, handshakes and last-minute crises, no
one in the world can truly express what is Israel&#146;s true intent and end-game in all
this diplomatic manoeuvring. The separated West Bank and Gaza constitute only 22% of
original Palestine. With scattered large modern settlements and a mosaic of roads, the
occupied territories appear physically afflicted with measles, an affliction till now that
has no treatment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nothing so corrupts humanity as power and might. Justice, if not divinely
inspired, becomes the crusade and obsession of the victim, not the victimizer. In the last
century, the Nazis used their economic, military and media propaganda to victimize and
almost exterminate an entire people of Torah believers. Many of these same tactics are now
used against the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For 52 years, Palestinians have suffered under the overwhelming economic
and military might of Israel. They lost their lives, land, homes and identity. Those
remaining in Palestine were herded into scattered refugee camps over 20% of their original
land while the remaining two thirds were expelled as refugees into neighbouring Arab
States. How can one rationalize such a paradox, such inhumanity and such injustice?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Might gives one the liberty to rewrite history, to fabricate lies as solid
truths, to transform victim to aggressor and aggressor to victim, to indoctrinate, to
institutionalize injustice as the normal reaction to perceived or real threats. Israel has
such might. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Israeli-Palestinian-Arab conflict, Israel has defeated the Arabs
militarily in all its wars, but more importantly, it has defeated the Arabs in the arena
of public opinion with the most sophisticated public relations campaign ever devised by a
nation and its supporters. The American Pro-Zionist media has successfully portrayed
Palestinians and Arabs as violent, untrustworthy, uncivilized beings who believe in a
bloodthirsty religion, Islam. In their book, <i>Wizards of Media Oz</i>, Norman Solomon
and Jeff Cohen state: &#147;In the world according to U.S. media, the high moral ground in
the Middle East belongs to Israel&#146;s government. In news coverage, Israel&#146;s
casualties are apt to have names, faces and bereaved relatives, while Arab victims are
likely to be fleeting images: nameless, faceless, distant&#133;Israel&#146;s most crucial
allies include the mass media of the United States&#133;Together with top officials in
Washington, news outlets keep reinforcing the assumption that the Israeli government can
do little wrong.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent killing of over 100 Palestinians and the wounding of more than
4,500 serves to illustrate the dichotomy of reporting by the U.S. and Israeli governments
and the American media as compared to Israel&#146;s media and independent organizations.
The official line in Israel and Washington, widely adopted in the American media, is that
Arafat instigated this violence and that the deaths occurred in &#147;crossfire&#148;
shooting. The <i>Washington Post</i> reported on 4 October that &#147;there is evidence to
support the claim by Israelis that the Palestinian leadership has orchestrated the
militia, as well as civilians and armed Palestinian police in the rioting.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Contrast this with the 5 October report issued by Israel&#146;s Internal
Security Forces, Shin Bet, and reported by <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i>, an Israeli paper. Shin
Bet states: &#147;nobody is directing the demonstrations in the Arab sector. The furor
erupted following the killing on the Temple Mount and has become a way to express general
frustration against the backdrop of the continued deadlock [in talks between Israel and
the Palestinians].&#148; It insists the riots were &#145;spontaneous&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America&#146;s Middle East foreign policy has been in shambles and an
embarrassment owing to America&#146;s one-sided support of Israel. Israel&#146;s continued
occupation of Arab land, its desecration of Islam&#146;s Haram al-Sharif, its abuse of
human rights, repeated invasions of Arab land and killing of civilians, and the
embarrassing U.S. vetoes, have led many in the Arab and Islamic world to question
America&#146;s neutrality and motives. Israel is jeopardizing America&#146;s peaceful
relations and economic trade, including oil, with the Islamic world, about one fifth of
the world&#146;s population. Israel has cost the American taxpayer $150 billion in aid
(30% of all our foreign aid to one country), has cost American lives owing to terrorism or
its attack on the USS Liberty ship, has corrupted America&#146;s political system and
media institutions, and has even led to Congressional funding of the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, DC, while denying funds for America&#146;s brave Second World War Veterans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his Farewell Address, George Washington admonished his nation to avoid
a &#147;passionate attachment&#148; to another nation that might create &#147;the illusion
of a common interest&#133;.where no common interests exist.&#148; This passionate
attachment to Israel may lead America to greater dangers in the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tal proceeded in his discussion to ask Amital a multi-faceted, serious
question: &quot;What is the point of all the affliction? Why do wars continue, if the
Messiah has already come and if the Kingdom of Israel has already been established?&quot;
Amital replied: &quot;The war initiates the process of purification, of refinement, the
purifying and cleaning of the congregation of Israel.&quot; Tal continued to discuss:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We thus learn that there is only one explanation of the wars: they
refine and purify the soul. As impurity is removed, the soul of Israel- by virtue of the
war - will be refined. We have already conquered the lands; all that now remains is to
conquer impurity.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The followers of the two Rabbi Kooks have applied the above concepts to
all other Israeli wars. Rabbi Shmaryahu Arieli, for example, explained, according to Tal,
that the 1967 war was a &quot;metaphysical transformation&quot; and that the Israeli
conquests transferred land from the power of Satan to the divine sphere. This supposedly
proved that the &quot;messianic era&quot; had arrived. Tal also quoted the teachings of
Rabbi E. Hadaya: &quot;[The conquests of 1967] liberated the land from the other side [a
polite name for Satan], from a mystical force that embodies evil, defilement and moral
corruption. We [the Jews] are thus entering an era in which absolute sovereignty rules
over corporeality.&quot; Tal emphasized that these statements constituted a warning that
any Israeli withdrawal from conquered areas would have metaphysical consequences that
could result in restoring to Satan sovereignty over that land. Other Gush Emunim leaders
directly and indirectly expressed the same ideas in their public statements and writings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There can be little doubt that Gush Emunim has seriously affected Israeli
Jewish religious leaders and lay people. During the time of the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, for example, the military rabbinate in Israel, clearly influenced by the ideas of
the two Rabbi Kooks, exhorted all Israeli soldiers to follow in the footsteps of Joshua
and to re-establish his divinely ordained conquest of the land of Israel. This exhortation
of conquest included extermination of non-Jewish inhabitants. The military rabbinate
published a map of Lebanon in which the names of Lebanese towns had been changed to the
names of cities found in the Book of Joshua. Beirut, for example, was changed to Be'erot.
The map designated Lebanon as land belonging to the ancient northern tribes of Israel,
Asher and Naphtali. As Tal wrote: &quot;Israel's military presence in Lebanon confirmed
the validity of the Biblical promise in Deuteronomy 11:24: 'Every place on which the sole
of your foot treads shall be yours; our border shall be from the wilderness, from the
river Euphrates, to the western sea.&quot;' The followers of the two Rabbis Kook viewed
Lebanon as being delivered from the power of Satan with its inhabitants being killed in
the process.&quot; Such a view is not exceptional; it has numerous ancient and modern
parallels, both religious and secular. The idea of a murderous purification of land from
the evil and defilement that provoke God is common. In her chapter, &quot;The Rites of
Violence,&quot; in the book, <i>Society and Culture in Early Modern France, </i>Natalie Z.
Davis, for example, presented the same idea as being the rationalization for the massacres
perpetrated by France in the second half of the sixteenth century. In his excellent book, <i>The
Pursuit of the Millennium, </i>to cite another example, Norman Cohn discussed Christian
religious movements that sought to bring about the millennium by the use of force
resulting in the deaths of many people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Three interpretative and interrelated comments about Tal's analysis of
Gush Emunim should be made. First, the rabbis, cited as authorities by both Tal and the
authors of this book, are not obscure or fringe rabbis but are important Israeli figures.
As previously noted, Shimon Peres, when prime minister, regarded one of them, Rabbi
Amital, as a moderate and appointed him minister without portfolio. Second, Tal was able
to comprehend the real essence of what he termed the &quot;political messianic
trend.&quot; His expertise in German Nazism, particularly in Nazi ideology and its
sources, almost certainly helped him in his study of Gush Emunim. (See Tal's book in
Hebrew, <i>Political Theology and the Third Reich, </i>Tel-Aviv University Press, 1989.)
The similarities between the Jewish political messianic trend and German Nazism are
glaring. The Gentiles are for the messianists what the Jews were for the Nazis. The hatred
for Western culture with its rational and democratic elements is common to both movements.
Finally, the extreme chauvinism of the messianists is directed towards all non Jews. The
1973 Yom Kippur War, for instance, was in Amital's view not directed against Egyptians,
Syrians and /or all Arabs but against all non-Jews. The war was thus directed against the
great majority of citizens of the United States, even though the United States aided
Israel in that war. This hatred of non-Jews is not new but, as already discussed, is
derived from a continuous Jewish cabbalistic tradition. Those Jewish scholars who have
attempted to hide this fact from non-Jews and even from many Jews have not only done a
disservice to scholarship; they have aided the growth of this Jewish analogue to German
Nazism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ideology of the Rabbis Kook is both eschatological and messianic. It
resembles in this respect prior Jewish religious doctrines as well as similar trends in
Christianity and Islam. This ideology assumes the imminent coming of the Messiah and
asserts that the Jews, aided by God, will thereafter triumph over the non-Jews and rule
over them forever. (This, it is alleged, will be good for the non-Jews.) All current
political developments will either help bring this about sooner or will postpone it.
Jewish sins, most particularly lack of faith, can postpone the coming of the Messiah. The
delay, however, will not be of long duration, because even the worst sins of the Jews
cannot alter the course of redemption. Sins can nevertheless increase the sufferings of
Jews prior to the redemption. The two world wars, the Holocaust and other calamitous
events of modem history are examples of punishment. The elder Rabbi Kook did not disguise
his joy over the loss of lives in World War I; he explained that loss of lives was
necessary &quot;in order to begin to break Satan's Power.&quot; The followers of the elder
Rabbi Kook's pronouncements often have detailed in depth such explanations. Rabbi Dov
Lior, one of the best-known rabbis of the aforementioned Gush Emunim rabbinical council
and the rabbi of Kiryat Arba, for instance, argued that Israel's failure in its 1982
invasion of Lebanon was due to the lack of faith manifested in the signing of the peace
treaty with Egypt and the returning of &quot;the inheritance of our ancestors [Sinai] to
strangers.&quot; Lor also explained in an article about him, published in the <i>Hadashot
Supplement </i>of December 20, 1991, that the capture by the Syrians of two Israeli
diplomats stationed in Junieh, Lebanon, in May 1984, was &quot;a just punishment for the
maltreatment in detention of our boys from the Jewish underground.&quot; In the <i>Hadashot
</i>article Lior added &quot;I do not know what sufferings can yet befall all the
Jews&quot; for this crime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Explanations that may appear to the uninitiated to be outlandish and
bizarre are sometimes the most readily acceptable to Gush Emunim followers. This is
especially the case when these followers believe redemption is near at hand. They believe
that Satan, as described in the Cabbala, is rational and well-versed in logic; they
believe further that the power of Satan and of his earthly manifestation, the non-Jews,
can at times only be broken by irrational action. Gush Emunim thus founded settlements on
the exact days of United States Secretary of States James Baker's recurrent arrivals in
Israel not merely to demonstrate Gush Emunim power but also as part of a mystical design
to break the power of Satan and its American incarnation. In the past, different Jewish
religious movements, for example, the movement of the false Messiah Shabtai Zvi in 1665
and 1666 and early Hassidism, had employed similar logic. Certain Christian and Islamic
movements also employed analogous logic at certain times.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gush Emunim ideologues, especially Rabbi Kook the elder, not only derived
their ideas largely from Jewish tradition but were also innovative. How they developed the
Messiah concept is illustrative. The Bible anticipated only a single Messiah. Jewish
mysticism anticipated two Messiahs. According to the Cabbala the two Messiahs will differ
in character. The first Messiah, a militant figure called &quot;son of Joseph,&quot; will
prepare the material preconditions for redemption. The second Messiah will be a spiritual
&quot;son of David&quot; who will redeem the world by spectacular miracle-making. (Gush
Emunim followers believe that miracles occur at various times.) The cabbalistic conception
is that the two Messiahs will be individuals. Rabbi Kook the elder altered this idea by
anticipating and advocating that the first Messiah will be a collective being. Kook
identified his group of followers as the collective &quot;son of Joseph.&quot; Gush Emunim
leaders, following the teaching of Rabbi Kook the elder, continue to perceive their
rabbis, and perhaps all followers as well, as the collective incarnation of at least one
and perhaps two divinely ordained Messiahs. Gush Emunim members believe that this idea
should not be revealed to the uninitiated until the right time. They believe further that
their sect cannot err because of its infallible divine guidance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabbi Kook's second innovation concerned the relationship of the first
Messiah to ignorant non-believing Jews, both secular and religious. Rabbi Kook derived
this concept from the biblical prophecy that the Messiah &quot;bringing salvation&quot;
will be &quot;riding upon an ass and upon a colt, the foal of an ass&quot; [Zechariah
9:9]. The Cabbala regarded this verse as evidence for two Messiahs: one riding upon an ass
and the other upon a colt. The question here was: How could a collective Messiah ride upon
a single ass? Kook answered the question by identifying the ass with Jews who lacked
wisdom and correct faith. Kook postulated that the collective Messiah would ride upon
these Jews. This meant that the Messiah would exploit them for material gains and would
redeem them to the extent that they could be redeemed. The idea of redemption through
contact with a spiritually potent personality has been a major theme common to all strands
of Jewish mysticism. It has been applied not only to humans and their sins but also to
animals and inanimate objects. In Israel this idea is still a part of religious education.
Popular books for religious children contain many stories that allegedly illustrate this
point. One of the most repeated stories is about a virtuous wild duck that is caught,
killed and made into a succulent dish for a holy rabbi. This duck is considered to be
redeemed by its being eaten by the holy man. The Gush Emunim innovation here has been to
apply this not only to non-believing Jews who are redeemed by following the collective
Messiah but also to all conceivable material objects, ranging from tanks to money.
Everything can be redeemed if touched or possessed by Jews, especially messianic Jews.
Gush Emunim members apply this doctrine to the conflict in the Holy Land. They argue that
what appears to be confiscation of Arab-owned land for subsequent settlement by Jews is in
reality not an act of stealing but one of sanctification. From their perspective the land
is redeemed by being transferred from the satanic to the divine sphere. Gush Emunim, so
its followers believe, is by virtue of exclusive access to the total and only truth more
important than the remainder of the Jewish people. Gush Emunim rabbis utilize the
following analogy of the messianic ass: given its lowly status in the hierarchy of beings,
the ass must remain ignorant of the noble purpose of its divinely inspired rider. This is
the case in spite of the fact that the ass surpasses the rider in size and sheer power.
The divine rider in this analogy leads the ass toward its own salvation. Because of his
noble purpose the rider may have to kick the ass during the course of the journey in order
to make sure that the ass does not stray from the ordained path. In the same way, the Gush
Emunim rabbis assert, this one messianic sect has to handle and lead the ass-like Jews,
who have been corrupted by satanic Western culture with its rationality and democracy and
who refuse to renounce their beastly habits and embrace the true faith. To further the
process, the use of force is permitted whenever necessary.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">While Some Children Die</font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>E. Yaghi</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On a fine autumn day, on a still-green soccer field somewhere in America,
golden and red leaves flutter to the ground like an unchained melody. I see children
shouting and playing in the sun, carefree and happy. It is such a fine autumn day that
instead of searching for the sun to warm me, I search for the shade to cool me. The
panorama of what stretches out before me is alive and vivid and full of a rainbow of
colours.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But as I sit watching, I can&#146;t help thinking of the scene I saw
earlier on TV where doctors in an emergency room somewhere in Occupied Palestine
frantically tried to save the life of a young Palestinian who was shot and seriously
wounded in a demonstration against Israeli soldiers. One well-built doctor began to revive
the youth by frantically pushing his hand down hard on the boy&#146;s chest and then
releasing it so he could keep his heart beating. But the doctor&#146;s angry battle to
save the life of the young martyr was hopeless. A crowd of other doctors and nurses
huddled around the body, doing everything they could to bring this child back to the woes
of his world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While nurses and doctors desperately tried to save the boy&#146;s life,
his older brother sat in an adjoining room, burying his head in his hands, dreading the
inevitable outcome. When he heard people shouting, &#147;It&#146;s no use; he&#146;s
dead,&#148; the brother collapsed and his whole body shook with sobs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Somewhere in America, while some Palestinian children die, other more
fortunate children&#150;not too much younger than the child who so tragically lost his
life in an emergency room a world away&#150;tangle over a soccer ball. Across the carpet
of green, yellow and dry brown leaves crumble onto the sea of grass. It is difficult for
me to comprehend why there has to be such a cruel contrast where Palestinian children have
to fight for their lives and for their freedom in an indifferent world against an armed
Israeli militia who does its best to kill, mutilate and silence them without conscience. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Back to me sitting somewhere in America, where the trees&#146; changing
leaves to golds and ambers silently watch over the melee of kids and parents. The sun
shines favourably down on the innocence of youth in a very non-innocent country. It is a
country where dogs fattened by a bounty of chemical commercial dog food are taken out for
walks. Dogs that lead better lives than many people do in underdeveloped
countries&#150;certainly in such a country as Palestine where children must die in the
name of freedom. Yet, it is a country, too, where homeless Americans search trash bins in
hopes of finding a morsel to eat or a tin can to sell for a penny or two. It is a country
where fake politicians bargain over who can castigate Palestinians the most and who can
demand that the U.S. no longer give them any more money as if the Palestinian citizens had
ever been fortunate enough to get any money in the first place. No politician ever dares
to mention that it is Israel that gets billions and billions of American dollars and the
latest weapons in order to preserve their Zionist State and in order to kill off more of
the indigenous inhabitants of the patches of what is left of Palestinian territory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a country where women like Hilary Clinton have sold their souls to
the devil while they denounce the Palestinian children dying in hospitals where medical
supplies are scarce. In sharp contrast, Palestine is a place filled with newly dug graves
watered by the tears of mothers who will not have the luxury of watching their children
grow up at all.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But America is a country where pampered and spoiled American children are
carted off to soccer games or basketball games or other sports and indulged in all the
ways a child could be indulged while children of lesser circumstances do not have that
luxury of being a participant in a leisurely game in a leisurely world where the greatest
concern of such children is what cartoon to watch or what video game to buy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I cannot understand why any child must die. Life is so precious, life
should be so beautiful. Why are Palestinian children abused, crippled and killed just
because they happen to be born Palestinian? Why should Jewish children whose parents had
their own homes in other countries take away what is rightfully Palestinian? Why do world
leaders condone the killing of Palestinian children but are outraged when one or two
Israeli soldiers are killed?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I see the contrast and it pains me deeply. I taste the tears of
Palestinian mothers crying for their dead or wounded children. I see American children
chase after the soccer ball and hear their screams of delight. I feel the last of the
Indian summer sunshine warm me but when people smile at me, I feel the shallowness of
their smiles chill my very being, for it is the same people who condone either by
ignorance or by wilful distortion of the truth what is happening a world away to children
who deserve to be as happy as children anywhere else on God&#146;s good earth.</p>
