<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are looming conspiracies targeting the enduring cause of over 4
million Palestinian refugees, scattered and dispersed to the four corners of the globe,
awaiting repatriation to the homeland from which they were expelled at gunpoint when the
Zionist entity came into being over 50 years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And it seems that many regional and international players are involved in
this sinister political game aimed at liquidating the symbol of the Pal-holocaust, or
Nakba.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the forefront of these players is, of course, the Zionist regime
itself, the ultimate tormentor of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That criminal and racist regime would simply like to see the refugees
banished to another galaxy. The logic here is simple: as long as the proprietor of the
stolen goods is out of sight, the thief needn&#146;t worry.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fortunately for Israel, the thief has many supporters and subordinates,
including the world&#146;s last remaining superpower&#150;the United States&#150;and a
number of governments here and there in the region. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The United States&#150;the obsequious monkey for the rapacious and
domineering organ-grinder which is the thief (Israel)&#150;is also interested in imposing
&#147;stability&#148; on the region in order to maintain its puppet regimes in the region
and consequently retain its hegemony over the Arab oil wealth.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Arafat? Well, the Palestinian Authority autocrat whose 6-year-old
nepotistic regime has been marked by interning his political critics rather than by
protecting the Palestinian people&#146;s interests is neither free nor able to take a real
stand on the refugee issue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat is simply the embodiment of the disgraceful Oslo agreement whose
undoing is his undoing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Arafat of late has been scaling-down his tune on the refugees,
content with demanding a &#147;just settlement&#148; for the refugees. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His concept of a &#147;just settlement&#148; seems to lie in allowing some
of the refugees, preferably those who have nowhere to go, to be resettled in the West
Bank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, for the refugees and the vast bulk of the Palestinian people,
this is just as rejected a conspiracy as the reported American feelers on settling
hundreds of thousands of refugees in the western Iraqi desert in exchange for lifting the
sanctions on Iraq.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The refugees are not eager or willing to be cheated by allowing Arafat and
Israel to circumvent their right of return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It must be a return to (THEIR) towns and villages from which they had been
expelled, and the talk here is specifically about Haifa, Yaffa and Safad, not Ramallah,
Nablus and Abu Dis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conspiracy on the refugee issue is also supplemented by the political
cheapness of certain Arab regimes that voice some willingness to join the boat of
treachery by accepting to settle additional hundreds of thousands of refugees on their
soil mainly in return for some generous American hand-outs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, there is no guarantee whatsoever that these diabolical
designs on the part of the &#147;American-Zionist-Arab coalition&#148; will succeed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian refugees themselves are not going to budge regarding this
liquidation of their enduring and just cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, there can be no peace in the region, or inside Zionist-occupied
Palestine, if the refugees are not allowed to return to their former homes. This is their
absolute and inalienable right as set down in United Nations resolution 194.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Otherwise, any international game played to force the refugees to abandon
their right of return would only result in incalculable instability and turbulence in this
region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every refugee would then become a suicide bomber, every Palestinian would
become a time-bomb, every Israeli tour bus will become a legitimate target for the
legitimate frustration and anger engulfing the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When and if the Palestinians are forced into the corner, even if some
green American dollars are thrown unto them, they would find themselves in a situation
where they have nothing to lose.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This would be very dangerous, and no despotic regime, whether it be Arafat
or anyone else, would be able to stem the tide of Palestinian anger.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the Palestinians won&#146;t be alone in their fury. Muslims and free
people around the world would join them in their renewed struggle for justice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This might be an inescapable eventuality.</p>
