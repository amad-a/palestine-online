<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Fatah thugs attack Gaza's Islamic University</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza town (Gaza Strip)- PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once again, Arafat's supporters acted in a very uncivilized manner toward
their fellow countrymen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 18 April, shortly before noon, scores of Palestinian college students
were injured during clashes between Islamist students and supporters of Palestinian
Authority leader Yasser Arafat on the campus of the Islamic University in Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to reliable sources at the University, the clashes began when
hundreds of pro-Arafat Shabiba students from the Azhar University began hurling stones on
the mostly Islamist students of the nearby Islamic University.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The stone-throwing was apparently sparked by an earlier argument at the
Islamic University between members of the Shabiba (Fatah) movement and Hamas supporters
who control the student council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Saleh Na'ami, a Gaza-based journalist, pro-Arafat students
pasted portraits of PA leader Yasser Arafat on a billboard on campus without permission
from the council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The portraits were removed by the student council officials, prompting the
Shabiba to summon their supporters from the nearby Azhar University.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Na'ami said over 40 students were injured, mostly sustaining light wounds.
At least three people were hospitalized.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA police arrived on the scene later, firing into the air and hurling tear
gas shells at the students.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the incident, the administrations of the Islamic and al-Azhar
universities decided to shut down the two colleges for 48 hours in order to defuse
tension.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clashes a result of underlying frustration</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mahmud al-Zahar, a prominent Islamist spokesman in Gaza and a lecturer at
the Islamic University, attributed the clashes to &quot;underlying frustration suffocating
the Palestinian society.&#148; He added, &#147;We have repeatedly warned the Palestinain
Authority that the situation is similar to a powder keg and that it could explode at any
time.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that ordinary Palestinians were made extremely indignant by the
failure of the peace process to achieve even the very minimal of Palestinian aspirations,
as well as the effect of the widespread corruption within the PA, the abuses of public
office that take place and the excess of the PA security agencies against the people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, also a lecturer at the Islamic University,
opined that the onslaught by the &#147;Arafatists&#148; against a Palestinian university
reflected a serious morbidity in the way Fatah followers are indoctrinated and raised.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;When you see hundreds of students attack a university with
stones...there is something wrong, to put it very mildly.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rantisi accused the Fatah leadership of &#147;portraying Hamas as a
vicarious enemy... so instead of fighting Israel&#150;the enemy&#150;there is another
enemy; it is Hamas,&#148; said Rantisi. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Rantisi&#146;s reasoning was vindicated by a leaflet, distributed
by the Shabiba on the same day the clashes took place. The leaflet contained a tirade of
name-calling against Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among other things, Hamas was described as &#147;a Jordanian tool, a
Syrian tool, a British tool and an Israeli tool.&#148; Hamas was also referred to as
&#147;a Mossad Entity...that sows divisiveness in the Palestinian society.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The extreme language, said a local observer, reflected mounting
frustration among Fatah supporters who have come to lose one stronghold after the other to
Hamas in recent years. Fatah still controls the student council at the Azhar University
and a number of other smaller institutions, largely through unfair tactics, falsified
elections and simply through admitting &#147;students&#148; who happen to be cadres of the
numerous security agencies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Fatah movement, nonetheless, has suffered major setbacks during the
last few years, mainly owing to the failure of the peace process and the widespread graft
and corruption permeating the PA regime. Fatah lost some of its major strongholds to
Hamas, like that of the University of Birzeit and the Najah National University in Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian universities and colleges are the only place where democratic
elections are allowed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat has so far refused to allow general or municipal elections to take
place, apparently lest he and his Fatah organization lose to the Islamist opposition. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA severance from the Palestinian people</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>The renowned Israeli journalist, Amira Hass, has
written extensively on the Palestinian cause. During the intifadah (1987-1993), she moved
to the Gaza Strip to watch closely the extent of Israeli torment and persecution of the
helpless people residing there. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the conclusion of the scandalous Oslo agreement, she moved to
Ramallah to examine closely the Mafia-like structure and operation of Yasser Arafat&#146;s
Authority. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ms. Hass also closely shares the lives of the little person in the
Palestinian street, while she admirably and vociferously upholds the universal values of
justice and equality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So incensed with the soft, or rather defeatist, attitude of Palestinian
negotiators in the so-called peace talks, Ms. Hass commented in one of her editorials a
few months ago that the Israeli negotiators do not take their Palestinian counterparts
seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli negotiators realize, she said, darn well that their
Palestinian counterparts are hostages to a recently acquired sense of personal security,
after long years of wandering, and the convenience of lavish perks that their privileged
status as members of an inner circle accords them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Somehow, all institutions are relegated to the cult of personality, and
the Edward Saids, Hanan Ashrawis, Iyad Sarajs and tens of thousands of accomplished
Palestinians are disenfranchised in favour of branded loyalists lacking in the necessary
acumen and international exposure that complex issues of negotiation warrant. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bolstering Israel&#146;s internal security&#150;a euphemism for cracking
down on popular protest against Israeli occupation and continued violation of human
rights&#150;is the measuring rod of the PA&#146;s conformity to the Oslo peace accords.
It&#146;s no wonder that Palestinian security chiefs are in centre stage with regard to
both influencing negotiations on the Palestinian side, as well as the ongoing
consolidation of power pending the war of succession after the eclipse of Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian security apparatus is ordained by the Mossad and the CIA,
and periodical certificates of good conduct are bestowed contingent upon the former&#146;s
conformity to the latter&#146;s shifty perception of security requirements. Constant close
coordination and monitoring takes place on an ongoing basis between the three security
parties, with the infamous CIA acting as the final arbiter. What an irony for yesteryear
freedom fighters! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Legislative Council&#150;the Palestinian
parliament&#150;is rendered a rubber stamp void of any effectiveness in keeping the
executive branch in line or from churning out a new breed of leaders responsive to the
prevailing mood of the masses through periodic public suffrages. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The European Commission and human rights organizations are not shy on
raising these issues in periodic reports that, sadly, go unheeded. Israel&#146;s
satisfaction with the level of cooperation regarding its perceived internal security
remains the overriding criterion upon which eligibility for receipt of a myriad of NGO and
donor-country funds is established. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a recent debate at McGill University with visiting Professor James
Graff of Toronto University&#150;a political scientist who has a real hands-on approach
when dealing with Palestinian affairs&#150;all he had to do to refute my devil-advocacy
thesis (that is there ought to be merits to the Oslo Accords in the PA somehow creating
the dynamics by virtue of its institution-creation capacity that would frustrate the
original Israeli designs) was simply point to a map hanging on the blackboard. The map
very graphically shows up-to-date splashes of disjointed PA-administered West Bank and
Gaza Strip territories&#150;termed zones A and B. He ridiculed Arafat&#146;s frequent
threats of declaring a Palestinian State. The very question raised is: declaring a
Palestinian State over what? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Professor Graff concluded our debate by stating that the Palestinian State
is what the PA structure is now: 80,000 paid civil servants, the bulk of whom are security
personnel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hass, in an article in <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i> on 12 April current, entitled,
&#147;Israel views repeated PA threats as empty&#148;, described the notion of a
Palestinian State as silly. She very much uses Professor Graff&#146;s terminology: &#147;A
Tiger&#146;s Spots&#148; State. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hass recounted three explanations why the Israelis do not take Palestinian
threats seriously, that is in comparison with threats emanating from other more serious
parties, such as the Syrians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first explanation is that the Israeli leadership understands perfectly
well the psyches of the leaders of the PA who enunciate the repeated threats. They do not
mean what they say. The threats are empty and are intended for the consumption of the
Palestinians in the street. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After Hass elaborates over the above explanation by concrete examples, she
then moves to recount the second explanation, that being the Israeli leadership&#146;s
deep conviction that the great majority of the Palestinians in the occupied territories
are strictly controlled by the PA, and as the PA is in the pocket (Hass&#146;s expression)
of Israel, so are the controlled Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Again, after some elaboration over the second point, she finishes her
article with the third explanation: &#147;As far as there is no blood-letting, the
attitude of indifference of the Israelis to Palestinian grievances would persist.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hass ends her article by stating that the Palestinians go on protesting
politely against the construction of new Jewish settlements, while the crusade of building
settlements goes unabated, and with it the ambition of a bigger land of Israel. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">U.S. seeks to blackmail Arafat into<br>
giving in to Zionist dictates</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- As widely expected, the latest trip by
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to Washington was no different from his
numerous previous trips. Arafat got all the trappings he is reputedly fond of and had an
audience with Bill Clinton at the White House&#150;the stately reception he is accorded in
exchange for blending the American strategy into the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clinton, who is about to become a lame-duck President, reiterated in
Arafat&#146;s presence the same tedious remarks about American commitment to the peace
process. But aside from that, the U.S. President refused to commit himself to pressuring
Israel to carry out the third stage of redeployment in the West Bank which&#150;according
to the hapless Oslo Accords&#150;should enable the PA to control up to 90 per cent of the
West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clinton even refused to spell out a clear American stance on the final
status talks and the ongoing barren talks aimed at formulating a framework agreement on
final status issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, Clinton reportedly sought to sell Ehud Barak&#146;s latest ideas
to Arafat concerning the framework agreement and Israel&#146;s willingness to be unusually
magnanimous toward the Palestinians if Arafat displayed a certain &#147;flexibility&#148;
on such cardinal issues as the future of Jerusalem, the refugees right of return and the
estimated 240 Jewish settlements dotting the West Bank from Jenin in the north to Dahiriya
in the south.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, Barak&#146;s ideas were nothing but a cheap attempt to bribe
Arafat whereby Israel would redeploy its occupation army from a further 10 or 11 per cent
of the West Bank (Greater Jerusalem is excluded) in exchange for Arafat&#146;s agreeing to
come to terms with Israeli positions on Jerusalem and the refugees, namely that Jerusalem
will remain Israel&#146;s &#147;eternal and undivided capital&#148; and &#147;the refugees
will be resettled in the Diaspora and receive compensation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the Israeli proposal in this regard, which is apparently backed
by the United States (the U.S. backs everything and anything suggested by Israel), was in
effect a re-formulation of the merge proposal which Barak forwarded when he was elected
Prime Minister nearly ten months ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the proposal was consistent with Barak&#146;s perception
of the final status solution in the West Bank according to which Israel would retain
control over Jerusalem, the settlements and the vital water sources, leaving up to 65 per
cent of the West Bank to Arafat and his prospective Palestinian entity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This perception has remained unchanged on the Israeli Prime
Minister&#146;s part. Indeed, Barak told a group of Gush Emmunim leaders (settler chiefs),
whom he met on 16 April, that the bulk of Jewish settlements in the West Bank would remain
under Israeli sovereignty and that he would seek to have the settlements in clusters,
apparently to make them more defendable. He also stressed that Israel would never return
to the 1967 borders and Jerusalem would remain the &#147;eternal capital of Israel.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This shows that all the talks and meetings in Washington as well as the
upcoming round of talks in Um Alrashrash (Elat) are actually more aimed at cajoling Arafat
to give in and less at getting Israel to retreat from its intransigent position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the PA leadership is not audacious enough, at least at this
stage, to publicly accept the Zionist dictates. Therefore, Arafat and his team will
continue to insist that any agreement with Israel will have to be based on United Nations
resolutions 242 and 338 as well as the formula of land-for-peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, several Palestinian officials dismissed Barak&#146;s statements as
&#147;test balloons&#148; which will continue to be unacceptable by the Palestinian
people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the United States and Israel also realize that the Palestinian
people will not accept such an arrangement even if Arafat is forced to cave in.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the two allies are busy seeking to devise a miracle
formula&#150;containing stick-and-carrot elements&#150;to be presented to or, if
necessary, imposed on Arafat, perhaps with active help from some regional parties, such as
the King of Jordan and/or the President of Egypt, who are both considered handy tools of
U.S. policy in the Middle East. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this is what seems to be in the offing for the time being, and the
U.S. administration is likely to start informing Arafat that time is running out in light
of the looming American elections and that he should take &#147;daring steps&#148; for
peace beforehand (which would be consistent with the peace of the brave!!!!).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in return, the American administration and its ultimate policy
reference&#150;the Zionist lobby&#150;might promise the PA autocrat to lend formal
recognition to a mini-Palestinian State on 60%-70% of the West Bank plus some 80% of the
Gaza Strip&#133;a sort of a bantustan surrounded by ubiquitous Israeli occupation and
bereft of any sovereignty or dignity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear at this stage how Arafat will respond to this very likely
American-Israeli approach, which is actually aimed at liquidating the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many observers here in Palestine surmise that Arafat may not give a clear
answer to any American proposals in this direction. This could mean that he would not give
&#147;yes&#148; or &#147;no&#148; for an answer. Or he might give &#147;yes&#148; and
&#147;no&#148; at the same time&#150;yes, to maintain his vital ties with the Americans
and no, for local Palestinian consumption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this scenario is unlikely to last for a long time and Arafat
can&#146;t ignore the Palestinian public opinion indefinitely. Indeed, Arafat could
eventually end up facing a dilemma, for he won&#146;t be able to publicly pronounce the
death of the peace process, because that process is the <i>raison d&#146;�tre</i> of his
regime&#146;s existence. At the same time, he won&#146;t dare to unilaterally declare
Palestinian Statehood without a modicum of coordination with Israel, which controls
everything on the ground.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A possible exit from this expected predicament is that the U.S., Israel
and Arafat will try to work out a formula that allows him to declare a small State on up
to 60% of the West Bank while the talks with Israel on the &#147;remaining outstanding
issues&#148; continue indefinitely. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the &#147;remaining outstanding issues&#148; include the
fundamental issues of the Arab-Israeli conflict, namely that of the status of Jerusalem,
the refugees, the water, the settlements and the land. In reality, this would be like
returning to square one, once again.</p>

in general in backing the Palestinian cause and people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Yassin hailed the delegates&#146; visit, which he said carried
great meanings, and praised the Muslims in South Africa for sticking to Islam. He called
on them to maintain contacts with Muslims all over the world to serve the Islamic issues
on the top of which are Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and Palestine. The Hamas leader asked them to
convey his greetings to the Muslim community in South Africa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For his part, spokesman on behalf of the delegation Sheikh Yousef Seidat,
member of the national committee for South African Muslims affirmed that Muslims in South
Africa support the Palestinian people&#146;s legitimate rights to their lands and Quds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirmed to a
Norwegian academic delegation that &#147;Hamas does not bear hatred against other
religions but rather resists the occupiers who expelled and displaced our Palestinian
people from their lands,&#148; and underlined that the Palestinian people were the victims
of the Israeli occupation of Palestine in 1948, which was followed by the occupation of
the rest of Palestine in 1967.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas charged that the Zionist regime posed the real threat to peace in
the whole region and underscored that its nuclear armament, continued military build up
and its arrogant policies proved it was not serious in achieving peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statements were voiced during a meeting between a delegation of
Norwegian university students with members of the Hamas leadership in Gaza, Dr. Abdul Aziz
Ranteesi and Ismail Abu Shanab, at Hamas office in Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They explained to the students that the resistance was meant as
self-defence against occupation and to realize Palestinian national goals in restoring
usurped rights and to live in peace and security.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Movement officials added that self-defence was not terrorism, adding
that terrorism is found in Israel&#146;s practices against the Palestinian and the
Lebanese peoples and cited massacres in the Ibrahimi Mosque, Aqsa Mosque and Qana as best
proof.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas leaders pointed out that Israel was the real threat to peace in the
region and that it was not serious in its peace overtures since it was still continuing in
nuclear and military mobilization to threaten the whole region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The delegation listened to detailed explanation by the Hamas leaders on
goals and establishment of the Movement, the Palestinian situation and Israeli practices
against the Palestinian people including settlement expansion, detainees, economic
conditions and the refugees&#146; status in the Diaspora in addition to the inalienable
Palestinian rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas leaders invited the delegates to visit the Palestinian refugee camps
in Gaza Strip to get a first hand information on the hardships that face the Palestinian
people and to know for themselves the truth that the Zionist media always twist.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the concept that Palestine was an Islamic Waqf, the Hamas leaders said
that Waqf means that Palestine was not the property of any<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>person but rather the property of all
Muslims and all generations. Consequently, they elaborated, any treaty or agreement with
any other party surrendering an inch of Palestine was considered null and void<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked on human rights in Islam, the Hamas leaders affirmed that Islam
endorsed human rights 14 centuries ago while the West only knew them in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, and underlined that Islam embodies human rights in a more expanded and suitable
method to humans than those preached by earthly beings.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Shin Bet, the Zionist regime's main domestic
intelligence agency, has recommended to the Israeli government that all prisoners
supporting PA Chairman Yaser Arafat be freed as part of negotiations with the Palestinian
leadership on the final status issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli Hebrew daily, Ha'aretz, reported that the recommendation
includes prisoners convicted of killing or wounding Israelis<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The position of the Shin Bet reportedly draws no distinction between the
prisoners on the basis of their actions, but only on the basis of their organizational
affiliation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Shin Beth, however, takes a stringent approach to Islamist prisoners,
believing they should be kept incarcerated indefinitely due to their organizations' firm
opposition to the sell-out of Palestinian rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Ha'aretz, part of the rationale for releasing Arafat's
supporters is that both sides fought a protracted war and that, effectively, there is no
substantive difference between killing by bombing them from the air and killing civilians
with fire bombs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Israeli internal security minister Shlomo Ben Ami opposed the
unconditional release of the pro-Arafat prisoners<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an interview with the Israeli state-run radio, Ben Ami said Israel
should link the release of the prisoner with &quot;progress in talks with the
Palestinians.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli minister was apparently alluding to using the prisoners as
bargaining chips for extracting further Palestinian concessions on the final status
issues, such as Jerusalem and the refugees. </p>

on return AND compensation</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b>The leaders of Palestinian refugees in Jordan have
again stressed the refugees absolute and inalienable right to return to their homes and
villages from which they were expelled at gun point when the Zionist entity was created
more than fifty years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, refugees representatives as well political groups identified
with the refugees' cause signed a petition rejecting &quot;all forms of settling
Palestinian refugees and ensure their return to Palestine.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition was signed by members of professional associations and
political parties, and opposition leaders have signed the petition<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among those who signed the petition are Laith Shbeilat, Bahjat abu
Gharbiyeh, members of the Jordan medical, dental and writers association.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jordanian English paper, the Jordan Times, quoted one of the
organizers of the petition, Abdullah Hammouda as saying, &quot;there is no room for a
compromise between the right of return and compensation. Our goal is to return, nothing
else.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hammouda, who<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>writes
opinion columns for independent Jordanian papers, said Palestinian refugees &quot;will
reject compensation as a replacement of this right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest revival of the refugees' demands for repatriation and
restitution comes at a time when Israel and the PA are discussing the final status issues
of which the refugees' cause is considered the central issue along that of Jerusalem. </p>

prison sentences on attackers </font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Palestinian Authority &quot; State Security
Court&quot; on 23 April sentenced five Fatah activists to imprisonment for different
periods on charge of assaulting the PA minister of Environment Yosef Abu Safiyye in his
office Ramallah last month.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA state-run radio said the court sentenced the deputy-minister of
environment Ibrahim Abu Gharbiyeh to five and half month in jail on charges of assaulting
a public servant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Four other aides of Abu Gharbiyeh were sentenced to four years in Jail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They are Musa Abdullah Othman Abu Gharbiyeh, Basem Abu Gharbiyeh, Hamdi
Abu Gharbiye and Feras al Muzayyen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sentences were criticized by Fatah and the Abu Gharbiyeh clan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli state-run radio said East Jerusalem businesses shut down in
protest at the sentences and youngsters at the Qalandya refugee camp south of Ramallah
hurled stones on joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier last month, the five defendants beat Abu Safiyeh in his office,
prompting angry reactions from the Palestinian public opinion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some observers believe PA Chairman Yaser Arafat will commute the sentence
or even pardon the perpetrators in order not to alienate them and their relatives. </p>

expect more corruption in PA bodies</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">West Bank &#150;</b> A senior Palestinian official has disclosed that the
Palestinian intelligence had recently supervised an opinion poll in the West Bank and Gaza
strip at the orders of PA chief Yasser Arafat to probe the real stands of the Palestinian
street regarding the peace process in the light of the stalemate in the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and failure of the Geneva summit between the U.S.
president Bill Clinton and the Syrian president Hafez Assad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poll carried surprises for the Palestinian leadership, for it
displayed a decrease in percentage of those who oppose armed resistance against the
Zionists while a very low percentage (9%) trusted Barak&#146;s seriousness in forging a
real peace with the Palestinians and Arabs as only 22% believed that a final peace
settlement will be concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Barak government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poll further revealed that 42% support declaring an independent
Palestinian state before end of this year while 65% believe that corruption existed in PA
bodies and 72% believe that corruption will increase in future and 75% affirm that jobs
are distributed according to mediation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poll, which the Palestinian official described as very accurate,
showed that those supporting Yasser Arafat had dwindled to 33% while three months ago the
studies and research centre in Nablus had said that those who supported Arafat were around
57%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally most Palestinians approached fear to criticize the PA and its
officials, 77%, which clearly indicates results of the role played by Palestinian security
apparatuses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

in Palestinian opposition factions</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza (Palestine) &#150; QP:</b> A prominent leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement, Hamas, has denied Israeli reports that Iran had formed a union of
Palestinian and Lebanese factions that oppose a peaceful settlement with Israel with the
aim of launching armed attacks against the Zionist state.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dr. Abdul Aziz Ranteesi, Hamas spokesman in Gaza, welcomed cooperation
with Iran and receiving support from it, in its capacity as an Islamic country and not a
hostile state such as the U.S. and Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An Israeli official had accused Iran of forming some kind of a union
grouping Hizbollah with Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the popular front for the liberation of
Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril to launch military operations against
Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Ranteesi confirmed his Movement&#146;s pledge to work with all
available potentials for the sake of releasing all Palestinian and Arab detainees in the
Israeli prisons. He was commenting on news of an Israeli intelligence (Shabak)
recommendation to the Israeli premier Ehud Barak to release all Palestinian prisoners with
the exception of those of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>We, in Hamas, are pleased with the release of any
Palestinian, we do not differentiate between a detainee belonging to the PLO, Hamas or
Islamic Jihad. They are all Palestinians,&#148; Dr. Ranteesi underlined.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that Hamas has vowed to work with all possible means to set them
free, noting that it was &#147;A religious, moral and patriotic duty that will remain
until the last Palestinian prisoner is released from Israeli jails.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza &#150; </b>&#147;Godfather&#148; is the Palestinian Authority
chairman Yasser Arafat&#146;s new title after he was usually called the
&#147;Khityar&#148; or the old man ever since he was a young man. The new title indicates
that he was running his self-rule Authority similar to the Mafia godfathers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the fact that corruption is a common element in all third world
countries, yet the situation is more tragic in the Palestinian autonomous enclaves. Many
have started to compare between the rule of the Zionist occupation and that of Arafat,
saying that the first was much better. Pamphlets were being circulated calling for an
Intifada against Arafat but secret police used to confiscate them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah officials control almost everything while telephone threats warn
anyone who dares to express his objection openly regardless of its content. Three Fatah
cadres were forced to resign in mid April to face charges, to one of them, of drug
trafficking.</p>

West Bank, Gaza, on Israel&#146;s behalf </font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The Palestinian autonomous authority has
introduced a new set of rules and regulations aimed at throttling charity committees in
the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources, the new regulations include slashing 10%
off of all money received by the charity committees as well as requiring a PA
official&#146;s endorsement for any one-time assistance exceeding 1,000 Jordanian dinars
(US$ 1,420).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are Zakat committees virtually in every town and village in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip which receive charity money from the rich.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Israel, the CIA and the PA suspect that the committees might have
connections with the Islamist organizations in Palestine since most of those responsible
for these committees happen to be religious Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two years ago, Israel instructed Arafat to &#147;narrow the horizons&#148;
of the Zakat committees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat himself had asked the donor countries to give him hundreds of
millions of dollars to create an alternative social programme that would help the poor and
the needy and make them stop going to the committees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat got all of the money he asked for, but reportedly used it to build
luxurious villas and buy smart, new cars for his men. Hamas accuses Zionist entity of
utilizing Palestinian detainees as a</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">card for political bargaining</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has charged that the Israeli
occupation was still considering Palestinian detainees as a political bargaining chip and
an effective negotiating tool which it exploits to conclude unacceptable solutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Movement issued a statement on the occasion of Palestinian
Prisoner&#146;s day indicating that catering for the detainees and their families in a
dignified manner and in a way suitable for heroes is the least that one could do. The
Movement called for popular support in this field, especially in social solidarity with
families of those detainees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement noted that the official efforts in this regard would not be
enough since they are limited to financial assistance, which itself is very limited.
Hence, the Palestinian factions, forces and institutions should live up to the importance
of that mission.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hamas Movement underscored that the file of Palestinian detainees in
Israeli occupation jails could not be separated from that of the political detainees in
prisons of the Palestinian Authority, which should be closed once and for all.</p>
