had sanctions</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ramsey Clark, Former Attorney General of the United
States</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are Iraqi children crying. There are Iraqi children
dying. By our silence, we, spectators in the arena of punishment share the
guilt of their tragedy. The build up of tensions between Iraq and the American
administration will undoubtedly end in further disaster for the Iraqi people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Seven years of sanctions have devastated Iraq. The sanctions
are merely a tool employed by the Security Council to wage genocide against
the Iraqis. How ironic that the United Nations, supposedly an organization
for promoting peace around the world has in reality become an implement
of destruction and war. The UN has evolved to be without a heart and the
Wizard who pulls the strings, nothing less than an instrument of evil.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It does not take a political scientist to figure out that
further destruction of Iraq is just what the Israelis want. And it is not
surprising either that Israel, the monster that the US created, manipulates
American foreign policy in the Middle East. What is slightly perplexing
however is the fact that there are so many Zionist Jews serving in the Clinton
administration. Zionist Jews who would like to see Iraq further weakened
for the benefit of Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is strange how Israel is loaded with nuclear and biological
weapons yet is never asked to account for itself.  There have been various
scandals concerning the Israeli spying of American military capabilities
but all incidents have been covered up and shelved or ignored.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Iraq has been so weakened by death, sickness, malnutrition
and the lack of any stable  civilian infrastructure that it is in fact incapable
of waging  a war against any country and would not be able to effectively
withstand another onslaught of attacks from the coalition forces.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the years of sanctions have failed to dislodge
Saddam's regime. They have only succeeded in punishing the people who are
guilty of no crime in the first place.  Since the Gulf War, more than one
million people have died because of sanctions, many of who are children.
 The deaths have been due to disease, malnutrition and lack of medicine.
Water treatment plants presently operate at only 50 percent capacity and
most sewage processing plants are not implementing chemical treatment. The
two great and historic rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, have become
reservoirs for untreated sewage and industrial waste, thus exposing the
people to further water and air borne illnesses. Too, there is serious lack
of basic medical supplies such as syringes, oxygen, anesthesia, and other
medical equipment has broken down such as incubators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Instead of protecting  human rights, indeed, the sanctity
of life, the UN Security Council continues to contribute to the collective
punishment of the civilian population and ultimately to the countless deaths
incurred by the prolongation of the sanctions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is clear that American intentions in Iraq are Zionist
with the sole aim of completely destroying a nation that was once one of
the most advanced in the Middle East. The disposal of U.S. aircraft carriers
like the George Washington, a guided missile cruiser and an attack submarine,
to the Gulf is an ominous sign.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For the Iraqi people who have already suffered more than
is bearable, these carriers are weapons to wage death against the helpless
civilian population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The genocide of the innocent ensues and we, the world,
are their executioners. Though it seems that the Russians have diffused
the present crisis, only a major confrontation for the time being has been
avoided. But the sanctions will continue because the New World Order which
is total disorder, is masterminded by America with Zionism at its font.
An evil concept and dangerous principle that is without a conscious and
without a soul.<BR>
