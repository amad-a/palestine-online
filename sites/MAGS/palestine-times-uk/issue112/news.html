<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khaled Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite a hastily reached cease-fire between the Zionist regime and the
Palestinian Authority, bloody confrontations and sporadic gun battles continued to rage
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip as of 4 October. So far, the Palestinian martyr
toll exceeds 70, and the number of injuries has reached more than 2,000, with scores of
those sustaining serious gunshot wounds, including brain haemorrhage. The Zionists said
five of their soldiers and a settler were killed as of 4 October.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 2 October, the Israeli occupation forces used helicopter gun-ships,
anti-tank rockets and heavy machine-guns against Palestinian protesters in Gaza. Army
helicopters attacked with rockets several buildings in Gaza, near the Netzarim junction,
inflicting heavy casualties among Palestinian police and civilians. The aerial bombardment
prompted local authorities in Khan Younis to evacuate more than 300 families. Eyewitnesses
said the bombardment deliberately targeted residential areas and housing buildings. At
least 40 apartments were destroyed by the bombing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Helicopters were also used earlier in Nablus against Palestinian
protesters in the city centre, killing and injuring scores of people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, gun battles raged in Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho, as well
as in several locations in Gaza and continued until after midnight on Monday (2 October),
causing numerous injuries, especially among the decidedly inferior Palestinian troops who
only carry out-dated AK-47 rifles with a range not exceeding 100 metres. Moreover, most
Palestinian policemen who are posted along the so-called friction lines between
PA-administered enclaves and Israeli-Occupied areas were either disarmed at instructions
from Yasser Arafat or were simply ordered not to open fire, even in self-defence. However,
it seems that many policemen and soldiers opted to disregard orders, hence the limited
number of Israeli casualties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1948-Palestine, the intifadah (or uprising) started on Saturday, 30
September, one day after the Aqsa massacre, with mass demonstrations protesting the
Zionist carnage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday 1 October, violent clashes, unprecedented since 1948, spread
throughout Arab towns and villages from Kufr Kanna in the north to Rahat in the south.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most violent confrontations took place in Um al-Fahem, Kufr Kanna,
Arraba, the Nazereth and even in some so-called mixed towns such as Akka and Haifa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At Um al-Fahem, the Zionist police reportedly tried to assassinate the
town&#146;s mayor and leader of the Islamic movement in Israel, Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A police sniper fired a rubber-coated steel bullet straight at
Salah&#146;s face, causing him to lose consciousness for a while. Salah regained
consciousness later and he reportedly recuperated completely.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, at least five protesters at Um al-Fahem were martyred and as many
as 100 people were injured, five of them seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two martyrs were also reported in Sakhnin and another two in Arraba, in
addition to one in the Nazareth and a sixth in the village of Jith in the Triangle Area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All in all, the number of martyrs of the Aqsa intifada among the
1,300,000-strong Palestinian community in the Jewish State (1948-Palestine) reached 14,
while the injuries topped the 200-figure.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Killing a child in his father&#146;s arms</b></u><br>
The Israeli army apparently received orders from the highest political level to repress
Palestinian protests with maximum force and at any price. The carnage was epitomized in
the cold-blooded murder on 1 October of Rami al-Durra, a 12-year-old Palestinian child
who, along with his father, sought cover from Israeli soldiers&#146; bullets against a
concrete wall in Gaza. An Israeli sniper shot dead the terrified child in full view of the
world (the phantasmagoric image of the incident was shown on TV screens around the world).
Minutes after killing Rami, Israeli soldiers positioned only a few metres from the father
and his dying son shot and seriously wounded the father, 42-year-old Jamal al-Durra.
Shortly thereafter, when a Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulance driver, namely
Bassam al-Balbisi, 45, approached the father and son in order to move them into an
ambulance, he was shot and killed on the spot, apparently by the same solider who shot and
killed Rami. Jamal, the father of five remaining children is in serious but stable
conditions, having sustained at least five bullets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, according to PA Minister of Health Riadh al-Zanoun, over 30% of
Palestinian casualties were children under the age of 17, and most of the wounds they
sustained were in the upper parts of their bodies. This clearly suggests that Israeli
soldiers were shooting to kill. The youngest Palestinian child to be murdered by Israeli
troops was Sara Abdul Azeem Abdul Haq of Salfit. The 18-month-old Sara was returning from
hospital near Salfit in the central part of the West Bank when the car she was driving
came under a hail of bullets, apparently from Israeli soldiers or settlers. She died
instantly, and her cousin, a five-year-old, sustained moderate injuries.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Massacre at Aqsa Mosque</b></u><br>
Palestinian protests, which initially were largely peaceful, started on Thursday, 28
September, after convicted Israeli war criminal Ariel Sharon, who oversaw the grisly
massacres of some 2,700 Palestinian men, women and children at the Sabra and Shatilla
refugee camps near Beirut in 1982, visited the Haram al-Sharif complex in Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon made the visit in defiance of Muslim sensibilities and in utter
disregard of warnings that the visit could spark unpredictable violence and bloodshed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Friday, the Zionist regime deployed over 4,000 policemen to and around
the Haram al-Sharif, and as soon as Muslims finished their congregational prayer, the
Zionists began firing randomly at the worshipers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One elderly man, who was hit in the nose, said, &#147;As soon as I said
finished my prayer, saying Assalamu alaikum warahmatullah&#133;I was hit with a
bullet.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least eight worshipers were martyred by Zionist bullets and scores of
people were injured, some seriously.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Cease-fire</b></u><br>
On 3 October, it was reported that the Zionist regime and the Palestinian Authority
reached an agreement in the early hours of Tuesday morning to call for a cease-fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Under the accord, the Palestinian side will take responsibility for
dealing with any security cases that might arise after the Israeli withdrawal from the
entrances of Palestinian towns.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the cease-fire agreement will put an end
to the evolving uprising, giving the high casualties among Palestinians and the virulent
atmosphere between the Zionists and the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, it is important to remember that the showdown at the Aqsa
Mosque, the epicentre of the Palestinian-Zionist conflict, will continue to trigger fresh
unrest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, it is difficult to predict if and how the intifadah at al-Aqsa
will end. The issue, after all, has to do with religion and faith.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Martin Indyk suspected of passing <br>
classified information to Israel</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">United States Ambassador to the Zionist regime, Martin Indyk, now under
investigation for security violations, may have passed &#147;classified information&#148;
to unidentified Israeli officials, according to American and Israeli press reports from
the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If true, Indyk&#146;s actions would constitute a serious breach of trust
bordering on espionage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">American officials would not at this point say everything about what Indyk
might have done in violation of standing instructions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There is no indication of espionage in this matter. At this time,
there is no indication that any intelligence information has been compromised.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clearly, the key word in the above phrase is &#147;at this time&#148;,
which implies that he could be found guilty of some sort of espionage later. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 25 September, a senior U.S. official told CNN that Indyk was being (in
part) investigated for bringing home classified documents to read.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indyk, whose security clearance was suspended on 12 September, had been
warned numerous times by his supervisors about mishandling secure documents.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the &#147;mishandling&#148; of secure documents may only be the
outer fa�ade of the Indyk affair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last May, Indyk was reportedly directly linked to the Israeli decision to
bomb the Beka&#146;a Valley.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli press reports then said that Indyk had played a part in the said
Israeli decision, but gave no details as to the nature of his involvement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He, according to some analysts, may have passed classified documents to
the Israelis, which played an important part in the Israeli decision to bomb electricity
power stations and Hizbullah targets in Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, it is also believed that Indyk had passed classified information
to top figures in the Israeli right-wing opposition party, the Likud, pertaining to the
talks between Israel and the Palestinians and the extent of concessions the Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak is willing to give the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, on many occasions, Likud leader Ariel Sharon embarrassed Barak by
disclosing details of the extent of proposed Israeli concessions to the Palestinian
Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These details are believed to have been passed by the Americans to Sharon,
possibly through Indyk. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, Indyk may have passed sensitive information pertaining
to Arab States to Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government, meanwhile, has sought to distance itself from an
association with the Indyk affair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials shunned comments on the affair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called the investigation
of Indyk &#147;an internal American matter that has nothing to do with Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the investigation does seem to have something to do with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indyk is known to be a close confidant of Barak, and it is highly believed
that whatever mishandling of classified information on his part took place in Israel, not
in the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indyk, a former Jewish lobbyist and high-ranking official at
AIPAC&#150;the main pro-Israeli lobby in the United States&#150;is believed to be
harbouring views critical of the peace process and perceived Israeli concessions to the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On many occasions, PA officials, including chief negotiator Sa&#146;eb
Ureikat, described Indyk (along with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross) as &#147;having views that
are more extremist than those presented by Israel officials.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Australian-born Indyk was named the senior Middle East specialist on
the National Security Council in January 1993.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his first ambassadorship he was an important conduit between the
Clinton administration and the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indyk is one of several top American Jewish officials occupying sensitive
posts in the Clinton administration. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The list includes such figures as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, National Security Advisor Sandy Burger, U.S. envoy to
the Middle East Dennis Ross and his aide Aaron Miller.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem- </strong>An Israeli army spokesman admitted
that Israeli soldiers murdered the Palestinian child Mohammad Al-Dura on 1 October.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The spokesman claimed the soldiers were responding to stone throwing and
didn&#146;t notice the child and his father who were taking cover against a wall from
Israeli bullets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Zionist spokesman didn&#146;t say why the soldiers, after
killing the terrified child, subsequently fired on his equally terrified father, and then
killed the ambulance driver, Bassam Balbisi, who sought to take them to hospital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The haunting and graphic image of the cold-blooded murder was shown in
slow sequence on TV screens around the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The phantasmagoric images clearly show that the murder was intentional,
premeditated, and extremely nefarious. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- </b>Israeli police on 1 October attempted to murder
Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah, the leader of the Islamic Movement in the 1948 Occupied
Palestine, and the mayor of the Arab town of Um-Alfahem, Palestinian sources said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sources said Israeli police seeking to quell Arab protests over
Zionist atrocities against Palestinians in the West Bank deliberately fire a rubber-coated
steel bullet at Salah&#146;s face.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hospital sources said Salah was not in a life-threatening situation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, tens of thousands of Palestinians in the Jewish state took to the
streets on 1 October to show solidarity with their Palestinian brothers in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In several instances, the Israeli police used live ammunitions against
Arab protesters inside the Jewish state. More than 10 of Palestinians in the 1948 Occupied
Palestine have been killed and scores were injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arab Knesset member described Israel&#146;s draconian measures against
Palestinians as &#147;a full-fledged massacre.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They are communicating a message to us&#133; that either we succumb

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron- </b>Trigger-happy Israeli soldiers and settlers have apparently
targeted journalists and cameramen covering the continuing unrest in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 1 October, Israeli soldiers shot and seriously wounded two local
cameramen working for two foreign news agencies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amer al Ja&#146;abari, 30, a cameraman working for the American TV
network, A BC, was shot in the forehead, apparently with a steel bullet.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His condition was described as &#145;serious,&#148; and hospital sources
said he was undergoing a surgical operation to save his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another cameramen, Mazen Da&#146;ana, 37, was also injured in the chest by
live ammunition. His condition was listed as &#147;serious.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist authorities repeatedly accused Palestinian cameramen and
journalists of &#147;inciting the world against us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian journalists and cameramen, especially those covering Israeli
repression of the Palestinian populace, work in extremely hazardous conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tulkarem -</b> Arab sources in the 1948-occupied Palestinian city of Lud
warned that Israelis were plotting a new scheme to liquidate Arab presence in the city.
They told the Quds Press that more than 100 Palestinian youths were shot and killed by
anonymous persons in the neighbouring cities of Lud and Ramleh over the past two months.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Former Arab member of the Lud municipality Yousef Shara&#146;ia called for
forming popular committees in the city, inhabited by Arabs and Jews, to foil such schemes
and to protect Arab youths.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He charged that it was not reasonable that more than 100 youths were
killed while the &#147;Israeli police were unable to determine the culprits&#148;,
doubting that homicidal reasons could be the motive for such murders.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tel Aviv - </b>Palestinian president Yasser Arafat had to enter the
house of Israeli premier Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv from the back door in order to evade
scores of Jewish settlers who were demonstrating outside Barak&#146;s house asking him not
to give up more land in the West Bank to the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arafat-Barak meeting&#150;the first since the Camp David
summit&#150;supposedly also ended in a failure to achieve any progress in the peace
process. Both refrained from giving statements; however, information that leaked from the
meeting indicated that progress was made regarding essential issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A well-informed Palestinian source said that the Arafat-Barak meeting
followed an American demand, charging, meanwhile, that Barak was not ready to reach a
serious agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Head of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Qrei and Nabil Abu
Rudaina, an advisor to Arafat, attended the meeting along with Barak&#146;s security
advisor Dani Yatom and his acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Amy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abu Rudaina said that the meeting was nothing more than a working
session during which an evaluation of the status of the negotiations was made. He pointed
out that U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone for nearly two hours to both

success of the peace negotiations before the end of his term in office, slated for January
2001.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza - </b>Relatives of Palestinian detainees in Zionist jails staged a
sit-in before the headquarters of the Red Cross in Gaza City. They called on the
Palestinian negotiators to secure the release of all detainees in Zionist prisons before
signing any new peace agreements. They also called on the Zionist prison administration to
implement the agreements concerning the detainees, denouncing that administration&#146;s
repressive measures used against the prisoners topped by the policy of solitary
confinement. They affirmed that the detainees were planning to escalate their hunger
strikes from two to four days per week.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A mother of four detainees in Zionist jails expressed deep dismay at the
measures used to prevent visitors to those jails. She affirmed, however, that regardless
of the lapse of time, Palestine would one day return to its rightful owners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza - </b>Palestinian security sources revealed that the preventive
security apparatus headed by Jibril Rejoub recently received a shipment of plastic
handcuffs as a gift from the U.S. government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They added that the new shackles tie both thumbs of the detainee tightly
together behind his back thereby increasing his pain.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first to experience the new &#147;gift&#148; was Mohammed Sabha,
former head of the Najah University&#146;s Student Council, who was arrested in the wake
of the Aseera events. Sabha was released only two months ago after spending two years in
detention in the preventive security jails.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Preventive security started using the new jail in Beytonia near Ramallah,
which is called the &#147;Hamas&#148; prison by the security elements themselves, clear
proof that most of its internees are from the Hamas Movement.&nbsp;</p>
