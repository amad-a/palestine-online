<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">The merchant of Venice in Gaza</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The gruesome image of the sadistic murder by a Zionist thug of the
Palestinian child Mohammad Durra in Gaza on 1 October, which was amply highlighted on TV
screens around the world, will be indelible for a long time to come.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the haunting spectre of the murder, which actually epitomizes the
Zionists&#146; long-standing treatment of Palestinians, Lebanese and other Muslims,
testifies to and characterizes the brutal ugliness of the Zionist mentality and its
callous disregard for the sanctity of human life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The murder scene defies linguistic description, and its nefariousness
transcends reality. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For who amongst humans would deliberately and callously kill a terrified
child seeking protection and safety in the arms of his equally terrified father, both of
whom are seeking cover from Zionist bullets against a concrete wall. The answer is: a
Zionist thug-soldier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Who would then riddle the freshly-bereaved and distraught father, crying
desperately &#147;my son is dying, my son is dying..please help me, please help me!&#148;,
with a volley of bullets, sending him atop the poor child&#146;s body&#133;whose innocent
soul already ascended to the highest&#133;to complain to God of Man&#146;s oppression
against his fellow Man. The answer is: the same Zionist thug.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, then, who would lay in wait for an ambulance driver, venturing with
admirable gallantry, to save the dying Mohammad and his bleeding father, and shoot him
straight in the head, killing him on the spot. The answer is again: the very same Zionist
thug.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, the poor child is killed, the bereaved father is seriously wounded,
and the poor driver falls martyr at the thug&#146;s indifferent bullets&#133;.and mission
&#147;young blood&#148; is over.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The phantasmagoric scene appeared on TV screens around the
world&#133;perhaps except in the United States&#133;where pain must remain a
Jewish-Zionist monopoly&#133;inaccessible to and withheld from others&#133;especially if
they happened to be Muslims or others falling under the American-classified category of
&#147;children of a lesser god.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If that concrete wall behind which poor Mohammad and his father sought
cover from the Zionists bullets of death could speak, it would probably weep and shed a
lot of tears before uttering a single word.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How could that vile beast view himself in the mirror again? But beasts, we
are told, have no guilty conscience. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But why call a vile thug a sadist, a human devil? Why call him a beast in
the first place? Beasts, after all, kill for survival whereas the Zionist barbarians, the
reincarnation of the Nazis, kill for joy&#133;only for joy&#133;.they become even worse
than the Nazis, their former oppressors. Remember what Harry Truman said about them once?
He said, &#147;Zionists are like all underdogs; when they get on the top, they become as
merciless and savage to their new victims as their former oppressors were to them when
they were underneath.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His words have been vindicated&#133;since a long time ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, it is imperative to point out that we are not dealing
here with an isolated or anecdotal incident involving an undisciplined soldier acting in
contravention of outstanding orders, nor are we talking about a person suffering from any
form of mental or psychological problems. In fact, the murderer of Mohammad Durra is
considered an &#147;exemplary soldier&#148; in the Israeli army, and it is not unexpected
at all that he will be promoted and receive a certain award for his &#147;superb
performance.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, the merits of a Zionist soldier are measured in proportion to the
amount of innocent men, women and children he murdered. Even the current Zionist Prime
Minister had to remind Zionist voters of the murderous episodes in which he had been
involved in order to get elected&#133;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, how should Muslims deal with a Satanic entity as such, with a
diabolical mentality as such, with a virulent ideology as such. Israel by all means is a
malignancy whose components include atheism, racism, fascism, jingoism, militarism and
expansionism. In other words, it has the same components that once comprised its sister
ideology, Nazism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fortunately, the world eventually triumphed over Nazism, but only after a
world war that nearly devastated the globe.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, should the world allow the malignant entity, known as Israel, to
grow? We should remember that there can be no compromises with malignancy&#133;.either you
eradicate it, or it will most certainly eradicate you.</p>
