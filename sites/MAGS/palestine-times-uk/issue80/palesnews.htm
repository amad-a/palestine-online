<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Concern Over Al Aqsa Mosque Rises</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Palestinian leaders representing various political orientations
have warned that Jerusalem's al Aqsa Mosque is facing the danger of destruction
at the hands of Jewish extremists, possibly in connivance with certain circles
in the Israeli Government.  The renewed Palestinian concern was voiced following
the disclosure by the former Israeli Police Inspector Assaf Hefets on New
Year's eve that extremist Jewish elements affiliated with the Messianic
Gush Emunim movement were planning to destroy the al Aqsa Mosque and the
Dome of the Rock for the purpose of &quot;rebuilding the Temple of Solomon
on their sites and accelerating the process of redemption for the Jewish
people.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hefets didn't give any details, but signalled that the
&quot;aspirations&quot; of the &quot;extremist elements&quot; ought to be
taken seriously by the political authority in Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Hebrew press reported that extremist elements
confessed of having rented a flat overlooking al Aqsa Mosque which they
hoped to use as a launching pad for firing rockets on Muslim worshippers
during the current holy month of Ramadan. The would-be-perpetrators reportedly
hoped to kill as many Palestinians as possible, which would in turn spark
off more violence and bloodshed, a condition viewed by the sages of Gush
Emunim as a necessary requirement for &quot;the appearance of the saviour&quot;
and achievement of &quot;redemption.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hefets' revelations coincided with the arrest of two other
Gush Emunim members for plotting to launch a pig's head into the Haram al
Sharif compound also during the month of Ramadan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Haidar Abdul Shafi, a legislative council member and outstanding
Gazan figure, said he was not surprised by the &quot;grave&quot; revelations
because the &quot;ambitions of these movements are well-known and border
on madness.&quot; He argued that the vital question now is &quot;what Palestinians,
Arabs and Muslims ought to do to forestall their heinous designs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;All our holy shrines are in danger and I can't really
overestimate the gravity of the situation ... I'm afraid that one day we
will wake up to the sad news that al Aqsa Mosque has been demolished,&quot;
Abdul Shafi said in a telephone interview with <I>Palestine Times.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Muhammed Hussein, Director-General of the Haram
al Sharif compound, described the foiled plot as &quot;characteristic of
Zionist thinking.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;They make no secret of their aspirations to destroy
Islamic holy places in Jerusalem in order to rebuild a Jewish temple on
their ruins.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, Hamas reacted strongly to Hefets' revelations.
 Dr. Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, the Movement's principal spokesman in Gaza,
accused &quot;the Israeli State of harbouring definite designs toward Islamic
holy places.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;The collective Israeli State is involved in this
evil scheme ... the subterranean tunnels they are digging beneath the mosque
testify to their sinister designs,&quot; Rantisi told <I>PT</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reflecting a sense of frustration and bitterness at the
grim prospect, Rantisi demanded that Muslims &quot;wake up before it is
too late.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;The Israeli occupation of Jerusalem was a great
catastrophe for Muslims; the destruction of the al Aqsa Mosque now in the
full view of over a billion Muslims would be even a greater catastrophe,&quot;
he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 2 January, as many as 170,000 Palestinians descended
on the al Aqsa Mosque to perform the first Friday prayer in Ramadan. There
they listened to a fiery speech by Sheikh Hamed Beitawi, who warned the
Israeli authorities and Jewish extremists against &quot;any miscalculations.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He further warned that &quot;the destruction of the al
Aqsa would also mean the destruction of Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;We would burn the ground under your feet if anything
happened to our mosque,&quot; alluding to suicidal bomb attacks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the following Friday, around 200,000 people showed up,
taking advantage of the unseasonably good weather and of relaxed Israeli
restrictions on Palestinian entry into East Jerusalem during the month of
Ramadan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two recent disclosures about Jewish plots against the
al Aqsa Mosque coincided with a shocking revelation also pertaining to the
mosque. The Hebrew daily Ha'eretz quoted the Israeli army commander of the
Central Region during the 1967 war, Major General Uzi Narkis, who died recently,
as saying that the army's former chief Rabbi, Shlomo Goren, suggested to
him that he deposit 100 kg of TNT beneath the Dome of the Rock and get it
destroyed &quot;once and for all.&quot;  According to Ha'eretz, Narkis intimated
that Goren broached persistently on the matter, saying &quot;Uzi, this is
the time to get 100 kg of explosives inside the Dome of Rock and it will
go once and forever.&quot;  Shocked by Goren's persistence, Narkis reportedly
told Goren &quot;Rabbi, stop this.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Goren was a founding father of Gush Emunim, which later
bred such cardinal terrorists and racists as Baruch Goldstein and Meir Kahane
(the former murdered 29 Muslim worshippers at the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron
and the latter founded Kach).&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The movement fiercely opposed the peace process between
Israel and the Palestinians on the ground that peace would postpone or slow
down the process of redemption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, followers often seek to initiate attacks on Palestinians
and Muslim holy places in East Jerusalem in the hope that this would generate
violence, which in turn would induce redemption.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub weakened</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are increasing signs that the controversial head
of the PA Preventive Security Force (PSF), Colonel Jebril Rajoub, is falling
into disfavour with Chairman Arafat and much of the Fatah establishment.
On 10 January, a street melee erupted in Hebron between high-ranking Preventive
Security and members of the &quot;Special Forces&quot; responsible to Ghazi
Jabali, a stalwart supporter of Arafat. The melee nearly evolved into an
armed confrontation were it not for taxi drivers and street-goers who intervened
to separate the factions vying for influence in the street. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, Rajoub was reportedly harshly rebuked by Arafat
following a similar incident in Nablus.  According to Palestinian sources,
Rajoub supporters forced two prominent Fatah leaders, Sakher Habash and
Hakam Bala'awi, both members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, out of
a rally celebrating the annual anniversary of the movement. Habash and Bala'awi
reportedly protested the conspicuous absence of Yasser Arafat's portraits,
prompting Rajoub's supporters to &quot;eject them.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub's membership in the Revolutionary Council was &quot;suspended&quot;
for eight months last month after he reportedly used &quot;obscene and derogatory&quot;
language against Habash.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub was until recently viewed as a major candidate for
successor to Yasser Arafat.  However, on 18 January, the Israeli media quoted
&quot;reliable Palestinian sources&quot; as saying that Rajoub had submitted
his resignation to Arafat.  Rajoub denied the Israeli reports, saying they
were part of an Israeli campaign aimed at &quot;distorting the image of
the Preventive Security and its leadership.&quot; </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Sheikh Yasin: I won't recognize Israel; the
Oslo Agreement was born dead</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, founder and spiritual mentor of
Hamas, is unrelentingly opposed to &quot;any dialogue with the entity of
oppression (Israel) because this would lead nowhere.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Yasin spoke last week with the Israeli-Arabic</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> <B>weekly Sawt al Haq wal Hurriyya. </B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The following are excerpts of what he said:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Question: There is a lot of vagueness concerning the
political course of Hamas. Does the Movement want to remain a military organization
or combine armed struggle with political action?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Answer: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> To begin with, there
is no movement the world over that adopts military struggle without having
political goals because the former is always entwined with the latter. We
at Hamas have a very clear policy. We want to recover our rights and establish
our Palestinian State. Politics is the means with which we deal with all
States and organizations. Hence, we adopted the principle of a step-by-step
solution provided that Israel leave the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East
Jerusalem in return for a &quot;hudna&quot; or an extended truce.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: But from a political viewpoint, does Hamas absolutely
reject the principle of talks or negotiations with Israel?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I object to the wording
of your question for two reasons: first, I don't recognize Israel and am
unwilling to talk to her because such a thing would imply recognition; second,
we are careful not to allow the Zionist entity to exhaust us as they exhausted
the PLO. Moreover, if the Israelis are serious about peace, why don't they
just leave us alone and leave our land. Look, they have given the PLO nothing
despite the huge concessions to them by the PA. This (negotiations with
Israel) is a route fraught with deception and equivocation, and we are not
willing to give it any consideration.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: I am saying in case an offer is made to Hamas?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I'm not willing to divide
the Palestinian cause into small fragments.  I won't recognize Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Do you support any progress in the talks such as
extending Palestinian authority to more land and releasing Palestinian prisoners?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I don't mind releasing prisoners,
but you have got to remember that the PA has conceded everything to the
Israelis.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Is there any room for reconciling military struggle
against Israel with PA opposition to it?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>Reconciling the irreconcilable
is very difficult, indeed. We are supposed to resist the occupation and
the PA is resisting the resistance. However, we are doing everything possible
to avoid any unnecessary friction with the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: So the PA is insisting on its rejection of any armed
struggle against Israel?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The peace process has now
reached a dead-end. In the past, the PA harboured certain hopes and therefore
moved against us. Now, these hopes have evaporated, so, moving against us
anew would be meaningless and unacceptable.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Does the PA benefit from Hamas' military struggle?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Certainly.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Don't you see a certain inconsistency in Hamas' policy?
On the one hand you are continuing the struggle, on the other you are careful
not to &quot;collide&quot; with the PA?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> There is no inconsistency
Our policy is very clear. We want to fight our oppressors; the PA rejects
this. What we want from the PA is to realize that we are not against it
and we won't fight it despite the fact the PA is siding with the enemy against
us as demonstrated in the torture to which our brothers were subjected in
PA jails and detention centres.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: The PA says you want to destroy its national dream?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> This is not true; Hamas
doesn't want to destroy the PA; the moment Hamas points its guns at or on
the PA, you can say something like this. We are against the occupier and
the PA is utterly unable to remove the occupier's oppression from our land.
The right to resist the occupation is absolutely legitimate.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Why won't Hamas give the PA a respite for one or
two years to take its chance?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> We didn't sign the Oslo
Accords and were not a part to it. In any case, the Accords were born dead,
so you can't give a dead body a chance. The only chance it deserves is to
allow it to be buried.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: What is the alternative, then?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA has made a big blunder,
hence it now faces an unenviable situation. Undoing Oslo and resuming the
intifadah is the alternative.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Since your release from prison, the PA is ignoring
you.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> We make our views known
through the media.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: What is the national programme of Hamas?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas is established on
the ground with its social, educational and other institutions. Even Islamists,
who work within the PA, are active in building for the future. However,
the PA doesn't accord us freedom to serve our people.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Hamas leaders claim there is total separation between
the political and military wings of the Movement, is this true?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>This is not true. Our political
line is unequivocal, and our brothers in the military wing understand that.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Will Hamas continue to be a secret movement?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hamas is a fighting movement,
and Jihad requires a great deal of secrecy.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q: Do you have a message for Arafat?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A:  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>Reconsider your calculations.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Fourth Anniversary Of Hebron Massacre</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To assume that the man who so cold-bloodedly massacred
Muslim worshippers during the dawn prayer at the Ibrahimi mosque on February
25, 1994 in Hebron was demented is an easy way of dismissing one of the
major factors contributing to the obstacles preventing peace between the
Israelis and Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The massacre occurred shortly before 5 a.m. when the mosque
was crowded with worshippers for the dawn prayers during the Holy month
of Ramadan. And though the former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called
this heinous crime, &quot;a murderous act by a psychopath,&quot; as if it
were only the evil deed of a crazed man and nothing else, it was so much
more than that. Further, let us not assume Baruch Goldstein, who was an
American immigrating to Israel from New York was a deranged person. He had
carefully calculated what he did and was in fact a major in the Israeli
army as well as a medical doctor.  Medical doctors take an oath to save
lives yet Goldstein was responsible for the deaths of more than 50 people,
including children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When he attacked the worshippers at dawn that fateful Friday
four years ago, he indiscriminately fired two clips of a machine-gun into
the faithful who bent their heads in prayer. More than 300 people were injured
during the attack. Israeli soldiers positioned at the mosque at the time
of the incident fired teargas and guarded the entrances, making  the evacuation
of dead and injured impossible. It is for this reason that no ambulances
were able to reach the scene of this massacre until nearly one hour later,
making the number of fatal casualties even higher.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But let it be remembered that Goldstein knew very well
what he was doing. Hebron is the only place in the West Bank where Jewish
settlers live in the heart of an Arab city. Those Israelis who choose to
live outside Israel proper do so because of generous government subsidies
intended to encourage the colonization of Arab lands seized in the 1967
war. Most of these settlers in such enclaves are extremists who with the
support of the Israeli government, are determined to wipe out the indigenous
Arab population in order to make room for more settlements. These Jewish
extremists are legally sanctioned, given arms by the Israeli government
and are often as in the case of Goldstein, directly supported by the Israeli
military.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli extremists are often funded by private contributions
from America and a lot of substantial subsidies come from the U.S. government.
And while these extremists are bent in driving out or killing Palestinians,
the Israeli government is building more and more settlements which are in
violation of international law and are illegal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even though more than 50 worshippers died in the Ibrahimi
mosque four years ago, others were injured or killed when they tried to
rush the injured to hospitals or bury them.  They were shot at by the Israeli
military. Added to this, demonstrations broke out all over the Gaza Strip
and West Bank cities increasing the number of dead and injured.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To intensify hard feelings, the U.S. successfully blocked
an effort by the UN Security Council to dispatch a multi-national peace
keeping force to the occupied territories so that further violence would
not erupt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Though the world can little remember what was said at the
Ibrahimi mosque, it can never forget what Goldstein and his cohorts did
there. It is difficult to pretend to establish peace on such a shaky foundation.
Dead and  injured Palestinians are not likely to provide a basis for any
kind of peace negotiations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In order for peace to be concrete and real, settlements
must be stopped and people like Goldstein either imprisoned or shipped out
of the country.  The murderer died by his own sword for he was killed by
one of the faithful and did not live to face the consequences of his evil
action. People like Goldstein have hearts eaten away by hate. Unfortunately,
the victims of such people are the innocent.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The day the faithful martyrs were buried, a wave of rage
swept over what little is left of Palestine. That rage still has to be quelled
for every day, more Palestinian blood is shed on Palestinian soil, new victims
fall prey to Israeli atrocities, and the confiscation of Arab land continues
until there will be nothing left of Palestine at all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Four years later let us solemnly remember the innocent
who were slain or injured. As we lay flowers on their graves, we must pray
that such atrocities will not happen again and that the so-called peace
talks will not be the relinquishment of further Palestinian soil, nor the
building of new settlements, but a just and lasting peace that is available
to all.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Amnesty condemns trial of two Hamas activists</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman (J.T.)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Amnesty International
last month condemned  the 19 January trial of two Hamas activists accused
of having set up a bomb factory in Nablus north of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Nasser Abul Rous, and Jasser Salameh were tried within
days of their arrest, in a summary trial before the State Security Court
in Jericho. The trial was held before military judges, with a military prosecutor,
under the PLO code of 1979- up to now only used against members of the security
services. The public were barred from the half-hour trial. The court appointed
a military lawyer to represent the two defendants, and lawyers offering
to represent the defendants were not allowed into the court except to hear
the sentences of 15 years imprisonment with hard labour, the statement said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;No one can tell whether those arrested are guilty
or innocent when they are tried in such a way,&quot; Amnesty said. &quot;These
abuses undermine the judicial system and are a denial of justice.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Amnesty also condemned the Palestinian Authority's prolonged
detention without charge or trial of more than 150 suspected Islamist members
of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Some of these detainees have been held for
more than a year while orders from the attorney general or the Palestinian
High Court to release specific detainees against whom no charges had been
filed and no evidence produced have been ignored, the statement continued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;After the Palestinian High Court ordered the immediate
release, on grounds of unlawful detention, of Sheikh Mahmoud Musleh, a Hamas
activist, in December 1997, he was taken for a short walk and then brought
back to prison. He was told that he had been rearrested. That makes a mockery
of the law,&quot; Amnesty said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the context of the peace accords, Israel has put increasing
pressure on the PA to &quot;fulfill its commitments to fight terrorism&quot;
by, among other things, &quot;the apprehension, prosecution and punishment
of terrorists.&quot; The Israeli government has used the issue of &quot;terrorism&quot;
as an excuse for allowing the Israeli General Security Service to use practices
which constitute torture during interrogation and for holding over 300 Palestinians
in administrative detention without trial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;It is now time for the PA and Israel to accept that
a government's legitimate right to fight crime and violence can only be
carried out with due respect for human rights, &quot; Amnesty said. &quot;The
international community, particularly the United States, which is brokering

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian human rights group denies persecution
of Christians</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (AP)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Christians
living under Palestinian Authority (PA) rule do not face systematic persecution,
a Palestinian human rights group said, dismissing claims by the Israeli
government and some evangelical Christians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG),
which is often sharply critical of PA's human rights record, said reports
alleging persecution were a &quot;deliberate manipulation&quot; aimed at
defaming the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The group convened a news conference last month to release
its new report, &quot;For the record: The 'persecution' of Christians under
the Palestinian Authority.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We believe that the Christians of Palestine are not
being persecuted at all,&quot; said Charles Lenchner, a member of the group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report said the allegations of persecution were being
made by the International Christian Embassy, a staunchly pro Israeli group
based in Jerusalem, and by the government of Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu.
The Christian Embassy alleged Palestinian converts to Christianity are being
systematically harassed by the PA. It cited cases involving several recent
converts to Christianity, including Mohammed Baker, an engineering from
the Nablus area, who was arrested by Palestinian police last summer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Christian Embassy has said Baker was targeted because
of his faith. However, the Palestinian human rights group said last month
that Baker was arrested during a sweep of land dealers suspected of having
sold land to Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The charges against him may be false, but this does
not mean that the real reason for his arrest was his Christianity,&quot;
the report said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Representatives of the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem visited
Baker in a Nablus prison. A consulate official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Baker acknowledged having served as a witness during a sale
of West Bank land to Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the Christian Embassy said last month it stood
by its allegations. David Parsons, a spokesman for the group, said the Palestinian
human rights activists were losing their credibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In its report, the human rights group took a look at five
cases it said had repeatedly come up in media reports, and concluded that
in two of the cases, there was evidence of harassment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In one of the cases, a 25 year-old Palestinian convert
was arrested repeatedly on suspicion of collaboration with Israel and in
a second, a 31 year-old was ostracised in his overwhelmingly Muslim village.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The human rights violations are occurring at a local
level, and not as a result of Palestinian Authority policies against Christians,&quot;
the report said, adding that it has found no other evidence of harassment.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian leaders blame Algerian government
and army for carnage</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (13 January) </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian leaders representing various political orientations
have blamed the Algerian government and army for the continuing pogroms
in that Arab Muslim North African country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamed al Beitawi, a prominent Islamic figure from Nablus,
said in a telephone interview he was convinced that &quot;special units
of the Algerian army and paramilitary groups, armed and backed by the government,&quot;
were responsible for the bulk of the massacres of innocent civilians in
the Algerian countryside.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;All indications suggest that the Algerian authorities
and army are actively involved in these abominable acts of savagery,&quot;
Beitawi said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He cited persistent refusal by the Algerian government
to accept any neutral international inquiry into the massacres, which he
said proves that the authorities &quot;have something to conceal from the
world and the Algerian people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Why hasn't the Algerian government arrested and tried
any of the murderers so that the true identity of the savages is established...and
why hasn't the Algerian army moved to save wailing women and children in
the vicinity of the army camps and garrisons,&quot; Beitawi wondered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rafik al Natshe, former PLO ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
also criticized the Algerian government for &quot;giving the army free rein
to butcher civilians.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Natshe pointed out that the Algerian army was behaving
as a militia, not as an &quot;army of the people&quot; as its official title
suggests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Natshe also called on the Algerian government to &quot;immediately
initiate a dialogue with the opposition, including the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas recently renewed its condemnation of the ghastly
massacres, holding the Algerian government responsible for them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ismael Abu Shanab, a Movement leader in Gaza, said he was
sure the pro-government militias and some army units were responsible for
most of the killings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the second week of January, Hamas issued a leaflet
blaming &quot;French agents in Algeria&quot; for seeking to &quot;kill Islam
in Algeria.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish terrorists threatens to kill Christian
peacemakers</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The Jewish terrorist organization, known as Kach, has
threatened to kill members of an American Christian Peace Team (CPT) based
in the West Bank of Hebron if they fail to leave the West Bank within 96
hours.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the CPT director, Gene Stoltzfus, the team
received e-mail messages signed by Kach in the United States and the West
Bank with the subject heading &quot;Swift Punishment&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One message read &quot;it has been learned that three of
your members help and assist Arab terrorists in smuggling explosives.  For
their safety, the above-mentioned terrorists (the Christians) are advised
to depart from the Land of Israel to their own countries in the next 96
hours.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, Stoltzfus retrieved a similar message from the
answering machine at the CPT Chicago office that added &quot;as a humanitarian
effort to save their lives, we ask you to evacuate them from Israel before
21 January. After that date their lives will be in jeopardy. This is a warning.
 This is a last warning. Bye.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The CPT reacted by alerting the FBI and several American
congressmen and senators to the Kach threats.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The CPT held a press conference at Hebron City Hall in
Hebron where they denounced the &quot;terrorist movement for spreading lies
about us and for trying to intimidate us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the team issued a statement exposing the real
motives behind Kach threats against them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement read: &quot;This threat came from an outlawed
Jewish terrorist organization that has in the past brutally killed people.
 So, we take this threat very seriously. However, we will continue to support
Palestinians and Israelis who are non-violently resisting the military occupation
of the West Bank.  Yesterday (19 January), we received just a taste of what
the Palestinians face daily. They must face the terror that the occupation
brings at checkpoints, settlers with M-16s, or bulldozers coming to destroy
the family house.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CPT lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab, said the threats ought to
be taken seriously given the terroristic and murderous history of Kach,
including the murder of Alex Udeh, director of the Arab-American Anti-defamation
League in California.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kuttab said the murderers, Robert and Miryam Manning, were
still fugitives hiding in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba'a near Hebron.

bombings</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- The Islamic
Resistance Movement, Hamas, has discounted Israeli allegations that two
of its members were on their way to carry out a suicide bomb attack in West
Jerusalem on 26 January.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Movement's premier spokesman in Gaza, Abdul Aziz al
Rantisi, said the Israeli allegations didn't reflect the truth and were
motivated by political and public relations considerations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;We are accustomed to hearing concocted misinformation
and lies from the Israelis for the purpose of justifying their torment against
our people,&quot; said Rantisi in a telephone interview from his Gaza home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi said he, as a political leader of Hamas, was not
acquainted with the activities of the Islamist Movement's military wing,
known as the Ezzidin al Qassam Brigades.  However, he was sure the Israeli
reports were concocted for political reasons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;They want to blackmail the extremely weak and vulnerable
Palestinian Authority into giving further concessions and carrying out sweeping
arrests among Islamic activists,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli police spokesperson had announced on 26 January
that two Palestinians arrested at dawn of the same day might have been on
their way to carry out a suicide bomb attack in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spokesperson also revealed that the apprehension of
the two Palestinians was made possible thanks to information relayed to
the Israeli intelligence by the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Police sources said explosives were confiscated along with
the two people, but gave no further details.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Police and security forces in the Zionist State have been
placed on high alert to forestall possible attacks by Palestinian Islamists
on targets inside Israel.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish militants indicted for plan to throw
pig head into Al Aqsa Mosque</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Tel Aviv</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - Two Jewish extremists
were indicted on 14 January on charges of inciting violence for planning
to throw a pig's head into the Al Aqsa Mosque in a bid to damage Arab-Israeli
ties, court officials said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Avigdor Askin and Damain Pakovich are also accused of placing
a pig's head on the tomb of Palestinian hero Izzedine Al Qassam in northern
of the Occupied Palestine and of setting fire to the offices of a pro-peace
group, a court spokesman said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Police allege Askin planned the acts and Pakovich carried
them out as part of a plan to use pigs heads, considered unclean by Muslims,
to ignite Palestinian anger and harm Arab-Israeli relations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The suspects planned to cause tension between Jews
and Arabs through provocative actions that would cause serious damage to
relations between Arab Muslims and Jews,&quot; the state prosecutor wrote
in the charge sheet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two Russian immigrants were arrested in December for
planning to launch, from a distance, a pig's head into the Al Aqsa Holy
Mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, during prayers for the
Holy Month of Ramadan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Police accuse the two of wanting to spark violence to derail
plans by the Israeli government to withdraw troops from parts of occupied
areas of the West Bank.</FONT></P>

him as an agent in exchange for his release. He had earlier accused his
interrogators of torturing him.</FONT></P>

with PA</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a rare recognition of the depth of security coordination
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Israel lauded &quot;genuine
Palestinian cooperation with the PA security apparatus in foiling planned
attacks on Israeli targets.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli deputy chief of staff, Major General Uzi Dayan,
said joint and concerted Israeli-PA efforts enabled both sides to apprehend
Islamist activists bent on carrying out &quot;terrorist operations&quot;
against Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking during a news conference in Tel Aviv on 13 January,
Dayan disclosed that PA security agents acted on information conveyed to
them by the Israeli Intelligence known as Shin Bet when they raided an explosives
factory in Nablus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dayan didn't say when the raid took place, but Palestinian
sources in Nablus confirmed that as many as six Islamist activists were
arrested on 11 and 13 January.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 12 January, Shin Bet head, Amy Ayalon, met in Ramallah
with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat and thanked him for &quot;cooperation with
Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel considers the &quot;security dimension&quot; as
the foundation of the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other developments reflecting further hardening of the
Israeli position, the Israeli government said that the PA would have to
carry out three steps before the second phase of redeployment took place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These include ending &quot;incitement&quot; against Israel
and Jewish settlers in the Palestinian media, extraditing Islamist detainees
to Israeli authorities and revoking the Palestinian charter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government secretary Danny Naveh announced
the three demands in a press conference in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Naveh said the three demands would be treated as &quot;pre-conditions&quot;
for the implementation of the second phase of redeployment in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian leaders reacted angrily to the new Israeli
demands.</FONT></P>

them as &quot;additional means to enable Netanyahu to evade the agreements.&quot;</FONT></P>

300,000 Palestinians attended prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque on the last Friday
in the holy month of Ramadan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In his sermon, Sheikh Ikrema Sabri said the large number
of worshippers who attended the prayers at Al Aqsa was &quot;a clear message
to the Jewish Occupation that Al Quds will belong only to its true people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These hundreds of thousands of Muslim Palestinians
who came from all parts of Palestine assert the Islamism of Jerusalem and
its Holy Mosque. We have heard the siren warning of the dangers which threaten
our city, from the destruction of our homes and the building of settlements,
while the Jerusalemites live in suffering,&quot; said Sheikh Sabri.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Sabri called on the Arab and Muslim nations to rebel
against the United Nations sanctions against Iraq and to provide assistance
to Iraqi children who die because of the insufficient food and medical supplies
as a result of the implementation of the United Nations resolutions. He
described these resolutions as illegitimate according to Islamic measures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Sabri also called on the Arabs and Muslims all over
the world to save Algeria from the massacres, which are alleged, falsely,
to be perpetuated by Islamic groups.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The prayers were held under heavy Israeli security measures
for the last Friday of the Holy Month of Ramadan. Al Aqsa compound is the
third holiest place in Islam after Mecca Al Mukaramma and Al Madina Al Munawarra.</FONT></P>

detainees</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gaza (QP)- The Palestinian Human Rights Centre condemned
a ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court allowing the Israeli Shin Bet security
service to use physical and mental torture against Palestinian prisoners.
The Israeli Court on 12 January rejected a petition by Abdel Rahman Ghuneimat,
a Hamas member, to stop being tortured by the Shin Bet. The Court's decision
allowed the Shin Bet to continue torturing Palestinian prisoners by suspending
them with their hands and legs tied behind, preventing them from sleeping
and covering their heads with dirty sacks as well as the use of violent
shaking. The last method of torture led to the death of Abdel Samad Heraizat
in April 1995. The Centre said the Court's ruling provides the Israeli security
services with  &quot;legal&quot; coverage and protection.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bethlehem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Palestinian lawyers
and human rights advocates expressed indignation at the continued detention
by the Israeli Occupation of more than 4,000 Palestinians, despite the fact
that the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO were signed in 1993, reported
Ahmad Sayad, the Director of Mandela for Human Rights, in a workshop organized
in Bethlehem. Mr. Sayad said the detainees have their human rights violated
in the Israeli jails. He pointed out that about 1,500 Palestinians have
been arrested by the Israeli authorities since the signing of the Oslo Accords.
&quot;Israel is using the detainees as an instrument to pressure the Palestinian
negotiators and to get more relinquishments from the PA in the peace negotiations,&quot;
Mr. Sayad said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Suha Barhgouthi, wife of Ahmed Qatamish, who has been in
&quot;administrative detention&quot; (detention without trial) for several
years, said the administrative detention is a kind of mass punishment affecting
not only the detainees but also their families. &quot;The Israeli government
plays on the nerves of the detainees by renewing their detention for another
period just when they are told to prepare themselves for release. Prisoners
who finish their terms are referred to administrative detention. There are
900 detainees in this situation,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>

harassing Palestinians in the area and expanding their settlements under
protection by the Occupation soldiers. It accused the Occupation authorities
of going ahead with the demolition of Palestinian houses and preventing
Palestinians from improving their living conditions through the consequent
closures, resulting in about 50% of the Palestinian work force becoming
unemployed.</FONT></P>
