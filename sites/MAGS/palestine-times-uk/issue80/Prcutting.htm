<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yasser Arafat at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum? That
was the  brainstorm of Dennis Ross and Aaron Miller, the State Department's
top  Middle East negotiators. They wanted Arafat to visit America's foremost
 memorial to the victims of the Nazis in the belief, The Washington Post
 reported, that it would help him ''understand the fears of an adversary
 he has experienced primarily as a regional superpower.'' Arafat agreed
to go - if the museum rolled out the red carpet and  welcomed him as a head
of state. But the Palestinian Authority that  Arafat rules is not a state,
and the museum declined to treat him as  more than a private visitor, albeit
one who would be ''received with the  greatest courtesy.'' In a huff, Arafat
said he wouldn't go. <B>The Boston Globe, January 22, 1998</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli court ruled Wednesday that a Jewish ultranationalist
accused  of plotting to throw a pig's head onto one of Islam's holiest sites
be  released to house arrest pending trial, a court official said. Avigdor
Eskin, arrested several times in the past on suspicion of  incitement, was
ordered to post $143,000 bail, the official said. Jerusalem police have
said the alleged plan to throw the pig's head at  an area of Muslim shrines
in the holy city's Temple Mount complex  (Al Aqsa Mosque) would  have sparked
widespread bloodshed. <B>The Chicago Tribune,  January 22, 1998</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amid the rocks of the Wadi Selouki (south of Lebanon) lie
three dead men. Rajeh Aidi, Samer Balluli and Saleh al-Jadaa have been there
since 24 October, the day when their Islamic Jihad guerrilla operation against
Israeli occupation troops went fatally wrong. All three - Aidi was Lebanese,
the other two Palestinian were shot dead in a gun battle and within hours,
the United Nations and the International Red Cross asked the Israelis for
permission to retrieve the bodies for burial. Despite repeated requests,
the UN says it never even received a reply. The Red Cross confirms it was
refused permission to collect the corpses for &quot;security&quot; reasons.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Clinton administration pressed Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat  yesterday to accept an American-drafted package of security measures
to  halt political violence against Israel, and President Clinton committed
 in return to insist that Israel hand over at least 10 percent of the  West
Bank in the coming phase of troop withdrawals, according to  participants
in the top-level meetings and other sources. Clinton's territorial pledge
was the most specific by the president to  date and put him squarely at
odds with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin  Netanyahu, who left Washington
Wednesday night without agreeing to the  double-digit American benchmark.
But accounts from U.S., Palestinian and  Israeli officials suggested that
Arafat, too, is resisting Clinton's  bottom-line proposals on security,
which are being cast as part of a  package deal. <B>The Washington Post,
 January 23, 1998 </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that the
United States is  working on a proposal for Israel to pull out of 12 percent
of the West  Bank in three stages over an 80-day period in return for a
Palestinian  crackdown on Islamic militants. Netanyahu and Arafat each met
with President Clinton in Washington last  week to try to bridge gaps over
implementing last year's U.S.-backed  agreement, in which Israel pledged
three more troop pullbacks in the  West Bank by mid-1998. <B>The Chicago
Tribune, January 26, 1998</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>President Clinton's sexual behaviour, it now seems, may
tilt the balance from peace to war in the Middle East. Every front-page
headline in the Arab world has grasped this point. True, President Clinton
might try to distract Americans by launching yet another strike against
Baghdad for its non-compliance with UN weapons inspectors; even if he found
military reason to do so, however, no one in the Middle East would believe
that the timing was coincidental.  Yet far more serious is the fact that
the US president -who never did more than complain privately to Israel about
its wish to destroy the Oslo agreement - no longer has the slightest leverage
over the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. 	<B>The Independent,
