<H3><CENTER>Why do so many Palestinians object to the Wye Plantation
agreement?</CENTER></H3>

<P>The Wye Plantation agreement, signed in an impressive White
House ceremony on 23 October, was the consummate outcome of 18
months of intermittent talks between Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority and Benyamin Netanyahu's Israeli Government. It stipulates
a redeployment of the Israeli occupation army from 13.1% of the
West Bank, 3 % of which will be converted into a &quot;nature
reserve&quot; under joint Palestinian-Israeli control. Moreover,
the Palestinians will not be free to build houses in the nature
reserve, suggesting the Israeli withdrawal is only a token and
symbolic in nature.<BR>
When and if the agreement is implemented, the area under PA exclusive
and partial control will increase to 40% of the West Bank, including
17% (area A) and 23% (area B). Now, the PA has full control over
only 3% of the West Bank.<BR>
In return, the agreement requires the PA to take several draconian
measures against Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo Accords,
particularly the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas. According
to Palestinian and Israeli sources, the security annex attached
to the agreement stipulates unprecedented draconian measures against
&quot;terrorist groups&quot; and their infrastructure.<BR>
This conceivably includes charitable, educational and youth institutions
run by or associated with the Islamist movement and other anti-Oslo
organizations. Predictably, this could bring the originally uneasy
PA-Hamas relations to an unprecedented level of tension. What
makes the prospects of a collision more likely than anytime in
the past is the fact that the agreement makes a conditional relationship
between the phased Israeli redeployment and the measures taken
by the PA against Hamas. Thus, according to the agreement, the
Israeli redeployment will be carried out in several phases, depending
on the extent and scope of PA measures against the opposition
as stipulated in the Wye Plantation accords.<BR>
Thus, aside from the security pact, which many observers believe
will result in serious human rights violations in the occupied
territories, most Palestinians seem to be already indignant at
the &quot;submissive terms&quot; of the agreement, including the
following:<BR>
<B><U>First: </U></B>The third phase of redeployment. The agreement
virtually ignored the third phase, considered the most important
of the three redeployment phases stipulated in the Oslo Accords.
Faced with adamant Israeli refusal to withdraw from further territory
in the West Bank, the Palestinian leadership apparently succumbed
to Israeli intransigence, effectively agreeing to phase out the
third phase and go straight to the final status talks.<BR>
The dilution or obliteration of the third phase was done in a
way enabling both sides to claim victory. The Palestinians claim
they didn't give in on the third phase, arguing that a bi-lateral
committee would discuss the matter. For their part, the Israelis
insist they wouldn't withdraw from more than 1% of the West Bank
in the context of the third phase, a clear trivialization of the
matter. Nevertheless, the consent by the Israelis and the Palestinians
to begin final status talks before and without the third phase
suggests that the Palestinians caved in.  According to the Oslo
Accords, the Israeli army is supposed to vacate the entirety of
the West Bank by the end of the third phase, with the exceptions
of East Jerusalem, the settlements and the military positions.<BR>
Theoretically, this would have left the Palestinians with as much
as 80% of the West Bank ahead of the final status talks. In other
words, the Palestinians would be in a strong negotiating position
vis-&agrave;-vis the final status talks. However, now with the
third phase practically phased out, the Israelis have succeeded
in forcing the Palestinians into an inferior position ahead of
the final status talks. Hence, Palestinian disappointment and
indignation.<BR>
<B><U>Second: </U></B>The Palestinian National Charter. The Wye
Plantation agreement obliges PA chairman Yasser Arafat to convene
a special session of the Palestine National Council (PNC) in order
to formally rescind the National Charter. The rescinding of the
Charter at this time amounts to stripping the Palestinian people
of the remaining cards still in their hands. What makes this especially
lamentable is the fact that there is no Israeli reciprocity in
return for the canceling of the Charter. For example, Israel has
not recognized the right of the Palestinian people to freedom,
Statehood and self-determination.  In short, the annulment of
the Palestinian Charter can thus be considered a serious concession
by the Palestinian Authority.<BR>
<B><U>Third:</U></B> The Palestinian prisoners. According to the
Wye Plantation agreement, Israel will release only 750 Palestinian
prisoners out of over 3,000 prisoners languishing in Israeli jails.
This means that as many as 2,250 prisoners will remain behind
bars in Israel, most of whom are identified with the Islamic movements
and other secular groups opposed to the Oslo Accords. According
to the Hebron Agreement, Israel should free virtually all Palestinian
prisoners before the beginning of the final status talks, which
will begin in the first week of November, according to the Wye
Plantation agreement.<BR>
<B><U>Fourth:</U></B> The Palestinian State. For many months,
Yasser Arafat has been threatening to formally declare an independent
Palestinian State by 4 May 1999. However, it seems that the Palestinian
leader has abandoned plans to that effect, which suggests that
Arafat perhaps didn't really mean what he was saying to that effect
all along. The implication is very real. If Arafat agreed to lay
aside this strategic goal of the Palestinian movement, then he
likewise can be expected to extend the term of the Oslo Accords
beyond 4 May of next year. Indeed, with only seven months to that
designated date, it seems unlikely that the interim agreement
would be finalized by then. This suggests that the talks will
be dragged out for many months, even years, during which  the
Palestinian leadership would be exhausted into giving the Israelis
more and more concessions.<BR>
History<BR>
The Wye Plantation agreement should not be understood as an historical
breakthrough or anything of this sort. Indeed, the agreement doesn't
even constitute a concordance on interim issues that ought to
be settled ahead of the final status talks, which will tackle
such insurmountable subjects as the future of Jerusalem, the settlements,
the refugees, water and the borders of the would-be Palestinian
entity.<BR>
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict, after all, is not over 10% or
13% of the West Bank, but rather over Palestine itself.<BR>
Indeed, one could say candidly that the agreement, if implemented,
will only bring the two parties, and the world at large, closer
to the real issues, the nitty-gritty, of the conflict.</P>
