<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Martyrdom operations: The boomerang <br>
effect of Israeli oppression</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no doubt that &#147;martyrdom operations,&#148; especially in the
Palestinian context, are and will continue to be a subject of controversy for a long time
to come. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the issue at hand is far from &#147;normal,&#148; even if it
acquires a modicum of &#147;normalcy&#148; through recurrence and repetition. The awesome
psychological and human dimensions surrounding &#147;martyrdom operations&#148; penetrates
the depth of the human psyche in ways incomprehensible to ordinary people living under
ordinary conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the psychology and politics of martyrdom don&#146;t appeal to a
largely secular world that dares not see beyond the &#147;present order of things&#148; as
defined by existing world order, an inherently oblique order that is moulded and sustained
by Western, especially American, hegemony.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, much of the Western vilification of martyrdom operations in
Palestine, Lebanon and other parts of the Muslim world stems essentially from the overall
Western hostility to the political goals served by martyrdom, namely the attainment of
freedom for Palestinians and Muslims, whether in Palestine, Lebanon, Kashmir or Chechenya.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the U.S. and its Zionist-dominated media vilify and
execrate this form of struggle, not because of a perceived specific evil or wrong in it,
but rather because of enduring hostility to the political and human goals served by the
entire concept of Jihad, especially if and when it is incompatible with American
interests. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a world where right and wrong are defined in accordance with political
expediency, American and Western objections to martyrdom operations carried out by
tormented Palestinians against their Zionist tormentors become morally worthless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides, one might wonder who gave the Jewish-dominated U.S. government
and media the right to judge the world in matters of this nature. Indeed, the ugly
American record in Germany, Vietnam and later in Iraq , not to mention its genocidal
treatment of the native American Indians, utterly disqualifies this evil empire from
passing judgement on others. Moreover, the U.S., we must not forget, is the power that
enabled the racist Zionists to murder, torment and dispossess the Palestinian people with
impunity for the past five decades.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The respective records of France, Germany, Britain and the bulk of other
European countries are no better than that of the Americans, as is known to everybody.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, some self-righteous politicians might point out that martyrdom
operations inflict deaths among civilians, including children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, what about the half-million Iraqi children exterminated by the
American-led and -maintained sanction regime against decimated and bombed-out Iraq? The
helpless souls of these children shall continue to curse America until Doomsday.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Or perhaps the murderous hypocrites in Washington and London might think
that the death of innocents is wrong when the victims are white Christians and Jews, and
&#147;controversial&#148; or tolerable when they are blacks, Asians, Arabs or Muslims?
Racism has always had its strange ways of thinking! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, let us go back to the key question in this regard. Are martyrdom
operations justified or not in the Palestinian context? Indeed, can martyrdom operations
be justified under any circumstances?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, let us ask more questions: Would Hitler&#146;s victims have been
justified had they carried out &#147;suicidal-bomb attacks&#148; against the Gestapo, SS
and other organs of the Nazi death machine? Would the Algerians have been justified had
they done the same thing against the extremely diabolical French repression which
eventually murdered a million Algerians? In brief, is an individual, or a group of people,
justified in resorting to the &#147;last weapon,&#148; e.g. suicidal bombing, when
confronted by an overwhelming oppression transcending reality?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I honestly don&#146;t know how Americans, Westerners or ordinary human
beings anywhere in the world would answer such questions. But I do know that many,
probably most, Palestinians will answer them in the affirmative, if only because of the
Satanic evil meted out to Palestinian men, women and children by the Zionist death machine
which, unlike the Nazi death machine, has a potent public relations apparatus that can
turn the black into white, the criminal into a victim and a big lie into a
&#147;truth,&#148; celebrated and glorified by millions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe that martyrdom operations are morally justifiable, if only
because self-preservation is a central and fundamental human instinct. Indeed, when one is
pushed into a corner, constantly threatened with death and destruction, when one&#146;s
horizons are steadily narrowed, one is bound to resist and attack and if possible destroy
those seeking to destroy him or her. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Palestine, the evil Zionist regime is actually offering the Palestinian
people either of two choices: physical or psychological destruction on the one hand or
humiliating surrender and perpetual enslavement, on the other.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, as any dignified and proud people would do, the Palestinians
haven&#146;t and will not succumb to this overwhelming oppression, and the only way
through which they can deter the Zionists from carrying out further oppression and murder
is through these operations which the world inaccurately label as &#147;suicidal-bomb
attacks.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ironically, it is through death that death is prevented. That might sound
like a contradiction in terms, an oxymoron, if you will. However, in Palestine, this
formula seems to be working perfectly, for there is no other effective deterrent against
Zionist criminality and evil. If the world thinks there is, please let us know!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the final analysis, self-defence and self-preservation are a religious
and moral duty of the first order, however unorthodox and un-aesthetic the means employed
to achieve them may appear to the outside world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, if the world is so concerned about Israeli civilians getting
killed by Palestinian martyr-bombers, it should pressure the Zionists to stop killing
innocent Palestinians, including children, which would lead to saving of Israeli lives as
well.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the outbreak of the current Palestinian intifada against Zionist
occupation and oppression, the Zionist death machine has killed, rather callously, more
than 500 Palestinians, a third of them children, including babies as young as four months
old. This is in addition to the massive destruction of homes, property, land, orchards,
vineyards and the environment they inflicted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, what should the Palestinians do in the face of this overwhelming
evil? Should they lay down their necks to the Jews and tell them &#147;slaughter us,
please?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Should they tell their tormentors, &#147;Look, we are children of a lesser
god, and you can enslave us or do whatever you wish with us?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fortunately, this won&#146;t happen, if only because of those brave, young
men who sacrifice their souls so that their people, or as many of them as possible, will
live in freedom and dignity. May their souls rest in heaven forever.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"></i><font color="#0000FF">This is a war that Israel cannot win!</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Dr. Musil Shehada</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By replacing the M-16 used by the IDF with the F-16&#151;the most
sophisticated war-flying machine&#151;Israel is sending another deceptive signal to the
Palestinians. Sharon&#146;s entire tactic is based on the wrong premise that the Arabs
will only &#147;learn&#148; through the language of force. He acquired such a cruel
psychosis from his mentor Jabotinsky, the Zionist extremist whose picture appeared behind
him on the wall on the day of his inauguration. Any average person would learn from
history that injustice breeds violence and that oppression cannot last forever because,
regardless of the military strength of the oppressor, longing for freedom renders the
greatest armies in the world ineffective and a futile force against the determined
oppressed masses. Even if Sharon did not learn from history of the others, it surprises
many of us that he did not learn from his own history and that of his extreme Zionism. For
53 years he has been practicing the concept of peace for Israel through the use of
superior force and for the same period he has failed to bring even a glimmer of hope in
that direction. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His childish idea of using the American-made F-16 was designed not to win
him a battle against the determined Palestinian masses, but to simply try to scare and
confuse them into total submission. In the process, the Israeli leadership instead of
forcing the Palestinians into submission they have militarized further the Palestinian
people and have radicalized a whole generation of Palestinian youth. For military experts,
the use of the F-16 unveils the total frustration of Sharon in failing to bring security
to his people, a promise he made to his constituents in his pre-election campaign. The
damage caused by the F-16 was not relatively more damaging than the rockets fired by his
tanks or choppers in previous days, which lends credibility to the belief that the use of
the F-16 was nothing more than a sign of Israeli frustration for failing to extinguish the
intifada and forcing the Palestinians into total submission. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli commentators and some retired military men were united in
condemning the use of the air force. &#147;Within eight months the intifada [uprising] has
gone from M-16 rifles to F-16s,&#148; wrote Hemi Shalev in the popular <i>Ma&#146;ariv</i>
newspaper. &#147;In military terms, the F-16s achieved rather negligible results but, in
terms of diplomacy and PR, Israel bombed itself in the knee.&#148; Sharon&#146;s failure
to bring security to his people has brought down the polls against him from 57% to a
miserable 34%. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I believe that Israel is realizing that it is running out of options.
Israel cannot annex the West Bank and Gaza as such a step would contravene greatly the
exclusivity of Israel&#146;s character. Adding such a huge non-Jewish population into its
proper would only speed up the end of the Jewish character of Israel. Actually, as many
experts have shown through statistics, Israel is already confronted with a huge problem
with the unprecedented large increase of the Israeli-Arab population within Israel&#146;s
proper. Such a ticking demographic bomb would turn Israel into a bi-national State within
the next 20 to 30 years even without shooting a single bullet in the direction of Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With this in mind and the futility of Israel&#146;s use of massive force
against the Palestinians, it&#146;s no wonder that the U.S. has received the green light
from Sharon to send feelers for the resumption of the negotiations. Using the Mitchell
Report as a front to find a face-saving formula, the U.S. is pressing both sides to end
the violence and to rejoin the peace process. Such a step is not initiated to help the
Palestinians achieve their national objectives, as much as to try to wrest from the
Palestinians the very same goals as espoused by Sharon in the first place but using the
peace negotiations as the framework for such a travesty. This would be the same trick as
repeated under the Oslo Accords, when the intifada would be halted and the PA would have
to restart the negotiations from square one, but with a difference that the starting point
would not be within the framework of United Nations resolution 242 as was with Oslo but
rather with the miserable Israeli control of the status quo. Sharon can change his skin
but he cannot change his racist and expansionist Zionist ideologies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To accept such conditions would be total surrender to Israel and a
devastating disservice to the Palestinian objectives. We should not fall into this trap as
we have been tricked so many times before. We should reject even the suggestion to stop
the intifada; on the contrary, we should develop it further by our total support. Israel
should sign commitments cosigned by the UN and the U.S. and declare unequivocally to
withdraw to international borders, accept all international resolutions related to
Palestine before the rocks would stop pouring on the heads of our tormentors, as this is a
war that Israel should never be allowed to win. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Victims of the victims and the Mitchell Report</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Alison Weir is an American journalist who, half way through the intifada
(uprising), decided to travel to Palestine to see for herself who is victim and who is
aggressor. She told a Muslim audience in Santa Clara, California, that she had for so long
been busy reporting on women&#146;s issues, on the environment and on other such domestic
news until she felt she could no longer ignore TV images of Palestinian stone-throwing
children challenging Israeli troops that are fully shielded and armed to the teeth. Having
seen with her eyes, and having encountered Israeli occupation troops and lived for days
and nights in Palestinian refugee camps, she came back to America with the determination
to speak out. She wanted to tell her fellow Americans that a great injustice was being
committed against the Palestinians, victims of the victims; that such injustice is seldom
reported in the American media, where overt and covert censorship filters out any news
reports that may tell the truth because the truth is simply not in Israel&#146;s favour;
that this injustice is carried out with American tax-payers&#146; money and with the most
sophisticated American-made weaponry. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Journalists like Alison Weir are a gift from Heaven to the Palestinian
people who are in great need of every moral support they can get. There are still very few
journalists in the Western world who have the courage to sympathize with the victims and
support justice. But despite their scarcity, those who dare speak out prove to us that
there is hope that one day public opinion in the world may be freed from the shackles of
ignorance, prejudice and fear. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What Alison Weir and her brave colleagues in the world of journalism face
is a huge wall of silence erected by the Western feeling of guilt because of what had
happened to the Jews in Europe at the hands of Hitler. It is not an easy task to convince
the world that the victims of yesterday, or to be more precise those who speak for them,
are today perpetrating an equally, if not more horrible Holocaust against the
Palestinians, &#145;victims of the victims.&#146; We need not labour in order to prove
that the Palestinians are not related to Hitler or to the Germans. We need not even make a
great effort in order to show that never in their history were the Palestinians
persecutors of the Jews. Nothing is easier than proving Palestinian innocence except for
the fact that neither we nor our friends in the West have access to the public. Alison
Weir told us in her heart-breaking presentation that none of the American newspapers she
had been promised would welcome her dispatches from Jerusalem had published a single word.
Men and women of letters in America, as well as men and women in politics, collude in a
major cover-up so that American taxpayers are kept in the dark while their dollars keep
buying bullets and shells with which children like Iman Hijjo and Muhammad al-Durra are
murdered in cold blood. Indeed, it is American money that pays for the robbery by
immigrant &#145;Jewish settlers&#146; of Palestinian land to build up, or expand, their
citadels in and around Palestinian towns and villages so as to provoke them, intimidate
them and eventually force them off the land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and all the brave, justice-loving humans
around the world who support the just cause in Palestine need to work more to encourage
conversions toward their camp. The West needs dedicated professionals in the media and in
politics to awaken it from its slumber and to help it shed from its shoulders the burden
of guilt that is forcing it to support the most heinous and longest crime against humanity
in modern times.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The eye-opening and conscience-reviving discourse of supporters of justice
and truth will undoubtedly, albeit slowly, generate world sympathy for the &#145;victims
of the victims.&#146; However, the humane aspect of Palestinian suffering would have,
perhaps at a later stage when bravery becomes more abundant, to be presented with a
defence of the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance and struggle for freedom and
liberation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the face of scandalous distortions, such as that presented by the
Mitchell Report, the world needs to know that what the Palestinians are engaged in is
neither violence nor terrorism. They are clearly acting in self-defence, and one of the
noblest types. Without fear of being accused of supporting terrorism, or of being labelled
as anti-Semitic, more of us would have to stand up and cry in the face of Mitchell and his
likes: &#147;What would you do if someone were to occupy your home, rob you of your
dearest possessions and kill or mutilate your loved ones?&#148; Would a sane person ever
refer to the struggle of the Vietnamese people as an act of terrorism or would anyone
today describe Nelson Mandela as a terrorist?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a grave mistake on the part of the Palestinian Authority to accept
the recommendations of the Mitchell Report, which calls on the victims to stop protesting
while the aggressor is merely asked not to proceed further with its aggression. Israel,
who is occupying the land and oppressing its lawful owners, is said to have accepted the
report with reservation. Israel is not happy with the recommendation that further
settlement activities should be halted. It is tantamount to asking a thief to keep what he
has stolen but not to rob anymore. By accepting the Mitchell report, the Palestinian
Authority has opened the door for further compromises and perhaps for a plot to undermine
the current intifada. But turning the clock back is impossible. Nothing the Israelis may
do, or their supporters in the region or outside it, will reverse the process of
establishing justice in Palestine. The Palestinians have paid dearly and are prepared to
continue to pay with all that remains in order for land and homes to be freed from Zionist
occupation. During the current intifada, the Palestinian Authority has had a golden
opportunity to side with its people and repent from past sins of collaboration with the
enemy. If this opportunity is missed, the Authority will suffer the greatest loss in its
short history, for it, too, will go away with the occupation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <b><h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Mitchell Report: Another Fig-leaf</font></h3>
  <i><p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</p>
  </i></b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Few observers expected anything different. From the outset, it was
  open to question. The controversial selection of the Commission&#146;s members and
  omission of Nelson Mandela was one of the first signs of another diplomatic cover-up.
  Chaired by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee
  was constituted shortly after the October summit attended by Egypt, Jordan, the
  Palestinian Authority (PA), the United States, Israel, the United Nations and the European
  Union. Despite its subtle rebuke of the PA and exoneration of the Israeli government, the
  long-awaited report was warmly welcomed by the former and coldly rejected by the latter. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Both in its introduction and concluding recommendations, the Mitchell
  Report emphasized one theme that could easily be read as a press statement from Tel Aviv
  or Washington. One of the recommendations contained therein states that &#147;The PA
  should make clear through concrete action to Palestinians and Israelis alike that
  terrorism is reprehensible and unacceptable, and that the PA will make a 100 percent
  effort to prevent terrorist operations and to punish perpetrators. This effort should
  include immediate steps to apprehend and incarcerate terrorists operating within the
  PA&#146;s jurisdiction.&#148; </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">If the reader were an alien from another planet, he or she would have
  concluded that the Palestinians are the illegal occupiers of Israeli land and the
  perpetrators of collective punishment upon its civilian population. After reading the
  introductory assertion that &#147;some Palestinians appear not to comprehend the extent to
  which terrorism creates fear among the Israeli people,&#148; the reader would also get the
  impression that it is the Palestinian Authority that imposes blanket curfews on Israeli
  residential areas, denies food and medicine to their besieged towns and villages, uproots
  and destroys crops, prevents the export of their produce, and bombards their homes,
  businesses and public facilities, including educational and health facilities, with
  missiles from F-16 warplanes, helicopter gun-ships, rocket launchers and tanks. Everyone
  on this planet, however, knows this is not the case.</p>
  <b><u><p ALIGN="LEFT">One of many<br>
  </u></b>The Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee was not the first and will not be the
  last of its kind. Its report adds to a long list of other such reports that can be traced
  as far back as 1919 when U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ordered a two-man
  commission&#151;Dr. Henry King and Charles Crane&#151;to investigate and ascertain the
  wishes of the people of Syria, Palestine and Iraq. That commission found that the initial
  claim submitted by the Zionists &#147;that they have a right in Palestine based on an
  occupation of 2,000 years ago can hardly be seriously considered.&#148; They warned that
  the national home project could not be carried out except by force of arms because the
  Arab population was &#147;emphatically against the entire Zionist program.&#148; Hence,
  they recommended that the idea of an independent Jewish State in Palestine should be
  abandoned, and Jewish immigration strictly controlled. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Because of its support for the wishes of the Palestinian people, the
  King-Crane Commission report was withheld from the public until late December 1922, after
  the installation of the mandatory authority, which gave Britain the
  &#145;constitutional&#146; cover to enforce the Balfour Declaration and Judaize Palestine.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">If Britain wanted to consider the wishes of the Palestinian people, it
  certainly could have done so and spared the region many decades of turmoil. But it had no
  intention of doing that as it considered the aims of Zionism far more important than the
  rights of the Palestinian people. Following the unrests in Jerusalem (1920) and Jaffa
  (1921), two more inquiries were conducted. Both commissions (Palin and Haycraft
  respectively) highlighted the depths of popular discontent and the need for a careful
  handling of the situation in order to avert a serious catastrophe.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In the context of the current intifada, there were still two other
  commission reports of even greater significance. The first is the International Commission
  appointed by the British government in 1930 and approved by the Council of the League of
  Nations in 1931. It followed an attempt by Jewish settlers to change the status of the
  Western Wall in 1929, which resulted in bloody clashes and hundreds of deaths on both
  sides. On this occasion, the International Commission confirmed that the sole ownership
  and proprietary right to the Western Wall belonged to the Muslims, seeing that it forms an
  integral part of the Haram el-Sharif (Sacred Sanctuary) area, which is Waqf-endowed
  property. The reckless violation of this verdict provoked the eruption of the present Aqsa
  Intifada.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The second major report was that issued by the International Commission to
  enquire into reported violations of International Law by Israel during its invasion of
  Lebanon in 1982. Its most salient recommendation was &#147;that the United Nations set up
  a special international tribunal to investigate and prosecute individuals charged with
  crimes of State, especially in connection with the [Palestinian refugee camps] Shatila and
  Sabra massacres.&#148; Once again, had the international community carried out this
  recommendation, the timing and course of the current Intifada would, perhaps, have been
  altogether different. </p>
  <u><b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Worlds apart <br>
  </b></u>Since the start of the Aqsa Intifada, two high-profile international inquiries
  were sent to the occupied territories. Mrs. Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for
  Human Rights headed the first, while former senate leader, George Mitchell, chaired the
  second. Despite the UN endorsement of both missions, the report of High Commissioner
  Robinson was treated like an unwanted orphan in official circles. As expected, there has
  been no shortage of patrons pledging to adopt the Mitchell Report. Why?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">While the Mitchell Report labours on the need to resume security
  cooperation, the Robinson report focused upon human rights abuses; it is, in fact,
  scathing in its condemnation of Israel for not showing the minimal respect for
  international humanitarian law and basic standards governing the use of force:
  &#133;&#147;the Israeli occupation forces response during the latest events suggests that
  it is official policy to shoot-to-kill or cause serious bodily injury.&#148; Therefore,
  was the dismissal of Mrs. Robinson&#146;s report the final straw that drove the former
  Irish president to declare her unwillingness to stay on for a second term at the head of
  the UNHCHR? Or, viewed from another angle, was the expulsion of the United Sates from the
  UN Human Rights Commission hastened by Washington&#146;s disregard of the High
  Commissioner&#146;s report?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The more one examines the Robinson report and compares it with the
  Mitchell Report, the more it becomes apparent why the former was shelved and the other met
  with approval. While Mrs. Robinson&#146;s report states categorically, that &#147;these
  protests are a natural result of Israel&#146;s illegal policies and measures in the
  Occupied Palestinian Territories, including occupied East Jerusalem,&#148; the Mitchell
  Report feigns apologetically: &#147;We are not a tribunal. We complied with the request
  that we do not determine the guilt or innocence of individuals or of the parties
  [involved].&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead of demanding Israeli withdrawal from all the territories illegally
  occupied since 1967 in accordance with UN resolutions, the Mitchell Report in its
  recommendations states, &#147;The IDF should consider withdrawing to positions held before
  September 28, 2000, which will reduce the number of friction points and the potential for
  violent confrontations.&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Mitchell recommendations call upon the PA to &#147;prevent gunmen from
  using Palestinian populated areas to fire upon Israeli populated areas and IDF
  positions.&#148; It makes no similar demand on the IDF to halt its &#147;excessive,
  disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force&#148; as confirmed by the Robinson
  report. Likewise, it makes no demand upon the IDF to end settler attacks. Yet the Robinson
  report says, &#147;settler violence is part of a campaign of terror against the
  Palestinian people carried out with the protection of Israel military officials&#133;.They
  are given political and logistical support by the Israeli government, and operate with the
  cooperation and backup of the Israeli Occupying Forces. Their violations against
  Palestinians range from systematically attacking Palestinian-owned properties, including
  businesses and agricultural sites, to assaulting Palestinian civilians, causing bodily
  injury or death.&#148;</p>
  <b><u><p ALIGN="LEFT">Fact or fallacy<br>
  </u></b>The Mitchell Report has naturally created strong doubts about how far its sponsors
  are prepared to go in order to stop and prevent the &#147;recurrence of violence.&#148; In
  the aftermath, some analysts maintain if the sponsors of the Mitchell Commission did not
  intend it to be a cover-up, they would not have requested the commissioners &#145;not to
  determine the guilt or innocence of individuals or of the parties.&#146;&#148; </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead of exposing the facts showing how Israel&#146;s prolonged
  belligerent occupation has perpetuated sadistic acts of cruelty and destruction of
  property and lives, the Report reduces the issue to a simplistic claim of &#147;two proud
  people&#148; who &#147;share a land and destiny.&#148; This, of course, is a gross
  distortion of the facts. The truth is one people are in occupation of another&#146;s land.
  The UN awarded the newcomer 56% of the original land. The beneficiaries thereafter seized,
  by force of arms, the remainder of the country and are now refusing to recognize the right
  of the indigenous people to 22% of their land. These are the basic facts. The fallacy
  recycled in the Mitchell Report is that the &#145;competing claims&#146; of the two proud
  peoples have led to the conflict. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Why does the Mitchell Report claim that the two people share a destiny?
  There is no partnership between the two. One people, the Palestinians, are yearning to be
  free and independent and the other, Israelis, seek to impose their will on them. With the
  help of the international community, they have wrongly and unjustly accrued to themselves
  the right to determine whether the Palestinians should have a State, what kind of State it
  should be, and who should live in it. Indeed, they insist on affecting even the most basic
  and fundamental aspects of Palestinian life. As a young student from Khan Younis refugee
  camp recently said, &#147;We lost our homes, food, drink, books, schoolbags&#151;even
  sleep we no longer taste.&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In the current climate of international relations it is hardly surprising
  that the Mitchell Report has turned out to be another fig leaf designed to cover up
  Israeli war crimes. Its integrity, impartiality and scope were always held in question
  because of its American origins. Surely if the President of the United States does not
  have the freedom to invite Yasser Arafat to the White House, how could the
  American-sponsored Mitchell Report begin to seriously criticize or rebuke Zionist Israel?
  Five months after its inauguration, the Bush Administration is still not ready to trod the
  path of conventional diplomacy. Heavily indebted as he is to America&#146;s big business
  for bankrolling his election campaign, the President&#146;s main concern now is not so
  much the wanton waste of Palestinian lives as it is to secure increased quantities of
  cheap oil from the region. Such supplies would not only keep the owners of the giant
  corporations and military industrial complex happy but it would also secure larger
  contracts for lethal weapons to crush anti-Israeli demonstrations in the Middle East.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"></i><font color="#0000FF">Defiance, dignity, and the rule of dogma</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Dr. Edward Said</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the discussion period that followed a lecture of mine at Oxford
three and a half years ago I was stunned by a question put to me by a young woman, whom I
later discovered to have been a Palestinian student working for her doctorate at the
university. I had been speaking about the events of 1948, and how it seemed to me
necessary not only to understand the connection between our history and Israel's, but that
as Arabs we needed to study that other history as one concerning us rather than avoiding
or ignoring it totally as has been the case for such a long time. The young woman's
question was to raise doubt about my views on the necessity of studying and learning about
Israel. &quot;Wouldn't that kind of attention paid to Israel,&quot; she said, &quot;be a
form of concession to it?&quot; She was asking me if ignorant
&quot;non-normalization&quot; didn't constitute a better approach to a state that had for
years made it a point of policy to stand in the way of and deny Palestinian
self-determination, to say nothing of having caused Palestinian dispossession in the first
place. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I must confess that the thought hadn't occurred to me, even during those
long years when Israel was unthinkable in the Arab world and even when one had to use
euphemisms like &quot;the Zionist entity&quot; to refer to it. After all, I found myself
asking in return, two major Arab countries had made formal peace with Israel, the PLO had
already recognized it and was pursuing a peace process with it, and several other Arab
countries had trade and commercial relations with it. Arab intellectuals had made it a
point of honor not to have any dealings with Israel, not to go there, not to meet with
Israelis, and so on and so forth, but even they had been silent when, for instance, Egypt
signed large deals selling natural gas to Israel and had maintained diplomatic relations
with the Jewish state during frequent periods of Israeli repression against the
Palestinians. How could one possibly oppose analyzing and learning everything possible
about a country whose presence in our midst for over 50 years has so influenced and shaped
the life of every man, woman and child in the Arab world? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this young woman's understanding therefore, the opposite of conceding
was supposed to be defiance, the act of defying, resisting and refusing to bend under the
will of a power that one perceives as unjust and unreasonable. That, I took it, was what
she suggested we should be practicing towards Israel and not what I was trying to propose,
which was a creative engagement with a culture and society that on all significant levels
had behaved and (as the ongoing Israeli brutality against the Aqsa Intifada shows)
continues to behave with a policy of deliberate dehumanization towards Arabs in general
and Palestinians in particular. In this the egregious Ariel Sharon is scarcely
distinguishable from Barak, Rabin and Ben-Gurion (leaving aside the truly vicious racism
of many of Sharon's allies like Scharansky, Liberman and Rabbi Ovadia Yousef). What I said
in contrast was not only a matter of understanding them but also of understanding
ourselves since our history was incomplete without consideration of Israel, what it
represented in our lives, how it had done what it had, and so forth. Besides, I continue
to believe as an educator that knowledge -- any knowledge -- is better than ignorance.
There is simply no rational justification from an intellectual point of view of having a
policy of ignorance, or using ignorance as a weapon in a struggle. Ignorance is ignorance,
no more and no less. Always and in every case. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remained puzzled, dissatisfied with my groping answer and put off by the
question which has remained with me until the present. But once again it has appeared to
challenge me unexpectedly. Let me explain. A short time ago it was revealed in the New
York press that Hilary Clinton had been compelled by federal law to return $7,000 worth of
jewelry given to her by Yasser Arafat; and, according to the same official US government
source, Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State during the second Clinton presidency, had
received $17,000 worth of jewelry from the same generous donor. Suddenly it became
possible to see the relationships between public and private attitudes in the Arab world
and to understand the connection between the young student's defiant ideas about what she
considered to be concessions to Israel on the one hand and, on the other, the Palestinian
leadership's abject and profligate generosity to American politicians who are in some
measure directly responsible for the woes heaped upon the Palestinian people. Even as I
write, American weapons of mass destruction, supplied in unlimited number to Israel, are
being used illegally -- according to US law -- to attack, kill, and maim unprotected
Palestinian men, women and children, to demolish their houses, raze their refugee camps,
make their lives basically unlivable. Yet for some years a policy of trying without reason
or dignity to woo American leaders in the most vulgar way possible has been implemented,
as if the personal pleasure and satisfaction of Hilary or Madeleine bought at the expense
of Palestinian public money were a form of policy rather than an indecent display of
bribery of a sort. The grotesque assumption has been all along that countries like America
and Israel are mirror images of Third World states in which, like Mobutu's Zaire, for
instance, policy is made according to the ruler's whim or for his family's enrichment.
What is missing here is any apprehension that these are complex, on the whole democratic,
countries whose civil societies and their interests play a large, if not decisive, role in
each country's behavior. But rather than address and try to change the mood or ideas of
their civil societies, our leaders ignore them and concentrate instead on a quick fix,
i.e. buttering up, flattering, or bribing the leader. Anyone who knows anything about
either Israel or the US will tell you that such tricks are absolutely useless; they may
gain one a dinner or a scowling handshake from the late General Rabin in the White House,
but little more than that. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The proof of what I am saying is plainly evident in the calamitous recent
history of our dealings with the US and Israel during the period since the Oslo accords
were signed. Since the Palestinian leadership betrayed its people's trust and sacrifices
by entering the Oslo process the way it did in the first place, and remaining in it as a
weak and, alas, all-too-willing partner, it has at the same time maintained a public stand
that can only be described as defiant -- a defiance, one must immediately add, that is
principally rhetorical and completely contradicted by official Palestinian behavior which
has remained (to say the least) mysteriously servile to the US and to Israel. Unsolicited
presents of expensive jewelry to American officials illustrate the point all too well.
Now, while Palestinians, armed with a few rifles and stones, are bravely defying Israel's
military the leadership is still acting like a supplicant in trying to re-open
negotiations with Israel and the US. The same things can be said about the Arab regimes
and even their intellectual sectors, who roundly proclaim their enmity towards Israel and
the US while in fact either collaborating with them politically and economically, or
loudly and clamorously denouncing normalization. The sad thing is that this contradiction
is not generally perceived as a contradiction, but as a necessary part of life today. I
would have thought that better than denouncing Israel from top to bottom it would have
been a smarter thing to cooperate with sectors inside the country who stand for civil and
human rights, who oppose the settlement policy, who are ready to take a stand on military
occupation, who believe in coexistence and equality, who are disgusted with official
repression of the Palestinians. For only in this way is there any hope of changing Israeli
policy, given the gigantic disparity in military power between all of the Arabs and
Israel. I would also have though that it is the better part of honesty to have dissociated
oneself from crude anti-Semitic attacks such as those emanating from Damascus recently:
what do these do except display to the world a mind-set that is both sectarian and
viciously stupid? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I know perfectly well that passions regarding Israeli repression of
Palestinian today are genuine and that people everywhere are disgusted with the policies
of the Sharon government. But is that passion enough of an excuse to abandon rationality
altogether, and for intellectuals, in particular, to flail around incoherently instead of
trying in a serious way to come up with a serious political and moral stand based on
knowledge rather than uninformed and blind ignorance, which cannot under any circumstances
be described as a political position? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Take the recent campaign against the translation of Arabic books into
Hebrew. One would have thought that the more Arabic literature is available in Israel, the
better able Israelis are to understand us as a people, and to stop treating us as animals
or less-than-human. Instead we have the sorry spectacle of serious Arab writers actually
denouncing their colleagues for &quot;allowing&quot; themselves to &quot;normalize&quot;
with Israel, which is the idiotic phrase used as an accusation for collaborating with the
enemy. Isn't it the case, as Julien Benda was the first to say, that intellectuals are
supposed to go against collective passions instead of trading in them demagogically? How
on earth is a Hebrew translation an act of collaboration? Getting into a foreign language
is always a victory for the writer. Always and in each case. Isn't it a far more
intelligent and useful thing than the craven &quot;normalization&quot; of the various
countries that have trade and diplomatic relationships with the enemy even as Palestinians
are being killed like so many flies by the Israeli army and air force? Aren't Hebrew
translations of Arabic literature a way of entering Israeli life culturally, making a
positive effect in it, changing people's mind from bloody passion to reasonable
understanding of Israel's Arab Others, especially when it is Israeli publishers who have
gone and published the translations as a sign of cultural protest against Israel's
barbarous Arab policy? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All these confusions and contradictions I have described are signs of a
deeper Arab malaise. When we mistake puerile acts of defiance for real resistance, and
when we assume that know-nothing ignorance is a political act (when in fact it is nothing
of the sort), and when we shed all dignity and clamor for American patronage and
attention, surely our sense of dignity and self-respect is in tatters. Who hasn't cringed
at the memory of Arafat on the White House lawn in 1993 repeating his three &quot;thank
yous&quot; with fawning abjection, and who hasn't felt that our leaders lack a sense of
self-esteem when they are unable to decide whether America is the enemy or our only hope?
Instead of a policy based on principles and norms of decent behavior we wallow instead in
futile acts of defiance based on silly, unreflective dogmas about opposition to Israel
while at the same time we only offer our besieged Palestinian compatriots lip service and
patriotic formulas. No model helps us to guide our actions. The Arab world today is the
triumph of mediocrity and opportunism, but given the leadership's failures on nearly every
front, it becomes the intellectual's role to provide honest analyses and indications of
what is reasonable and just, instead of joining the chorus of hand-clapping flatterers who
decorate the royal and presidential courts and the corporate boardrooms with their oily,
unremittingly approving presences. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I shall conclude with a concrete example of what I mean. In all the din
about normalization, I have noticed one startling absence, namely, the current status of
the Palestinian refugees living in every major Arab country, whose condition everywhere --
there are no exceptions &#150; is unacceptably miserable. Wherever there are Palestinians
in the Arab world, there are rules and regulations forbidding them full status as
residents, forbidding them work and travel, requiring them to register with the police on
a monthly basis, etc. It's not only Israel who treats Palestinians badly, it is the Arab
countries who do so also. Now see if there is a sustained campaign by Arab intellectuals
against this invidious local treatment of the Palestinian refugees: you won't see or hear
one. What excuse is there for the horrible refugee camps in which so many of them live,
even in places like Gaza and the West Bank; what right do local mokhabarat forces have to
harass and generally make their lives miserable? And why is there no protracted press
campaign to end this appalling state of affairs? Why, because it is much easier (and less
risky) to rail against normalization and Hebrew translations than it is to dramatize the
unacceptable condition of Palestinian refugees in the Arab world, who are always being
told that they cannot be &quot;normalized&quot; because it would implement Israel's
design. What rubbish! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We must return to basic values and honesty of discussion. There can be no
military solution to what ails us, Arabs and Jews alike. This truth leaves only the power
of mind and education to do the job that armies have been unable to accomplish for over
half a century. Whether Israeli intellectuals have failed or not in their mission is not
for us to decide. What concerns us is the shabby state of discourse and analysis in the
Arab world. For that, as citizens, we must take responsibility and try first of all to
release ourselves from the jejune clich�s and unthinking formulas that clutter our
writing and speaking.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Ariel Sharon must take responsibility<br>
for the violence and the deaths </font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ray Hanania*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ariel Sharon and Ariel Sharon alone shoulders the responsibility for the
current violence in the Middle East and the rising death toll that continues to take many
Arab and Jewish lives, including children and infants. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon is a student of the most fanatic of Israeli politics, a disciple of
former terrorists Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir who, prior to becoming Israeli Prime
Minister, was not beyond calling for the outright assassination of people he detested. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His shameless embrace of murder and killing as a ladder to leadership has
always set him apart from other leaders, including those who rank among the cruelest in
world history. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon&#146;s hands remain stained by the blood of thousands of civilians
and refugees in Lebanon, and he is the only Israeli Prime Minister who can say without
exaggeration that his career was built upon policies of war and confrontation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the well-crafted Israeli public relations spin, Ariel
Sharon&#146;s visit to the Haram al-Sharif was the match that lit the current Middle East
bonfire that threatens to engulf the entire world in a crisis. He did not walk onto that
compound lost in na�vet�, but as a cold, cunning political strategist who understood the
explosive nature of his act and the ramifications it would cause. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon has taken the art of State military strategy and converted it into
a form of national terrorism, targeting a civilian population of Palestinians who live
under conditions that resemble the harshest of prison environments. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He is the bully so full of his own ego and self-righteous, racist,
religious beliefs who will walk up to an innocent person and kick them to the ground and
beat them until they are a bloodied pulp. And when they try to strike back, he is the
first to hide behind the diluted assertions of anti-Semitism. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon is the first person to strike and the first to whine and cry that
the victim has inflicted pain upon those around him. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon is a leader of unprecedented cowardice, who has forced the Jewish
people into a position of unprecedented cowardice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even during the height of past conflicts, Jews around the world would at
least stand up and hold back the fanatics that dominate their Israeli political ranks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, these Jewish leaders in Europe and America remain silent, watching
in horror as innocent children and young people are murdered and butchered in a cauldron
of hate and confrontation stirred by Ariel Sharon&#146;s viciousness. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How can you not expect a people who are beaten to the ground to not stand
up and strike back in any possible way, including in such ugly anger that they would
murder innocent children? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The killers of the two Israeli teenagers may be Palestinians, but their
actions are the direct result of provocation and policies implemented by Ariel Sharon and
rubber-stamped by a weakened, and meek, Jewish community that has lost its moral voice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That the news media holds up the deaths of Israelis to a higher level of
outrage is, in and of itself, the greatest tragedy of the Ariel Sharon legacy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon knows that each time an Israeli dies a horrific death, his stature
as Israel&#146;s most qualified &#147;war consignor&#148; only improves. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The truth is that Ariel Sharon is little more than a war criminal who has
been handed a mandate to murder by a people wary of tragedy. He is the product of public
political frustration who has risen to power in much the same way that Adolph Hitler
distinguished himself as one of the world&#146;s greatest human butchers. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They both share that same megalomania that set Hitler apart on a level of
unparalleled cruelty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ariel Sharon&#146;s butcher&#146;s bill will continue to grow until people
of sanity recognize the brutality of his actions and stand up to his self-serving
political dementia. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The growing Israeli death toll may serve to portray Ariel Sharon as a
leader in times of great suffering and turmoil, but it still represents the most
reprehensible means of achieving political supremacy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon may fashion himself as the architect of a new environment, but it
is one that will some day soon not only come back to haunt those who live in the Middle
East, but will engulf the entire world in a conflict we surely should do everything to
avoid. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">What are little girls made of?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Edna Yaghi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What are little girls made of? Sugar and spice and all that&#146;s nice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Iman Hijo is the name of the little baby girl whose life was so abruptly
ended just a few weeks ago. Her death is really no big deal. Americans, for one, have much
more important concerns. For example, what brand of dog food to buy and how often should
Rover be taken for a walk. Or there might be some whales stranded on a California beach
somewhere. Or there might be that favourite TV show or chat room that becomes a priority
over the death of a single infant; especially a single Palestinian infant.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the death of this child is a human tragedy. It is the result of the
total siege of the Palestinian people and the destruction and desecration of their way of
life. Their fragile socio-economic infrastructure has been devastated and all that these
people hold dear has been sabotaged.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Baby Iman is proof that there is no escape from death in Occupied
Palestine. Her death is proof that the world watches idly and with the deepest apathy
while children and infants are slaughtered. Everyone knows that a 4-month-old child is not
a terrorist, cannot throw a stone and cannot carry a gun. Everyone knows that babies have
no hate and carry no malice. Why then did this innocent child have to die? What was the
purpose of killing her? Can Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon justify her death only on
the basis that she is Palestinian and that he covets what little land the Jews did not
confiscate and steal from its indigenous inhabitants?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What sense can there be in killing babies and toddlers? How can anyone
justify not only the death of such infants, but physically impairing a large number of
those who have so far survived the Palestinian Holocaust?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There has to be a red line that cannot be crossed. There has to be a limit
as to how much the Palestinians suffer. There is no sane reason to justify what is
happening right now in the streets, cities and villages under Israeli siege. One war
criminal cannot continue to massacre Palestinians under the guise that these dastardly
deeds that are carried out against them are for the &#147;security of Israel.&#148; What
about the security of the Palestinians? Don&#146;t they have the same rights as Israelis?
Are Palestinians occupying Israeli cities and villages? Are Palestinians attacking
Israelis by air, land and sea? Are Palestinians bombing Israeli civilians? Are
Palestinians blowing up Israeli houses by remote control and are Palestinians singling out
Israeli leaders and assassinating them?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How can Sharon pretend that Palestinians put children in harm&#146;s way
when baby Iman could not walk, could not talk and was in her mother&#146;s arms when the
house where her mother had taken her to visit relatives was shelled? At the time of the
shelling, no men were in the house. No shots were coming from the place where baby Iman
was visiting. No male member of the house belonged to any armed Palestinian resistance
group. On what grounds does Sharon justify this baby&#146;s death? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Baby Iman was not the only one who was hit. Her grandmother Samia, 38,
suffered a multitude of injuries and fractions to her abdomen, spinal cord, waist and
thigh bones. Perhaps she will never walk again, or even if she does, it will take a long
time for her to recuperate. Samia&#146;s year-and-a-half baby boy was critically injured
and so were two other children. Iman&#146;s 20-year-old mother was also seriously injured
in the shelling. The baby&#146;s father, who was not present at the time of the shelling,
had already been wounded during a separate incident a few months back. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several thousand mourners saw baby Iman to her grave in Deir al-Balah.
Those who walked the baby to her grave chanted, &#147;Long live Palestine.&#148; The baby
so far is the youngest victim of the war Israel is waging against the civilian Palestinian
population. Her father, 21-year-old Mohammed cried before the baby was taken away to be
buried, and he fainted before the body of his tiny infant daughter was lowered into her
miniature grave. Iman&#146;s mother, Suzanne, is critically injured along with the
baby&#146;s maternal grandmother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But it&#146;s no big deal as far as Israelis and Americans are concerned.
Israelis will continue to cry over their past Holocaust while in turn committing crimes as
heinous or even worse than those that were carried out against them. Americans are so busy
being gullible about whatever the American media deems fit for them to be exposed to that
they don&#146;t have the faintest idea what is gong on and they don&#146;t care. Anyway,
Americans are more worried about what their dogs eat and do than to what happens to
Palestinians half a world away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Baby Iman will never be able to experience the joy of her first steps or
watch her eager parents celebrate her first birthday. She will never go through the pains
and joys of being a teenager. She will never fall in love, will never marry, and will
never have children of her own. An infant&#146;s life was ruthlessly taken from her.
Unfortunately, she is not the exception but the rule. The war that Israelis are waging
right now is against every Palestinian man, woman and child, old and young. The strategy
of this brutal war is to either drive out or wipe out the remainder of the Palestinians
from the land that Israelis covet.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon&#146;s heart is harder than a rock. He has no mercy for non-Jews.
Even a rock can spout forth a spring, but only hate spouts forth from Sharon&#146;s
brutality. Little does he realize that one day all this hate that he directs towards
non-Jews will one day backfire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What are little girls made of? Sugar and spice and all that&#146;s nice.
This is what baby Iman was made of until her life was abruptly halted. Though to Americans
and Israelis her death is no big deal, there is one good thing that has come from her
dying for she has gone to a far, far better place than this world that is occupied by
people who did not care enough to ensure her healthy survival.</p>

on &#147;NMD&#148; (1 May 2001)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">THEY, Mr. President? Who are THEY and why do THEY hate America? Why do
THEY hate freedom and democracy? Can you tell the American people and the world just who
THEY are and what exactly are we doing that THEY should hate us? Or why we should spend
hundreds of billions of dollars in addition to our annual $325 billion defense
budget&#151;the world&#146;s largest&#151;to fight THEM? Do you think perhaps we can talk
to THEM instead of killing them? Does our support for Israel have anything to do with
their hate for us or getting us kicked out of the United Nations Human Rights Commission?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 1 May 2001, when the eyes and thoughts of the world were gripped by
anti-Globalization demonstrations that sought to protect the powerless workers from
corporate exploitation and greed, that sought to protect the environment from corporate
pollution, that sought to protect human dignity and individuality against a yellow
epidemic of McWorld&#146;s, that sought to protect the weaker, poorer southern hemisphere
of the world from the economic expansionist hegemony of the northern hemisphere&#146;s
Goliath&#151;the U.S.A.&#151;President George W. Bush delivered a 16-minute speech at the
National Defense University on America&#146;s need for a National Missile Defense (NMD)
shield that will protect America, Israel and its allies from a missile attack launched by <i><b>THEM.</b></i>
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Bush&#146;s world, there are two types of nations with
nuclear weapons: a RESPONSIBLE group that is mainly in the northern hemisphere (like the
U.S., Britain and France, all of whom are obviously civilized, wise, intelligent and
understand the responsibility of when, why and against whom nuclear weapons should be used
as was the case in Hiroshima and Nagasaki), and then there are <b>THEY</b>&#151;the
IRRESPONSIBLE group&#151;the group that HATE America, its friends, democracy, liberty and
freedom. Although the President did not specifically mention the names of
&#147;THEY&#148;, one can easily infer from his reference to Saddam Hussein that these
IRRESPONSIBLE nations are the non-white, non-Christian, southern hemisphere poor,
starving, sanctioned, bombed rogue States that according to Bush are a threat to Western
civilization and of course to America&#146;s heartland&#151;Israel. As Bush said,
&#147;Most troubling of all, the list of these countries includes some of the world&#146;s
least-responsible States. Unlike the Cold War, today&#146;s most urgent threat&#133;comes
from a small number of missiles in the hands of these States&#151;States for whom terror
and blackmail are a way of life. They seek weapons of mass destruction to intimidate their
neighbours and to keep the United States and other <i>responsible nations</i> from helping
allies and friends in strategic parts of the world. Like Saddam Hussein, some of
today&#146;s tyrants are gripped by an implacable hatred of the United States of America.
In such a world, Cold War deterrence is no longer enough to maintain peace, to protect our
own citizens and our own allies and friends.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush&#146;s speech is vintage Conservative, Right-Wing Republican
ideologue, pro-Military-Industrial Complex foreign policy of good versus evil. A policy
whose mistaken claim to fame is the defeat of Communism and one desperately in search for
a new enemy, a new &#147;ism&#148;, that rationalizes a Cold War view of the world while
providing enormous wealth to the cadre of politicians, lobbyists, CEO&#146;s and a dozen
or so weapon-producing companies whose sale of weapons of death ensures a life of luxury.
Former President Eisenhower&#146;s warning about the influence and power of the
military-industrial complex has fallen on deaf, greedy American ears shameless in their
pursuit of &#147;happiness&#148; at the expense of the world&#146;s misery.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was left up to the State Department to elucidate who the THEY are. As
expected, THEY are the familiar nursery rhyme nations called ROGUE STATES: Iran, Iraq,
Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba. These are the nations that are forcing the most
powerful nation on earth with 7,295 nuclear warheads to embark out of pure greed and
manufactured fear to build the most expensive, unproven and twice-failed national missile
defense shield at a cost upward of $250 billion to $300 billion dollars. Never mind that
not one of these seven nations has a single proven nuclear warhead. Never mind that the
combined military budget of these seven nations is $16 billion compared to America&#146;s
$325 billion. Still Bush&#146;s logic is that our superpower military plus our
&#147;friend&#146; Israel&#146;s estimated 200-300 nuclear warheads plus NATO&#146;s
nuclear capabilities are no match for these SEVEN DWARFS. To Bush&#146;s thinking, the
more nuclear bombs you have the less secure you are against attack from irrational,
hungry, crazy third-world regimes. Sounds like a rehash of Israel&#146;s logic where a
Palestinian stone threatens to annihilate nuclear Israel. Never mind that any nation
firing any missile against America or Israel will be annihilated. I guess its true that
internal peace and security does not come by accumulating bombs but rather in accumulating
friends.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush&#146;s Cold War rhetoric has already upset the delicate North and
South Korea dialogue; squandered any China-Taiwan peace initiative; and boldly and blindly
swallowed Israel&#146;s line on murdering Palestinians, building settlements, demolishing
homes and farms, and encircling towns with nightly bombing raids as being important for
Israel&#146;s &#147;defense and security,&#148; effectively abrogating the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile act with Russia that has effectively worked in reducing nuclear
warheads, raised fears in Europe about NATO&#146;s future and America&#146;s newfound
independence on national security issues, including the withdrawal of American troops from
the Sinai and perhaps the Balkans. The only people salivating at the prospect of hundreds
of billions of dollars lining their pocket are the Cold War remnants ruling Washington and
Corporate America (like Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Raytheon and TRW). Donald Rumsfeld,
Secretary of Defense, has in effect emerged as Bush&#146;s Cold War soul mate to the
embarrassment of Colin Powell, the lackluster general whose dimming star will ensure his
abrupt departure from an administration bent on confrontation in a world thriving on
interdependence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush said that these rogue States would blackmail the world should they
possess nuclear weapons. Perhaps given his alcoholic youth he may have forgotten that it
was Yitzhak Rabin in 1973 who blackmailed Richard Nixon to airlift billions of dollars of
weapons to Israel during the Yom Kippur War otherwise he would use nuclear weapons. Israel
is the only country in the Middle East with nuclear capabilities and the only one that has
NOT signed the Non-Nuclear Proliferation Treaty while Iraq and Iran have. Israel is not
only the fourth largest recipient of American arms but has become (thanks to the American
taxpayer) the world&#146;s fifth largest weapon exporter, often breaking American Arms
Export laws by selling American technology to third world countries. In fact, Israel is
the most condemned nation on earth by virtually all human rights organizations including
the American State Department. It is the only nation without recognized borders or a
recognized capital. But America loves it because they both share the common value of
&#147;kicking butt.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&gt;From 1993 to 1997, the U.S. government sold and approved $190 billion
in weapons to virtually every nation on earth making it the largest seller of military
weapons in the world. In fact, the U.S. accounts for 70% of all world military sales
annually. The powerful arms industry is one of the largest political donors in the country
giving nearly $2 million in the 1998 election to the Democratic Party to ensure this
peddling of death, often to poor countries. The American military industry and government
have no qualms about selling weapons to both sides of a conflict or to dictators and human
rights abusers. A dollar is a dollar, who cares who dies for it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tragically, the Middle East is the largest consumer of American weapons.
Many of the poor Arab countries spend up to three times their budget on the military than
on health and education combined. It&#146;s hard to understand the logic of so much
weaponry when no Arab nation aspires to fight Israel and when so many people are hungry,
illiterate and without basic health care.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s only logical to assume that the world&#146;s richest, most
powerful nation would have a sound, well-thought-out, scientifically based, economically
feasible, and politically stable military policy to promote not only its own security and
national interests but one that would promote world peace, security and human
preservation. After decades of the world living in fear of total annihilation under the
aptly named Cold War policy &#147;MAD&#148; (Mutually Assured Destruction), where the U.S.
alone spent $5 trillion to wage a cold war, President Bush is committing America to
hundreds of billions of dollars to a system that at its core implies a Xenophobic,
isolationist, cowardly, with an understated Israeli-motivated anti-Islamic crusade (five
of the seven rogue States are Islamic). One can dub Bush&#146;s crusade-like shield as the
National &#147;Muslim&#148; Defense Shield.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America&#146;s greatness does not lie in the logic of its power but in the
power of its logic. A nation&#146;s strength is not measured in bombs but in the ideals
and principles it espouses, its character and high moral ground, its humility and
humanity, and its willingness to serve as well as lead. A civilized nation manifests civil
not aggressive behaviour. Bush&#146;s irrational exuberance and inexperience may be at
fault but he needs to heed the wisdom of warriors for peace and justice not for blood. The
world barely survived a Cold War; must our future be hostage to &#147;fear&#148;? If, as
Bush said, Christ is his philosopher and owns his heart, then his actions are more worthy
of the Anti-Christ.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Why do Palestinian children <br>
grow up to be suicide bombers?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud* </i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday, 20 May, Israeli troops raided a workplace located near a border
area, known as Beit Shaimish, which separates the West Bank and Israel. They rounded up
Palestinian workers who were accused of entering Israel to work without permits. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Wikalat news agency, the workers were transported to an
unknown destination and were severely beaten by the laughing and jeering troops. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Three of the Palestinian labourers, who apparently challenged the siege to
secure money for their families, are currently in a Palestinian hospital in the town of
Beit Jala suffering from serious wounds. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two of those who were seriously wounded&#151;Khadir Berah 26, and Yahya
Berah 25&#151;were brothers from the village of al-Khadr, while the rest of the workers
came from the area of Bethlehem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The wounded labourers narrated the events to the Palestinian news agency
WAFA, saying that after receiving heavy and unexplained beatings and insults and while
some of those seriously hurt were bleeding and barely able to move, amused Israeli
soldiers decided to prolong the tragic episode. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Adding insult to injury, Palestinian labourers were forced to mimic animal
voices; a few were forced to walk fast on their hands and knees, and others were ordered
to run back and forth as Israeli soldiers jeered and laughed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The story is tragic and depressing, but a common one. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in late September, nearly
one third of the Palestinian population was left without any means of making an income.
Most of those who still had jobs lost a substantial amount of their monthly earnings
while, according to a recent survey conducted by the Palestinian Bir Zeit University,
almost all of the population were in one way or the other hurt financially. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besieged Palestinian workers were left without an income while some
helplessly watched their impoverished families&#146; condition worsen; others chose the
risky path of entering Israel in search of jobs without permits. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Bethlehem workers who endured unforgettable humiliation were most
likely some of those who chose this risky path to maintain a living. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But more tragic is the significance behind the date on which these workers
were beaten and abused: Sunday, May 20. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Exactly 11 years ago, on Sunday, 20 May 1990, a group of Palestinian
labourers were lined up by an Israeli solider as they waited for transportation back to
Gaza. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The terrified labourers who gathered in an area of southern Israel known
as Rishon Lezion (known to Palestinians by its Arabic name Oyon Qara) handed their ID
cards to the Israeli soldier. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The solider ordered the distressed labourers to kneel down and face the
ground and unexpectedly showered them with a barrage of bullets, killing seven and
wounding many. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Back in the West Bank and Gaza, grieving Palestinians took to the streets
and cried in vain, denouncing Israel&#146;s latest massacre. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In between the massacre of 1990 and the incident of 2001, many massacres
have been committed; the perpetrators are typically hailed by Israelis as heroes, yet the
pain of the victim was never acknowledged. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And now, as Israel has upgraded its military strategy to the use of F-16
warplanes against Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps, the Beit Shaimish
experience is perceived as news of little interest, hardly even mentioned by the Western
media. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But for those dignified men who were forced to mimic animal voices while
suffering from broken ribs and bleeding jaws, the incident can never be forgotten nor can
the pain be eased. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the massacre of Rishon Lezion of 1990, which is now remembered
as Black Sunday, many other Palestinian workers have been gruesomely killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And following the Black Sunday massacre, 12 other Palestinians were shot
dead and nearly 1,200 wounded in the days that followed as they rushed to the streets
displaying anger and grief. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The never forgetful Palestinians also remember the burning of three
Palestinian labourers while they slept in a tent in Israel during the 1987 uprising. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Working in Israel nowadays is similar to walking through a field of land
mines. But when children&#146;s lives are on the line, desperate Palestinian workers are
willing to take such risks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every one of those who was killed left behind children who will grow and
become the strong and determined men and women leading the ongoing Palestinian uprising. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And it is likely that the recent victims of Beit Shaimish also have their
own children who must comprehend the depth of their tragedy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those, too, will likely take to the streets, attempting to convey their
rage by chanting angry words and throwing rocks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Others who might feel that rock-throwing is not enough to restore the
dignity of a dying father who was forced to walk and talk like an animal might choose a
more extreme path to avenge that stolen dignity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The world today stands mainly apathetic to the fate of Palestinians who
are enduring Israel&#146;s war crimes almost every day. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And yet the same indifferent world today is likely to rise up tomorrow and
ask in animosity and anger, &#147;Why do Palestinian children grow up to be suicide
bombers?&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"></i><font color="#0000FF">Putting an end to the violence</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Shahida Moosa</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was a rainy, headline-news-making reception: Yasser Arafat had arrived
in Pretoria. The Palestinian delegation met with the Non-Aligned Movement, currently
chaired in South Africa. A special Committee for Palestine had been set up, and the agenda
included the joint Jordanian-Egyptian peace plan proposal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many things struck me as ironic: Arafat came all this way just to announce
at a press conference that he &#147;would not walk away from peace negotiations!&#148; and
that he had accepted the Jordanian-Egyptian proposal. (The drowning man clutching at those
proverbial straws?) Lip service, rhetoric and &#147;moral&#148; support all followed
suit&#133;we were back to square one, I thought.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I wondered what was the use of setting up &#147;special&#148; committees
when all the participants did was discuss, talk and meet, and in the end would issue the
usual lousy statement of condemnation (<i>d�j� vu</i> from all previous
meetings)&#133;paper, words, little else! How much more meaningful would it have been if
they had emerged from the talks with something tangible? Like all 16 countries in the NAM
severing ties with Israel, or at least instituting some sort of boycott or sanctions? How
did the statement they actually issued help prevent even one child from dying, one tree
from being destroyed, one Israeli rocket from being fired? They recognized that what
Israel is doing is unforgivably criminal&#133;but I guess it is good enough to say
&#147;bad, bad Israel, they shouldn&#146;t be doing this, naughty, naughty!&#148; After
all, who wants to risk being punished by Israel&#146;s powerful big-bully brother, the
United States?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">South Africa of all places should know what Palestine is suffering!
Mandela, Mbeki and all the others know that mere statements, mere words, were not enough
to destroy Apartheid! How can they expect it to destroy an even worse oppression? Yet all
anyone ever sees are their smiles and hugs for Arafat, &#147;pledging&#148; their support
for the Palestinian people. What does that translate into? Certainly not any real help for
the Palestinians&#133;as they said in the movie: &#147;SHOW ME THE MONEY!!&#148;&#133;We
are still waiting&#133;Not for money, necessarily (although that would help, too), but for
some concrete, some tangible HELP!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How ironic was it that the &#147;peace proposal&#148; came from Jordan and
Egypt? The two countries that really could help Palestine, being her closest and strongest
neighbours, propose a deal to serve their masters instead of their brothers. Everyone who
is anyone knows that these two countries are just out for personal gain, financial
security and their relations with Palestine&#146;s biggest enemies! Has Arafat not yet
learned that Palestine has 3 enemies: the enemy himself, the enemy of Palestine&#146;s
friend, and the FRIEND OF PALESTINE&#146;S ENEMY! (Maybe it is difficult for him to
recognize, because he is one of the &#147;Big 3&#148;?) He has the uncanny and amazing
ability to leave me speechless as he sinks unceremoniously to new all-time lows.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So what&#146;s next? Kill and imprison the brave freedom-fighters?
&#147;End&#148; the intifada? Return to the &#147;negotiating&#148; table, with less than
nothing to &#147;negotiate&#148; with? Another Oslo perhaps? Sharon has already laid a
firm foundation for the way forward in their terms: NO &#147;negotiations&#148; under
&#147;fire&#148;! NO Jerusalem! NO Right of Return! NO demolishing of settlements! (on the
contrary, expansion and the establishment of more settlements!)&#133;giving those who
have, MORE, and leaving us once again with even tinier, unsustainable Bantustans, no
intifada, no freedom, no justice&#133;not even the golden platter upon which our
&#147;leaders&#148; handed our rights, our land and our dignity over to them without a
fight!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Peres was in the United States, drumming up support for Israel.
I always find those trips so unnecessary! What more could the U.S. possibly do for Israel?
Other countries should learn the true meaning of friendship, loyalty and support from the
treatment of Israel by the U.S.! They certainly know how to &#147;show Israel the
money&#148;, politically, financially and militarily, not just morally and verbally alone!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two meetings on the opposite sides of the Atlantic (and the Equator,
too, mind you) had one thing in common: the phrase &#147;putting an end to the
violence&#148;. Whose violence? Everything seemed focused on stopping the intifada instead
of putting a stop to the Israeli tanks, gunships, shells and soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, I wondered, if this were a contest: NAM and Palestine versus the U.S.
and Israel, who do you think would win? One hand, one veto, and all our efforts would be
brought to nothing&#133;again!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We cannot rely on corrupt leaders or on the enemies and their friends to
help us; we can only rely on ourselves! Islam teaches us that all Believers are a single
Brotherhood. How about realizing this Brotherhood, and start by &#147;SHOWING THE
PALESTINIANS THE MONEY!&#148; in every way we are able to.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The old Chinese proverb says that the journey of a thousand miles starts
with a single step! Let us take this single step together, now! This is not only our
responsibility, but it is our sacred duty. A duty we will be answerable for to Allah one
day! Let us strive in the Cause of Truth and Justice now, so that when we meet our
Creator, we will not have our heads hung in shame! Come on Muslims: WAKE UP! Help
Palestine, her people, and Masjid al-Aqsa before it is too late! With Allah&#146;s help
(and not the so-called &#147;help&#148; of our corrupt leaders) and through unity and
collective effort, we will achieve VICTORY! Ameen.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"></i><font color="#0000FF">The makings of a suicide bomber</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Ruth Anderson</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The only way to stop the suicide bombings is to halt the campaign of
injustice against the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine. Whenever any occupier uses
force, brutality and disregard for the sanctity of life, then such tactics will backfire
against those responsible for suppressing the people. The backlash of this oppression has
struck the heart of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent spate of suicide bombings within Israel would very likely not
have occurred if the Israeli government did not pursue a policy of indiscriminate killings
of Palestinian civilians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No one can say that two wrongs make a right. But those who care to judge
the suicide bombers are not under siege, do not have their cities cut off from each other,
are not attacked by helicopters, armoured tanks, ships at sea, and ground to ground
missiles. From a safe distance where terror does not break out in the middle of the night
or at any moment during the day, it is easy to condemn those who blow themselves to
pieces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What makes a suicide bomber? A few days ago, during a funeral procession
in the Occupied Territories, Israeli forces shot at mourners who were walking to bury
their dead. A twelve-year-old boy was hit and killed and at least 11 others were injured.
The participants of the funeral procession were not demonstrating and were not throwing
stones, but were rather minding their own sorrowful business when they came under attack.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is unfortunate that Israeli civilians become the victims of the people
their government is trying to exterminate. But it must be expected that no people will
continue to be subjected to inhuman treatment without fighting back. History is our best
teacher, and throughout the course of human life on earth, man has always fought back
against the injustice of his fellow man.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">William Wallace died for the principals he believed in and to free the
Scots from the suppression and cruelty of the British. His courage became a symbol that
led the Scottish people to fight for their freedom at a time when they had been robbed of
their inalienable rights as human beings. No one remembers Wallace as a terrorist. No one
blames the Scots for fighting for their freedom.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Early Americans fought for their freedom and independence from the British
Colonists. No one called George Washington a terrorist. Today, Americans revere the brave
people who fought and died on American battlefields so that all Americans could have
liberty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Later, the American Indians rose up against the barbaric oppression of the
American settlers. Nearly 90% of the Indian population was wiped out by either massacres
or the diseases that the settlers spread. It was only when it was too late that the
remnants of Indian tribes united in one last brave battle so that they could remain on the
land that they loved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Prime Minister Sharon knows that he can get away with the murder
of the Palestinian people. He knows that he can cut off their cities, their villages, that
he can dig medieval trenches to separate Palestinians from one another and from the world
at large. He knows that he can destroy their farmland, uproot their trees and bulldoze
their homes while the world watches uncaringly. He knows that his soldiers can shoot
little Palestinian children on the way home from school, and he knows that when an infant
throws a stone at a heavily armed soldier, the retaliation will be either the death of the
stone thrower or his permanent injury.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He knows that he can send Israeli mortars into the offices and
headquarters of the Palestinian Authority and that he can assassinate any Palestinian he
wishes to without a reason. He knows he can get away with murder because he does not fear
impotent Arab leaders and because America turns a blind eye to whatever atrocities he
commits.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reasons he gives for his &#147;excessive use of force&#148;, for his
crimes against humanity, for the cruel suppression of the Palestinians is that he is
quelling the violence when he knows very well that this is not it at all. He is using the
intifada as an excuse to cut up Palestinian enclaves and make them more and more like Nazi
concentration camps and ghettos. He is the master exterminator. He pretends to be killing
off Palestinians for the security of Israel when, in fact, he is the one who, by his
brutal practices, has endangered Israeli citizens more than ever before.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Violence begets violence. War begins in the minds of men so it is here
that peace must also begin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There will always be suicide bombers as long as Palestinians are so
cruelly treated and ruthlessly butchered. There will always be suicide bombers as long as
there is no justice and as long as the Palestinians become more and more impoverished and
have less and less hope for their future. The Holocaust is no longer Jewish, it is
Palestinian. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here you have the makings of a suicide bomber. And remember, every
Palestinian under the occupation has no hope for tomorrow and every Palestinian has become
a potential suicide bomber.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><i>Samah Jabr*</i></strong></p>

<p align="left"><i>[This is the] iron law of every colonizing movement, a law which knows
of no exceptions, a law which existed in all times and under all circumstances.&nbsp; If
you wish to colonize a land in which people are already living, you must provide a

without an armed force which will render physically impossible any attempts to destroy or

IMPOSSIBLE!&nbsp; Zionism is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls by
the question of armed force.&nbsp; It is important to build, it is important to be able to
shoot&#151;or else I am through with playing at colonialization.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>Vladimir Jabotinsky, The Iron Law, Selected Writings</i></p>

<p align="left"><i><br>
</i>There is no one left to tell the story but the few blankets the policemen used to
overcome the cold nights, an old kettle and a few broken glasses from which the men drank
their tea.&nbsp; They left behind some dips that they were having for dinner and scarlet
pita bread still immersed in blood and tracks where their bodies were dragged and dumped
into a ditch. <br>
<br>
This is what the Israelis left for us at the Palestinian police station in Bitunia, a
suburb of Ramallah.&nbsp; &#147;There was suspicious activity going on at that security
point and we had to fire at them for security reasons.&#148; This is their explanation to
the world for their actions. And just like the famous book describing Rwanda&#146;s
grizzly genocide, <i>Leave None to Tell the Story</i>, Israeli forces have committed
murder so that only silence spells out the reality.&nbsp; If Israelis can murder the best
among us, perhaps those left behind will finish the job for them in chaotic actions of the
grieved and furious.&nbsp; I can hear the Israeli military thinking, &#147;Those animal
Palestinians, let them kill each other.&nbsp; We&#146;ll torment them until they lash out
at whoever passes by, even their own.&#148; <br>
<br>
There is no honour in this war of &#147;winner-take-all.&#148;&nbsp; I wonder, is this
kind of killing based on the rationales of sheer imperialism?&nbsp; Does this mean that
Israel will start with us and act out the metaphor of their national flag with its two
blue stripes and the Star of David in the middle&#151;a Zionist State that stretches from
the Nile to the Tigris/Euphrates?&nbsp; Is it in American interests for them to do this?<br>
<br>
The newly published &#147;Mitchell Report&#148; suggests, and evidently that&#146;s all it
can do, that one of the most important solutions for the massive ethnic cleansing
occurring in our land is that Israeli and Palestinian security forces &#147;resume
security cooperation.&#148;&nbsp; Israel&#146;s answer to that &#147;suggestion&#148; is
to murder five Palestinian policemen at a remote security point where no violence has ever
taken place throughout this whole inflamed episode.&nbsp; Such an act of war is the result
of Revisionist Zionist Vladimir Jabotinsky&#146;s gift to the Zionist movement, for it was
he who taught Begin, Shamir and others right up to Sharon what it costs to destroy other
people.&nbsp; Evidently, the price is not too high for Israel.&nbsp; I wonder, is this
price too high for America and the international community it heads?<br>
<br>
The dead policemen, who served in Bitunia for the last two years, have been sent home to
Gaza from whence they came.&nbsp; They did not realize their dreams:&nbsp; to see their
families again.&nbsp; To Americans, Gaza is another place, another land.&nbsp; How many
know that it is only a couple of hours&#146; drive from Bitunia.&nbsp; And, yet, these
men, once stationed as protective guards at a Palestinian security point that separates
the Palestinian-controlled area A from the Israeli-controlled area C in Bitunia, could not
go home to see their parents, wives and children.&nbsp; Distance was not the question;
only Israeli security mattered.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
What about Palestinian security?&nbsp; The Palestinian Authority made a plea to the United
Nations Security Council to provide an international protection &#147;force&#148; for
Palestinians.&nbsp; &#147;No,&#148; said the government of Israel, &#147;such a force
would prove unresponsive to Israeli security concerns.&#148;&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Is
it because even nations that violate human rights among their own people can see the
discrepancies in the war the Israelis provoke?&nbsp; Is that why places like genocidal
Sudan remain on the UN Human Rights Commission, but the United States, the nation that
supports Israel&#146;s defense, does not?&nbsp; Has the rest of the world awakened to the
wrong of this war just as they did to Viet Nam?<br>
<br>
Most people do not know about Revisionist Zionism which is political and has nothing
whatsoever to do with Judaism.&nbsp; Most have not heard about men such as Vladimir
Jabotinsky, a racist traitor who betrayed his own Jewish countrymen on several occasions,
a man who guided former head of the Irgun Terrorists and later Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin.&nbsp; I have read that the first thing Menachem Begin did when he became
Prime Minister of Israel was to hang a picture of Jabotinsky in his office.
&nbsp; Jabotinsky was not a freedom fighter.&nbsp; Ask Jewish historian and journalist
Lenni Brenner about Jabotinsky.&nbsp; He writes in his famous book, <i>The Iron Wall</i>&#151;<i>Zionist
Revisionism from Jabotinsky to Shamir</i>, that Jabotinsky writings render him a blatant
racist and old-fashioned imperialist, a man whose writings make his views no more than
&#147;museum curios.&#148; <br>
<br>
Many Americans say that they must stand by their noble friend, Israel.&nbsp; One member of
Congress wrote to an American friend of mine who had pled with him not to fail the
Palestinians, &#147;Israel is one of our most loyal allies in their region of the world.
&nbsp; I believe it is in our nation&#146;s best interest to remain committed to our
special relationship with them.&#148;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
He goes on, &#147;However, I share and understand your concern regarding all the fighting
taking place in this region.&nbsp; I remain hopeful that a diplomatic solution for peace
can be reached in a timely fashion.&#148;&nbsp; Obviously, this Congressman has not read
the words of Jabotinsky or Begin or Shamir right on up to Ariel Sharon.&nbsp; Peace
without justice is not a reality in our modern world no matter how strong the rhetoric of
hope. <br>
<br>
My friend wrote to his Congressman, &#147;What does Israel do for America?&#148;
&nbsp; Let&#146;s see, it offers an excuse for the friends of Israel to finance political
careers in America, something that goes against the grain of democratic values for most
Americans.&nbsp; It creates dissent between friends of Israel and other Americans who
favour justice and an end to racism, even in colonized nations.&nbsp;&nbsp; It violates
international laws including the mandates set forth at the end of the Holocaust in Germany
that Americans fought to end.&nbsp; Where is the understanding of the Nuremberg Commission
which left us thinking &#147;never again, never again such evil crimes against
humanity?&#148;<br>
<br>
Beyond morally unjust provocation, what does this war in Palestine/Israel do for America?
&nbsp; First, it threatens America&#146;s oil supply.&nbsp; My friend wrote that he paid
$30 for a tank of gas, the most he&#146;s paid since the Gulf war days.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It alienates people from developing countries all the way from the Atlantic to the
Tigris/Euphrates and on over the hills into India and Pakistan, not just between the Nile
and the Tigris/Euphrates.&nbsp; It displays none of the ethical values taught to us
through our Judeo-Christian-Muslim religious traditions.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If Israel is America&#146;s &#147;loyal ally,&#148; why does the Israeli government focus
entirely on stirring up the world&#146;s anger?&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that Israel and
America are putting into action a Machiavellian &#147;Zionist&#148; Jabotinsky method to
achieve goals which may lead to worldwide violence, the likes of which are not in any way
party to America&#146;s interests. <br>
<br>
We speak on and on about peace talks, commissions, coming to the table, stopping the
violence.&nbsp; Yet, America continues to send billions of dollars to help finance
Israel&#146;s violent aggression and vetoes UN resolutions to send international forces to
protect the Palestinians. I believe that until aggression really does stop, there will be
no peace.&nbsp; Another Palestinian medical student colleague of mine wrote, &#147;Until
Israeli aggression stops, we may have truces, but never peace.&#148;&nbsp; Jabotinsky, for
all his disposition of not caring whom he harms, is right: &#147;A voluntary agreement is
just not possible.&#148; He wrote in recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people,
&#147;As long as the [Palestinians] preserve a gleam of hope that they will succeed in
getting rid of us, nothing in the world can cause them to relinquish this hope, precisely
because they are not a rabble, but a living people.&#148; And living people will be ready
to yield on such fateful issues only when they have given up all hope of getting rid of
alien settlers.<br>
<br>
As long as Israel allows troops to murder their military counterparts without genuine
provocation, to pass off the death of Palestinian babies like four-month-old Iman Hajjo as
death-deserved or to permit crimes against humanity such as ignoring criminal acts of
Israeli settlers&#151;the latest of which was a horror in which Israeli soldiers in
al-Mawasi/Gaza held back the frantic Palestinian parents of a now dead teenager, Kifah
Zourob, while the settlers released their wild dogs to attack him and maul him to
death&#151;there will be no peace in Palestine as long as this behaviour is the norm of
the day.<br>
<br>
Atrocities are a part of war.&nbsp; They are also evil.&nbsp; Will we Palestinians
surrender when we have no hope?&nbsp; Perhaps, but not in our memories. In our memory, our
anger will remain, pent up for generations.&nbsp; Is it anti-Jewish to speak out about
oppression and violence done in the name of colonization?&nbsp; I consider my position to
be pro-Jewish for surely no genuinely religious Jewish person would support such wrong.
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I ask this question, &#147;Does doing good of one nation justify evil done against
another?&#148;&nbsp; Think about that in the days ahead.&nbsp; <br>

  <p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Real Significance of Baruch Goldstein</font></b></p>
  <p>The story of the massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein in the Patriarchs' Cave in
  Hebron on February 25, 1994, is well known. Goldstein entered the Muslim prayer hall and
  shot worshippers mostly in their backs, killing 29, including children, and wounding many
  more. In this chapter we shall not describe that massacre; rather we shall focus upon
  Goldstein's career prior to the massacre and upon the reactions of the Israeli government
  and fundamentalist Jews to the massacre a short time after it occurred. This should
  provide a vivid illustration of Jewish fundamentalism. We shall extend our discussion of
  some details until the summer of 1998. <br>
  One important background fact about Goldstein exemplifies the influence of Jewish
  fundamentalism in Israel: long before the massacre, Goldstein as an army physician
  repeatedly breached army discipline by refusing to treat Arabs, even those serving in the
  Israeli army. He was not punished, either while in active or reserve service, for his
  refusal because of intervention in his favor. Political commentators discussed this story
  in the Hebrew press even though not a single Israeli politician referred to it. This story
  deserves detailed exploration in our analysis of Jewish fundamentalism.<br>
  In his March 1, 1994, Yediot Ahronot article, Arych Kizel, a regular Davar correspondent,
  wrote that Goldstein, shortly after immigrating to Israel and as a conscript assigned to
  an artillery <br>
  battalion in Lebanon as a doctor, refused to treat Gentiles. According to Kizel,
  Goldstein, after refusing to treat a wounded Arab, declared: &quot;I am not willing to
  treat any non-Jew. I recognize as legitimate only two [religious] authorities: Maimonides
  and Kahane.&quot; Kizel further reported: Three Druze soldiers who served in Goldstein's
  battalion approached their commander and asked for another doctor to be stationed in their
  battalion, because they were afraid that Goldstein would refuse to treat them in case they
  were wounded. Because of their request Goldstein was <br>
  reassigned to another battalion. He continued to serve as a military doctor both in the
  &nbsp; conscript army and in the reserves. After some years he was reassigned to the
  regional Hebron brigade of the central command where he thereafter served his reserve
  stint. Immediately after receiving this assignment, he told his commanders that his
  religious faith would make it impossible for him to treat wounded or ill Arabs; he asked
  to be reassigned elsewhere. His request was granted, and he was reassigned to a reserve
  unit serving in South Lebanon. <br>
  Amir Oren, who subsequently became the military correspondent of&nbsp; Haaretz, provided
  the most complete story of Goldstein's relations with the Israeli army and the entire
  Israeli political establishment in his March 4 Davar article. According to Oren, after the
  1984 elections and <br>
  the subsequent formation of the national unity government, then Defense Minister Yitzhak
  Rabin and then Chief of Staff General Moshe Levy learned about Goldstein's refusal to
  treat non-Jews in Lebanon. Oren wrote: <br>
  When Goldstein's refusal to treat non-Jewish patients became evident to his commanders,
  both the artillery corps and medical corps commanders quite naturally wanted to
  court-martial him and thus get rid of him. They took it for granted that this could be
  easily done, because Goldstein <br>
  had graduated only from the army's course for medical officers. [Goldstein did not have
  combat officer training, which is normally a prerequisite for admission to the course for
  medical officers.] The two corps [commanders] also knew that Goldstein, while attending
  the army's course for medical officers, had become notorious as an anti-Arab extremist. <br>
  According to other Hebrew press reports, some of Goldstein's trainee colleagues demanded
  that he be dismissed from the course; their demand was refused. Oren related:
  &quot;[Goldstein] was already then protected by highly placed people in senior ministries.
  'Mose patrons requested that <br>
  Goldstein be allowed to serve in Kryat Arba rather than in a combat battalion.&quot; 'Me
  situation then developed into &quot;a bone of contention between the commander of the
  army's medical corps and its chief rabbi.&quot; Oren continued: <br>
  In the end the issue of what to do with an officer who openly refused to obey orders by
  invoking Halacha has never been resolved, even if that officer openly refused to provide
  medical help both to Israeli soldiers and POWs. Can we avoid being stunned by the army's
  failure to court-martial Goldstein? Why was no order to court-martial him ever issued by
  the entire chain, of the army command? That chain of command included the commander of the
  northern command, Reserve General Orri Or [a labor MK and later in 1994 the chairman of
  the Knesset Committee for Foreign and Defense Affairs], and General Amos Yaron, who now is
  the commander of the manpower department. Why did they refuse to decide without first
  consulting the chief rabbi? The already embarrassed medical corps [commanders] now [after
  the massacre] admit that they were scared by publicity that might have propelled the
  religious parties and religious settlers' lobbies to make things more of a mess than ever
  before. The fear of publicity time after time prompted the army commanders to give in to
  all kinds of Goldsteins, rather than to denounce their views and court-martial them. <br>
  Many sources corroborated Oren's hinting that this Goldstein situation did not constitute
  a unique case. The story told by Oren revealed the pervasiveness of the religious parties'
  influence in the Israeli army. Jewish orthodoxy's stance against non-Jews, as openly
  advocated by Goldstein's idolized leader, Rabbi Meir Kahane, was - and still is - an
  essential position held by the major religious parties. As such, this stance has had a
  strong impact upon the Israeli army. Had Rabin and the army commanders mentioned by Oren,
  moreover, felt no affinity whatsoever with Kahane's and Goldstein's views, they would not
  have given in to the religious parties with <br>
  such abandon and thus sacrificed all consideration of military discipline. Israeli
  policies, directed towards Palestinians, other Middle East Arabs (perceived by Zionists as
  non-Jews) and people of other nations, are only explainable by assuming that they are
  based upon anti-Gentile feeling. The anti-Gentile feeling is strongest among the most
  religious Jews but exists as well in this secular milieu. This is the reason why support
  for Goldstein in 1984 and 1985 had a sequel in the excuses by many Israeli leaders for the
  slaughter. These excuses were thinly disguised by mostly hypocritical expressions of
  shock. <br>
  Goldstein's refusal to give proper medical treatment to non-Jews continued after he was
  transferred to Kiryat Arba. In his February 27,1994 Yediot Ahronot article, Nahum Bamea
  wrote: <br>
  The senior Israeli ar3ny officer in the Hebron area told me about his two encounters with
  Baruch Goldstein. The second time he saw him was in the company of Kach goons who were
  abusing President Ezer Weisman during his visit to Kiryat Arba. The first time he
  encountered Goldstein was after an Israeli soldier had wounded a local Arab in his legs.
  The Arab was brought to an army clinic for treatment, but Goldstein refused to treat him.
  Another army physician had to be summoned to substitute for Goldstein. The officer did not
  explain why Goldstein was thereafter not demoted in rank but was rather allowed to keep
  performing his duties in the reserves. Incidentally, his misconduct also constituted a
  violation of the oath he had taken upon becoming a doctor, but for this the Israeli army
  cannot be blamed. <br>
  Barnea made clear that the entire Israeli establishment, not just the army, was
  responsible for the leniency granted to Goldstein for his misdeeds. 'Me leniency lasted
  until the massacre. Only after the massacre did the official line change to shock, coupled
  with assertions that Goldstein had acted alone. Thus, during the first three hours after
  the slaughter Rabin and his retinue insisted either that Goldstein was a psychopath or
  that he was a devoted doctor who happened to suffer a momentary derangement. Barnea
  reported: &quot;Within hours a whole edifice of rationalization was built, according to
  which Goldstein had allegedly been under unbearable mental pressure, because he had to
  attend so many wounded and dead [persons], including Arabs.&quot; 'Me men who <br>
  propagated this lie knew that Goldstein had refused to treat Arabs. Bamea continued:
  &quot;Thus, the Arabs were made guilty for what he could not avoid doing. The implication
  was that the Arabs assaulted him rather than the other way around and that he really acted
  for the benefit of the <br>
  Arabs by letting them finally realize that Jewish blood could not be shed with
  impunity.&quot; This brazen lie was maintained as long as possible before being abandoned
  without apology. The -propagation of such a lie reveals the influence of Jewish
  fundamentalism upon the secular parts of the Israeli establishment. <br>
  Goldstein represented Jewish fundamentalism in the extreme. Some of the Gush Emunim
  leaders at the time of the massacre were only a bit less extreme. Barnea compared
  Goldstein's attitude <br>
  toward non-Jews with that of Rabbi Levinger, the Gush Emunim leader whom he interviewed on
  the day of the massacre: <br>
  Levinger was in a good mood; after arguing about how religious settlers should respond to
  the massacre, he shortly before had won the three hour debate at a session of the Kiryat
  Arba municipality. The secretary of the Council of Judea, Samara and Gaza District, Uri
  Ariel, [who became director of the prime minister's office in 19981 proposed condemning
  the massacre. Levinger staked his authority behind the proposal that the [Israeli]
  government should instead be condemned [for putting Goldstein] under unbearable mental
  pressure [propelling him to action]. <br>
  <br>
  In the discussion the terms &quot;murder,&quot; &quot;massacre&quot; or
  &quot;killing&quot; were avoided; instead the terms used were &quot;deed,&quot;
  &quot;event&quot; or &#147;occurrence.&#148; The reason is that according to the Halacha
  the killing by a Jew of a non-Jew under any circumstances is not regarded as murder. It
  may be prohibited for other reasons, especially when it causes danger for Jews. In many
  cases the real feelings about a Jew murdering non-Jews, expressed in Israel with impunity,
  correspond to the law. Levinger told Barnea that the resolution &quot;expresses in
  passing&quot; the sorrow about dead Arabs &quot;even though it emphasizes the
  responsibility of the government.&quot; When asked by Barnea whether he felt sorry,
  Levinger answered: &quot;I am sorry not only about dead Arabs but also about dead
  flies.&quot; <br>
  Goldstein on principle had refused to treat non-Jews for many years before the massacre.
  He worked as the municipal doctor of Kiryat Arba and treated Arabs only when he could not
  avoid doing so. Barnea quoted one of Goldstein's colleagues from the Kiryat Arba clinic
  who recalled that &quot;whenever Goldstein arrived at a traffic accident spot and
  recognized that some of the injured were Arabs, he would attend to them but only until
  another doctor arrived. Then, he would stop treating them. &#145;This was his compromise
  between his doctor's oath and his ideology,' said his colleague.&quot; <br>
  The Halacha enjoins precisely the behavior of Goldstein's refusing to attend non-Jews. The
  <br>
  Halacha dictates that a pious Jewish doctor may treat Gentiles when his refusal to do so
  might be reported to the authorities and cause him or other Jews unpleasantness. There is
  reason to believe that whenever doctors as pious as Goldstein were forced to treat Arabs
  they behaved as did Goldstein. In his previously cited <i>Yediot Ahronot</i> article,
  Arych Kizel added that the Israeli army found that Goldstein's conduct did not require any
  disciplinary measures. A <i>Maariv</i> orrespondent wrote in his March 8, 1994 article
  that Goldstein's military service record was sufficiently distinguished to earn him a
  ceremonial promotion from the rank of captain to that of major. The president of Israel
  would have officially awarded this promotion on April 14, 1994, Israel's independence day.
  Only Goldstein's death, which occurred at the time of the massacre, prevented what would
  have been a revealing promotion. </p>
