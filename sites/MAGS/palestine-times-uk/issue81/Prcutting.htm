<P><FONT SIZE=+1>JERUSALEM, Israel's Mossad intelligence service, rocked
by a  botched assassination attempt in Jordan last fall and the resignation
of  its director , braced for more bad news today. According to  sketchy
reports in the Israeli media, another Mossad operation went  wrong last
week, this time in Switzerland. No details were available on the latest
Mossad mishap, which apparently  resulted in the arrest of at least one
Israeli citizen in Switzerland,  according to a source with knowledge of
the incident.  Swiss television reported from Geneva that &quot;the suspect
is accused of  having conducted espionage with eavesdropping devices.&quot;
It quoted  sources in Bern, the Swiss capital, as saying at least one Mossad
 operative was taken into custody last week.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>DURA, West Bank - Last week, this Palestinian town was
in tumult.  Demonstrators burned American flags and clashed with Israeli
soldiers in  a violent display of support for Saddam Hussein. That defiance
has now given way to debate. And as the threat of a  US-Iraqi conflict has
eased, attention in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza  has swung back to the
faltering peace process. Today, these Palestinians  wonder if their demonstration,
like others across the Arab world, will  help or hinder the region's stalled
quest for peace in the wake of what  appears to be the end of the Iraqi
crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For many in the Arab world, the recent high-stakes US-Iraq
standoff over  United Nations weapons inspectors has brought to a boil long-growing
 disillusionment with US Mideast policy. Before UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan traveled to Baghdad to broker a  peaceful solution over the weekend,
violent pro-Iraq demonstrations in  the Palestinian territories and Jordan
pointed to the depth of unrest  that has grown in the past year and a half,
as the Arab-Israeli peace  process has all but collapsed. But underlying
this disillusionment, Arab analysts say, is a fundamental  reexamination
of how America's role in the Middle East is perceived.  Across the region,
few Arab leaders supported military strikes against  Iraq, saying that the
Iraqi people would suffer more than the regime of  President Saddam Hussein.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the standoff between Iraq and the US, one of the
repeated  criticisms by some Arab countries of Washington's policy towards
Baghdad  was its double standards. If, as President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
argued, the US was forcing Iraq  to comply with United Nations resolutions,
why did it not exert the  slightest pressure on Israel over its flouting
of UN resolutions.  Some Arab leaders also argued that if the US demanded
that Iraq should  open up its stocks of weapons of mass destruction to inspection,
why did  it not apply the same pressure on Israel. If such weapons contribute
to  instability in the region, should Israel not be called to book as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> In common with the rest of the region, the president (Mubarak
of Egypt) - who came to power  in 1981 after his predecessor Anwar Sadat
was assassinated by Islamists  from the Egyptian army - fears a popular
backlash sweeping across the  Middle East and beyond. In this view, the
Arab masses are likely to react with fury to a US that brooks no compromise
with Iraq while apparently tolerating Israel's failure to abide by its peace
commitments  to the Palestinians - as well as Israel's unacknowledged possession
of  nuclear warheads. &quot;We have to deal with public opinion in the Arab
and Islamic world, and  we are going to face a hell of a problem. This is
very dangerous - I  cannot stand against the whole weight of popular opinion,&quot;
the president  said. He thinks Mr Saddam has sensed, correctly, that popular
sentiment  in the Arab world has swung to his side. &quot;This is not 1991,&quot;
Mr Mubarak emphasised. The US has lost credibility in the Middle East. As
well as the UN sanctions on Iraq, Washington has imposed sanctions on Libya,
Iran and Sudan, but &quot;done nothing about the Middle East peace process.
This is what the people say. And then they  see that the US is preparing
to attack Iraq&quot; for refusing to yield up  all its weapons, while &quot;at
the same time, the Israelis have weapons of  mass destruction and they say
nothing&quot;.</FONT></P>
