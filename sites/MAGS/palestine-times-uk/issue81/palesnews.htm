<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian anger at American double standards</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Like many in the Arab world, Palestinians breathed a sigh
of relief following the conclusion of the last-minute agreement between
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership. PA Chairman Yasser
Arafat referred to the agreement as &quot;the good news from Baghdad,&quot;
and expressed the hope that the world, particularly the United States, would
now pay equal attention to the Palestinian issue. Arafat's almost &quot;wishful
thinking&quot; reflected the overall Palestinian indignation at what was
described as the &quot;American's obsessive desire to attack Iraq.&quot;
That indignation was manifest throughout the autonomous enclaves and took
the form of vociferous protests organized mostly by Yasser Arafat's own
PLO faction, Fatah, and the pro-Iraqi Arab Liberation Front. So, in every
Palestinian locality, the public mood was decidedly anti-American if only
because of the &quot;the scandalous double standards&quot; governing American
policy toward Iraq and Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So the words were on everybody's mind and tongue: &quot;Why
don't they (the U.S.) force Israel to comply with UN resolutions as they
are doing with Iraq? Why?&quot; For most Palestinians, the answer is all
too clear: The U.S. doesn't possess the will nor the inclination to put
an end to Israeli defiance of UN resolutions as manifested in the ongoing
building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For many ordinary Palestinians, the new American-led crusade
against Iraq has nothing to do in reality with the alleged hiding of weapons
of mass destruction in the so-called presidential sites. In fact, some Palestinians
have even come to think that the Americans were not after Saddam Hussein
after all. Their rationale is that the Iraqi leader is serving the strategic
and geopolitical interests of the United States in the region since the
continuous crises he instigates provide the Americans with the pretext to
maintain substantial American presence in the oil-rich Gulf area, in essence
establishing and consolidating direct American military hegemony in the
region.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Such words, however, sound too academic and too sophisticated
to be understood, much less believed, by the rabble.  Indeed, they had virtually
no bearing on the several thousand Palestinians who took to the streets
in support of the &quot;Iraqi people&quot; and against &quot;American bellicosity
and arrogance of power.&quot; The demonstrators shouted anti-American and
anti-Israeli slogans, and held Saddam Hussein's portrait aloft, along with
that of Yasser Arafat. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We cannot remain silent when the cowboys are about
to rain death on Baghdad. Men, women and children will be the victims,&quot;
protested a middle-aged demonstrator outside the Dheishe refugee camp near
Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The pro-Iraqi, anti-American protests in much of the West
Bank (the Gaza Strip witnessed fewer protests due to stringent enforcement
of the PA ban on pro-Iraqi demonstrations) proved a sensational item for
the Israeli media and a definite propagandistic food-for-thought for the
Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu who charged that Palestinian support
for Iraq was proof that the Palestinians were seeking Israel's eradication.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's remarks along with reported American criticisms
of the pro-Iraqi demonstrations and rallies within the autonomous enclaves
eventually prompted Yasser Arafat to order his obsequious Gaza Police Chief
Ghazi al Jabali to issue an &quot;absolute ban on all demonstrations.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To appease the Israelis and impress Arafat, Jabali (who
led the PA campaign against Hamas in Gaza in the spring of 1996) actually
appeared on Israeli television ordering his subordinate police commanders
to &quot;break the necks of demonstrators.&quot; The remarks were too unpalatable
for the Palestinian public opinion. Legislative Council members called his
remarks &quot;venomous and scandalous,&quot; and urged Arafat to fire him
immediately. In the streets of Ramallah, hundreds of protesters, including
leading Fatah activists, shouted &quot;Ya Jabali Ya Amil&quot; (Jabali collaborator.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The escalation of pro-Iraqi protests proved very embarrassing
for Arafat who came to find himself unenviably pressed between the American-Israeli
hammer and the anvil of the Palestinian public opinion, prompting PA police
to move against private radio and television stations which devoted detailed
coverage of the protests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 16 February, a huge PA police contingent made up of
120 policemen surrounded and stormed the &quot;shepherds&quot; local TV
station in Bethlehem, serving the station a written order to close down
its transmission for having shown footage containing the burning of the
American flag and for hosting a phone-in programme during which viewers
made calls expressing support for Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 17 February, a local radio station in Ramallah, &quot;Sawt
al Hub wa Salam&quot; (Voice of Love and Peace) was forced by the PA to
sign off early also for broadcasting news of pro-Iraqi protests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The following day, the PA Minister of Information, Yasser
Abed Rabbu, issued a decree ordering the closure of five more TV stations
and three radio stations in the West Bank &quot;in observance of order and
in compliance with laws and in order to organize the work of audio-visual
broadcasters.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The closed stations included Qasre al Nil TV in Nablus,
al Fajr al Jadid in Tulkarm, Hebron Radio (FM) in Hebron, Watani Atlas TV
in Nablus, Tulkarm Central TV in Tulkarm, al Bilad Radio also in Tulkarm,
al Awael TV in Jenin, and Naghem Radio in Qalqilia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, the Ministry of Information delivered a memo to
radio and TV stations throughout the West Bank ordering them to avoid transmitting
Palestinian views on the Iraqi standoff with the United States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The attack on press freedom, say human rights organizations,
proves once again that the PA values the &quot;legitimacy&quot; that comes
from Israeli and American acceptance more than that which comes from the
Palestinian people.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Netanyahu seeks to restore &quot;past glory&quot;
to the Mossad</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> In light of the Ciechanover Committee report that looked
into the Mossad's bungled attempt on Hamas political chief in Amman, Khalid
Misha'al, in September of 1997, it seems that the Israeli premier Netanyahu
not only succeeded in overcoming the effects of the botched operation, but
is actually planning to use the affair to restructure the Mossad in the
hope of restoring some of its traditional notoriety.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Ciechanover Committee, an innocuous body made up of
Netanyahu's friends and allies, didn't blame Netanyahu for ordering the
assassination attempt in the first place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Instead, the Committee report criticized the various stages
of the operation, including the &quot;planning and execution&quot; and the
&quot;unprofessional manner&quot; in which it was carried out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the report gave every impression that the &quot;concept
of the operation&quot; was not a bad idea, regardless of various considerations,
including &quot;the relations with Jordan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, it is amply safe to assume that Netanyahu is waiting
for the opportune time to &quot;clean out the Mossad,&quot; including the
ultimate firing of Mossad's present chief, Danny Yatom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu, though, is not expected to carry out the &quot;clean-up&quot;
in a dramatic way lest he appear as a vindictive premier who sacrifices
parochial party considerations at the expense of national considerations
and interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Yatom should be viewed as a virtual &quot;lame duck&quot;
for two reasons:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>First, his continued presence at the helm of the Mossad
is likely to prevent an effective resumption of the vital intelligence and
security coordination and cooperation with Jordan, particularly in the field
of &quot;monitoring Islamist elements on both sides of the River Jordan.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Needless to say, successive Israeli governments have always
attached &quot;paramount significance&quot; to intelligence cooperation
with Jordan, which explains why the Netanyahu government is making strenuous
efforts to persuade King Hussein to allow the reopening of the Mossad office
in the Jordanian capital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, the Mossad office in Amman, an annex to
the Israeli embassy, played a key role in providing the logistics for the
eight Mossad agents who took part in the failed attempt on Misha'al's life,
which ostensibly infuriated King Hussein and made him insist on the removal
of Yatom from the Mossad before any resumption of intelligence cooperation
between Jordan and Israel would take place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The second reason behind the contemplated clean-up of the
Mossad is the reported obsessive desire on the part of the Israeli Prime
Minister to restore the &quot;past glory&quot; to an organization that had
acquired an unmatched reputation through the execution of spectacular operations
such as the abduction from South America in the early 1960s of Adolph Eichman
and the implanting of Eli Cohen in the top Syrian government echelon in
the mid-1960s, as well as the subsequent assassination of numerous PLO leaders
in Europe and the Arab world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to an Israeli source, Netanyahu's desire to &quot;purify&quot;
the &quot;ideological blemish&quot; stems from his conviction that the political
views of people like Yatom influence the kind of recommendations they make
on the political level.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, this is not &quot;news&quot; in the intelligence
world, the Mossad included. Last December, a right-wing Mossad official,
Yehuda Gill, confessed to having forwarded &quot;concocted information&quot;
about alleged Syrian intentions to attack Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In light of this, it seems that Netanyahu doesn't really
aim to &quot;curb the politicization&quot; of the Mossad as much as he wants
to give it free rein to &quot;act wherever and whenever necessary for the
security interests of Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, Netanyahu made no secret of his peculiar understanding
of the Ciechanover Committee report, e.g. that it gives him a green light
to carry out assassination attempts on the soil of friendly and unfriendly
countries alike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, following the release of the report, Netanyahu
told Israeli TV that &quot;we will continue to chase the terrorists wherever
and whenever needed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, what Netanyahu seemed to be saying to people like
King Hussein of Jordan is something like this: &quot;Look! We will continue
to act as we have always done, but next time we will make sure it won't
be bungled.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israelis' behaviour during crisis underscores</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> psychological vulnerability</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The scene was all too familiar. Thousands of phobic-like,
panic-stricken Israelis stood in long columns, queuing up for gas masks,
antibiotics and other protective means to shield themselves against a possible
Iraqi attack on Israel.  The rowdy crowds squabbled, quarreled and cursed,
vying for the &quot;life-savers&quot; as if death was imminent.  The hysteria
was also evident at supermarkets and grocery stores throughout pre-1967
Palestine where Israeli Jews of all ages queued up for canned food, especially
tuna fish, but also for plastic sheets and paste tape in order to hermetically
seal their rooms in case of an attack with chemical or biological agents.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, others were booking the first available flights
to Europe and North America where they perceived they would be safe from
a nightmare that is a psychotic state of mind rather than a factual reality.
 Ehud Olmert, the Israeli mayor of Occupied Jerusalem, thought the hysteria
was an affront, was disgraceful and showed &quot;the utter psychological
vulnerability of Israelis.&quot; He said in a radio interview that the collective
panic and phobia showed the Israelis as one who conceded defeat even before
the beginning of the battle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli writers and journalists were more frank. A columnist
in the mass circulation daily <I>Yediot Ahronot </I>exhorted Israelis to
learn from the Palestinians who are almost totally exposed and possess no
protection whatsoever against a chemical or biological attack.  Israeli
television, over-imbibing the collective hysteria, apparently couldn't impress
upon their viewers the fact that the Palestinians were behaving not only
normally but also with serenity and calm. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli TV reporter expressed surprise at the &quot;business-as-usual
manner&quot; in Palestinian streets, fields and work places. One elderly
Palestinian, plowing his land, was asked by the Israeli reporter if he was
concerned about an Iraqi attack with chemical gas. The Palestinian said
laconically &quot;<I>Allah Byerhamna</I>&quot; (God will protect us). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The reporter, unmoved by the simplicity and innocence of
the Palestinian's response, opined to the mostly Hebrew-speaking audience
that &quot;sweeping fatalism and stupidity&quot; characterized Palestinian
behaviour in the face of a possible Iraqi attack.  Unsure of the accuracy
of his words and thoughts, the reporter then asked &quot;why wouldn't the
heavily protected Israelis, who have the IDF and the United States at their
beck and call, behave 'naturally' like the Palestinians?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not clear why Israelis behave as such during crises,
often seeking double and triple protection. Could it be the exaggerated
Jewish fear of death as mentioned in the Qur'an: <I>&quot;And thou will
find them greediest of mankind for life and even greedier than </I>the idolaters.
Each one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And
<I>to live (a thousand years) would by no means remove him from the doom.
For God is </I>All-Seer of what they do.&quot; (Sura: II, v. 96).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>US committee expresses concern over PA's closing of Palestinian
broadcast</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The US Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) expressed
concern about recent efforts by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to silence
private broadcasting in the West Bank, which, the committee said, violates
international standards for free expression. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a directive issued to the Palestinian media on February
15, the Ministry of Information banned all broadcasting of opinion and analysis
about the current standoff between United Nations weapons inspectors and
Iraq. Journalists and observers in the West Bank have interpreted the move
as an attempt by the PA to curtail media coverage of pro-Iraqi sentiment
among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. According to Reuters, the
ministry said that its decision to impose the ban was to safeguard  &quot;higher
Palestinian national interests and for the sake of protecting Palestinian
security.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One day after the ban was implemented, more than 100 police
surrounded the offices Al-Roa', a private television station in Bethlehem,
and forced the station to suspend broadcasting for violating the ban. Al-Roa'
had earlier broadcast news about pro-Iraqi demonstrations in the West Bank
and had aired a program where viewers were able to phone in to express solidarity
with Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In an apparent effort to further ensure compliance with
the ministry's ban, Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jebali on February 18
asked television and radio stations to sign pledges that they would refrain
from broadcasting &quot;any news or footage of mass demonstrations or any
other sensitive materials,&quot; or face closure, the Associated Press reported
yesterday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a letter to Chairman Arafat of the PA signed by the
CPJ's Executive Director, William A. Orme, Jr., the committee also expressed
its deeply concern about the February 17 decision by police, requiring broadcasters
to obtain new licenses from the Ministry of Interior. &quot;Stations have
been given one week to comply with the new regulation or face closure. Palestinian
officials have yet to specify the requirements for obtaining the license.
CPJ fears that this new licensing procedure may be used by authorities as
a pretext to rein in independent broadcasters. CPJ has learned that on February
18, authorities closed down eight unlicensed television and radio stations
which had been broadcasting for several months. Some of the stations had
reportedly applied for licensing and were awaiting formal decisions on their
applications,&quot; the CPJ pointed out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;As a nonpartisan organization of journalists dedicated
to the defense of our colleagues' rights throughout the world, CPJ views
the PA's implementation of coverage bans and the closure of Al-Roa' as flagrant
violations of the right to &quot;seek, receive, and impart information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers,&quot; as guaranteed
by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> The committee urged Mr. Arafat to consider several recommendations
aimed at bringing the PA's practices in accordance with international standards
for a free press. These recommendations included:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Rescind the Ministry of Information's ban on media
coverage and permit Al-Roa' to resume broadcasting immediately; State publicly
that the Palestinian National Authority accepts the principle that it has
a duty under internationally recognized norms of free expression to allow
journalists to disseminate a diversity of views, even if these views are
opposed to or critical of prevailing policies; Ensure that any licensing
or regulation of the broadcast media be carried out by an independent body
to ensure non-discrimination in the awarding of licenses, and ensure that
stations applying for permits be allowed to broadcast freely while their
applications are under review.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Demonstration for the people of Iraq in Bethlehem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bethlehem- From Steve Sozby</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The combination of Israeli intransigence in the so-called
&quot;peace process&quot; and of the U.S. pressing for another violent showdown
with Iraq, tension in the West Bank is at a boiling point.  I recently drove
on the main Hebron-Jerusalem road through Bethlehem on a Saturday morning
while school was getting out. Young Palestinian kids from the nearby Aida
refugee camp were wrapping shirts around their faces while gathering stones
not far from Israeli troops guarding Rachel's Tomb. Just two months ago,
a 9-year-old boy was shot in the head and killed at the same location. I
was killing time, not children, so I stopped to see how far the kids would
press the Israeli enclave a mile south of their military checkpoint cutting
off the West Bank from Jerusalem.    </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israelis sent a message when they shot dead the 9-year-old,
as few of the kids would get close enough to the battle-clad IDF troops
to even hit one on a bounce. Kids were using slingshots and the old Biblical
slings to hurl projectiles, but none of the 8- and 9-year-olds wanted to
get shot, so they kept a safe distance. Eventually the bored IDF commander
gave the order to close the main road from Palestinian traffic and to shoot
tear gas at the kids. Five of the six canisters of C-1 were fired at where
we were standing, and a few brave youths threw them back at the soldiers.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An IDF sniper team was sent out to set up an ambush on
the kids near Bint Jibreel refugee camp, which overlooks the main road where
the kids were throwing stones. Before they could start shooting at the children,
a larger demonstration emerged from the centre of Bethlehem.  This one included
older youths wearing Keffiyas to cover their face.  They also had members
of the Palestinian Authority police among them trying to encourage them
not to march on the Israeli occupation forces.  There was a large Palestinian
flag and an Iraqi flag.  Two youths emerged with an American and an Israeli
flag, which were set on fire while the crowd chanted in Arabic: &quot;Clinton,
you pimp, leave Iraq alone.&quot; The IDF snipers started to shoot at the
demonstrators and the PA police, which set off a clash that resulted in
14 Palestinians being shot and much more tear gas being fired into the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians are not demonstrating in favour of Saddam
as a great leader. There is much sympathy on the streets of the West Bank
and Gaza for the great suffering that the people of Iraq are enduring, as
well as anger at the double standard of the Americans. &quot;Israel defies
U.N. resolutions at will, occupying our land, building settlements and using
the Fourth Geneva Convention as toilet paper,&quot; said Mohammed Al-Akeel,
one of the organizers of the demonstration in support for Iraq.  &quot;Meanwhile,
Iraq has been starved and bombed back to the 13th century for suspected
transgressions.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is no doubt that the arrogance of the U.S. and Britain
in the Middle East will have very negative long-term political consequences
should they choose to use military force again against Iraq. There is not
the same level of support for such actions even among the Gulf States, who
traditionally do not oppose U.S. policy in the region.  Clinton, of course,
is seeking ways to turn attention away from his scandal at home and is not
as concerned about the reaction of the Arab world to the deep hypocrisy
of the U.S. It is this mixture of scandal and arrogance that may lead the
U.S. to wreak further havoc and deep suffering on the already miserable
people of Iraq.  </FONT></P>

of power&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>Occupied Jerusalem (16 February)</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Palestinian Islamists have urged Arab heads of State to
hasten to save the Iraqi people from &quot;the imminent American aggression,&quot;
a leaflet signed by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) said on 16 February.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet pointed out that the United States was &quot;going
too far in its insolence and arrogance of power by preparing to strike at
the Iraqi people, who have been debilitated by seven years of oppressive
sanctions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet went on: &quot;With a cowboy mentality,  America
is launching a blind and evil crusade to protect its strategic interests...without
ethics, save the ethics of naked military force, and without principles
and humanitarian considerations.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet exposed the &quot;stark double standards&quot;
adopted by the American administration vis-a-vis Iraq and &quot;Israeli-Zionist
brutal oppression and torment of the Palestinian people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the leaflet expressed appreciation for the Saudi
Arabian refusal to allow American war planes to use Saudi soil as &quot;a
launching pad&quot; for aggression against Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, 13 February, Islamist speakers in mosques throughout
the occupied territories called on the Muslim Umma to resist American hegemony,
saying the U.S. was not only after Iraq but after any and every country
that refuses to budge to American imperialism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Never the less, one speaker, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub of the
Grand Mosque in Dura, opined that the &quot;fault lies not in the United
States but in the Muslim Umma itself.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The fault is not with America, which seeks to subjugate
and humiliate us, but in our Umma and its leaders, who readily accept American
hegemony.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub said it was a foregone conclusion that Saddam Hussein
is a brutal and ruthless despot, adding, however, that the United States
was not after Saddam, who, he said, was serving American interests in the
region, but was rather after  &quot;Iraq's recovery potentials.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Friday imam at al Masjidul Aqsa essentially repeated
the same theme, urging Muslim leaders &quot;to awaken from their deadly
silence and cowardly posture.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;When Saddam Hussein struck Tehran with long-range
rockets, the U.S. and the West in general actually helped him, but when
there was even a prospect of his missiles reaching the &quot;State of oppression&quot;
(Israel), the world wasted not a moment in attacking and destroying him,&quot;
the imam said during the Juma'a sermon on Friday.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (23 February)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1>  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli officials reacted with a combination of consternation
and ambivalence to the agreement reached in Baghdad on Monday between U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu told reporters
that Saddam Hussein gave in to American demands, adding that there was no
reason why the United States shouldn't go ahead with plans to attack Iraq
if it emerged that the Iraqi leader didn't fully succumb to American conditions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu, who came under severe criticisms from the leftist
opposition for showing poor brinkmanship, said the Israeli position throughout
the crisis was right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that &quot;our enemies knew our force of deterrence
before and after the crisis.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Netanyahu critics described his words as &quot;verbal
juggling.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist party Merets, described
Netanyahu as a big impostor who shams statesmanship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sarid accused Netanyahu of creating false hysteria in the
Israeli society, arguing that Israel was the main loser in the Iraqi crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Government ministers didn't hesitate to express outright
dismay at the agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Health Minister Joshua Matsa said he was not happy nor
sad at the agreement, adding that a new crisis would unfold sooner or later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He urged the United States to keep its armada of warships
and aircraft carriers in the Gulf on a permanent basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The same call was also made by Avigodor Kahlani, Minister
of Internal Security, who expressed ambivalence with the Baghdad agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kahlani told the Israeli radio &quot;Voice of Israel&quot;
that Saddam Hussein would continue to pose a threat to Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He also alluded to Iran as &quot;an important threat to
Israel and American interests in the region.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>removing terrorist's tomb</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>Occupied Jerusalem</B> <B>- PT</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jewish extremists  warned the Israeli government against
removing the tomb of Baruch Goldstein from Kiryat Arba'a, threatening to
&quot;turn the world upside down in case the tomb was tinkered with.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Goldstein is the Jewish terrorist who on 25 February 1994
massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron before
he was killed by survivors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ever since his death on the day of the massacre, Goldstein's
tomb has become a pilgrimage site for Jews from places as far away as California.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Baruch Marzel, a friend of Goldstein, said in a radio interview
last month that he, along with his friends, would &quot;turn the world upside
down&quot; if the remains of Goldstein were removed from Kiryat Arba'a.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Marzel, a leading member of the terrorist Jewish movement
&quot;Kach,&quot; added that any tinkering with &quot;the sacred tomb of
the saint Baruch Goldstein&quot; would spark off unpredictable reactions
from many Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Marzel's vitriolic threats came in reaction to a Knesset
proposal tabled by the Israeli parliamentarian Dudy Tsuker calling for the
removal of a memorial plaque atop Goldstein's tomb and transferring his
remains to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the motion calls for the incrimination of activities
and actions proscribing sanctity to terrorists and their places of burial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Tsuker's motion was labelled as &quot;evil and repulsive&quot;
by Kiryat Arba'a settlers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The settlement chief rabbi, Dov Leor, described Tsuker's
proposal as &quot;inimical to Jewish traditions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Leor is considered among the leading advocates of  &quot;Goldsteinism&quot;,
the Jewish equivalent of Nazism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Last year, he published a book glorifying and lionizing
the terrorist Goldstein. He described him as &quot;a great saint&quot; whose
action would herald the age of redemption for the Jewish people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Leor teaches his many disciples that the blood
of Jews is redder than that of non-Jews, suggesting that God prefers Jews
to non-Jews.</FONT></P>

affair</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman (Star) </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Jordan condemned
conclusions of an official inquiry into the Mossad's botched assassination
attempt of Hamas leader Khaled Misha'al for endorsing political killings
by the Israeli government. Several Jordanian officials considered the outcome
of the investigation as posing new Israeli threats to strike again at Palestinian
activists in Amman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lower House Speaker, Saad Hayel Al Srour described the
report issued by the Israeli committee set to inquire the bungled assassination
attempt as a bid for further violations on Jordanian territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In London, Amnesty International released a statement criticizing
the outcome of the Israeli official inquiry. &quot;As we predicted, the
committee of inquiry has concentrated on the reasons why the attempted assassination
failed rather than the illegality of the botched killing. Now it has given
the green light to State-sanctioned murder,&quot; Amnesty International
said. It demanded the Israeli government to abide by its commitments under
international law and to respect the right to life and immediately cease
the use of extrajudicial executions, whoever may be the target.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Authority has reached an agreement with
the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) to
organize an international conference on Palestine in mid-1998. The conference
will be one of the activities to be organized by the PA commemorating the
1948 usurping of Palestine by the Zionist State. The agreement, which was
signed by the PA Minister of Information Yasser Abed Rabbu and the ISESCO
Director-General Abdel Aziz Tuwaijre, also included the establishment of
a Palestinian museum in Ramallah, and the production of a film documenting
the sufferings of the Palestinian national struggle over the past 50 years.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>$300 million losses of Israeli tourism because
of tension in the region</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (QP)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - An
Israeli report estimated the losses of the Israeli tourist sector during
1997 at $300 million. The Israeli tourism officials attributed the losses
to the tension in the region and mainly the bombings in the occupied territories
that resulted in the reduced number of foreign tourists. The report pointed
out that about 2 million tourists visited Israel in 1997 compared to 2.2
million in 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, another Israeli report speculated that the Israeli
losses were a result of car thefts, estimated at $2.2 billion during the
past five years. The report published by the Yediot Aharonot daily said
that about 166,000 cars were stolen from the 1948-occupied Palestine in
the past five years, including about 46,000 cars stolen in 1997 alone. The
report issued by the Union of Israeli insurance companies pointed out that
71% of the stolen cars were not found.</FONT></P>

5 in 1996 and the same number in 1997, and one citizen died since the beginning

reasons.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus (West Bank) QP</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - A number
of Palestinian detainees (under 18 years of age) in the Israeli Talmund
jail called on the human rights organizations to pressure Israeli occupation
authorities to alleviate their suffering in the jail. They asserted that
their families have not been allowed to visit them for the past seven months.
The prisoners pointed out that a Palestinian woman from the Gaza Strip was
prevented from visiting her son as well as her husband, who was sentenced
to life imprisonment and who is dying at the hospital of the Israeli Ramleh
jail. The report said that 73% of the 560 Palestinian prisoners in the jail
are supporters of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas.</FONT></P>
