<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Time to Challenge American Piracy</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite the 23 February agreement between UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the United States is continuing
to beat the drums of war. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>American officials, from Bill Clinton downward, are making
no secret of their dissatisfaction with the last-minute accords which fortunately
forestalled a blanket bombing of Baghdad that would have left countless
of innocent Iraqis either dead, incinerated or mutilated.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact that Saddam Hussein caved in to American dictates
and international demands, if only to save his tormented people from further
suffering, was apparently bad news for the White House, and especially for
the evil but influential trio of Madeleine Albright, William Cohen and Sandy
Burger. The three Zionist Jews were reportedly hell-bent to bomb-out Baghdad
&quot;once and for all&quot; in order to &quot;establish American hegemony
in the Gulf.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That was the declared goal of the American-led build-up,
unprecedented since the second Gulf War in 1991. The other undeclared goal,
however, has to do with Israel (Bill Clinton's organ grinder) and is aimed
at preventing &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; from falling into
the &quot;wrong hands.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But then who would decide which hands are &quot;right and
which are wrong?&quot; And if the &quot;irresponsible use&quot; of weapons
of mass destruction is the &quot;red line,&quot; what can we make then of
the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs dropped on the
two Japanese towns by the Americans in 1945; and the spraying of Vietnamese
jungles with chemical agents which destroyed life and habitats? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Truly, the American-led crusade in the Gulf demonstrated
in a stark manner the oppressive arrogance of power of a nation claiming
to be an exemplary model for other nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That arrogance would have easily turned into &quot;genocidal
murder on a colossal scale&quot; had not Saddam Hussein decided to be &quot;wise.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One need not be a great military expert to imagine the
widespread death and destruction in Baghdad if the trigger-happy Americans
decided to go ahead with bombing the Iraqi capital, especially the &quot;controversial
sites&quot; where they alleged the Iraqi leadership is hiding chemical and
bacterial weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Never the less, the Arab-Muslim peoples in the area and
in far-outlying lands must start to speak out against their autocratic and
authoritarian regimes' subservience to American hegemony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The peoples and the elite must realize that the real problem
does not lie in American hegemony, but in our vulnerability to accepting,
even welcoming, our grave-diggers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The masses must learn how to make their voices heard, first
and foremost, by Arab leaders, who in times of crises act as American high-commissioners
responsible to the White House irrespective of their peoples' feelings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The anti-American protests, which took place in several
Arab countries, were an encouraging sign upon which more popular involvement
can be built. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As Arabs and Muslims, we must take our fate into our own
hands and immediately do away with inaction and passivity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We must take to the streets whenever needed in order to
convey an unmistakable message to our dictators and dynastic despots who
drive herds over us that the old days are over for good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the evil cowboys would have treated us lightly
had they thought that our leaders were accountable to us more than to them.</FONT></P>
