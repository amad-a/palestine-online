<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Israel depopulates Jerusalem of its Palestinian
citizens</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Mahmoud al Khatib</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>According to the Declaration of Principles signed in September
1993 between Israel and the PLO, the status of Occupied Jerusalem
was decided to be one of the issues in the agenda of the final
status negotiations, which were supposed to commence last year.
East Jerusalem, which was occupied in June 1967, is part and parcel
of the West Bank of the Jordan River that the UN Security Council's
resolution 242 orders Israel to withdraw from.</P>

<P>It is worth mentioning that even West Jerusalem, now a purely
Jewish district, was mainly inhabited by Arabs when it was occupied
by the Jews in 1948. About 80,000 Palestinians were driven out
of their homes in West Jerusalem and the neighbouring villages
of Deir Yassin, Ein Karem and Lifta. The Israeli parliament, known
as the Knesset, is built on land belonging to Lifta, northwest
of Jerusalem. In 1948, 40% of the property of West Jerusalem belonged
to Palestinian families, 34% to the Islamic Waqf, churches and
the Government of Palestine, and only 26% belonged to the Jews.</P>

<P>On 2 February 1949, the Israeli newly established government,
led by Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, declared that West Jerusalem
was no longer an occupied territory but rather an integral part
of the Jewish State. On 13 December of the same year, the Israeli
government illegally declared West Jerusalem the capital of Israel.</P>

<P>The section of Arab East Jerusalem that extended over an area
of 6.5 square kilometres as of 5 June 1967 was annexed to the
Israeli State on 28 June in the same year, along with 28 surrounding
villages. Israel now claims that the unified Jerusalem (east and
west) is the eternal capital of the Jewish State. The annexation
of Arab Jerusalem and some surrounding villages was carefully
designed to secure geographic integrity and a demographic Jewish
superiority in both parts of Jerusalem. Therefore, many Palestinian-populated
areas in the vicinity of Arab Jerusalem, namely Al-Ram, Abu Dees,
Ezariya and Qalandia refugee camp, were excluded.</P>

<P>Israel's policies pertaining to Jerusalem were masterminded
by former mayor Teddy Kollek, whose plans and policies are carried
out until this day with full support from the Israeli government.
These policies are based on the idea of establishing a Greater
Jerusalem that includes the Old City (Arab Jerusalem) and vast
areas of the surrounding suburbs and villages in all directions.
At the present time, the Old City is now encircled by 16 Jewish
settlements with a population of more than 167,000 Jews compared
with 155,000 Palestinians living in East Jerusalem even though
the Jewish population on 5 June 1967 was zero. These settlements
form two rings around the city, isolating Arab East Jerusalem
and cutting the West Bank in half: the inner ring in East Jerusalem
and the outer ring (Greater Jerusalem) reaching far into the West
Bank. All these settlements are built on land belonging to Palestinian
Jerusalemite families and other families from the nearby villages.
The Israeli strategy of &quot;Judaization&quot; involves the confiscation
of the Old City (which includes the Holy Shrine of Al Aqsa Mosque,
Islamic Waqf and also some Christian places) and the surrounding
areas. The &quot;Greater Jerusalem&quot; plan is more of a political
rather than a geographical concept that follows Israel's vision
of a metropolitan Jerusalem stretching from Ramallah (north) to
Hebron (south) and from Bet Shemesh (west) to Jericho (east),
covering 30% of the West Bank.</P>

<P>The Israeli government adopted a number of measures to Judaize
the Holy City and make the Jewish settlers outnumber the Arab
Palestinians in East Jerusalem. These measures include the &quot;transfer&quot;
policy, which involves the confiscation of residency rights and
ID cards, demolition of houses, and economic and security pressures
in order to force the Arab citizens to leave their city. The natural
growth has nothing to do with the demographic imbalance in favour
of the Jews but rather with the Israeli unjust measures. An Israeli
ministerial committee decided that making the Jews a majority
of 76% of Jerusalem's population compared with 24% for the Arab
Palestinians is a strategic goal for Israel and that goal should
be implemented gradually. The Israeli Jerusalem Post expected
the population of Jerusalem (West and East Jerusalem) in the year
2010 to exceed 817,000, of which the Arab citizens will comprise
only 251,000 (31%).</P>

<P>Fearing the growth of Palestinian population in Jerusalem,
the Israeli government took several arbitrary measures to drive
Palestinians out of their Holy City. It considers the Palestinian-owned
lands as vacant or unused in order to justify expropriation and
to block Palestinian development and housing. With reference to
the Land Ordinance, Acquisition Public Purposes of 1943, the Israeli
Finance Minister was authorized to issue expropriation orders
for privately owned land if a &quot;public purpose&quot; existed,
which had simply to be defined as such by the Finance Minister.
From 1967 to 1996, some 23,500 dunums have been expropriated from
Palestinians in Jerusalem under this Ordinance.</P>

<P>On 30 July 1980, the Israeli government reaffirmed the 1967
de facto annexation and declared Jerusalem the &quot;eternal undivided
capital&quot; of Israel through its Basic Law on Jerusalem, constituting
a harsh violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention.
The UN Security Council resolution 478 of 20 August 1980 condemned
this declaration by Israel. The resolution declared &quot;that
all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken
by Israel, the occupying power, which have altered or purport
to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem,
and, in particular the recent 'Basic Law' on Jerusalem, are null
and void and must be rescinded forthwith.&quot;</P>

<P>Only about 8% of the total area of East Jerusalem has been
allocated for Palestinian housing needs. In fact, since 1967 no
more than 12% of all new construction projects have been allocated
for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Because of the restrictive
measures concerning Palestinian building, thousands of Palestinian
Jerusalemites live in caves, tents or under inadequate conditions.
The Israeli restrictions on Palestinian building in East Jerusalem
gave the Jerusalemites two options: leave the city or construct
&quot;illegally&quot;, i.e. without getting a licence from the
Jewish Municipality of Jerusalem and thereby becoming subject
to house demolition, which is currently carried out at an average
rate of at least 50 houses per year. Israelis, in comparison,
have a much higher rate of illegal building but do not have to
fear demolition.</P>

<P>The Israeli government conducted a census in July 1967, following
the annexation, which recorded 66,000 Palestinians living within
the new municipal borders of Jerusalem and defining them as &quot;permanent
residents of Israel&quot;. The Jerusalemites who were absent,
for example studying abroad, were considered as non-existent and
had their residency rights revoked. About 50,000 Jerusalemites
lost their right of residency in Jerusalem just because they were
not counted in the Israeli census. Israel also applies a number
of discriminatory bureaucratic methods to control the number of
Palestinians who legally reside in Jerusalem. One of these methods
is the confiscation of ID cards from Palestinian citizens of Jerusalem
under bureaucratic pretexts. The Israeli Interior Ministry has
confiscated more than 4,000 of these cards since 1967.</P>

<P>After more than 30 years of the Israeli occupation of the West
Bank, including East Jerusalem, the future of the Holy City seems
to be completely vague. The Israeli successive governments, both
rightist and leftist, exerted malicious efforts over the last
three decades to change the historic, geographic and demographic
facts of the Occupied Jerusalem with the aim of establishing Israeli
allegations that Jerusalem is a Jewish city.</P>

<P>What seems clear, however, is the weak position of the Palestinian
official leadership, which is, under the current balance of power
the PLO and Israel, expected to make a poor and humiliating performance
in the final status negotiations. Indications to this attitude
were and have been noticed in the Palestinian Authority's response
to the feverish Jewish campaigns to build settlements surrounding
Jerusalem, namely Har Homa settlement on Abu Ghneim Mountain,
and in the heart of the old city of East Jerusalem, namely Ras
Al Amoud, and its response to the construction of a so-called
tourist tunnel under Al Aqsa Holy Mosque in September 1996. Not
even the Palestinian Authority failed to stop these Jewish atrocities
and violations of the Oslo Accords themselves, but the Palestinian
police did very well to suppress the Palestinian uprising and
demonstrations.</P>

<P>In 1996, the Beilin-Abu Mazen draft document-a mocked scenario
for negotiating Jerusalem-was disclosed, allegedly signed back
in September 1995. The Israelis would recognize a sovereign Palestinian
State in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinians would
recognize Israeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem as the capital
of the State of Israel. The Palestinian capital, to be called
Al-Quds (as opposed to Jerusalem!), would be located outside of
the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem in Abu Dees, south of East
Jerusalem, and become an integral part of the Palestinian State.
While Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Haram Al-Sharif
compound and limited autonomy in East Jerusalem, effective sovereignty
over all of Jerusalem would remain in Israel's hands.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Israel and the International Criminal Court</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Dr. Azzam Tamimi</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Israel has a very good reason for opposing the setting up of
an International Criminal Court. According to the statute of the
court, the settlement on land occupied by force is considered
a war crime. Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and those
involved in settlement programmes in the West Bank and Gaza would
thus be liable to prosecution. The use of torture on a wide scale
would be another source of anxiety for the Israelis. Israel is
the only known regime in the world that legalizes the use of torture
during interrogation of suspects, a process that has led to the
death of scores of Palestinians during questioning. Furthermore,
Israel may be held responsible for the mass expulsion of thousands
of Palestinians in 1948 and 1967. Its politicians, present and
past, may also be prosecuted for legalizing the demolition of
homes owned by Palestinians, not only those suspected of &quot;terrorism&quot;
or of aiding &quot;terrorists&quot;, but also of their relatives.
Collective punishment and selective deportation are other charges
that can be made against Israelis who, in addition, frequently
resort to closing the occupied territories and to imposing economic
sanctions on the Palestinians. The 1996 massacre of Lebanese refugees
at Qana in South Lebanon is another example of the atrocities
Israelis have perpetrated in violation of human rights and international
law for which cases may be brought against them. This is, of course,
not to mention the scores of massacres perpetrated against the
Palestinians, the Lebanese and the Egyptians since the creation
of the State of Israel in 1948. The recently disclosed horrific
details of the execution of Egyptian prisoners of war in the Sinai
desert in the aftermath of the 1967 war is another war crime several
Israeli officials may be charged with. In other words, Israel
may deservedly be nominated &quot;war criminal number one&quot;
since the end of the Second World War.</P>

<P>A more recently uncovered Israeli war crime has been the transforming
of the 1967-occupied territories into waste dumps for the Israeli
industry. Some of these waste dumps have created extremely hazardous
living conditions for the Arab population living close to them.
One such example is that of the village of Azzun in the West Bank,
which lies just about 20 kilometres away from a major Israeli
industrial complex. Medical reports point to the discovery of
no less than 20 toxic materials in the waste dump near Azzun.
The rate of cancer cases among villagers has more than doubled
during the past 20 years.</P>

<P>Another war crime committed by the Israelis is the creation
of the collaborators' phenomenon among the Palestinians. Allegedly
prompted by security needs, Israel devised-soon after its occupation
of the rest of Palestine in 1967-a sinister strategy for the recruitment
of collaborators. Enticed with financial rewards and other material
gains, or blackmailed after having been embroiled in immoral acts
(such as sex, drugs or theft), recruited collaborators provide
Israeli intelligence agents with information-not always true-about
suspects. Son has been turned against father, brother against
brother, daughter against mother, cousin against cousin and neighbour
against neighbour, all to the detriment of the Palestinian social
structure and cohesion. Though always looked down upon by the
rest of the population, Israeli military rulers have granted collaborators
extraordinary powers to make them indispensable. A permit of any
kind, or a transaction at any level, would require the intercession
of a collaborator. Only the eruption of the Intifadah in 1987
stripped the collaborators of their acquired social status and
turned them into a despised class of parasites.</P>

<P>One may, in the same light, consider the creation of the Palestinian
Authority (PA) another Israeli war crime. The principal purpose
of the creation of the PA has been to provide Israel with the
security it requires and with the information it greatly needs
in order to keep track of its opponents within the Palestinian
society.</P>

<P>An extension of the collaborators' phenomenon, the PA would
itself be liable for prosecution. In order to fulfil its commitments
as stated in the Oslo peace agreement, the PA has reopened all
the prisons vacated by the Israelis upon their re-deployment.
At least 13 Palestinians have died under interrogation in PA-run
detention centres since 1994 and one or the other of no less than
eight PA security bodies has handed over scores of Palestinian
activists to the Israelis. If one were to add to the above the
dire economic situation created by the peace settlement between
Israel and the PA, Palestinian politicians and security officers
may be as accountable as the Israelis for war crimes against the
Palestinian people.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Five years after Oslo</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Khalid Amayreh</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem (22 July) When the PLO and Israel secretly
concluded the Oslo Agreement more than five years ago, many Palestinians
thought (or were made to think) that what was then termed &quot;an
historical breakthrough&quot; would, at least partially, deliver
them from the shackles of Israeli torment and repression. However,
it is very clear now that the Israeli army, far from ameliorating
its harsh treatment of Palestinians, has actually stepped up its
evil practices against the Palestinian population, especially
those living outside area (A), namely the seven Palestinian towns
administered by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</P>

<P>One of the most evil manifestations of the continuous Israeli
repression is the callous demolition of Palestinian residential
homes. According to human rights organizations, the Israeli army
has destroyed as many as 900 Arab homes in the West Bank since
the establishment of the PA in 1994. In the first half of 1998
alone, Israeli bulldozers pulverized 95 homes, an increase of
100% compared to the number of houses destroyed during the same
period in 1997. Still worse, the occupation authorities have notified
the owners of some 1,800 homes that their shelters would soon
be destroyed.</P>

<P>The occupation authorities routinely justified the evil practice
of home demolition on the grounds that the houses were constructed
illegally, e.g. without their owners obtaining a building license
beforehand.</P>

<P>However, the real reason behind the spate of home destruction
in the West Bank lies in the racist Israeli policy of preventing
or curtailing to the minimum Palestinian demographic expansion.
Needless to say, this sinister policy finds expression in the
long-standing policy of denying Palestinians building licenses
outside the already crowded Palestinian towns and villages. This,
in turn, forces homeless Palestinians, especially young married
couples, to risk building a home, realizing rather well the unlikelihood
of obtaining a building license.</P>

<P>Israeli torment of Palestinians is not confined to home demolition.
The Israeli army routinely carries out nightly raids on Palestinian
homes and institutions, often in full view of powerless PA police.
Palestinian sources point out that Israeli soldiers often beat
up husbands in front of their wives and children before they are
dragged out to a military jeep waiting nearby.</P>

<P>Last week, for example, the Israeli army raided the home of
Ayed Dudin, a 35-year-old Palestinian staff nurse, in the village
of Dahiriya, 15 miles southwest of Hebron. Before the raid, Israeli
soldiers ordered all Palestinian policemen in the area to confine
themselves to their centre until further notice. Dudin was reportedly
beaten up, blindfolded and shackled before being taken away in
an army jeep to a detention camp hundreds of kilometres away.</P>

<P>The same pattern of repression repeats itself throughout the
occupied West Bank, even in areas that are supposed to be under
full Palestinian authority.</P>

<P>Indeed, even Palestinian policemen are arrested by the Israeli
army, which seriously undermines the PA status and stature in
the eyes of the Palestinians.</P>

<P>Earlier this year, the Israeli authorities issued an arrest
warrant for Ghazi al Jabali, General Commander of the Palestinian
police. Refusing to heed the warrant, Jabali was barred from traveling
outside the Gaza Strip for fear of arrest.</P>

<P>For its part, the Palestinian Authority does very little, if
anything, to counter Israeli practices. In fact, the PA often
acts in collusion with Israelis against the Islamist opposition,
arresting its political leaders and raiding its charitable, educational
and health institutions.</P>

<P>For example, PA police detained Dr. Abdul Aziz al Rantisi in
the aftermath of the murder of Hamas fighter Muhieddin al Sharif,
ostensibly by Israeli agents.</P>

<P>When asked last week why Rantisi was still being detained without
trial, Ghazi al Jabali said, &quot;Rantisi is an administrative
detainee.&quot;</P>

<P>The Israeli occupation authorities have used administrative
detention since 1967 mainly to silence and punish political activists
and public opinion leaders who dare speak out against the occupation.</P>

<P>However, using the same method of repression by the PA against
its own people is viewed gravely by most Palestinians, who have
come to view the PA as &quot;just another expression of the Israeli
occupation.&quot;</P>

<P>This, coupled with political powerlessness, nepotism and rampant
corruption permeating throughout the PA, has caused most Palestinians
to withdraw their support from the PA.</P>

<P>PA Chairman Yasser Arafat is aware of the widening gap between
his government and the Palestinian masses. Hence, he announced
plans for a government reshuffle.</P>

<P>However, most Palestinians don't seem to give Arafat the benefit
of the doubt this time, which suggests that any reshuffle at this
time will only be viewed as too little, too late.<BR>

Jerusalem, a City Under Siege</CENTER></H3>

<H3><CENTER><U><SMALL>By Ruth Anderson</SMALL></U></CENTER></H3>

<P>&quot;Zionism is the most stupendous fallacy in Jewish history...I
speak as a Jew.&quot; Henry J. Morgenthau</P>

<P>The philosophy embodied in Zionism is to make Jewish the land
that belongs to the Palestinians. The most important method of
Judaizing Jerusalem as well as the remnants of the West Bank and
Gaza, is the possession of Palestinian land. Such possession is
often accomplished by Jewish settlements. The result is massive
losses of Palestinian land and the displacement of its original
inhabitants. The Judaization of Palestinian land is a central
tenet and practice of Zionism.</P>

<P>It is ironic that though the Jews were allowed to return to
Jerusalem when Saladin, the Muslim conqueror retook the city after
the Christian Crusaders had burned them in their synagogue, today,
Palestinians who have lived in the old city for countless generations
are being evicted from their own homes and property. As long as
Jerusalem had been under Muslim control, Christians and Jews were
free to practice their own religion as they pleased.</P>

<P>Israelis are making every effort to &quot;resettle&quot; the
city and apartment blocks pop up on every hillside around Jerusalem,
creating a ring around it. The demolition of Palestinian homes
to make way for Israeli building programs is nothing new. The
encirclement of Jerusalem by Jewish neighborhoods has turned the
Old City into a Ghetto and the Westernized Zionist urbanization
of Jerusalem has detracted from its historic and religious heritage.
The Palestinian inhabitants of the so-called &quot;unified&quot;
city have become nothing more than second-class citizens.</P>

<P>It is not uncommon to see Israeli bulldozers destroy Palestinian
homes as in the occupied Arab East Jerusalem section of Silwan.
On July 14, 1998, Sabri Karameh said his recently-completed one-story
home was destroyed without warning. Around 15 Jewish settler families
live in several homes in the neighborhood they call the &quot;&quot;City
of David.&quot;</P>

<P>In another incident, a Palestinian family is due to be expelled
from an apartment building that it has occupied for three decades
by 28 members of the Palestinian Gazlan family. One of the family
members, Riyad Gazlan, said there are documents proving ownership
of the building. He further stated, &quot;For 20 years Jewish
organizations have been trying to buy the building and the land.
They have already offered up to two million dollars but we have
refused.&quot;</P>

<P>Last year, Israel launched a project that involves annexing
several Jewish townships to the west of the city to boost the
city's population by another 30,000 Jews. Palestinian President,
Yassar Arafat, has been pushing for an Arab summit of Islamic
foreign ministers in a bid to roll back Israel's plans for a &quot;Greater
Jerusalem.&quot; He said, &quot;The aim of this Israeli government
is to stop implementing the (peace) agreement and annex the whole
city of occupied Jerusalem and to Judaize the whole city.&quot;</P>

<P>Under a new and controversial Israeli plan to expand Jerusalem's
municipal authority, several Jewish settlements themselves voiced
opposition on the premise that they wanted to maintain independent
control of their own communities.</P>

<P>This new plan called &quot;the Umbrella Plan&quot; would bring
several settlements and suburbs ringing the city under Jerusalem's
jurisdiction for matters such as planning and building. The plan
outraged Palestinians who charged it violated fragile Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords by altering the city's demographics and making settlements
on occupied land appear to be part of Jerusalem. Israel has acknowledged
that the plan aims to increase the city's Jewish population.</P>

<P>Zionism was and still is a political ideology to establish
a Jewish state and to &quot;ingather&quot; all Jews into this
state and to make Jerusalem its &quot;eternal&quot; capital.</P>

<P>The indigenous Arab inhabitants of Jerusalem are a people under
siege in a city where once Jews, Christians and Muslims were free
to live and worship. The Holy city of Arabs and Muslims suffers
the occupation and colonization of a ruthless regime bent on destroying
its Arab and Muslim heritage. Palestinians helplessly suffer as
they are evicted from their homes or watch their houses bulldozed
by the Israeli authority who are determined to impose a new status
quo. Will Arab East Jerusalem ever become the capital of the dwindling
remains of Palestine and will the somnolent lazy Arab and Muslim
world ever wake up to the reality of their holy city under siege?</P>

<P>At the very least, the city, holy to the three monotheistic
faiths, should be governed under a special international regime
and be administered by the United Nations.<BR>
<BR>
There can only be peace when two conflicting parties agree to
negotiate but as long as Israel is encouraged to do whatever it
wishes, there will be no compromise and Jerusalem will remain
a city under siege.</P>

<P>One can only hope and pray that one day Arabs and Muslims will
be as interested in the fate of occupied Jerusalem and Palestine
as they were in the winner of the World Cup.<BR>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Naji Alloush</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>From the Palestinian Authority (PA) to the Egyptian Government,
and from the French Government to the Russian Government, the
alleged crisis of the &quot;peace process&quot; seems to have
become the topic of the hour. But does it mean that mere talk
can make such a crisis real?</P>

<P>To answer this question, we probably should look first at those
who are agonizing the most over this supposed crisis, namely some
Arab regimes and the leadership of the PLO. In the early 1990s,
congenial circumstances within the region led to the proposed
resolution of the Arab-Zionist conflict on the basis of recognizing
&quot;Israel's&quot; right to exist within the borders of the
land occupied in 1948 in exchange for some form of a Palestinian
entity in (and not necessarily all of) the West Bank and Gaza.</P>

<P>This official Arab trend was counting on this conclusion based
on the following three overarching assumptions:</P>

<P>1. That there is an international front led by the U.S. Government
that supports the establishment of &quot;peace&quot; between the
Arab Governments and &quot;Israel&quot;. And now, after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the U.S. Government, the leading superpower,
has got what it takes to overcome both Arab and Zionist obstacles
to such &quot;peace&quot;.</P>

<P>2. That an official Arab consensus, including and especially
from the leadership of the PLO, to recognize &quot;Israel&quot;
would set Zionists internationally in the political corner, and
thus force them to drop any reservations about accepting such
&quot;peace&quot;. This would be additionally true because the
&quot;peace&quot; package offered to Zionists does not only include
recognition, but also includes opening up Arab hearts, markets
and resources to our brothers and sisters from Abraham.</P>

<P>3. That the Arab regimes that participated in operation &quot;Desert
Storm&quot; and the siege on Iraq had all agreed to accept peace
under the principle of &quot;Land for Peace&quot;. That position
and the particular record of those taking it should be enough
to support U.S. efforts and to allay Zionist fears.</P>

<P>However, as time and events later unfolded, it became increasingly
obvious that those Arab regimes and Palestinian groups that na&iuml;vely
adopted anything similar to the three assumptions mentioned above
have regally misjudged three elements of the situation. Those
being:</P>

<P>1. The Reality of the U.S. Government's Role. The U.S. Government
is a party to the conflict, not a mediator. Its understanding
of the nature of the &quot;peace process&quot; is essentially
THE SAME as that of Zionists. Verbally, the U.S. Government advocates
the formula of &quot;land for peace&quot;. Practically, its policy
revolves around (a) enforcing the recognition of &quot;Israel&quot;,
(b) catering to &quot;Israeli&quot; interests and security obsessions,
and (c) securing all the necessary Arab and Palestinian concessions
to make &quot;Israel&quot; feel safe.</P>

<P>Thus the U.S. Government in this sense does not simply restrict
itself to recognizing &quot;Israel's&quot; right to exist, but
actively pursues the implementation of two concomitant strategies:
(a) refurbishing &quot;Israel&quot; with all the elements of strength,
and (b) extricating every possible element of strength from the
hands of the Arabs, and even Muslims.</P>

<P>For example, the strategic partnership between the U.S. Government
and &quot;Israel&quot; GREW after the Gulf war. Military aid increased
both in quality and quantity. On the other hand, pressure on Iraq
to eliminate its sources of strength increased. Pressure on Iran
is increasing, and so is pressure on Syria and Egypt.</P>

<P>Evidently, these overt U.S. policies serve directly to consolidate
Zionist political gains and to weaken the Arab position. In spite
of that, we still encounter some Arab officials who say that they
are counting on the U.S. Government to salvage the &quot;peace
process&quot;!</P>

<P>2. Misjudging the Zionist Position. The Governments of Rabin,
Perez and Netanyahu, like the previous Governments of Ben Gurion,
Eshkol, Golda Meir and Begin, never for a second cut out the rhetoric
about peace. They entered ALL their wars under the political cover
of peace slogans. But what kind of peace was that? The one kind
that may have different expressions. It is the kind that Yigal
Ellon or Perez suggested in the form of a &quot;New Middle East&quot;.
It is the kind that guarantees colonialization without limits,
possessing the elements of strength without limits, and conquering
the Arab world economically and politically with the tools of
violence or &quot;peace&quot;. That is Zionist peace!</P>

<P>3. Misjudging the Arab Position. When some Arab regimes got
carried away in the &quot;peace process&quot; without any real
understanding of the U.S. or Zionist position, they also lacked
an Arab position ON THE GROUND that would guarantee peace.</P>

<P>Realistically speaking, ANY peace, even if its ultimate ambition
was only the implementation of United Nations resolutions 242
and 338, REQUIRES:</P>

<P>(a) The existence of a total Arab resistance INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
Palestine that would be even more advanced than all forms of Palestinian
resistance between 1965 and 1998, including the so-called &quot;suicide&quot;
operations;</P>

<P>(b) The existence of Arab armies READY to do battle on every
front, and the preparation for a people's war MORE massive and
more protracted than the Vietnamese;</P>

<P>(c) The existence of a UNITED Arab political position, which
nevertheless does not bow before Zionist blackmail and U.S. Government
pressures.</P>

<P>As long as these strategic considerations have not been taken
into account, as long as the PLO has dropped its weapons and the
Arab Governments concerned with the so-called &quot;peace process&quot;
DID NOT PREPARE FOR IT, and as long as these Arab Governments
rely instead on U.S. Government goodwill and Zionist rhetoric,
what goes down on the ground won't be the &quot;peace process&quot;
that the Arab regimes are talking about, BUT RATHER THE &quot;PEACE
PROCESS&quot; THAT THE OTHER SIDE IS TALKING ABOUT.</P>

<P>And what about the other side--the U.S. Government and &quot;Israel&quot;?
THEIR &quot;PEACE PROCESS&quot; IS NOT IN ANY CRISIS. In fact,
we have saved the other side from its crisis by conceding everything
that could possibly lead to it.</P>

<P>The Alleged Crisis is Part of the Show. Therefore, the other
side, the U.S.-Zionist side, IS NOT IN A CRISIS AND NEITHER IS
ITS &quot;PEACE PROCESS&quot;. On the contrary, the other side
has achieved more in our region since the Gulf War than it has
since the Second World War. So much so that perhaps a decade or
so may be needed to absorb it all.</P>

<P>So the present crisis is only that of the official Arab side,
which wants a little more out of the &quot;peace process&quot;
without trying to possess those elements of power that improve
the conditions of its participation. In the meantime, the U.S.-Zionist
side enforces military, economic, and political conditions, coercing
the Arab Governments to march on exactly as planned. Eventually,
neither those Arabs calling for peace do what it takes to accomplish
that peace, nor those Arabs calling for war do what it takes to
make that option feasible. Consequently, the crisis of the Arab
regimes in the &quot;peace process&quot; translates into more
Zionist successes at the expense of the Arab and Palestinian people
until direct political action on their part allows these temporary
successes to be reversed.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>On Rapacity, Politics and the PA</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Diana Mardi</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>The question of East Jerusalem has finally been solved! Palestinians
under autonomous rule were astonished to discover this recently
when they received phone bills from their brand new &quot;national&quot;
communications company, Pal-Tel. Any calls to Jerusalem, whether
East or West, appear as &quot;made from the autonomy area to Israel.&quot;
They carry a special high rate. Bills have skyrocketed. All this
is the product of an agreement signed recently by the Israeli
telephone company, Bezek, and Pal-Tel. Once again, the economic
symbols of nationhood are proving to be gold mines for the ruling
elite.</P>

<P>Previously, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza were connected
directly to Bezek. They didn't lick honey; they had to wait for
up to seven years for a line, and when finally they got one, the
quality was bad. During the intifadah, Israel published Decree
No. 1279, which forbade the use of faxes and electronic mail.
Israel had full control over the lines. A call from one Gazan
town to another, for example, had to pass through Big Brother
in Ashkelon.</P>

<P>Recently, communications switched hands-at least in part. Pal-Tel
received the right to be the chief communications company in the
Territories, but it signed an understanding with Bezek for certain
&quot;services.&quot; Dani Rosen of Israel's Ministry of Communications
says that his office reached a draft agreement two years ago with
Pal-Tel, and recently it was approved with modifications. &quot;The
contract is in accordance with the Cairo Agreement, which instructs
us to hand the PA 22 civil authorities, among them communications&quot;
(interview, 15 June 1998).</P>

<P>What is the nature of the new agreement between Pal-Tel and
Bezek? According to Roni Mandelbaum of Bezek, from now on Pal-Tel
is in charge of all telephone communications in the autonomous
area. They are responsible for the functioning of the operators,
meter readings and the pricing of calls. Roles have switched,
and now Bezek has become a &quot;subcontractor&quot; of Pal-Tel.
It prints the bills for the latter through its own computer system
according to the information that Pal-Tel gives it (the breakdown
of the bill, Palestinians complain, is in Hebrew).</P>

<P>Dani Rosen emphasizes that Pal-Tel will not be permitted to
connect its clients abroad. This must be done through an Israeli
company. Pal-Tel will make these connections, he added, through
two companies, but he refused to say which ones.</P>

<P>Not only were the bees busy in the spring of 1998, but also
Pal-Tel's operators were working to full capacity. The charge
for installing a new telephone rose from the Bezek price of NIS
580 to NIS 800. Palestinian customers received bills 21 times
higher then they had under Israeli control.</P>

<P>Pal-Tel has a major interest in monopolizing international
calls. Although he avoided mentioning his own collaboration with
Bezek, Pal-Tel's chief manager in Nablus, Walid Irshid, complained
to this reporter that Palestinians are using Israeli companies
to call abroad. &quot;We, as a company, have decided to put an
end to it. We have demanded that Bezek cut any possibilities for
Palestinians to call abroad through firms other than ours.&quot;</P>

<P>During the initial stages of economic development, utility
services such as electricity, water and communications are usually
owned by the State and protected from competition. Although Pal-Tel
is a private commercial company, the Palestinian Authority has
given it the communications monopoly. It should come as no surprise
that its chief, and one its main shareholders, is Khalid Salam,
also known as Muhammad Rashid. We have mentioned him before: he
is Yasser Arafat's economic adviser and a co-signatory on Arafat's
once secret bank account in Tel Aviv.</P>

<P>At present there is no body, governmental or otherwise, to
monitor Pal-Tel's monopoly and protect the people from its sheer
greed. The Palestinian Ministry of Communications is careful not
to criticize or interfere in its decisions.</P>

<P>Upon first receiving their enormous new bills, Palestinians
didn't sit idly by. Al Wattan, an independent cable TV station
in Ramallah, received hundreds of complaints. One man reported
that he had been billed NIS 15,000 ($4,166) for the installation
of a new line.</P>

<P>Pal-Tel's commercial greed suits Israeli expansionism. Dani
Rosen is very pleased that even Pal-Tel recognizes East Jerusalem
as &quot;Israel&quot;. The arrangement with Bezek also feeds Israel's
&quot;security&quot; needs. If Bezek prepares the breakdown of
bills, it can easily get all the telephone data on &quot;Hamas
leader&quot; Sheikh Yassin, for example, or Yasser Arafat himself.</P>

<P>For the private citizen, the agreement between Pal-Tel and
Bezek (both have refused to disclose details) highlights the disparity
between independence in style and dependence in reality. Because
the Occupied Territories have not been economically liberated,
most business is still done with Israel.</P>

<P>Dani Rosen believes that if Pal-Tel goes berserk in its pricing,
Palestinians will simply buy an Israeli mobile phone, once again
enriching the Israeli economy. But what if Pal-Tel signs an agreement
with the mobile companies too? Might we one day see the impossible
boycott: a telephone boycott of Pal-Tel-a telephone Intifadah?</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Jerusalem under threat:<BR>
Israel pushes the region to the brink</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Dr. Daud A. Abdullah*</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>With the recent visit by American House Speaker Newt Gingrich
to Jerusalem, Israel's right wing regime may have, at last, scored
some rare diplomatic points to enthuse its influential religious
constituency. To the Palestinians, however, the controversial
visit has left in its trail a familiar air of denial, loss, and
national tragedy. Despite Washington's efforts to emphasize the
&quot;unofficial&quot; nature of Mr. Gingrich's tour, regional
analysts are equally keen to point out that it came less than
three months after the mission of Britain's Foreign Minister Robin
Cook to Jerusalem. No other two high-profile events could have
contrasted more glaringly both in their nature and purpose. For
whereas Cook in his characteristic no-nonsense style recognized
the Palestinians' right to Jerusalem during his visit, Gingrich
on the other hand upheld Israel's exclusive claim to the city
by laying a symbolic foundation stone for a new US Embassy on
the site of a former British military camp in the Talibiya district.</P>

<P>There were, in addition, other important differences between
the two visits which must not be overlooked. Far from undertaking
a personal, party, or even national initiative, Foreign Secretary
Cook was conducting an official assignment on behalf of the European
Union of which the UK was then President. Contrarily, White House
disclosures confirmed that, the House of Representatives Speaker,
Gingrich, was himself acting only in a personal capacity with
no national, regional, or international mandate. Despite the massive
media smoke screen released by Washington, it all seemed insufficient
to cover up American pretense and motives.</P>

<P>One need only recall here that soon after assuming office,
Newt Gingrich went on record to proclaim: &quot;I strongly favor
moving the American Embassy. I think it is absurd for us to single
out Israel as a country where we define what we think the capital
should be. It's the right of Israel to define its capital, and
we as an ally should in fact be responsive.&quot;1 A few months
thereafter (9 May 1995), he submitted a bill to Congress urging
the administration to begin work on the new embassy site in Jerusalem
before the end of 1996 and to formally open it by 31 May 1999
or face a penalty of cuts in State Department construction funds
for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 fiscal years.2</P>

<P>Judging from Mr. Cook's well-known comments on the ethical
dimensions of foreign relations and the primacy of international
law, his petulant confrontation with the Jewish extremists in
Jerusalem was not at all surprising. And, in like manner, the
subsequent cries of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; were also equally
predictable. None of these reactions did, however, conceal the
basic fact that Israel's occupation of both west and east Jerusalem
is in clear violation of scores of UN resolutions starting with
No.181 of 1947. Given its notorious uncritical support for Israel,
the current US administration has since Oslo campaigned for the
cancellation of 50 years of UN resolutions on Palestinian rights.
Notwithstanding, the European Union Heads of State had themselves
clearly explained their position at the Amsterdam summit nine
months before Robin Cook undertook his mission to Jerusalem. That
is; &quot;the non-acceptability of the annexation of territory
by force&quot; and recognition of &quot;the legitimate aspiration
of the Palestinian people to decide their own future.&quot; Against
this backdrop, therefore, the Cook and Gingrich visits to Jerusalem
highlighted what appears to be two divergent approaches to Middle
East peace and international law.</P>

<P>Apart from Jerusalem, Europe's inclination to honor its international
obligations and America's contempt for them have been illustrated
in several other ways. While the latter has steadfastly refused
to pay its huge arrears to the United Nations, the European states
have quietly shouldered their share of dues to the international
organization. As a trading block, recent studies confirm that
Europe conducts far more trade with Israel than does the United
States.3 And, even while doing so, individual countries like Britain
have in fact gone a step further by increasing their aid to the
United Nations Relief and Welfare Agency (UNRWA) in order maintain
its services to the Palestinian refugees. On its part, the United
States has, for whatever reasons, been consistently at the forefront
of efforts to dismantle the 50 year old relief organization.</P>

<P><B>Ethnic cleansing without genocide</B><BR>
For all its worth, Europe's approach to peace in the Middle East
has been gravely hampered by its own reluctance to search for
an alternative to the Oslo process. While the Israelis have, time
and again, insisted that there is nothing sacrosanct about the
various accords, all the involved parties particularly the Palestinians
have been obliged to strictly comply with them. Their announcement
of the so-called Basic Law on 30 July 1980 claiming Jerusalem
as their capital was universally condemned as a gross violation
of international law. Hence, the following month, the Security
Council denounced the Israeli move in resolution 478 &quot;Deciding
not to recognize the &quot;Basic Law&quot; on Jerusalem and such
other actions by Israel that sought to alter the character and
status of the city and calling on states to withdraw diplomatic
missions from Jerusalem.&quot;</P>

<P>More recently, following Baruch Goldstein's massacre of Muslim
worshippers in Hebron, the Council adopted resolution 904 in March
1994 &quot;Reaffirming its relevant resolutions, which affirmed
the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August
1949 to the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967, including
Jerusalem, and the Israeli responsibilities thereunder.&quot;
But even after the promotion of numerous Arab, Israeli and international
formula to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, none have specifically
addressed the question of Jerusalem; despite the generally accepted
view that without its resolution there can be no peace in the
region. The process inaugurated by the 1991 Madrid conference
is no exception as this was initially reflected in Israel's vehement
opposition to the presence of east Jerusalemites in the joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.</P>

<P>Seven years after the so-called New Middle East was established,
the Israelis continue in their relentless campaign to Judaize
Jerusalem through land confiscation, settlement expansion, and
the &quot;quiet ethnic cleansing&quot; of the city of its Arab
population. They have, indeed, invented new political terms to
underscore and flaunt their annexation of Jerusalem. The 1980s
slogan of the &quot;united and eternal capital&quot; has accordingly
given way to &quot;greater Jerusalem&quot; in the late 1990s.
Today, the latter includes Ghush 'Ustiyun between Bethlehem and
Hebron in the south to Adumeem in the north. In its drive to realize
this enlarged Jerusalem, Israel has, since the 1993 Oslo accords
seized 26,382 feddans of Palestinian land under the pretext of
closed military areas, 4,295 for settlement expansion, 2,984 for
the opening up of roads leading to the settlements, and another
2,950 feddans for what has been termed natural preserves.4 As
a result, 79% of this newly expanded Jerusalem is now under Israeli
control.</P>

<P>Still further, in an effort to strengthen its grip on the city
and improve its negotiating position, the Netanyaho regime has
announced its intention to reduce and limit the number of Palestinians
in Jerusalem to 30%. The enforcement of this policy will, inevitably,
prove to be a major test for the United Nations, European Union,
and Nato Alliance. Given their declared willingness to employ
force against Serbia for its &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of the
Albanians in Kosovo, Palestinians are naturally demanding a similar
evenhanded approach to Israel's ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem,
even if it is not accompanied by genocide. Indeed, the case for
immediate and decisive action becomes all the more imperative
because Jerusalem is still regarded as occupied territory in international
law.</P>

<P><B>Containing the aggressor</B><BR>
In retrospect, history has shown that the European society which
today views Israel as a natural extension of itself was until
the earlier part of this century totally unprepared to coexist
with their Jewish minorities. On account of this, the latter became
the victims of widespread persecution in order to force their
&quot;return to the promised land.&quot; After decades of western
diplomatic and military support, they have been transformed from
a closed minority in Europe into an advanced military and nuclear
power in the heart of the Arab world. That being the case, the
Europeans should actually be the first to recognize that stability
comes not from the building of conventional arsenals nor the acquisition
of weapons of mass destruction but rather from the guarantee and
respect of human and national rights. For even after its massive
stock pile of weapons in 1939, the European system was, nevertheless,
thrown into havoc and mayhem by a few undemocratic regimes intent
on territorial expansion.</P>

<P>Because of its foreign and colonialist nature, the Israeli
project in Palestine has, after all, remained the main source
of tension and instability in the region. The failure of consecutive
mediation efforts throughout the last 50 years have been caused
by their inability to reconcile the irreconcilable. That being
Israel's dogged pursuit of territorial expansion and regional
dominance with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians
for freedom and independence in their native land.</P>

<P>Israel's current &quot;provocative&quot; policies in Jerusalem
has fully revived world interest in the other explosive issues
simmering under the ruins of the Oslo process. The problem of
the Palestinian refugees in neighboring Arab countries constitutes
a deadly can of worms which all the negotiating parties, including
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would very much prefer
to escape from. The denial of their national identity and political
rights will, of course, continue to be a principal source of instability
and turmoil in the region. Already, the hot and cold &quot;security
cooperation&quot; between the PNA and the Israeli occupiers has
eminently increased the likelihood of confrontation between the
former and its opposition especially the Islamist forces who seem
irrevocably committed to a strategy of armed resistance.</P>

<P>Finally, the growing political influence of Israel&uacute;s
religious extremists should, in the presence of Arab weakness
and official Palestinian ineptitude, also be a cause of international
concern. The onus definitely is upon the world community to take
whatever measures are needed to restrain the Zionist state from
using its military advantage to impose its political hegemony
and limit the freedom of the Arab nation. While the governments
of the region may act otherwise, their gallant people have long
discovered that the real aim of Oslo is to install a status quo
upon them which is not only alien to their ethnic and religious
identity but also opposed to their security interests and national
aspirations. The popular Palestinian uprising which erupted in
Jerusalem and the West Bank in October 1996 after Israel opened
its &quot;archaeological tunnel&quot; was a timely reminder of
the sacrifices which they are prepared to make in defence of their
religious sanctuaries and heritage. On that occasion 90 Palestinians
made the ultimate sacrifice and over 1,000 were wounded in battles
with the Israeli occupationists. For the sake of regional peace
and stability, therefore, Jerusalem demands an alternative to
the now discredited Oslo process.</P>

<P>I was as much offended, as a Christian, by the postings of
a Personal Home Page Web Site on America OnLine, the world's largest
online provider, called Suralikeit.</P>

<P>The site was set up ostensibly to fool people into believing
it was a source of Qur'anic verses. The owner was obviously an
imbecile intent on antagonizing and slandering Muslims, based
on translations of some of the site's garbage.</P>

<P>Interestingly, AOL received enough complaints from subscribers
to its service that it ordered the &quot;personal home web page&quot;
shut down, although the owner is now free to find a new home for
his or her filth.</P>

<P>That was a major victory, although I noticed it even engaged
the protests of a source as esteemed as Al-Azhar University scholars.</P>

<P>I picked up the newspaper recently and read the following,
and I have to wonder: How often does this assault against Arabs
occur and go unchallenged?</P>

<P><B>From the Chicago Tribune (26 June 1998):</B></P>

<P>&quot;Jeddah, Saudi Arabia -- In the early days, this Kingdom's
highest religious authorities were vehemently opposed to the introduction
of radio. So certain were they that this new machine was the work
of the devil that they staged a surprise raid on the palace radio
station in hopes of catching the actual devil on the job.&quot;</P>

<P>This story was written by the Tribune's Foreign Correspondent
Reporter, Tom Hundley.</P>

<P>And then, there was this one, published the very same day in
a gossip column that is widely circulated by the Chicago Sun-Times,
called &quot;Kup's Column&quot; (26 June 1998):</P>

<P>&quot;Also from Israel: Marilyn Miglin, spirit of Oak Street,
home of her unique boutique, is visiting the Shaare Zadek hospital,
which conducted a tour of the nation. In Bethlehem, the tour included
a visit to a typical Arab marketplace, where one of the traders,
obviously captivated by her appearance, offered 40 camels in exchange
for her. But the offer was promptly turned down because where
would someone keep 40 camels in Chicago?&quot;</P>

<P>Interestingly enough, Kup (Irv Kupcinet), included the subtle
falsehood that Bethlehem is part of the &quot;Israel Nation.&quot;<BR>
What do you do about garbage writing like these examples?</P>

<P>While one was written by an alleged &quot;foreign correspondent,&quot;
and the other by a gossip columnist, the impact of both is the
same--to feed the negative stereotypes against Arabs that were
built up from the beginning by the very same media.</P>

<P>It's not just a matter of the writers being Jewish. Kup is.
I don't believe Hundley is. But, I do believe they are both as
equally biased and as destructive as the other is.</P>

<P>And that is an important distinction we must always make: Being
Jewish is not the issue and should not be.</P>

<P>Part of the problem is the Arabs and the Arab countries themselves.</P>

<P>We gladly rise to our emotions to protest the AOL web site,
but probably don't even bother to address the dangers of the stereotypes
I cited above from the Tribune and the Sun-Times.</P>

<P>The stories from Hundley and Kup are more damaging than the
Suralikeit Web site for the simple reason that the stories of
the reporters are believable. The garbage on the Suralikeit site
was not.</P>

<P>On the one hand, Arab countries crack down, punish and censor
their own media. On the other hand, they allow Western news reporters
like Tom Hundley to come to their countries and write what they
want.</P>

<P>Instead of cracking down on Arab writers, the Arab countries
should encourage real journalism and allow open discussions.</P>

<P>They should also put their foot down on foreign journalists
who try to come into their countries because for all the so-called
good the Western Media is supposed to bring to protecting the
civil rights movement there, the Middle East continues to take
a beating from Western Journalists whose stories may address real
issues, but that are also filled with negative and often hateful
images, such as the one I am sure was falsely reported in Kup's
column.</P>

<P>What might cracking down on the Western media do? Well, for
starters, it might force the Western media to hire Arab reporters.
Ethnicity is important to the way a story is covered. We see it
all the time in so-called objective reports filled with falsehoods
reflecting the personal biases of the writers themselves.</P>

<P>It would be wrong to think that as Arabs we can influence Western
Media like the Chicago Tribune or the Sun-Times in the same manner
that we did the Internet provider, America OnLine.</P>

<P>You have to look upon America OnLine as a multinational corporation,
with business interests all over the world.</P>

<P>Complaints from Arabs certainly might influence their bottom-line,
so they will respond.</P>

<P>But complaints from Arabs to the Tribune and the Sun-Times
usually go unanswered and are ignored.</P>

<P>The Sun-Times is owned by the same company that also owns the
Jerusalem Post. Frequently, the Sun-Times re-publishes one-sided,
anti-Arab columns from Jerusalem Post writers--columns filled
with bias, hatred, and false stereotypes.</P>

<P>You see, the Western News Media is not in the business of providing
the truth.</P>

<P>The Western News Media is in the business of providing &quot;their
truth.&quot;</P>

<P>And &quot;their truth&quot; is often very different from the
reality.</P>

the labyrinth would be simplified. Especially if the famous weapon
of anti-Semitism is used against anybody who dares to stand against
Israeli policies. Many of the meetings to discuss these Israeli
issues are open to the public and certainly at least one AIPAC
representative would be present. Congressman Paul McClusky (California),
after returning from a trip to the Middle East and saw on the
field the illegal building of so many settlements on the West
Bank, asked to reduce aid to Israel by $150 million, which is
the amount spent by Israel on settlements. He was shocked at the
immediate organized campaign against him. He thought he was acting
within the declared policy of the U.S. of considering the settlements
as illegal and that posed a threat to peace. He received thousands
of telegrams from all over but more from his State of California,
condemning his position and calling him all kinds of names, including
anti-Semitic. This racial slur has been used quite extensively
by the Zionists against anybody who criticizes Israel, and it
has been quite effective, as it has worked miracles for Israel.
The staged reactions of thousands of telegrams and telephone calls
opposing certain policies do not represent the reaction of the
American public or the actual constituents of the representative,
but it is usually the work of the organized Zionist groups across
the nation and with the direct instructions of AIPAC under the
Action Alert programme! These tactics had been used and succeeded
in blocking the re-election of Ex-Senator Charles Percy of Illinois,
J. William Fullbright of Idaho and the tarnishing of the reputations
of civil leaders like Rev. Jesse Jackson and a few others. Ex-Senator
Fullbright chaired the investigations into the tax-exempt status
for any donations to Israel and the massive funding channeled
illegally into the American Zionist Council by Israel. More than
$5 million were poured into the Council for spending on public
relations and Zionist propaganda. Of course he was labeled anti-Semitic
and an enemy of Israel and failed to get re-elected. Fullbright
said the United States failed to pressure Israel for a negotiated
settlement, because the great majority of the Senate of the U.S.,
somewhere around 80%, are completely in support of Israel and
anything Israel wants. This has been demonstrated time and time
again, and this has made it difficult for the U.S Government to
run its foreign policy. &quot;Israel controls the Senate,&quot;
he explained to the public during an appearance on the &quot;Face
the Nation&quot; TV programme. Fullbright saw little hope that
Capitol Hill will effectively challenge the Israeli lobby, because
it would be political suicide to oppose them unless someone would
have the courage of Eisenhower, who opposed them in 1956. Mr.
Morris Amitay, a former executive director of AIPAC, said that
any legislation important to Israel starts with a consistent,
reliable and pre-committed base of 200 supporting Congressmen
out of the 435 as well as 40-45 out of the 100 Senators! And that
their job as lobbyists would be to solicit those who are outside
this base, which is not a difficult job to do! The Washington
Post described the Israeli lobby as similar to the tobacco or
the gun control lobbies except that they cannot criticize the
Israeli lobby as we do with the others! Mr. Ari Shavit, an Israeli
columnist, reflected sorrowfully on the death of over 100 civilians
at Qana in south of Lebanon by the Israelis saying, &quot;We killed
them because the lives of the others do not count as much as our
own, and we do not have to account for it.&quot; He rationalized
that Israeli arrogance was due to the Jewish control, which has
the White House, the Senate and the media in its hands! <BR>
In 1975 AIPAC sponsored a letter under the Spirit of '76 sent
to President Gerald Ford with 76 signatures demanding that the
President should reiterate the U.S. position of commitment to
Israeli security by a policy of continued military supplies and
diplomatic and economic support. Such a statement would not have
caused any ripples had it not been for the demand that it should
be made public. This shocked the executive branch that retaliated
by declaring a new approach of reappraisal regarding the U.S.
policy in the Middle East. This meant that aid for Israel could
be curtailed, what else could &quot;appraisal&quot; mean? Israel's
immediate response came from the Senate itself, as Jerusalem activated
its lobby in the U.S., which in turn signed up three fourths of
the members of the Senate in support of Israel's position! The
letter was a demonstration of impressive clout, crafted and circulated
by AIPAC; it had been endorsed overnight by the majority of the
Senate membership. Several Senators, who at first said &quot;no&quot;,
quickly changed their positions. Senator John Culver admitted
candidly, &quot;The pressure was too great. I caved.&quot; So
did President Ford. He backed down and never again challenged
the lobby. On 7 July 1987, as reported by the Palm Beach Post,
the Reagan Administration notified the Congress on 29 May 1987
of its intention to sell Maverick missiles to its close ally Saudi
Arabia. Within one hour, AIPAC started its campaign to foil the
sale to the detriment of the national interests. In less than
10 days, 260 members of the Congress co-sponsored a resolution
to block the sale. President Reagan withdrew his request! According
to the same source in Washington, President Bush tried to put
some pressure on Israel to join the Madrid Peace Conference on
the Middle East, by declaring that the $10 billion guarantee for
Israeli loans would be forthcoming as soon as Israel joins the
peace process. All hell broke loose as the pro-Israel AIPAC used
Action Alert to put pressure on the White House to retract this
position, so much so that President Bush appealed to the American
public support against AIPAC. After President Bush asked that
Israel should be sanctioned for selling ballistic missiles to
South Africa, in violation of American laws, he retracted his
position when AIPAC used its influence under Action Alert! The
sanctions were waived in October 1991 and so American Law genuflects
in front of Israel!<BR>
Admiral Thomas Moorer recalls a dramatic example of Israeli lobby
power from his days as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
At the time of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Mordechai Gur, the defense
attach&eacute; at the Israeli embassy who later became Commander-in-Chief
of Israeli forces, came to Moorer demanding that the U.S. provide
Israel with aircraft equipped with a high technology air-to-surface
anti-tank missile called the Maverick. At the time, the U.S. had
only one squadron so equipped. Moorer recalls telling Gur, &quot;I
can't let you have those aircraft. We have just one squadron.
Besides, we've been testifying before the Congress convincing
them of how much we needed this equipment. If we gave you our
only squadron, Congress would raise hell with us.&quot; What was
Gur's reply? He said, &quot;You get us the airplanes; I'll take
care of the Congress.&quot; Moorer paused, then adds, &quot;And
he did.&quot; America's only squadron equipped with Mavericks
went to Israel!<BR>
I have never seen a President-I don't care who he is-stand up
to them (the Israelis). It just boggles your mind. They always
get what they want. The Israelis know what is going on all the
time. I got to the point where I wasn't writing anything down
anymore; they would know everything before any other official.
If the American people understood what a grip those people have
got on our Government, they would rise in arms. Our citizens don't
have any idea what goes on. During the 1973 war, the Israelis
asked for ammunitions for the 90 millimetre guns, which we sent
earlier. The Pentagon made a search and found none. Thomas Pianka,
an officer then serving at the Pentagon with the International
Security Agency, recalls, &quot;We made an honest effort to find
the ammunition. We checked everywhere. We checked through all
the services-Army, Navy and Marines. We couldn't find any 90-millimetre
ammunition at all.&quot; Pianka says the Pentagon sent Israel
the bad news, &quot;In so many words, we said, 'Sorry we don't
have any of the ammunition you need. We've combed all depots and
warehouses, and we simply have none'.&quot; A few days later the
Israelis came back with a surprising message, &quot;Yes, you do.
There are 15,000 rounds in the Marine Corps supply depot in Hawaii.&quot;
Pianka recalls, &quot;We looked in Hawaii and, sure enough, there
they were. The Israelis had found a U.S. supply of 90-millimetre
ammunition we couldn't find ourselves&quot;. In 1996, AIPAC was
not happy with some factual remarks Mr. Patrick Buchanan made
about Israeli influence over American foreign policy, however
AIPAC did not make a big deal about it until Mr. Buchanan ran
for the 1996 presidential elections. AIPAC used its connection
with the media to label him with the most powerful weapon at AIPAC's
disposal: anti-Semitism. Mr. Buchanan was well known for being
a good Catholic who on more than one occasion declared that anti-Semitism
was the greatest of all evils, yet his &quot;mistake&quot; was
that he criticized Israel on various political issues such as
the illegal settlements. He was bombarded with all kinds of criticism
and accusations as being anti-Semite! He was shocked to such public
reaction, but upon further investigations he found out that well-organized
pro-Israel pressure groups, AIPAC and the members of both Houses,
initiated the whole smear campaign directed against him. In February
and March of 1996, while he was campaigning for elections, Zionists
such as New York columnist A.M. Rosenthal, Edward Koch and William
Safire kept demonizing him with slurs of anti-Semitism in the
news media and TV talk and radio shows. He was against the war
on Iraq because it did not serve American national interests,
but serves rather served Israel only, because Iraq was the only
Arab country whose military power posed a challenge to Israel
in the Middle East. As a result of the Zionist lobby, the U.S.
spearheaded a worldwide campaign to go to war against Iraq. Mr.
Buchanan labeled the Congress as &quot;Israeli occupied territory&quot;.
Two groups wanted war with Iraq: the Israeli Defense Ministry
and its counterpart in the U.S.-the members of the House, he explained!
Is it anti-Semitic, he asked, to put American national interests
above the interests of a foreign country?<BR>
Knowing the influence that AIPAC has on the U.S. foreign policy
vis-&agrave;-vis the Middle East, it should behoove all of us
to strengthen our newly developed Arab lobby in Washington in
order to counteract this Zionist octopus that controls the U.S.
foreign policy on the Middle East issues. It should behoove all
Americans who pride themselves as the leaders of the free world
to clip the wings of AIPAC, so that nobody can decide the national
interests of the U.S. in the world except true patriotic Americans,
whose first allegiance is to the U.S. and not a foreign power
such as Israel. As long as the U.S. foreign policy vis-&agrave;-vis
the Middle East is controlled by AIPAC, I can easily see that
all U.S. national interests would become jeopardized if it ever
conflicted with AIPAC. Foreign governments can solicit, for a
price, the support and the services of AIPAC to cater to the interests
of any foreign power, even if it contravenes the U.S. national
interests in the process.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Torture Within The Double Occupation</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Erik Paul</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Palestinian resistance is not something that has come about
over the past few decades but a struggle that has carried on even
before Israel declared itself a state in 1948. The Intifada began
as a culmination of outrage to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian
territory. But occupation within the occupation is more difficult
to resist and harder to fight.</P>

<P>Torture is the cruelest means for a human being to deal with
his or her own kind. It is nothing new for the Israeli Shin Beth
to obtain confessions through physical pressure and there have
been countless deaths of helpless Palestinians through the cruelest
unimaginable means of torture by Israeli hands.</P>

<P>Sad to say, torture and other forms of severe repression are
practiced by Arab regimes throughout the region against their
own people and Israel is hardly alone. Indeed, one of the main
reasons neither the Arafat regime nor neighboring Arab countries
condemn Israeli torture is that they are practicing worse forms
of it themselves.</P>

<P>One wonders then where and how the PNA learned their methods
of forcing confessions from the Palestinian population. Since
the PNA took over control of some of the West Bank towns and Gaza,
many cases have been reported of deaths by torture under the PA
authority. The Palestinians now suffer a double occupation of
their lands and homes.</P>

<P>Only recently, on July 20, Hamas accused the Palestinian security
forces of torturing Imad Awadallah. Mr. Awadallah is currently
incarcerated by the PNA on charges of assassinating a top Hamas
bombmaker. A statement released by Hamas says, &quot;Imad Awadallah
began an unlimited hunger strike 16 days ago to protest against
torture which has continued since his arrest three months ago.&quot;</P>

<P>The statement also said that Palestinian West Bank Preventative
Security Chief Jabril Rajub &quot;believes that torture should
be used with Imad Awadallah until he confesses. Prisoners detained
in Jericho with Awadallah have told their relatives that he is
no longer but a shadow of himself due to maltreatment.&quot;</P>

<P>Imad Awadallah, arrested in April by Palestinian security in
the West Bank is the brother and right-hand man of Adel Awadallah
who is considered the head of Hamas's armed wing and is actively
sought by the Palestinian police. The PNA claims that Imad and
Adel are responsible for the murder of Hamas bombmaker Mohieddin
al Sharif who was found dead in Ramallah in March and further
blames the murder on internal feuds within Hamas's armed wing.
But Hamas rejects this explanation of al Sharif's death and says
he was killed by Israel in collaboration with the PNA.</P>

<P>Surely PNA President Yasser Arafat is nothing more than a puppet
leader and has imposed yet another occupation on an already oppressed
people. Hamas in turn has called on the PNA to immediately free
all political prisoners saying that torture of detainees is a
&quot;violation of human rights and calls into question the basis
of national unity.&quot;</P>

<P>The PNA should be a symbol of freedom of expression and human
rights and stand for the struggle of Palestinian resistance to
the loss of Arab land and homes, and not be a tool for further
oppression and torture.</P>

<P>In an annual report published recently by the Arab Human Rights
Organization it was noted that there has been &quot;an increase
in acts of violence, terrorism, executions, abusive detentions,
torture and a decrease in the number of peaceful protest movements&quot;
in Arab countries.</P>

<P>Life is strange. On the one hand, Imad Awadallah is languishing
in a PA prison while PNA President Yasser Arafat has been called
by one of Colombia's largest rebel groups, The Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, to help mediate a peace agreement between
them and the Colombian government.</P>

<P>But it is best if the PNA leader puts his own house in order
before he tries to straighten out the affairs of others. No one
can justify corruption, no one can condone the use of torture
to extract information or to tyrannize a people who have already
suffered more than they can bear.</P>

<P>Many Palestinians have died from torture at the hands of the
PNA. Only a misfit would use inhuman methods to harm the well-being
of others or to extract confessions. It is time to stop such practices
and to erase the corruption that eats away at the very heart and
soul of the Palestine National Authority, the one body that is
supposed to represent and stand for the rights of the Palestinian
people.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Mahatma Gandhi's Approach to Zionism and the
Palestine Question</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Professor A.K. Ramakrishnan</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Two significant developments in the Palestinian context renewed
our interest in the Gandhian dynamics of struggle and conflict
resolution: (1) the intifadah, which erupted in December 1987
and continued since then as more or less a non-violent struggle
and a non-cooperation movement in the West Bank and Gaza; and
(2) the Oslo peace process through which the Palestinians and
the Israelis adopted peaceful and diplomatic means of conflict
resolution, even though without much SUCCESS.</P>

<P>It is worthwhile in this context to examine Mahatma Gandhi's
own views on the Palestine question and to link them up to the
contemporary dynamics of the issue. Gandhi's attitude towards
Zionism and the attempts at establishing a Jewish State in Palestine
is perceived by many as a controversial one. This paper seeks
to explore the trajectory of Mahatma Gandhi's position on the
Palestine question and tries to bring forth the implications of
his stance on a contemporary Gandhian approach to the Palestine
issue in the changing world of politics and ideas.</P>

<P>Gandhi's major statement on the Palestine and the Jewish question
came forth in his widely circulated editorial in the Harijan of
11 November 1938, a time when intense struggle between the Palestinian
Arabs and the immigrant Jews had been on the anvil in Palestine.
His views came in the context of severe pressure on him, especially
from the Zionist quarters, to issue a statement on the problem.
Therefore, he started his piece by saying that his sympathies
are all with the Jews, who as a people were subjected to inhuman
treatment and persecution for a long time.</P>

<P>&quot;But&quot;, Gandhi asserted, &quot;My sympathy does not
blind me to the requirements of justice. The cry for the national
home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me. The sanction
for it is sought in the Bible and in the tenacity with which the
Jews have hankered after their return to Palestine. Why should
they not, like other peoples of the earth, make that country their
home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood?&quot;</P>

<P>He thus questioned the very foundational logic of political
Zionism. Gandhi rejected the idea of a Jewish State in the Promised
Land by pointing out that the &quot;Palestine of the Biblical
conception is not a geographical tract.&quot; The Zionists, after
embarking upon a policy of colonization of Palestine and after
getting British recognition through the Balfour Declaration of
1917 for &quot;the establishment in Palestine of a national home
for the Jews,&quot; tried to elicit maximum international support.
The Jewish leaders were keen to get an approval for Zionism from
Gandhi as his international fame as the leader of a non-violent
national struggle against imperialism would provide great impetus
for the Jewish cause. But his position was one of total disapproval
of the Zionist project both for political and religious reasons.
He was against the attempts of the British mandatory Government
in Palestine toeing the Zionist line of imposing itself on the
Palestinians in the name of establishing a Jewish national home.
Gandhi's Harijan editorial is an emphatic assertion of the rights
of the Arabs in Palestine. The following oft-quoted lines exemplify
his position:</P>

<P>&quot;Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that
England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is
wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it
would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so
that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as
their national home.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandhi's response to Zionism and the Palestine question contains
different layers of meaning, ranging from an ethical position
to political realism. What is interesting is that Gandhi, who
firmly believed in the inseparability of religion and politics,
had been consistently and vehemently rejecting the cultural and
religious nationalism of the Zionists.</P>

<P>What follows then is that he was not for religion functioning
as a political ideology; rather, he wanted religion to provide
an ethical dimension to nation-State politics. Such a difference
was vital as far as Gandhi was concerned. A uni-religious justification
for claiming a nation-State, as in the case of Zionism, did not
appeal to him in any substantial sense.</P>

<P>The history of Palestine in the first half of this century
has been characterized by the contention between two kinds of
nationalism: Zionism and Palestinian Arab nationalism-the former
striving for creating a Jewish nation in Palestine by colonizing
its land through massive Jewish immigration and the latter struggling
for freedom of the inhabitants of the land of Palestine from colonial
and imperialist control.</P>

<P>Gandhi, in his role as leader of the national struggle and
the Indian National Congress (the organization embodying that
struggle), had been actively engaged during the 1930s and 1940s
in moulding the perception of the people of India to the nationalist
and anti-imperialist struggles in the Arab world. The 1937 Calcutta
meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) &quot;emphatically
protested against the reign of terror as well as the partition
proposals relating to Palestine&quot; and expressed the solidarity
of the Indian people with the Arab peoples' struggle for national
freedom. The Delhi AICC of September 1938 said in its resolution
that Britain should leave the Jews and the Arabs to amicably settle
the issues between the two parties, and it urged the Jews &quot;not
to take shelter behind British Imperialism.&quot; Gandhi wanted
the Jews in Palestine to seek the goodwill of the Arabs by discarding
&quot;the help of the British bayonet.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandhi and the Congress thus openly supported Palestinian Arab
nationalism, and Gandhi was more emphatic in the rejection of
Zionist nationalism. The major political driving force in such
a position was the common legacy of anti-imperialist struggle
of the Indians and the Palestinians. Gandhi's views on the Zionist
doctrine and his firm commitment to the Palestinian cause starting
from the 1930s obviously influenced the design of independent
India's position on the Palestine issue.</P>

<P>Gandhi's prescription for the Jews in Germany and the Arabs
in Palestine was non-violent resistance. With regard to the Jewish
problem in Germany, Gandhi noted, &quot;I am convinced that if
someone with courage and vision can arise among them to lead them
in non-violent action, the winter of their despair can, in the
twinkling of an eye, be turned into the summer of hope.&quot;
His views on Zionism and his prescription of non-violent action
and self-sacrifice to the Jews in Germany generated reactions
ranging from anger to despair. Famous Jewish pacifists, Martin
Buber, Judah Magnes and Hayim Greenberg, who otherwise admired
Gandhi, felt &quot;highly offended by Gandhi's anti-Zionism&quot;
and criticized him for his lack of understanding of the spirit
of Zionism. Martin Buber, in a long reply to Gandhi's Harijan
editorial, remarked, &quot;You are only concerned, Mahatma, with
the &quot;right of possession&quot; on the one side; you do not
consider the right to a piece of free land on the other side -
for those who are hungering for it.&quot;</P>

<P>As mentioned earlier, Gandhi refused to view the Zionist &quot;hunger&quot;
for land in Palestine as a right. Gandhi wrote on 7 January 1939
the following in response to an editorial in the Statesman, &quot;I
hold that non-violence is not merely a personal virtue. It is
also a social virtue to be cultivated like the other virtues.
Surely society is largely regulated by the expression of non-violence
in its mutual dealing. What I ask for is an extension of it on
a larger, national and international scale.&quot;</P>

<P>Also, it is significant to note that, as far as Gandhi was
concerned, non-violent action was not pacifism or a defensive
activity but a way of waging war. This war without violence also
requires discipline, training and the assessment of the strength
and weakness of the enemy.</P>

<P><B>According to Paul Power, four factors influenced Gandhi's
position on Zionism:</B></P>

<P>&quot;First, he was sensitive about the ideas of Muslim Indians
who were anti-Zionists because of their sympathy for Middle Eastern
Arabs opposed to the Jewish National Home; second, he objected
to any Zionist methods inconsistent with his way of non-violence;
third, he found Zionism contrary to his pluralistic nationalism,
which excludes the establishment of any State based solely or
mainly on one religion; and fourth, he apparently believed it
imprudent to complicate his relations with the British, who held
the mandate in Palestine.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandhi withstood almost all Zionist attempts at extracting
a pro-Zionist stance from him. G.H. Jansen wrote about the failure
of Zionist lobbying with Gandhi:</P>

<P>&quot;His opposition [to Zionism] remained consistent over
a period of nearly 20 years and remained firm despite skilful
and varied applications to him of that combination of pressure
and persuasion known as lobbying, of which the Zionists are past
masters.&quot;</P>

<P>Apart from responses to Gandhi's anti-Zionism from Jewish pacifists
such as Buber, Magnes and Greenberg, Jansen points out at least
four separate instances of Zionist attempts to get a favourable
statement from Gandhi. At first, Hermann Kallenbach, Gandhi's
Jewish friend in South Africa, came to India in 1937 and stayed
for weeks with Gandhi trying to convince him of the merits of
the Zionist cause. Then, in the 1930s, as requested by Rabbi Stephen
Wise, the American pacifist John Haynes Holmes, tried &quot;to
obtain from Gandhi a declaration favourable to Zionism&quot;.
In March 1946, a British MP from the Labour Party, Sydney Silverman,
an advocate of Indian independence in Britain, attempted to change
Gandhi's mind. At the end of their heated conversation, Gandhi
stated that &quot;after all our talk, I am unable to revise the
opinion I gave you in the beginning.&quot; The fourth Zionist
attempt to change Gandhi's mind was by Louis Fischer, Gandhi's
famous biographer, to whom Gandhi reported to have said that &quot;the
Jews have a good case.&quot;</P>

<P>Later, Gandhi clarified in one of his final pieces on Zionism
and the Palestine question on 14 July 1946 that &quot;I did say
some such thing in the course of a conversation with Mr. Louis
Fischer on the subject.&quot; He added, &quot;I do believe that
the Jews have been cruelly wronged by the world.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandhi went back to his initial position by categorically stating
that &quot;But in my opinion, they [the Jews] have erred grievously
in seeking to impose themselves on Palestine with the aid of America
and Britain and now with the aid of naked terrorism... Why should
they depend on American money or British arms for forcing themselves
on an unwelcome land? Why should they resort to terrorism to make
good their forcible landing in Palestine?&quot;</P>

<P>There were an influential number of Jews who thought that force,
only force, could ensure the establishment of a Jewish national
home in Palestine. They adopted terrorism as the method to achieve
their national goal. This policy of subjugation of the Palestinians
by Zionist terror was totally rejected by Gandhi in no uncertain
terms.</P>

<P>A few months before his assassination, Gandhi answered the
question &quot;What is the solution to the Palestine problem?&quot;
raised by Doon Campbell of Reuters:</P>

<P>&quot;It has become a problem which seems almost insoluble.
If I were a Jew, I would tell them: 'Do not be so silly as to
resort to terrorism...' The Jews should meet the Arabs, make friends
with them and not depend on British aid or American aid, save
what descends from Jehovah.&quot;</P>

<P>Edward Said wrote that &quot;The Palestinian mission is a mission
of peace.&quot; The constructive aspect of any mission of peace
was paramount to Gandhi. The constructive rebuilding of Palestinian
society initiated through the intifadah should continue especially
in the wake of the failure of the diplomatic route taken since
the Oslo process. Such constructive responses against Israeli
occupation can form the seeds of real national freedom which the
Palestinians cherish.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Developments On The Nuclear Front</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Aisha Khan</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>More than two months have passed since India, followed by Pakistan,
took the monumental decision to detonate their nuclear devices.
The extent of the fallout is still unclear. While relations between
the two traditionally hostile nations reached an all-time low
in the past decade as a result of the nuclear tests, they also
forced each country to begin negotiations concerning &quot;no
first-use pacts&quot; and regional test ban agreements.</P>

<P>Indian Prime Minister Atal Behar Vajpayee will be holding informal
talks with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan at the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit, to be held
in Colombo, Sri Lanka, from 29 to 31 July 1998.</P>

<P>Faced with international pressure to defuse the &quot;security
crisis&quot; in the subcontinent, there is speculation that the
talks could lead to some sort of &quot;no first-use pact&quot;,
and also to make some progress in forming a common approach to
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, an express desire by India.</P>

<P>Not many realists, however, are pinning much hope on the meeting
since Pakistan has made it clear that it will not sign the CTB
Treaty till it gets a &quot;clear demonstration from the major
powers of their involvement in the issues of peace and security,&quot;
by which it means intervention in the northern Indian State of
Kashmir.</P>

<P>This is one condition that India will not countenance, since
it has always maintained that the Muslim-majority State is an
integral part of it and has resisted third-party intervention
saying that the troubles of the strife-torn State have to be dealt
with bilaterally.</P>

<P>To be fair, however, it was India that went to the United Nations
in 1949, when Pakistan occupied a portion of Kashmir known as
Azad Kashmir or Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, depending on which
side of the border you are on. Since then, Pakistan has tried
to drum up support for a plebiscite in Kashmir to finish off the
unfinished agenda of the Partition.</P>

<P>Immediately after the tests, the Indian home minister, in an
intemperate speech, warned Pakistan that the &quot;geostrategic&quot;
balance in the subcontinent has changed and advised it to roll
back its subversive activities in the State. Another Cabinet minister
challenged Pakistan to &quot;name a date and place&quot; to resolve
the dispute. With this, India hurt its own position, appearing
to be the big bully and giving Pakistan the handle to link the
nuclear tests and security balance, as well as talks on the CTB
Treaty, to the resolution of the Kashmir crisis.</P>

<P>Both countries have sent special envoys to the United States,
which had reacted sharply and swiftly with economic sanctions
linked to the tests, for talks with various officials. Indian
emissary Jaswatn Singh also met U.S. deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott for secret talks in Frankfurt. Mr. Talbott will
be visiting both Islamabad and New Delhi before the SAARC summit
during the latter part of July.</P>

<P>The talks will surely gain new significance as the Clinton
administration has sought the &quot;authority&quot; of the U.S.
Congress to waive all the sanctions imposed against the countries.
The move came after the Senate exempted U.S. farm credit programmes
from the sanctions. While seeking the authority to do so, the
administration stated that it would not exercise the exemption
till it felt some &quot;substantive steps&quot; had been made
on signing the CTB Treaty and non-proliferation.</P>

<P>Indian officials saw the move as an effort to bail out Pakistan,
a longstanding dependent on trade with the U.S. Some commentators,
however, feel the move shows that the whole exercise was pre-planned.
They argue that the U.S. had known India was planning to go nuclear
and had in fact encouraged it in a bid to undercut and put pressure
on China. A month before the tests, the Indian defence minister
had gone to town with unsubstantiated allegations against China,
and also gave it the appellation of &quot;number one threat&quot;
to India. Having created an atmosphere of distrust with its giant
neighbour, the Indian PM had sighted poor relations with China
as the reason for the nuclear tests. The fact was, however, exactly
the opposite, as relations with China had been on the mend throughout
the 1990s.</P>

<P>The China-baiting, however, was stopped abruptly after China
reacted strongly, and since then, the focus has become Indo-Pak
relations and the thorny issue of Kashmir.</P>

<P>The U.S., however, has gained a convenient entry point, if
not foothold, into the subcontinent, not only with Pakistan inviting
it to mediate in Kashmir, but also with its self-imposed role
of nuclear policeman. On the economic front, the U.S. has flexed
its muscles, having temporarily closed the tap on development
aid to India and Pakistan as well as its own trade with them.
While in the long run, the sanctions, if implemented seriously
would hurt U.S. business as much as the Indian or Pakistani economy,
have created an atmosphere in which both of these countries can
go ahead with the sellout of their economic sovereignty to the
West in the name of &quot;globalization and liberalization&quot;,
citing the sanctions as a pretext for their actions.</P>

<P>A very senior Indian government official remarked in private
soon after the tests that the Bharatiya Janata Party government
had multiple goals in mind when it went ahead. Apart from forcing
Pakistan into a nuclear weapons programme it can ill afford, it
also embarrassed China by trying to make public its technology
transfer to Pakistan. On the domestic front, the move was aimed
at consolidating the shaky two-month-old coalition regime of the
Hindu right-wing outfit, paving the way for &quot;tough economic
reforms&quot; in the name of austerity measures, as well as whipping
up an emotive issue to consolidate its electoral support base.</P>

<P>The last aim, of using the bomb as an emotive issue, seems
to have somewhat backfired. Right from the day of the test, the
BJP and its extreme right-wing network of parties claimed full
credit for the &quot;achievement&quot; and succeeded in painting
the bomb in &quot;Hindu&quot; colours.</P>

<P>The manner in which celebrations were organized, totally monopolized
by communal outfits as well as the initial suggestion of building
a Hindu temple or shrine at the site of the tests, evoked guarded
responses, especially from the Muslims, as well as criticism from
other political parties.</P>

<P>While Muslims in India in themselves have not tried to create
a separate stand on the issue, the manner in which the communal-fascist
lobby tried to appropriate the bomb as a symbol of Hindu India
has naturally caused worry. The BJP and its parent and mentor
organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer
Corps), have always been notoriously &quot;majoritarian&quot;,
bordering on fascist, bodies. After all, this is the same party
that demolished the 14th century Babari Mosque six years ago.
Unimpressed by the diversity of religions and cultures, these
bodies have always defined the Indian nationality in exclusivist
terms: to be Indian is to be Hindu. This formula conveniently
puts a question mark on the Indian-ness of Indian minorities,
notably the Muslims, who they &quot;urge&quot; to give up the
&quot;sectarian&quot; mindset and join the &quot;mainstream.&quot;</P>

<P>The nuclear tests have once again raised the issue of nationalism
and patriotism. &quot;Any expression of self-respect shows the
Hindu identity&quot;, said the RSS secretary general H.V. Sheshadri,
in an interview after the blasts, clearly signaling that the bomb
is an assertion of Hindu pride.</P>

<P>While every Indian Muslim would like to take pride in what
is seen by some as a national achievement brought about by a Muslim
scientist (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Azad), he cannot help wondering
whether the nationalist hysteria, bordering on xenophobia, generated
after the blasts included him.</P>

<P>Even non-Muslims, secular intellectuals, Leftist parties and
other champions of nuclear disarmament found their patriotic credentials
under fire after the tests. Any domestic criticism of the decision
to go nuclear is met with accusations of treachery and anti-nationalism.</P>

<P>Added to the Indian Muslims dilemma is the hostility with Pakistan,
a country where many, especially from North India, have relatives.</P>

<P>Within India, however, the euphoria soon died down after sanctions
were imposed, and it became increasingly clear that the BJP government
was not acting as much on behalf of national interests as much
as it was acting on the interests of its own survival.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Black Panthers and Colonialism</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Fazeel Azeez Chauhan</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>The Civil Rights Movement heroically reversed the effects of
slavery in America. Even today, it is important to understand
what strategies were used to create slavery so that we can better
defend ourselves. The British Colonialists used the same tactics
to create self-hatred among the natives of India.</P>

<P>What is the process that turns a human being into a creature
of self-hatred and self-doubt whereby the enslaved becomes fully
controlled and fearful of another person? The slave master uses
the process known as &quot;seasoning&quot; to condition slaves.
Strong men and women are broken down, tortured and stripped of
their dignity through seasoning. The process re-makes the person
into an image, pleasing to the oppressor.</P>

<P>To maintain fear and control, seasoning usually involves the
enforcement of five strategies:</P>

<P>1- Establish and maintain strict rules.<BR>
2- Implant in the slave a consciousness of personal inferiority.<BR>
3- Make the slave believe that the master has enormous power.<BR>
4- Strip the slave of his roots and identity, including his name,
culture, history and language. Make the slave admire the standards
of &quot;good&quot; conduct of the master, so that the slave longs
to be like the master.<BR>
5- Impress upon the slave his utter sense of helplessness to create
a habit of perfect dependence.</P>

<P>When the slave fears for his own personal life, more than the
survival of the group, the seasoning process is complete. This
is yet another example of the philosophy of divide and conquer.
It creates mistrust, apathy and cynicism among the poisoned society.
Similar to the slave masters, the British Colonialists proclaimed
proudly, &quot;We will not only rule them, we will control their
hearts and souls for generations to come.&quot;</P>

<P>On 15 October 1966, the Black Panthers for Self Defense Party
was created to combat this racist philosophy, which continued
through Apartheid and segregation. The Black Panther Party played
an essential role in the Civil Rights Movement. The founders were
fed up with the non-violent approach, because African Americans
were being killed, beaten, humiliated and oppressed every day.
Bobby Seale and Huey Newton decided one day to take matters in
their own hands to change the injustices of the status quo. Within
an hour, they came up with the goals of their party, those being:</P>

<P>1. Freedom and power to determine the destiny of their community.<BR>
2. Full employment for their people.<BR>
3. An end to the exploitation of their Black community by Capitalists.<BR>
4. Decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.<BR>
5. Education for their people, which exposes the true nature of
the American society. They wanted education that teaches them
their true history and their role in the present day society.<BR>
6. All Black men to be exempt from military service.<BR>
7. Immediate end to police brutality and murder of Black people.<BR>
8. Freedom for all Black men held in jail.<BR>
9. All Black people who are brought to trial should be tried by
a jury of their own peers, from their own community.<BR>
10. They wanted land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice
and peace. They wanted a Black Colony.</P>

<P>Langston Hughes, a famous musician, was a Black Panther who
said, &quot;The Panther in his desperate boldness wears no disguise.
He is motivated by the truest of the oldest lies.&quot; The text
paper &quot;Arm the Masses&quot; proclaims, &quot;What we believe
equals revolutionary nationalism and socialism for the Black Nation.
Forty million Africans are captured inside the racist, capitalist
U.S.A....&quot;. To help their community, the Black Panthers designed
new and innovative social programmes that continue to this day.
These include, but are not limited to, free breakfasts for students,
free medical clinics, free clothing and shoes, free education
and assistance for the elderly.</P>

<P>FBI director J. Edgar Hoover called the Black Panthers &quot;the
greatest threat to the internal security of the country&quot;.
The police and the FBI infiltrated the Panthers through their
Counter Intelligence Program to destroy the party and assassinate
its leaders. They provoked violence between the Panthers and the
U.S. Government. They created internal fragmentation through their
propaganda to stop the Panthers' alliances with other groups.</P>

<P>One of the leaders was Kathleen Cleaver. She received a law
degree from Yale and is a Professor at Emory University Law School
in Atlanta. A reporter, Eldridge Cleaver, joined the Panthers
two years after the assassination of Malcolm X (Malik Shahbaz).
Eldridge (El Rage) was soon framed with a murder case and the
couple had to go into exile in Algeria. Their Muslim son was raised
there and in Somalia. Eldridge passed away a few weeks ago.</P>

<P>The Panthers admired the revolutionary Philosophy of Malik
Shahbaz, who called for freedom and justice for the oppressed
people &quot;by any means necessary&quot;. A major activity of
the Panthers was policing the police. They confronted the police,
equipped with law books and rifles, when it was legal to do so.
For further information, read a book or see the movie &quot;Panther&quot;.
Their common slogan was &quot;Power to the People. Power to the
People&quot;. We should be grateful to African Americans for their
sacrifices. We enjoy several freedoms because they fought to attain
these rights for all of us.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Landmines: Hidden Enemies</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Ruba Farkh</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>As the words came flowing out of her mouth, hot tears trickled
down her cheeks while everybody around her just broke into tears.
Reem was telling the audience how she lost her 7-year-old son
in a landmine explosion some 9 months previous. Though her words
were simple, there was a strange power in what she said, perhaps
because it was a mother's agony put into words over the loss of
her child.</P>

<P>As she remembered what happened on that awful day, her voice
shivered as if she was seeing what happened all over again in
front of her eyes. &quot;It looked like some sort of water pipe;
it was thrown on top of the ground. I had never seen anything
like it before&quot;, she said. &quot;My boys and their cousins
played with it then left it in the garden. After they came back
from school the next day, my son Ibraheem started to play with
it. That's when its spring went off, causing a big explosion.
I thought the house was about to come down. When I went outside
to see what happened, there was blood all over the place. I didn't
know who took the blow; the kids were all shouting and crying.
Ibraheem died in the hospital, and two of my children and two
of my sister's children were also injured. The whole family was
traumatized after the incident. Kalaf, my elder son and the one
who found the landmine, is still blaming himself for the death
of his brother.&quot; Reem continued as she looked into the tearful
staring eyes of the audience, &quot;You can never imagine the
pain I'm in. What hurts me most is that he had to die this way.
His father said, 'I wish Ibraheem was with no arms or legs but
stayed alive so I can hear him calling me DADDY!'&quot;</P>

<P>After that incident, four other landmines were found in Silwad,
Reem's village near the city of Ramallah, because people became
very cautious about every strange object they came upon. Wars
that took place in this region left a deadly legacy behind, one
that has injured and claimed the lives of so many people, even
more than nuclear, chemical and biological weapons did combined.
It has made the Middle East and North Africa the most mine-polluted
region in the world. Egypt alone is estimated to have around 23
million mines, thus being the most extensively mined country in
the world, while the biggest humanitarian problem caused by uncleared
mines in the region is found in Iraqi Kurdistan, with an estimated
4 million mines.</P>

<P>At the conference &quot;Surviving the Scourge of Landmines&quot;,
held in Amman in June 1998, the first of its kind in the Middle
East on landmine injury and rehabilitation, over 350 participants
from over 30 countries of the region attended the conference.
There were around 35 landmine survivors who came to talk about
their trauma. One could tell from the stories told how terrible
their experiences must have been. At the same time, one cannot
but wonder: how is it that only 4 countries signed the treaty
banning antipersonnel landmines out of the 18 countries that comprise
this highly polluted landmine area? The tragedies that were related
at the conference makes one truly realize how deadly these hidden
enemies are, yet it seems that nobody is willing or ready to do
anything about it, despite the fact that almost every country
in the region is suffering from this dreadful situation. Still,
there is little effort made to rid the region of this nightmare.
Every 22 minutes a man, woman, or child is maimed or killed by
a landmine. Nearly 80% of landmine victims are civilians, including
innocent women and children, injured of no fault of their own.</P>

<P>Although the last war between the Arabs and Israel was some
20 years ago, there are still victims falling every day as a consequence
of the buried landmines on the borders or even near the populated
areas. The most dangerous kind by far are those made in the shape
of harmless objects such as pens, toys, or even a biscuit, as
in the incident Reem mentioned, which occurred in the West Bank
near the refugee camp of Shoufat with some kids who were playing
with it, and ended up claiming the lives of four of them. Once
more, one cannot help but really wonder: why target innocent children
in this cruel manner? Or else why use such a deceiving shape?
Israel has been a significant landmine producer and exporter.
Up to 80% of the landmine sales went to foreign customers before
the Government instituted a moratorium on the export of antipersonnel
mines in 1996. Israel has produced and exported antipersonnel
mines since the 1970s. It has reportedly used mines in the Israeli-occupied
border zone in southern Lebanon, in the occupied Golan Heights,
in the West Bank, and along the Jordanian borders. In the two-day
conference that took place in Amman in June, a bill of rights
was adopted. The &quot;bill of rights for landmine survivors&quot;
advocates the right for landmine survivors to be more fully involved
in decisions affecting their own rehabilitation. Jordan, being
the host of the conference, announced its intention to sign the
treaty banning antipersonnel landmines after approval of the decision
that was taken by the Jordanian cabinet.</P>

<P>The fact that there is still a chance, no matter how remote,
that landmines may still maim new victims should put the clearance
of landmines on the top priority list. At the same time, States
should review all new weapons in the light of the criteria laid
down by the international humanitarian law. Such an examination
should go far in ensuring that a problem of this magnitude would
never happen again.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Preparations for a United Arab Economy</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By Fatima Hamilton</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Presently, the Middle East is weak and under the thumb of Western
Powers. We always beg them for help and for money. The only way
to stand on our own feet is to unite as one region, as we were
in the past, and to unite our economy. Uniting our economy can
help us to bridge the gaps and to unite as a people--as a strong
nation--as Europe is now doing with the European Union.</P>

<P>We do have advantages that they don't. We have one language-Arabic--and
one race. We even share similar traditions, and the majority shares
the same religion. Therefore it should be easier to unite. It
will not be easy, but in the end it will be beneficial to our
future and our children's future.</P>

<P>A &quot;United Arab Economy&quot; was tried once before when
Jordan-Iraq and Egypt-Yemen had begun economic sharing; however,
it was abandoned upon the advent of the Gulf war. It was never
restarted. There has been an interest, and it is quite possible.</P>

<P>We need to make plans and preparations for this kind of system.
There should be conferences and studies done to ensure the application
of the right methods.</P>

<P>First, experts, thinkers and educated people from all the Arab
countries should be brought together to discuss a United Arab
Economy and the best methods to achieve this goal. All angles
should be researched, discussed, studied and a workable and solid
plan should be formed from these minds.</P>

<P>Unity should be encouraged among the people in order to help
the united economy. The people should force their Governments
to allow the United Arab Economy and the unity of all Arab peoples.</P>

<P>The people can increase their unity and break down barriers
that were caused by extensive (or excessive) nationalism. In the
end, we're all Arabs. So, we should hold dialogues, encourage
trade with one another, help each other (as we see Jordan sending
food, medicine and money to Iraq) and worship together. Worshipping
together brings hearts together. We should keep close contact
with friends, colleagues, etc. in other Arab countries, as well
as throughout the world through the use of the Internet and other
methods of modern technology. Our goal should be to build a strong,
unified, Arab society. Unity among the people can be encouraged
more when the Governments officially decide to unify the economy.
This would increase our dealings with one another. To have a successful
United Arab Economy, we must be united on every level.</P>

<P>The advantage would be a strong society, a strong army to defend
us, the ability to maintain our lands and to retrieve lost land
as well as to gain the respect of the World Community because
we would become a strong power as they are.</P>

<P>However, the West would try their best to crush this movement.
We've seen that any country attempting to be strong faces trouble
from America, Israel and certain European countries. For example,
Iraq had a strong military, advanced education and technology
(the best in the Middle East) and they were crushed. Now Pakistan
and Iran want powerful weapons, and they are facing condemnation
from America and possible future trouble. So when we decide to
unite as a strong power, we should expect the West to try to prevent
this and be prepared to retaliate. They want to be the only strong
world power and to keep &quot;Third World Countries&quot; beneath
them.</P>

<P>We must be strong and realize that we can survive on our own
if we pull together. We have in the Middle East many resources
such as oil, gold, and rivers in Iraq and Egypt; we also have
great and creative minds here that are not being used to their
full potential. We must change this and support people who have
good ideas. The Government and the society should support them
so we can keep them here, otherwise they'll immigrate to America
or Canada to find a better and more fulfilling life. We must enhance
and redevelop our educational systems and organization in all
parts of our society. We must build factories and learn to invent
and to produce what we need. We also must stop taking money from
the World Bank and depend upon ourselves. When we borrow from
the World Bank, they control us because they always set conditions
for us to follow. We must break free. Once we are strong, then
we can make our own decisions and decide the course of our society;
also, when we have power and they fear us, we can decide to set
peace on our own terms, if we so desire. But in the end, if we
are united, the West can no longer play their silly, political
games with us.</P>

<P>To have a United Arab Economy, we have to look at not only
the political aspects, but also the financial aspects that will
run such a system. We need to prepare for this system. First,
we must identify what the Arab countries produce or don't produce,
what resources they have and what they can offer. We need a comprehensive
system. We should import and export from each other. We must stop
using foreign products and buy from each other; we should support
ourselves. (We should ensure quality in our products so that people
would buy Arab products, and Arabs must learn to have consumer
confidence in themselves.)</P>

<P>Secondly, we need to set a budget and our Union Currency; we
must make Union Capital from all of these countries. We can follow
the Islamic Banking System; even some banks in the West have begun
to use parts from the Islamic Banking principles. They find it
to have advantages. So, we should recognize Islamic Banking as
being very beneficial.</P>

<P>Also, regular evaluations and studies must be carried out to
check that things are running smoothly. We must improve our computer
and banking systems as well as set a methodology for organization.
The people need to be motivated to increase their education and
to seek the enhancement of technology.</P>

<P>A Board of Trustees must be joined together from all the countries
to ensure consultation. These members must be educated, knowledgeable
and have a clean record. This group of people must be good and
chosen well, otherwise we'll be in trouble. A system of checks
and balances must be in place to look upon these Trustees and
upon the system.</P>

<P>All Arab countries must be included, even Iraq and Libya even
though the West will try to enforce sanctions. We must ignore
the West, know that we're right and trust in ourselves. If we
are together, we can help each other and stand strong against
our enemies. So, the best way to begin is to unify the people
and to unify our economy. This is no easy task, but we must begin
somewhere and some time soon.</P>

<P>Following the remarkable resurgence of Islamic political activism
in recent decades, radical Islamist movements now have a presence
in almost every Muslim country and form the major opposition forces
to the established regimes in the Middle East.</P>

<P>This important book deepens our understanding of the influence
of contemporary Islamism by providing the first definitive history
of the meteoric rise of the mother organization of all modern
Islamist movements, the Society of the Muslim Brothers. Founded
in 1928 by a young primary school teacher, Hasan al-Banna, the
society rose to become the largest mass movement in modern Egyptian
history in less than two decades, clashing with the ruling elite
on a wide range of issues.</P>

<P>Brynjar Lia examines the socio-economic and cultural factors
which facilitated the movement's expansion and analyses the keys
to its success- its organization, internal structure, modes of
action and recruitment techniques as well as its ideological and
class appeal.</P>

<P>Drawing on a wealth of new sources which include British War
Office and Foreign Office files, security files from the Egyptian
National Archives and the Society's newspapers and internal publications
from the 1930s and early 1940s, this book also makes extensive
use of the memories and personal letters of Muslim Brother veterans.
The author has spent many years in Egypt interviewing old and
younger members of this influential society.</P>

<P>Brynjar Lia is a Research Scientist at the Norwegian Defence
Research Establishment and teaches at the Institute of East-European
and Oriental Studies at the University of Oslo. His understanding
of Arab affairs is such that he was selected as a member of the
International Observer Force in the city of Hebron, West Bank,
in 1996.</P>

<P>THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION dominates the Middle East and the
Arab-Israeli struggle, preoccupying the world since the early
1920s when the Judaization of a predominantly Arab country began.
British military might and Jewish wealth combined under the guise
of a League of Nations 'mandate' to implement the Balfour Declaration
through which another people's country was promised and delivered
to immigrants of a religious community scattered all over the
world. This monumental work (894 pages) is the first attempt in
English to put together almost all the documentary records pertaining
to the Palestinian Question from the very beginning to the present
day, including the full text of the Oslo Agreement and its annexes
as well as the latest treaty signed between Israel and Jordan.
Documents have been sourced from British Government papers and
inquiry commissions reports, Israeli laws, the United Nations,
the Arab League, Zionist organizations and PLO resolutions and
documents, including the Palestinian National Charter, where the
articles objectionable to Israel have also been pointed out. Short
introductions and annotations to many texts provide context and
background to the documents. It also contains 24 maps concerning
all the stages of the modern Palestinian history, in addition
to authentic basic information and facts and figures about Palestine.
An introductory chapter brilliantly sums up modern Palestinian
history in an historical overview that puts the issue in sharp
perspective.</P>

<P>Many documents previously available only in Arabic have been
translated into English especially for this work, which has been
compiled and annotated by the well-known scholar, Dr Zafarul-Islam
Khan, a keen student of the Palestinian issue for over three decades.
His works on Palestine include his MA (Master of Arts) thesis
at Cairo University (1978) about the Palestinian Arab resistance
to Judaization, a study of a sacred Jewish scripture (al-Talmud
[Beirut 1971]) and a history of ancient Palestine (Tarikh Filastin
al-Qadim [Beirut 1973]). Among his recent contributions is &quot;Focus
on Palestine&quot; (1993), a three-part special issue of the Muslim
and Arab Perspectives, which he edits in addition to the Journal
of Islamic History. The Delhi-based Institute of Islamic and Arab
Studies, which he heads, publishes both these internationally
acclaimed journals. The Institute recently organized a two-day
international academic seminar in New Delhi on the Palestinian
Question.</P>

<P>The book is a major contribution to Palestinian studies and
a basic tool for researchers in Middle Eastern studies. No library
should be without it.<BR>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>The Gold Coins</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><U>By E. Yaghi</U></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Once upon a time in the land of Kan Zaman a young son said
to his father, &quot;Sir, I want to get married.&quot;</P>

<P>Now the father, long concerned with the negligence and carelessness
of his only son replied, &quot;OK my boy. Come, let's go to the
sea and I will tell you if it is time for you to marry or not.&quot;</P>

<P>So, father and son went to the turquoise water where heaven
and earth appeared to meet. The sea was calm and gentle and its
waves reached like delicate arms out to the shoreline. Seagulls
dived low in their search for a meal and the air carried dainty
wisps of the fragrance of wild roses and salt water over the land.</P>

<P>&quot;Let's see my boy if you are ready to marry or not,&quot;
the father said to his son as he pulled a small worn pouch out
of his pants pocket.</P>

<P>The lad wondered what such a worn pouch could possibly have
to do with his getting married but remained curiously silent,
waiting for some kind of explanation from the man he expected
to pay for his wedding.</P>

<P>&quot;Take this bag of gold coins boy and see if you can throw
it as far as that wave over there,&quot; he said pointing to a
distant lap of water. &quot;If you hit that wave, then I promise
that I will pay for your wedding and you can have the choice of
any girl you wish who lives in our village.&quot;</P>

<P>He studied his son carefully hoping to hear words he knew would
not be forthcoming. Instead, all he saw was the eager eyes of
his boy and the excited look on his face as he happily agreed
to toss the gold coins into the sea.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, Sir, this is great! Just watch me, for I'm famous
for throwing long distances so I'll show you what I can do and
how I am ready to be married!&quot;</P>

<P>The father held firmly to the pouch for one brief moment and
then let go. It happened so quickly that he almost missed seeing
the gold coins in the pouch fly by as his son grabbed the treasure
and tossed it to the distant wave.</P>

<P>He could not hide his disappointment when he said, &quot;Oh,
dear! I'm afraid you've lost my gold and you did not hit the wave
you were supposed to. Now I'll have to work a couple more years
until I save up enough gold for you to do this again.&quot;</P>

<P>The father noticed that his disappointment became his son's.
That evening, when the sun rolled down over the navy-blue hills
and crickets chirped to the summer air, the pair slowly walked
home in silence.</P>

<P>It took some years for the father to save up enough money to
buy gold again. One day his son approached him with the same statement.
&quot;Father, I must get married! Please help me!&quot;</P>

<P>Still convinced that his son was not ready to accept responsibility
and was careless with his own affairs, the father replied, &quot;Yes,
my son, you are right. Come, let's go and see if you can hit that
wave yet or not.&quot;</P>

<P>So the two men went once more to the shoreline. The son looked
excited as his arm was stronger and more muscular than before
and he was sure to hit the wave this time so visions of his soon-to-be
bride floated through his head as his father reached deep into
his pants pocket to take out another pouch filled with gold coins.</P>

<P>Slowly the elder man pulled out the pouch and with some effort
handed the treasure to his son. &quot;If you hit the wave this
time, I will go with you to ask for the hand of the best girl
in the village,&quot; the father declared. He couldn't help but
notice the eager anticipation of his son. Seagulls again dived
for an evening meal and the aroma of wild roses and the mist of
the sea enveloped the shoreline but did not ease the father's
disappointment over his son's lack of responsibility and concern.</P>

<P>Though his arm was stronger, the son still did not hit the
wave. Frustration was written all over his face. The shadow of
the two figures blended in with the shadows of the surrounding
forest. The walk home seemed long and tedious. At last the father
said to his son before retiring for the night, &quot;Well my boy,
I guess you'll have to wait a few more years until I save up enough
money for your wedding.&quot;</P>

<P>Years passed. The son, unable to wait any longer once again
approached his father and said, &quot;Father, I'm getting older
and I must get married!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You are right,&quot; the father nodded in agreement.
&quot;But I am getting too old to work much longer. You must work
now and save your own money to wed yourself.&quot;</P>

<P>The son had no choice so he went to work. More years passed
and one Spring day, when blossoms of every imaginable color decorated
the village yards and leaves grew strong and green on groomed
trees, the son once more approached his father and said, &quot;Sir,
I have saved up enough money to pay for my own wedding. Come and
let us ask for the hand of a girl who will share my life with
me.&quot;</P>

<P>The father knew his son was no longer as careless and irresponsible
as he had once been but he wanted to be certain so he replied,
&quot;Of course my son. Take some of your gold coins that you
have saved and let's take a walk and see what we can do.&quot;</P>

<P>Father and son once more went to the fresh Spring sea shining
like a turquoise mirror in the evening sun. Fish jumped up through
the water to catch small insects surfacing on the top of the waves
and seagulls cried and dived as seagulls before them had done
for eons. The fragrance of the air was like the most expensive
perfume and the sweet aroma of newly blossomed wild pink and red
roses blended with the salt of the evaporating water filling the
shoreline with its presence.</P>

<P>&quot;Come my son. Let's see if you are ready to marry or not.
Have you got your gold coins with you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes father of course. I did as you requested so we can
seek an appropriate bride, one who will share my life with me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Fine. Now I want you to take your coins and see if you
can throw them as far as that wave over there.&quot; He pointed
with his finger to a distant wave, one that would be impossible
to hit.</P>

<P>The father saw his son's expression change from joy to concern
and the young man stated with firm conviction, &quot;Father, do
you think me a fool? I worked so hard to save up money to buy
these gold coins. How can I be so stupid as to throw them in the
sea? What good will they possibly do me at the bottom of the water
where I will never be able to find them or retrieve them?&quot;</P>

<P>The father was pleased and knew that at last his son had become
responsible enough to handle his own affairs. He then said, &quot;And
how do you think I felt when you threw my gold coins in the sea?
Didn't I get tired earning them too? But I also am not a fool.
I put rocks in those pouches you so easily threw to hit the waves.
Come let's go and find you a wife. It's time now that you find
a partner with whom to share your life. At last you really are
ready to marry!&quot; .</P>

<P>He rushed quickly along the dirt roads of the camp to the chosen
place. Once he reached the only bedroom in his old house, he put
on an aged pair of spectacles with one broken lens. He reached
behind the bed and grabbed his old rifle and a small dirty bag
of bullets. The old rifle looked fresh and polished as if it had
been cleaned just that day. He grabbed these belongings along
with a deed that was hidden under the bed and breathlessly walked
toward a group of journalists as if he was ready to tell a very
long and sad story.</P>

<P>A CNN reporter knew the man as 73-year-old Abu Mohammed-a Palestinian
refugee who lived in the camps of South Lebanon. From his appearance
and the condition of his house, the old man appeared to have lived
in poverty all of his life. &quot;Not so&quot;, shouted Abu Mohammed
with a crying voice. His frail and wrinkled hands tried to hide
the river of tears flowing from his eyes. Abu Mohammed stated
that his years of poverty and desperation only started after his
expulsion from Palestine with his family 50 years ago. For five
decades the old Palestinian warrior never gave up the dream of
his return. Every morning and after the dawn prayer, Abu Mohammed
goes on with the rest of his morning rituals. The ritual consists
of cleaning his old rifle and checking every single bullet in
his tattered bag. Even though the man was forced many years ago
to live in a refugee camp in Lebanon known as Ein El-Hilweh, Abu
Mohammed never pictured life without Palestine.</P>

<P>The word &quot;refugee&quot; is often associated with Palestinians.
Not only because of their large number scattered throughout the
world, but also owing to the length of time that their dispossession
is taking. The link is so popular to the extent that the word
&quot;Palestinian&quot; has found it's way into the local Cuban
dialect. In Cuba, &quot;Palestinian&quot; means &quot;refugee&quot;.
Surviving through their prayers, the poetry of Mahmoud Darweesh
and by keeping their guns within reach, the Palestinian refugees
have always hoped for a better tomorrow. Experiencing the harshness
of homelessness and the difficulties of not being accepted into
foreign cultures, the return to Palestine became their only salvation.</P>

<P>Abu Mohammed's hope to return to his father's orchards and
his family's large house back in Palestine was seriously threatened
by the signing of the Oslo accords in September 1993. The Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon, who truly tasted the bitterness of life in
their camps, became almost an irrelevant issue at the negotiation
table. Feeling the sense of betrayal from their own leaders, some
Palestinians decided to take matters into their own hands. Samir
Maqdah, a dedicated Arafat supporter, announced immediately after
the signing his separation from Fateh. Maqdah decided that he
would continue to fight with no compromise.</P>

<P>The Lebanese Government was convinced that Arafat's fighters
were the main reason for Lebanon's 15 years of civil war. As a
result, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees were forced
to live within the boundaries of their inhumane and unimproved
refugee camps. Some of these camps were never repaired after their
near-complete destruction by Israeli forces in 1982. Many of the
buildings in these camps are half gone. Yet they continue to stand,
and the refugees did not abandon them. Simply they were not permitted
to fix them and they were not permitted to go somewhere else.</P>

<P>No one doubts that almost all Palestinians have paid the heavy
price of Israel's occupation. Most of them suffered and most of
them shared the hunger and pain at one point or another. But not
all of them were denied the right to return. Not all of them were
singled out to be discussed as a bargaining tool at the final
status negotiations.</P>

<P>It became regular news and almost undisturbing to hear about
the killing and wounding of Palestinians in South Lebanon. The
issue became such a daily routine that news anchors occasionally
forgot to express the events with sympathy on their faces. For
the refugees in the 13 Palestinian camps, the news is a daily
horror that they must undertake once an Israeli General decides
so. Once his decision to wreak havoc is made, neither children
nor women nor animals are protected. These refugees were failed
by virtually everyone. They are still as threatened and vulnerable
as ever. They are &quot;The Forgotten&quot; who can never forget.
They will always remember their homeland that they miss dearly.
Until that blessed day of return, Abu Mohammed will faithfully
continue polishing the old rifle, and will tell the long, sad
story to his grandsons, lest they forget.</P>
