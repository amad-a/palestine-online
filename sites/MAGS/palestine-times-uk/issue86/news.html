<H3><CENTER>PA says talks with Israel produced nothing</CENTER></H3>

<P>Occupied Jerusalem- After several meetings of direct talks
between PA and Israeli officials, held at the urging of U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat declared on Wednesday, 22 July, that talks with Israel
didn't achieve any results.</P>

<P>Arafat said the Palestinians would hold no more high-level
talks with the Israelis following the failure of the 19 July meeting
between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Yasser
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.</P>

<P>PA spokesman Nabil Abu Rudiena said the talks with Israel were
going nowhere, adding that Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu
was only seeking to &quot;sell old wine in new bottles.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So far, the Israelis have shown no signs of accepting
the American initiative,&quot; said Abu Rudiena.</P>

<P>The Palestinian official added that Mahmoud Abbas would not
hold another meeting with Mordechai owing to continuing Israeli
intransigence.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the Israeli Defense Minister called on the American
Administration to dispatch a high-ranking American diplomat to
try to bridge the gaps between Israel and the PA.</P>

<P>Mordechai said American intervention was needed owing to the
PA refusal to accept recent Israeli proposals concerning the implementation
of the second phase of Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank.</P>

<P>Described by the Palestinians as a &quot;take it or leave it&quot;
offer, the said proposals suggest that the Israeli occupation
army pulls out from 10% of the West Bank while the remaining 3%
stipulated in the American initiative be turned into a natural
reserve off limits to demographic expansion.</P>

<P>Mordechai said, &quot;It was imperative that Dennis Ross or
somebody else come to the area and strive to achieve something
in a very short period of time.&quot;</P>

<P>However, State Department spokesperson, James Robin, reacted
negatively to Mordechai's call saying, &quot;It was up to the
parties to solve their differences ... and the United States would
intervene if and when the parties achieved meaningful progress
in their direct talks.&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Netanyahu was coming under pressure to conclude
an agreement with the Palestinians before the end of July.</P>

<P>According to Israeli sources, the leader of the Third Way party,
Avigodor Kahalani, threatened to leave the Netanyahu Government
if an agreement with the Palestinians was not reached before the
end of July.</P>

<P>Moreover, two other coalition partners also threatened to topple
the Netanyahu Government if Netanyahu accepted the American initiative
(e.g. agreeing to redeploy from 13% of the West Bank).</P>

<P>The two parties are the Mifdal (National Religious Party) and
Tsomet whose support is vital for the survival of the Israeli
Government.</P>

<P>Israeli sources said Netanyahu might well seek a way out of
the current deadlock by dissolving the Knesset and calling for
early general elections, which he hopes to win.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Fatah says American initiative is &quot;filthy trap&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (25 July)</B><BR>
 Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction has lambasted Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat for &quot;dragging his feet&quot; and &quot;procrastinating&quot;
on the formation of the new PA cabinet.</P>

<P>In a leaflet distributed on Friday 24 July, the organization
accused Arafat of &quot;placing the vital interests of our people
in the hands of Benyamin Netanyahu.&quot;</P>

<P>The leaflet pointed out that the PA was &quot;in a state of
paralysis and seems to be utterly powerless to extract the Palestinian
cause from the political dead-end it was forced to following the
election of Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel.&quot;</P>

<P>The leaflet also questioned the real reasons behind Arafat's
reluctance to form a new cabinet that would win the support of
the Legislative Council and the Palestinian people as a whole.</P>

<P>Arafat has postponed several times naming a new cabinet, claiming
the task needed more consultations.</P>

<P>The leaflet is seen as a sign of discontent within the rank
and file of young Fatah activists due to the stagnation of the
peace process and the widespread corruption permeating throughout
PA institutions. </P>

<P>Meanwhile,  Islamist opposition figures  and legislative council
members accused the PA leadership of &quot;deliberately suspending
 local and municipal elections due to diminishing support for
Oslo among the Palestinian people.&quot;</P>

<P>Sheikh Jamal Salim, an Islamist leader from the Nablus area,
described as &quot;nonsense&quot; PA claims that the postponement
of the elections was being impeded by the Israeli occupation authorities.</P>

<P>&quot;The real reason behind the freezing of the election is
PA fear of the results,&quot; said Salim.</P>

<P>He pointed out that &quot;the head of the Preventive Security
Force in Gaza, Muhammed Dahlan issued last year a secret recommendation
to Yasser Arafat suggesting that the elections be canceled lest
the opposition scores a sounding victory which would send the
wrong message to our people and the world.&quot;</P>

<P>More to the point, Salim argued that Arafat himself and the
legislative council were elected in the shadow of the Israeli
occupation, adding that the PA was only looking for a pretext
to freeze the democratic process awaiting &quot;a certain political
achievement&quot; that would be used to enhance Arafat's image.</P>

<P>&quot;This is a flagrant example of opportunism and anti-democracy,&quot;
he said.</P>

<P>Husam Khader, an independent-minded Fatah councilor,  also
lashed out at the PA for &quot;seeking to confiscate the people's
choice.&quot;</P>

<P>He pointed out that the Legislative Council adopted a unanimous
decision to organize local and municipal elections.<BR>
He added however, that Arafat utterly ignored the decision for
&quot;personal political calculations.&quot; </P>

<P><B><U>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</U></B><BR>
 The Oslo peace process has effectively transformed major Palestinian
population centres in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip into &quot;isolated
Bantustans&quot;; this is the conclusion reached by three Palestinian
political figures who spoke during a seminar organized by the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Tulkarm on
22 July.</P>

<P>Ali al Jarbawi, Professor of Political Science at Bir Zeit
University said, &quot;the automatic extension&quot; of the &quot;transitional
period&quot; would only perpetuate the present &quot;tragic situation&quot;
in the occupied territories where the Israeli occupation completely
controls our life and land.</P>

<P>Jarbawi opined that there are several indications suggesting
that the Palestinian Authority will eventually agree to extend
the transitional period (due to expire in May 1999), despite its
recurrent threats to declare the formal establishment of a Palestinian
State by May of 1999.</P>

<P>&quot;The threats to proclaim a Palestinian State as of May
1999 is largely rhetorical and meant only to exert pressure on
Israel to redeploy its troops from a larger chunk of the West
Bank.&quot;</P>

<P>Jarbawi said the unilateral proclamation of a Palestinian State
by PA Chairman Yasser Arafat would have mainly a psychological
effect but would have very little affect on the situation on the
ground.</P>

<P>&quot;In a certain sense, Benyamin Netanyahu would be glad
to give Arafat 10% or 51% of Palestine and call it a Palestinian
State...even Israel would recognize a State as such.&quot;</P>

<P>Jarbawi described the continual rounds of talks between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority as &quot;without substance and a
waste of time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;These talks have produced nothing and contribute only
to lowering further the ceiling of Palestinian demands and expectations.&quot;</P>

<P>Another participant, Taysir Khalid of the DFLP, pointed out
that the Palestinian people were facing three choices: continuous
futile talks with Israel without a time-limit, conclusion of an
agreement with the Israelis before the end of the transitional
period, and, third, proclaiming a Palestinian State.</P>

<P>Khalid opined that the last choice was the safest way out of
the Oslo predicament, suggesting, however, that proclaiming a
State was one thing and establishing a viable State was quite
a different matter.</P>

<P>The DFLP official suggested that the PA immediately enter into
a serious dialogue with populist forces in the occupied territories
in Palestine and the diaspora for the purpose of reaching a &quot;common
approach concerning the paramount issue of Statehood.&quot;</P>

<P>Khalid urged the PA to immediately terminate all forms of normalization
with the enemy &quot;because others won't come to our aide when
they see us in a business-as-usual situation with the Israelis.&quot;</P>

<P>For his part, Khalil al Shekaki, Director of the Nablus-based
Palestinian Studies and Research Center, opined that the slated
proclamation of a Palestinian State by May of 1999 was the only
viable choice available.</P>

<P>However, Shekaki warned that in order for that proclamation
to be successful, the PA must put the Palestinian house in order,
as well as launch a relentless campaign aimed at acquiring international
recognition.</P>

<P>Shekaki, brother of the late Islamic Jihad leader Fathi al
Shekaki who was assassinated in Malta by Mossad agents three years
ago, warned that the price for Statehood would be immense.</P>

<P>He pointed out that the Israeli occupation authorities would
seek to annex large areas of the West Bank as well as &quot;close
off Palestinian population centres ... and might even reoccupy
the autonomous enclaves completely.&quot;<BR>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Hamas says Israeli account of &quot;foiled
bomb attack&quot; is nonsense</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (20 July) </B></P>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has vehemently denied
Israeli claims that a former Hamas activist was planning to carry
out a car-bomb attack in West Jerusalem on 19 July, describing
Israeli claims to that effect as &quot;sheer nonsense.&quot;</P>

<P>The Islamist source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed
that Jalal Rummaneh, the person the Israeli authorities allege
was planning to blow up his car in a crowded West Jerusalem street,
was in fact a construction contractor carrying several plastic
containers of diesel fuel for his concrete mixers.</P>

<P>&quot;You certainly don't use diesel oil when you plan to carry
out a bomb attack,&quot; said the source.</P>

<P>The PA also cast doubt on the &quot;car-bomb theory.&quot;</P>

<P>Nabil Abu Rudiena, spokesman for the PA Chairman, said in a
radio interview on 20 July, &quot;I believe the whole story is
concocted by the Israelis.&quot;</P>

<P>Abu Rudiena also accused the Israelis of &quot;spreading misinformation
on the eve of the resumption of talks between Israel and the PA
for the purpose of blackmailing the PA into giving more concessions.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There is something suspicious about this incident; the
Israelis know that the 'car-bomb story' is a fabrication.&quot;</P>

<P>So far, Israeli police have not produced any credible evidence
corroborating the claim that a car-bomb attack was being carried
out, aside from the allegation that the driver was associated
with Hamas in the past and that he entered Jerusalem without a
valid permit.</P>

<P>Moreover, the Israeli authorities, which imposed a blackout
on the investigation into the incident, never claimed that &quot;explosives&quot;
were found inside the car.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Israeli police were put on high alert to thwart
any possible attacks by Islamist guerrillas following the incident
in West Jerusalem on 19 July.</P>

<P>Moreover, Israeli soldiers carried out meticulous random searches
of cars and urged Israelis to inform the police of any suspicious
objects.</P>

<P>The new measures caused widespread traffic jams throughout
pre-1967 Palestine.<BR>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Amnesty: Israel's report to UN Committee fails<BR>
to address abuses in Occupied Territories</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>London- PT</B><BR>
Amnesty International expressed its concern to the UN Human Rights
Committee about a wide range of human rights violations, including
extrajudicial executions , torture , arbitrary detention and unfair
trials , committed by Israel. </P>

<P>Last month the Israeli Government presented its first report
-- long overdue -- to the Committee. The report describes how
Israel is implementing the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR). Members will question the Israeli delegation
and make concluding observations. </P>

<P>A statement by Amnesty pointed out that &quot;Israel's report
to the Committee fails to discuss the human rights situation in
the Occupied Territories -- the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, South
Lebanon and the Golan Heights - even though Israel is also bound
to apply the ICCPR in these areas, as well as in Israel.&quot;
</P>

<P>Amnesty criticised Israel because it failed to address in its
report to the Human Rights Committee the implementation of the
Covenant in the territories which it occupies, especially given
the scale and seriousness of the human rights violations perpetrated
against their populations. </P>

<P>Amnesty International requested that the Committee asks Israel
to submit a supplementary report on the implementation of the
Covenant in the Occupied Territories. The human rights organisation
also asked the Committee to make strong recommendations to the
Israeli Government on how it can fully implement the ICCPR. </P>

<P>Amnesty International's concerns, expressed in a memorandum
to the Committee, include: </P>

<P>Extrajudicial killings and unlawful killings: With flagrant
disrespect for the right to life, the use of extrajudicial executions
to combat &quot;terrorism&quot; appears official policy for the
Israel Government. Additionally, each year the Israeli security
forces shoot dead dozens of Palestinians, frequently using excessive
force and even violating the Israeli army's own Open Fire Regulations.
</P>

<P>Torture and ill-treatment: Secret official guidelines authorize
the General Security Service (GSS) to employ torture and ill-treatment
during interrogations. The GSS uses sensory deprivation methods,
position abuse and violent shaking systematically. </P>

<P>Torture is not only official policy, it is effectively legalized:
Israel's Supreme Court has, until now, failed to give legal protection
to detainees subjected to such methods. In Khiam Detention Centre,
a prison in South Lebanon run by the South Lebanon Army (SLA),
Israel's proxy militia in the area, in cooperation with Israel,
Lebanese detainees are also systematically tortured. </P>

<P>Arbitrary detention: Israel currently holds about 90 Palestinians
in arbitrary detention without charge or trial as &quot;administrative
detainees&quot;. In addition, it holds 21 Lebanese nationals in
administrative detention as hostages in return for information
about Israeli soldiers missing in action in Lebanon. In November
1997 the Israeli Supreme Court held that it was legal to hold
these detainees as &quot;bargaining chips&quot;. </P>

<P>The Israeli army and the SLA illegally arrest Lebanese nationals
in South Lebanon, taking them either to Khiam Detention Centre
or, occasionally, to Israel. About 100<BR>
Lebanese detainees, including children, are imprisoned in Khiam,
which operates completely outside any legal framework. None has
been charged or put on trial. Some<BR>
detainees have been held in this condition since 1985. </P>

<P> Unfair trials: Palestinian detainees receive unfair trials
in the military courts set up by Israel for the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip. Convictions are almost invariably based exclusively
on the accused's confession, usually extracted by the use of torture
and ill-treatment. It appears to Amnesty International that there
is a presumption of guilt rather than innocence in these courts.
</P>

<P> The UN Human Rights Committee is a body of 18 experts elected
by the States Parties to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights to monitor the way these states implement their
obligations set out in the Covenant. Israel ratified the Covenant
in 1991. The experts act in their personal capacity and do not
represent their government. The experts regularly review written
reports from states on how the Covenant has been implemented by
questioning government representatives and issuing written conclusions.</P>

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>ISRAEL: Endless Human Rights Violations</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>Amman- Special to PT</B><BR>
For two days there was extensive debate over Israel's second periodic
report to the Committee against Torture convening in Geneva, wherein
the Committee identified a range of interrogation methods used
by Israel that violate article16 and constitute torture as defined
by article 1 of the Convention.  The Human Rights Watch, in a
memorandum submitted to the Committee, noted that &quot;Despite
the Committee's repeated recommendations of concrete steps Israel
should take to bring its laws and practices into compliance, Israel
has consistently disregarded these recommendations and continues
to use torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during
interrogations of Palestinian detainees&quot;.</P>

<P>The Israeli record, which is full of gross human rights violations
despite the wide international condemnation of its practices towards
the Palestinians, will be filling up with even more violations
since &quot;Israel is currently considering legislation that would
give legal cover to secret interrogation procedures&quot;, including
those already identified by the Committee as being in violation
of the Convention. A recent draft of the General Security Services
(GSS) Law allows the adoption of secret guidelines for interrogation,
and grants GSS agents immunity from criminal liability if they
are acting &quot;in good faith and in a reasonable manner in the
course of carrying out their duties.&quot; The bill also makes
it a criminal offense for any member of the GSS or its Knesset
overseer committee to disclose information without authorization.
If enacted, this bill would provide a legal basis for the use
of &quot;moderate measures of physical pressure&quot; by GSS agents
during interrogations-including practices already recognized by
the Convention as constituting violations of article 16 and amounting
to torture as defined in article 1.</P>

<P>Of course, it goes beyond mentioning that &quot;this trend
toward expanding immunity from prosecution for abuses committed
by the State is also evident in Israel's draft Law Concerning
Handling of Suits Arising from Security Force Activities in Judea,
Samaria and the Gaza Strip. The law would severely limit the right
of Palestinians to seek compensation for wrongful injury or death
caused by Israeli soldiers. The legislation would disqualify most
suits by unduly broadening the definition of &quot;combatant activity&quot;-situations
for which no compensation could be claimed-and by exempting from
consideration injuries that are not serious and permanent. If
enacted, this law would eviscerate what has been one of the few
means of holding the Israeli army accountable for abuses: civil
suits in Israeli courts.</P>

<P>One of the main issues that drew a lot of controversy, being
described as inhuman and unjust, was &quot;Israel's use of prolonged
administrative detention and hostage-taking&quot; since people
should never be used as bargaining chips. Under administrative
detention, detainees are held without charge or trial, sometimes
for years at a time.  According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;Although
Israel recently released some of the longest held administrative
detainees, including Ahmad Qattamesh, who was held for almost
six years without charge, an estimated 150 individuals remain
in custody&quot;.  It also stated that &quot;Israel admitted for
the first time in 1997 that it used administrative detention to
hold Lebanese nationals as hostages to secure the release of Israeli
servicemen.&quot;</P>

<P>Despite the Oslo accords signed by Israel, which should have
enhanced its respect for the rights of Palestinians, Israel is
still acting in a manner very much in contradiction to its alleged
pursuit for peace and coexistence.</P>

<P>It is evident that Israel is not willing to uphold a commitment
to honour or respect the rights of the Palestinians, let alone
giving them any of their legal rights. Its attitude as such has
caused a volatile atmosphere, one that is ready to explode at
the slightest friction. </P>

<P><CENTER><A NAME="7"></A><A HREF="#100">Top</A><B><BIG><BR>
<HR>Hamas urges PA to release political prisoners</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<P>The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has called on the Palestinian
Authority to release all Hamas leaders and supporters detained
in the PA jails, namely Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi, Dr. Ibrahim Maqadmeh
and Emad Awadhallah, who were detained following the assassination
of Hamas military leader Muhiel Deen Sharif. </P>

<P>A communiqu&eacute; issued by Hamas referred to the report
on the results of the investigation made by the PA's Legislative
Council on the assassination of Sharif as &quot;a diplomatic ploy
adopted by the investigation committee in order not to condemn
the self-rule authority for hastening to fabricate charges against
Hamas members.&quot; The committee formed by the Legislative Council
last April to investigate the assassination of the Hamas military
leader concluded that the PA had no sufficient evidence proving
its accusations against Hamas members. It also stressed the necessity
to release all Hamas prisoners detained by the PA because of the
assassination. </P>

<P>&quot;We, in Hamas, stress that the Zionist Enemy is responsible
for this crime, along with the involvement of some PA security
bodies who implemented the crime. They are influential parties
who seek to get away from the consequences of the crime by all
means,&quot; Hamas said.</P>

<P>Hamas pointed out that its members in the PA detention places
are subject to continuous physical and psychological torture in
order to be forced to admit to a crime they never committed or
to provide interrogators with information leading to the arrest
or liquidation of Adel Awadhallah, a prominent military leader
of Hamas. </P>

<P>&quot;We appeal to all free people of this nation to intervene
in order to put an end to the arbitrary practices of the PA's
security bodies. We also believe that it is time to open all detention
places and free the Palestinian hostages in the PA jails, especially
after the PA proved unable to regain the legitimate rights of
the Palestinian People. Its security conduct has proved that it
preserves the security of the Israeli occupation instead of protecting
the security of the Palestinian People, while Jerusalem is being
Judaized and the American sponsor (of peace) proved to be biased
to the Zionists,&quot; Hamas concluded.</P>

<P><B>Gaza -</B> Palestinian and Arab prisoners in the Israeli
desert jail said the Israeli jail authority escalated its arbitrary
measures against them. In a letter they sent to the Palestinian
Prisoners and Freed Detainees Society, prisoners revealed that
they live in seriously poor living conditions including, but not
limited to, overcrowding, poor ventilation, lack of proper health
care, and mass punishment. They added that one of their inmates,
Martyr Yousef Ar'eer, died last month owing to the absence of
proper medical care in the jail. The prisoners said they decided
