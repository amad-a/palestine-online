<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority released on 19 December six of the eight
political activists arrested for three weeks for co-signing what has come to be known as
&#147;Petition-20&#148;, which accused Yasser Arafat&#146;s regime of widespread graft and
corruption and of betraying the trust of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the released are either prominent members of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), namely Ahmed Qatamesh, or generally associated with
the Palestinian Left. Hence, their release which was ordered by Arafat may have been
linked to the Palestinian leader&#146;s efforts to co-opt the PFLP to the Oslo process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two activists remaining in jail are Ahmed Dudin of Dura, a veteran
Fatah activist, and Abdul Sattar Qasem, Professor of Political Science at the Najah
National University in Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two have adamantly refused to recant the Petition or, indeed, ask for
forgiveness from Arafat. Instead, they retorted to a virulent campaign against them
carried out by the PA media, arguing that they were merely reflecting the sentiments of
the Palestinian masses and had nothing to regret or apologize for.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dudin, who had spent many months of administrative detention in the
Israeli desert detention centre at Ketseot in the Negev, was even more defiant. He told
the Qatari satellite television al-Jazira on 10 December that it was shameful that the PA
resorted to punishing the petitioners instead of punishing the &#147;the lords of
corruption&#148; who &#147;were corroding our country from within.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He described PA accusations that the petitioners were acting on behalf of
&#147;outside powers&#148;&#151;a clear allusion to Syria&#151;as &#147;brash lies&#148;,
saying &#147;it seems that one can no longer criticize morbid phenomena in society without
being accused of being an agent for a foreign power.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likewise, Qasem, an outspoken critic of Arafat and author of a book
entitled, <i>Oslo: the Road to Disaster</i> (banned by the PA), refused to plead for mercy
from Arafat, saying he preferred to stay in jail rather than &#147;betray his
conscience.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qasem, himself a former supporter of the PLO, was the target of an
assassination attempt by Fatah activists in 1994, ostensibly after he made scathing
criticisms of the Oslo process and Arafat&#146;s leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The imprisoned signatories of Petition-20 were earlier threatened with
prosecution before the so-called State Security Court (SSC), founded by Arafat in 1995 at
Yitzhak Rabin&#146;s insistence mainly to try and punish Palestinian critics of the Oslo
process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it seemed that Arafat opted not to go that far, probably after he
had received recommendations from his advisors and probably from the Americans as well,
that a draconian measure such as trying the eight critics before the SSC would ultimately
further tarnish the image of the PA and its ruinous justice system. It remains to be said
that the incarceration of the eight activists was ordered by the President with little, if
any, intervention from the judicial system. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, more than one PA official referred to the imprisoned activists as
&#147;<i>mutakalin ala themat al Ra&#146;is</i>&#148; or &#147; prisoners detained by
orders of the President.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Decision to release political prisoners has ulterior motive</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat&#146;s decision to release the six co-signers of the petition,
along with the possible release of Dudin and Qasem probably before the end of Ramadan,
does not mean, however, that the PA President is becoming less intolerant of political
dissent, however peaceful that may be.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the opposite is true. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Palestinian Human Rights monitoring Group (PHRMG), press
censorship became tougher than usual and PA tolerance of freedom of speech was growing
thinner than ever.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This took the form of refusing to allow newspapers to publish views
defending the petitioners, even as &#147;letters to the editor,&#148; or replies to PA
writers and columnists parroting the regime&#146;s official line. Likewise, the PA-run
radio and television continued to heap calumnies on &#147;the advocates of division and
tumult,&#148; accusing them of &#147;playing into the hands of the enemies of our people
and of confusing the people at this crucial juncture of our struggle.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, on many occasions PA police confiscated tapes from cameramen
and violently suppressed pro-freedom demonstrations in Nablus, Ramallah and Bethlehem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, the most disturbing after-effect of Petition-20 was the
recurrence of physical attacks on figures deemed disloyal to Arafat or too outspoken
against his autocracy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 16 December, members of the General Intelligence (GI) badly beat Abdul
Jawad Saleh, one of the signatories to the Petition, as he sought to visit the imprisoned
petitioners in a Jericho jail. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Saleh, 66, reportedly was dragged off and beaten in utter disregard for
his parliamentary immunity. He suffered bruises and cuts on the face and a resulting
nosebleed, which required a brief hospitalization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The incident, condemned by the powerless councillors, but utterly ignored
by Arafat and the PA-run media, was widely viewed as a warning by Arafat to the
&#147;rowdy lawmakers&#148; against going too far in opposing the President.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The next day, a human rights activist at Beir Zeit University, Hanan
Maseou, sustained moderate injuries after she was assaulted by &#147;unknown
elements.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maseou, who is also in charge of a human rights programme at the
University, reportedly found a written note pasted on one of the stones pelted at here,
warning her against continuing to raise human rights violations against the PA enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this month, on 2 December, Moawiya al-Masri, one of the PLC
members who signed Petition-20, was shot in the legs by several masked men armed with
pistols and daggers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the three incidents, the perpetrators were not arrested, raising
suggestions that somebody from the PA security agencies was responsible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is difficult to say for sure if the three incidents, ominous as they
are, represent an advance harbinger for a looming reign of terror, or just reflecting
nervousness on the part of the increasingly beleaguered Palestinian leader. The coming
weeks and months will only tell. In any case, however, Arafat cannot be given the benefit
of the doubt. Last week, Palestinian sources identified with Fatah intimated to (PT) that
Arafat stunned senior cadres of the movement, whom he met in Ramallah recently, when he
said that the Palestinian people &#147;understood only the language of the stick.&#148;
Arafat reportedly uttered these words when Marwan Kanafani (PLC member and Head of Fatah
regional committees in the West Bank) asked him to release from jail the signatories of
Petition-20.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PLO council meeting with PA postponed</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority decided on 18 December to postpone
until mid-January a crucial PLO Central Council meeting, which will take place on 25
December.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The meeting was scheduled to discuss the declaration of Palestinian
Statehood in light of the current impasse on the Palestinian-Israeli track.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A PA communiqu� said the postponement was necessary in light of the
&#147;murky political situation&#148; surrounding the prospects of negotiations with
Israel on both the interim phase and final status talk levels.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The decision to postpone the meeting, which PA officials had said it would
be decisive on the issue of Statehood, was probably taken because Arafat did not want to
sustain another &#147;Statehood-declaration fiasco,&#148; particularly given the fact that
an increasing number of PLO officials, who are utterly disenchanted by Israeli
procrastination and intransigence, seem to be set on declaring Statehood now.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Democracy &#147;Flunks&#148; a
Consequential Test</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
</b><i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></i><strong>By Ramzy Baroud</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every democratic experience has its moments of triumph and failure.
Although we should be wary not to judge an entire experience based on one or two
occurrences, we must not overlook those experiences that could serve as a tool to
determine the success or failure of any democracy around the world. The recent Palestinian
quarrel following the distribution of an anti-corruption leaflet is considered to be one
of the Palestinian democracy&#146;s greatest challenges since the signing of Oslo in 1993.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The importance of the leaflet incident is drawn from the fact that Arafat
himself was the target of the signers&#146; criticism. Although PA president Yasser
Arafat&#146;s publicity throughout Palestine can hardly be denied, a legitimate democracy
ought to open the stage for criticism, regardless of the position held by the scrutinized
figure and regardless of the level of his popularity. Unfortunately, the PA&#146;s swift
reaction against those who chose to sign the leaflet failed to provide such legitimacy to
the Palestinian democracy. Even though it is hasty to conclude that Palestinian democracy
has failed, it is crucial to acknowledge its failure in meeting a vital provision in any
truthful democracy, that being freedom of speech.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The manifesto was incitement that went beyond the right of free
speech&#148;, Nabil Amr, a senior Arafat advisor, told the press while the issue was still
developing. Mr. Amr justified this declaration stating that &#147;the timing is
sensitive&#148;. Official Palestinian views are themselves alarming and ought to be
reconsidered. First, the statement assumes that there is a boundary that constrains and
limits freedom of speech. If such a boundary exists, who should be the one to determine
its limits? From the hasty arrests that were made of those who signed the leaflet, the PA
took it upon itself to ultimately determine what &#147;exceeds&#148; and what stays within
the limits of freedom of speech. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Secondly, justifying any crackdown on freedom of speech, democracy and
those who promote these rights by simply stating that &#147;the timing is sensitive&#148;
should be rejected, as every period in the Palestinian struggle has been both sensitive
and consequential. To accept Mr. Amr&#146;s argument is simply to accept the disablement
of the Palestinian democratic struggle for many years to come. Truthfully, there is no
proof that freedom of speech has ever hindered any nation in its struggle to achieve
liberation and obtain sovereignty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My argument should not be understood as an approval of the content within
the leaflet signed by 11 Palestinian intellectuals and 9 lawmakers. The argument is,
however, that real democracy neither places anyone above the law nor eliminates those who
dare to speak out, even if we assume the contortion of their logic. Democracy is about
honesty, openness and self-determination. If every Palestinian feels that being honest
will jeopardize his freedom, safety and perhaps livelihood, few are those who may risk
speaking out in the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statements made within the infamous leaflet were an expression of
opinion. Their stand neither contained an act of treason nor a threat to Palestinian
national unity. Those who signed it were well-known and respected Palestinian academics
and activists. The fact that the document was presented by a considerable number of local
leaders within Palestinian society indicates that their views must have been shared by
some if not many Palestinians. The matter, therefore, is alarming and must be followed
with deep examination. If corruption truly exists within the PA, the silencing of those
who defied that corruption shall hinder the facts from surfacing. On the other hand, if no
corruption is in fact taking place, the reaction of the PA against those who made such
claims has weakened the PA&#146;s stand and has strengthened the position asserted within
the leaflet.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead of arresting and defaming those who made the allegations, the PA
should have worked hand in hand with its opposition to find the truth, regardless of whom
the truth pleases or whom it disturbs. Otherwise, the PA should have simply defended its
policy and conduct and left the matter for the Palestinian people to decide for
themselves. The feelings of endearment, which many Palestinians hold for PA President
Yasser Arafat, must not violate the right of other fellow Palestinians to see Arafat
within a different scope. Such a question contains, in fact, the true essence and meaning
of democracy. If that fundamental quality in the democratic experience is diminished, what
remains is a mere imitation of democracy, with no validity and with little efficiency.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though the latest Palestinian dispute has proved that the current state of
democracy in Palestine is in an unsatisfactory condition, the finding itself was truly
valuable, for Palestinians are now more aware of their weaknesses than ever before. With
that realization in mind, a tough task faces Palestinians in the coming years&#151;the
task of shaping their democratic experience to satisfy the needs of all, not only the
needs of those who govern.</p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></i>By E. Yaghi</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Abdel Jawad and I am a 69-year-old Palestinian lawmaker living
in the West Bank. On Thursday, 16 December, I was released from the hospital after
treatment I received for being severely beaten by Palestinian police. The reason for my
brutal beating was because I signed a manifesto holding Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat guilty of government corruption. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My beating took place after I joined a peaceful protest outside a jail in
the West Bank town of Jericho, where three intellectuals who also signed the same
manifesto were being held without trial or charges. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Plainclothes policemen asked me to enter the prison compound and locked me
inside a room where they severely beat me. Six or seven so-called &#147;security&#148;
people started beating me, then they threw water on me and tossed me in the street. I
collapsed and was taken by fellow demonstrators to the hospital. My body bears proof of
the severity of my beating. I have bandages on my nose and right leg, am covered with
bruises and also have lash marks on my arms and legs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am not a criminal; I am not a renegade. I am a lawmaker who was
separated from my family for the greater part of my life. My children were raised alone by
their mother and grew up without me. For a long time, the only contact I had with my wife
and children was by phone because I was deported from my home by the Israelis to a
neighbouring Arab country for speaking out against all the oppression and tyranny that my
people suffered under the invaders&#146; occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I could almost understand my deportation and that I was considered a
threat (intellectual at that) by those people who had swept into Palestine and had taken
my land away from me. But I cannot understand at all how members of the Palestine
Authority could arrest me, beat me and throw me in the street for speaking out against the
corruption of Yasser Arafat and some of his gang. They do not represent freedom and
justice. They are merely a puppet regime acting as agents for their Israeli counterparts. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There have been corruption charges leveled against the Palestine Authority
in the past, but allegations focused mainly on Cabinet ministers and never on Mr.
President himself. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But my President, noble and kind as he is, lips trembling when he speaks
and all, responded swiftly, arresting 11 of the signatories and threatening to lift the
immunity from the rest of us unless we lawmakers retract our statements. Of course, we
refused to do this. It is a matter of conscience and doing what is right. We stand for
justice and legality. We cannot condone corruption, especially from the head of our
dwindling disappearing country which now suffers under a double occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this month, signatory Mwawya al-Masri, also a lawmaker, was shot
in the leg by three hooded thugs outside his Nablus home. Al-Masri later confided to me
that plainclothes Palestinian police shot him as punishment for signing the manifesto. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I leave it up to you, the readers, to decide the charges of corruption
leveled against the single man who at one time was a symbol of what all Palestinians
fought for and believed in. As far as I am concerned, he is a traitor to the very things
that he once symbolized. I rest my case.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;War on children&#148; is both an invention and legacy of the
twentieth century. During the last decade, more than 1.5 million children have been killed
in wars. Palestinian children have not been exempted from this scourge. Three percent of
them under the age of 15 are disabled. Over 22,000 were injured by live ammunition during
the 1987-1993 <b>Intifadah</b>. Although they now constitute over 50 percent of their own
population, the suffering of Palestinian children under the age of 18 evoked no special
mention at the celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child in November1999. Hence, to commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of
the <b>Palestinian Revolution,</b> <b>Dr. Daud Abdullah</b>* dedicates:</p>

</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the monthly magazine Our Palestine first began to circulate
throughout the Arab world in late 1959, few readers took it seriously. Addressed
principally to &#145;The Children of the Catastrophe&#146;, its stated purpose was to
summon the Palestinian nation back to life. That life was, however, not an end in itself.
It was desired only insofar as it enabled the Palestinian people to regain their land,
freedom and dignity. New Year&#146;s Day 1965 witnessed one of the most significant
undertakings on this long road to national redemption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Military Communiqu� No.1, which was slipped into the offices of several
Beirut newspapers, announced the launch of armed operations inside the occupied
territories and, with them, the Palestinian Revolution. Although it did not overturn an
old regime in the classic manner as the Cuban Revolution, the Palestinian Revolution has,
unquestionably, inscribed permanent changes upon the political map of the Middle East. It
established Palestine as the key to a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And, while
securing for them the freedom to organize and engage in political activity, it also
restored Palestinian national pride and self-respect. Apathy, resignation and fear gave
way to self-confidence and a firm resolution not to be refugees or strangers in the
countries of others. One 18-year-old schoolboy spoke for the entire nation when he said,
&#147;The Revolution gave me the answer to who I am.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That being the case, there still remain other crucial questions that cry
out for answers. When will the long exile of the Palestinian people come to an end? When
will The Children of the Catastrophe enjoy, without let or hindrance, the rights embodied
in the 32 articles of the UN Convention? Furthermore, will the French for that matter ever
set up a commission to facilitate the compensation of Palestinian children orphaned during
the Nakba [Catastrophe] as their Justice Minister did last November for Jewish children
orphaned during the holocaust?! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite their enormous and persistent losses, Palestinian children have
yet given much to humanity. The images of the young stone-throwers being fired upon by
Israeli soldiers in 1988-1989 must have, in retrospect, hastened the proclamation of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Born for the most part after 1967, they have known
nothing but foreign military occupation, sieges and curfews in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip (WBGS). The result has been low educational achievements, a high dropout rate from
schools, economic exploitation and an imposed dependence upon Israel.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today&#146;s victims</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While they are being condemned to lives of misery and poverty in other
people&#146;s countries, Israeli settlers continue to grow rich with the land and property
of the evicted Palestinians. At a time when schools are forever in short supply in the
occupied territories, recreational facilities are virtually non-existent. In Bethlehem
where the Blessed Child was born 2,000 years ago, there is not a single playground today.
This, of course, is a crying shame and betrayal of civilized norms. It is disgraceful
because better can be done and it is a betrayal because it constitutes a denial of rights
affirmed in the November 1959 UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. They are the
rights to social security including adequate nutrition, housing, recreation, medical
services, and protection from neglect, cruelty and exploitation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first and most striking impression one gets upon arriving in the Gaza
Strip today is that it is a reservoir overflowing with children. Half of the one million
Palestinians there are below the age of 15. Many of them suffer from anxiety, depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder, stuttering, bed-wetting, insomnia, aggression and
diminished concentration. The worst affected children are those who witnessed their
fathers and elders being brutalized or whose homes were demolished. Despite its vaunted
credentials to democracy, human rights and peace, the Barak government ordered the
demolition of 70 Palestinian homes two days after signing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum
in October 1999. Thus, Palestinian children must still pay the heavy price so that Israel
can preserve its record of being the only country in the world that systematically
demolishes the homes of a section of its population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The policy of house demolitions and land confiscation has naturally taken
a heavy toll on Palestinian family life. Extended families are forced to live together in
overcrowded conditions. It is, therefore, quite common to find 30 people residing in 3
bedroom houses. The Guidance and Training Centre for the Child and the Family, which
provides counseling for residents of the West Bank and Jerusalem, confirmed that 80% of
its clients are victims of political oppression experienced both before and during the
Oslo peace process. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tomorrow&#146;s people</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That the future of every nation lies in the hands of its children is a
common truth that cannot be overstated. People of every race and creed invest invaluable
time and resources in their young, with the hope that their future will not only be
different but actually better than their past and present. While the challenges facing
Palestinian children are by no means insurmountable, they are certainly formidable.
Instead of being inspired by pleasurable childhood memories, they are slowed down and
impeded at every turn by the permanent psychological injuries they sustained during years
of confrontation with the occupier. Against this background, the British Member of
Parliament, Mr. Richard Burden, told a House of Commons debate (30/11/99) on the
Palestinian right to return that &#147;half the refugees are children, who are growing up
with an uncertain future.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As long as the clouds of political uncertainty continue to hang over the
WBGS, the rights of Palestinian children would remain constantly under threat. Yet, in the
present circumstances, there is no definite answer as to who is responsible for protecting
them. In theory, Article 22 of the Basic Law of Palestine states that: &#147;Motherhood,
childhood, the family, the young and the youth have the right to protection and to the
availability of proper opportunities for the development of talents.&#148; In reality,
though, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has only limited control over parts of the WBGS. It
does not have the full control over its borders that enables it to import medicine or
transfer patients abroad for treatment if need be. Since only States Parties can ratify
international conventions, the PA was only able to provide a verbal ratification of the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Therefore, until these matters of sovereignty,
borders and legislation are resolved, the rights of Palestinian children in the
territories will remain dead letters on paper. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meanwhile, there is much that the PA can do by itself to improve
the well-being of children and provide opportunities for the development of their talents.
One obvious area is the reorganization of national priorities. Having resigned itself to a
peaceful coexistence with the Jewish State, the PA cannot now by any stretch of the
imagination justify the allocation of 36% of its budget to security&#151;five times more
than is currently being spent on health, social services and education combined. Surely
the Children of the Catastrophe deserve better.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In hindsight, Camp Palestinians often give three causes for the
Revolution: the conquest of Palestine and the establishment of a racially exclusive State
in it; the dispersal of the Arab Palestinians from their homes; and the enduring tradition
of struggle to regain independence on their land. A school principal in Burj el-Barajneh
Camp in Lebanon recalled, &#147;When the Revolution came, those who reacted to it most
were students in the intermediate classes; they joined the Revolution, and supported
it.&#148;<sup>1</sup> As the schools became training camps, so too did the teacher-student
relationship change. Within a very short period, the former was called upon to interpret
political events, organize and provide direction for children who sought deliverance from
sinister attempts to bury their national existence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The politicization of The Children of the Catastrophe was neither limited
to a particular time nor locality. From the camps of the diaspora in the 1970s, this
consciousness was transferred to the occupied territories in the 1980s. Wherever they
were, The Children of the Catastrophe acquired a rare ability to see through attempts to
deceive and weaken them. In the WBGS, they realized that the beating of their fathers and
uncles was not simply to cause physical pain. They learned from bitter experience that the
real aim of the Israeli occupier is always to undermine the authority and position of
fathers in their families by humiliating them in front of their children, thereby
weakening the social fabric and cohesiveness of Palestinian society. Although the policy
did prove effective in some cases, it has, on the whole, failed to work entirely to the
advantage of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As it stands, the Jewish State has failed to change the widespread
perception of itself as an occupying power. Its growing campaign within the United Nations
to become a part of the West European regional group and recent attendance at the Istanbul
Summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have reinforced
Israel&#146;s image as a Western surrogate in the Arab world. When added to the incendiary
elements of political repression, economic deprivation and social exclusion, the question
is not if, but rather when will the next upheaval take place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having long shattered the barriers of fear, The Children of the
Catastrophe are, without doubt, Palestine&#146;s greatest asset. Tested and pushed to the
limits many times in the past, they have proven themselves stronger in some ways than
their heavily armed adversaries. Surely, &#147;It takes much more courage for a child
armed with stones to confront gun-toting troops than it does for those troops to confront
children.&#148;<sup>2</sup> Forgotten by many and remembered by few, they still symbolize
the life and destiny of the Palestinian nation.<i> </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></i>By Shaaban Abdel Rahman</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is dangerous in the scandals of corruption within the Palestinian
Authority is not the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars into the pockets of
the PA officials, but it is that we have discovered that this is an organization which
dedicates itself to sucking the blood of the Palestinian People and to denying them the
simplest of human rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This organization we are referring to is speaking on behalf of the
Palestinian People, negotiating on their behalf, and it is supposed, in the near future,
to sign the so-called final peace settlement of the Palestinian Cause with the Zionist
regime. Have those who failed in the &#147;honesty&#148; examination regarding some
million of dollars a right to be entrusted with resolving the most dangerous issue for the
Arabs and Muslims?!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other face of the picture exposes the reality behind enabling the
PA&#151;a trust given by all Arab parties concerned with the peace process&#151;to talk
and sign on behalf of the Palestinian People as their sole legitimate representative, even
though it has proven itself to be dishonest and without conscience. Can the United States,
which sponsors the peace process, and Israel find an easier entity to relinquish the
rights of the Palestinian People than the PA at present?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This time, the people who exposed the corruption and thefts within the
self-rule Authority were not from the Palestinian Opposition but from the PA itself, and
some of them are senior officials and very influential inside the Authority. This in
itself proves that the PA is deteriorating from within. However, further proof of the
PA&#146;s deterioration was clearly exhibited when Chairman Arafat got fed up with those
who distributed a leaflet (also known as Petition-20) exposing the PA&#146;s corruption
and consequently ordered the arrest of some of them, put some others under house arrest
and threatened to strip the members of the Legislative Council of their immunity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What we know is that serious and honest liberation movements should always
do their best to clean their ranks and to accept the self-criticism in order to obtain
credibility among their supporters and people. They should also use all means to be close
to their people in order to be strong against the enemy and strong round the table of
negotiations. But this is not the case with the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How can such an authority deal with the Zionist enemy and negotiate with
it while it is accused by its people of theft and embezzlement of more than $1 billion
from foreign contributions to the Palestinian People? It seems that the PA has not left
any of this money to its people!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is surprising that Arafat himself was accused by a member of the
Legislative Council and former minister, namely Abdel Jawad Saleh, of withdrawing $200
million from the PA&#146;s budget and depositing it into his secret accounts. He is also
accused by Jawid Ghusain, the former chief of the PLO&#146;s National Fund, of depositing
millions of PLO dollars into his secret accounts in Israeli banks!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Isn&#146;t this authority giving the Zionists a rare and historic chance
to do whatever they want regarding the Palestinian Question?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Can we also understand why all the evil powers are now allies in the bid
to get rid of Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The issue of normalcy most divides the Israeli right from the left. The
left longs for normalcy and wants Jews to be a nation like all other nations. The entire
Israeli right, on the other hand, is united in its resentment of the idea of normalcy and
its belief, along the lines of the Jewish religion<sub>5 </sub>that Jews are exceptional -
different from other people and nations. Reverence for the national past allegedly
solidifies this uniqueness. Religious Jews believe that God made the Jews unique3 many of
the secular right believe that Jews are doomed to be unique by their past and have no free
choice in this matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another, but somewhat less important<sub>3 </sub>reason for the affinity
between the secular right and religious Jews is that the latter are capable of providing
&quot;convincing&quot; arguments for perpetual Jewish rule over the land of Israel and for
the denial of certain basic rights to the Palestinians. These arguments are not only put
in terms of national security but more importantly in terms of the God-given right to
these territories. The secular Likud scholars and politicians are often far too alienated
from the Jewish past and Jewish values to talk competently, or indeed even to understand
properly, such matters. Only the religious can provide an in-depth rationale for Likud's
policies, which are grounded not in short-term strategic considerations but rather in the
long history of the special relationship between God and his chosen people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although far more intense among members of Israel B, these same sentiments
can be discerned among members of Israel A. This fact provides the explanation for the
political concessions made to the religions parties. (Foreign observers have too often
incorrectly attributed these concessions merely to the size and/or the lobbying power of
the religious parties.) These sentiments have also affected Jewish historiography and
education. Since the late 1950s, and especially after the 1967 war, Israeli Jewish
historians, scholars in allied fields and popularizers, although generally less dishonest
in their writings than most of their diaspora colleagues, have too often unduly beautified
and romanticized past Jewish societies and have carefully avoided normal criticism. This
type of apologia constituted a new trend. From the late nineteenth century until the
mid-twentieth century, early Zionists and others in modem Jewish movements were severely
critical of many aspects of their own religious cultural tradition and tried to change, in
many cases even to destroy, parts of that tradition. Since the late 1980s, some younger
Israeli historians, perhaps prompted by a growing polarization of Israeli Jewish society,
have written and published some critical works that have shaken to some extent the still
current apologetic trend.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The comparison of the world outlook and fears of the secular right with
those of the Haredim requires more explanation. Standard Haredic perceptions of the world
can only be understood as relics of pre-modern times. Menachem Friedman, a Westernized
observant Jew, a highly regarded authority on the Haredim in both mandatory Palestine and
the state of Israel and a professor at the religious Bar-Ilan University, provided an
excellent description of these Haredic perceptions in a <i>Davar </i>article published on
November 4, 1988. Friedman wrote this article to explain the electoral fiasco that
developed from the unsuccessful attempt of some candidates on the religious list of 1988
to advocate some moderation regarding the treatment of Palestinians. Friedman explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haredi world is Judeocentric. The essence of Haredi thought is the
  notion of an abyss separating the Jews from the Gentiles. This is why any coalition
  between Labor and Haredi doves is impossible. There actually is no such thing as a Haredi
  dove. People who speak about the Haredi world usually do not know how to read its signs.
  They do not understand that world nor its prominent personalities. The distance between
  Haredi doves and hawks is not great. Haredi doves and hawks share a common point of
  departure. Both see the relationship between non-Jews and Jews as they had seen them
  before Israel was established. They assume that non-Jews and Jews are poles apart.
  Non-Jews want to kill and destroy the Jews; the rightful differences between Jews should
  only be about how they should react to the ever-present non-Jewish desire. Currently,
  these are two alternative Haredi reactions to that common assumption. Rabbi Shach [the
  spiritual leader of one of the two Haredi factions] says that since the non-Jews hate us
  we need to keep quiet and refrain from provoking them by not reminding them of our
  existence. The Lubovitcher Rebbe says that we should be strong. [The Lubovitcher Rebbe<sub>,</sub>
  Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, died in 1992.] Those are two alternative answers, both arising
  from the common concept that a gap separates Jews from non-Jews. Rabbi Shach is not a dove
  in the same sense as Shulamit Aloni [a former Meretz Party leader] is a dove. Aloni is a
  dove, because she believes in a humanism that emphasizes the fundamental equality of all
  human beings and nations and the capability of different human beings and nations to
  communicate. Rabbi Shach believes that communicating with non-Jews is not possible and
  that they may only be able to forget that Jews exist. The Lubovitcher Rebbe states that we
  should be strong in order to defend ourselves against the non-Jews who always want to
  destroy us. [The difference between the two leaders] can be illustrated by their
  respective attitudes toward the peace [treaty] with Egypt. They both say that there is no
  peace and there can never be one<sub>,</sub> because the Egyptians want to exterminate us.
  Rabbi Shach, however, adds that we should try to minimize [Jewish casualties] by keeping
  quiet. The Lubovitcher Rebbe says that, because the peace does not exist in any case,<sub>
  </sub>we should refuse to make any concessions. The Haredi dove does not believe in any
  kind of peace, and,<sub> </sub>therefore, all the talk about a narrow coalition, headed by
  Labor [and including Haredim] is completely baseless. Subsequent political developments in
  Israel, including the election of Netanyahu in May 1996, have confirmed the truth of
  Professor Friedman's analysis. From another Haredi perspective Rabbi Ovadia Yoseph, the
  spiritual authority of the Shas Party, corroborated this article. Rabbi Yoseph arguedina
  September 18, 1989 article in <i>Yated Ne'eman </i>that since Israel is too weak to
  demolish all Christian churches in the Holy Land<i> </i>it is also too weak to retain all
  the conquered territories. Using this reasoning, Rabbi Yoseph advocated that Israel make
  territorial concessions in order to avert a war in which Jewish lives will be lost. Rabbi
  Yoseph did not mention Palestinians nor even their most rudimentary rights. The Haredi
  world view is similar to the view held by the Israeli secular right. The world view of
  Likud politicians, enthusiastically supported by followers, is basically the classic world
  view of religious Jews; it has undergone significant secularization but has kept its
  essential qualities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The alliance between the religious and secular parties of the right
produced the Netanyahu victory in the 1996 election. This alliance was forged in spite of
two deep political differences between the parties. The first difference concerns
democracy, especially as illustrated by the structure of Israeli parties; the second
difference revolves around Zionism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All Israeli political parties except for the Haredi were and remain
structured along the lines of parties in Western countries, especially those in the United
States. Most of the Israeli parties, for example, introduced primaries in order to choose
their candidates for the Knesset elections. The Haredi party structure, however, is
different and peculiar, perhaps analogous only to what has happened in Iran. All the
Haredi parties have a two-tier structure. The tier that is lower in importance includes
the acting politicians, who, even if they are ministers or Knesset members, humbly profess
in public that they are merely serving the party's rabbinical sage councils whom they
consult for directions before making any decisions. None of the Haredi politicians of any
one party accept direction from rabbinical councils of other Haredi parties. The councils'
deliberations are kept secret; their decisions are not subject to any appeal since they
are regarded as divinely inspired. The council members are not elected either by rabbis or
lay people. If a council member dies, his successor is appointed by the remaining members.
The rabbinical members of Haredi party councils, usually referred to by their followers as
sages, make all decisions and view with suspicion the usual party structure, because it is
viewed as innovative and modem. The modern political party structure, including
membership, branches, internal elections and a host of other items that exist in the NRP,
is totally absent in the Haredi parties. The disagreement and sometimes even hatreds of
one another by Haredi parties stern from recognition of different rabbinical
&quot;sages&quot; as final authorities. The Haredi political structure has preserved a
male monopoly. To date, there have been no female Haredi politicians. Haredi disunity has
prevented more rapid Haredization of pans of Israeli society. Structure similar to the
Haredi was common in Jewish communities from the second century of the common era until
the abolition of Jewish communal autonomy in modern nation states. The aim of Haredi
practices has been and still is to preserve the Jewish way of life as it existed prior to
modem times. Haredi parties, in their attempt to preserve an ancient Jewish regime, have
to date constituted a political backlash directed against the tide of modernity that
engulfed the NRP. The Haredi reaction, like many others, is often disguised as a romantic
desire to return to a past that was allegedly happier and more emotionally secure for Jews
than the modern life with its doubts and uncertainties. The Haredi-indoctrinated community
strives to suppress all doubts of members and believes that happiness is thus achieved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The disagreement between Haredim and most other Israeli Jews over Zionism
is complex. The Haredim and the Zionists agree about the centrally important Zionist
principle that anti-Semitism is an eternal quality common to all non-Jews and is different
from xenophobia and/or any hatred of other minorities. This view is, of course, similar to
that held of Jews by anti-Semites. (This similarity probably accounts for the political
contact between some Zionists, beginning with Herzl, and &quot;moderate&quot;
anti-Semites, who only wanted to rid their societies of Jews or limit the numbers of Jews
in their societies without killing them.) The views concerning and the fears of
anti-Semitism shared by the secular right and the Haredim accord with this central
principle of Zionism better than do the views currently held by the left Labor and Meretz
parties, which are frequently accused by Likud of not being sufficiently Zionist.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Haredi ideology nevertheless clashes with Zionism on certain other
principles. Two major examples are the Zionist aims to concentrate all Jews, or as many as
possible, in and to establish a Jewish stare in Palestine. These aims or dogmas contradict
the Haredi interpretations of the Talmud and talmudic commentaries. Because of the
perceived contradiction, Haredim have consistently proclaimed, and still proclaim, their
strong opposition to Zionism; they claim that the state of Israelis merely another
diaspora for Jews, and they avoid using Zionist symbols. Every Israeli political party
other than the Haredi, including the NRP, end or begin their conventions with the singing
of &quot;Hatikva,&quot; the Israeli national and the world Zionist movement anthem; the
Haredi parties and organizations do not do this but instead recite Jewish prayers. The
media often condemns the Haredim for not singing &quot;Hatikva&quot; on official
occasions. At all international Zionist conventions held in Israel only the Israeli flag
is displayed. At Haredi conventions held in Israel all flags of the nation states from
which delegates came, including Israel, are displayed in alphabetical order.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Why Islam? An Arab Perspective- Adel Altaher</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"></i>By Adel Altaher</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As simple as the question seems to be, the answer is simply not. Indeed, I
spent many years researching and analyzing different political ideologies and
philosophies, until I was able to shape an understanding of the &#147;political
Islam&#148; concept. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I worked for so many years with all my efforts to unite the masses of the
Arab nations. I tried and hoped to erase the colonial virtual borders that were drawn on a
map, but planted deeply into our minds. The Arab nation has grown to be divided into pits
and pieces. Each part of it is a separate nation to which people identified themselves.
Arabs still have preserved the common language, the same cultural and traditional image,
but one vital element was missing. The feeling of unity and the pride of our nationhood
were shattered to Palestinian Arabs, Egyptian Arabs, Moroccan Arabs, Saudi Arabs, and so
on. Consequently, the economical power, which is the backbone for our progress and
development, has been divided unevenly. For instance, a small country like Kuwait with a
one million in population enjoys a high level of wealth, while on the other hand, a large
country like Egypt with a 65 million in population that have exhausted the countries
economy. Not to forget that maintaining many armies to defend these virtual borders is
much more costly, in comparison with having one large army. Just imagine the resources
that are owned by the Arabs if it was simply controlled by the Arabs. We have all the
means to be a leader in every economical aspect. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The importance and the need for Arab unity are not negotiable issues, but
how to achieve that unity? What factors should derive to such unity? Moreover, what
principles should make that dream achievable? These elements need to be thoroughly
thought. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Should it be the principle that revolves around the Arab race and Arab
blood? However, how would that differs us from the Zionist regime? I understand that all
Arabs have the same language, culture, history, and tradition. Surely, these elements will
make things much easier to relate to one another, but how for these elements to be
utilized to become a strong factor to break the barriers implanted so deep into our minds
without becoming another racist movement? How can we feel the same pain, share the same
dream, and become one body where each part complements the other? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My initial personal approach in activism was through an economical
socialist theory, which was implemented by the eastern block of Europe. The theory sounds
great, and it is a one strong ideology to be used to unit the masses of the Arab world.
Unfortunately, the theory lacked the practicality element, especially when dealing with
humans. Reality is completely different than writing a book derived from some imagination
or a dream. The theory's short come resulted from the unfeasibility to create a society
with only one economical class. That is because not everyone has the same skills, desires,
or shares the same dreams and ambitions. The theory is so powerful, but simply can not be
implemented on human kind. Surely, its implementation came so natural between insects of
the same kind, as in the Ants and Bees social structures, but for humans the proposed
system needs to acknowledge human&#146;s needs and behavior. The success of the Zionist
party was the realization of these factors. It implemented the social structure that was
backed and moderated by the Jewish religion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Through my research, I was looking for theory or a formula that would fit
the Arab world puzzle. A theory that could acknowledge the human behavior, the economical
structure at the social and state level, and an ideology that Arabs can relate to and
accept. The ideology has to be strong enough to organize the internal Arab society, but
still has to relate to the whole world in general, so the Arabs would not be isolated from
the rest of the world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Viewing through history to analyze this Arab identity, it was not
difficult to conclude that Arabs are tribal in nature. The old nomadic way of life has
supported such a structure, and in the more settled areas such as in the farming
communities, the family unit was the most dominant, but it is another form of the tribal
nature of the Arabs. Loyalty amongst Arabs was for either the tribe or the family.
Therefore, the proposed system or the ideology that can unify Arabs has to acknowledge
this fact. The traits that Arabs have adopted from their way of life, nomadic or farming,
such as pride, dignity, generosity, sacrifice, patience, and many others of which
stubbornness is one, have to be key factors in the proposed system. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Analyzing the Islamic Era of the Arabian history, I was extremely
fascinated by the speedy transition of events that lead the Arab world from a shattered
nomadic and sub-farming communities to become a civilization of its own. The one thing
that fascinated me most is the internationalization of the ideology. Islam started amongst
the Arabs, but did not close its doors in the face of other nations. It acknowledged all
ideologies that existed; related to all sub-communities within the society; and built a
structure where everybody can live in harmony. The Arabs had no civilization, or never
constitute a powerful element before that. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Islam was first introduced to the area, the first thing it preached
was the value of life. Islam prescribed people&#146;s relations to each other, and
eliminated the law of the jungle. Islam reshaped the identity of the Arab tribes and
created out of them, in a very short period of time, an Arab nation. Arabs felt proud and
privileged in having this divine teachings arise amongst them, which surely influenced
their lives and made out of them an undeniable entity amongst other nations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The circle of Islam grew so fast, as it was found appealing by other
groups and communities who followed the path of Islam. Other nations that existed at that
time felt threatened and intimidated by the constantly growing power of this newly born
nation, of which Arabs constitute the majority. Arabs and all other Muslims constantly
sacrificed their lives in battlefields to assure the nondiscrimination and the freedom of
worship for Muslims and other religious groups such as Christians and the Jews. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islam formed an undeniable power through its followers, to which other
Nations made sure to maintain on good terms. This made it easier for Muslims to spread the
true teachings of Islam all around the world, and established the largest empire ever
existed through History. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabs have played a major part in introducing Islam to the world and in
building the foundations for the Islamic empire, Nevertheless, numerous credits have been
achieved by non-Arab Muslims who took the leadership on many occasions, and history has
documented their achievements. Today, to my disappointment, it seems that Arabs with their
historical accomplishments have mastered some severe case of arrogance, in which they have
forgotten where were they, and what have they become without Islam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If we have a system in which workability has been proven, and its
stability is assured, then why not use it? As for its continuity, that depends on how
willing are we to hold on to anything? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It comes to my mind a dialogue took place more than a thousand years ago
between an Arab-Muslim commander and the Emperor of Persia. The Emperor spoke down to the
commander undermining his Arab identity, and he described him as a Camel and Sheep keeper.
He further criticized that Arabs are willing to kill each other over a Camel. The
Commander answered by confirming every thing the Emperor said and told him: &quot;We were
even worse than that. We used to make our Idol gods from dried fruits that we ate while we
were drunk, but with Islam GOD has made us a Great Nation.&quot;<br>
Another historical incident comes to my mind as the second Khalifa Omar was approaching
Jerusalem on the back of a donkey. His dress had so many patches, so he was asked to wear
something more presentable and to be escorted by a platoon to impress the Jeruslemites,
who were used to seeing Emperors and Kings demonstrating their might. Omar answered
angrily: &quot;We Arabs have become strong for we held our pride in Islam and not unto
material things.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Where are the Arabs of today from the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic Arabia? I
personally have failed to see a difference. If any thing, I see us Arabs in a much worse
situation than where we were before the rise of Islam. Why not proclaim what is rightfully
ours? Why not rebuild the civilization we once had? Why not get united and go back to GOD,
and why not follow the path of Islam? </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Bombs and Artillery, the Greatest Form of
Terrorism</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></i>By Ruth Anderson</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though in the media Israel constantly portrays itself as the victim of
terrorist attacks on its civilian population, throughout its 52-year history as an
occupying country, it has waged the greatest form of terrorism by bombing and shelling the
civilian populations of Palestine and Lebanon. What is unfortunate is that terrorism has
come to be associated with Muslim and Arab countries while Israel practices a much
deadlier and far-reaching form. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It has repeatedly bombed and targeted schools, hospitals and areas where
large civilian gatherings take place. Often, these civilians are women and children or
patients in hospitals or both. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, on Thursday morning, 16 December, Israeli artillery fire hit a
school in Lebanon, wounding 20 children. The children, ages 6-15, were wounded when an
artillery shell hit their school in Arab Salim, which is 4 miles northeast of the market
town of Nebatiyeh. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The children were rushed to a hospital in Nebatiyeh. At least three of the
injured were in serious condition with wounds to their heads and faces. Other children in
the 400-pupil school were taken to sandbagged rooms used as shelters and later, when the
shelling stopped, sent home. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lebanon&#146;s Prime Minister Salim Hoss called on a multinational
committee which monitors combat in southern Lebanon to convene to discuss the criminal
aggression of Israel against civilians, while Lebanese President Emile Lahoud stated that
the attack threatens to undermine the peace process. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But these children who were so savagely attacked had no guns, no bombs, no
weapons of any kind. There is simply no excuse to shell their school at all. There is no
reason, too, for Israel to man outposts in South Lebanon with its allies, the South
Lebanon Army militia. In South Lebanon, there are 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militiamen. The area is Lebanese not Israeli. The
Israelis have no justification to remain in an area that is not theirs. When Iraq invaded
Kuwait, more than 30 countries responded immediately and ruthlessly and bombed the
invading country back to the nineteenth century. The bombing still continues on an
indiscriminate basis while the sanctions, harsh and cruel as they are, remain clamped on
the suffering civilian population. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and its supporters define terrorism in a way that applies mostly to
resistance groups and seldom to States. For example, when Lebanese resistance groups shell
Israeli army posts, their raids are labeled as terrorist acts. But Israeli Air Force
attacks are always regarded as preemptive or retaliatory regardless of how many Arab
civilian casualties that inevitably far exceed that of Israeli casualties. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The word terrorism is reserved for all acts committed against the State of
Israel. It is common for occupying powers to describe legitimate resistance to oppression
as terrorism, when in actuality such acts are those of freedom fighters who sacrifice
their lives in order to free their countries from the occupying forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It has been quite correctly stated that Israel is not a nation, but an
army with a State. Why is Israel allowed to wage war on the civilian populations of
Palestine and Lebanon without criticism while resistance to Israeli occupation is called
terrorism? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">May it be remembered that terrorism was first adopted in the Middle East
by Zionism. The first airplane hijacking was committed by Israel. The first car-bomb was
an invention of the Zionists. A Zionist truck-bomb blew up the King David Hotel in
Jerusalem killing 88 in 1946. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both former Prime Ministers Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir were
terrorist commanders responsible for a multitude of atrocities, including acts against
their fellow Jews. The Zionist record of terror was long and bloody even before the
creation of the army State of Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And lest we forget, in September 1983, after the withdrawal of the PLO
from Lebanon, the Israelis facilitated the massacre of more than 1,000 Palestinian men,
women and children at the Sabra-Shatila refugee camp in Beirut. The Israeli army
surrounded the refugee camps and sent in troops of the Lebanese Christian fascist party
known as the Phalange. For 36 hours, as the Israelis watched, the killing continued. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that war begins in the minds of men. It is here that peace must
also begin. But it has to begin in the minds of all concerned, not just in the minds of
Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Jordanians and yet not in the mind of Israelis. Even now,
at the time of writing this article, more and more Palestinian land is being confiscated.
And even now, little children from the Lebanese town of Arab Salim suffer from the
physical and emotional wounds that are a result of direct hits to their school. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza Strip</b> - &#147;In the past, the Israelis jailed me in Beersheva.
Once they put me in a cell where there was a Jewish prisoner. I was reading the
Qur&#146;an while he was reading the Torah. One day, he came back from being in the
courtyard and he said to me, &#145;Do you know what I have seen today?&#146; &#145;What
have you seen?&#146; He said, &#145;I have seen a Hamas member!&#146; He didn&#146;t know
that I was also a member of Hamas. &#145;What did he do to you? Did he do something to
you?&#146;, I asked him. &#145;No, he spoke with me in a gentle way&#146;. The
propaganda...what it&#146;s doing against us...The propaganda is a serious weapon;
it&#146;s a kind of battle; it&#146;s a long story...&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hisham is around 30 years old. He lives somewhere in the Gaza Strip. He
has a few exams to pass at the University to finish his studies and is looking for a job.
He likes poetry and arrives at our appointment with a book of Hemingway in English. An
activist in the military branch of Hamas, he was deported on 17 December 1992 to South
Lebanon by the Israeli authorities together with more than 400 Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;When we were allowed to return from Marj Ez-Zohour one year later by
the Israelis, going home I pinched myself to be sure I was not dreaming. Nowadays, with
this &#145;peace&#146;, I pinch myself to be sure I&#146;m not in a nightmare.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I&#146;m a preacher in a mosque. After the four military operations
in Israel in February and March 1997 [in retaliation for the assassination of Yahya Ayyash
in Gaza and Fathi Shiqaqi in Malta], I went to the mosque and said that God had taken
revenge on the criminals, the murderers. The Palestinian Authority (PA) was not happy with
my words because now they are friends with Israel. All the Islamists were rounded up at
that time and I was one of them. After my sermon, at 5 p.m., a group of security agents
came to arrest me. I was not at home. For five days and nights I stayed far from home.
During the night they used to come two or three times looking for me, shouting, turning my
home upside down. All the security agencies. They don&#146;t know the difference between
them, what is exactly their duty, so all the agencies came.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After five days, having nothing to fear, I went to them. I went to
El-Bahriyyeh, the naval police, because one of the officers was my neighbour. I spoke with
him before. He told me, &#145;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;ll take care of you&#146;.
It&#146;s very dangerous to torture me because I have a bad heart. They know I have a
heart condition. I also suffer from several ailments as a result of long periods of
detention in Israeli jails between 1990 and 1995. I have trouble with a lung, the
breathing, the head and I suffer all the time from headaches.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I spent one week there, on the seashore, in El-Jamarek jail, in Gaza
City. One week there is equal to several years of suffering. The cell was badly lit. I was
with two prisoners. The only window was a small window on the door. In front of our cell
there was an empty space for torture. What did they do to extract confessions? They tied
the hands and feet of the prisoners wearing only their underpants. With a rope they
suspended them from the ceiling, their hands tied in the back, a sack over their heads.
Like the meat in the butchery. I was not subjected to this kind of torture, but I saw it.
I couldn&#146;t see by the small window on the door, but I saw it through a small fissure
on the door. I could see a group of prisoners and a group of guards. This was not the
torture, this was only preparation for the torture.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They used a plastic tube, but made of hard plastic. If you beat an
animal with this tube, it would run for one hour without stopping. They hit the prisoners
with this tube. Like in the films, but even in the films you don&#146;t see it. They
tortured in this way from 6 p.m. to 5 the following morning. I heard the screams of the
people from 6 every night for one week. Once I heard someone at 6 in the evening. I
couldn&#146;t stand his cries. Then I fell asleep. I woke up at 10 and he was still
screaming in pain. At 2 in the morning, when I woke again, his voice was very weak. At the
beginning his voice was clear, strong. At 2 a.m. he emitted only small cries, even under
the hardest beatings, because he had lost his voice. In the morning, at 8, they were still
beating him but I couldn&#146;t hear him anymore. Rations of 20 beatings accompanied by
curses and curses against God, too. For a believer, it&#146;s terrible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I spent seven days in the normal cell and then I was released. An
officer just asked me routine questions like my name...these kind of questions...because
they know me. My neighbour, the officer, had told me, &#145;Hisham, in one week
you&#146;ll return home. Your child is crying. I know you want to see him and your wife
too&#146;. After seven days, they told me to go home. Listen to the joke...because there
is a joke...What happened? The same night another security agency knew that I was at home
and came to arrest me, this time Mohammad Dahlan&#146;s Preventive Security Service. How
did they know I was at home? Maybe my neighbour the officer spoke with them...</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;So, I was in Tal El-Hawa now, in Gaza City. On the way they
blindfolded me. When we arrived, they led me to the first floor. I felt it was a clean
place, a clean office, lighted. I heard someone asking me my name. He wrote the name on a
piece of paper and stuck it to my back. Afterwards, they led me to a noisy place, always
blindfolded. I heard the same cassette that I had heard in 1991 in Es-Saraya Prison (in
Gaza City), which was at that time the investigation centre of the Shabak (the Israeli
internal security). I heard this cassette which is familiar to me and I liked it;
it&#146;s a Hebrew song sung by a man and a woman. There was also a religious cassette and
a pornographic cassette, but they didn&#146;t play the latter too much. Exactly like the
Shabak. They utilised, too, a Hebrew radio station that transmits only music. At that
point, the travel of sufferings started.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;There was a corridor, it&#146;s called pass, and two rows of chairs
which could be moved. One walks between the two rows. It was full of people, maybe 50
people. All of them blindfolded. All of them under interrogation. One cannot see the
others, only hear their voices. We know these methods from the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I asked to go to the toilet and they led me there. It was forbidden
to take off the blindfold because they don&#146;t want to be seen. They don&#146;t want us
to know who they are. So they open a door, they put you in a room, afterwards they tell
you, &#145;You&#146;re in the toilet&#146;, and when you look behind your back, you saw a
closed door. When you finished, you should cover your eyes again, otherwise they would
punish you, and the punishment would be perhaps a month without sleeping.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What happened in the corridor? The prisoner stays on his chair until
the investigator comes to call him. The investigator decides the length of time you would
spend on the chair. They don&#146;t always let the detainees sit down. Maybe one would
spend three or four hours standing. Maybe they beat you. I spent the first two nights and
two days without sleeping. No interrogation and no sleeping and all the time the tape, but
only the religious one. This tape creates an atmosphere of being in a trance, anxiety. I
know this cassette from the Shabak. The content is very beautiful but the music is
terrible. The loud music serves also to cover up the screamings of the people being
tortured. There were several interrogation rooms, maybe ten, and when there were too many
people, the rows of chairs were increased from two to three.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After two nights, they called me. Even in the interrogation room,
your eyes must be covered. They asked me to confess whether or not I had done something
against the PA. I hadn&#146;t done anything. &#145;Had you done something during the
Israeli occupation?&#146; &#145;What I had done?&#146;, I asked. &#145;We are the
Authority and we must know what you have done in the past and what you think. And also we
want to know what you confessed to the Shabak and what you had not confessed&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;All the information that I succeeded to hide in the past...all my
sufferings at the hands of the Israeli torturers...now I have to put them under my
feet?... I have done this and this and that...We died under the Israeli torture and now
the Palestinians torture us for knowing what we didn&#146;t reveal to the Shabak!!...Maybe
Arafat is not aware of it...it&#146;s possible...</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;When they torture, they torture in a big way because they don&#146;t
think they have a human being in front of them. Two guards took my legs and beat me on the
soles of my feet, <i>falaqa </i>it&#146;s called. They hit me on the palms of the hands,
on top of the hands, on the head, unmercifully, shouting violently and cursing. Only one
was beating me, or a group of people, in a savage way.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After spending four days in the corridor, they put me in a cell 2
metres x 1.5 metres. Four people were already there, I was the fifth. Nobody could sleep
or take a rest. In addition, there was also the toilet: a hole in the ground. All of them
were supporters or activists of Hamas or Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They use the same Shabak methods but adding the Arab-style torture.
My legs became black. I had never seen my legs like this. They beat me on the feet, they
pushed me. I saw the legs and arms of others. Incredibile. Even the legs of monsters are
not like this: red and black and yellow.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They released me because they found nothing. I was lucky to spend
only three months in Tal El-Hawa. I was very lucky because other people spent seven or
eight months. They can keep you in a dark cell without a window for 60 or 90 days, and in
Tal El-Hawa, the cells are underground. A friend of mine spent 85 days in the isolation
cell measuring 1metre x 1.5 metres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The prisoners are tortured in PA jails for their acts of resistance
against the Israeli occupation. I ask why. It&#146;s not patriotic, only the traitors can
do it. They play completely the role of traitors. And I ask why the collaborators (with
Israel) work in Tal El-Hawa and why the real fighters are imprisoned and tortured in Tal
El-Hawa?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I said to the officer when I was in jail, &#145;Don&#146;t torture
the prisoners, don&#146;t force them. They have limits. You can beat me for one day, the
day after also, but I cannot stand more and I&#146;ll explode and my explosion will be
catastrophic&#146;. I repeated to the officer, &#145;Don&#146;t torture the prisoners
because you yourself are making the extremists. You push them to be extremist in their
struggle against you. They will kill you unmercifully, don&#146;t reach that point because
nobody will be able to control the consequences, no Hamas, not the PA, nobody.&#146; But
when you say this to someone who carries death inside himself...Nothing has changed
since.&#148;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Now Americans Know What A Rubber Bullet Really Is</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Ray Hanania*</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I walked around the West Bank with my cousins in 1990, the Intifadah
was raging.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For most Americans, it was a mini version of the Vietnam War, except that
their money, not their sons, were involved. The Intifadah became a familiar word to
Americans mainly through constant TV broadcasts showing scenes of old women wearing Hijabs
and head covers&#151;both Christians and Muslims alike&#151;and young boys fearlessly
confronting heavily armed Israeli soldiers who had orders to &#147;break the bones&#148;
of protesters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was reminded of all that while watching the similar confrontations
between the Seattle police and the protesters at the World Trade Organization convention
there.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The five days of confrontations were reminiscent of the Intifadah for
several reasons, not simply because there were brutal confrontations between the police
authorities and unarmed civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there was a lot of talk about &#147;rubber bullets&#148; and the use
of &#147;tear gas.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the tear gas: this is the same tear gas that Suha Arafat was
referring to when she criticized the Israelis for &#147;poisoning&#148; Palestinian youth
over the years. Tear gas does have a negative health impact on civilians, especially if it
is used constantly. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, tear gas was a staple of the Israeli military drive to suppress
popular Palestinian civilian protests, which were no more violent than the protests we
witnessed in Seattle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, Suha Arafat is not unlike her husband. Nor is she much
different than the Islamists who wish to turn Palestine into a Muslim nation. She
doesn&#146;t understand when and how to present a critical issue properly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a consequence, Suha Arafat came under a lot of criticism, and the issue
has been buried in diplomatic media bureaucracy. It&#146;s not an issue to anyone except
us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the issue of rubber bullets has really hit home. These past weeks, we
have heard outraged Americans denounce the use of rubber bullets. One woman told of how
three of her teeth were knocked out by the rubber bullets and how they left painful marks
all over her body and on her friends and neighbours as well.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They were screaming as if rubber bullets were a violation of human rights.
As if rubber bullets were the weapon of choice for the Anti-Christ. As if rubber bullets
were the symbol of tyranny and civil rights violations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They are right. But where were they in the 1980s and 1990s when rubber
bullets were used so frequently and Israel was turning their production into an industry
rivaling tourism?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rubber bullets and &#147;plastic coated&#148; ball bearings called
&#147;plastic bullets&#148; were used often. They weren&#146;t the weapon of choice for
the Israelis, who preferred live ammunition when firing on unarmed Palestinian women and
children who lobbed the only weapon they had, rocks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like the Seattle police who alleged that Seattle protesters were lobbing
Molotov Cocktails at them, justifying the force, the Israelis argued the same point,
asserting that Molotov Cocktails were frequently thrown and therefore justified their
harsh, brutal measures.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No one challenged the Israeli claim, which was an exaggeration, a
distortion, and in most cases, an outright lie. But Seattle residents are challenging the
Seattle police on that point.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I don&#146;t recall one building burning down during the five days of
protests, which did get rowdy, did get physical, but were dominated by police excesses
against mostly unarmed civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I hope the residents of Seattle, Washington, in the northwest corner of
the United States, save those rubber bullets as souvenirs of what it&#146;s like to be
brutalized.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maybe they might understand now what it&#146;s like to have police fire at
your children who are protesting, and then have the police response explode into a police
riot, as was typical of the Israeli soldier&#146;s response to Palestinian efforts to
protest a brutal occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And maybe someone might now re-examine Suha Arafat&#146;s inarticulate
effort to highlight one of the great crimes of the Israeli occupation, the use of tear gas
and its after-effects on the young children of a civilian population held by its throat in
the grip of unchecked military excesses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maybe, just maybe, people might understand why the Palestinians have been
so angry with the Israelis and why they blame much of their problems on the United States
and its citizens, whose tax dollars are branded indelibly on the empty canisters of tear
gas that line Palestinian streets.</p>

a home he has never visited</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></i>By Carleton Cole</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmad Kawash was born in 1958 in a refugee camp in southern Lebanon, ten
years after the event which Palestinians refer to as Al-Nakba (The Catastrophe) and
Israelis celebrate as their War of Independence. Many of his family remain there, while
others have since scattered around the globe in search of economic and educational
opportunity. But none of them live in Meirun, the small Galilee village where his
ancestors lived for generations and from which the Kawash family was forced to leave half
a century ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmad grew up on stories of the beauty and bounty of northern Palestine,
where his family tended olive, fig and apricot trees and herded sheep and goats. His
ancestors farmed the fertile land for centuries, living in tightly-knit, interlocking
social circles, in what was famously known as the &#147;one-family village&#148; because
everyone was in some way related to one another. Meirun, which means &#147;the high
springs&#148; in the Canaan language, has long been surrounded by green hills with many
natural water sources.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In raising his 16-year-old son Talal, Ahmad wants to keep alive the family
dream of returning to Palestine. &#147;I want my son to know about my culture. I want him
to know about the village where his grandfather grew up. I want to pass this on to
him.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmad waits and hopes for a breakthrough in the peace process, looking for
signs that the unimaginable could become reality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a speech given to the United Nations General Assembly in September,
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat stressed that the right of the four million
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland needed to be addressed in final status
talks with Israel. The two sides hope to reach an agreement by next September, when Arafat
aspires to attend the UN Millennium Summit as president of an independent Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following a 1 November meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Arafat in Oslo, Norway&#151;birthplace of the current peace process&#151;a fresh round
of talks opened up recently in the West Bank town of Ramallah. The two sides hope to agree
to a timetable for negotiations over the next ten months concerning the future of
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the fall of 1948, Ahmad&#146;s parents, older siblings and dozens of
other relatives were told at gunpoint to leave their homes and were driven north to the
Lebanese border by Israeli soldiers. Emptying 450 such Palestinian villages was part of
the Israeli reaction to the attack on Jewish settlements by the armies of Egypt,
Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq earlier in the year when Israel announced its
independence. The young nation was putting into motion UN resolution 181, which called for
the partition of Palestine into two States: one Arab and one Jewish. That 1947 resolution
also stated, however, that Meirun village was to lie within the new Arab State of
Palestine, a State which Israel never allowed to form.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Growing up in exile meant many years of poverty, uncertainty and fear for
the Kawashes. Very little of the family fortune, tied to the land and its fertility, made
it out of Palestine. As Ahmad grew older, what he had thought of as &#147;a normal
life&#148; began to seem strange as he noticed discrepancies between his family&#146;s
sparse surroundings in the Mia Mia refugee camp and the more comfortable homes of native
Lebanese living in the nearby town of Saidon. He grew up in hand-me-down clothes, without
toys, and for many years lived in a house made of clay.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the Six Day War in 1967, the camp came under more frequent air
attacks from Israel. PLO recruitment and guerilla activity, which many in Ahmad&#146;s
family were involved in, increased. &#147;They bombed my friend&#146;s house. They bombed
my neighbour&#146;s house. You always felt fear, never knowing when an F-16 was going to
appear in the sky and drop bombs on the camp.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eventually, as family members found employment in the West, the Gulf and
elsewhere and sent remittances home, the family&#146;s living conditions improved. The
increased stability allowed the Kawashes new opportunities, and Ahmad embarked on an
American education in 1978 as Lebanon&#146;s implosive 15-year civil war was heating up.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the University of Mississippi&#151;where he studied civil engineering
before transferring to Northeastern University in Boston&#151;Ahmad developed a passion
for cooking in an attempt to bring the missed tastes of home to fellow Arab student
friends. &#147;We were sick of eating hamburgers and sponge bread,&#148; he says. After
finding a can of dough which he managed to turn into bread which &#147;wasn&#146;t 100
percent, but closer to home,&#148; Ahmad soon developed a reputation for good cooking
among his friends.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like most of his friends, Ahmad was determined to return to Lebanon after
graduating. Israel&#146;s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, when Ahmad earned his engineering
degree, helped him decide that staying in the United States and earning money and
&#147;proper identification documents&#148; was the best option for the time being.
Without a green card, Ahmad opted to find work in the food service industry, where
personal records are not as stringently checked. Since then, he has owned, leased, or
worked in various restaurants and delis, most recently serving the fare of his homeland in
Moody&#146;s Falafel Palace and the Middle East Caf�, both in Central Square, Cambridge.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;When I cook, its like I&#146;m in a different world. It releases a
lot of stress. I enjoy serving people, and when they tell me they like my cooking. I want
to have my own diner&#151;it&#146;s good money. The food business lets you interact with
people, that&#146;s what I really like,&#148; he says. Ahmad also hopes to start a cooking
show on the Arab Broadcasting Corporation, with an emphasis on his &#147;healthier&#148;
recipes for often-fatty Middle Eastern dishes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As American living became more routine and comfortable, Ahmad&#146;s
desire to return home lessened, and he obtained his U.S. citizenship in 1992. He continues
to visit the Middle East regularly though. &#147;You could even say that getting an
American passport was more important than the degree,&#148; he says. He describes the
document issued to him in Lebanon that allows him to travel, though labels him a
Palestinian refugee, as &#147;a curse. Wherever you go, the assumption is you are a
terrorist.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Ahmad learned that the landmark peace agreement signed by President
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn in 1993 would not
directly address Galilee, he says he felt betrayed. &#147;It was those of us from Galilee,
from northern Palestine, my uncles and cousins, who were killed, who were involved in the
revolution from the outset,&#148; he says. &#147;It didn&#146;t even mention us. They were
talking about the West Bank and Gaza. We gave a lot, but so far we have received
nothing.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As he talks on this rainy evening, a thermos of day-old Turkish coffee
sits, aging, on Ahmad&#146;s low coffee table, which sits atop the dark, intricate
patterns of an Oriental rug. He says that letting the coffee &#147;ferment&#148; for a few
days lets its flavor fully develop.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Time, Ahmad says, is the most crucial factor in the tortuous road to peace
in his homeland and the rest of the Middle East. &#147;I was the most radical person until
two years ago. I used to say, &#145;It&#146;s either us or them.&#146; But you have to be
realistic. I know there will never be a perfect solution, either for us or for them. We
have to have some sort of compromise.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmad pours two cups of the coffee into two classically small cups and
warns not to drink it too quickly. &#147;You have to let it settle,&#148; he says.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Family pictures, PLO posters of soldiers and revolutionary slogans, and
artwork featuring Islamic holy sites in Mecca and Jerusalem cover much of the wall space
in his modest, dimly lit Cambridge apartment. Prominently centred on one wall is a large
childhood photograph of Talal, his only child.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmad won custody of his son after the break-up of his short-lived
marriage to an American woman he met while studying at Northeastern.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In the Middle East, we are very attached to the children we bring
into this world,&#148; he says. Talal is named after Ahmad&#146;s eldest brother&#151;a
regular visitor to the apartment&#151;who is in turn named after his grandfather. &#147;I
named my son Talal in honour of my eldest brother, who didn&#146;t have any sons,&#148; he
explains.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After two decades of living in America and his entire life in exile, Ahmad
keeps faithful to his dream of going to Meirun, and building a life there. He hopes to
build a villa on his ancestral homeland and hire hands to cultivate the land, or perhaps
open a guesthouse. &#147;If not me, then my children or grandchildren. I have not been
there, but I have a spiritual connection to the land,&#148; he says.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Time is the most important factor. Somehow, I am optimistic.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were many casualties in 1948, and only one tragedy. One of the
direct casualties of the Palestinian tragedy, which lies at the heart of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, has been the oft-forgotten Palestinian community inside the Green Line (the
Israeli Arabs). Almost overnight, it became a minority in its ancestral homeland. Since
1948, this community has struggled to recapture its lost identity and define a new sense
of meaning for its existence <i>vis-�-vis</i> an aggressive Zionist project that
successfully built the strongest military State in the Middle East, mobilized millions of
world Jewry either to immigrate or to support financially and morally the newly created
Israeli State, and gained a distinctive international and military presence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinians use the term <i>nakba</i> or disaster to refer to the
1948 defeat. On the other hand, the Israelis, and with them many Jewish and Christian
theologians in the West, hail their victory in 1948 as a divine intervention on behalf of
an exiled nation returning to its ancestral land after more than 2,000 years of exile and
alienation. The Israeli victory in 1948 cannot be understood apart from the pain and
suffering of the Palestinian people. Israel did not build its institutions and
infrastructure in a vacuum, but in the shadow of a tragic Palestinian memory, and on the
shoulders of the few remaining Palestinians who were spared physical exile.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most subtle form of exile is cultural and national loss and
confusion. Different factors tend to exasperate this exile, most notably the flight of the
indigenous intelligentsia and the noise of an approaching foreign culture with indefinite
hegemonic possibilities. After 1948, the remaining Palestinian community underwent a
traumatic experience and suffered from the pain of separation and solitude. It has taken
it several decades to come to terms with this separation; yet, the wounds are still fresh
and the challenges are so many. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major challenges facing the Palestinian community in Israel
(it stands a little bit over a million people in 1999) has been to preserve its
homogeneous cultural and national identity, especially as Israel has followed a formal
policy of dividing the Arabs into Muslims, Christian, Druze and Bedouin. This division,
which does not follow any consistent rules, further subdivided the Palestinian community
into competing tribes, clans and families, which even the so-called Israeli Left uses when
referring to the Palestinian community inside the Green Line. The divide-and-rule policy
was also enhanced by a more conspicuous policy of confiscating Arab land (never a Jewish
land), and forcing some members of the community to serve in the Israeli army without any
consideration for their religious or national feelings as Arabs. The &#147;Law of
Return&#148; promulgated by the Knesset in 1951 gives every Jew in the world the right to
&#147;return&#148; to Israel, while the Palestinians cannot enjoy this right. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The period between 1948 and 1967 was particularly bleak for the
Palestinian community inside the Green Line. It was totally cut off and insulated from the
rest of Palestinian society and the Arab and Muslim world, and its deep wounds and silent
anguish were known only to their family members in exile. In this period, the Palestinian
community faced military rule, land confiscation, and a major social and economic
upheaval. The nascent Israeli State, with a flux of immigrants and Western money, was in
the process of building its infrastructure for which a large labour force was needed. Its
economy was flourishing thanks to the efforts of the international Zionist movement and
the financial and military support of the Western world. Overnight, the Israeli economy
found it feasible to convert the Arabs from farmers into labourers working for the huge
Israeli markets. This was made easy by the fact that large areas were confiscated from the
Palestinian community.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the absence of the traditional Palestinian intelligentsia, and under
the impact of the secularized Israeli State, the Israeli Communist Party began to play a
major role in the political and cultural life of the Palestinian community. From the
beginning, and under pressure from Moscow, the Communist Party recognized Israel and hoped
that Israel would become a pro-Soviet country in the Middle East. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Israel did not turn out to be a pro-Soviet State in the Middle
East, the Israeli Communist Party exerted much effort trying to build political support in
the heart of the Palestinian community. The success of the Party was owing to several
political and social factors and to the efforts of the so-called resistance poets, such as
Mahmoud Darwish, Tawfiq Zayyad, Salem Jubran, and the literary critic Emile Habibe, who
shaped the cultural policies of the Israeli Communist Party. With Soviet and East European
help, the Communist Party sponsored the university education of a good number of
Palestinian students, some of whom returned to assume leadership roles in different
sectors of Palestinian society. All this indicates that between 1948 and 1967 a process
was under way to create a new kind of intelligentsia, secular by nature, to represent the
Palestinian community. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But things began to change dramatically after 1967. The Arab defeat in
the war and the subsequent Israeli occupation of Arab land&#151;the Golan Heights, the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Sinai&#151;have had major repercussions on the whole
area. Aside from its deep political and military consequences, the 1967 war reunited,
ironically enough, the lost Palestinian community inside the Green Line with its brothers
and sisters on the West Bank and in Gaza. &#147;Reunification under occupation&#148; is a
phenomenal paradox with deep implications. In the long run, it helped to diminish the
power of the Israeli Communist Party and give rise to nationalist and Islamic elements
within the Palestinian community.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rise of the Islamic movement inside the Green Line, a phenomenon
unheard of before 1967, represented the most serious challenge to the hegemony of the
Israeli Communist Party over the Arab masses in Israel, and the most rigorous response to
the cultural and political policies of the Israeli State. Some considered the rise of the
Islamic movement on the political and cultural scene to be a fading phenomenon. Its rise
after 1967, however, can be ascribed to the following main reasons: first and foremost is
the &#147;reunification&#148; of the Palestinians under the Israeli occupation and the
resumption of cultural and social activities between the Palestinians of the Green Line
and those of the occupied West Bank and Gaza. The second reason relates to the rise of
Islamic activism in both Gaza and the West Bank and its impact on the Palestinians inside.
One inevitable result of the Israeli occupation was that many Palestinians from inside the
Green Line began to seek religious education in different West Bank universities and
Shari&#146;ah colleges. This situation gave birth to a new, young and religiously
committed leadership which capitalized on the religious feelings of the masses and offered
a new interpretation of Islam to suit the particular needs of the Palestinians in Israel.
The net result of all of this was the gradual weakening of the hold of the Communist Party
over the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is interesting, however, is that most of the leadership of the new
Islamic movement come from a rural background; they are from the Triangle area, an area
that was handed over by King Abdullah of Jordan to Israel in 1949. Bereft of any sort of
Palestinian leadership inside, the Palestinian community worked hard to create its own
leadership, which took at least three decades after 1948. The most difficult task
confronting the Islamic movement has been how to bring back confidence to a wounded nation
suffering from exile and alienation in its homeland. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To embody its vision of a dynamic Islamic presence inside the borders
of 1948, the Islamic movement began to build its own mosques and Islamic centres in the
main Arab villages and towns. From there, the movement began to draw large masses into its
religious and political activities. As a result, the Communist Party gradually lost its
ground of support among the Arab, especially Muslim, masses in Israel. Two major events
after 1967 underscore the emergence of the Islamic movement as a major mass organization:
the Land Day of 1976 and the Palestinian intifadah, which began in Gaza and the West Bank
in 1987. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rise of the Islamic movement as a credible religious voice
representing the downtrodden and the dispossessed was not without its difficulties and
problems. At the present, there are two Islamic movements representing two different
Islamic discourses or approaches to deal with the problems of the Arab community in
Israel. The first is represented by Sheikh &#145;Abdalla Nimr Darwish of Kufr Qasim, and
the second by Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah, the mayor of the city of Umm al-Fahem, both in the
Triangle. Sheikh Darwish&#146;s Islamic philosophy is somewhat different from Sheikh
Ra&#146;ed Salah&#146;s. Darwish prefers to run in the Knesset elections as a way to deal
with the problems of the Palestinian community, while Sheikh Salah looks at the whole in a
much wider sense. It is important, he notes in one of his interviews, to rebuild fresh
connections between the Palestinian community and the larger Arab and Muslim realities of
the world. From this angle, it is important to build alliances with the Islamic movement
in different parts of the Muslim world, in Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and India. The main bone
of contention between the two movements is not simply running in the Israeli elections,
but the whole question of Islamic identity and the best ways to preserve and enhance it in
a totally secularized and antagonistic context.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Max Weber speaks of charisma as the main reason behind the rise and
progress of social movements throughout human history. Ra&#146;ed Salah, a charismatic,
humble and quiet personality, represents the aspirations of the Palestinian generation
that was born after 1948. The Islamic movement led by him and his deputy, Sheikh Kamal
al-Khatib of the village of Kufr Kanna, north of Nazareth, has emerged in recent years as
the most outspoken movement with deep grass-roots organization and following. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an interview I conducted with Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah in Nazareth in
February 1999, he gave a number of reasons for the rise of Islamic activism in Israel in
the early 1970s. For many years after the foundation of Israel, argues Sheikh Salah, the
Muslim youth, under pressure from Israeli society, lived in a state of <i>jahiliya</i>
(ignorance), with alcoholism and drug use on the rise. The whole community experienced a
loss of identity, and it took a while for a new leadership to emerge and offer a programme
to diminish the real reasons behind this loss. What lies at the heart of this Islamic
programme of action is the Islamic notion of authenticity or <i>asalah</i>, which
expresses the need for a cultural link with the Islamic civilization and the larger Arab
and Muslim world.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamic movement has set up two major committees: the first is the
committee for the defense of the Aqsa mosque and the Islamic sacred places, and the second
is a charitable committee to raise money for the needy and the refugees. In the current
Kosovo crisis, the Islamic movement led by Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah sent a medical team to
Albania and collected over $1 million on behalf of the Albanian refugees from Kosovo.
Aware of the importance of journalism, the Islamic movement sponsors a weekly newspaper, <i>Sawt
al-Haq wa&#146;l Hurriyya</i>, which deals with local news, analysis and fiqh lessons.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Based on its recent activities, which attract people by the thousands,
the movement has become very popular since it carries the pain and concerns of the
Palestinian masses inside the Green Line. It speaks the language of a suffering community.
In the mind of the movement, the Palestinians inside the Green Line are part of the larger
Arab and Muslim world, and the official division adopted by the State of Israel since 1948
has intended to take advantage of a weakened Palestinian body. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Constructing the infrastructure of the Islamic movement is only half
the job. The other half is enhancing the Islamic identity of the movement and the
Palestinians in a country, i.e. Israel, that has fought relentlessly to establish its
foundations in derogation of Palestinian and Arab rights. Furthermore, the Islamic
movement, as an anti-Zionist movement, struggles deeply against the confiscation of land
inside the Green Line and the suffocation of the Palestinians in the occupied land. No
wonder, then, that the official Israeli media has considered the movement as a
reactionary, confrontational and fundamentalist movement seeking to dismantle the State of
Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamic movement in Israel has shouldered its responsibilities with
rare courage and deep vision. Its leadership is young and dynamic, and it represents a
very young population, most of whom were born after 1948. The challenges, however, are
great. It struggles to leave its mark on the Arab population in a State that technically
is not theirs. The right wing often proclaims that Israel is a land for the Jews, and it
is high time that the Arab guests leave. The Islamic movement is under the watchful eyes
of the Israeli authorities, and for good reason. It does not buy into the Zionist
philosophy of the State.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamic movement was born in difficult times, and its survival
depends on the creative solutions it finds to the difficult problems facing the growing
Palestinian minority in Israeli society. The State of Israel is determined to continue the
divide-and-rule and confiscation policies until it completes the Judaization of <i>Eretz
Yisrael</i>. Tough challenges create tough movements. The Islamic movement inside the
Green Line can survive, however, only with the thorough support of the masses inside as
well as outside the Green Line.</p>
