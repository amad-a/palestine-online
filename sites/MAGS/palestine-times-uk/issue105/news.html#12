<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Bir Zeit Students Stone French PM<br>
Following Remarks Against Hizbullah</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>&#150; <b>From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority, a virtual Police State without a State, has
been cracking down on Bir Zeit University students following the incident at Bir Zeit on
Saturday, 26 February, in which stones were hurled at visiting French premier Lionel
Jospin following his description of resistance to Israeli occupation as
&#147;terrorism.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Palestinian sources, PA security agencies have been
conducting a campaign of mass arrests of Palestinian students, university employees and
activists in and around Bir Zeit University, 10 miles north of Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As of 29 February, as many as 39 students were being held at PA
intelligence and police headquarters in Jericho. Eyewitnesses report that at least three
detainees have been beaten and one has been subject to &#147;shabeh,&#148; or tying the
prisoner in a painful and contorted position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One person arrested by the Palestinian Authority is reported by
eyewitnesses to have swollen hands, ears and face, ostensible signs of physical abuse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, lawyers and family members were still being denied access to the
detainees. It is feared that the students will be tried before the notorious &#147;State
Security Court,&#148; which all human rights organizations agree is a mockery of justice.
Arrests are continuing, and PA officials have stated that arrested students may be banned
from all institutions of higher education in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As of 29 February, Bir Zeit University remains closed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Here is how Allan Shehadeh, a professor teaching at the University
described the situation:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Bir Zeit is under siege. Since Saturday, PA security forces have
been raiding homes in the day and in the middle of the night, arresting scores of BZU
students (and some who are not students)&#151;the count could be well over 100 in the last
3 days. In some cases, PA secret service police, riding in unmarked cars, have pulled up
to walking students and abducted them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Others were arrested on the University campus by armed men, crossing
a major red line regarding the presence of arms on campus. On Saturday evening, they
conducted a thorough search of the campus, office by office, and kicked in the men&#146;s
bathroom door when they didn&#146;t have the key to unlock it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Many other students have been taken away at checkpoints, while
others have been arrested at impromptu checkpoints in the Ramallah and Bir Zeit villages.
The campus is infiltrated with student spies working for the PA, who give lists of names
of people to be arrested. In addition, the Israelis have put in place a stringent
checkpoint on the Bir Zeit-Ramallah road, including an ambush site (where people who see
the checkpoint ahead often get out of the taxi so as not to pass through it).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Israeli army has used the PA&#146;s mass arrests to conduct its
own. In addition, students who marched in Ramallah on Sunday to protest against the
arrests were followed afterwards by secret service people (who connivingly participated in
the marches themselves) and were arrested. This morning, I was told by people coming from
Ramallah that the Manara road and the road leading to Bir Zeit is lined with riot police
in full gear. They are attempting to breed a climate of fear.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What is more important is the opposition and solidarity this
hyper-thyroided frenzy is generating. Every Palestinian university (including al-Azhar in
Gaza) is currently awaiting word from the BZU student movement to hold a huge rally in
Ramallah to protest the PA&#146;s actions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The general atmosphere on campus today is that of defiance and unity
in action. If there were any reservations about whether the stone-throwing against Jospin
was legitimate, they have been wiped away by anger at the PA, including even the Shabiba,
the pro-Arafat students.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;On campus, professors and students alike are incensed that the
administration even invited Jospin to speak here in the first place, and in the second
that the Sulta decided to intervene in University affairs. One resolution presented at the
very heated employee union meeting was to demand that from now on, no more Zionists be
invited to the University, and that secondly, when big-name visitors are invited to speak,
they do so from Kamal Nasser Auditorium to show respect for the struggle (Jospin
apparently refused to speak in the hall because it was dedicated to Kamal Nasser, who was
assassinated in Beirut in 1972 by an Israeli commando team as part of &#147;operation
god&#146;s wrath,&#148; which sought to eliminate 1,000 Palestinians who might provide
leadership to the struggle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;One professor said, &#145;Arafat needs to be reminded who Bir Zeit
University is and what the stones of Bir Zeit mean, and on which children&#146;s backs he
rode into this land.&#146; There was a strong sentiment that the PA is even worse than the
Israeli occupation army. One example mentioned: The stoning of the U.S. ambassador who
tried to visit the University in 1985; his car did not even make it into the main gate
before it had to turn back, and the Israeli army response didn&#146;t come close to that
of the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;As far as the PA&#146;s reaction, I think the main point is that the
stoning (and even the protest) of Jospin, an official PA guest, was seen as not only
embarrassing but also as a direct challenge to the Authority. Jospin was accompanied by
Nabil Shaath and other big cheeses on Saturday. The stones could easily have been for them
as well. Because the PA is mainly run by gangsters, the tools they know are force and fear
(not sophisticated mind control as in democratic countries), and they acted accordingly. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Of course, Palestinians, being who they are, don&#146;t respond very
amenably to these tactics; if anything, its like pouring gasoline on a fire. (and based on
what I heard today, many people are hoping that this fire will finally consume the PA once
and for all, and many are talking about &#145;the coming war&#146;. The second point about
the PA is that it has been struggling for a long time to gain control of the University,
and this incident is the perfect excuse. It has already proposed (on Monday) to station
security forces at the University from now on.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, student demonstrations throughout the West Bank are continuing
despite a ban on public protests ordered by PA Police Chief Ghazi al-Jabali. The
demonstrators are demanding the immediate release of all detained students and vowed they
wouldn&#146;t return to classrooms as long as even one of their colleagues remained in PA
custody.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In return, Arafat seems to view the demonstrations as a direct challenge
to his authority, and he is ordering his security agencies to hit mercilessly at the
&#147;enemies of our people and the forces of darkness who are trying to abort the
Palestinian new-born.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinians observe massacre&#146;s anniversary</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron, West Bank</b> - Thousands of Palestinians observed the sixth
anniversary of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on 25 February with calls for the evacuation
of terrorist Jewish settlers from downtown Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Between 15,000 to 20,000 Palestinians, mostly affiliated with the local
Islamic movement, carried placards reading &#147;The followers of Goldstein must leave
Hebron&#148; and &#147;Goldstein and Levy are the same, the only difference is the
name.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The huge rally, which took place at the Ibn Rush Stadium in Hebron&#146;s
city centre, was addressed by several speakers who unanimously pointed out that the
mentality that produced and formulated the mindset of the mass-murderer Barouch Goldstein
was still alive and well among Jewish settlers in the West Bank as well as among a wide
sector of Israeli and non-Israeli Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Goldstein went to hell, but Goldstein-ism is alive and well,&#148;
said Rafiq al-Natshe, the Palestinian Authority&#146;s Minister of Labour.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Natshe told the huge multitude that the vast bulk of settlers and Israelis
were still viewing Goldstein as a national hero and a great saint.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Israeli government tells the world that Goldstein was an
aberration in the Israeli society, but the truth is that he represented the mainstream
thinking in Israel,&#148; Natshe said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that in an opinion survey two weeks following the massacre,
over two thirds of Israeli-Jewish high school students considered Goldstein a hero and
what he did &#147;a good thing.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Natshe said the fact that some Israelis and Jews were ostensibly
disquieted by the massacre had more to do with &#147;the negative public relations
generated by the massacre and less with their objection to what he did to the
Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another speaker, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub, pointed out that the differences
between Goldstein and other Israeli leaders, past and present, and from right to left,
were only &#147;cosmetic in nature.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Look! Even their Foreign Minister, who is supposed to be diplomatic
and circumspect in his public utterances, said bluntly the other day that he was going to
murder Lebanese children and set Lebanon on fire.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajoub, brother to Jebril Rajoub (Head of the Palestinian Authority&#146;s
Preventive Security Force), asked sarcastically, &#147;Is Levy also as demented as they
claimed Goldstein was...and how come lunatics do become Foreign Ministers in this State?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I&#146;m 100% sure that if Goldstein hadn&#146;t been killed, he
would have been elected by a landslide majority by Israeli voters...Didn&#146;t they elect
Barak after he made it clear to them how he had been an efficient killer?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rajoub said there was no way Palestinians could live with Jewish settlers
who teach their kids that &#147;Arabs and non-Jews are donkeys and that God only made them
in a human form for the sake of Jews.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;How can we possibly live with those who teach their kids that Arab
and non-Jewish women are prostitutes without any honour...how can we live with those who
consider us scum, vermin and dirty animals that ought to be exterminated?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A third speaker, Abdul Khaleq al-Natshe, warned the Palestinian Authority
against &#147;tampering with our people&#146;s legitimate rights.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The PA must understand that any arrangement that fails to recover
our legitimate rights will be deposited in the trash basket of history.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that up to 20,000 people turned out for the rally, organized by
the Islamic movement, suggests that Hamas was still a force to reckon with in the
self-rule areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and the PA, through concerted action, have dealt many blows to
Hamas, particularly to the movement&#146;s military wing, the Ezzul Deen al-Qassam
Brigades.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, in light of the turn-out in Hebron, it seems that the movement is
still very strong, particularly among the younger generations. </p>

shame called the peace process&#148;</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>A group of Palestinian intellectuals, political
activists and civic leaders have just published a new petition entitled, &#147;A Call From
The Homeland&#151;Part II&#148;, urging PA leader Yasser Arafat to immediately terminate
talks with Israel, end the state of lawlessness throughout the Palestinian society and put
the Palestinian house in order. You might recall that there was a similar petition a few
months ago calling for the same thing. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following is an unofficial translation of the new petition:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">A Call From The Homeland&#151;Part II</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At a time when Israeli occupation forces decide the map of our homeland
through the proliferation of settlement activities, at a time when (Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud) Barak insists on his well-known &#147;No&#146;s&#148; (which include designs to
re-settle Palestinians in the Diaspora), and at a time when the Israeli occupation strikes
the Lebanese people and destroys its infrastructure, we see that the supporters and
opponents of Oslo have both realized the impossibility of recovering our people&#146;s
just rights, including the right of return, the right to self-determination and the right
to establish a Palestinian independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. In the
meanwhile, the Palestinian Central Council met and reiterated that the year 2000 is the
year for the Palestinian State. We see in this reiteration another weak and exposed
manoeuvre at the expense of our just rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We stress here our people&#146;s demand that Palestine is owned by the
Palestinian people, Arab and Islamic nation and the generations to come. It is undivided
and nobody has the right to decide its fate in light of the present imbalance of power. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, we demand the following: the actual withdrawal from
negotiations, termination of the use of the Palestinian people as a bridge for
normalization between Israel and the Arab and Islamic worlds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let&#146;s all work to achieve the principle of legitimacy, rule of law,
establishing an independent legal authority that accounts and exposes all phenomena of
corruption, spoiling and monopoly, and ending the state of estrangement between the
citizen and the country through true confrontation with the new-old bloc, which divided
our people into a small group possessing money and a big, marginalized group.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let&#146;s be one big body entitled to solidarity. Let&#146;s act to
increase the margin of freedom; to liberate the mass media to carry out its role in
unveiling the defects and mistakes and discuss the general situation away from the
domination of one opinion; to release Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails; to
forbid political arrests; to cancel the role of the State Security Court; to direct
investments to a productive sector away from underemployment; to conduct representation
elections for our people whenever it is possible and to ensure regular elections to
preserve truth and credibility of the elected; and to reject the principle of appointment
in local councils.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We reiterate our support of oppressed groups, particularly teachers, small
employees and security personnel, as well as to the dignity of our prisoners, martyrs and
injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We salute the supportive stand of the Lebanese army behind the resistance
in the South. We confirm that the way to Palestine, liberating the south (Lebanon) and the
Golan is the path of Hizbullah&#133;the path of resistance&#133;the way of going back to
the natural relationship with occupation. We call upon masses of Arab and Islamic nations
to reject compliance with the Americans and we confirm our rejection of the Israeli scheme
of separating the various Arab tracks of negotiation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We, the signatories of this statement, confirm our condemnation of the
continuous series of arrests based on opinions, and we request the release of Dr. Abdel
Sattar Qassem and all the political prisoners so that our people&#146;s demands in
releasing Palestinian freedom prisoners from Israeli jails will be understood by the
Palestinian, Arab and international communities. Glory to the martyrs, freedom for the
prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Together in building a free and democratic homeland for all. </p>

<font size="3">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>A Palestinian human rights organization warned of
the Israeli attempts to create new facts on the ground regarding the final status of
Occupied Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">LAW&#151;the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and

complete and permanent Israeli control over Jerusalem. According to the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>,
the Shas party leader explained, &#147;We want to signal to the Palestinians and the world
that Jerusalem is not negotiable and is not divisible.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;As the internal debate within Israeli society rages on as to how
much, if any, land ought to be ceded to the Palestinians, it appears that international
law and humanitarian standards have fallen by the wayside,&#148; LAW said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Even the most &#145;enlightened&#146; of the Barak cabinet, such as
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, have said that Israel must not only maintain the
unity of Jerusalem but must aim to have it recognized internationally as Israel&#146;s
capital.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, LAW added, Palestinian demands, founded on international law
(rather than ethno-religious exclusivity) have been relegated to the realm of the
unattainable, the unrealistic and the impossible. Their voice has become so marginalized
that their most fundamental and just claims are painted as radical and outdated, it said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It is time to mobilize the Palestinian voice and push their demands
to the forefront of the debate, both locally and internationally. It is time for the
Palestinian people to send a clear message to their own negotiators, to Israel and to the
world that lasting peace cannot be achieved without justice.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">LAW will organize an international conference and strategy-building
session, between 5 and 7 June 2000, to discuss these issues and put talk into practice
with the aim of enabling and empowering Palestinian civil society to play a greater role
in determining their own future.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron (West Bank) - </b>Hundreds of school students on 22 February stoned
the PA Education Department in downtown Hebron in protest against the PA refusal to meet
the demands of striking teachers for higher salaries and better working conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA police intervened to disperse demonstrators, using truncheons. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to eyewitnesses, PA police officers from the &#147;Rapid
Intervention Squad&#148; arrived at the site and promptly began pushing the student
protestors. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following the use of force against them by police, the protestors
responded by throwing stones at the police and the Education Department.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to local sources, 15 students were injured by police, including
one student who got a fractured arm. Injured students were taken to the Ahli Hospital in
Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The disturbances were sparked by the continuing strike of thousands of
teachers who are demanding an increase in their salaries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The teachers had staged a strike to force the PA to negotiate a settlement
which the teachers hope will improve, including a pay raise.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA thus far refused to sit down with the teachers&#146; leaders,
accusing them of &#147;breaking the law&#148; and of &#147;harbouring political goals
going beyond the issue of salaries.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA said in a statement that it recognized the &#147;legitimacy of the
teachers&#146; grievances&#148;, adding that the &#147;strike was not the way to solve the
problem.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The teachers&#146; strike has been conspicuous in the southern part of the
West Bank, particularly in Hebron and Bethlehem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, reports from Nablus and Jenin recently spoke of thousands of
teachers joining the strike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The average Palestinian teacher receives a monthly salary of up to $US
340, a sum the teachers contend does not meet the basic necessities for basic, decent
living.</p>

usurped Mosque from Zionists</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tabariya (Occupied Palestine) - </b>Hundreds of Palestinian Muslims from
the Galilee and the Triangle regions on 25 February performed the Friday congregational
prayer at the Albaher Mosque in Tabariya in northern Palestine, despite vociferous Jewish
protests against Muslims&#146; efforts to restore the site.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Mosque itself, seized by Jewish gangs when Israel was created in 1948,
was sealed by the Jewish local authorities and at one point converted to a den for drug
addicts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the local authorities erected a fence to prevent Muslims from
praying in the Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, hundreds of Muslims, mostly associated with the Islamic movement
in pre-1948 Palestine, succeeded in entering the Mosque.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sermon speaker, Um Alfahem mayor Sheikh Ra&#146;ed Salah, called on
Muslims in Palestine to make utmost efforts to extricate the usurped Muslim holy places
from Zionist hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that when somebody transgresses against Jewish holy places
in any part of the world, the Jews make a big outcry.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sheikh Salah attacked those who converted the &#147;houses of God into
prostitution houses and dens of corruption and drug addictions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that Muslims in the Zionist regimes were subject to
religious persecution amid silent connivance on the part of the Israeli government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Jews, he said, were giving themselves <i>carte blanche</i> to
take over and desecrate holy places belonging to others, particularly to Muslims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While Muslims were performing the prayer, several Jewish thugs and
hoodlums assembled outside the site and began shouting anti-Islamic slogans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the prayer went smoothly, as the Muslims refused to be provoked
by the provocateurs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish State still controls over 200 mosques throughout Palestine and
refuses to reopen them to Muslims. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Abdul Sattar Qassem arrested&#133;again</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Around midnight on Friday, 18 February, Palestinian Authority police
arrested the noted Palestinian academic and political activist Abdul Sattar Qassem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Human Rights Organization (LAW) quoted Qassem&#146;s wife
as saying that two agents of the PA police&#146;s Criminal Squad arrived at the
couple&#146;s home in Nablus and arrested the 50-year-old professor of Political Science
at the Najah National University.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mrs. Qassem said the two officers, who did not produce an arrest warrant,
said they had an order to arrest her husband issued by PA President Yasser Arafat and his
Gaza Police Chief Ghazi al-Jabali.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She said she did not know where they took him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA-run electronic media made no mention of Qassem&#146;s arrest, and
even the semi-official printed media, which are normally less tightly controlled, reported
the arrest only on 21 February, three days after it had been circulated by international
news agencies and human rights organizations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qassem was among the 20 Palestinian intellectuals who, nearly three months
ago, circulated a strongly worded petition castigating Arafat&#146;s regime for its
political incompetence and for graft and corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The petition then sparked widespread reactions among Palestinians within
the autonomous enclaves, as well as in the Diaspora, prompting Arafat to order the arrest
of the bulk of the petition&#146;s signatories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, unlike other petitioners, who were incarcerated for nearly ten
days, Qassem and Ahmed Shaker Dudin (a veteran nationalist leader from Dura) were kept in
prison for 37 days for refusing to back down and recant the content of the petition. The
two were finally released on the day of Eidul Fitr, the feast marking the end of the holy
month of Ramadan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear what prompted Arafat to order the arrest of Qassem again.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources in Nablus intimated that the arrest might have been an
attempt by the PA to forestall the circulation of a new petition stressing that the
Palestinian leadership, specifically Arafat, had no right to give up or compromise the
Palestinian refugees&#146; right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sources also said the new petition would also warn Israel and the
United States that any arrangement reached with Arafat that did not satisfy Palestinian
legitimate demands, including first and foremost the right of return for the refugees,
would not be binding upon the Palestinian people even if accepted and endorsed by Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If true, such a petition would raise serious questions about Arafat&#146;s
legal ability to negotiate a &#147;deal&#148; on the refugees, and would also give more
credibility to the growing calls for a referendum in Palestine and the Diaspora on any
final status agreement which Arafat might strike with the Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, neither Israel nor the United States would welcome the referendum
idea, since they both know well that it would have no chance of success, given the intense
insistence by the vast majority of Palestinians on the right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinian schoolteachers continued to boycott
classes for the second consecutive week in protest against lower salaries and the PA
failure to put into effect the Civil Service Law, which was passed last year by the PA
Legislative Council, adopted for one month, but then revoked for lack of funds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A spokesman for the teachers in Hebron refuted PA accusations that the
strike was politically motivated, arguing that &#147;a hungry teacher can&#146;t teach
well.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The spokesman, Abdul Jawwad Al-Attrash, pointed out that the average
Palestinian teacher was receiving a monthly salary of between 1,400 and 1,600 NIS (roughly
US $350-$390), while the average Israeli teacher, who lives under virtually the same
economic conditions, received six times as much.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, the PA has refused to negotiate with the striking teachers, let
alone meet their ostensibly right demands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The lion&#146;s share of the PA budget goes to the security agencies,
which leaves meagre allocations for the civilian sectors, such as health and education.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also, in a related development, PA police closed down a local television
station in Hebron for airing an interview with Al-Attrash, in which he reportedly accused
the PA of pushing the teachers to leave the schools and seek employment on Israeli
construction sites.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron police chief Tareq Zeid accused the Nawras television station of
&#147;incitement&#148; and &#147;endangering national interests in this crucial and
delicate phase of our struggle.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>A prominent Hamas official in the West Bank has
challenged the PA to stick to the &#147;national red lines,&#148; accusing the Palestinian
leadership of failing to resist Israeli dictates and blackmail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We support the concept of setting up a set of inviolable red lines
because Palestine doesn&#146;t belong to a faction or a group, or even to the Palestinian
people alone,&#148; Hassan Yousuf said during a symposium in Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yousuf accused the Palestinian Authority of lacking the will and the
inclination to enter into a genuine dialogue with the Islamist forces.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Look, they invited us to the Central Council meeting, but three days
later they arrested 13 of our cadres and they remain interned without charge or
trial.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yousuf opined that the most serious blunder the PA made was to adopt the
slogan &#147;Palestine for the Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This enabled Israel to bully us and impose her will on us&#133;since
we can&#146;t alone stand up to Israeli hegemony and insolence.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- An Iraqi opposition leader has disclosed that the
Iraqi government, under pressure from the United States, was considering a plan whereby a
million Palestinian refugees would be settled in Western Iraq.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to an article written by Sa&#146;ad Farage, President of
&#147;The Iraqi Activists,&#148; a Washington based organization, the government of Saddam
Hussein was giving out signals suggesting that it was receptive and open to the idea of
settling Palestinians in Iraq.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the signals, he wrote, was a recent Iraqi decree allowing
Palestinians living in Iraq&#151;around 62,000&#151;to own land and property in Iraq.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Farage, the land that the Palestinians would be resettled on
belongs to Kurdish citizens in Kirkuk, Khanaqin and other regions, land which the Iraqi
authorities seized after deporting the owners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is unlikely, though, that the Palestinians will accept this plan since
it would entangle Palestinians with their fellow Kurdish brothers, apart from being
inherently unacceptable since the Palestinians reject any solution that does not involve
their return to their homeland, Palestine.</p>

organizations won the student election at Hebron University held on 28 February, receiving
22 seats out of the 41 seats that make up the college&#146;s student assembly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to HU Dean of Student Affairs, Musa Ajweh, the Islamic Bloc (the
student branch of Hamas) won 19 seats, while its junior sister, the Jama&#146;a Islamiyya
(Islamic Jihad) won three seats.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fatah received 18 seats, and a coalition of leftist groups affiliated with
the Popular and Democratic fronts for the liberation of Palestine won two seats.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The results will thus enable Hamas and the Islamic Jihad to retain control
of the Council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas has been in control of HU&#146;s Student Council for the last ten
years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas completely or partially controls most student councils in
Palestinian universities and colleges.</p>

<p>Some observers believe student elections in the occupied territories by and large
reflect public opinion trends among Palestinians, especially in the absence of general and
municipal elections. </p>
