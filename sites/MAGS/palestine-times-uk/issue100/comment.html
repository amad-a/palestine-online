<p ALIGN="CENTER"><big><font color="#0000FF">Cajoling Arafat into Submission</font></big></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is amply clear that the Zionist regime and the United States are making
concerted efforts to get Yasser Arafat to conclude a hasty &#147;final settlement&#148;
sooner rather than later.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reason for this is not difficult to discern. Yasser Arafat is being
viewed in Tel Aviv and Washington as the &#147;perfect leader&#148; with whom a proper
deal can be struck, one that would conceivably fulfil all that the Zionist regime has
sought to achieve since its misbegotten birth 50 years ago, namely keeping the occupied
land, including Jerusalem, enjoying the fruits of peace, attaining regional economic
domination and political hegemony, and, above all, gaining Arab and Muslim recognition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat is the man, or let&#146;s say the main catalyst, to help get this
job done, as successfully as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That job, euphemistically referred to as &#147;the peace process&#148;,
has in reality one real title that has nothing to do with real peace or genuine
reconciliation between Zionists and Arabs in Palestine, that is the &#147;liquidation of
the Palestinian cause&#148; and the obliteration of such cardinal and enduring issues as
the fate of Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat possesses all the qualifications of the ideal gambler-bargainer. On
the one hand, he tightly controls his people, thanks to the intensive covert and overt
American-Israeli support, which put at his disposal 15 security agencies (last month he
founded a new security agency called the &#147;Special Forces&#148;) and hundreds of
millions of dollars which he can use to increase the efficiency of his police-State grip
on his own people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, he is very obsequious and submissive, especially in the
face of American and Israeli pressure. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, former Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu alluded to this when he
said that &#147;if we just play it tough with Arafat, he will cave in to our
demands.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Netanyahu was right. Arafat did cave in to Israeli pressure on nearly
every conceivable issue and in every round of talks, whether in Oslo, Taba, Cairo, Wye or
Sharm el-Sheikh.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With Arafat&#146;s health (particularly mental health) now reportedly
deteriorating, and with early but definite signs of senility, coupled with other
manifestations of pathetic behaviour obvious in his speeches and public statements, the
Israeli establishment has apparently realized that now is the most opportune time to
cajole Arafat into striking a deal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the Israeli premier Ehud Barak made it clear that Israel should
make peace with Arafat while he was alive because &#147;we may not be able to have another
Arafat for many years to come.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the features of this &#147;dream deal&#148; for the
Zionist regime are increasingly clear.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They include salvaging a deformed and truncated Palestinian
&#147;State&#148;, tailored to suite Arafat and satisfy his State-mania, while leaving the
bulk of the West Bank and up to 30% of the Gaza Strip under Zionist control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Quds al-Sharif, Jerusalem, the mantra which Arafat invokes every day
and vows to make the capital of his State-to-be, will likely remain in one way or the
other in Zionist fetters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And the 4 million to 5 million Palestinian refugees who were uprooted from
their homeland will not be repatriated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Will Arafat, the &#147;indispensable&#148; Palestinian leader who refuses
even to consult his people on matters affecting their destiny and future, accept these
scandalous arrangements?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak says he (Arafat) will accept a &#147;compromise&#148; in the West
Bank. (Barak said on 23 September that Arafat knew well he couldn&#146;t and wouldn&#146;t
get everything.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For their part, the Americans will make sure that Arafat will at least
mean &#147;yes&#148; even if he feels he has to say &#147;no&#148; to his people for
&#147;domestic consumption.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And to expedite and perhaps accelerate the realization of this goal, the
American administration has been actively pressuring Arab regimes to narrow the horizons
of Palestinian and other Muslim resistance groups, such as Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and
Hizbullah, so that Arafat will be &#147;freer&#148; to sell out his people&#146;s rights
and homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this won&#146;t work. For in order for any &#147;peace agreement&#148;
to succeed, it has to meet the interests of the people who are supposed to uphold it and
protect it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, why would anyone expect the Palestinian people to commit
themselves to an agreement, even a final status agreement, that would keep their land,
including the jewel of Palestine, namely Jerusalem, in Zionist hands, and leave millions
of refugees dispersed to the Four Corners of the globe? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Palestinian context, an imposed arrangement tailored according to
the sly wishes of an insolent and arrogant Zionist establishment and imposed or sold by
way of deception to a weak and senile Palestinian leader that is answerable to the enemies
of his people will not be a prescription for genuine peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It won&#146;t be much more than just a brief truce. </p>
