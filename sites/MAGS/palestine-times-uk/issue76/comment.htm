<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Madeleine's Attempt at Mideast Diplomacy
Fails</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is difficult to go on a mission of peace when the Middle
East is in such a state of turmoil.  It is impossible to achieve peace when
a people have lost most of their land and continue to lose what is left
on a daily basis.  When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
the Middle East determined to breathe life into the nearly dead Oslo accords,
she failed to come to terms with what the basic conflict between Palestinian
and Israeli is all about.  It is not just the suicide bombers. They are
merely an expression of frustration at the hopelessness and despair that
face the Palestinians each day of their lives.  In order to cure any disease,
a careful diagnosis is first made of the ailment and then proper treatment
prescribed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	When settlements stop, when demolition of Palestinian
houses halts, when collective punishment becomes a thing of the past, when
Palestinians are allowed to live as free citizens on their own land with
justice and dignity, when there is no fear of arrest or harassment, then
one can talk about reviving the peace talks. Suicide bombings are a result
of all these frustrations and so much more. When any people continue to
be deprived of their rights, their land and their dignity, they will fight
back, for they have nothing left to lose.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	When Ms. Albright spoke out against Palestinian resistance
at a meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman, she backed Israeli demands
that the PA crack down on Islamists and stressed that, &quot;We are with
you in the battle against terror and the struggle for security.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But the creation of the state of Israel and its continuing
infringement on Palestinian rights is the greatest form of terrorism and
has been waged by wars, by the slaughter of innocent people, by mass arrests,
by collective punishment, by the use of torture, by assassinations, by the
confiscation of more Palestinian property, by the takeover of Palestinian
homes by Zionist intruders, by the demolition of Palestinian homes and by
separating the West Bank and Gaza into two enormous concentration camps.
How can anyone speak of peace, of justice, of putting an end to resistance
when this ongoing tyranny occurs on a daily basis?  And who is this security
for? Is this just an elation to be enjoyed only by Israelis?  Since 1948,
Palestinians have not known the meaning of what it is to feel secure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And just how can the United States be a sincere mediator
in the Middle East when every American statesman and president pays allegiance
to not only the very powerful Jewish lobby within the U.S. but to the Israelis
themselves?  Indeed, lest it not be forgotten, it is American money in the
first place that has made Israel the force that it is today and it is American
money that has not only supported Israeli settlements on what is left of
Palestinian land, but paid for them as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Whenever peace occurs, it does so because two conflicting
sides want it to. Peace for Israel is only a means to accomplish what it
was not able to in war and to continue to push the Palestinians off their
land and into a state of desperation that is like a time bomb just waiting
to explode. Suicide bombers blow themselves and others up in an attempt
to secure freedom for the living and the right for the Palestinians to live
on their own land without fear and with dignity as a people who are entitled
to their inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Though Ms. Albright has been pronounced a brilliant stateswoman,
she accomplished nothing on her Mideast tour and returned home empty-handed.
She may have impressed a few Arab dignitaries, but the cold and hard fact
remains that there is no peace and that the Palestinians are more oppressed
and more tyrannized than ever before.  If war begins in the minds of men,
so must peace as well.  The real art of diplomacy would be to bring Israel
to terms with its own intransigence and violation of not only Palestinian
rights, but also human rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Ms. Albright stated, &quot;I am not a magician.&quot;
 But magic is not really needed to bring about peace.  What is needed is
the cessation of Israeli unilateral acts that create more tension and the
beginning of Israeli sincerity to bring about a peace that includes all.
