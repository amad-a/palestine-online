<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The drive-by shootings of two security guards from the
Israeli Embassy  in Jordan on Monday signaled a deepening Arab mood of anger
and  resentment toward Israel over the stalemate in Mideast peacemaking..The
shooting underscores the bitter feelings among Arabs toward the  hard-line
policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom  they blame
for the deterioration of the U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace  process. <B><I>The

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>IT MUST have been a tense occasion. A car with Israeli
plates emerged from the dust of the Jordan valley and headed for the Palestinian
checkpoint at the entrance to Jericho. Inside were eight Israelis in Jewish
skullcaps. The policeman tensed and cocked his rifle as the driver wound
down his window.	What followed was one of the more bizarre moments in Israeli-Palestinian
relations. We are three families of Jews seeking political asylum,&quot;
the driver told the bewildered guards. According to those present. there
was a short silence before the entire police unit collapsed in laughter.
But the would-be refugees were in earnest. They said they had faced systematic
discrimination in Israel as Sephardic (Middle Eastern) Jews. The guards
stopped laughing and five minutes later. Djibril Rajoub, the head of the
Palestinian security police. was on the telephone asking to talk to them.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jewish settlers who, backed by an American millionaire,
are attempting to establish themselves in a Palestinian part of Jerusalem,
have reached agreement with the Israeli government on their future. But,
writes Patrick Cockburn, what is being presented as a compromise deal is
really a total victory.The American millionaire Irving Moskowitz has won
a near-total victory in his attempt to establish a new Jewish neighbourhood
in the previously Palestinian district of Ras al-Amoud in east Jerusalem.
Under a &quot;compromise&quot;, the present 11 Jewish settlers will be replaced
by 10 seminary students who will guard and renovate the largest villa they
have occupied.<B><I>The Independent,  September 20, 1997</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli television reported Friday that Yasser Arafat has
a serious  illness and that a search for a successor has begun. But people
close to  Arafat denied the report, saying the 68-year-old Palestinian leader
is  in good health. Israel TV's Channel 2, citing Western intelligence sources,
said  Arafat's illness affects his muscle control but not his mental  condition.
It rebroadcast segments from an interview with Arafat last  week in which
the Palestinian leader's lower lip quivered u ncontrollably.  The tremor
is only one of the symptoms of his illness, said Channel 2  reporter Yoram
Binur, who would not say what illness Arafat allegedly  suffers from. <B><I>The

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meeting in Abha, a provincial capital in southwest Saudi
Arabia, with  foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries,
she ( US Secretary of State Madeleine  Albright) drew  laughs by noting
that she is &quot;different in one way from previous  secretaries of state&quot;
- that is, a woman. In future sessions, she told  the representatives of
the conservative, male-dominated sheikdoms, &quot;I  hope we can speak about
the role of women in your societies and the  world.&quot;	But she had two
foreign policy messages for them, too: The United States  wants them to
do more to cut off financial support to &quot;terrorist&quot; groups,  such
as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and it wants them to take part in the  fourth
annual Arab-Israeli economic conference, scheduled to be held in  Qatar
in November. <B><I>The Washington Post, September 15, 1997</I></B></FONT></P>
