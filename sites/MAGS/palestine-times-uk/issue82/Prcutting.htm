<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli army deployed troop reinforcements and armoured
cars yesterday in an attempt to contain rioting which spread across the
West Bank after three Palestinian workers were shot dead at a military checkpoint...&quot;One
of the workers, Ikab Sayed Ahmed, opened the door and was shouting in Hebrew,
'We are workers,' but the shooting carried on.&quot; Later soldiers pulled
the 37 year-old out of the minibus and laid him on the road beside the bodies
of his friends. 	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The [Israeli] Supreme Court has again ventured down a slippery
slope in  the area of human rights. Through the court's repeated backing,
 administrative detention has become a routine phenomenon, and as a  result
hundreds of Palestinians are being held in prolonged captivity  without
trial, under pretext that they pose a threat to local security. Now the
Supreme Court has put its stamp of approval on a new disgrace. In a ruling
handed down four months ago and partially made public last  week, it has
authorized the continued detention of Lebanese citizens who  have been imprisoned
for many years, simply because they can be  ''bargaining chips'' in an effort
to locate and release [Israeli]  soldiers who are captive or missing in
action.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Did he blunder and give comfort to Israel's enemies or
was he  candidly expressing what he and many Israelis in their hearts believe?
 Either way, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak's remark last week that if he
 had been born a Palestinian, he might have joined one of the groups  fighting
Israel has erupted into a major political flap for the former  army chief
who wants Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's job. Right-wing politicians
are exploiting the comment, saying Barak has  provided some legitimacy for
groups like Hamas that have wreaked havoc  in Israel... But some Israelis
have come forth to say that Barak was only stating an  obvious truth, that
if Israelis were in the Palestinians' shoes, their  actions might be similar.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After several years of squandering aid money on a corrupt
and unaccountable Palestinian Authority, the European Union has been complaining
recently about not being accorded a constructive role in the Mideast peace
process. Now that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered
to withdraw troops from Southern Lebanon if the conditions are right, the
EU has that chance. The question is whether members will seize it, or continue
trying to make themselves an &quot;honest broker&quot; in the sexier Palestinian
conflict.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The reaction to last week's Vatican statement on the Holocaust
was  decidedly mixed. Jewish leaders tended to be polite but did not disguise
 their disappointment. On the other hand, Roman Catholic commentators  tended
to be positive. One is tempted to say self-congratulatory. Rabbi David Rosen,
director of the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation  League and a liaison
with the Vatican, acknowledged the statement's  import but called it ''disappointing
in certain respects.'' He pointed  out - correctly, in my judgment - that
earlier statements by the  Catholic bishops of France and Germany went further
in accepting  responsibility for the moral climate that allowed Nazism to
flourish in  Christian (and largely Catholic) Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> After months of stalemate and under pressure from the
 U.S., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent President  Clinton
a compromise offer on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. While the
withdrawal Netanyahu proposes is smaller than the one the  United States
is suggesting, it would cede more land than Israel has  been willing to
give up in the past. And the proposal would offer the  Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, more adjacent land; Palestinians have  complained Israel
was offering them isolated patches.</FONT></P>

 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fierce reaction by the Netanyahu government against
even offering  the (American) plan is said to have taken the Americans by
surprise. Netanyahu twice called President Clinton directly last week, he
has dispatched  other officials to Washington, and he has encouraged the
heads of  Jewish-American groups to try to intervene. So far, the Clinton
 administration is reported to have refused the entreaties... The details
of the American plan have been widely reported, and were  thought by American
officials to be only a modest advancement of the  Israeli position. The
U.S. plan would call for Israeli withdrawal in  stages from a further 13.1
percent of the West Bank, and Israel has  hinted that it might agree to
9 percent.</FONT></P>
