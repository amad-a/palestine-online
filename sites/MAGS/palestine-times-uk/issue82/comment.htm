<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Sins of Oslo</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is amply clear by now that very few dignified Palestinians
are still harbouring any illusions about the &quot;merits&quot; of sticking
to the deformed agreement called the &quot;Oslo Accords.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, whose
PA is the main brat of Oslo, now recognizes, though somewhat belatedly,
the &quot;scandalous flaws&quot; inherent in that agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On many occasions, Arafat pointed out that &quot;if the
opposition can cite one flaw in the agreement, I can cite a thousand flaws.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat, a man who accords little regard to honesty, said
on the eve of the agreement that it would culminate in an independent Palestinian
State with Jerusalem as its capital. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the former Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres,
who co-engineered the agreement, was quick to rebuke Arafat for his excessive
wishful thinking and distorted interpretation of Oslo by saying &quot;I
can't prevent Arafat from dreaming.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, from the very inception, the agreement was vague to
the extent that both parties were able to hold substantially different and
even diametrically opposed understandings and interpretations of it--otherwise
it would have been reached. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Needless to say, the vagueness always worked in Israel's
favour, since the Labor government, and even more so the current Likud government,
sought to translate its peculiar understanding of the agreement into tangible
facts in Jerusalem as well as the rest of the Occupied Territories, which
thanks to the agreement ceased to be &quot;occupied territories&quot; and
became instead &quot;disputed territories.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To this the Palestinian Authority reacted by making loud
noises that made little impression, if any, on &quot;the one and only sponsor
of the peace process,&quot; the United States.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, that has exactly been the pattern since the conclusion
of Oslo and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, whereby the
Israelis would build more Jewish settlements, confiscate more Arab land,
destroy more Palestinian homes, and narrow Palestinian horizons on a daily
basis while the PA would make vociferous but innocuous protestations, imploring
a hypocritical world to &quot;save the peace process&quot; and warning of
&quot;dire consequences if Israeli intransigence is not checked.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Americans, let alone the Israelis, understood all along
Arafat's dilemma. They knew from the outset that he had no choice but to
stick to Oslo because PA survival depended on Oslo, and the undoing of Oslo
would necessarily mean the termination of the PA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More to the point, the Americans and the Israelis sought
to make use of that dilemma to its fullest potential, e.g. by forcing designs
on Arafat that would effectively liquidate the Palestinian question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat himself made strident steps in budging to American-Israeli
dictates.  He agreed (according to a recent security memorandum presented
to Israel and the United States) to allow Israeli and American agents to
decide who of the Palestinians would be arrested and how long he or she
would stay in jail. He also agreed to report to his two &quot;partners&quot;
regularly on the activities of the &quot;opposition.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nonetheless, the Chairman's disgraceful submission has
had no effect on the Israeli government's frenzied settlement expansion
in the West Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu said plainly that
he would not &quot;give away&quot; the &quot;land of Israel&quot; to the
Palestinians. He added that in any prospective settlement with the Palestinians,
Israel would still keep more than 60% of the West Bank.  Jerusalem is, of
course, non-negotiable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other words, the Israeli stance vis-?-vis the Palestinians
is &quot;what you see is what you get, and don't ask for more because you
won't get anything.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Certainly, the Israelis and the Americans would be more
than happy to bring about cosmetic improvements here and there and would
also be especially generous in offering economic aide and financial incentives
to Arafat's notoriously corrupt Authority in return for agreeing to &quot;settle
for a bird in the hand is better than ten in the bush.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, there are no genuine indications that Arafat
and his money-grabbing sycophants won't settle for that. They most probably
will.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But that won't be the end of it. In fact, it would mean
that the conflict would take its full historical course, which in turn would
end in Israel's ultimate demise and disappearance, like the Crusades.</FONT></P>
