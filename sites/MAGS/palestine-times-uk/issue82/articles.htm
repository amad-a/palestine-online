<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israelis Slap Britain on the Face</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Azzam Tamimi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who visited Palestine
in March as a representative of the European Union, is now a hero in the
eyes of the Palestinians, the Arabs and the Muslims. It seems that he may
not have had much leverage to push the peace process forward or to persuade
the Israelis to halt their illegal settlement programme in Jerusalem. However,
he may have, as the Israeli ambassador in London stated in a BBC television
interview, provoked the Israelis-or, more accurately, provided them with
the pretext (not that they really need one)--to defy, as blatantly as they
are capable of, the International Community by confiscating more Palestinian
land to expand or build additional settlements. He may have provoked the
Zionist lobby in Britain, and he may have to be made to pay for his heroic
stance as Miller did before him. But he has certainly succeeded in standing
up to the Israelis in a manner rarely seen among Western politicians. And
in doing so, he has spoken on behalf of millions of Britons, who constitute
a large silent majority, fed up with the Zionist arrogance and blackmail
(to use the words of a young British journalist who intimated that many
more British intellectuals and journalists support Palestinian rights now
than ever before). Indeed, the insulting treatment of Mr. Cook by the Israelis
has outraged many British commentators. Some dared to speak openly while
some expressed dismay and anger only privately. A British politician is
reported to have intimated in a small gathering with Arab businessmen that
the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu behaved like a recalcitrant, thankless
child. It was the British who promised to give the Jews Palestine as their
national home; it was the British who prepared the ground for the creation
of the State of Israel; and it is the British who have been supporting the
right of the State of Israel to exist peacefully and securely in the Middle
East. Now, all the British get is a slap on the face and a kick in the butt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Cook's visit to Palestine could not have come at a
better time for the Palestinians. The Israelis had been making one provocation
after the other, and the beleaguered Palestinians wished for someone like
Mr. Cook to come and see for himself and to listen to complaints about the
continuing Israeli disregard for the basic rights of the Palestinians. Days
before Cook departed for Palestine, a Commission of Inquiry set up by the
Israeli Government to investigate the attempted assassination in Amman in
September 1997 of Khaled Misha'al, a Hamas official, showed very clearly
the arrogance of the Israelis. The Commission concentrated on the failure
of the attack rather than its illegality. Its report has been described
by Amnesty International as 'shocking in its contempt for a rule of law
in which justice and human rights are respected.' Israel, which has since
its creation blackmailed the Western world in the name of fighting terrorism,
received Cook with a series of scandals exposed by the discovery of a number
of failed illegal espionage operations in Europe, specifically in Switzerland
and Britain. It also received Cook with its decision to release the Israeli
soldiers who killed in cold blood three Palestinian labourers at a checkpoint
on their way back home from work. Cook was also received with a statement
of defiance by Ariel Sharon, Israeli Infrastructure Minister and former
Israeli Defence Minister responsible for the massacre of thousands of civilian
Palestinians in Lebanon. Sharon told Israeli television that Israel would
still want to assassinate Khaled Misha'al and would once more try to execute
him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meantime, the Palestinian Authority (PA) is being
pushed to the limit. No progress is taking place in the peace process, and
the economic situation in the territories has only been getting worse. By
now, not a single Palestinian inside Gaza and the West Bank doubts the real
nature of the Oslo peace settlement and the real function of the PA. The
image of the PA as a guard employed by Israel to contain the Palestinians
and provide protection for Jewish settlers and Israeli troops has, more
than any time since the signing of the Oslo agreement in 1993, become annoying
and truly humiliating for the PA leadership. It is believed that recent
angry statements by senior PA officials, especially in the wake of the murder
of the three Palestinian labourers, have been purposely sanctioned by the
leadership in order to salvage its rapidly deteriorating reputation (not
that it has not already been fatally damaged). At a press conference in
Hebron, Al Rajoub, the notorious PA security chief, threatened that in response
to the Israeli soldiers' attack on the Palestinians, the Palestinians would
not, from then on, guarantee the safety of any Jewish settler to enter the
zone under direct PA security control. Some Palestinian media even reported
the statement in a much stronger claim, attributing to Al Rajoub (a relative
of whom was one of the three labourers killed) the warning that &quot;from
now on, any Jewish settler to enter our area will not leave it alive.&quot;
This was too much for the Israelis, who strongly protested and asked him
to apologize. However, the more serious development in this regard has been
the statement made to Egyptian journalists by the PA-appointed Mufti of
Jerusalem, Sheikh 'Ikrema Sabri. He defended suicide bombers and considered
the killing of Israeli women and children legitimate in view of the continuing
Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians. Sheikh 'Ikrema even refused to
condemn Palestinians who oppose peace with Israel and condoned the attitude
of Friday Prayer imams who criticize the peace process and call for a resumption
of armed struggle against Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It may turn out that these statements do not reflect a
real change in PA policy or a wavering of its declared commitment to the
peace process. In fact, they may have been designed primarily to improve
the image of the PA by playing to the tune of the Palestinian opposition,
whose position has been vindicated in the light of the Israeli government's
repeated slaps on the face of Yasser Arafat and his PA comrades. However,
it is possible that these PA-sanctioned declarations may have been in anticipation
of the resumption of military attacks on Israeli targets to avenge the killing
of the three Palestinian workers. After all, it has been quite some time,
thanks primarily to the role of the PA in monitoring and aborting potential
attacks against the Israelis, since the last major operation was executed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not uncommon now to hear frustrated Palestinians
shout (in demonstrations and funerals) and whisper (behind closed doors
and into the ears of senior PA officials) that their being humiliated at
the hands of the Israelis is the fault of the PA, whose main concern is
to protect the Israelis rather than the Palestinians. It is time, many Palestinians
believe, that the Israelis should be made to pay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The new PA rhetoric is indeed a source of anxiety for the
Israelis, who see in it a sign of rapprochement between the PA and its critics
within the Palestinian community, and possibly a sign of covert coordination
and cooperation between some factions of the PA and Israel's arch-enemy,
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). In the aftermath of the killing
of the three Palestinian workers, Hamas issued a statement vowing to retaliate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israelis should be worried that any act of retaliation
by Hamas will be designed to punish the Israelis, not only for the murder
of the three Palestinians, but also for their failed assassination attempt
on the life of Misha'al and for Sharon's insistence that it would be repeated.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>West Bank seethes in anger following Tarqumya
carnage</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron- From Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The seemingly deliberate murder of three Palestinian labourers
by Israeli soldiers at the Tarqumya junction on 10 March ignited a &quot;mini
intifadah&quot; throughout the occupied territories. Sporadic but violent
clashes between stone-hurling Palestinian protesters and heavily armed Israeli
soldiers erupted in Hebron, Dura, Bethlehem, Ramallah and other localities
in the West Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ten days after the Tarqumya bloodbath, violent clashes
were still taking place in Hebron and other localities, especially after
the death of 11-year-old Samer Karameh early on Tuesday, 17 March. He succumbed
to his critical injury sustained the previous week when Israeli soldiers
opened fire at a group of Palestinian youngsters protesting the Tarqumya
carnage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to sources at the Al Ahli hospital in Hebron,
Karameh had been &quot;clinically dead&quot; ever since his admission to
hospital on Wednesday, 11 March. Hospital Administrator Dr. Yousef al Sharawi
told &quot;Palestine Times&quot; that a rubber-coated metal bullet (inaccurately
referred to as just &quot;rubber bullets&quot;) pierced the child's brain
causing a massive and fatal hemorrhage. A few days later, the child was
pronounced dead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Hebron, most of the unrest occurred at and around the
Bab El Zawiya neighbourhood and nearby Shallala Street, the so-called &quot;friction
line&quot; separating the PA-administered area, known as H-1, and the Israeli-controlled
Old Town, known as H-2, where the Ibrahimi Mosque in located. Generally
speaking, the protests assumed a hit-and-run fashion whereby Palestinian
protesters, mostly youngsters and students, hurled stones toward (rather
than at or even on) fairly distant and fully armed Israeli soldiers, who
responded with the often-lethal rubber-coated metal bullets, eventually
killing the child Karameh. As of Tuesday, 17 March, over 50 other Palestinians
had been injured.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The unrest took an ugly turn on Friday night, 13 March,
when Israeli settlers celebrating a Jewish holiday entered the PA-administered
area, attacking Palestinians and vandalizing property. However, when Palestinian
cameramen sought to videotape the frantic rampage, Israeli soldiers stationed
on neighbouring rooftops opened fire on the journalists, injuring eight
of them. Of the eight, journalist Nael Shuyokhi was seriously injured.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ostensibly deliberate shooting at the Palestinian cameramen
was apparently meant to intimidate Palestinian and other journalists and
cameramen and deter them from &quot;crossing the red lines,&quot; e.g. filming
the settlers while re-enacting their own crystal nacht, this time in Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Protesting the shooting, more than 25 Palestinian journalists
and cameramen organized a demonstration in Hebron during which they carried
their cameras on stretchers to dramatize the real perils facing them while
covering events in the occupied territories. One sign carried by the journalists
read, &quot;Don't kill the messenger,&quot; and another said, &quot;I'm
a journalist; don't kill me.&quot; The protesting journalists then held
a press conference at Hebron City Hall where they called on their colleagues
around the world to identify with their plight and to try to exert pressure
on the Israeli government to stop attacks on journalists. According to Naim
Tubasi, head of the Palestinian Journalist Union, 54 Palestinian journalists
have been moderately-to-seriously injured by Israeli gunfire since September
1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elsewhere in the West Bank, thousands of mostly Islamist
demonstrators set ablaze American and Israeli flags in Nablus to protest
the Tarqumya carnage. The protesters marched toward an Israeli military
position in Nablus, shouting &quot;Gestapo, Gestapo&quot; at Israeli soldiers.
The demonstrators were eventually repulsed by PA police using tear-gas to
disperse them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Dura, 13 miles southwest of Hebron, the three murdered
labourers were laid to rest on Wednesday, 11 March, in a solemn procession
unprecedented in the Town's history. An eyewitness to the carnage, who is
also a survivor of it, related that Israeli soldiers continued to open fire
at the workers even as they were screaming &quot;we are workers, we are
workers.&quot; Hamdan Rajoub, who narrowly escaped the soldiers' bullets,
stressed that the car posed no threats whatsoever to the lives of the soldiers,
adding that they &quot;killed in cold blood for the sake of killing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the murder of the three apolitical and poor labourers
was a stunning surprise in Dura. Sheikh Nayef Rajoub, imam of the Grand
Mosque in Dura, eulogized the three workers before their burial and ridiculed
the Israeli account of the incident. He asked, &quot;What would make those
poor workers who were returning to their families provoke the heavily armed
and trigger-happy Israeli soldiers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Rajoub pointed out that the massacre of the three
workers had no effect on the Israeli collective conscience and that the
opposite was true, since Israeli political circles, as well as the press,
criticized the brief questioning of the three soldiers who committed the
crime.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This lays out naked the evil mentality of our enemy
to such an extent that one is forced to wonder how can we possibly make
peace with a society as such,&quot; Rajoub said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Initially, the Israeli army said the shots were fired from
the Palestinian car prompting the soldiers to return fire. Then, a few hours
later, an Israeli army spokesman said the car was trying to run over one
of the soldiers, a charge which nearly a hundred eyewitnesses said, &quot;It
is concocted and has no iota of truth.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Adding insult to injury</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Tarqumya atrocity and its aftermath enraged an already
exasperated Palestinian public opinion. First, the Palestinians were enraged
by the cold-blooded murder of three day labourers, who never posed any danger
to anybody, as their main preoccupation was to earn bread for their children.
Second, a further outrage resulted from the exoneration and subsequent release
of the three Jewish killers only after spending 13 hours in a token incarceration.
Third, and most gruesome of all, the Palestinian got a rather phantasmagoric
collective image of the Israeli precipitin of Palestinians and non-Jews.
Indeed, there was an outcry in Israel following the incident. However, the
affronting thing is that the outcry was not over the murder of the three
Palestinian labourers, but rather over the &quot;unjust incarceration of
the three soldiers.&quot; In other words, the crime from the collective
Israeli viewpoint was not the butchering of the three Palestinians, but
the incarceration for 13 hours of the three butchers. In fact, an Israeli
government minister, Transportation Minister Joshua Yahlom, was audacious
enough to demand that the military officer who ordered the incarceration
of the three soldiers be dismissed from service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The release of the three soldiers and the ensuing outcry
over their brief detention left a predictably bitter impression on Palestinians,
who evidently wrongly thought the Israeli society was making a transition
from the psychology of war to the psychology of peace.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat's entrapment!</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Musil J. Shihadeh*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat is a sitting duck in the middle of the crossfire
between the Israeli Likud government that humiliates him by dictating to
him the unacceptable terms of total surrender and the Palestinian masses
that cannot acquiesce to the same terms. On one hand, he has made a commitment
to the world to abandon armed struggle in exchange for achieving an honourable
peace through negotiations, while on the other hand he is getting nothing
from the Israeli government except the crumbs thrown at him from the Israeli
table of &quot;peace&quot;. In the light of statements made by Israeli officials
on the future of the West Bank, the future of the so-called Palestinian
&quot;State&quot; is going down the drain into oblivion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As time goes on, the clandestine Israeli plans for the
West Bank unravel a grotesque and gloomy picture of what the future Palestinian
State would look like. I cannot, with all honesty, call them &quot;cantons&quot;,
since the inhabitants of such subdivisions would still enjoy freedom of
motion and equal rights and protection under a higher authority. The Israeli
new lines of entrapment would chain the Palestinian &quot;cantons&quot;,
and the higher authority would be in Israeli hands. I think it would be
more appropriate to call the future Palestinian State a collection of subdivided
ghettoes, where the oppressed masses would have to be satisfied to accept
sub-human conditions of survival. Geographically, this Lilliputian &quot;State&quot;
would be dissected into many parts in order to accommodate the passage of
super-highways connecting the Jewish settlements, over 165 of them (and
still increasing), with Israel proper. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In retrospect, the pre-Oslo status quo is far more superior
to the planned future; at least then, the hope for a viable independent
State was still an achievable goal. In essence, the peace negotiations,
which basically brought to the forefront the demands sought by Israel since
its creation, are nothing more than a stratagem to continue its expansionist
policies, but in the name of &quot;peace&quot;. The obvious results have
been the radicalization of the Palestinian masses in the direction of extremism,
which would signal a new bloody beginning of violence and bloodshed that
will claim many victims on both sides. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From this perspective Israeli leadership is myopic in its
outlook for the future, since injustice and oppression will always breed
new violence irrespective of the strength of the oppressor and by no means
can avoid such a bleak future except to redress the justified grievances
of the oppressed. One does not need to consult a political scholar or an
educated historian to arrive at this sad conclusion as a sincere study of
colonialism and tyranny versus the oppressed throughout history should confirm
this inevitable conclusion. It should behoove the Israeli leadership to
keep this in mind before they sink deep into a new misadventure on the Palestinian
front. It should also behoove Mr. Arafat to seek other options before his
leadership is held responsible for participating with Israel in the futile
attempt to kill the modest dreams of the Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Infidelity, religion, and gun-boat diplomacy
:- crisis in the region </FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Dr. Daud A. Abdullah*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When Hillary Clinton appeared on American television last
month to dispel claims of her husband's sexual impropriety she accused a
right-wing cabal in Washington of attempting to destroy the President. The
First Lady, a lawyer by profession, was not afraid to name names. For after
five years in the byzantine circles of Capitol Hill she had come to know
of most of the protagonists in this festering scandal. Hence, without giving
much credence to the likes of Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, and Paula
Jones, Mrs. Clinton pointed the finger of accusation straight at the very
Rev. Jerry Falwell. She had, apparently, no doubt that he was the mastermind
of the disturbing revelations which shook the foundations of the American
political establishment and sent shock waves as far away as the Middle East.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So who is this man Jerry Falwell; and why should he want
to bring a premature end to the Clinton presidency? Is it because the latter
has failed to live up to the puritan ideals of Protestant America? Of course
not. The issue at stake here is not one of marital infidelity or even perjury,
as sections of the American media would have us believe. A careful assessment
of the facts indicates that the bone of contention between the President
and Rev. Falwell is one of politics and support for Zionist-Israel and its
religio-nationalistic policies in the Middle East. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The religious right</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two days before news of the Lewinsky affair hit the news
waves of the world, Israel's prime minister Benyamin Netanyaho had met privately
with Jerry Falwell and other evangelical leaders in Washington. The purpose
of the meeting according to Falwell was to mobilize the evangelical churches
against American attempts to force Israel to give up more Palestinian territory
in the West Bank and Gaza. In a press statement issued on 20 January Falwell
declared; &quot;There are about 200,000 evangelical pastors in America,
and we are asking them all through e-mail, faxes, letters, telephone, to
go to their pulpits and use their influence in support of the state of Israel
and the prime minister.&quot; In retrospect, statements of this kind are
not entirely surprising since Falwell himself was awarded the highest Zionist
honor: The Jabotinsky Prize for service rendered to Israel, plus $100 million
from Israel and $140 million from the Swaggert donation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In reality, Zionist courtship of western Christendom did
not begin with either Netanyaho or Falwell. Bearing in mind that the entire
settler project in Palestine was founded on western non-Jewish Zionist support.
Indeed, the notion that the Second Coming of Christ would not be fulfilled
until the Jews had returned to Palestine had gained currency in English
literature as early as the 1640s. It continued to attract followers in every
historical period after the Reformation and culminated in the 20th. century
American fundamentalism which claims that the state of Israel represents
the fulfillment of prophecy in modern history. It was against this background
that the Time (21 June 1976) recorded former President Carter's declaration
to a gathering at the Synagogue of Elizabeth in New Jersey; &quot;I honor
the same God as you. We (Baptists) study the same Bible as you.&quot; And
on account of this, &quot;The survival of Israel does not come down to politics.
It is a moral duty.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel's use of banned weapons</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With regard to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the central
issue in the current crisis, the Israelis have since 1967 been very critical
of American Christian leaders for not supporting their expansionist adventure
in the territories. Writing in the New York Times (June 27, 1967) Rabbi
Pesach Levowitz, President of the Rabbinical Council of America, &quot;Expressed
deep disappointment&quot; with what he called the failure of &quot;major
segments of the world and American Christian community to raise their voices
in defence of Israel...&quot; Later on that same year, the UN Security Council
unanimously passed resolution 242; &quot;Emphasizing the inadmissibility
of the acquisition of territory by war.&quot; Yet, the fact that the resolution
only demanded the &quot;withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories,&quot;
and not &quot;all' or &quot;the&quot; territories gave Israel a technical
loophole to maintain its occupation which has continued until today. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By law, the same principles used by the UN to determine
the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war in 1967, should
naturally also be applied to the territories which Israel captured in 1948.
As a consequence, Israel must be made to surrender the territory which it
seized in 1948 and which the General Assembly actually declared should be
part of the Palestinian state. Any formula which fails to make these provisions
will certainly reinforce the widespread belief throughout the Arab world
that Israel is above international law. This conviction has, as a matter
fact, become much stronger in the light of the current mobilization of American
and British forces in the Arab Gulf.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although the professed objective of the immanent attack
upon Iraq is to deny it the capacity to produce chemical and biological
weapons, observers are absolutely appalled by the fact that Israel is allowed
to stockpile and use unconventional weapons against its neighbors. The International
Commission which met in Nicosia to investigate Israeli crimes in Lebanon
in 1982 confirmed that the Zionist state did extensively use phosphorous
and napalm bombs during its invasion of that country. Canadian and Greek
doctors testifying before the Commission recalled that many civilian casualties
were so disfigured by burns from napalm and phosphorous bombs that the holes
in their bodies made them resemble filters.2 Israel's continued and indiscriminate
use of these banned weapons has, evidently, escalated in recent years. Despite
their persistent official denials, a former Israeli commander in southern
Lebanon, Ephraim Sneh, admitted in 1996 that his country used tank-fired
shells filled with flachettes in Lebanon.3 A flachette shell is an antipersonnel
weapon that contains ten to fourteen thousand 1.5 inch steel darts which
when released from a canister, spread out in an arc that can reach a maximum
width of about ninety-four yards. It is therefore significant to recall
here that while Israel receives the technical assistance and other benefits
of being a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it continues
to refuse to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and accordingly
subject itself to the same inspection and monitoring regime that 180 other
countries are subjected to by the IAEA. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Israel attempted
to shoot down the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft SR-71 when it flew over the
secret nuclear sight at Dimona while transporting arms to Israel. The Chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, Admiral Thomas L. Moorer,
reported that after correctly identifying the aircraft on their radar, the
Israelis ordered its downing in order to shield their nuclear facilities.
The plane only escaped because it was flying too high for the Israeli fighters
to reach. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the basis of this evidence, it is abundantly clear that
Israel's past record and current conduct is no less macabre than Iraq's.
For it is prepared to attack not just its enemies but even its friends to
maintain its nuclear capacity. At any rate, since both the United States
and Israel have themselves refused to sign existing international conventions
banning the use of biological weapons, the underlying motives for attacking
Iraq have become entirely suspect and reprehensible. There are, indeed,
tangible evidence which suggest that the operation to dismember and cripple
Iraq was conceived in Jerusalem long before the invasion of Kuwait. In February
1982 the World Zionist Organization disclosed in its review, Kivounim (Orientations),
that; &quot;The disintegration of Syria and Iraq into regions, based on
ethnic or religious criteria, must be, in the long term, a primary goal
for Israel; the first step is the destruction of the military power of these
states.&quot; Thus, &quot;Oil-rich, and victim of internal strife, Iraq
is in the Israeli firing line. Its dissolution would be, for us, more important
than Syria's, because it is Iraq, in the short term, that represents the
more serious threat for Israel.&quot;4 That the economic and military strangulation
of Iraq should take place at a time when the Zionist lobby in Washington
has taken full control of American foreign and defence policies is therefore
not at all surprising. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What is to be done</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What is however deeply disturbing is that in the post Cold
War era, European policy toward the Middle East has remained essentially
unchanged. By maintaining their traditional loyalty and &quot;special relationship&quot;
with the United States, the Europeans have inadvertently delayed the modernization
of their role in the region. For whereas the evolution of the modern state
should actually reflect a corresponding development in its foreign policy,
this has not been demonstrated in European involvement in the Middle East.
Quite to the contrary, it has persisted as the appendage of an American
approach which mainly relies upon military force in an age when political,
economic and cultural discourse have become extremely imperative. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In certain ways though, the present crisis in the region
has brought to the fore the underlying differences between the major European
powers and their inability to deal with the United States as a unified body.
French opposition to the use of force in Iraq is a good example of this.
Albeit that it is really through their collective power that the European
Union would ultimately enhance the influence of its individual members.
Having upheld the traditions of democracy and self-determination which secured
the independence of Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America
itself, the Europeans and Britain in particular would restore much of their
lost credibility if they were to show similar concern for the 3 million
Palestinians who have lived under Israeli military occupation for the past
thirty years. Not to say the least of their estimated 4 million kith and
kin who have since 1948 been consigned to a stateless existence throughout
the world. Thus, in the same way that the European Union has resisted U.S.
pressure to impose sanctions on European companies trading with Iran, so
too they can and ought to resist American attempts to solve the complex
political problems of the Middle east through military means.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several lessons have already been learnt from the current
crisis. That in the last decade of the 20th.century, national sovereignty
has become more the legal basis by which the economic and political freedom
of all peoples can be safeguarded. Similarly, that sovereignty itself is
indivisible. For either a state has the right to act independently or it
does not. Hence, whether it be Iraq, Palestine or Kuwait, every state must
have the ultimate power to determine its destiny and decide its own affairs
if it is to become truly sovereign. Finally, that real security comes more
from the values and &quot;ethical principles&quot; which give a country
its particular character. Therefore, the security which Israel and the United
States seek to achieve in the Middle East through the force of arms can
actually be attained more easily through other means. They entail respect
for the ideals of freedom and guarantee of the rights of all peoples in
the region, including the Palestinians to self-determination. Surely, national
security is neither exclusively, nor primarily, a military function. It
comes more importantly from the fair and just application of international
law to all peoples and without fear or favor. As Abraham Lincoln the American
patriarch had warned long ago; those who in the name of national security,
&quot;destroy the spirit that prizes liberty as the heritage of all men
in all lands everywhere&quot; have effectively &quot;planted the seeds of
despotism around your doors.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>How the Day was Won?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Muneer Shafiq*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was inevitable for the agreement between the Iraqi government
and Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to include
a clause binding Iraq to the implementation of Security Council resolutions
against it. Also inevitable was opening up for inspection all sites, including
Presidential Palaces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After all, that was what was requested of Iraq by almost
all Arab and Islamic States, and by the superpowers leaning Iraq-wise in
the crisis such as Russia, China and France. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither was Iraq opposed in principle to inspection even
as it prevented UNSCOM's team into the Palaces! Rather, it was clear from
the start that inspection was negotiable if Kofi Annan and the majority
of the Security Council would go along with proposed Iraqi changes to inspection
teams and with the setting of some kind of conception as to ending the state
of siege once the inspections were through.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Inspections then would be conducted within a definite time
frame, even under any maximum limit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why the U.S. government's battle revolved, diplomatically
speaking, around depriving Iraq from that element.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, the essence of the American position has been to
dominate inspection teams and to totally forfeit decision-making, especially
with regards to whence inspections are to be declared finished. With the
ill intention of leaving the sanctions indefinitely in place, this malicious
policy has thus far driven UNSCOM's inspection efforts for the past seven
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, (1) participating in inspection teams by other
members of the Security Council and giving them a supervising and chaperoning
role, (2) adjusting the structure of those teams, and 3) the implicit promising
thereof to lift the sanctions when the work of the born-again teams is over,
represents a political defeat all in all for U.S. foreign policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. Administration might try to sweep that defeat
under the rug by arguing that its demand of unrestricted access to all sites
has been achieved. Yet nothing can be more indicative of the truth of that
defeat more than U.S. Administration insistence that it reserves the right
to reject the Iraq-UN deal and to strike Iraq unilaterally, even before
Secretary-General Annan has had the opportunity to take the agreement to
the Security Council; doing otherwise would be tantamount to conceding diplomatic
defeat before Arab and Islamic States, and before Russia, China and France.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>True, the scale of the defeat was relatively small! But
with far-reaching and meaningful implications for the international balance-of-power,
nevertheless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But if the U.S. Administration didn't accept its diplomatic
defeat, it would then make a more grievous mistake by entering a war alone
without counting even on British support or with British reservations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Striking Iraq or entering a war in the midst of such international
isolation, and in the shadow of the confirmed deal between the UN and Iraq
would, however, make political defeat more certain and more macabre than
simply backing off by agreeing to the UN-brokered deal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's why Iraq &quot;did good&quot; by reaching that agreement
with Kofi Annan...</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A visit to Palestine</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Alison Browning</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For most of my life I have wanted to visit the Holy Land
of Palestine. I grew up in a very religious home, and the land of Palestine
was part of my daily life as each day we had to read the bible and pray.
Palestine was close to my heart although I am neither Jew nor Arab. My religious
upbringing urged me to have a great interest in the cause of the Palestinian
people and the Middle East in general.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It all began in Sunday school when I was maybe five or
six. We learned about how God wanted the Israelites to have the land of
Canaan, and they were told by God to go and totally wipe out the people
of the Canaanite city of Jericho. Even then I thought it was outrageous,
killing in the name of God. This attitude has existed in the minds of Zionists
and fundamentalist Christians since then with regard to the descendants
of those ancient people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I started to write to a political prisoner in an Israeli
jail eight years ago when I was a student. She was soon one of many political
prisoners with whom I corresponded but she was always the most special of
all my pen friends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At last my husband and I had the money to go to Palestine
and visit Intissar (that is my friend's name) and her family in East Jerusalem.
Intissar has a large family that includes a journalist, an academic and
a judge in Ramallah. They are a politically active family. After eight years
I was finally going to meet the family in person.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Upon my arrival at Tel Aviv airport, I was amazed at the
total absence of anything relating to the Palestinian people. No Arabic
signs and no evidence at all of Arabs; they seemed non-existent. Intissar
told me that her family had suffered harassment from airport officials as
they had arrived to meet us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As we drove to Jerusalem, I noticed how modern and western
Israeli areas were in comparison with Palestinian areas, and this was not
even Gaza, Palestine's Soweto. The Palestinians were completely under-class,
second-rate citizens, even the middle-class Palestinians. They were like
the blacks in South Africa under Apartheid and the Indians during the Raj.
Of course I knew this, I had read enough, but now I was actually witnessing
it for real. It was not fair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Besides visiting the holy places, I spent time with Intissar's
family and learned of their difficulties and the Israeli bureaucracy, especially
regarding the building of homes; Israelis can build where they like, Palestinians
get their houses knocked down if they go against the Israeli red tape.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One day, in order to enter a Jewish park near Jericho so
that Sara, one of the children, could play on the park equipment, Intissar's
husband Mohammed and cousin Waleed had to pretend they were Israelis. Arabs
are forbidden into the area. They are seen as terrorists. We attended the
engagement party of one of Intissar's sisters. It was a happy occasion,
attended by half the village of Silwan. They were making up for the many
celebrations that had been spoiled by the curfew imposed during the Intifadah.
Intissar had been unable to have a proper engagement party because of the
curfews and even her wedding day was spoiled by them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was good to be in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jericho, to
see the Palestinian flag flying and the people having some sort of control
over their own lives. But in old Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers, little more
than children, would harass the market stallholders and peddlers. They brandished
their batons and shouted at people; they threatened a group of teenage schoolboys
who had gathered to watch and protest as the soldiers harassed a stallholder.
There was chaos and a sudden rush of noise as a mass escape of vendors tryied
to hide away from the young soldiers. Two soldiers looked down from their
perch on the city walls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The biggest worry while we were there was the threat of
Western action against Iraq. The local people were very worried and did
not want this war to go ahead. We watched the demonstrations in Palestine
and Jordan on the television. There was a panic for gas masks, and Intissar's
uncle tried to get masks for the children. When he got to the shop, it was
closed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As we left the country, there was the dreadful two-hour
check-out that Mohammed had warned us about. He advised us of what to say
and what not to say. We should mention that we had been to the Palestinian-controlled
areas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When we were questioned, the childlike Israeli security
guard (these Israeli guards and soldiers were all so terribly young!) treated
us as if we were terrorists as soon as he learned the names of our friends.
I did not think it was such a sin to stay with an Arab family, but the questions
intensified as soon as he found out that our friends were Arab and Muslim.
The Orthodox Jews went through with ease and welcoming, polite manners from
the security guards. The young man questioning us took our passports, went
over to a group of his colleagues and then looked at us as if we were scum.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We were led to a room where every single item we had with
us was thoroughly checked over. No one smiled at us or spoke to us. They
said this was a necessary thing for our protection but that was it--no reassurance,
even though they were going through all our personal things. I felt violated
and out of control. They saw the gifts our friends had given us--Zatar,
Arabic coffee, sweets and pastries, and homemade olive oil. The young security
guard shouted something about &quot; Arabs&quot; as our gifts were held
up. They were all taken away for examination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The others in that room being searched were almost all
Arabs apart from us and a hippy with a German accent and another European
woman whose friend appeared to be Palestinian. I sat in front of the woman
searching our things and tried to be strong. I ordered her to careful with
our gifts and camera film and to put all the things back neatly. She was
very untidy but when I tried to tidy our things, she told me not to touch
our things.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I thought about life for any Palestinian traveler and thought
about how Intissar must have been treated when she was in prison. If they
were treating us like terrorists simply for having Palestinian friends,
what must a political prisoner suffer? All those beatings, torture, degradation
and dehumanizing abuse. The more I thought about the prejudice, the angrier
I became. I admit it, I cried, not so much for me and our humiliation but
more for their assuming Muslim or Arab equals terrorist! How dare they single
out anyone remotely connected with Palestinians!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I started to feel quite sick as the procedure came to an
end. A Palestinian man smiled at me and shrugged.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I have been to hell,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It's a disgrace,&quot; I said. &quot;We just happened
to visit our Palestinian friends. You must feel very angry.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This is the way it is,&quot; said the man, resigned
to his fate, probably very used to it by now. He had come from the USA to
visit family and had lost luggage because of this procedure. As we left
to be carefully escorted through passport control, I bid the man and his
wife farewell and good luck. Our escort scowled at me. She did not like
me talking with this man.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Israel, it is a security risk to be Arab or Muslim or
even to have friends who are Arab or Muslim. In Israeli eyes, all Arabs
are evil terrorists. They are unequal, second-class people. It is time things
were changed, time for the West to stop pointing the finger at Iraq all
the time and look at Israel for once. The West made the problems in the
Middle East because of their desire to assert control over the region; the
West made Saddam Hussein what he is; the West made Israel what it is. It
is their mess. If they wanted they could change things; if they wanted to,
real peace with true justice and equal rights for all would come at last
to this beautiful but sad country.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>&quot;Yes, We Support Peace in the Middle
East!&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ibrahim Alloush*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many of us are often awed by military, economic, or nuclear
power. But perhaps one of the greatest weapons a superpower can wield is
the ability to coin definitions and establish reference points.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Take the term &quot;Middle East&quot;, for example. During
the last century, when Western powers like Britain and France engaged in
a struggle to carve up the world into spheres of colonial influence, they
initially imparted the name &quot;Middle East&quot; to those regions that
are now countries like Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan in the middle of the
continent of Asia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The western-most part of South Asia, which includes the
countries of the Fertile Crescent--Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine--was
called the &quot;Near East&quot;. The &quot;Far East&quot; was reserved
for those regions on the Asian continent that are farthest WITH RESPECT
TO EUROPE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As the British Empire spread from what was then the &quot;Middle
East&quot;, and from Egypt in North Africa, into Palestine and Iraq after
the First World War, the concept of the Middle East broadened to encompass
all of the original plus other neighbouring areas as well. The term &quot;Near
East&quot; all but vanished in the twentieth century, as an expanded &quot;Middle
East&quot; displaced it. Thus, as a concept, the &quot;Middle East&quot;
represented a perspective by which European, especially British, colonialism
viewed and claimed lands and peoples that they intended to dominate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Today, the &quot;Middle East&quot; still remains a colonial
concept--the region, its markets and resources, as viewed through the eyes
of foreign invaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Consequently, adopting this concept alters or denies the
region's basic national and cultural identity: the &quot;Middle East&quot;
replaces the &quot;Arab Homeland&quot; or the &quot;Islamic World&quot;.
People cease to be Persian, Pakistani, Arab, or Muslim, and become stereotype-friendly
&quot;Middle Eastern&quot; instead! Then losing one's identity makes one's
domination much easier, and sets the stage for a divide-and-conquer strategy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, if one said: &quot;...the Arab or Islamic
world&quot;, then &quot;Israel&quot; would not belong in either definition
because it's neither Arab nor Islamic. That's why terms like the &quot;Middle
East&quot; are jammed down our throats daily by the mainstream media in
order to dilute the essential identity of the region, and thus make room
for what would have been recognized otherwise as nothing but a foreign occupation,
physically and culturally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence we begin to accept oppressive occupation once we
present even a Palestinian, Arab, or Islamic point of view on the peace
process in the so-called &quot;Middle East&quot;. Does a lamb call itself
&quot;dinner&quot;?!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The &quot;Middle East&quot; is a declaration of cultural
war on the peoples of the region and an attempt to mystify then liquidate
their true identity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the main difference between all of the past conflicts
in the region, and the one with &quot;Israel&quot;, is that the latter has
never been, and will never be, part of the cultural tradition of the region
it seeks to subjugate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, terms like &quot;Israel&quot; and &quot;Middle
East&quot; need to be quarantined in quotations here, not out of sarcasm,
but as a way of resisting normalization with what infringes on one's identity,
dignity, or rights--just like certain expletives in reference to some minority
groups in the U.S. The name of the land is Palestine (without quotations).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To illustrate the point on how the &quot;Middle East&quot;
is necessary for &quot;Israel&quot;, I cite the following example:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli flag, a Star of David bordered by two stripes
of blue, was designed to represent an old Zionist principle, which is that
the land of the promised Israel (symbolized by the Star of David), is to
lie between the two major rivers of the region (as symbolized by the two
stripes of blue), namely the Nile river in Egypt and Sudan, and the Euphrates
in Turkey, Syria and Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet these territorial ambitions are not presented in the
media as the real cause for instability in the &quot;Middle East&quot;.
In fact, since its establishment on 15 May 1948 until today, &quot;Israel&quot;
remains a State without a constitution, partially because it refuses to
specify its international borders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An updated version of the Nile-to-Euphrates &quot;Israel&quot;
was voiced by Shimon Peres, a former Prime Minister, in which &quot;Israel&quot;
gives up literal physical control in exchange for becoming the economic
and political superpower of the region.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Either way, those who write the definitions and establish
the reference points nowadays don't seem to find any problems with a borderless
&quot;Israel&quot;, but the quotation marks protect us from that version
of &quot;peace&quot;, in what everybody now calls erroneously the &quot;Middle
East&quot;!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for peace in the Middle East, yes, we do support the
idea that brother should not kill brother, and that all should turn to building
prosperity and love each other IN AFGHANISTAN!! </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Let's Take Back Our &quot;Nothing&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ray Hanania*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Peace&quot; does have a problem. It is the most unappreciated
aspect of the Middle East.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just listen to the profound remarks of Israel's shortsighted,
unimaginative Prime Minister, Benyamin Netanyahu, whose &quot;hero&quot;
is Menachem Begin, the terrorist who founded the Likud Party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Said Netanyahu recently: &quot;Oslo gave us nothing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Okay, Bibi. Then give us our &quot;Nothing&quot; back,
and we'll give you back what you have given us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's idea of &quot;Peace&quot; with the Palestinians,
obviously, is &quot;No Peace at all.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Is Netanyahu on drugs or something? Is the depravity and
the insanity of the Likud Party really that serious? I just thought they
were fanatics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Maybe Netanyahu just feels unappreciated. Reading history,
he might wish to have been among the early American settlers who traded
multi-coloured but worthless beads to the Indians in exchange for ownership
of Manhattan Island.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Maybe Netanyahu is right. What he is saying is what the
extremists on both sides have been saying for nearly five years now--that
Oslo is nothing and there is no peace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rather than disappoint Netanyahu, the Palestinians &quot;and&quot;
the Arabs should take back our &quot;nothing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And maybe for all our efforts to try to compromise, Oslo
has given us &quot;nothing.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I look at the 1% of land we have, and think, he's right.
It is nothing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I want all of pre-Mandated Palestine returned to us, the
Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why should I trade away what is already mine?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite Oslo, the Palestinians are still discriminated
against and Israel is still racist. Just look at Upper Nazareth. During
World War II, we might have called it a part of the Third Reich, treating
Jews one way and Christians and Muslims another. The Jewish community of
Upper Nazareth continues to receive vast amounts of support. The Arabs of
original Nazareth (called Lower Nazareth by the racist Zionists there) receive
little to nothing. And they are supposed to be &quot;Israeli&quot; citizens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And let's stop &quot;recognizing&quot; Israel. It's the
&quot;Zionist Entity.&quot; And, furthermore, I want all of the land back,
right up to the Mediterranean Sea, land that belongs to the Palestinians,
and not the immigrants who streamed in illegally from Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the current peace is nothing, Netanyahu might rather
have the old days that, to him, were something, alright.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While we Arabs would lose wars with Israel, we were winning
the political front. Re-install the oil embargoes and the economic boycott
of Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries expel Israel's
representatives, since we no longer recognize Israel and instead refer to
it as it should be in Netanyahu's World of Peace as the &quot;Zionist Entity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No contact. No recognition. No economic trading with countries
that support Israel. No passports. No travel with the &quot;Zionist Entity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And Israel can go back to living in constant fear of war
and real acts of terrorism, that in the last 10 years have vanished not
only from reality but from our Arab efforts to recover what has been stolen
from us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We could all follow Netanyahu's unimaginative, uninspired,
un-visionary and anti-peace stand, and we can turn back the clock 50 years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We could continue to lose more battles, too, if that is
what Netanyahu and his cabinet of Rasputins would desire. We Arabs know
that while we lost many military battles with Israel, we only have to win
one to succeed and achieve our goal of the rebirth of Palestine as a nation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We can start dusting off the old rhetoric that all this
time I thought Israelis had wanted to abandon and replace with something
more positive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We can start demanding that the Arab World again rebuild
its war machines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And win or lose, we would rather spend our energies trying
to achieve justice than surrendering to an international criminal like Netanyahu,
all for &quot;nothing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We could turn away from the peace process with Israel,
since it has brought as much &quot;nothing&quot; for us as it has, apparently,
for Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But, I don't know if I want to take the word of a fool
like Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It makes me wonder, though.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Are the Israelis just that stupid, or don't they know that
they have an idiot for a Prime Minister?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Students from some Arab and Muslim countries
face repressive measures</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ghada Khouri*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Students from Arab countries viewed with suspicion by the
U.S. State Department may be prevented from pursuing a higher education
in scientific fields in the United States. During a recent Senate hearing,
Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) supported the adoption of measures that would
bar students from States designated as sponsors of terrorism from pursuing
science majors and would expand the role of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) in monitoring their activities in the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I have grave reservations regarding the practice
of issuing visas to terrorist-supporting countries and the inability of
the INS to track those who come into the country either using a student
visa or using fraudulent documents,&quot; Feinstein told the Senate Subcommittee
on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information on 24 February during
a hearing on &quot;Foreign Terrorists in America: Five Years After the World
Trade Center Bombing.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Efforts to curb the admission of Arab students into American
colleges and universities are influenced by a report issued last September
by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), a conservative
think tank. The report, entitled &quot;Open Admissions: U.S. Policy Toward
Students from Terrorism-Supporting Countries in the Middle East,&quot; advocates
restrictions on students from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Syria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report, written by Hillary Mann, recommends that the
U.S. government take steps to:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Require in-depth background checks on students coming
from States designated as sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of
State and deny entry to those students wishing to study subjects that could
contribute to their countries' nuclear, biological or chemical weapons programmes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Prohibit governments designated as sponsors of terrorism
from financing their students' higher education in the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Expand an INS pilot programme designed to monitor foreign
students in the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>* Coordinate efforts with other countries that attract
students from States designated as sponsors of terrorism to impede their
access to weapons-related technology. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An existing law, Title 8 of the U.S. Code, already gives
the U.S. government the legal authority to deny visas to prospective students
who may be involved in terrorist activities or who may seek to illegally
acquire nonconventional weapons technology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Mann cites government data indicating that nearly
10,000 student visas were issued to students from &quot;terrorist&quot;
States between 1991 and 1996. She adds that only &quot;a very small number&quot;
of visa applications were denied based on concerns about terrorism or technology
transfer and that a &quot;significant percentage&quot; of those initially
denied subsequently obtained a visa on appeal. She implies that the mere
fact that denials were low indicates a loophole in the law. Her argument
ignores the possibility that the small number of denials actually reflects
the fact that the overwhelming majority of Arab students pursuing scientific
studies are driven by ethical purposes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The report attempts to show that because large numbers
of students from five particular Middle Eastern countries are studying science
and engineering, they should be monitored as potential terrorists,&quot;
said Gary Althen, President of the National Association of Foreign Student
Advisers. &quot;The fact is that most foreign students in the United States,
especially those from Third World countries, study science and engineering.
These areas of expertise are what developing countries need the most to
raise standards of living and to enter the highly competitive global economy.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite these criticisms, the WINEP report is gaining interest
in Congress. One of its most alarming recommendations is the expansion of
an existing INS monitoring system of foreign student activities in the United
States. The programme was adopted in response to a memorandum issued after
the 1993 World Trade Center bombing by FBI Director Louis Freeh, in which
he outlined loopholes in the U.S. visa system. The INS pilot programme,
which was implemented in June 1997, makes it mandatory for colleges and
universities to provide information on foreign students, including their
address, academic status and any disciplinary action taken against them
by the institution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Critics say the debate on restricting foreign student access
to U.S. universities is shaped by anti-Arab sentiments and broad generalizations
about the implications of allowing students from some Arab countries to
pursue their education in American institutions. Renowned Arab-basher Steven
Emerson, who describes himself as a journalist and &quot;terrorism expert,&quot;
added fuel to the fire in his testimony before the Senate hearing on &quot;Foreign
Terrorists in America&quot; by making inflammatory remarks about Muslim
organizations in the United States.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Several weeks before the hearing, Arab-American and Muslim
organizations contacted the Subcommittee to express concerns about the nature
of the hearing. They were assured that only federal law enforcement officials
from the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department would testify.
However, one day before the hearing, Emerson's name was added to the list
of witnesses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Emerson's impartiality has been put in question by many
sources. The Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, reported that Emerson
had close ties with Israeli intelligence and The New York Times described
his 1991 book &quot;Terrorist&quot; as &quot;marred by factual errors...
that betray an unfamiliarity with the Middle East and by a pervasive anti-Arab
and anti-Palestinian bias.&quot; Emerson appeared on several media outlets
as a &quot;terrorism expert&quot; after the Oklahoma City bombing and the
crash of TWA Flight 800. In both instances, he blamed Arabs and Muslims
for the tragedies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The WINEP report, the recent Senate hearing and the continuing
vitriolic rhetoric espoused by individuals like Emerson are indicative of
an alarming trend to treat some students as potential terrorists. Its effects
are already being felt through a new policy prohibiting students from Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea from taking the Test of English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL), which is required for admission to U.S. universities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In response to complaints from educators and educational
associations, representatives of the Educational Testing Service (ETS),
which administers the TOEFL exam, said their policy was based on &quot;advice
from outside counsel, in consultation with the [U.S.] Treasury Department.&quot;
They cited a 1995 Executive Order that primarily prohibits financial and
business transactions with Iran, but makes no mention of students. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a letter to ETS, the Middle East Studies Association
(MESA), which comprises 2,600 academics worldwide who teach and conduct
research on the Middle East, described the ETS policy as a &quot;discriminatory
denial of academic freedom,&quot; pointing out that &quot;educational institutions
should stand above the political fray and changing political considerations.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The growing support for measures targeting some Arab and
Muslim students is part of a larger trend toward repressive legislation
in the name of fighting terrorism. Critics warn that such measures will
inevitably lead to an erosion of civil liberties. In a country that prides
itself on the free flow of information, preventing students from some countries
from pursuing scientific studies essentially pronounces them guilty by association.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Science is science,&quot; Larry Johnson, former deputy
director of the State Department's Counterterrorism Office told the U.S.
News and World Report. &quot;You can use it for either good or evil. The
courses someone would pursue for becoming a doctor, a world-renowned biochemist,
or a biological terrorist are the same. If we look at all pre-med students
as potential terrorists, I think we've gone to the ultimate extreme of insanity.&quot;

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Great Short American Temper: From Waco
to Baghdad</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Muna Salman* </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Why did the US, in contrast to the world body, seem so
trigger-happy in its reaction to Iraq's violations of UN weapon inspection
procedures? What thought process led US decision makers to corner themselves
in a zero-sum negotiating position over a purely diplomatic issue? So out
of proportion was the US reaction to the Iraqi infraction the Clinton administration
soon found itself isolated against a world opinion perplexed by and opposed
to the threat of military force. Why did the US act more threatened than
Kuwait or Iran both countries who suffered immensely at the hands of Saddam.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A quick analysis of US gun diplomacy supports the theory
of an American political culture which views the process of violent law
enforcement as a suitable punishment in itself and a substitute to due process.
The same culture seems to also favor the use of lethal, indiscriminate,
and disproportionate fire power versus the more civil but admittedly challenging
use of diplomacy, negotiations, and dialogue. This culture of brutal enforcement
seams to permeates all levels of the executive machine: international, federal,
and local. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Zero to 80 Deaths in 51 Days</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The mission: to serve arrest and search warrants. The place:
Waco, Texas, at the Branch Davidian compound. The date: February 1993. By
April 1993 the situation has escalated to where the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms had raided the Branch Davidian compound with a ferocity resembling
that of commando operations against enemy targets. The assault left cult
leader David Koresh and 80 of his followers burned to death including 25
children. The investigations following the bloody &quot;fiasco&quot; demonstrated
how both the BATF and FBI used unnecessary force and pursued a calculated
method of deliberate escalation which resulted in the civilian mayhem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Again, in the much publicized case of Ruby Ridge, Idaho,
informants from the BATF entrapped Randy Weaver into breaking the law. The
BATF proceeded to falsify reports and obtained an indictment against Weaver.
During the confrontation which followed, FBI snipers were given rules of
engagement stating &quot;any armed male adult observed in the vicinity of
the Weaver cabin could and should be killed.&quot; An hour after taking
their positions, and without warning or demanding surrender, the FBI killed
or seriously wounded every adult in the Weavers cabin. Randy Weaver was
shot in the back by an FBI sniper who then killed Randy's wife as she stood
at the cabin door holding her ten-month-old baby. In 1995, a federal jury
awarded the Weaver family $3.1 million for wrongful death and found them
innocent of almost all charges. Another example of deliberate lethal escalation.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1985, Philadelphia police responded to complaints of
a foul smell and loud noises emanating from the residence of a back-to-nature
group named MOVE. When MOVE members refused to comply with police orders,
they were soon under siege. In the frenzy which followed, flames engulfed
the house after an explosive &quot;entry device&quot; was used by the police
resulting in the burning deaths of 11 residents 5 of whom were children.
Eleven years later, the court awarded some of the survivors $1.5 million
after establishing that the city of Philadelphia has violated their constitutional
rights in using unreasonable and deadly force. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While those are much publicized cases, incidents of overzealous
law enforcement are abound. Evening news reports are littered with police
brutality incidents leading to the deaths of innocent or non-violent suspects.
Not to mention the ceaseless police hot pursuits resulting in the destruction
of life and property of traffic violators and innocent bystanders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Again and again the process of pursuit and apprehension
assumes an importance of its own and the basic human rights of citizens
involved or nearby are suspended no matter how non-violent the alleged trespasses
are. </FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>American Collateral Damage</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These cases are by no means exceptions to the rule nor
are they isolated incidents. When combined, a pattern evolves which clearly
demonstrates a propensity by US law enforcement machines to resort reflexively
to a system of escalated violence even at the cost of innocent lives. Again
and again, relatively minor offenses or procedural violations are used as
launching ground for a series of escalations leading to the unnecessary
exercise of deadly force. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From crossing a red-light, a hot pursuit, to death from
a car crash. From disgruntled neighbors to the burning deaths of 11 innocent
people in Philadelphia. From evading apprehension to FBI sniper fire obliterating
a family in Ruby Ridge. From refusal to comply with search and arrest warrants
to the burning death of 25 children amongst 55 adults in Waco. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This short-tempered law enforcement culture will not stop
at the US borders. As the US takes upon itself the role of world police,
the philosophy of the process-is-the-end and the resulting violent enforcement
seems to permeate US actions at the international arena. The recent Iraqi
violations of UNSCOM's procedures and the US threat to use deadly force
to resolve what seems to the rest of the world as a procedural dispute is
a matter of concern. To equate the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to Iraq's disputes
with UNSCOM in severity is senseless. To call for the use of overwhelming
firepower to bomb Iraq into acquiescence is wrong in light of the potential
for such tremendous loss of innocent human lives as projected by military
experts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But unlike Waco and MOVE victims, Iraqis cannot seek legal
redress accorded to US citizens. The mere mention of foreigners in foreign
lands prompts most Americans to grow moral blinders instantaneously. Even
a basic premise such as punishment following crime is disregarded as many
Americans find themselves calling for lethal punitive measures in response
to an Iraqi crime that was not committed yet. There is not a court of law
in the US or the civilized world which would entertain such logic or its
absence. To the contrary and as demonstrated by Waco, Ruby Ridge, and MOVE,
the courts are inclined to punish the government for such needless escalation
of violence and the tragic loss of human lives. But all what America stands
for seems to stop at the borders. How bizarre and how ironic. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Information Wars</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Fazeel Aziz Chauhan*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Leaders, celebrities and experts are glamourized and marketed
to us by TV and other media messengers as proved true by the popular movie
&quot;Wag The Dog&quot;. These days, the truth is hard to find and lies
leave you blind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With scientific progress in cloning, cosmetic surgery and
video manipulation, it's becoming hard to identify what is real and what
is not. And it's becoming so easy to lie to people. We need to take responsibility
and make an effort to seek the truth and not believe the lies. Our personal
motto, as suggested by KPFK's bumper sticker, should be: I will not mindlessly
conform and be herded like a sheep! KPFK is a listener-sponsored radio station
at 90.7 FM, which has absolutely no advertising. They are a rare voice of
truth in Los Angeles, California, with affiliates in Berkeley, California,
and Washington, D.C. The weekly &quot;Nation&quot; is also an excellent
source.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking the truth is usually the domain of honourable
intellectuals, artists and musicians. One of rock music's greatest albums,
&quot;The Wall&quot; by Pink Floyd, was re-recorded 20 years later in Berlin.
Roger Waters, former leader of the band, performed with scores of world-renowned
musicians at the radiant occasion of the fall of the Berlin Wall. All over
the world, people tuned into their TV's and witnessed the masses of Europeans
on the streets, tearing down the Wall between East and West Germany. People's
hearts were moved at this profound sight of unity, and they hoped for a
new era, and for a world full of peace, love and harmony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For decades, the U.S. had claimed the Soviet Union and
the Communists as the enemy. We staged wars in small countries around the
world to fight against them and to profit from the weapon sales. But the
common American still has no idea about what Communism is, or even where
the 50 United States are, let alone knowing who the Russians are or which
continent they live on. Historically, political leaders and the media messengers
have frequently preyed upon the fears and ignorance of people. Reagan dehumanized
and demonized the human beings of the Soviet Union by calling them &quot;The
Evil Empire&quot;. But a few years later, he made peace with his &quot;Devils&quot;
and they were now sold to us as our friends, no longer our enemies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As the Cold War ended, people around the world were full
of hope that maybe human beings had finally made enough spiritual progress
to be able to sanely and peacefully live and let live. During the Cold War,
one fourth of our budget was being spent on the department of Defense. Now
Americans felt we had defeated our greatest enemy and had become the undisputed
number one superpower of the world. In the last few years, what slowly brewed
and emerged as the new enemy was &quot;Islamic Fundamentalism&quot;, threatening
the national security of America. We should not accept such insanity and
should speak out as Faiz Ahmed Faiz suggests:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bowl Kay Lab Aazaad Hai-n Tayray (Speak As Your Lips Are
Free).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When you catch someone who is committing an immoral act,
often his or her reaction is to immediately and completely deny any wrongdoing.
They may even suggest that you are paranoid or insane, but don't let that
stop you:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speak the Truth to Concrete</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speak the Truth and Be Free</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speak the Truth to the Powers That Be</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To be an activist or to be successful in any of life's
endeavours, it is important to be patient and persistent. In particular,
don't let anyone break your spirit, steal your dreams, or make you quit.
One of my favorite lines in the movie &quot;Amistad&quot; is &quot;Raise
your head high and walk upright&quot;. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Usually, journalists get their news from government releases
and hardly question the accuracy of the &quot;facts&quot;. The media becomes
a brainwashing machine of misinformation and keeps the masses ignorant.
Our government empowered and sold weapons to Iraq in the war against Iran.
Saddam Hussein was our friend, but became our enemy when he got greedy enough
to want the oil in Kuwait. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia's ruling monarchs hired
several countries, including the U.S., for money, to go to war against Iraq.
During the Gulf War, the military censored what American TV could put on
the air. People were glued to their TV's every night and they were entertained
by the horror films of human beings being murdered. The ratings and profits
went sky-high. Iraq was decimated during the war, so why does our President
want to go over there again and beat up a country that does not have the
strength to stand up? Is it the same scenario as casually suggested by the
movie &quot;Wag The Dog&quot;, in which a false war is &quot;Produced&quot;,
Hollywood movie-style, to distract the media from focusing on the President's
alleged affair with a teenager?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To tell the truth is not the mission of TV and other media
messengers. Instead, it is about entertainment and making profits. Whatever
sells is what's put on TV, producing couch potatoes and vidiots. Big corporations
control the content of TV programmes through their selective sponsorships.
And Big Business controls elected officials by pouring millions of dollars
into their campaign funds. TV is targeted because most Americans use TV
to get their information. TV is viewed as the gospel spoken by a prophet.
&quot;If it's on TV, it must be true&quot;. So the viewers absorb the messages
on TV like a sponge, without doing any filtering or critical analysis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of these days, Muslim parents will get hip and encourage
their children to seek careers in TV and other media. Can you imagine the
type of programming a station could broadcast if the news director was Muslim?
African-Americans, Pacific Asians and Hispanics are exercising their power
through politics, business and the media. Muslims should learn to play the
same game. The least we can do is write letters to the editors and to our
elected officials to let our voices be heard. Together, we can change the
situation. In childhood, they taught us: &quot;Knowledge is power&quot;.
Today, whoever is powerful gets the most coverage in the media, making it
a world where &quot;Power is Knowledge&quot;. That's not good news for those
who are not so powerful. As the beloved musician Jackson Browne states,
through the lies on TV and other media, we are headed for the &quot;Information
Wars&quot;.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>50 Years of Continued Suffering</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As we are approaching the 50th anniversary of the usurpation
of Palestine, about 3.5 million Palestine refugees continue to live under
difficult conditions while waiting for a just solution to their problem.
The following UNRWA feature highlights the suffering of the refugees through
the story of Abu Ghaben family in Beach camp in Gaza Strip.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Just ordinary people</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Beach camp is the third largest camp for Palestine refugees
in the Gaza Strip, with a population of some 66,000 in 1997. Situated along
the Mediterranean coast northeast of Gaza City, the camp, with its densely
packed cement block shelters, covers an area of 747 dunums (74.7 hectares)
and has one of the highest population densities in the world - about 85,000
people per square kilometre. It was established after the 1948 war to house
some 23,000 refugees from Lod, Jaffa, Beersheba and the southern coastal
plain. The camp has 17 UNRWA schools, a health centre, a women's programme
centre, a distribution centre, camp relief and social services office and
a sanitation office. Residents also use UNRWA's Rimal health centre in the
town. In 1997 UNRWA rehabilitated several hundred shelters in the camp,
but the waiting list is still long with at least 300 shelters in need of
urgent repair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sloping down towards the sea, Beach camp is criss-crossed
by hundreds of narrow sand-clogged alleys. For years, untreated sewage flowed
freely down them and the perennial problem of flooding led to the sand being
infected with parasites. Children have nowhere to play except in the sand
and many of them were infected by the age of four with Ascaris (round worm).
UNRWA has now tackled the problem by installing a new sewerage system with
contributions from donor governments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jamal Abu Ghaben and his mother Um Jamal (&quot;mother
of Jamal&quot; and grandmother of Bustan and Mohammad) welcomed UNRWA information
staff into their shelter in the hope that taking their story to the donors'
meeting would help increase support for all the other Palestine refugee
families and for UNRWA's programmes in the camps. This is their story:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Um Jamal recounts the 1948 &quot;disaster&quot;, as she
calls it. Her parents fled Hirbiyeh, near Majdal (Ashqelon area) and she
was born five weeks later on the way south. When she was only two her parents
died and her eldest brother, then only 13, and her six year-old sister looked
after the other children. &quot;I don't remember my parents; I don't even
know what they looked like. We have no photos of them.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The family spent the first six years in tents in the Tuffah
neighbourhood of old Gaza and then moved to Jabalia after UNRWA started
building a camp there. In 1984 Um Jamal, her husband and children moved
to Beach camp to be near her sister. In 1997, Um Jamal and Abu Jamal, their
sons, unmarried daughters, daughters-in-law and grandchildren all lived
in the shelter - 18 people in all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Twenty-seven year-old Jamal, the oldest son and father
of Bustan and Mohammad, also lives in the shelter with his wife and third
child. Jamal suffers from poor eyesight and broken teeth as a result of
four years in Israeli prisons in the late 1980s. He is a prolific writer
and has recorded in a diary all his thoughts since those days. In prison
he also embroidered, &quot;There is no home like the homeland, my son&quot;
and framed it with two of his prison photos. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the day he was released, during the intifada in 1990,
a curfew had been imposed. As he tried to find his way home he was shot
in the neck for breaking the curfew and had to wait 14 hours before being
taken to hospital. UNRWA later sent him to St John's Ophthalmic Hospital
in East Jerusalem for eye treatment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite four years of prison and four years of unemployment
afterwards, Jamal still had the energy and ambition to start his own small
business. In the beginning, he displayed his goods on the ground in the
camp market. Then in 1996, with a small business loan of $1,000 from UNRWA's
micro-enterprise programme in Gaza, he was able to rent a small shop in
the market where he mainly sells children's clothes, cosmetics and accessories.
Business was going well, especially on Fridays when the market is usually
packed. Jamal paid off the first loan and then a second one of $2,000. In
1997 he took a third loan of $4,000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then Jamal's business, like many others, began to suffer
under the impact of Israeli-imposed closures on Gaza and tougher restrictions
on Palestinian labourers entering Israel for work. Products he had ordered
and paid for in advance from the West Bank could not be delivered into Gaza
and prices began to rise. Soon he could not make the monthly repayments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is Um Jamal's determination that keeps the family going.
What does she think of the younger generation? &quot;There was greater poverty
when I was a child, but my life was still easier than Jamal's generation.
They have had the hardest time. They experienced the intifada and prison.
Also, they are educated. They know their rights and they have a sense of
themselves. They won't compromise.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Talal, one of Jamal's younger brothers, wants to get married
but there is no room in the overcrowded shelter. Another brother, Kamal,
also lives there with his wife and five children. There is also the youngest
brother, Noor, who is still at school, and three sisters, 20 year-old Samah,
16 year-old Sabreen and nine year-old Leina. Those members of the family
who work are trying to raise enough money to build another room in the shelter,
which will cost between $3,500 and $7,000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The cement block shelter, built in the 1960s as temporary
housing, is old and needs constant repair. Rainwater comes in through holes
in the kitchen roof. Water from the bathroom seeps through to the adjoining
kitchen floor, so this too needs to be repaired. Abu Jamal's main concern,
though, is the lack of space for a growing family.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another major worry is the rising cost of living. Food
has become more expensive. Fifty kilos of flour costs $20 and it goes too
quickly with so many mouths to feed. It is hard to keep up the electricity
and water payments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Um Jamal works with 13 other women and girls in a sewing
group she administers. They are part of the Creative Women group whose members
number about 60 in different camps in the Gaza Strip. She is skilled in
traditional Palestinian embroidery and teaches younger women. With a small
loan of $280 from the Save the Children Federation in Gaza, she bought thread
and fabrics. Now she produces traditional dresses, tablecloths, scarves,
cushion covers and other items that the group sells. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Economic problems, social and family problems, overcrowding.
Everyone is becoming more and more stressed. Jamal borrowed his parents'
savings to pay the monthly repayment on the UNRWA small business loan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now there is no money to build another room or partition.
&quot;This is </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>breaking us,&quot; Um Jamal says. Jamal's father tells
him that he and his family have two months to leave the shelter to make
room for the younger brother, who wants to get married. In the meantime,
Jamal and his family stay in their room but the door into the common area
is locked and a new door into the alley is opened up. To reach the shared
kitchen and bathroom now means a trek down the narrow alleyway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Frustrated and locked in his own thoughts, Jamal starts
to write. His hopes for the future are for a shelter for his family and
stable employment. &quot;But our problem, more than at any other time, is
political not economic,&quot; he writes. &quot;I need to breathe first and
then eat. The political situation is ignoring the refugees. If we don't
fight for ourselves, then who will?&quot; The electricity goes off. Again.
It could be off for hours. He continues to write by the light of a paraffin
lamp...</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusions</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the short time, Israel will continue to have the political
and military upper-hand in the region. Its army has the most troops and
the highest level of training. The air force is probably the most advanced
and well-trained in the world. It has a successful nuclear programme and
possesses the capability one or more enemy population centres in a matter
of minutes. It takes in over a billion dollars a year in military aid from
the United States. And, its military intelligence team has penetrated every
enemy nation and could probably provide advance warning of any planned attack.
Finally, Israel has the psychological military advantage of ultimately having
nothing to lose if it looked like it was really going to be destroyed. This
makes potential attackers afraid of what Israel might be willing to do if
pushed to the brink. All this is a potent combination-- so potent that it
is hard for us to imagine any major change in this reality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli right-wingers believe that this short-term reality
is one that can be sustained into the long-term future. They are resigned
to the idea that the Arab majority will never accept their existence, and
therefore the only option for long-term survival is to maintain military
superiority ad infinitum. This political assessment leads them to think
that the Israeli left's call for an end to the occupation and a Palestinian
state is based entirely on moral belief.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, many on the right will even concede that the left's
vision is the moral one in the debate. But they will tell you that this
moral position is incompatible with the political and military requirements
for survival.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a supporter of the Israeli left, I must admit that I
am primarily drawn to the left-wing vision because of its morality. My strong
belief is that a state based on Jewish identity should also be based on
some fundamental Jewish principles: chief of which is that it is unholy
to oppress another people. But I am not writing this essay to argue the
morality of the left's vision. I am writing to point out that Israel will
not be able to survive another fifty years if it does not move to the left.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The bitter pill for Jews is accepting that Israel will
ultimately have to depend on its neighbours' willingness to allow it to
exist. When one looks at the long term factors discussed above (our previous
issue), it becomes clear that it is Israel, not the Palestinians or other
Arab nations, who actually has the least sustainable political and military
position in the Middle East.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, the idea of being politically dependent on anybody,
much less the Arabs, is something most Israelis can't stand. Molded by the
devastation of the Holocaust and nineteen centuries of exile, persecution
and catastrophe, Israel's core identity is founded upon the idea that Jews
cannot count on surviving as long as they have to depend on the acceptance
or good-will of any other nation. The existence of Israel represents, to
most Jews, finally being done with that precarious role in history. What
will be difficult for most Israelis, and Jewish supporters, to accept is
that, while it may be true that Jews are at risk without an independent
state, they are also at risk even with a state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In order to safeguard their long term survival, Israel
and the Jewish people need to start by coming to term with the fact that
there is no such thing as a total security for small peoples in this world.
Nothing can purchase that kind of invulnerability: not a long-term strategy
of maintaining military superiority, not even atomic bombs and the willingness
to use them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After accepting that they will eventually have to depend
on their neighbours to exist, the next thing Israelis need to do is pursue
a political path that will prevent the dependency from being a one-way street.
They need to create long-term relationships with their neighbours that will
also make their neighbors dependent upon them for their own success and
well-being. If Israel can manage to form long-term, sturdy, interdependent
economic, cultural, medical, industrial, infrastructural, and possibly military
ties with its Arab neighbours, then Israel's ongoing existence will be in
its neighbours' interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This kind of security vision is what Shimon Peres has promoted
for years, and it is usually scoffed at as idealistic and highly risky.
But this vision is a blueprint of the necessary political conditions for
Israel to be a viable state over the next fifty years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What is so distressing about the Netanyahu government's
course of action is that it is squandering the best opportunity Israel has
ever had to start constructing this kind of regional interdependence. The
end of the Cold War thrust all of Israel's neighbouring states into the
position of having to search for new ways to re-formulate their own separate
political stabilities. A climate emerged in which second and third-world
heads of state all over the world, including the Middle East, had to look
for new stable relationships with other powers. This sudden period of political
fluidity presented many Arab leaders with the opportunity to bolt from the
Arab League's previous long-term refusal of any acceptance of Israel. Israel
needed to make a move first, however, in order to make such a shift possible
for the Arabs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shimon Peres was able to convince Yitzhak Rabin that Israel's
long-term security lay in creating a new Middle East-- one that was extremely
interdependence. Since Israel was in the fortunate position of being able
to offer lots of economic and technological goodies to Arab countries, it
stood a chance to interest Arab leaders in beginning to form interdependent
ties. That is why Rabin rescued the career of his mortal enemy, Yasser Arafat,
from the brink of total collapse by extending his hand to him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He saw that it was necessary. He also saw that other steps
would be necessary on Israel's part-- letting go of the West Bank and Gaza,
letting the Palestinian's establish a state, and even making compromises
on the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rabin, whose entire military and political career was based
upon safeguarding Israel's security, came to accept his intra-party rival,
Peres's, vision of interdependence slowly. But once he saw the realpolitik
truth of it-- that this was Israel's only real chance of a permanent place
in the region-- he abandoned outdated security strategies and pursued better
ones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And he received, in return, many early indications that
the strategy was working. Arab leaders began making secret, and then public,
overtures to Israel. The Arab boycott was eased, then dropped, allowing
billions of dollars to enter Israel's economy. Jordan offered a cease-fire,
and then made peace. Rabin made unprecedented official state visit to the
King of Morocco and the Sultan of Oman. Even Saudi officials shook hands
in public with Rabin and Peres on the White House lawn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel was also able to begin the work of integrating its
economy and infrastructure with its neighbours-- the next phase of the interdependence
survival strategy. Israeli-Jordanian and Israeli-Palestinian teams began
trade talks, water and electrical system talks, agricultural talks, and
military joint-exercises. Regional tourism opened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is all this hard work that Netanyahu and his government
are undoing. In the name of their vision of long-term security based on
uncompromising nationalist land claims and the fallacy of &quot;permanent
military superiority&quot;, they are ironically destroying what might be
Israel's only chance of real longevity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The scariest part is that, as the new post-Cold War order
of political relationships and structures solidifies into the next major
global political era, Israel may be cementing its place in that order as
an isolated military power with no chance at normal relations with its own
region. Without a major market to entice the American corporate oligarchy,
without significant natural resources, and without a Cold War, Israel may
position itself into being an expensive and annoying burden to the U.S.,
costing America a lot of money to keep it viable, and causing American business
to lose out to other wealthy industrial nations in the next century's battle
for huge third-world markets in Africa and the Middle East. (Enter America's
far right wing politicians at this point, railing against Jewish interests
ruining life for middle-America.) Couple that with an American Jewish population
that is shrinking due to assimilation, and that is losing its ability to
identify with an Israel that is allowing the ultra-Orthodox to dominate,
and you see how probable it is that there will not be enough pro-Israel
political support in the U.S. to outweigh the liability Israel will become
to the corporate, ruling interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is the path Bibi &amp; Co. are charting for Israel.
If they succeed, don't count on there being an Israel for your grandchildren
to visit. Instead, prepare to explain to them how Israel came apart at the
seams around the year 2030. You night say to them that a brave, visionary
man named Yitzhak Rabin tried to protect his country's future, but was assassinated
by one of his own people. Tell them that shortly after he died, Israeli
support for his vision grew to record levels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But then, you will say, fundamentalist Muslims in Gaza
and the West Bank, encouraged by backers in Iran, saw what was happening.
Seeing that their wish for a strict Islamic state in all of 'Israel' and
Palestine would never materialize of Israel became integrated into the region,
they deliberately set out to get Israelis to abandon their new, integrationist
strategy. They needed Israel to return to its previous uncompromising strategy
of being the neighbourhood bully, so they could win back the support of
the entire Arab world. They needed Jews the world over to get stuck in the
short-sighted trap of their own psychology of fear and mistrust. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You can finish the story by telling the grand kids that
a couple of bus bombings later, Benyamin Netanyahu rose to power, and in
a couple years' time demolished his own country's best chance at long-term
stability more thoroughly and effectively than Hamas ever could have on
its own. As they look up at you, you can close with, &quot;And that's how
come we don't have an Israel anymore, honey.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>History will record this, if we let it. But, Jewish tradition
teaches us that we are not helpless to the momentum of history. Indeed,
our 3,500 year survival represents what could be the longest human odyssey
against historical odds. Now is the time for all of us who care about Israel's
future, and about the future of a just peace, to see that these are intertwined.
Now is the time for the pro-Israel peace-camp to get busy.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Part 3</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Prejudice and Prevarication</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The first difficulty in writing about this subject is that
the term 'Jew' has been used during the last 150 years with two rather different
meanings. To understand this, let us imagine ourselves in the year 1780.
Then the universally accepted meaning of the term 'Jew' basically coincided
with what the Jews themselves understood as constituting their own identity.
This identity was primarily religious, but the precepts of religion governed
the details of daily behaviour in all aspects of life, both social and private,
among the Jews themselves as well as in their relation to non-Jews. It was
then literally true that a Jew could not even drink a glass of water in
the home of a non-Jew. And the same basic laws of behaviour towards non-Jews
were equally valid from Yemen to New York. Whatever the term by which the
Jews of 1780 may he described - and I do not wish to enter into a metaphysical
dispute about terms like, 'nation' and 'people' - it is clear that all Jewish
communities at that time were separate from the non-Jewish societies in
the midst of which they were living.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, all this was changed by two parallel processes
beginning in Holland and England, continuing in revolutionary France and
in countries which followed the example of the French Revolution and then
in the modern monarchies of the 19th century: the Jews gained a significant
level of individual rights (in some cases full legal equality), and the
legal power of the Jewish community over its members was destroyed. It should
be noted that both developments were simultaneous, and that the latter is
even more important, albeit less widely known, than the former.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the time of the late Roman Empire, Jewish communities
had considerable legal powers over their members. Not only powers which
arise through voluntary mobilisation of social pressure (for example refusal
to have any dealing whatsoever with an excommunicated Jew or even to bury
his body), but a power of naked coercion: to flog, to imprison, to expel
- all this could be inflicted quite legally on an individual Jew by the
rabbinical courts for all kinds of offences. In many countries- Spain and
Poland are notable examples - even capital punishment could be and was inflicted,
sometimes using particularly cruel methods such as flogging to death. All
this was not only permitted but positively encouraged by the state authorities
in both Christian and Muslim countries, who besides their general interest
in preserving 'law and order' had in some cases a more direct financial
interest as well. For example, in Spanish archives dating from the 13th
and 14th centuries there are records of many detailed orders issued by those
most devout Catholic Kings of Castile and Aragon, instructing their no less
devout officials to co-operate with the rabbis in enforcing observance of
the Sabbath by the Jews. Why? Because whenever a Jew was fined by a rabbinical
court for violating the Sabbath, the rabbis had to hand nine tenths of the
fine over to the king - a very profitable and effective arrangement. Similarly,
one can quote from the responsa written shortly before 1832 by the famous
Rabbi Moshe Sofer of Pressburg (now Bratislava), in what was then the autonomous
Hungarian Kingdom in the Austrian Empire, and addressed to Vienna in Austria
proper, where the Jews had already been granted some considerable individual
rights. He laments the fact that since the Jewish congregation in Vienna
lost its powers to punish offenders, the Jews there have become lax in matters
of religious observance, and adds: 'Here in Pressburg when I am told that
a Jewish shopkeeper dared to open his shop during the Lesser Holidays, I
immediately send a policeman to imprison him.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This was the most important social fact of Jewish existence
before the advent of the modern state: observance of the religious laws
of Judaism, as well as their inculcation through education, were enforced
on Jews by physical coercion, from which one could only escape by conversion
to the religion of the majority, amounting in the circumstances to a total
social break and for that reason very impracticable, except during a religious
crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, once the modern state had come into existence,
the Jewish community lost its powers to punish or intimidate the individual
Jew. The bonds of one of the most closed of 'closed societies', one of the
most totalitarian societies in the whole history of mankind were snapped.
This act of liberation came mostly from outside; although there were some
Jews who helped it from within, these were at first very few. This form
of liberation had very grave consequences for the future. Just as in the
case of Germany (according to the masterly analysis of A.J. P. Taylor) it
was easy to ally the cause of reaction with patriotism, because in actual
fact individual rights and equality before the law were brought into Germany
by the armies of the French Revolution and of Napoleon, and one could brand
liberty as 'un-German', exactly so it turned out to be very easy among the
Jews, particularly in Israel, to amount a very effective attack against
all the notions and ideals of humanism and the rule of law (not to say democracy)
as something 'un-Jewish' or 'anti-Jewish' - as indeed they are, in a historical
sense - and as principles which may be used in the 'Jewish interest', but
which have no validity against the 'Jewish interest', for example when Arabs
invoke these same principles. This has also led - again just as in Germany
and other nations of Mitteleuropa - to a deceitful, sentimental and ultra-romantic
Jewish historiography, from which all inconvenient facts have been expunged.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So one will not find in Hannah Arendt's voluminous writings,
whether on totalitarianism or on Jews, or on both, the smallest hint as
to what Jewish society in Germany was really like in the 18th century: burning
of books, persecution of writers, disputes about the magic powers of amulets,
bans on the most elementary 'non-Jewish' education such as the teaching
of correct German or indeed German written in the Latin alphabet. Nor can
one find in the numerous English-language 'Jewish histories' the elementary
facts about the attitude of Jewish mysticism (so fashionable at present
in certain quarters) to non-Jews: that they are considered to be, literally,
limbs of Satan, and that the few non-satanic individuals among them (that
is, those who convert to Judaism) are in reality 'Jewish souls' who got
lost when Satan violated the Holy Lady (Shekhinah or Matronit, one of the
female components of the Godhead, sister and wife of the younger male God
according to the cabbala) in her heavenly abode. The great authorities,
such as Gershom Scholem, have lent their authority to a system of deceptions
in all the 'sensitive' areas, the more popular ones being the most dishonest
and misleading.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the social consequence of this process of liberalisation
was that, for the first time since about AD 200, a Jew could be free to
do what he liked, within the bounds of his country's civil law, without
having to pay for this freedom by converting to another religion. The freedom
to learn and read books in modern languages, the freedom to read and write
books in Hebrew not approved by the rabbis (as any Hebrew or Yiddish book
previously had to be), the freedom to eat non-kosher food, the freedom to
ignore the numerous absurd taboos regulating sexual life, even the freedom
to think - for 'forbidden thoughts' are among the most serious sins - all
these were granted to the Jews of Europe (and subsequently of other countries)
by modern or even absolutist European regimes, although the latter were
at the same time antisemitic and oppressive. Nicholas I of Russia was a
notorious antisemite and issued many laws against the Jews of his state.
But he also strengthened the forces of 'law and order' in Russia - not only
the secret police but also the regular police and the gendarmerie - with
the consequence that it became difficult to murder Jews on the order of
their rabbis, whereas in pre-1795 Poland it had been quite easy. 'Official'
Jewish history condemns him on both counts. For example, in the late 1830s
a 'Holy Rabbi' (Tzadik) in a small Jewish town in the Ukraine ordered the
murder of a heretic by throwing him into the boiling water of the town baths,
and contemporary Jewish sources note with astonishment and horror that bribery
was 'no longer effective' and that not only the actual perpetrators but
also the Holy Man were severely punished. The Metternich regime of pre-1848
Austria was notoriously reactionary and quite unfriendly to Jews, but it
did not allow people, even liberal Jewish rabbis, to be poisoned. During
1848 when the regime's power was temporarily weakened, the first thing the
leaders of the Jewish community in the Galician city of Lemberg (now Lvov)
did with their newly regained freedom was to poison the liberal rabbi of
the city, whom the tiny non-Orthodox Jewish group in the city had imported
from Germany One of his greatest heresies, by the way, was the advocacy
and actual performance of the Bar Mitzvah ceremony, which had recently been
invented.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberation from Outside</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the last 150 years, the term 'Jew' has therefore acquired
a dual meaning, to the great confusion of some well-meaning people, particularly
in the English-speaking countries, who imagine that the Jews they meet socially
are 'representative' of Jews 'in general'. In the countries of east Europe
as well as in the Arab world, the Jews were liberated from the tyranny of
their own religion and of their own communities by outside forces, too late
and in circumstances too unfavourable for genuine internalised social change.
In most cases, and particularly in Israel, the old concept of society, the
same ideology - especially as directed towards non-Jews - and the same utterly
false conception of history have been preserved. This applies even to some
of those Jews who joined 'progressive' or leftist movements. An examination
of radical, socialist and communist parties can provide many examples of
disguised Jewish chauvinists and racists, who joined these parties merely
for reasons of 'Jewish interest' and are, in Israel, in favour of 'anti-Gentile'
discrimination. One need only check how many Jewish 'socialists' have managed
to write about the kibbutz without taking the trouble to mention that it
is a racist institution from which non-Jewish citizens of Israel are rigorously
excluded, to see that the phenomenon we are alluding to is by no means uncommon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is important to note that all the supposedly 'Jewish
characteristics'- by which I mean the traits which vulgar so-called intellectuals
in the West attribute to 'the Jews'- are modern characteristics, quite unknown
during most of Jewish history, and appeared only when the totalitarian Jewish
community began to lose its power. Take, for example, the famous Jewish
sense of humour. Not only is humour very rare in Hebrew literature before
the 19th century but humour and jokes are strictly forbidden by the Jewish
religion- except, significantly, jokes against other religions. The critical
sense, which is supposedly so characteristic of Jews, was totally absent,
and nothing was so forbidden, feared and therefore persecuted as the most
modest innovation or the most innocent criticism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was a world sunk in the most abject superstition, fanaticism
and ignorance, a world in which the preface to the first work on geography
in Hebrew (published in 1803 in Russia) could complain that very many great
rabbis were denying the existence of the American continent and saying that
it is 'impossible'. Between that world and what is often taken in the West
to 'charactercise' Jews there is nothing in common except the mistaken name.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, a great many present-day Jews are nostalgic for
that world, their lost paradise, the comfortable closed society from which
they were not so much liberated as expelled. A large part of the zionist
movement always wanted to restore it -and this part has gained the upper
hand. Many of the motives behind Israeli politics, which so bewilder the
poor confused western 'friends of Israel', are perfectly explicable sense
which this word has had for the last two hundred years: a forced and in
many respects innovative, and therefore illusory, return to the closed society
of the Jewish past.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Sounds of Silence</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E. Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Najah Taffal was born deaf. This means that she has never
heard the sound of falling rain, the magic ripple of her children's laughter
or the agonies of their cries, the songs of early morning birds or any other
sounds that we may find either annoying or precious to our ears and which
we tend to take for granted. She was born twenty-eight years ago in Amman
and when she was old enough, attended the Salt School for the Deaf until
the sixth grade. She then left school and started to learn sewing but also
quit because she didn't like it. When she was fourteen and a half years
old, she got married to a deaf man and had three children. While marriage
for a young deaf girl could have seemed like the end of all hope for any
kind of decent future and may well have fated her to do menial jobs, Najah's
marriage apparently gave birth to the emergence of her true spirit of resolve
and determination to not only better her life but the lives of as many deaf
people as she can.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When I first met Najah the clean modern Specialized Audiology
Centre in Jordan, I sensed that she was a bright young woman and I saw excitement
and spirit flash in her dark eyes as she tried to converse with me in her
native tongue-sign language. To my distress, Manal Hamzeh, the director
of the centre, left Najah and me alone for a few minutes to see how well
we could communicate together and to give me a chance to almost feel how
it is to be deaf. As soon as Manal went out of the room, I perceived that
I was the one who was deaf for there was no effective way for me to adequately
express myself or understand her. Before this isolation I had noticed how
well she and Manal could converse with each other in sign language and how
I enviously watched them as if I were hearing a new and strange language
for the first time, a complete foreigner, for Manal and Najah were quite
fluent in the language. However, Najah and I sat down at a round white table
and tried to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. We ended up by laughing at
our efforts while we tried to draw silly pictures and make gestures but
we didn't make much progress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Manal saved me from further embarrassment and from then
on served as our mutual interpreter. Through her I learned that Najah studied
both Arabic and English typing even though she couldn't hear. She is presently
employed at the Specialized Audiology Centre and makes use of her typing
skills. Before she came to work with Manal, she was the first deaf woman
to work as a government employee in a position she held for two years. She
also became interested in establishing a deaf women's club because there
weren't any but there were deaf men's clubs. Deaf women had been left out,
therefore, the National Speech and Hearing Centre where she worked, encouraged
her to start one. In addition, some friends came from the United States
and persuaded the centre to each sign language and interpreting. The Centre
wisely understood that the best person suited to teach such courses was
a deaf one, hence, Najah began her second job as instructor of sign language.
She published the first sign language book in Jordan which contained about
300 symbols for sign language.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Parents of deaf children were also prompted to learn sign
language. Previously, communication between parents and their deaf children
was almost impossible, but courses in sign language enabled these parents
to correspond with their children. Najah consequently started teaching courses
for the deaf at the University of Jordan through the Friends of Handicapped
Students for a period of three months. At present, all deaf clubs give these
courses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since Najah believes it is her duty to help all deaf people,
she went on a trip to the Society For The Handicapped in Gaza. The situation
there differs sharply from that in Jordan, for Gaza is a very difficult
place to live in due to extreme overcrowding and the conditions of occupation
and oppression. It is often the case that people all over the world stigmatize
the deaf as handicapped and therefore, lacking intelligence. True, being
deaf is indeed a handicap, but then every person has some sort of handicap
or other and deafness is an obstacle that can be surmounted by the improvement
of other senses which become more acute and further, being deaf has nothing
to do with how smart or stupid a person is. In Gaza, Najah taught her course
to fifty teachers who work in home intervention programs and she raised
their awareness about language and deafness. Besides teaching such courses,
she went to some homes of deaf children who were taking classes and realized
that the sign language level there was too low. It is imperative that deaf
children have continuous contact with each other. They shouldn't be isolated
in their homes, for no man is an island, but exposed to role models of deaf
adults. Najah recommended this idea to the director of the society. She
also aims to gather and develop deaf leaders who are proud of themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She insists that it is vital all mothers of deaf children
learn sign language. When the Gaza mothers saw her, they were very surprised
and asked, &quot;Are you really deaf? You are so smart and active!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Najah's goal is not to be on her own as a deaf leader,
but to concentrate on procuring other leaders. In Gaza, the Society For
The Handicapped approved the sign language program that she will be a big
part of. At this time, there are no deaf clubs there, unlike Jordan where
there are many now. People in Gaza are very suppressed. Najah hopes by working
hard in three to four years the Gazans will have their own clubs. She finds
Gaza to be a great challenge inspite of the occupation and the intense effort
required of her. She doesn't mind working to improve things. Even without
a degree, there is an inborn talent in her to teach her mother tongue which
is sign language. She has also written and organized courses for sign language
and the Ministry of Social Development is taking her course curriculum as
a guide for other clubs to give and use. Such courses are best taught by
a deaf person and not a hearing one. This is the first time that a real
guide has been employed for these courses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As mentioned earlier, Najah has three children. Even though
their parents are both deaf, the children hear. The eldest son now about
13 interprets for his mother. All the children attend private schools in
order to have a good background in both Arabic and English. Najah knows
the importance of giving her children the advantage of a good education
because she didn't have such an opportunity. Her son wants to attend college
and work with the deaf when he grows up but his mother says that he must
make h is own decisions. Whatever she has lost in sound and education, she
more than makes up for these shortcomings with an automatic mind which keeps
innovating things to do for the deaf. It is her dream that the deaf in Jordan
will be like those in America with the same opportunities. She is very fortunate
to have a patient and wise husband who lets her be what she must and lets
her struggle for those goals that make her life have meaning.<BR>
