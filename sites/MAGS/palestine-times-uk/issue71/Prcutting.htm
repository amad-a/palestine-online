<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a far-reaching strategic development with implications
beyond the Middle East, Iran, with the help of Russian experts, two weeks
ago tested components of a long-range missile capable of hitting Israel,
the Israeli Air Force's commander has said. According to Israel, the missile
will have a range of 950 miles, more than twice that of any now in Tehran's
arsenal. Earlier, Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, gave a
warning that Iran was trying to develop ballistic missiles to strike not
only at Israel but also at Western nations. Last night senior diplomatic
sources said that the rapid advance in Iran's missile capability, combined
with its efforts-again with Russian help-to acquire a nuclear capability,
had increased the chances that Israel may launch a pre-emptive strike similar
to that mounted against Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in June 1981.<B><I>The

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>General Mordechai (Israeli defence minister) declined to
follow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's lead in blaming the current impasse
on what he considers to be poor agreements that Mr. Rabin signed with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. &quot;I am not happy with the Oslo agreement,
but it's the agreement we have,&quot; said General Mordechai, who is retired
from the army. &quot;Do you think it's going to help me to say, 'It's bad,
it's weak,' and so on? We have to improve it and make it work.&quot; <B><I>The
International Herald Tribune, April 15, 1997.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Regardless of whether the Israeli attorney-general, Elyakim
Rubinstein, decides to press charges against Binyamin Netanyahu, it seems
clear that the prime minister's days in office are numbered. Ten months
after his election triumph, Mr. Netanyahu appears to be near the end of
his political career. Even if Mr. Rubinstein rejects police recommendations
to indict the prime minister on criminal charges of fraud and breach of
trust, there is serious doubt whether he can cling on. Many Israelis wonder
whether the prime minister can continue to operate as if nothing has changed.
Some argue that the past 10 months of Mr. Netanyahu's government have been
the worst in the history of the Jewish state.<B><I>The Guardian, April 18,

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has credited
the Palestinians with co-operation in locating the body of Sergeant Sharon
Edri..He had apparently been kidnapped and killed by a Hamas cell based
in Kafr Tsurif (Surif), near Hebron..Mr. Netanyahu, speaking during a visit
to Holland, said the Palestinian Authority's arrest of two members of the
Hamas cell had led to the locating of the soldier's body. But Israeli media
reports this week suggested that the Palestinians' role in locating the
body of Sergeant Edri-and in uncovering the Hamas cell in Tsurif allegedly
responsible for the deaths of Edri and 10 other Israelis-may have gone far
deeper than Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged. <B><I>The Jewish Chronicle, April

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Among the fancy new villas (in Gaza), fanciest is that
of Abu Mazen, key negotiator of the ill-fated Oslo accord. It is not clear
who paid for this $2 million-plus affair, all balconies and balustrades
in gothic profusion, but the graffiti which some irreverent scoundrel scrawled
on its wall proclaimed that &quot;this is your reward for selling Palestine&quot;..Umm
Jihad, the Minister of Social Affairs, is an icon of the revolution, both
in her own right and as the widow of the Palestinians' best-loved &quot;martyr-,
Abu Jihad, whom an Israeli hit team assassinated in Tunis in 1988. But even
she is building a villa to rival Abu Mazen's; and even she has been spotted
shopping in Tel Aviv's Dizengoff Street. <B><I>David Hirst writes from Gaza,

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The 185-nation assembly voted against the Har Homa settlement
by 134 to three, with only Israel, America and Micronesia against. Germany
abstained. The General Assembly first condemned the settlement project last
month. However, it took up the subject again, holding its first emergency
session since 1982, after the United States cast its veto twice in the 15-nation
Security Council to shield Israel from criticism. <B><I>The Times, April
