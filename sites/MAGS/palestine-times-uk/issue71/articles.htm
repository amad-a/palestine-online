<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Why should we be denied the right to live
or die in Jerusalem?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Mahmoud al Khatib</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hind's father did not think for a minute that the decision
made by the Israeli Ministry of Internal Security to confiscate his Jerusalem
residency permit last month would prevent him from burying his daughter
in his family's cemetery in the Holy City.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mustafa Diyab had been shocked twice in two days. First,
the Ministry did not allow his wife, Maryam, who was also his cousin but
who holds a Jordanian passport, to live with him in Jerusalem. The next
day, he went to the same Ministry to get a death certificate for his 12-year-old
daughter, Hind. The Israeli officials told him to get the certificate from
the Palestinian Authority and denied him the right to bury her in his family's
cemetery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian family was forced to bury their daughter
in the village of Kufr Aqeb to the north of occupied Jerusalem. The village,
in which the Diyab family were living, was outside Jerusalem borders, according
to the Israeli Jerusalem Municipality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli arbitrary measures, which have denied more
than 50,000 Jerusalem Palestinians the right to maintain their residency
permits in the Holy City, have become a serious threat to thousands of Jerusalem
families who were forced for one reason or another to live outside the official
borders of &quot;Greater Jerusalem&quot; set by the Israeli municipal authorities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In May last year, a 3-month-old Palestinian baby died after
being denied the right of obtaining medical treatment at the Israeli Hadassa
Hospital in occupied Jerusalem. Baby Hanin needed an urgent heart operation
and her doctors recommended Hadassa Hospital for the surgery. But the Israeli
national insurance establishment decided that Hanin had no right to medical
insurance although her mother was covered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>They alleged that the mother, a Jerusalem resident, lost
the right to medical insurance because she had lost the right to reside
in Jerusalem after marrying a Palestinian holding a Jordanian passport.
Medical insurance is given only to Israelis and Jerusalem Palestinians who
carry Israeli residency permits, they said. However, the Israeli law gives
Hanin this right since her mother had an Israeli residency permit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli officials alleged that the mother failed to
prove that she was a legal Jerusalem resident, in spite of the fact that
Hanin's mother was living in the heart of the old city of Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An official at the Jerusalem-based Centre for Palestinian
Civil and Social Rights warned of the Israeli arbitrary measures against
the civil rights of Jerusalem Palestinians. Azmi Abul Saud said that hundreds
of Palestinian children similar to Hanin could be denied the right to life
and to obtain medical treatment as well as their right to be buried in their
city. &quot;This is happening, although the Israeli national insurance is
committed to cover all residents with health insurance,&quot; he added.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli regulation was issued at the beginning of 1995
stating that in order for Palestinians to obtain health insurance, they
should be living within the Jerusalem borders set by the Israeli Municipality
of the Holy City. These borders were approved by the Israeli government
earlier this year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abul Saud revealed that the new Israeli measures led the
Israeli Hadassa Hospital to expel Palestinian patients who suffer from chronic
and serious diseases. The patients allegedly lost their right of residency
in Jerusalem because they changed their place of residence within Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Citing examples of the tragedies of the Jerusalemite patients,
Abul Saud said that the Israeli hospital expelled Mustafa Karaki, who was
being treated for lung cancer, just because his house was outside the municipal
borders of Jerusalem. Sultan Shabana, who was undergoing kidney dialysis,
was also told not to come back for the same reason, the Palestinian official
said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Centre is planning to commemorate Hanin
who was denied the right to life by preventing her from getting medical
treatment. The Centre will organize a humanitarian demonstration to expose
Israeli ethnic cleansing against Palestinian residents of Jerusalem. Representatives
of international medical and humanitarian organizations as well as the Red
Cross will participate in the demonstration to protest against Israeli arbitrary
measures which affect more than 70,000 Jerusalemite residents who face expulsion
from the Holy City.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli authorities offer to grant Israeli citizenship
to the Jerusalemite residents as the only solution to sustain the right
of residency in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Abu-Marzook Affair and What it Means
for American Justice</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Stanley L. Cohen</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PT: By the time this month's paper has been issued, Dr.
Mousa Abu Marzook should be released and deported to Jordan, an Arab country
willing to receive the Hamas leader by permission of its Monarch, King Hussein.
Even though the article, which was written by one of Abu Marzook's qualified
and well-known defence lawyers, sheds disturbing light on the American so-called
justice system, we still opted to print it for the facts and realities contained
therein.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After more than twenty-two months of imprisonment in the
United States for crimes alleged by the State of Israel, Dr. Mousa Mohammed
Abu Marzook now stands vindicated of all charges, following Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to abandon, &quot;for security
purposes,&quot; their attempts to extradite him. Indeed, it has been Dr.
Abu Marzook's steadfast position since his arrest at New York's Kennedy
Airport in July, 1995, that Israel never wanted him to stand trial there,
that they never had a plausible case against him. We now know, after almost
two years of Justice Department duplicity and a grotesque legal pantomime
in the federal courts of this country, that the United States itself at
best has colluded with Israel at every level to deprive Dr. Abu Marzook
of his freedom, strip him of his dignity and reputation, and abuse his rightful
position as a leader of the Palestinian people. Worse yet, it has permitted
pressure from Israeli and American Jewish sources to manipulate and destroy
the process due him, a lawful U.S. resident.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For more than fifteen years, Hamas has struggled on behalf
of its people and has earned their respect, from its educational and social
programs to its thorough revival of Islamic identity among the residents
of Gaza and the West Bank. Yet their militant and unflagging commitment
to freeing their land of Israeli oppression has made them a force with which
Israel would rather not carry on a dialogue. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From the beginning, Dr. Abu Marzook has met Israel's criminal
charges openly and sincerely, vigorously denying any and all guilt while
opposing with all the resources he could muster the United States Justice
Department's attempts to extradite him. Finally tiring of endless bad faith
on the part of the U.S. and Israeli prosecutions, as well as the clear,
pro-Israeli bias on the part of the Federal judge who initially decided
his fate, he has withdrawn his legal opposition to extradition, in effect
saying, &quot;You want me to stand trial--I will go willingly and fight
these charges.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Having called Israel's bluff, Dr. Abu Marzook has forced
them at last to reveal their craven agenda for the ruse it has always has
been.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Who could believe at the time of Dr. Abu Marzook's arrest
that Israel truly intended to carry out their extradition of him? Surely
they knew then, as they are forced to admit now, that his presence in an
Israeli courtroom, facing baseless charges which the Israeli government
knew it could never substantiate, would hardly further the &quot;peace process.&quot;
Surely they knew then, as they solemnly confess now, that such a trumped-up
action against a legitimate spokesman for Palestinian national aspirations,
and a man welcomed as a leader by Muslim nations throughout the region,
could only enflame the hatred of Hamas' considerable base of support in
Gaza and the West Bank, erupting with terrible consequences for all involved--Israeli
and Palestinian alike. So it remains now to ask, if these realities have
been obvious to any casual observer, much less to professional political
strategists, then how is it Dr. Abu Marzook has been incarcerated here by
the United States government, separated from his wife and children, deprived
of his freedom and dignity for these long months--all for the sake of a
foreign power whose insincerity in this matter has never been in question?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The answer, unfortunately, is unpleasant for any American
who has held this nation's constitutional stability and standards of fairness
in high esteem. The vision of sanctity and inviolability that, in the best
of all worlds, guides our independent judiciary has long been--at least
in theory--one of this country's greatest constitutional bulwarks against
tyrrany. Yet in the Abu Marzook affair, a clear example of the corruption
of our federal judiciary by the political will of the executive branch stands
now, unrepudiated, as an indictment of the system. Simply put, the action
against Dr. Abu Marzook was conceived when the Israeli Cabinet hardly a
branch of our judiciary, or even Israel's--resolved that he should be arrested
and detained. The U.S. government did not detain Dr. Abu Marzook because
an American judge had found probable cause that he had committed a crime--rather,
it detained him because non-judicial officials at the State Department asked
that he be detained, and the government bent the rules to detain him as
if this constituted a legal basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To review the legal charade fostered by the federal courts,
we need only look at their halting record of proceedings against Dr. Abu
Marzook. Initially, the United States detained Dr. Abu Marzook at Kennedy
Airport without a warrant, and indeed without any charges whatsoever. Then,
the government purported to hold him-still without specific charges-for
exclusion, although as a permanent resident alien summary exclusion procedures
were legally inapplicable. Their reason? Because the government wanted to
minimize, if possible, any due process of law for Dr. Abu Marzook, and it
had no charges that it could legitimately assert. Indeed, to this day the
only charges asserted by the government to justify any exclusion proceeding
are predicated on Israel's allegations, which they now drop. And these very
allegations were based entirely upon a &quot;confession&quot; obtained under
torture, which was later recanted by the tortured man. Since when has American
justice allowed the product of torture to stand as evidence in its federal
courts?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Then, the government brought an extradition proceeding
to extradite Dr. Abu Marzook to Israel, except that Israel had not actually
assembled evidence that he was guilty of extraditable crimes when the government
brought the proceeding, forcing the United States government to ask for
more time during which Dr. Abu Marzook was detained, still without a proper
predicate for holding him or the slightest demonstration that he is a danger
to public safety. Next, the government--less than two weeks after it had
hastily brought its improper exclusion proceedings --asked the Court for
permission to abate these proceedings while it brought the extradition proceeding,
based on a statute that had been declared unconstitutional on the very grounds
that it ceded judicial independence to the State Department. Now, with Dr.
Abu Marzook's extradition unopposed yet ironically undesired by Israel itself,
the exclusion proceeding will begin again, and delaying it would mean that
the government could seek to hold Dr. Abu Marzook without legal basis for
years--the very situation Dr. Abu Marzook's defense team predicted would
occur when its request for simultaneous exclusion and extradition proceedings
was denied at the beginning of this case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel's &quot;special relationship&quot; with the United
States, forged over years of shared military and strategic interests in
the Mid-East, is hardly a state secret. American citizens are free to support,
oppose or ignore this fact of United States foreign policy as they wish--it
is fundamentally a reality created by successive administrations of the
Executive Branch of government, fostered by the Legislative Branch through
approval of funds, laws and oversight, and implemented by the State Department,
which is the President's prerogative. Yet the Judicial Branch of our government
is meant to be free of any of these considerations when weighing the freedom
and life of a man in its hands. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>conclude, after a careful examination of the Abu Marzook
affair--which remains unresolved as of this writing, as Dr. Abu Marzook
sits in the Metropolitan Correctional Center still--that Israel's legendary
power lobby in Washington is much greater than any have dared say before.
While its influence over State Department Mid-East policy has been born
of the symbiosis of U.S. and Israeli policy objectives in the region, such
relationships have long been the prerogative of the executive branch, for
better or worse. But now the chilly hand of international and domestic political
lobbying has reached out to shape our nominally impartial federal judiciary-using
tortured confessions, subterfuge, and racist, anti-Islamic hysteria to further
Israel's agenda in the Occupied Territories. That our federal courts and
judges have been party to such craven cynicism is only a part of the injustice
here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For beyond these considerations, there is Dr. Abu Marzook
himself, who has been imprisoned and humiliated by the U.S. Justice Department
for these past twenty-two months. His wife and children, residents of Virginia,
have been forced to travel long hours for their weekly meetings with Mousa,
putting great hardship on the family. The children must bear the strain
of seeing their father in a New York City jail cell, far from home, while
Dr. Abu Marzook's wife has had to carry the household responsibilities alone.
His aged parents in the Occupied Territories have no contact with their
son; indeed, as Dr. Abu Marzook's father declines in health, there is the
very real possibility that he may never see his father again. In addition,
Dr. Abu Marzook's religious life has been disrupted: isolated from the Islamic
community, unable to participate in weekly Friday jum'aa prayers, and deprived
of contact with his imam or a personal religious advisor, he has had to
practice his faith as best he can, in the noisy, sordid environment of a
maximum security prison wing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet, for Dr. Abu Marzook's part, he accepts what has befallen
him with the stoic reserve of a man who has dedicated his life to the national
struggle of his people. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza have suffered jailing, torture and death at the hands of Israel's
security forces in the Occupied Territories --any historic human struggle
for independence is not without its continuing human costs. Indeed, Mousa's
own family's expulsion from the Gaza farm of his boyhood in the great displacement
of Palestinians that followed Israeli statehood in 1948 has framed his life
in terms of nothing but this struggle to restore his people to their rightful
heritage. In the context of the life he has given to this fight, jail and
persecution are mere setbacks along the road to freedom.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>March Uprising&oacute;a Preparation for a
Jerusalem Battle</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Maha Abdel Hadi</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus- </FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE=+1>Before the Israeli
Minister of Internal Security Avigdor Kahalani entered the office of his
boss on 26 February to make the final decision on building a Jewish settlement
on Jabal Abu Ghneim in occupied East Jerusalem, he rushed to tell reporters
that &quot;the struggle for Jerusalem has started.&quot; He added haughtily
that by making that decision, he would establish the fact that Jerusalem
was the capital of the Jewish people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kahalani might be right by saying that the battle for Jerusalem
had started, but he was wrong when he and his government thought that the
issue would end with the decision to build the settlement. The battle for
Jerusalem had been opened on all fronts and no Israeli government, Likud
or Labour, could retreat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When the Israeli bulldozers started working on Jabal Abu
Ghneim settlement (Har Homa), a new Palestinian intifada (uprising) erupted.
This renewed last September's al Aqsa intifada following the Israeli decision
to open a tunnel under al Aqsa Mosque. The new intifada is no doubt endangering
the rightist government of Benjamin Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All now know that the coming explosion will be all-consuming.
Its starting point is well-defined but no one will be able to predict how
and when it will end. The Tel Aviv government has prepared its army for
a comprehensive confrontation with the Palestinian people and has sent additional
troops to the borders of the Palestinian territories to suppress any protests
against the construction of the new settlement in occupied East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the other hand, the Palestinian Authority is practically
avoiding intervening in the intifada in an attempt to make the revolution
appear as a &quot;natural&icirc; popular reaction to Israeli aggression.
The PA security officials issue statements every day stressing that they
are well aware of their 'security duties' within the framework of the Oslo
Accords signed with the Israelis. However, the Israeli government is still
saying it is not satisfied with the PA's commitments to these Accords, especially
those points pertaining to security.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians in the occupied territories are frustrated
and disappointed. They have lost any hope of restoring their legitimate
rights. They thought that the Oslo Accords would relieve them from Israeli
occupation. On the contrary, they discovered that their territories are
still being occupied and could be confiscated at any time by occupation
troops. This was what first sparked off the Palestinian uprising. Even PA
officials and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council are humiliated
by Israeli soldiers at the numerous checkpoints.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli decision regarding the opening of a tunnel
in the holy city of Jerusalem last September was the second spark which
set off the Palestinian people in rebellion against the vices and atrocities
of the Israelis. Palestinian mass demonstrations and confrontations with
the Israeli soldiers erupted, killing about 70 Palestinians and injuring
more than 1,500 others in less than five days. Nineteen Israeli soldiers
were killed and dozens injured in the confrontations, making last September's
intifada the bloodiest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abu Ghneim settlement was the third spark which angered
the Palestinians who are well aware of the Israeli plans to Judaize occupied
East Jerusalem. Eight Palestinians have so far been killed and more than
1,000 injured in the present intifada which erupted in Hebron, Ramallah,
Bethlehem and a number of neighbouring villages.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The most violent confrontations between Palestinians and
occupation soldiers and/or Jewish settlers were reported in Hebron. The
Hebronites penetrated the buffer zones between the so-called H1 and H2 areas
and stoned Israeli soldiers and settlers. The Israelis used live ammunition
and rubber bullets, which are fatal if shot from a short distance, as well
as dangerous kinds of tear gas in order to disperse the demonstrators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It seems that Netanyahu has not learned from the mistakes
of his predecessor Peres. In a show of power, Peres ordered the assassination
of Engineer Yahya Ayyash. The Palestinian reaction was violent resulting
in several suicide bombings which dashed Peres' hopes to win the elections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu blindly follows Peres' policies but in a somewhat
different fashion. Peres had succeeded in obtaining help from the Palestinian
Authority to spy on the military activities of Hamas and other opposition
factions. But Netanyahu is not content to suppress only Hamas; he wants
the PA to suppress any Palestinian opposing his stupid policies. In other
words, he wants to suppress all the Palestinian people. In order to force
the PA to take stricter measures against opposition factions, the Israeli
government has suspended talks with the PLO on the final status of Jerusalem
and Jewish settlements but will continue talks on security issues only.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel accused Arafat of giving a 'green light' to Hamas
to resume its suicide bombings during his meeting with Hamas leaders in
Gaza after his visit to Washington. But the Israelis should know better.
Arafat had tried to stop the bombings but failed, despite his efforts and
the efforts of his security officers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Likud and Labour parties agree on the settlement plans
adopted by the Israeli government.The Labour member of the Knesset, Yori
Ore, has said: &euml;When the bulldozers come up to Har Homa (Abu Ghneim),
there are no opposition groups in Israel. It is Jews against Palestinians.
I hope the Palestinians will understand that and calm down the situation.
Today we have one objective; to proceed in the construction of Har Homa
(!)&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli parties may not be aware of the indications
and consequences of the new intifada, which includes the Abu Ghneim intifada
and the military escalations such as the Tel Aviv and the Baqoura (in Jordan)
operations. Israelis will have made a mistake if they believe that they
can contain the impact of their decisions concerning Jerusalem. There will
be no security or stability unless they withdraw from Arab East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>More Human Rights Abuses in Palestine</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Robert W. McGee*</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights abuses continued as usual in Palestine last
month. Palestinian property continued to be confiscated or blown up. Torture
of prisoners continued. And the United States unconditional support for
Israel was unwavering.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most of these human rights abuses either go unreported
in the American press, or if they are reported, are done so in some sanitized
fashion so as to not inflame the hearts, minds and consciences of the many
Americans who would be truly outraged if they knew what their tax dollars
were going to support.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Recent Israeli army activity has been especially outrageous.
The Israeli army has been collectively punishing and brutalizing the village
of Surif by various acts of violence. It has imposed and lifted several
curfews, which caused severe shortages of basic foodstuffs. Israeli soldiers
routinely take shots at Surif residents who venture out of their homes to
get food. More than 200 have been injured. At least one person, Khalid Mustafa
Arar, died of a heart attack while relatives tried to get him to the hospital
during the curfew. His family was sprayed with rubber bullets and tear gas
when they tried to bury him. Had Palestinians attacked Israeli mourners,
it would have been the first story on the evening news in America.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian administrative detainees who have been imprisoned
without being charged or tried with any crime continue to be abused and
unjustifiably imprisoned. The commander of the Megiddo jail in Israel has
been told by top military commanders to open fire on prisoners if they protest
against their continued illegal detention. Their leaders are to be fired
upon with live bullets, rubber bullets or tear gas and are to have their
prison sentences extended. Detainees who move or fail to sit properly during
the prison count are also to be fired upon. Even non-violent protests such
as silent vigils and sit-ins are to be classified as insurrections.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Almost half of the 300 Palestinians who were illegally
arrested (in their own country by occupying forces) have been held for more
than a year. One-fourth of them have been held for two or more years. These
policies violate both international law and common human decency. Their
continued detention also violates the Oslo II accords, which the leaders
of the occupying Israeli government signed in 1995. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israelis destroyed the home of the Rashid family on the
outskirts of Hebron, thus causing 45 people to become homeless. Family members
were not allowed to remove furniture, clothing or other articles. To add
to the cruelty, Israeli bulldozers pushed the debris from the demolition
into a nearby cave where the family kept livestock to prevent the family
from using the cave for shelter. The home was destroyed because it was allegedly
built without a permit. But why should anyone need a permit to build on
their own property?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Human rights abuses continue unabated, year after year,
as the Zionist occupiers pursue genocidal policies not unlike those of the
Nazis during the early years of the Nazi regime. Yet the Clinton administration,
like administrations before his, continues to veto United Nations resolutions
to condemn illegal confiscation of property by the Israelis and their infamous
brutalities committed against the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestine Times Interviews Dr. Hassan
Turabi</FONT></I></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Democracy came through revolution and so
did Islam</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>There are no extremists among Muslims but
Westerners think themselves the world's centre</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Ghassan Abu Hussein</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Hassan al Turabi, now the speaker of the Sudanese parliament,
is the most prominent Islamic thinker and strategist. He has written several
books on Islam in both Arabic and English. Dr. al Turabi is fluent in both
English and French. However, this interview was conducted in Arabic and
then translated into English.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. About 25 years ago, you
called for the renewal of Islamic thought. After eight years in government,
what is the contribution the Sudanese Islamic movement has made in this
respect?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. Religion is being refreshed
among the people. The Islamic movement is no longer dominated by a small
number of Islamic scholars. Ijtihad (independent judgment of theological
questions) is now being made by the whole society in Sudan; it is no longer
exclusive to the scholars. All people contribute according to their acquisition
and understanding of the situation. The scholars know, of course, more than
the common people, but they interact with them. Our whole life is based
on the religion, and the transactions have become a part of our prayers.
Religion has become the common culture for the society.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. What are the main future
challenges facing the Islamic movements?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. Some of the Islamic movements
became bound by their attainments, even if they were few. Some of the movements
are prisoners of the past. A Muslim looks forward to the everlasting abode
and plans his life for that eternal life. He may exert all his efforts in
this life without waiting for the fruits of his achievements, since his
reward will be in that eternal life similar to the martyr. The members of
the Islamic movements, in general, do not look to the future nor do they
plan for it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic movement in Sudan began planning for higher
goals in the early 1980s, goals that seemed to be difficult to reach yet
they were realized in few years. We plan for this century and for the coming
century. Our country is rich with oil and natural resources as well as human
resources. The world is now gathering in regional blocs. We do not want
to be besieged or to be accused of spreading terrorism or fundamentalism.
They (the enemies of Sudan) plan, but we also plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The awakening of Islam has affected the life of the whole
Nation, which enables us to mobilize the Islamic potential in order to achieve
planned objectives. This is the main challenge. The leaders of the Islamic
movements are the most active and educated among Muslims. They are also
the best to know the real Islam. But what they introduce to the Islamic
Nation is not sufficient. The world, during the cold war, was divided into
two camps: capitalism and socialism. But now it has become without ideology
after the collapse of socialism. Parties were without strategies or programmes;
and religion in the West became non-existent. Our underdeveloped world which
follows the West and is fascinated by its glamour has become lost. Once
the people are lost, any leader will be able to guide them. This is a fact
of human history. We know the challenges before us; Islam itself has been
targeted since the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
But we should not worry. We want to tell the Muslims in the world that they
have a very wide range of opportunities: &quot;Wind blows against them from
this side, but water pours on them from the other side.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. A number of Islamic movements
came into power through democracy like Turkey and others through military
coups like in Sudan. Can the Islamic movements use force to rule if they
fail to do so through the polls?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. The intellectual, dialectic,
and Jihad (military) potentials should be combined in order to make cultural
transformations. This is a reality because the history of the world is like
that. Even democracy came about through revolutions. The economic changes
came through economic revolutions, and so too the revolutions of religion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Qur&iacute;an is clear. Allah orders us to invite people
to Islam with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and to argue with them in
ways that are best and most gracious. But we should be ready and cautious
in order not to be deceived. We should be ready for Jihad. Each country
has its own estimation and status. Force is only used against aggression.
The Sudanese opposition factions which claim to teach democracy to people
are the ones who are now killing democracy in Sudan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even in Turkey, I do not know what is going to happen in
the future. There are forces there which intervene in the most trifle of
issues like the people's style of dress. In Afghanistan, they did very well
in Jihad and had more than 1 million martyrs, but they were not ready to
govern. They proved Falsehood false and crushed it, but they were not ready
to justify the Truth. Nature does not know a vacuum. If a falsehood is removed
and you do not come or do not know how to establish truth or maintain it,
another falsehood will come as you see now. Our brothers in Algeria (the
Islamic Salvation Front) were involved in the democratic process without
having a methodology or an approach. I think if the Westerners had left
them reach to power, they would have proven to be a failure because they
did not know how to run an Islamic economy. They only say &quot;Islam is
the solution&quot;, but they do not know how to apply it.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. What is the difference between
piousness and extremism?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. We call it 'pigheadedness'
but not extremism. Extremism is a Western term; they use it because they
think themselves the centre of the world and our world is the Middle or
East. In fact, we are the centre of the world; we are the centre geographically
and religiously. They think that anyone who goes in a different direction
from them is an extremist. The more you abide by your religion, the more
extremist you become in their eyes. But the pigheadedness is another issue.
We should not be unduly strict.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If the Westerners liked you and you were resisting an enemy,
you would be labeled 'resistant', and if they liked you more, you would
be labeled a 'revolutionist'. But if they disliked or hated you, you would
be considered a 'terrorist'. We should not give in to their terminology
or criteria. We have our own criteria and terminology which we should introduce
to others through the best of means. We should be fair, pious and disciplined
while we continue to perform our religious duties. We should be justly balanced&oacute;pious
but not rash or pigheaded.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When we fight our enemies, we do not kill except those
who fight back at us. We do not kill their civilians or children even if
we are provoked by their atrocities. We do not fight our enemies by their
law of war but by our own law. The Qur&iacute;an is very clear in these
matters. We should be well-balanced.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. Some people call for a dialogue
with the West and others support clashing with them...</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. We should take the initiative
and open a dialogue with them. We should invite them, warn them, and give
them glad tidings, especially because we know their religion but they do
not know ours; we know their language and they do not know ours. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Regarding clashing, the initiative should be from the other
side. We are not allowed to be aggressive. The best conquer is not the conquering
of cities or countries, but the conquering of the hearts of people by the
light of Islam. Jihad is one of the elements of dialogue. We should be ready
for any aggression from the other party. Perhaps if the other party knew
that we are not able to fight him, he would not accept to start the dialogue
and would even crack down on us.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>49th anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>'Time does not heal all wounds, </FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>There are those that remain painfully open'</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By : Mare H.Ellis</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The writer is an American theologian, critical of Israeli
policies against the Palestinians, who has written several books on the
subject. The article below is an address he delivered at Birzeit University
last month commemorating the 49th anniversary of the Deir Yassin massacre.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Forty-nine years after the massacre of Deir Yassin, Palestinians
are still not free. Palestinian land is still occupied and the Palestinian
diaspora grows in numbers and longevity. Many Palestinians experience the
&quot;autonomy&quot; of Oslo as a pretence for a further diminution of Palestinian
life and possibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not the first time that peace in our century has
been implemented with such a heavy hand and with the pretence of innocence.
Nor is it the first time that a suffering people has empowered itself at
the expense of others and celebrated that empowerment as a divine promise.
And one can certainly argue from the extensive catalogue of suffering in
the 20th century that there are other peoples who have suffered more extensively
and intensively than the Palestinians have.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One thinks here of the millions killed in the Soviet Union,
China, Cambodia and, more recently of the hundreds of thousands slaughtered
in Rwanda. And of course the millions of Jews slaughtered in the heart of
Europe. In fact, it is the mass slaughter of Jews that fueled the creation
of the state of Israel and the ideology that justifies its actions, including
the displacement of the Palestinian People.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Perhaps it is paradoxical that the slaughter of Jews in
Europe led to the slaughter of Palestinians by Jews at Deir Yassin. Or perhaps
it is something more logical than paradoxical, in that the creation of a
Jewish state, like the creation of any state, depends on a certain amount
of violence. To create a Jewish state in an Arab country and region was
impossible without violence, and the massacre at Deir Yassin stands out
only in the extent of violence and the fact that the violence escalated
with the surrender of the villagers. This violence as recorded by eyewitnesses,
was savage beyond the needs of warfare, and this with the understanding
that war is horrible in and of itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From the perspective of Palestinian history, the savagery
at Deir Yassin was felt throughout Palestine and is only an extreme example
of what Palestinians experienced at the hands of Jewish soldiers. One thinks
here of the forced marches of thousands of civilians from Lydda and Ramle,
ordered as we know by Yitzhak Rabin with the permission of David Ben-Gurion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In some sense, almost the entire experience of Palestinians
at the hands of Jews and the Jewish state can be found in these two events:
the military and its excesses, conquering of land and villages, displacement
of civilians on a mass scale, the disruption and, in many case, the ending
of a rooted ad cultured life in the land of Palestine. In short, and perhaps
this is as significant as the larger questions pondered by academics and
politicians, Jews have disrupted and ended the ordinary lives of the Palestinian
people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is the horror of Deir Yassin reflected in the brutality
of the avenging Jewish soldiers and magnified for generations after. Battles,
even massacres, occur throughout history and though they can never be condoned,
let alone celebrated as Menachem Begin did with Deir Yassin, the possibility
of burial, mourning and, ultimately healing can Only be accomplished over
time with the generations that come after. These generations must be able
to see the dead within a larger framework and destiny to address the wounds
that exist long after the dead are buried.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Memory is contextual and needs a foundation in narrative
as well as geography. Can the dead be mourned, can they finally reach peace
for themselves and their descendants when the same history keeps unfolding
and the narrative and geography are limited by the same people who committed
the massacres? This is what Elie Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz, alluded
to on the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, when he wrote:
&quot;Time does not heal all wounds. There are those that remain painfully
open.&quot; Is there a way to heal the wounds that time does not? Perhaps
not for the victims and the survivors. But the question facing us is whether
the larger history of a people can be healed after these events of displacement
and murder. For these events rend the fabric of a people's history in ways
that are as horrific to the actual victims and can outlive those who were
present at the event itself. The formative event of destruction becomes
a collective wound through which a history of a people is felt and articulated.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The memory of Deir Yassin as part of the fabric of Palestinian
history awaits its final mission and destination, for one day it may fuel
a resistance to the rulers who subvert that memory of suffering with power
and political piety.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At the same time, it may provide a directed and humble
path towards a future beyond power and piety where the dead and those who
come after return in narrative and geography to nurture the ordinary life
of a people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The question of how Deir Yassin will function in Palestinian
memory and life is both independent of and, to some extent, dependent on
how this memory functions in Jewish life, for the wound in a people's history
is most often two-sided: those who are wounded and those who wound. Though
the pain of Deir Yassin is remembered by Palestinians, who among Jews remember
this tragedy? If Palestinians remember Deir Yassin in its individuality
and communal meaning, who among Jews remembers it in either dimension? At
least in mainstream Jewish writing one searches in vain for references to
Deir Yassin and if mentioned at all, it is in a context that buries the
tragedy in the struggle for the creation of the state of Israel, a goal,
at least to these writers, that far outweighs the tragedy which befell a
village and a people. Of course, the other events which make up the larger
tapestry of the displacement of the Palestinian people are similarly treated,
so that the individual horrors never add up to the corporate horror that
befell Palestine. By neglecting the suffering of the Palestinians, such
histories diminish Jewish culpability in that suffering and in a curious
way disjoin what such suffering creates: a shared history. How else could
those responsible for dislocation and death- Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Shamir,
Yitzhak Rabin and David Ben Gurion- emerge as heroes and ultimately prime
ministers?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whatever the reasons and justifications, however the importance
of Palestinian life is minimised, the reality is there for all to see: millions
of Palestinians who are refugees in their own land and outside of it and
Israelis who continue to occupy, displace, torture and murder long after
the creation of the state and even after the Oslo agreements, which are
ostensibly an attempt to end this history.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet even here the question remains: Do the Oslo agreements
attempt to recognise the joint history of Jew and Palestinian and therefore
the culpability of Jews in the displacement of the Palestinians, or do they
attempt to bury that history? Do the people of memory, the Jews, seek to
establish a political separation so that the Palestinian memory of Deir
Yassin will forever be separated from the Jewish people and state as a dangerous
memory which calls into question the Jewish claims of innocence and redemption?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>..(If) history is only seen as a continuum, a &quot;flow
of uninterrupted succession,&quot;' then the powerful are victorious and
the defeated are consigned to oblivion, until, of course, they rise up and
defeat the powerful and assume their place. If history is without interruption,
then morality, ethics, religious faith, is simply an exercise without possibility,
a piety without substance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is the &quot;gap in time&quot; we can make judgments,reconsider
our history, and resolve to take another road. Is despair, the desire for
the death of &quot;all of us,&quot; simply another way of saying that we
have let the continuum of history overwhelm our ability to change direction?
The gap in time is found in reflection, often in the silence where the individual
is separated from the world, and sometimes in the midst of a communal discussion
or action, even in an act of commemoration. Yet there is always a choice
involved, as Yad VaShem, in eyesight of Deir Yassin, plainly demonstrates.
For even memory can be mobilised to continue the cycle of destruction and
death as it too often has been in relation to the Holocaust. But then the
victims of destruction, even after they have emerged victorious, remain
unhealed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The history of atrocity suggests that at some point the
combatants become weary of battle and, as the corpses pile higher and higher,
more and more people seek another way of living with one another, a way
of justice and compassion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At different moments the &quot;gap in time&quot; seems
more propitious, as if the continuum has been broken and the stand against
past and future has made its point. Those moments are sometimes found in
celebration and at other times in mourning and commemoration. When those
moments are seized and acted upon, it is like a deep cry of history has
been heard.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the 49th anniversary of Deir Yassin, one of those moments
is upon us, awaiting our decision.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Dawayima Before 1948</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village was spread along the top of a wide rocky ridge
on the western side of the Hebron Mountains. It overlooked Wadi Qubayba
to the north and commanded a view of higher mountains to the east. Although
the entire area generally sloped down toward the south coastal plain, this
was not obvious from the village because hills to the west of it blocked
the view of the plain. A secondary road connected al-Dawayima to the village
of Idna, to the northeast. Yet another secondary road led from al-Dawayima
to al-Qubayba, to the northwest, and this in turn was linked to the al-Faluja-Bayt
Jibrin highway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The site of al-Dawayima has been tentatively identified
with the Old Testament village of Bozqat or Bosqat. In the late nineteenth
century, al-Dawayima stood on a high stony ridge that had olive groves beneath
it. On a higher ridge to the west stood a shrine that was topped by a white
dome. [SWP (1881) III:258]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The people of al-Dawayima were Muslims. They maintained
several religious shrines, chief among them the shrine of a Shaykh 'Ali.
This shrine had a large courtyard, a number of rooms, and one large hall
for prayers, and was surrounded by fig and carob trees and cactuses. It
attracted visitors from neighboring villages. [Hudayb 1985:541 A mosque
was located in the village center; it was maintained by the followers of
al-tariqa al-khalwatiyya, a Sufi mystic order founded by Shaykh 'Umar al-Khalwati,
who died in 1397. [Glasse 1989:221 l The villagers expanded and renovated
the mosque in the 1930s, and added a tall minaret. [Hudayb 1985:54]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village had a star-shaped layout, which permitted construction
to expand in all directions, particularly northeast and northwest along
the above-mentioned roads. Shops were scattered throughout the various neighborhoods
of the village center. Houses were made of stone and mud, separated by narrow
streets and alleys. The older houses were clustered closely together. Each
set of houses shared a hawsh, a large courtyard that provided space for
women to do their domestic chores, for children to play, and for families
to gather in the evening and on special occasions. As the village expanded
people began to build new houses outside of the village core. These new
houses were larger and built of whitewashed stone; some of them had thick,
stone walls and were called jidaris (from the Arabic word for wall, jidar).
Typically, each of these houses stood apart from the others and did not
form part of a hawsh. However, the floor plan of the new houses was the
same as that of the old. Each house had two levels: the upper level was
occupied by the family members and the lower level by their animals. The
houses of the well-to-do villagers had their own courtyards and large guest
rooms, in addition to animal stables. [Hudayb 1985:51-52]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Dawayima had an elementary school that was opened in
the village in 1937. [Hudayb 1985:65] The villagers obtained part of their
drinking water from wells that collected rainwater. In the 1940s they drilled
three new wells. During this period they also built numerous cisterns for
collecting rainwater. [Hudayb 1985:57]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rainfed agriculture was an important basis of al-Dawayima's
economy. The chief crops included a variety of grains, especially wheat,
barley, and maize; vegetables and fruits, especially figs and grapes, were
also cultivated. In 1944/ 45 the villagers allotted a total of 21,191 dunums
of their land to cereals; 1,206 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.
The rugged terrain around the village was covered with trees, such as oaks
and suwayd (Rhamnus Palestina).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Equally important to the village economy was animal husbandry.
There were twenty-seven clans, or hamulas, in the village [Hudayb 1985:32],
and every hamula owned an average of 200 to 300 head of goats or sheep,
and a few camels and cows. [Hudayb 1985:591 The villagers pastured their
animals on the large blocs of uncultivated land nearby.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition to agriculture and animal husbandry, the villagers
engaged in the spinning and weaving of tents and sacks for storing grain.
They also tanned hides and wove baskets for the market. [Hudayb 1985:60]
Al-Dawayima had about thirty to fifty small shops, ten butchers, and two
grain mills. The economy of the village became more dynamic in 1944 with
the introduction of a weekly Friday market. The market brought in residents
from other villages and towns, including Bayt Jibrin, Hebron, and Gaza,
who traded in produce, clothes, pastry, and other goods. The market was
held on the village's threshing floor and was called the suq al-barrayn
(&quot;the market of the two terrains&quot;) because it was believed to
combine the trade of the mountains and the plains. [Hudayb 1985:61]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Dawayima was built on an archaeological site. In addition,
a large number of khirbas lay in the vicinity. This suggests intense occupation
of the area in the past.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Dawayima was the site of one of the larger, little-known
massacres of the war. Carried out on 29 October 1948, during the Israeli
army's Operation Yo'av (see Barbara, Gaza District), the massacre precipitated
a massive flight of people from the area, according to Israeli historian
Benny Morris. He quotes a participant in the attack on the village as saying
that about 80 to 100 people, including women and children, were killed by
&quot;the first wave of conquerors.&quot; The following are excerpts of
a description published in the Israeli daily 'Al ha-Mishmar. The children
they killed by breaking their heads with sticks. There was not a house without
dead.... One commander ordered a sapper to put two old women in a certain
house ... and to blow up the house with them. The sapper refused.... The
commander then ordered his men to put in the old women and the evil deed
was done. One soldier boasted that he had raped a woman and then shot her....&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another description of the massacre was given by the former
mukhtar of the village, interviewed in 1984 by the Israeli daily Hadashot.
The mukhtar recalled: &quot;The people fled, and everyone they saw in the
houses, they shot and killed. They also killed people in the streets. They
came and blew up my house, in the presence of eye-witnesses.&quot; The mukhtar
added: &quot;The moment that the tanks came and opened fire, I left the
village immediately. At about half-past ten, two tanks passed the Darawish
Mosque. About 75 old people were there, who had come early for Friday prayers.
They gathered in the mosque to pray. They were all killed.&quot; The mukhtar
also said that about thirty-five families were hiding in caves outside al-Dawayima,
including some from the previously occupied village of al-. When the Israeli
forces discovered them, &quot;They told them to come out and get into line
and start to walk. And as they started to walk, they were shot by machine
guns from two sides.... We sent people there that night, who collected the
bodies, put them into a cistern, and buried them.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The mukhtar was taken back to the site of his village in
1984 for the first time since the massacre. He showed an Israeli journalist
where his home had been, as well as the cistern where the bodies had been
buried. A few days later, the journalist returned with four laborers. They
dug for a short while and discovered several human bones, including three
skulls-one of them a child's. They did not continue digging, but reburied
the bones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Morris writes that a number of investigations were launched
into the massacre, but does not mention what they found. They were generally
ineffectual and ended with the disciplining of some soldiers and the issuing
of a set of rules on treatment of Arab civilians by the Israeli army. The
unit responsible for the massacre was the Eighty-Ninth Battalion, which
was part of the Eighth Brigade, commanded by General Yitzchaq Sadeh, the
founder of the Palmach. Operation commander Yigal Allon told Sadeh to look
into the &quot;rumours,&quot; but his response is not given. [M:222-23;
Al-Fajr (Jerusalem), English-language edition, 719184, pp. 8-9]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In December 1948, during a general discussion of atrocities
by an Israeli ministerial committee, the issue of al-Dawayima was raised
again. Morris writes that Agriculture Minister Aharon Zisling was probably
reacting to a letter he received about this massacre, when he said: &quot;This
is something that determines the character of the nation.... Jews too have
committed Nazi acts.&quot; Although he complained that the investigation
was not proceeding as it should, he agreed with other ministers that Israel
should admit nothing outwardly, in order to preserve its image. [M:233-34]</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Dissident Jewish Voice</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By : Abraham Weizfeld</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oft-times the Jewish political culture is taken to be just
the Zionist political establishment. This is precisely what the Zionist
political parties wish to promote in order to justify their hegemony over
the Jewish people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite the virtual dictatorship of the Zionist ideology
over the Jewish people, a majority of Jewish people still do not live in
the State of Israel and do not wish to. The Jewish emigrants from Russia,
for example, prefer not to immigrate to Israel. However, the only political
voice heard representing the Jewish community internationally is the voice
of Zionism in spite of the non-Zionist character of the majority. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The reasons for this anomaly are that the Zionists seem
to offer the only solution for the existential crises of the Jewish people,
especially after the genocidal massacre of the European Jewish communities
by the Nazi chauvinists of various countries. The Allies did not offer much
to those who remained. Instead of conceding those Jewish areas that had
initially been liberated by Jewish partisans as a Jewish territory, the
Allies chose instead to support the occupation of Palestine by the Zionists
thus leading to the further depletion of European Jewry. The Stalinist Marxist
regime in the Soviet Union certainly would not have ceded any authority
over what used to be called the &igrave;Pale of Settlement&icirc; in the
western-most Ukraine. The pre-war alternative to the Zionist parties, called
the General Jewish Workers' Union (the Bund), was eliminated by both the
Nazis and the Stalinists and nothing remained to oppose the Zionist chauvinists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Currently the Peace Now opposition in Israel seems to be
the major opposition to Zionism among the Jewish people but despite its
occasional militant statements and demonstrations, it functions as the extra-parliamentary
support for the Labour Alignment which has been in the forefront of Israeli
expansionism. Nonetheless there has arisen various Jewish committees which
have expressed their opposition to Zionism as an ideology since the 1967
war of expansion. Now major academic figures are speaking out in the U.S.
Jewish milieu. In Canada, a number of committees have worked over the decades
to offer a Jewish alternative to Zionism inside the Jewish community and
the Jewish People's Liberation Organization (JPLO) represents their continuation
as well as the renewal of the old Bundist and Jewish partisan struggle against
Nazism and Fascism. The struggle against the racialist Nazi movement still
continues against formations such as the National Front as well as the old
war criminals hiding in various countries. Because the Zionists have adopted
the mentality of European Fascism and its worship of the exclusivist Nation-State,
the JPLO struggles against the Zionist parties as well. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The programme to oppose Zionism looks forward to the time
that pluralist societies will take the place of the Nation-State in order
to nurture a multi-national environment for the various peoples living together
to establish reciprocal relations. The following are the major points in
the JPLO programme:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. We call for a complete withdrawal of all the Israeli
military and intelligence services from the Palestinian territories occupied
by Israel during the 1967 war in accordance with U.N. resolutions. Withdrawal
from the occupied Lebanese and Syrian territories is also a necessary pre-condition
for peaceful relations between the Middle East countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. We call for the creation of a fully independent Palestinian
country; a Civil Society with all the powers of a State in accordance with
U.N. resolutions throughout the territories with full U.N. membership rights,
including East Jerusalem and serving as a democratic and pluralist territory
for all people of Palestinian origin, serving to reunite families continuing
to live in refugee camps throughout the Middle East region. Full voting
rights for all Palestinians who were forced to flee Palestine during the
1948 and 1967 wars or during the years of Israeli occupation, in addition
to holders of Israeli citizenship, are necessary for the Palestine National
Council. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3. The interim provisions of the peace process should lead
to the formation of a pluralist and bi-national Civil Society in the land
of Palestine, with a united Jerusalem. The return of Palestinians to their
historic origins shall be a right according to the civil constitution formed
by a Constitutional Assembly of all nations inhabiting Palestine. Recuperation
or compensation for familial properties of pre-1948 Palestine shall be established
by treaty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>4. We insist upon the establishment of a nuclear-free zone
throughout the region so that no country possesses or prepares nuclear,
biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction. Transport of material
used in the production of such devices shall be forbidden by all countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>5. We furthermore call for an end to sanctions against
Iraq, Iran and Libya, except for military arms sales restrictions that are
equally applied to all other key countries in the region.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>6. The JPLO seeks to liberate the individual civil and
collective rights of the Jewish people in the context of the various societies
where we reside. Our collective rights include provisions for national-cultural
autonomy in particular and auto-determination in general. In particular,
it must be recognized that anti-Jewish anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated
and refugee rights must be respected irrespective of the existence of the
Israeli State.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Algeria, to where?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Sheikh Rashed Ghannoushi*</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Algerian crisis reached its peak over the past few
months. Its cards were mixed and the unprecedented increase in victims made
it a prominent subject in both international news and political arenas despite
the attempts by the Algerian government to shield what is going on in its
country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The many victims as a direct result of the numerous massacres
obliged the political forces which supported the coup against democracy
and Islam in Algeria to speak up about this disaster which should be urgently
solved despite the different views among the foreign powers. France spoke
up for the first time about the necessity to put an end to the Algerian
crisis by allowing the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to participate in the
upcoming parliamentary elections, a call that annoyed the government and
the supporters of the military solution inside and outside Algeria. The
Americans, however, considered it a local crisis and indicated that they
would not interfere unless the Algerian government called upon them to do
so.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This difference in views between France and the United
States of America could be a part of the increasing polarization between
the two powers in the international arena and in Africa and the Middle East
in particular. It might also apply to the increasing influence of the Zionist
lobby in the US Administration which is totally biased against Islam and
the Islamic movements. Meanwhile, the French policy during President Chirac's
era proved to be a tendency towards the adoption of independent attitudes
which are often opposite to that of American policies. The French attitude
could extend and even meet with the attitudes of the Islamic movements arising
in the region and in North Africa in particular. Indications for this assumption
are clear in the French attitude towards Sudan, Iran and those countries
subject to the brute and unjust US sanctions such as those imposed against
Libya and Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The war in Algeria has become entangled in local and international
dimensions and will probably continue because certain army generals want
to control the power structure. Despite the internal disputes over power
and interests, which could explain the assassinations of President Bu Dhayaf
and more recently Ben Hamouda (head of the Labourers&iacute; Union), such
disputes are still being kept under control because of the cross interests
of those involved.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the combination of the escalation of the economic
crisis, the aspects of rebellion in the Algerian culture, and the military
experience the Islamic militias attained during the past few years, have
all contributed to a balance between the official and the popular violence
which has thrust the country into different prospects. Surely, President
Zirwal's promise to end the war in favour of the state and to exterminate
what he called &igrave;the terrorists&icirc; as well as to close forever
the FIS file is not one of those prospects. The events which followed his
promise made it unlikely to happen. Other probabilities are many, and all
agree on the return of the FIS to the political arena sooner or later. It
will come back either as a partner in the government or as a totally governing
party. The war will be settled either through peaceful negotiations and
power-sharing between the army and the opposition headed by the FIS or through
a popular uprising that crushes the army generals. The army could collapse
and some army groups might join the opposition and refuse to destroy the
country just to appease a few generals. What else is in the interest of
Algeria, the army and even President Zirwal himself in being so devout to
the military solution and in going ahead on a dead-end road except to achieve
some trifle personal interests?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is evident that the security, political and economic
situations in Algeria are ripe for an overall uprising. The situations are
being developed in favour of the opposition and not the ruling party. Security
is becoming more lax day by day, and the political status of those in power
is increasingly isolated locally and externally. President Zirwal has consumed
all the benefits he gained in the presidential elections, and the people
are no longer optimistic that he could lead the country to a general reconciliation
to stop the blood-shed. Instead, he left his generals to sink in the blood
bath until he no longer wore a political cover.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, FIS popularity has been enhanced, and its relations
with the democratic opposition strengthened. All indications point to the
fact that events are being rapidly developed in favour of the opposition
led by the FIS, which adopts a moderate approach and a political programme
which is a good grounding for national reconciliation.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Mina Fire Overshadows Hajj</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Khalid Amayreh, Palestine Times' correspondent
in the West Bank, returned home from Mecca after performing Hajj (pilgrimage).
He wrote this article upon his return to the Occupied Territories.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca this year, which reached
its climax on 15 April with the traditional &quot;Wakfa&quot; or &igrave;stop-over&icirc;
at Mount Arafat, was marred by a huge blaze that swept through the pilgrim
tent city of Mina, destroying more than 70,000 tents, killing 343 pilgrims
and injuring another 15,000 people, mostly from the Indian subcontinent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The blaze, fanned by strong easterly winds, lasted for
more than four hours before Saudi fire-fighters finally succeeded in getting
it under control. Hot desert temperatures, reaching 42 degrees centigrade,
combined with extremely congested roads in the area, seriously hindered
efforts to quickly put out the fire. Moreover, the readily flammable substance
of which the tents were made obviously accelerated the spread of the blaze.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is still unclear as to what exactly sparked the colossal
fire, but Saudi officials seemed to be sure that a faulty cooking gas canister
caused the inferno. Initially the Saudi media, tightly controlled by the
government, was laconic about the incident, repeatedly promising listeners
and viewers to give more details later. However, as the full scope of the
tragedy was becoming more apparent, Interior Minister and President of the
Supreme Hajj Committee, Prince Naif Ibn Abdul Aziz announced the &quot;unfortunate
disaster,&quot; which he rightly said could have resulted in a much greater
catastrophe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Identifying the victims proved an extremely difficult task
as many bodies were charred beyond recognition. Saudi Hajj officials, nevertheless,
made strenuous efforts to identify the nationality of the victims in cooperation
with various national pilgrim missions. On 18 April, it was announced that
among the victims were at least 150 Indians, 60 Pakistanis, in addition
to scores from other, mostly East-Asian, countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Indian official in Jeddah pointed a finger of blame
at the Saudi authorities, saying that virtually all the victims could have
been saved had the Saudis taken proper action in time. The Indian consul
said that the Saudis had erected a fence around the encampment where the
fire took place, which he said prevented the victims from fleeing the site.
According to survivors, many of the victims were trampled on by fleeing
pilgrims anxious to escape the fire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hajj drew to a final close with Tawaf al Ifada (the
final circumambulation around the Kaaba at the Grand Mosque) following the
stop-over at Arafat. Saudi authorities declared this year's Hajj clean as
no epidemics or contagious diseases were reported among the estimated 2
million pilgrims. Non-Arab Muslims featured more prominently during the
Hajj this year, with Arab pilgrims not exceeding 20 per cent of the total
number of pilgrims. As many as 170,000 Indonesians made it to Mecca this
year, with Pakistan placing second, India third, followed by Iran, Turkey
and Egypt respectively. More black Africans reportedly performed Hajj this
year than in previous years, which might reflect growing Islamic awareness
among the black continent's rising Muslim population. Moreover, King Fahd
reportedly invited 1,000 pilgrims from Chechnya to perform Hajj and a similar
number from Bosnia. More pilgrims also came from China, especially from
its troubled western, predominantly Muslim, region of Xingiang or Eastern
Turkestan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Putting the tragic Mina blaze aside, the Hajj season went
generally smoothly, with the Saudi authorities offering nearly excellent
services to the pilgrims. State-of-the-art services and accommodations ranged
from air-conditioned marble pavement to computerized billboards featuring
prayer times and were everywhere at and around the two spacious Grand Mosques
in Mecca and Medina. Cold water was available round-the-clock through ubiquitous
fountains at the two sanctuaries. Furthermore, there was no shortage of
food throughout the pilgrimage term, although a slight rise in prices was
noted due to intensified demand. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Golden Fledgling</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>(Part 2)</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: E. Yaghi</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bursting through the door, the leader snarled, &quot;Where
is the boy? Tell us at once! We know he came in here. We have witnesses.
If you don't tell us, we&iacute;ll kill you!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Panic-stricken by now, the old woman denied any knowledge
of a boy entering her home. &quot;Search the house!&quot; hissed the stocky
leader. She cringed in fear as the police rummaged through and broke her
few worldly possessions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Please,&quot; begged Sarah, &quot;Please leave me
alone. I know nothing of any boy!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Liars,&quot; yelled the leader. &quot;You are all
liars!&quot; As he shouted, one of his men forced open the cellar door.
The boy crouched in horror at his foreseeable discovery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At first the policemen did not see the boy and then as
his eyes strained in the unaccustomed dark, he saw Haitham trying to make
himself invisible in a corner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Here he is!&quot; the policeman shouted as he ripped
the boy out of the cellar with one forcible swing of his arm. &quot;This
is one of the brats that was throwing stones!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The five policemen all wrenched the boy from one another
and began mercilessly beating him with their thick clubs. The young boy
screamed with pain and horror as his blood gushed out from the relentless
blows to his head and body.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sarah shrieked in anger, entreating the world and the village
to stop the inhumane beating of the boy. &quot;In God's mercy, &quot; she
cried, &quot;leave the boy alone! You are armed with weapons and clubs.
You call yourselves police yet you all chase one small boy. Tyrants!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As she spoke, blood oozed through Haitham's silky hair
and over his clothes. While she was still pleading, one of the policemen
struck her in the head with his club. She sank down praying for God's mercy,
for the safety of her sons and Haitham, and one final prayer for herself.
She died helplessly murdered in a pool of her own blood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unheeding the death of the old woman, the police grabbed
the boy, dragged him outside and threw him in their van. Inside the vehicle,
other young prisoners, also guilty of stone-throwing, wiped Haitham's face,
trying to stop the flow of blood that still gushed out of his head wounds.
He felt a blinding pain and helpless, hopeless fear. He remembered old Sarah
dying for him and felt responsible for her death. His own demise seemed
imminent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He was taken with the other captives to an underground
dungeon. Unearthly dank odors were everywhere. He could hear the screams
of prisoners being tortured. He felt meek and numb. The guards threw him
into a small cell with about 50 other boys and men.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Let's make an example out of this one,&quot; a vicious
policeman told his friend. &quot;At midnight we'll come and take the boy
out and hang him. He will be a good lesson for all stone-throwers. Freedom,
equality, bah! All of them should be killed so we can be rid of them and
take this country for ourselves!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hungry, cold and paralyzed with fear, Haitham huddled against
an older boy whose face was swollen from beating and his right arm was broken.
&quot;Hey, kid,&quot; he offered, &quot;you&iacute;ll be all right. You&iacute;re
a hero! Good for you and damn the Occupation! The world is deaf to our torment
and torture. If the mountains, hills and rivers of our country could talk
as witnesses to our agony, they would scream in mortification for all our
suffering! Long live freedom, democracy and our country! Our women and children
fight a courageous yet helpless fight. Quiet, my boy, you are here with
us!&quot; But Haitham wondered who his mate was trying to convince to be
brave.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At midnight, two policemen came and forced Haitham out
of his cell. The other prisoners demanded that the police leave the boy
alone and let him go home to his family, but the police only clubbed the
resisting cell-mates while the other raised his gun on them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The world lay sleeping as one small, frightened boy was
forced into the police car and taken outside the village. As it approached
an ancient olive tree, the car silently crept to a halt. The police grabbed
a thick rough rope from the back seat of the vehicle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Please, what are you going to do to me? Please let
me go home!&quot; pleaded Haitham. By now, his blood had matted his hair
and thickened to a crust. He saw the bulky, snake-like rope with the same
policeman who had heartlessly struck down the old woman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Here, boy, we are going to make you an example for
all stone-throwers and revolutionists. May you all perish and be damned,&quot;
growled one of the murderers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reaching deep into his small body, the young 'Golden Eagle'
drew up the strength of a man and cried out, &quot;No, may you be damned
for injustice, for murder, for not letting a boy be just a boy. Our only
weapons are stones. If you kill me, I shall die a martyr, but you shall
go to Hell! My blood will be on your hands and you won't be able to wash
it off! Long live Palestine! Down with Occupation!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With this last sentence, the murderers tied a noose around
the neck of the deserted innocent boy, a boy who in any other country would
have been playing with his friends, not fighting for liberty. The two policemen,
contradicting their own uniforms, roughly strung the fledgling up in the
tree. He kicked and yelled, fighting the rope that choked the life out of
him until his neck snapped.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The evil deed done, the two criminals slunk to their car
and returned to their own homes and children, not once thinking of the young
eagle left to die alone while the world slept its dreary lazy sleep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the morning, Haitham's small dead body was carried to
his home. His little brothers cried in dismay at his death. His mother gave
one long, piercing scream and then fainted. The neighbours, some with their
own husbands and sons in prison or dead, came to comfort her. Only one of
many small lives was snuffed out as if it were only a candle flame. Another
life joined the list of the unending and seemingly hopeless cause of liberty
and freedom. Meanwhile, around the world, most people woke to a new day
to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee, and to pursue a leisurely, carefree or
busy morning, completely unaware of the suffering and pain of those in a
less fortunate state of being than themselves.</FONT></P>
