<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>The Whole Western World Against Sudan! Why?
</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Randa Awadh</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>	</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>When one reviews twentieth-century
Sudan, one sees a poor, backwards, weak and shattered state, always run
by others.  Despite its rich natural resources, it still has not managed
over the past 100 years to establish a solid economy or to build an economically
independent state which would not be in need of the mercy of the World Bank
and could avoid the interference of industrialized countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Since al Basheer&iacute;s government came to power, things
started to change and reform policies emerged.  It started by choosing free,
strong-willed, independently spirited men and women, proud of their heritage
and religion and unaffected by foreign influences to run the country and
to make use of its resources in order to establish an independent economy
and to lead the nation into the twenty-first century, strong and capable
of facing the world. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It was unfortunate for Sudan that it was in the way of
the Zionist&iacute;s plans for the African continent contained in a master
plan with multiple targets to achieve. Some of these targets are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	1.	To control the Nile&iacute;s resources and mid-Africa&iacute;s
natural resources;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	2.	To control the countries surrounding Egypt.  Egypt
is a major Muslim country, considered to be a leader in the Arab world.
 Despite the fact that it was the first country to sign a peace agreement
with Israel, it is evident to all what the real Egyptians feel in their
hearts; they are from a Muslim nation that rejects Israel&iacute;s occupation
of Palestine, including Muslim and Christian holy places in the West Bank.
 Deep down they disagree with the peace agreement signed with Israel.  It
is inevitable that one day Egypt will be led by its true representatives
who will not be pawns for Israel.  To prepare for that day, Israel is planning
to create a &igrave;vice grip&icirc; around Egypt by controlling the Nile&iacute;s
resources.  And having isolated Egypt, the planting of pro-Israeli governments
in the neighbouring countries will take place, if it hasn&iacute;t begun
already. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	3.	To undermine Muslim power in mid-Africa.  Their plan
is to weaken the Muslim presence in mid-Africa by creating civil wars, such
as that in Rwanda, and stirring up trouble among tribes, such as in Zaire.
 Amid the resulting chaos, Israel aims to establish a solid foothold in
the area and to gain control of the natural resources, including the Nile,
thus threatening the Church&iacute;s interests in the area.  Controlling
these areas will separate Muslims in the south from those in the north,
thereby preventing any future coalition among Muslims.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It seems that this plan has been under way for a long
period,  but Sudan, with its present regime, proved to be aware of that
plan.  All Zionist efforts through political pressures and economic sanctions
did not succeed in controlling Sudan.  On the contrary, it seemed to strengthen
the government and helped in uniting the Sudanese people.  As a result,
stronger measures were taken through neighbouring countries.  Initially
the southern war was mounted by providing Garang and all the factions which
followed him with supplies of weapons, ammunition, money and the expertise
of the Western propaganda to give a legitimate right to the war, but that
did not prove effective in deterring or breaking the Sudanese government,
so other neighbouring countries were drawn into attacking Sudan with military
support from the West on the one hand and direct guidance, involvement in
planning and even executing attacks by Israeli army officers and their intelligence
service on the other. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	By God&iacute;s guidance and the wisdom of Sudan&iacute;s
leaders, Sudan managed to revoke all major attacks and to make peace agreements
with many opposing factions, which was considered to be a huge blow to Garang
and his followers.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Albania and the undermining of Islamic presence
in Balkan</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Nabeel Shabib</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>	</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>The recent incidents in Albania were
seen as a mere eruption of spontaneous rebellion by people who were frustrated
because they lost their life savings after the collapse of fraudulent financial
companies in which their savings were invested.  This is exactly what happened
but observers did not explain the consequences of these incidents nor did
they put them in their historic framework, especially in the short period
after the collapse of Communism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Developments in Albania should be seen as another chapter
of the Balkan scene which aims to limit and undermine the Islamic presence
there.  The Communist regimes in the area failed to efface the dogmatic
and historic essence of more than 12 million Muslims of different European
races living in Balkan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Muslim Albanians constitute more than half of the
Balkan Muslims.  But for political reasons and to be contained, they were
distributed over a vast area and became minorities in their original homelands,
as in Maqadonia where they constitute more than 40 per cent of the population
(although the authorities say there are only 22-30 per cent) and in Kusovo
of former Yugoslavia where they form more than 95 per cent of the population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Muslim Albanians in Albania itself constitute more
than 90 per cent of the population.  The Western estimations put them at
only 50-70 per cent.  This reminds us of the Western reports during the
Communist era which estimated the Muslims in the former Yugoslavia at less
than 1.5 million but in fact there were about 6 million Muslims after the
collapse of that country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Albania has been a target for the ambitions of the regional
powers.  The Serbs who control Kusovo have ambitions in the northern part
of Albania.  Greeks also have ambitions to annex the southern part of that
country by instigating an Orthodox minority living there.  Athens did not
raise the 'rights' of this minority during the Communist era, but it began
doing so after the collapse of the Communists; it has also been enhancing
the missionary activities among Muslims in the area since that time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The armed insurrection that broke out in Albania last
February was a spontaneous result of the Western policies and local events.
 Albania was the only European Communist country of which the Western governments
repatriated its immigrants instead of using the Albanians to pressure the
Communist regime at the time.  The West did not show any sign of cooperation
or financial support to Albania although the Communists sought such cooperation
to reduce pressure on them.  The Western governments wanted the Communist
regime in Albania to continue until a pro-West political party was created
in that country.  They feared the emergence of an Islamic power in a country
that was described as the only Muslim country in Europe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The West searched for a power to adopt the Western capitalist
perspectives and finally they had the Democratic Party, led by the present
President of Albania Sali (Saleh) Berisha.  Mr. Berisha was a Communist
until the collapse of Communism.  The Westerners also activated the missionaries
which were the only organizations that provided the poor people of Albania
with financial aid.  They also entered into that country through the traditional
means of corruption:  narcotics and pornography.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The missionary and corruption campaigns were well-planned
and preceded attempts to establish 'democratic' and economic structures
in Albania.  The West wanted a base in that country which eventually connected
with the Western morals that contradicted Islam, the religion of the overwhelming
majority of Albanians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The direct contacts between Mr. Berisha and his party
on the one hand, and the support he received from the West, particularly
the United States of America and Germany, on the other, transformed him
from an unknown Communist activist to leader of a party that carried the
title of the Western 'democracy' and adopts the extremist capitalistic ideologies.
 He achieved a marginal success in the first presidential elections and
did not hesitate to suppress his rivals in the May 1996 elections, which
prevented them from running for the elections.  He forged the results in
order to remain in power.  His party governs the country in the same autocratic
manner of the Communist regimes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	President Berisha supported the fraudulent investment
companies which mainly depended on arms trading in Bosnia and were involved
in drug trading and laundering money.  The government continued its support
of these usurious companies despite warnings of being close to bankruptcy.
 They began declaring themselves bankrupt and people who invested their
life savings in these companies lost them and were left out in the streets.
 Tirana's policies did not change.  The Western countries did not pressure
the Albanian government to interfere nor did they link loans they granted
to Albania with making economic reforms as they do with certain other countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This Western attitude towards Albania had no reasonable
meaning except a reality that they wanted Albania to collapse as a state
in order to divide it into smaller parts to be annexed to its neighbouring
countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	What is going on in Albania with a shameful absence of
the Islamic governments in that part of the world drives the Western governments
to show themselves as the friends who came to rescue that country.  Their
intervention in Albania will never serve the religious, historic or cultural
interests of its Muslim people, nor will it maintain the Islamic presence
in the Balkan region in general.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The recent developments in Albania complete what the Western
powers achieved in Bosnia but with some formal differences.  In Bosnia,
there was a need to encourage wars between the Muslim Bosnians, Croats and
Serbs in order to destroy a country that began to have a strong growing
economy led by Muslims.  When the economic structure of Bosnia was completely
destroyed and its land was divided into several small entities and cantons,
the Western governments showed themselves as friends who came to the rescue
while in reality they came to dominate the internal construction of these
entities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In Albania there was no infrastructure to be destroyed
externally as was the case with Bosnia. Instead, the destruction came from
inside by the autocratic regime of Berisha, the collapse of the fraudulent
investment companies and by spreading corruption and sending missionaries.
 This created a political vacuum in Albania and, again, the Westerners came
to fill it by playing the role of the 'rescuer'.</FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel's Interests in Turkey</FONT></H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Randa Awadh</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>	</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>The Turkish Prime Minister Erbakan
is striving to improve the economic situation in Turkey by turning it into
an economically and politically independent state.  The policies he is implementing
are: establishing long-term trade deals with neighbouring countries, such
as Iran and Iraq; opening trade channels with the Islamic republics (the
former Soviet Union); as well as trying to form an Islamic economic bloc
comprising East Asian, Middle Eastern and North African countries.  The
Prime Minister is also concentrating on the home-front by increasing the
people&iacute;s national and religious awareness in order to reduce the
impact of Western culture on Turkish thinking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	These policies and measures are not approved of by the
army generals because such a trend will minimize their role in the government
and limit their interests.  This trend will also not be approved of by Western
governments, especially the United States, because it will affect its influence
and authority over the second-most largest army in NATO.  It will also harm
and drastically affect Israel&iacute;s interests and plans in the area for
the future.  Thus Israel, backed by America, is fighting Erbakan&iacute;s
policies directly through the Turkish army generals and indirectly through
its Jewish and Turkish agents inside Turkey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israel and America stand to lose much if Turkey achieves
political and economic independence because:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	1.	Both Turkey and Israel have vital and important relations
with Syria. Usually Israel makes its deals with Arab countries only when
they are stuck in a corner.  Thus Israel wants to weaken Syria, which is
still strong, by applying pressure.  Turkey also has its own interests in
Syria which include controlling the Euphrates and finishing off the Kurdish
rebels. Losing Turkey&iacute;s support would therefore reduce the pressure
on Syria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	2.	Northern Iraq  is vital for both Israel and Turkey.
 Israel is interested in helping the Iraqi Kurds because a large group of
Jewish Kurds in Northern Iraq, who were forced to move to Israel in 1948,
thus causing them to hate the ruling government of Iraq, would like to be
reunited with their kin.  At a higher level, both Israel and the U.S. are
worried about the possibility of Iraq forming a powerful force because of
its abundant natural resources, which could tip the balance of power in
the area.  On the other hand, Turkey is still interested in reclaiming al
Mousel and Karkouk in Northern Iraq (both were previously Turkish provinces).
 Such a step would relieve Israel because Northern Iraq is rich in oil and
water resources.  This explains America&iacute;s insistence on not lifting
the sanctions placed on Iraq; it is to ensure Iraq&iacute;s breakdown while
decreasing the danger it poses to Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	3.	Iran also poses a threat to both Turkey and Israel.
 The American-Israeli support to the Turkish army helps Turkey to have the
upper hand always in any political strife.  And the freedom given to the
Israeli air force to use Turkish airports and air bases gives Israel the
opportunity of reaching targets deep in Iran which would have been otherwise
inaccessible from Palestine.  Such privileges will be denied to Israel in
the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	4.	Israel has realized the potential of the Islamic republics
(the former Soviet Union).  They are rich in oil minerals and agriculture.
 However, they are weak because of their newly won independence and their
political quarreling.  In the hope of influencing them, Israel has made
huge efforts to build relationships with these states to the extent that
the number of Jewish missions and institutions exceeds those of all the
Arab countries put together.  Turkey as well is trying to spread its national
and cultural identity in the area.  In addition the area is a dump-site
for all the excess arms produced during the cold war.  So both Israel and
Turkey would have strong allies, which to America is important, in case
Russia resumes its previous power.  Also by creating this block between
the Middle East and Europe, America has the upper hand and can stop any
cooperation between united Europe and the Arab/Islamic world.  These advantages
will all be lost to America if Turkey follows the path it has chosen.<BR>
