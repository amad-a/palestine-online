<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Collaboration with Zionists Arafat's only
means of survival</FONT></H3>

<P>	<FONT SIZE=+1>Last month Arafat's self-rule authority revealed its ugly
face when leaders of the PA security services proved collaboration with
the Israeli occupation authorities which in turn led to the arrest of a
striking Hamas military cell said to be responsible for numerous attacks
on the Zionist occupation soldiers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In his battle to survive, Chairman Arafat has given in
to the Israeli security dictation, making his Authority an instrument in
the hands of the Israeli Shin Bet security service.  The PA senior officials
claim they have suspended security cooperation with the Israelis following
the decision made by the Israeli government to proceed with the construction
of the new Jewish settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in occupied East Jerusalem.
In fact, this &quot;collaboration&quot; has not stopped given the simple
fact that it is the only means of survival for Chairman Arafat and his men
(labeled by the Gazans as the &quot;Tunisians&quot;) who returned with Mr.
Arafat to the homeland after having spent 11 years in Tunisia.  The Israelis,
who suspended the final status negotiations with the PLO, kept the door
wide open for security cooperation with the PA's security leaders who promised
to suppress the Palestinian popular intifada and to destroy the infrastructures
of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad; a task in which the Zionists have failed
to achieve over the years of occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Has Chairman Yasser Arafat become the vassal of the Israeli
state?  Have the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza merely seen
an exchange of harsh and cruel regimes?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Professor Edward Said, the renowned Arab/American thinker,
has repeatedly used the word &quot;collaborator&quot; to portray Yasser
Arafat.  Dr. Nasser Aruri, a Professor of Political Science at Southeastern
Massachusetts University, publicly described the Palestinian President as
a &quot;vassal.&quot;  Dr. Haidar Abdul Shafi, former head of the Palestinian
negotiating team at Madrid and in Washington, has denounced the Palestine
Authority as a &quot;terrible disaster&quot; for the Palestinian people.
 He said that the PA was created with American and Israeli arms and money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Despair and fear of the PA continue to grow in the doubly
occupied territories.  Journalists and newspapers have been intimidated
by the PA and there is now a new form of oppression for the Palestinian
people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Many Hamas leaders and members have been imprisoned by
the PA instead of Shin Bet, and it is no secret that brutal methods of torture
have been used to extract information from these prisoners and that Palestinians
have died as a result at the hands of their PA interrogators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A Gazan merchant summarized to Mr. David Hirst of the
British Guardian his people's misery after the coming of Mr. Arafat's retired
'resistants'.  He said, &quot;We live in amazing, shameful times, but you
should know that every revolution has its fighters, thinkers and profiteers.
 Our fighters have been killed, our thinkers assassinated, and all we have
left are the profiteers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Mr. Arafat has proved great commitment to the secret provisions
of the Oslo Accords regarding the security &quot;collaboration&quot; with
the Israelis and that the parties on which he now completely depends&oacute;Israelis
and Americans&oacute;are willing to ignore, even encourage, his manifest
corruption, as the British journalist recorded. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Arafat has come to light as not only an oppressor but
a dictator and tyrant as well.  He also has complete control over the budget
and finances.  Furthermore, after the signing of the Peace Accords in Oslo
in 1994,  the living conditions of average Palestinians have sharply deteriorated
since the coming of the PA to the so-called self-rule areas.  There are
the closures of the two huge concentration camps of the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank, the continued building of settlements, and complete control of
all aspects of Palestinian economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israeli reports revealed that Chairman Arafat has a secret
account of more than $150 million in the Israeli Leumi Bank in Tel Aviv.
 These funds, which Mr. Arafat uses to buy off his rivals, are the taxes
collected by the PA from the poor Palestinians which only adds to their
suffering.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is all too clear that Arafat's services have been bought
and that he now serves the interests of the Israeli government.  For the
Palestinian population, the oppression continues; it is merely an exchange
of oppressors in the now doubly occupied territories<BR>
