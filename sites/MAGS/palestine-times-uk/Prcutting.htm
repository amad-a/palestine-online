<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Pentagon's stealthy purchase of 21 advanced MIG-29
fighter jets from  the downsizing military establishment of Moldova, disclosed
last week,  was an ingenious, cut-rate method for protecting the national
security. Depriving Iran of Moldova's MIG-29s may be defined as addition
by  subtraction. Subtracting from Iran's arsenal this means of delivering
 nuclear weapons adds to the security of all the countries around the  Persian
Gulf as well as Turkey, Pakistan, and Israel. Buying the best of Moldova's
decommissioned air force is less  complicated and less risky than having
to take some preemptive military  action against Tehran a few years from
now. To cope with the  proliferation challenge that has become the primary
threat to US  security, the Pentagon has invested in the proverbial ounce
of  prevention.  <B>From the editorial of The Boston Globe, November 10,

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A PALESTINIAN informer who unwittingly delivered a booby-trapped
mobile telephone which killed the notorious Hamas bomber &quot;the Engineer&quot;
is suing Israel's Shin Bet security service for 15 million compensation.
Kamal Hamad, a contractor from Gaza, claims he is owed the money because
of the financial losses the murder of Yahya Ayyash has caused him and the
ever-present threat to his own life. The law suit, the biggest against the
Shin Bet, has been filed in a Tel Aviv court and follows fruitless negotiations
between the two sides since Ayyash was blown apart by the rigged cellular
phone in January 1996. <B>The Guardian,  November 11, 1997.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>HENRY KISSINGER the former American Secretary of State,
said yesterday it is time for Israel to realise that a Palestinian state
is inevitable. His declaration came in a memorial lecture to mark the second
anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour Prime Minister.
Dr Kissinger told a packed auditorium in Tel Aviv: &quot;The big decision
has to be made. One cannot possibly hope there is a way around it.&quot;
He said that while he had advocated a gradual, &quot;step-by-step process&quot;
to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, he now believed it was time for giant
strides. <B>The Times, Tuesday, November 11, 1997.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The conflicting reports about Arafat's health have created
even more  concern than usual about the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
 negotiations and raised fears of a struggle for succession. Talk of Arafat's
physical vulnerability has promoted jockeying among  people hoping to inherit
power in the Palestinian Authority, which rules  parts of the Gaza Strip
and West Bank, Palestinian analysts said. The  authority's democratic structures
remain embryonic, and some  Palestinians have voiced concern that a post-Arafat
power struggle would  involve a trial of strength among the heads of several
Palestinian  police and intelligence agencies. <B>The Washington Post, November
15, 1997.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fifty years after the war that established Israel and forced
many  Palestinians off their lands into refugee camps or exile, Palestinians
 almost instinctively support anyone who will oppose Israel, said Haidar
 Abdul Shafi, a prominent Gaza politician and former Palestinian chief 
negotiator with the Israelis. Unfortunately but unavoidably, he said,  &quot;the
Palestinian masses reacted from their own deep sense of injustice,  to the
point of hailing the missiles falling on Israelis&quot; in 1991. Raed Habet,
a man in his twenties who cradled his infant son last week  in the Gaza
Strip's Shati refugee camp, said Palestinians' frustrations  have grown
with this year's breakdown of the peace process that once  offered hope
for a Palestinian homeland. &quot;We are driven by our emotions  over what
we have lost,&quot; Habet said. &quot; <B>The Washington Post, November
17, 1997.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Middle East conference intended to encourage peace and
economic  prosperity ended Tuesday with calls for Israel to respect its
agreements  with the Palestinians and move toward lasting peace. Most Arab
states boycotted the three-day conference to protest the  policies of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom they blame  for the current impasse
in the peace process. The six to participate  voiced strong support for
the Palestinians, who did not send a  delegation. &quot;There is no future
for cooperation, development and stability if we do  not protect the peace
process from collapse and unite in our efforts to  force Israel to make
good on its commitments,&quot; said Tunisia's foreign  affairs minister,
Alsadeq Abalahu, at the closing session. <B>The Chicago Tribune,  November
19, 1997.<BR>
