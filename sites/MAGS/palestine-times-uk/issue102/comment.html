<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deportation by the Jordanian government on 21 November of four Hamas
leaders (Khalid Misha&#146;al, Ibrahim Ghoshe, Izzat Resheq and Sami Khater), who are all
Jordanian citizens, is undoubtedly an indelible stigma that will continue to stigmatize
the Jordanian government for many years to come. Thanks to the unlawful and draconian
measure, Jordan will be remembered as probably the first country whose
&#147;government&#148; expelled its own citizens to a second country in order to appease
and please a third country. Indeed, no other country, no other government that is worth
the name, ever resorted to deporting its own citizens in order to please another country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The infinitely disgraceful act is another infamy, added to the many
infamies already dotting the collective political Arab polity. It is no secret that Arab
regimes treat their own citizens as mere &#147;subjects&#148; rather than
&#147;citizens&#148; with constitutional, political and human rights. The government of
Abdel Rauf al-Rawabdeh, by expelling Jordanian citizens to a distant, though nominally
&#147;brotherly&#148; land, left no doubt as to the contempt with which it views and
treats its citizenry. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deportation, an act often equated with death in Islamic traditions, is
a naked, brash and scandalous act that is inherently immoral and intrinsically illegal by
all measures and standards.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Expelling citizens from their own country, irrespective of any conceivable
circumstances, can thus be considered a criminal act of grave proportions, and the fact
that it was perpetrated by a &#147;national government&#148; makes it even more appalling.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Governments may prosecute offending citizens, imprison them, even hang
them if they commit a given crime; but no respectable government on the face of earth,
probably except the Zionist regime, resorts to expelling its own citizens (blindfolded and
handcuffed) in the middle of the night.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, in any case, the deportees are actually not offenders of any kind.
More so, they are not just ordinary citizens. The four leaders deported represent the <i>cr�me
de la cr�me</i> of contemporary Arab societies. They are the last-remaining (and
hopefully enduring) symbols of Arab-Muslim pride by virtually insisting on standing aloft
for Arab rights in Palestine while the rest hastened to raise the white flag, in utter
disgrace, in the face of American-Zionist hegemony and insolence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deportation to Qatar was Abel Rauf al-Rawabdeh&#146;s way of rewarding
Khalid Misha&#146;al for defying and defeating the Mossad in the streets of Amman, the
only Arab capital where the Mossad felt (and still feels) it has <i>carte blanche</i> to
move and act against patriotic Palestinians and Jordanians who still dare say
&#147;no&#148; to the Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the Jordanian government did Israel&#146;s bidding. That
should explain it all.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, there is always no shortage of the kind of &#147;rubbish
talk&#148; that is parroted by irate officials of Rawabdeh&#146;s government who seek
nervously to turn the big lie into a &#147;truth&#148;, all in a desperate effort to cover
their shameful act against Hamas leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, in their frivolous quest to explain their shameful act to a
no-longer beguiled audience, Rawabdeh and his government have sought to concoct
&#147;justifications&#148; for deporting the four Islamists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is amply clear that any respectable observer can&#146;t help
seeing and feeling the baselessness of these justifications, so much so that seeking to
refute them would only lend them the dignity and seriousness they so conspicuously lack.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, in addition to practicing arbitrary measures against its own people
and violating the constitution which so obviously prohibits the deportation of citizens
under any circumstances, the Rawabdeh government resorts to misleading the public opinion
in order to justify its folly against its own citizens.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All this should serve to bring an end to this government, having adopted a
<i>modus operandi</i> of deception <i>vis-�-vis</i> its own citizens. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for Hamas, it is indispensable that the Movement must pay the price for
refusing adamantly to raise the white flag before Israel and the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, in doing this, Hamas will command the respect, admiration and
support of Jordanians, Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims everywhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this is, after all, Hamas&#146;s bidding and with that, victory
will some day come, God willing.</p>
