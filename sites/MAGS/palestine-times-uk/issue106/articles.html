<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Taiba&#146;s bloody Thursday</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 2 March, four Islamist guerrillas, belonging to the military wing of
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and who were apparently on their way to carry out
attacks inside 1948-Palestine, were martyred in an unqualified confrontation with hundreds
of Zionist troops.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A fifth member of the Islamist guerrilla cell was captured in
still-ambiguous circumstances, while the sixth member fled to the West Bank town of
Tulkarm, where he, too, was eventually captured by Palestinian Authority police.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloody episode began Wednesday night, 1 March, when Israel&#146;s
chief domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, received information that a number of
Hamas guerrillas rented an apartment in the Israeli-Palestinian town of Taiba, north-east
of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Immediately, the peaceable town was put under curfew (reminiscent of the
Israeli military rule to which the Arab minority was subjected in the 1950s and early
1960s), and hundreds of Israeli soldiers and snipers were deployed around the building
inside which the guerrillas barricaded themselves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli sources claimed one guerrilla fired (or sought to fire) a pistol
at the overwhelming Israeli force, and that a bag packed with explosives carried by a
second guerrilla exploded during the &#147;exchange of fire(!!)&#148; killing them both
and slightly wounding an Israeli policeman in the foot.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few hours later, a robot with mounted video camera and a remote-operated
rifle was sent in to the ground-floor flat in search of any remaining guerrillas, but the
search was in vain. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then came the grisliest part of the operation when a huge army bulldozer
moved to demolish the building, crushing whoever was inside. One remaining guerrilla,
whose hands protruded from amidst the rubble, was &#147;finished off&#148;&#151;using the
words of an Israeli army radio correspondent. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fourth guerrilla was apparently buried alive, and later was shot
several times in the head to verify that he was dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli security and political officials, while congratulating themselves
on the grand achievement at Taiba, admitted, nonetheless, that the &#147;liquidation of
the terrorist cell&#148; was no guarantee that further attempts or successful attacks by
Palestinian Islamic guerrillas would not take place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;In our estimation, people connected to the same squad have the
capability of carrying out a terrorist attack,&#148; said the Israeli police inspector,
General Yehuda Wilk.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that, &#147;I believe Hamas will continue to try to carry out
attacks at one level or another. There are people who are prepared to carry out suicide
attacks, and there is a capability to manufacture explosive devices, and the combination
of the two constitutes the potential for a terrorist attack.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Underscoring these fears, Israel, on 5 March, placed its security forces
on high alert to forestall possible attacks by Hamas, and roadblocks were set up on main
routes and on entrances to main towns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The alert remained in effect, despite the fact that the cell&#146;s sixth
member was arrested by PA security forces in Tukarm and the fact that a bomb factory was
discovered in the town on 5 May that allegedly was used to provide the six would-be
suicidal bombers with the explosives needed for their mission.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The state of alert was ended only after the Eid ul-Adha holiday when the
two remaining members of the cell were arrested by the PA Preventive Security Force
reportedly based on information provided by Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Israeli officials, particularly the heads of Shin Bet, made no
secret of their deep satisfaction with the &#147;closer-than-usual coordination&#148; with
the PA security and intelligence apparatus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, even PA security officials themselves brazenly admitted that
security cooperation between the two sides during and after the Taiba episode was creating
a good &#147;political&#148; atmosphere between the two sides. The Israeli paper, the <i>Jerusalem
Post</i>, on 6 March quoted an unidentified high-ranking security official as saying that,
&#147;We have made it very clear to our security people that they must continue to
cooperate with Israel on the security level, whatever the political situation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, in addition to arresting the sixth member of the guerrilla cell
and to discovering the bomb factory in Tulkarm, the PA also arrested two guards of Hamas
founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin on suspicion that they were connected with the cell.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obviously, this was music to Israeli government officials&#146; ears,
including Foreign Minister David Levy, who only a few days earlier vowed to incinerate
Lebanon and kill Lebanese children if Hizbullah attacked northern Israeli settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Seeking to pay back the gratitude for their earnest security cooperation,
Levy suggested that Israel adopt a series of &#147;confidence-building measures&#148; to
encourage the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These, he said, would include freeing some Palestinian prisoners as a
gesture of goodwill on the eve of the Eid ul-Adha holiday and displaying more generosity
in &#147;economic matters.&#148; </p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><u><strong><font size="3">Military operations planned against
soldiers, not civilians</font></strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Israeli Hebrew newspaper, <i>Ma&#146;ariv</i> (5 March),
the six-man Gazan cell was planning to carry out simultaneous suicide-bombing operations
against Israeli soldiers, not civilians, as was earlier suggested by some Israeli
officials. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The paper said the guerrillas were planning to carry out spectacular
operations similar to the 1995-Bit Lid suicidal bombing in which over 20 Israeli soldiers
were killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If true, the information, which was apparently obtained from the captured
guerrilla, gives credence to the Hamas decision last year to refrain from attacking
Israeli civilians, particularly suicidal bomb attacks in Israeli urban centres.</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><u><strong><font size="3">Resumption of Hamas armed resistance</font></strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest events seem to indicate that Hamas has decided to resume its
armed resistance against Israel, and the movement&#146;s fiasco at Taiba is unlikely to
have a long-lasting effect on the implementation of that decision.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the rampant collective Palestinian frustration throughout the
self-rule enclaves, which is engulfing Islamists and non-Islamists alike, and the growing
despair concerning the prospects of the peace process, given continued Israeli
equivocation and procrastination, are fostering an incendiary atmosphere which makes the
renewal of armed attacks (including suicidal bombings) against Israel not only expected
but also welcomed by the majority of Palestinians.</p>

spokesman in Hebron</font></b></p>
<b>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Authority is our oppressor, but our
conflict is with Israel</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><em><strong>Abdul Khaleq al-Natshe was born in 1954 into a prominent
Hebronite family. After he finished high school in Hebron, he went to Saudi Arabia where
he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Islamic University at Medina. For the last 10
years, Natshe has been an on-again/off-again prisoner in both Israeli and Palestinian
Authority jails. Last week, Natshe spoke to the Palestine Times. Here are excerpts of what
he said.</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Question:</strong> Your activism within the Islamic movement has
caused you lots of difficulties. Do you regret having selected the Islamic line?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Answer:</strong> You are right. This is not an easy path, and
walking on it invites difficulties and hardships. In 1984, I was arrested by the Israeli
occupation authorities, along with a number of my colleagues who graduated from the
Islamic University at Medina. The interrogation then centred on our Islamic activities in
Saudi Arabia . And since then, I've been barred from leaving the country.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Were you arrested again?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Yes. I was given an extra-judicial imprisonment for
six months in 1988, and four more months in 1989; then in 1990, I was imprisoned for an
entire year on charges of belonging to Hamas. In 1991, I was among the 400 Palestinian
Islamists deported to Marj al-Zuhur in South Lebanon, and upon my return, I was arrested
for two weeks. In 1996, I was imprisoned again, this time for two years, and the charge
was my participation in the dialogue talks between Hamas and the PA. All in all, I could
say I have entered all Israeli jails.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> And how do you look back at all of this?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> I am quite satisfied, because all our sacrifices were
for the sake of our faith and in defence of our rights and land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> But between you and yourself, don't you feel that you
suffered too much?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> No, I know well the risks and hazards inherent on this
road.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> You are referred to as the official spokesman of the
Islamic Movement in Hebron; aren't you concerned about the possible risks as a result of
this?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> I am aware that the Zionists follow my movement, but
this is our way, and we will continue what we are doing because this is the right way.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Do you feel secure in area (A)?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>More or less, yes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> We hear about Hamas and the Muslim Brothers&#133;are
they the same?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>The name is not very important. We are Muslim
activists intent on the reinstitution of the political authority of Islam. The Brothers
created the Islamic movement in Egypt. They were the main body. And then Hamas appeared,
an indigenous Palestinian plant, but in the final analysis, we are the Muslim Brothers'
strong arm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Is the Muslim Brotherhood an asset or a liability for
you?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> We are quite proud to be associated with them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Does Hamas have a say in the Shura Council of the
Worldwide Muslim Brothers?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> These are administrative arrangements, otherwise there
is administrative independence in each area. But ultimately we are inextricably entwined
because our goal is the same.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Is their coordination between Hamas and other Muslim
movements?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> There is a modicum of coordination, but not at the
decision-making level.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q. </strong>Doesn't this vindicate the PA charges that Hamas acts
at the beck and call of foreign powers?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> These are false allegations. The PLO itself has
contacts with the outside. We have to remember that an important part of our people are in
the Diaspora.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Is Hamas Palestinian first, or Islamic first?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> According to Hamas's charter, Hamas is a Palestinian
liberation movement based on Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q. </strong>How could a Palestinian citizen join Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> He can find the way, I am sure about that.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Some say Hamas has stopped recruiting members and
mainly depends on popular support?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Hamas is an Islamic movement with its own peculiar
organizational apparatus; anything without organization is doomed to failure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Can a Japanese Muslim join Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Hamas welcomes any Muslim wishing to work for the
Palestinian Cause. We would also welcome a Christian if he accepted the Charter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Many think that the Islamists' entry into the struggle
was late, is this true?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> This is nonsense. In fact the Islamic movement entered
the struggle before the nationalists. We all know the heroic struggle of the Ikhwan in
Palestine in 1948 and how the bankrupt regimes responded to that heroism by arresting the
Mujahideen. Indeed, the assassination of Imam Hasan al-Banna was a reprisal against his
declaration of Jihad against the Zionists and the British.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Why did you decide to join the intifadah?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> We are those who triggered the intifadah, and if you
carefully examine the pre-intifadah period, you will find that there were Islamist
fighting cells: one headed by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. We felt we had to intervene and do
something because the Palestinian situation was deteriorating rapidly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> But don't you feel that the intifadah eventually led
to this Oslo situation?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Maybe.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Do you regret the intifadah?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> We can never regret our jihad against the occupiers of
our homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Who are the leaders of the Islamic movement in
Palestine?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> They are prominent Muslim politicians, but I don't
know who they are, I don't know them since this is a secret matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> How are the leaders chosen in Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>Through the institutions of the movement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Is there a real separation between Hamas' political
and military wings?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Yes, there is a very real separation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> From time to time, we hear about Hamas of the inside
and Hamas of the outside; is there such a thing?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> This is largely a concocted matter. Hamas is one with
members inside and outside the homeland, just like the PLO was before the establishment of
the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q. </strong>Does Hamas have a presence in Lebanon?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>Yes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> How do you control the movements' financial
operations?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> There are internal bylaws and regulations, and there
are certain punishments for violators , such as dismissal and freezing of membership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Do you support killing Palestinians who act as
informers for Israel?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Each case is examined on its merits. There can be no
generalization here.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Was Talal Sider dismissed from Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> You have to make a distinction between dismissing
somebody from Hamas and banishing him from the ranks of Islam. Sider is still a Muslim
brother.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> How do you view him and others like him?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>They are members of the PA, that is enough.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Can they return to Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> I don't think they will want to, but in case they
opted to, the institutions of the movement would decide.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> How would you describe your relations with other
Islamic movements, such as Hizbul Tahrir (the Islamic Liberation Party)?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>We deeply respect other Islamic movements, since we
believe our way is one and our enemy is one and our goal is one.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> And your relations with the Authority?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A. </strong>The Authority is our oppressor, but again we don't
like to accentuate this too much, since our conflict is with Israel. Hamas is the ultimate
safety valve that prevents the Palestinian society from sliding into a civil war.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> How many Hamas' activists are currently imprisoned in
PA custody?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> About 150.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> And in Israel?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> 60% of all Palestinian prisoners in Israel are
affiliated with Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Is Hamas popular now?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> Just look at the universities. We control most of the
student councils there.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q.</strong> Will you take part in a general election if held?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A.</strong> We will cross that bridge when we arrive there.</p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Erik Paul</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One can only admire the pilgrimage of ailing Pope John Paul II to the Holy
Land. That this person undertook such a difficult and demanding journey is incredible. One
cannot help but admire, also, the good and noble deeds of a man who has been committed to
peace and love. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an historic visit to Israel&#146;s Yad Vashem Memorial, the Pope
publicly mourned the allegedly millions of Jews killed during the Holocaust. In a solemn
voice, he stated, &#147;As Bishop of Rome and Successor of the Apostle Peter, I assure the
Jewish people that the Catholic Church...is deeply saddened by the hatred, the acts of
persecution and the displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at
any time and in my place.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jews were not the only victims of Hitler&#146;s Nazi regime. And that
millions of Jews were killed during the Holocaust is also debatable. Many European Jews
fled from fear of persecution and later returned to their homes after the Second World War
was over. The Pope is not responsible for what Hitler did just as the Palestinian people
are not responsible either and they should not have to be the new victims of the
&#147;Israeli Holocaust&#148; being waged on them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not just, civilized or rational that a people who had nothing to do
with the persecution of Jews in Europe during centuries of discrimination have to pay the
price by losing their homes, their land, their money, their occupations, and even, at
times, their physical safety or lives. How many Palestinians live in the Diaspora now? How
many Palestinians have been slaughtered for no reason other than the fact that they are
the indigenous inhabitants of their own land? What right, morally, religiously or legally
do Jews from all over the world have to come and take a whole country away from its
rightful owners? When Iraq occupied Kuwait not so long ago, there were more than 30
nations involved in bombing the Iraqi civilians to pieces! Where is this same sense of
warped justice when it comes to the Palestinians? How can any group of people just go and
occupy the country of another? Palestine has been Palestinian for over 2,000 years. For it
suddenly to not exist does not make sense. And when one speaks of Palestinians, it
includes Christian, Jewish and Muslim Arabs. It must be remembered that these people lived
in relative peace before the advent of the European Jews who were looking for not only a
scapegoat in the Palestinian people, but also looking to make them victims of their own
expediency. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How many Palestinian children have grown up as orphans because their
fathers died as martyrs from the atrocities committed by Israeli soldiers and civilians?
Is it fair for humanity to cry tears for the persecution committed against one group of
people and then to turn a blind eye to the slaughter and attempts at genocide of another?
At the memorial where the Pope attended and presented his apology, there were six Jewish
survivors of the Holocaust...each one supposedly representing the six million killed in
the genocide. These Jews and others around them cried for what happened to Jews during
Hitler&#146;s regime. But who will cry for the Palestinians so ruthlessly and brutally
killed by the Israeli regime? How many memorials will be erected for those Palestinians
who have been butchered for no other reason except that they were Palestinian? Who will
cry for the Palestinian children who have been crippled by Israeli bullets and who will
cry for Palestinian children who are incarcerated when they should be out playing and just
enjoying the luxury of being children? Who will cry for all those Palestinian children who
were so heartlessly massacred? Who will cry for the mothers who have lost their children
or who cannot sleep at night because their sons are in prison? Who can even comprehend how
countless Palestinians have been physically and emotionally tortured by the Israeli Shin
Bet (and who put Hitler&#146;s SS to shame), the same group who are devoted to breaking
the spirit and the will of the Palestinians? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If anyone should apologize, it should not be Pope John Paul II for crimes
he is not guilty of, but it should rather be the Israelis for all the dark and inhuman
deeds that they have perpetrated against the Palestinians. And even then, an apology can
only be the beginning of a path to justice and peace. As long as Palestinians continue to
suffer at the hands of the Israelis and as long as Jews confiscate more and more
Palestinian land, there will never be a true, just or comprehensive peace in the Middle
East. Peace must be built on justice and decency. If there is no justice and if the
Israelis are not decent, whatever peace they speak of with their forked tongues hangs on a
very shaky foundation and will soon crumble into disaster. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Damned Are Those Who Win a War <br>
and Lose to a Verse of Poetry</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>By Ramzy Baroud*</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Books found at exhibitions are often categorized in a specific order,
usually based on topic, theme or even price and bargain. Palestinian book exhibits are
also categorized, yet differently, according to a unique priority and order. Just like
almost every aspect of Palestinian life, their ongoing struggle against Israel, their
quest for freedom and painful memories are the dominant messages conveyed by most of their
published books. A component of Israeli propaganda aimed at covering the tracks of the
many crimes committed against Palestinians was to silence their voices, sensor their
books, shut down their newspapers, and even assassinate their intellectuals. It should
come as a no surprise that Israeli Education Minister Yossi Sarid&#146;s idea to use
several pieces of prose and poetry written by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in the
Israeli school curriculum has threatened to topple the Israeli government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At first it appeared bizarre, absurd and even comical when Israeli
television channels showed angry Israeli parliament members resorting to bantering and
name-calling, and even urging to vote down the government over a few lines of poetry
written by Darwish. The story, however, is neither comical nor amusing. The Israeli
outrage and panic is, without a doubt, a sign of the deficiency in their Zionist ideology,
of the fragility of their moral stand and, first and foremost, of the fear of the truth,
which they have hardly sought to identify.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In my first visit to the Palestinian Writers Union in Gaza in the early
1990s, I was stunned to see that most of their posted books were written from inside
prison walls. In fact, the phenomenon is so old and common that Palestinian literature is
known as &#147;the literature of prisons.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Assuming that we are able to understand why Israel would imprison a
freedom fighter or a child caught with a rock in his hand, why do so many Palestinian
poets, writers and journalists spend many years of their lives in prison, without trial
and without any clear reason, except that of &#145;threatening the security of the State
of Israel&#146;? What does the Palestinian pen have that could threaten the existence of a
State which obtains enough nuclear capabilities to burn half of this world? The
truth&#133;maybe?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout the years, since its establishment on the ruins of Palestinian
towns and villages, Israel aimed at destroying the Palestinian account of the story. But
its mission was no easy task, since most Palestinians were banished to every corner of the
world seeking refuge and hoping for return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is as if the Israeli scheme meant to eliminate those who are most
likely to eloquently and skilfully uncover and diminish the Israeli myth. Those who
possess a great threat, of course, are the intellectuals who possess the power to awaken
the conscience and the minds of the people to Israel&#146;s fabrications. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Between July of 1972 and July of 1973, over a dozen Palestinian
intellectuals were murdered by exploding letters or car bombs in many world capitals. The
implementation of this tactic was hardly designed to destroy the intellect of an entire
nation. Israel meant to send another message, beside the exploding ones. It was a warning
signal to those who would try to challenge Israel&#146;s perspective on the legacy. The
warning simply advised that anyone who would try to contest Israel&#146;s reading of
history would collide with the same destiny as those Palestinian intellectuals. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unlike what many believe, Israel&#146;s argument and justification of
historical events is shabby, inconsistent, and too irrational even for unenlightened
philosophy. In a balanced world, the Israeli narration can hardly stand the simple yet
convincing logic of Palestinian intellect. And because Israeli leaders have always been
aware of such a fact, they worked, and are still working ceaselessly to forbid the
Palestinian word from reaching those who were never given the chance to hear it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Strangely enough, the past 52 years, which served to nurture and
strengthen the philosophy of Zionism&#151;the mother of current Israeli ideology&#151;have
failed to provide even a small &#147;security zone&#148; that would grant minimum
protection from the power of reason. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent political crisis in Israel created by Sarid&#146;s decision to
use some of Darwish's poetry was not exactly political nor was it inspired by a personal
disliking of the Palestinian poetic style. At any rate, it was understandable. In a court
where the criminal was being set free for lack of evidence, it would be absurd if his
lawyer allowed the testimony of a witness that might reverse the verdict and find him
guilty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With little means, Palestinians have courageously fought and many continue
to fight. While the Intifada challenged the legitimacy of the occupation with its troops
of children possessing only weapons of stones and small Palestinian flags, it defeated
that suppression. Now Israeli ideology faces the weapons of Palestinian prose and
literature, and again, it will eventually be defeated. How amazing and pathetic for a
country to withstand many wars and revolutions&#133;only to crumble under a few verses of
poetry.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Samia Abdennour</strong></i></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Samia Abdennour, a Palestinian refugee, recalls the diaspora of her family
50 years ago, its impact on her as a child and, later, as a mother.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One bright morning in June of 1947, my mother woke up and exclaimed,
&#147;Children, I have been giving the matter a lot of thought. We are going to
Egypt.&#148; My father had died five years before, leaving us well taken care of
financially, though not rich. My eldest sister and brother had graduated from high school
and wanted to enrol at university, and the options we had were either Cairo or Beirut. My
mother&#146;s choice was agreeable to us all. We fully intended to return back (to
Palestine) after completing our studies, and left the keys of our home with an uncle to
look after the house. Early in August, we bade our adieus to family and friends and
boarded the train that ran from Haifa directly to Cairo, to the land of glory and
learning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Upon arriving at Bab El-Hadid, our eager faces turned to bewilderment. It
was past midnight, yet the station was buzzing with life. Crowds were bustling here and
there, porters were shouting and pushing, peddlers were singing their wares and the neon
lights cast a greenish glow that made people look grotesque. My aunt and uncle came to
meet us and drove us by <i>hantour</i> to their home in Choubra. It was a memorable night.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Within less than a week, we found and rented a beautiful villa in
Heliopolis. My eldest sister, Aida, and brother, Farouk, were accepted by the Faculties of
Art and Pharmacy respectively. Amal, Souhail and myself were enrolled in school and all
our misgivings were allayed. Many relatives, whom we children did not know, came to visit
and through them we met and befriended many families with children of our own ages. Also,
before long, we became friends with all our neighbours. Life was smiling at us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the cities and towns in Palestine were small, and practically
everybody in town knew everybody else. We grew up in the friendly atmosphere of a large
family. Moreover, both a maternal and a paternal aunt had died in childbirth, and my
mother did not hesitate for a second to accept both infants to be raised with her brood.
For many years, we were seven boisterous children living under the same roof.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As soon as we settled in our new premises, the entire family began an
intensive correspondence with our friends in Haifa, Nablus and Jerusalem. The postman came
to know us by name, and nearly every day he would smilingly call to deliver one or more
letters. Even the Post Office officials at headquarters got so used to the sudden influx
of letters bearing our name that they directed a letter to my sister which was simply
addressed: Miss Aida Abdennour, Heliopolis, Egypt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though we settled down quickly to a happy, normal life, we were
apprehensive for our loved ones left behind in these disturbing times. We did not really
appreciate the horrors they were living through, until the unexpected arrival of our
grandmother, aunt and cousin Chibly. They described to us the nightmare they had suffered
while still living in Haifa and related why they had fled to the safety of our home in
Egypt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A group of well-armed Zionists raided the area where my grandmother and
her two married children lived with their families. The whole family ran to the shelter of
their basement. Some Arab residents, poorly armed, retaliated and incurred very heavy
losses. Following this barbaric attack, the Zionists broke into the three-storey building
firing left and right, smashing whatever was in sight&#151;furniture, windows, crockery,
doors&#151;leaving behind only rubble.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We were horrified to hear of such a barbaric monstrosity and welcomed them
with open arms, relieved that they were safe. But we worried over the rest of my
uncle&#146;s and aunt&#146;s families. Eventually we heard from them a couple of months
later, from Lebanon and Syria. Unlike my grandmother, they had stayed behind trying to
salvage some of their belongings. But when the tension grew too strong to bear, they made
their escape on foot, in a small rowing boat and on the back of a donkey.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was hard to believe that this was the country and the people we had
left just a few months ago. Palestinians&#151;Muslims, Christians and Jews&#151;had faced
no problems living together. They had lived amicably, sharing traditions, interests and
experiences. All our cities&#151;Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa, Nazareth&#151;held very dear
heirlooms to all three religions. The arrival of the Zionists changed this peaceful
coexistence. How could these emigrants profane this sacred land? What right did these
monsters have to come from the four corners of the world and usurp our homes?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Haifa, where I was born and spent my early childhood, holds many cherished
memories. It is a jewel of a city. It extends from the top of Mount Carmel, sloping
gracefully to the sea, combining both mountain and sea air. Its scenery is lovely. None of
the houses rose higher than three storeys, allowing everyone to enjoy the gorgeous
panorama. Traffic was very well organized, we queued at bus stations and I remember the
decorous manner with which the police officers directed the flow of the cars. There were
public gardens, playgrounds, tennis courts and beaches. All were kept clean and
functioning. Our school, Notre Dame de Nazareth, was built on the mountain slope,
surrounded by huge trees which we used to climb mischievously to hide from the nuns and
their punishments.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My father owned a plot of land on the slope of Mount Carmel, planted
mainly with olive trees, with a few scattered citrus and carob trees. There was also a
two-storey house and small shack for the keeper. We did not actually live there, but
rented it to a Jewish family. Before coming to Egypt, we lived for a few years in Nablus
owing to my father&#146;s work. However, whenever we were in Haifa, we visited our tenants
and played on the swing my father had installed on the lower porch.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The climax, of course, was May 1948. The Zionists took over our beautiful
country and in Cairo we suddenly found ourselves destitute. The regular monetary transfers
that we had arranged from Haifa came abruptly to a stop. The problem of feeding nine
people&#151;six growing children with very healthy appetites&#151;was no simple matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Believing this to be a temporary episode, we started by selling
mother&#146;s jewelry. One by one her jewels were sold but still no silver lining appeared
on the horizon. We then set about, each in his or her own way, to find a solution. My
mother, who normally sewed our dresses, became a dressmaker, sewing first the uniforms for
our school, then accepting clients at home. Aida left her faculty and taught in two
different schools, also doing secretarial work in the evenings. Whenever his time
permitted, Farouk worked in a pharmacy during the day and paid home visits in the evenings
to give injections. My aunt taught kindergarten and my grandmother took over the task of
housekeeping and cooking. The nuns at our school very kindly and discreetly allowed my
sister and I to finish our studies without paying tuition fees. During the summer
holidays, we all worked. The twins, Souhail and Amal, painted wooden toys in a toy
factory, while I helped a newly established shop with its advertising campaign. I was
given an old Remington typewriter (with the letter Q missing), a few cartons filled with
envelopes, the <i>Who&#146;s Who in Egypt and the Middle East</i> book, and was told to
type out the names and addresses found therein. I was paid the exorbitant amount of half a
piastre for every four typed envelopes. Quite a score&#151;one Egyptian pound for every
800 typed envelopes!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My mother firmly believed in higher education, and she also believed in
priorities. Men came foremost in this respect . She held the opinion that they are the
breadwinners and must be &#147;armed with all the necessary equipment to ensure a happy
and comfortable life for their families,&#148; whereas women depend on their husbands for
their livelihood. Therefore, her daughters, falling under the second category, worked,
while the boys went to university. We did not feel we were making a sacrifice, nor were we
envious of our brothers and cousin, but took our mother&#146;s argument for granted and
did as required.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eventually, the male members of our family graduated from university and
each found a job in his field. Our financial situation eased considerably, and Amal
regained her ambition to become a painter. She went to Les Beaux Arts to further her
studies, got involved with a political group and landed in jail for 28 months. Upon her
release, she accepted a job with the FAO in Libya and from there travelled and settled in
Paris to pursue her artistic ambitions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We all led a normal life, except for occasional jolts. One such incident
concerned my brother Souhail and his residence visa. Palestinians, like all foreigners,
were required to obtain an annual residence visa. One of the clauses in the application
necessitated a written letter from his employer. The time for the renewal of the visa
coincided with a time when Souhail was not on good terms with his superior. The latter
seized the opportunity and wrote a letter to the effect that Souhail was not in the least
indispensable. This resulted in the Passport Authorities issuing an order for
Souhail&#146;s deportation within a few days. It was a catastrophe! We argued our
Statelessness and pleaded with the authorities, but to no avail. As a last resort, Souhail
sent a telegram to President Nasser outlining his case, whereupon the order was cancelled
and the visa immediately granted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shortly afterwards, Souhail went to Lebanon in search of work. He applied
and obtained Lebanese nationality, based on his argument that we were part of a Lebanese
family bearing the same surname. He then accepted a job in Doha, Qatar, which he left
after three months to join cousin Chibly in Kuwait. Returning to Lebanon, he got married
and settled with his wife and two children, only to be ousted once again during the
Lebanese civil war. He now lives in Jordan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Farouk was quite content living in Cairo, until the emigration bug hit his
family&#151;wife and two sons. To comply with their nagging, he applied and obtained his
emigration papers to Canada, but assured everybody he was coming back. He accompanied the
family to Montreal, but with the exception of his younger son, Nadir, both his wife and
elder son disliked life in Montreal and returned to the safety of Egypt and its people.
While helping Nadir settle in his new surroundings, he discovered that he had very
advanced lung cancer. He returned to Cairo for one week, straightened his finances,
allotting all his material possessions to his family, bade us good-bye and returned to the
hospital in Canada where he passed away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aida is married to an Egyptian and lives in Paris where, before
retirement, she held an important position at UNESCO. Our mother passed away ten years ago
and is much missed by her family and the Palestinian organizations in Cairo with which she
worked. She had helped organize and supervise workshops where young girls did knitting and
needlework and also acted as interpreter whenever foreign delegations visited their
organizations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, nearly 51 years have passed since our arrival in Egypt and I feel
exceedingly happy and very lucky in many ways. Through marriage, I have acquired Egyptian
nationality and Egypt has definitely become my home, so much so that, when I accompanied
my husband to Nigeria in 1967, where he had accepted a temporary job for two years, I
became very depressed, in spite of the fact that I lacked nothing. I had my husband and
three children with me, we lived in a mansion on the campus, life was comfortable, but I
had a nagging feeling that I was living on quicksand. I felt again uprooted and made to
live in a country that was not my own. Luckily the two years passed without any unpleasant
incidents, and we returned to the comfort of home, family, friends and to welcome the
arrival of our fourth child.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My only regret is that our family is so dispersed. I have uncles and aunts
living in Lebanon, England, Switzerland, Honduras, Canada, the U.S., Paris, Jordan, Syria
and have lost contact with most of them. I was pleasantly surprised to discover, two years
ago, that the wife of the Ambassador of Honduras was my cousin, whom I had last seen in
August 1947. I also feel sad that my children hardly know their uncles, aunts and cousins,
which is a far cry from the happy, clannish way we were brought up.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though I thank my lucky stars for all the blessings with which I have been
endowed, I feel sad, angry and bitter at the injustice of life, the barbarity with which
Palestinians were and are still treated, the wasted lives of the millions of dead youth,
the grief of parents and widows, the inhuman state of the orphaned children, and the
oppression of the camp refugees. I cannot go back to my homeland; I cannot retrieve our
possessions; I cannot claim our land; I cannot take my children back to Palestine to share
with them my happy past; and I cannot visit my father&#146;s grave in Haifa. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">On war crimes, confessions and justice</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I bow my head in humility before those who were murdered, those who
have no graves at which I could ask their forgiveness.&#148; These were the words of
German President, Johannes Rau, as he addressed the Israeli Knesset on 17 February 2000.
Somehow, they did not sound like the words of a wily old politician seeking a convenient
appeasement. They came across rather like a desperate plea from the conscience of a nation
seeking reconciliation for wrongs committed in its name. While they may have met certain
demands, they also opened a vault of skeletons, long buried but not forgotten. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What of the other victims? For how much longer will the world continue to
cover up and ignore the crimes committed by the Nazi victims against the Palestinian
victims? One of the most appalling aspects of the Palestinian catastrophe is, undoubtedly,
the denial of their humanity and history. Every attempt on their part to tell their
narrative has been met with distortion, denial and outright scorn. For those who insist on
refuting the Palestinian version, we refer them to one of Britain&#146;s finest historians
of the twentieth century, Arnold J. Toynbee. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Writing the forward to John &amp; Hadawi&#146;s <i>Palestine Diary</i>
(1970), he declared, &#147;The story is a tragedy, and the essence of this tragedy is that
about 1,500,000 Palestinian Arabs (estimated today at 5,000,000) have now become refugees
as a result of the intervention of foreign powers in their country&#146;s affairs&#133;The
tragedy in Palestine is not just a local one; it is a tragedy for the World, because it is
an injustice that is a menace to the World&#146;s peace. Britain&#146;s guilt is not
diminished by the humiliating fact that she is now impotent to redress the wrong that she
has done. As an Englishman, I hate to indict my country, but I believe that Britain
deserves to be indicted, and this is the only personal reparation that I can make.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the face of it, the Jewish State and its allies prefer that it be
judged not by its deeds but by its intent. And since its motive is to &#147;form a part of
a wall of defence for Europe in Asia, an outpost of civilization against barbarism&#148;,
it has become quite easy for Westerners to forget the massacres, the war crimes and crimes
against humanity that were committed in April 1948. It is even more understandable why
they perceived the murder of women and children at Deir Yassin as
&#147;self-defence&#148;, &#147;accidental&#148; or &#147;collateral damage&#148;. In
reality, many Westerners still don&#146;t accept that the Palestinian Cause is rooted in
universally accepted standards of human behaviour and statutes of law. Hence they support
the initiatives that seek to resolve the conflict by granting the Palestinians token
gestures of compromise and economic reward. Yet, these were examples of the, presumably,
&#147;accidental&#148; casualties at Deir Yassin: </p>

<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Salhiyah Eid, nine months pregnant, a bullet in the neck and her womb cut open with a
      butcher&#146;s knife;</li>
    <li>Kadri Zidan, aged four, a bullet in the head;</li>
    <li>Muhammad Zidan, aged seven, a bullet in the chest.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As if laying his own claim to be the conscience of his nation, as
President Rau appeared to be, Professor Toynbee declared in his <i>magnum opus</i>,<i> A
Study of History</i>, &#147;In AD 1948, the Jews knew, from personal experience, what they
were doing, and it was their supreme tragedy that the lesson learnt by them from their
encounter with the Nazi gentiles should have been not to eschew but to imitate some of the
evil deeds that the Nazis had committed against the Jews&#148; (vol. viii, p. 290).</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The season of atrocity</b></u><br>
Had Deir Yassin been an isolated act of mad terror, its trauma might have been overcome a
long time ago. But this was not the case. There were other horrific atrocities such as the
attack on Nasrudin village near Tabariya on 10 April. All of its residents except 40 were
slaughtered. Because these constitute a ghastly pattern of crime often manifested in the
month of April, the pain never seems to go away. According to United Nations figures, the
Jewish State violated the truce with Arab countries 43,000 times between 1948 and 1967.
And, in the five-year period after 1967, its attacks on the refugee camps resulted in the
deaths of 2,500 civilians. Among these were 46 children (all under the age of 11) who
perished when their school, Bahr al-Baqar, was attacked with napalm bombs on 8 April 1970.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Three years later, the terror machine descended on Paris and Beirut to
celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Deir Yassin. The first victim of the 1973
operations was Dr. Basil al-Kubaisi&#151;gunned down on a Paris street on 6 April. Shortly
after, on 10 April, three senior PLO officials, Kamal Adwan, Muhammad Yusuf Hajjar (along
with his wife) and Kamal Nassar were all killed in their beds in Beirut. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Writing in their study of <i>Israel&#146;s Secret Wars</i>, Benny Morris
and Ian Black declared, &#147;The next blow against the PLO was far more important&#148;
(p. 469). It came on 16 April 1988. The victim was Khalil al-Wazir, murdered in his Tunis
home by &#147;Israeli commandos&#148;, according to the authors. Had the operation been
the reverse, the perpetrators would certainly have been &#147;Palestinian
terrorists.&#148; Significantly, Mr. Morris is widely acclaimed today as a pioneer of
Israel&#146;s &#147;New Historians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This eerie catalogue of Israeli April massacres would not be complete
without reference to Operation Grapes of Wrath. It started on 11 April 1996 with the
bombing of the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Bekaa Valley and Baalbek. Although it was
not carried out by &#147;commandos&#148; as Benny Morris would prefer to call them, it was
the handiwork of the even more curiously named &#147;Israeli Defense Forces.&#148; When it
ended on 27 April, 165 persons were killed in Lebanon, 401 wounded, 23,500 shells were
fired and 600 air raids were conducted during the 16 days. By all accounts, the most
revolting act of the entire operation was the massacre of 109 civilians sheltering in the
United Nations compound at Qana on 18 April. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Self-defence versus self-determination </b></u><br>
Like all the other massacres that preceded it, the Qana massacre exposed the root cause of
dissention that has kept alive the Arab-Israeli conflict for more than five decades, i.e.
the antipathy between occupier and the occupied. It preceded a general election in Israel
that was dominated by the issue of security and peace. For all its ferocity, though,
Operation Grapes of Wrath failed to secure the re-election of incumbent Prime Minister
Peres. His nemesis, Benyamin Netanyahu, skilfully portrayed him as a man who had no
answers to the growing audacity of Hamas at home and Hizbullah abroad. A former member of
Israel&#146;s special forces and editor of a book entitled, <i>Terrorism: How the West Can
Win</i> (1986), Netanyahu appeared eminently qualified for the job&#151;not that he was
any different from the man he succeeded.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Netanyahu&#146;s mission was plain and simple: to ensure that
Israel&#146;s self-defence prevailed over Palestinian self-determination. Toward this end,
the support of the West was more important than any agreement with the Palestinians. This
mind-set was well-illustrated by the title of his book. For even though he served as his
country&#146;s Ambassador to the United Nations, Netanyahu gave no consideration to the
fact that since 1973 the organization had proclaimed that international terrorism also
consists of repressive acts by colonial, racist or alien regimes against people struggling
for liberation. He held in apparent contempt resolution 3070 (XXVIII) of November 1973
which <i>&#147;Also</i> <i>affirms the legitimacy of the peoples&#146; struggle for
liberation from colonial rule and foreign domination and alien subjugation by all
available means including armed struggle.&#148;</i> And which<i> &#147;Condemns all
Governments which do not recognize the right to self-determination and independence of
peoples, notably the peoples of Africa still under colonial domination and the Palestinian
people.&#148; </i><b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Resilient as the olive tree</u></b><br>
This is the dilemma of the current peace process, as it has always been: the negation and
non-recognition of a people&#146;s identity and existence. Why should Palestinians be
hopeful of the future whentheir past is being denied? Surely they have a history like all
other peoples. The tragedy of their suffering is not just a matter of a few refugee camps
here and there. It is, moreover, the agony of an entire people at whose expense a foreign
State was established on their land. While the Jewish State has recognized the territorial
nature of the conflict, it has, ever since the 1940s, rejected the extra-territorial
dimension: that there is a Palestinian diaspora. One that is legally and morally entitled
to the right of return to its homes, wherever that may have been in Palestine before their
expulsion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians in the diaspora, such as the eminent academics and
professionals who, last February, reaffirmed this right of return in an international
declaration, have already been condemned as &#147;enemies of peace.&#148; To become
friends of peace, they must support the type of political settlement described by
Israel&#146;s Minister of Public Security, Shlomo Ben-Ami, during his recent visit to
London, in which the conflict would be watered down to a local &#147;border dispute&#148;
between the Jewish State and the Palestinian entity in the occupied territories. As if the
Palestinian nation had sacrificed thousands of martyrs only to settle for their permanent
exile in foreign lands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All the declarations and press releases concerning the current Middle East
peace process suggest that Israel&#146;s aim is to win Arab support while blocking their
support to the Palestinians. Any progress in this direction, clearly, spells more disaster
for the Palestinian Cause. For just as Arab division led to the loss of Palestine,
likewise their disunity will prevent its restoration. Whatever the outcome, this would not
break the will of the people who, like the native olive tree of Palestine, cannot be
totally expunged from the land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Surely any process which views the Palestinians more as pawns in a
political jigsaw and less than human beings will not succeed. Likewise, any peace process
that is not based on international law will only compound the problem. It would not stop
the cycle of human suffering. And so, even before the law is enforced, Israel must take
another giant step. Like President Rau did on behalf of his people, it must genuinely
acknowledge its culpability in crimes against the Palestinian people and against humanity.
Upon this premise, let the law be implemented to protect the weak. </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Dr. Naseer Aruri*</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>(1-2)</strong></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is a new reality, unwittingly produced by the Oslo accords, a
reality that had escaped the minds of many who watched the &#147;historic&#148; signing
either in person or on the screen from around the globe four and a half years ago. The
requirements for a just and durable peace are far different today from what they used to
be. These accords have dealt a crippling blow to the foundations of the global consensus
that defined the prerequisites for a just and durable peace during the 1970s and 80s. That
peace was predicated on the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own
independent state alongside Israel. That peace was to occur after Israel completed its
withdrawal from occupied territories in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolution
242, and after the Palestinians recognized Israel's existence and sovereignty in the
largest part of their own national patrimony.<br>
Six years after the &quot;historic handshake,&quot; it has become clear that the pursuit
of a negotiated settlement based on two states has probably run its course. That project
has been dealt a severe blow by a colossal imbalance of power, by a steady and growing
Israelization of American Middle East policy, by a vigorous drive of settler colonization,
by Arab disarray and failure to respond to the Israeli challenge, and by the exigencies of
the post-Cold-War era. The Oslo process has demonstrated that the so-called partners not
only are far apart conceptually but are hopelessly divided over interpretations and over
what the end results of the process should be. We have seen one agreement after another;
from Oslo I to Oslo II, from Cairo I to Cairo II, from Early Empowerment to the
disempowerment of the Hebron agreement, to the Wye River agreement, and now to the Sharm
al-Shaykh agreement, in which Arafat seems to have accepted, by implication, that U.N.
resolutions may not have constituted the basis for a final settlement. During the past
year, we have witnessed how the lone superpower had to employ vigorous diplomatic
resources to persuade Netanyahu, and then Barak, to meet partial commitments under the
Hebron and Wye Agreements. Clearly, these are agreements not meant for implementation.
They are drafted in such a way as to enable Israel to conquer territory and to displace
and dispossess under no-war conditions. Thousands of dunams of land have been confiscated
and thousands of Palestinians have been dispossessed since the Oslo signing, while the
built-in impasse continues unabated. It has proven to be most efficacious for Israel,
which supplies the drafts and invests in deliberate ambiguity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Oslo was a unique agreement that lacked a framework defining the rules of
negotiations and the ends of the negotiating process. There is neither an overarching
principle, a vision, nor a road map. The Palestinians were invited to discover whether
they have rights, but not to claim their internationally-guaranteed rights. They came on
the implicit assumption that Israel's military occupation does not even exist, and,
therefore, Israel's claim to the disputed (but not occupied) territories was at least as
good as theirs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli side, however, knows exactly what it wants; the Palestinian
side dreams about what it wants. The Israeli side continues to adhere to the letter -
their own letter - of the agreement; the Palestinian side continues to invoke the spirit.
The letter says that the enterprise is a mere agreement to reach agreement that
Palestinian sovereignty with jurisdiction over land and resources and at the points of
entry and exit is utterly out of the question; that Jerusalem is an Israeli city; and that
the Palestinians' struggle for emancipation- from the status of refugees and that of an
occupied people - will be dependent on Israeli good will, when and if final status
negotiations are held, and after the Palestine Authority complies with ever expanding
requirements, which totally negate all prospects for Palestinian emancipation. The letter
of Oslo renders the goal of Palestinian statehood impractical and obsolete; and yet the
Palestinian Oslo dream continues to hang on the spirit, which is nothing more than a thin
thread of hope devoid of any substance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Paradoxically, the Oslo process has led to an inevitable conclusion, which
its own architects had neither envisaged, contemplated, nor pursued, namely, the future
struggle is toward integration not separation, toward a pluralistic existence, not
exclusion, toward parity, mutuality common humanity, and a common destiny. This is the new
and important reality that the Oslo process</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">has generated. Ironically, this reality might be laying the foundations
for a joint Palestinian-Israeli struggle, which would emanate from a realization that the
lives of Palestinians and Israelis are inextricably intertwined. There is a common
interest in the economy, employment, water distribution, ecology, human rights, and
foreign relations. Readiness to translate this commonality into a structural framework
that would enable both people to derive equal benefits is not in the offing at the
present, nor is it likely to be in the near future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even if the Oslo process were to lead miraculously to some kind of a
breakthrough, the maximum gain for the Palestinians would be a fractured collection of
&quot;bantustans&quot; or non-contiguous enclaves on about 35-40 percent of the West Bank
and on about 65 percent of Gaza. Moreover, under most optimal conditions, with social
engineering similar to what was supplied and designed by Yossi Bellin and Mahmoud Abbas
(Abu-Mazin), something called Palestine may emerge, but will be only nominally
independent. As is well-known, independence had already been ruled out by the Labor-Likud
agreement of January 22,1997, entitled &quot;National Agreement Regarding the Negotiations
on the Permanent Settlement with The Palestinians.&quot; That document excluded
Palestinian sovereignty, removal of the settlements, negotiating Jerusalem, repatriating
the refugees, and dismantling the occupation, thereby upholding the status-quo but with a
great deal of cosmetic surgery. The difference between the surgeons of Likud and those of
Labor is that the latter are better prepared to disguise the structural flaws and to
exaggerate the beauty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And to those who argue that Labor's classical Zionist doctrine, which
espouses separation, would grant the Palestinians their separate political existence, I
say that the doctrine of separation has already been adapted to Likud's notion of
&quot;population mixture.&quot; This &quot;mixture&quot; idea was enunciated by Begin and
Shamir. Inherent in the autonomy scheme, it now translates into cantonization. Rabin's
peace, which Arafat often describes as a peace of the brave, has converged with
Netanyahu's process on bantustanization for 1/3 of the Palestinian people, leaving the
other 2/3 living in permanent exile or as second class citizens in Israel. This enterprise
has been discussed rather candidly by Likud supporter, William Safire of the <i>New York
Times </i>(September 10, 1997), who wrote that the map of a workable final deal stares us
all in the face: A Palestinian flag in a majority of the West Bank land and 98 percent of
its people, with road tunnels and over-passes making the new state's large enclaves
contiguous and independent of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The key words in Safire's statement are, of course, enclaves, tunnels, and
overpasses, which negate contiguity and independence. Since Oslo II, the Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza have begun to realize that they are residents of enclaves
&quot;separated&quot; from each other and from Israel, but indeed part of a &quot;greater
Israel.&quot; They are separated from the settlements, from Jerusalem, from each other's
cities and even villages, and from the Palestinian diaspora. This fragmentation is now
becoming social, economic, physical, and of course regional, despite Oslo's provision for
a single-unit Palestinian entity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In view of all this, if something called a state were to emerge, it would
be economically strangled by Israel, financially dominated by the World Bank and the IMF,
constrained by the requirements of globalization, militarily under Israel's mercy and
always anxious to please Washington and the international donors. Hence it will have to be
intolerant and repressive toward dissent, which has already been re-classified as
&quot;terrorism.&#148; It will be pressed to seek a confederal relationship with Jordan
and some kind of association with Israel, in which a Middle East version of NAFTA with <i>maquiladoras
</i>would serve as a symbol of development. Moreover, the price of that fictitious
statehood would include yet a new deferral of two key issues in the so-called final status
negotiations: Jerusalem and the refugees. This proposal was made by Ehud Barak on
September 1, 1999.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Quite clearly this is not what the Palestinian people have struggled for.
Nor is their struggle for an independent state within the Oslo framework likely to
succeed, for all the reasons already cited. This brings us to the new reality emerging out
of Oslo's inherent flaws. This is a new discourse about a broader social-economic struggle
for equal rights, equal citizenship, and equal legitimacy within a single
Israeli-Palestinian entity. It is seen by a growing number of people on both sides as a
viable alternative to perpetual conflict. On the Palestinian side for example, Edward Said
advanced the idea in an interview in the <i>Christian Science Monitor </i>(May 27, 1997):</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The whole idea of trying to produce two states is at an end. The
Oslo peace process is really in tatters. The lives of Israelis and Palestinians are
hopelessly intertwined. There is no way to separate them. You can have fantasy and denial,
or put people in ghettos. But in reality there is a common history. So we have to find a
way to live together. It may take 50 years. But ... the Israeli experience will gradually
turn back towards the world they really live in, the Islamic Arab world. And that can only
come through Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Palestinian intellectuals, including Nadim Rouhana and Adel Samara,
have been calling for a single state. Samara writes:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The only just and feasible form of a bi-national state is the
socialist one. It will have to be a state that will dissolve the Zionist regime, ...
cancel the Law of Return, stop importing new settlers, and guarantee the Palestinian right
of return and equality of land and resources <i>(News From Within, </i>April, 1997).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the Israeli side, endorsement of hi-nationalism comes from an unusually
divergent group, including liberal politicians, secular leftists, and right-wing rabbis.
For example, Meron Benvinisti writes:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The reality in Eretz Israel is a bi-national one. The reality inside
the green line is also bi-national. ...The model closest to my heart is Belgium. Two
people, the Flemings and the Walloons; two regional governments, and one central
government. The direction I would prefer is cantonization, the division of Eretz Israel
West of the Jordan River into Jewish and Arab cantons; I want it to be clear that I
include the Galillee and the Triangle in this proposal.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Haim Baram, a secular leftist, who is known to Western audiences through
his regular columns in <i>Middle East International, </i>has also adopted the idea of
bi-nationalism in order to avert an apartheid regime. On the religious right, we learn
from an article by Yair Sheleg <i>(News From Within, </i>March, 1997) that Rabbi Menachem
Fruman supports the idea of hi-nationalism on the grounds that it would guarantee the
&quot;wholeness of the land of Israel&quot; as well as the continuation of the settlements
in the West Bank:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147; I prefer loyalty to the land over loyalty to the state. I see the
    whole Israel movement as a post-Zionist movement, which represents an advance for Zionism
    over what it is today.&#148;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fruman expresses no apologies, however, for advocating two legal standards
in the single state - one for Jews and one for Arabs. Apartheid has its roots in the
hierarchy of classes during the Middle Ages. He adds: &#147;If you want, you can write
down that I want to take us back to the &#145;darkness&#146; of the Middle Ages.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obviously it is difficult to propose a blue print for bi-nationalism or to
even debate at this juncture the democratic secular state versus the bi-national state;
suffice it to say that the two people have been connected and are therefore being
challenged to explore the basis for a common existence, the proper modalities, the redress
of grievances, and paths to a common vision.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>By Ray Hanania*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I imagine waking up one morning into a different world. One where
anti-Arab bigotry doesn&#146;t exist, and where the Chicago news media slogans of fairness
and objectivity mean something.<br>
I buy a newspaper and I see among the many by-lines at least one Arab American reporter.<br>
And I flipped through the pages and I find a story about how more than 350 Arab Americans
joined to celebrate the retirement of one of our community leaders after many years of
serving the City of Chicago.<br>
There is a small Ad at the bottom of the page that teases me about a special section on
Palestine, a decade after the Intifadah, and promises of a commentary there by renown
Palestinian writer, Edward Said.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
After reading the newspaper, I get up and go to my car parked in the driveway. I see my
neighbor, who is Irish American, and he wishes me a Happy Ramadan Kareem.<br>
I wave back in gratitude even though I am not Muslim.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
I take out several letters that I want to send to friends and I go to the Post Office
where they offer me stamps that commemorate Ramadan, Khalil Gibran, and the historic visit
of the Orthodox Patriarch to the United States.<br>
I see the stamps on the shelf along with all the other stamps that commemorate Kwanza,
Christmas, Hanukkah, and all kinds of community leaders and events.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
I call work, and the message reminds me that today is a holiday, named in honor of
Muhammad, the Great Muslim Prophet, or maybe in honor of the first Arab American to die
while serving during World War I as a commander of the armed forces. Or, maybe, it is
Khalil Gibran Day.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
My daughter comes home from school, and instead of telling me about how she is harassed by
other kids because she is Arab, she delights in relating to me about how the class will
spend the next two weeks learning about the important culture of the Arab World.<br>
The teacher plans to discuss all of the great contributions that Arabs have made to the
sciences, to health, to music and to mathematics. There are so many, she can&#146;t tell
me about them all.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
And I turn on my television set to watch the news, and Mike Monseur, the CLTV reporter who
was demoted as anchor because of his Arab American heritage, is sitting next to Carol
Marin, detailing an exclusive investigation into corruption at Chicago&#146;s City Hall.<br>
In response, Mayor Daley has announced the appointment of celebrated Arab American
attorney William Haddad as a special investigator to oversee the probe to insure the
highest quality of legal leadership.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
The local cable TV program is also flashing on news about upcoming events, and I see that
the City of Chicago is gearing up for the Arab American Day celebration.<br>
There will be floats, and bands playing, and children waving Arab World flags. And
Americans will be standing on the sides of the street as the parade passes them by,
waiving and cheering as they do at the St. Patrick&#146;s Day Parade every year.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
Later, this summer, I will plan a few days off of work, so that I can take my family to
the annual Arab Food Fest, which will feature dozens of tents of Arab restaurants selling
filafel, hummos, lamb kabob, and stuffed grapeleaves.<br>
It&#146;s so crowded, it takes forever to get to the counter to place my order.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
The Sunday Tribune arrives at my door step and I pick it up and I see on the cover that
the book section features a review of my humor book, and books written by other Arab
Americans like Sammer Ghouleh, Edward Said, Salameh Zanayed and Rashid Khalidi.<br>
I have a dream.<br>
And then my wife shakes me out of my slumber, and I have to return to the real world where
Arabs face bigotry and the media ignores us. And I sigh. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Wow. I have a dream!<br>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Zaki al-Milad</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>(3-3)</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the view of George Tarabishi, the concept of globalization has not been
established yet, either in the English language in which the term was invented, or in the
various world languages, including Arabic, where scholars have difficulty in translating
the concept. Without having consensus on the meaning of globalization, the derivation of
the word itself suggests contradictory aspects of nationalism. Globalization is a
historical phenomenon of the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century
in the same way that nationalism in economics, politics, and culture was a phenomenon of
the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.14</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jaber Asfour contends that, &quot;The meaning of the term 'globalization'
does not diverge from the meaning of compartmentalization, which means imposing a
framework. The original derivation of both terms goes to the form fa'ala, which connotes
imposition. The connotation of force or imposition inherent in the derivation of
globalization, denoting compartmentalization or patriotism in one framework or a bigger
system, extends to the whole globe, and it does not differ from the realities of modern
serfdom.&quot;15</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabic writers have tried to present a description and analysis of a
phenomenon produced by another entity. The picture of globalization is not yet complete in
the Arab world, which lives its effects. Thus it is difficult to describe this phenomenon,
whose very nature is complex and interconnected. This explains the differences in opinion
in these writings, which have not gone beyond their own structural weaknesses, due to the
excessive dependence on issues and concepts produced by more advanced nations that are
increasing not decreasing in conceptual distance. There is a large and deep historical and
temporal and civilizational division between our world and the world of the advanced
nations. The phenomena that reach us from there take our time and use up our attention,
even though they have no real presence in our world. The way we concern ourselves with
globalization gives the impression that it is we who have conceived of it, even though the
reality is otherwise.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabic writers do not comprehend what they want from globalization, and do
not identify its dimensions and traits in a quantitative and qualitative manner, nor do
they agree on its nature and philosophy and movement and temporal framework. The
methodological and structural imbalance that occurred with previous concepts will repeat
itself. Before we complete our view of globalization, and understand its dimensions and
variations in our present reality, and know what we want from it, and know how to respond
to it, we will be faced with a different and critical view from the West stemming from
post-globalization or the end of globalization, in the same way that previous terms were
addressed, such as modernity and post-modernity, industrial society and post-industrial
society, philosophy and the end of philosophy, and history and the end of history. We will
be caught up in the discussion of post-globalization or the end of globalization if it
originates in the West, since it is the source of legitimacy for these terms, as far as
the misguided writings are concerned, until a new term comes to us from the West, and we
will end up repeating the cycle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>Islamic Thought and Globalization</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is still a long way to go before the Islamic writers begin to
address modern issues and phenomena. There is a delay in addressing these concerns in
terms of description, analysis, and critique. This exposes the lack of understanding in
this literature. Globalization has been an area of concern and has engendered the widest
array of discussions and arguments and critiques among world centers. Nevertheless, it
still has not captured the concern of the Islamic writers in the Arab world, especially
concerning the issues and phenomena that have captured the world's attention. An exception
is the issue of cloning. This has attracted the attention of Islamic writers, who have
weighed in with Islamic thought in this area and have garnered the attention of others.
The early concern with this issue has arisen due to the highly sensitive legal and
religious dimensions of cloning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The absence of Islamic thought in dealing with contemporary issues and
affairs of international importance has left a clear mark on the presence and
effectiveness of this thought on the world stage. This has occurred at a time when Islam,
as a religion and ideology and civilization, has attracted the widest world attention.
This makes the absence of Islamic thought all the more puzzling and explains why we cannot
provide a review of how Islamic literature has analyzed and critiqued globalization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The West has presented and commented on globalization, which has scared
the world, and which has received a great deal of criticism and resistance. This does not
mean that globalization is the only crushing issue in the world that is imposed on nations
without choice or desire. Islam contains active capabilities, moral, legal, and
civilizational that are very important for expressing an alternative globalization,
fundamentally different in its content, form, philosophy, and goals from Western
globalization. Islam came for the world and for all people, without racism, class
division, or discrimination, and it is one of the first civilizational ideologies and
religions to be global.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al Jabiri tried to differentiate between globalization, coming from the
West, and universalism, coming from Islamic civilization. He states, &quot;Globalization
is one thing and universalism is another. Universalism opens up to the world, and to other
cultures, and preserves ideological differences. Globalization is a negation of the other,
and creates a cultural breach rather than an ideological debate.&quot;16</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islamic concepts of globalization give rise to the need for a strategy
that Dr. Robert Crane, the Muslim founder of The Center for Civilizational Renewal, two
decades ago called &quot;peaceful engagement.&quot; He distinguishes this from the
hostility of civilizational clash and from the indifference or passivity of peaceful
coexistence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the most relevant verses portraying the Islamic view in this regard
is God's statement: &quot;O people we have created you from a male and a female, and we
have made you peoples and tribes so that you may know one another; verily the most noble
of you in the sight of Allah is the most pious; verily Allah is most knowledgable and most
informed.&quot;17</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This verse establishes a foundation for relations among peoples and
civilizations on the basis of knowing one another, and not on the basis of conflict or
confrontation or negation or banishment. A theory has been put forth based on an analysis
of this verse known as the theory of inter-civilizational knowing. This can be a third way
in need of exploration to counter what is presented in the West as the clash of
civilizations and the dialogue of civilizations. If civilizations do not come to know one
another, then they can never get rid of confrontation in order to reach a situation of
dialogue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Knowing one another is a very elevated concept, action-oriented, and one
of the most needed by nations and civilizations. It is a call for each nation and each
civilization to discover and know each other, without domination or imperialism or
destruction or banishment. Knowing one another establishes the presence of the other and
not the negation of the other. It also establishes a mutual relationship and cooperation
and communication, rather than cutting off and preventing and resistance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If there is an Islamic understanding of globalization, then it is the idea
of knowing one another, which means universal communication and universal openness for all
nations and civilizations. Islam has linked globalization to the idea of the shared origin
of humanity, &quot;we have created you from a male and a female,&quot; and the idea of
human differentiation, &quot;we have made you peoples and tribes,&quot; and the idea of
honor based upon piety,&quot; the most honorable among you is the most pious.&quot;18</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Globalization as presented by the West is based on material gratification
and economic greed, the hoarding of resources, and the lifting of restrictions on markets
and the siphoning of wealth. These have been factors in encouraging conflict and
confrontation. Multinational corporations (MNCs), also known as multi-continental
corporations, lead globalization in the world, and they have invented globalization and
preached it. They are the most capable at running it and directing it, all the while being
motivated by economics, which is the original arena of globalization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the last 15 years, multinational firms have achieved phenomenal growth,
the result of which is globalization. In 1975, MNCs numbered 11,000 and owned 82,000
branch companies all over the world. The total sales of MNCs constituted 25% of world
trade. In 1990 there existed 37,500 MNCs with 207,000 branch companies overseas. The total
sales reached half of the world gross national product, while the sales of the branch
companies equaled the size of world trade.18 Western globalization is essentially
economic, looking for profit and material gain. The other aspects of globalization, such
as culture, society, education, and the media, were used to promote the economic goals.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This globalization serves the interests and the ideas of the more powerful
in the world, and puts down the less powerful. This is not the globalization that the
world needs or that the world looks forward to on the eve of the 21st century.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>Facts and Conclusions</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1) There is no doubt that humanity needs to create an international
realization of shared obligations in dealing with the dangers and challenges that the
whole world faces, especially in the areas of human rights, freedoms, social equity,
environmental management, global warming, health, housing, poverty, famine, and water
scarcity, and that this can be done only by improved communication and contact at all
levels among all parts of the human family. We support globalization that promotes
awareness of world problems, issues, and concerns.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2) The world needs a globalization created, shaped, and formed by all the
world's peoples, rather than by one actor as the sole author using it to further national
interest and according to a narrow intellectual and economic and social agenda. If
globalization has been confronted by strong criticism and severe rejection, it is because
it is one-sided and has represented only the West.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The world, in its vastness and expansiveness, does not accept one point of
view, and does not need it. If the West has been able to force itself on the world, then
other nations will not continue to be under its control forever. This is the wisdom of
history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3) The real problem is not globalization, but rather the variance in
civilizational development around the world. This has allowed the West to be the
beneficiary of globalization, since it has accomplished its modernization goals and is
able to steer world conditions according to its agenda. The challenge facing the other
nations is to achieve their own programs of development and modernization, because
globalization is a product of progress and they need progress compatible with it. The
problem with the West is that it has turned its program of development into a program of
domination in pursuit of world control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The real challenge for globalization is through development and the
accomplishment of civilizational progress.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4) The biggest change would be for the West to change its view of the
world, after it has become the biggest influencer of the world's concerns and progress.
The West wants to take more from the world than it has given. What more does the West want
of modernization than it already has? What does it want from civilization after all that
it has achieved? Probably it is utopian to think that the West can reevaluate and change
its view of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, history teaches us, and history is the best teacher for
those who want to learn, that the world will not stay the same, and that history does not
go in one direction. The West does not represent the height of progress, nor the height of
modernity and civilization, nor even Fukuyama's &quot;end of history.&quot; Whoever has
mastered progress today is not necessarily the possessor of progress forever, and those
nations that lost their civilization can find it again, because history can change at any
time and is more knowledgeable of its own laws and processes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">5) The real threat to the world's cultures and identities from
globalization is a result of weakness and depression in these cultures. Thus these
identities and cultures must internally renew themselves so that they will gain immunity
from corruption as well as strength to persevere in their higher mission.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Globalization has its questions, both spoken and unspoken, and it will
open more than one possibility for the world and the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Direct financial support of rabbis and students of Talmud is,
nevertheless, a relatively new innovation in Judaism. During the lengthy period of Talmud
composition, approximately 50 BC<i> </i>to AD 500, and for centuries thereafter, rabbis
and students received no salaries or any other forms of financial support for talmudic
study. (Elementary teachers who taught Bible to small children were paid.) Indeed, the
Talmud itself prohibited payments for talmudic study. Some talmudic sages were working
class people who had well- known professions and earned their livelihoods from their
labors. Thc only form of financial reward that was allowed for a talmudic sage was a
recompense for not working. This can be illustrated by a talmudic anecdote about one of
the most important sages, Abaye, who lived in Babylonia in the fourth century AD. Abaye
was a farmer and cultivated his farm by himself. If asked a question by someone while
working, he told the questioner: &quot;Work on this irrigation canal for me while I ponder
your question.&quot; The last important rabbi who fully supported such behavior was
Maimonides, who died in 1204. Maimonides' ruling in his <i>Learning</i> <i>Torah Laws </i>(chapter
3, verse 10) is often quoted by secular, Jewish Israelis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyone supposing that he will engage in Torah [talmudic study] and not
  engage in labor, thus taking his livelihood from charity should be considered a person
  who: has extinguished the light of religion, put Torah to shame, caused evil to himself
  and lost his chance to enter paradise, since it is forbidden to make profit form the
  sayings of Torah in this world. The sages said: &quot; Everyone who makes profit from the
  sayings of Torah loses his life.&quot; They [the sage] have also ordered and said:
  &#147;Do not make it [Torah] either a crown in which to boast or an axe with which to
  work.&#148; And they [the sages] have further ordered and said: &quot;Love labor and hate
  the rabbinate,&quot; All Torah not accompanied by labor will be nullified; and the end of
  such a person [so engaged] will be that he will rob the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Israeli secular Jews use this statement of Maimonides to document.
their contention that all rabbis especially rabbis in Israel, are robbers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why for centuries have almost all religious Jews not paid attention to the
opinion of Maimonides, which is solidly based on many talmudic passages? The answer is
that religious Jews read any sacred text including the Talmud and the writings of
Maimonides, only with the help of the most sacred commentaries that become the accepted
religious opinions. Regarding the above quoted passage of Maimonides, the most important,
subsequent commentary is &quot;Kesef Mishne&quot; (&quot;an addition of silver&quot;),
written by Rabbi Joseph Karo, who died in 15 75. Karo, the author of <i>Shulhan Arutch </i>which
to date is the most authoritative compendium of the Halacha, opposed the opinion of
Maimonides on this issue. Almost all subsequent rabbis accepted the opposing position of
Karo. In the beginning of his &quot;Kesef Mishne,&quot; Karo mentioned that Maimonides in
his commentary on Mishne wrote at length. against salaries of rabbis and presented a
sizeable list of talmudic rabbis who were laborers receiving no salaries for talmudic
studies. Karo wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">He, let his memory<i> </i>be blessed [Maimonides], brought the example of
  Hillel, who was wood- cutter while a talmudic student. This is not proof. We must assume
  that be [Hillel] engaged in labor only at the beginning of his studies. In his [Hillel's]
  time there were thousands of talmudic students; perhaps, they gave financial support only
  to the most famous among them.. But how can we assume that when Hillel became famous and
  was teaching the people they did not give him financial support?</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Religious Jews in Israel use this form of reasoning,<sub> </sub>which
without adequate proof attributes customs of current rabbis to the hallowed past. Secular
Israeli Jews often have satirized such reasoning by telling a joke that is known to almost
every Israeli Jew. This joke is based upon the fact that, although no halachic reference
exists concerning an obligation of a male Jew to wear a head covering, there is no other
visible custom to which religions Jews are universally so faithful. Indeed, the popular
Hebrew saying for<i> </i>a formerly religious male that became secular is &quot;He took
off his skullcap.&quot; The joke centers upon a rabbi's being asked to provide the proof
for the obligation that male Jews must wear head coverings. The rabbi in the joke answers:
'The Bible says: 'And Abraham went' [to a certain place]. Can you imagine that he went
without a head covering?&quot; The joke's ridiculing of the usual mode of rabbinic
reasoning is obvious.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Karo argued that all famous sages, described in the Talmud itself as
laborers or craftsmen, must have been given financial support. Karo concluded by arguing
that priests in the temple were paid for their work and that, therefore, rabbis, who are
equivalent to priests, should be paid. Talmudic students should be paid, Karo maintained,
because without students there 'would be no rabbis. &quot;Those in control of the usual
expenditures [in Jewish congregations] should be compelled to pay the rabbis,&quot; he
stated. &quot;The current custom is that all Jewish rabbis receive their salaries from the
[Jewish] public.&quot; This was the general custom in the sixteenth century, except in
some distant communities such as Yemen. The salaries of rabbis continually increased as
did the occasions on which they took fees from their captive public. Evidence of rabbinic
corruption in Jewish communities since the latter part of the seventeenth century is
abundant. The rabbinate's alliance with rich people in oppressing poor people, especially
in Ashkenazi communities, and the use of bribery and other undue influence in the
appointments of rabbis are but two of the many aspects of this corruption. Corrupt
practices of many Israeli rabbis, both Haredi and NRP, have been well-documented by the
Israeli Hebrew press and are widely known in Israel. This corruption is a continuation of
a long-term trend.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The granting of special privileges for pursuing sacred studies exists in
modern Israeli society. One of the most controversial issues in the State of Israel has
been, and continues to be, the deferments from military service for most students and
graduates of yeshivot. These students and graduates first receive a draft deferment on the
basis.of declarations from heads of yeshivot. When their deferments expire, the students
or graduates are either entirely exempted from army service or are inducted directly into
the army reserve forces after undergoing only brief and cursory recruit training. They are
disqualified from serving in any dangerous or even unpleasant capacities. Their chances of
being killed or wounded in wartime are thus greatly reduced. Their deferments mean that
these students or graduates do not have to serve in the army for the period of three
years, which is compulsory for all other Israeli Jewish males who are between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-one. In his analysis of this situation, Ehud Asheri reported in his
August 22, 1996 article, published in <i>Haaretz, </i>that at that<i> </i>time 5 per cent
of all Jewish males were so deferred.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The vehement passions aroused by and the debates over this issue have
antagonistically deepened the split between Israeli Jewish secularists and the Haredim.
Currently, many secular Jews complain, as they and others have in the past, that the
Haredim do not share equally with other Israeli Jews the tasks and burdens imposed upon
society. The Haredim argue, as they continually have in the past, that such reasoning is
fallacious. Influenced by their education, the Haredim are convinced that all victories as
well as defeats of the Israeli army are due to God's intervention and that without doubt
God takes into consideration the numbers, progress in study and commitment of those Jews
who engage in talmudic study. The Haredim cite numerous passages in the Talmud and in
subsequent talmudic literature that are emphatic on this point. Not only the privileged
students and graduates of yeshivot but also traditional Israeli Jews support the Haredim
and the cited sacred Jewish writings on this point.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attitude of many secular Israeli Jews towards sacred studies and the
Talmud is the exact opposite of that held by the Haredim. Secularly oriented parodies of
the Talmud have remained popular and still abound in Israeli society. Many of these
parodies revolve around the Haredi rationale underlying the deferment and exclusion from
military service. In December 1988, for example, during one of the recurrent disputations
about the deferment from service of yeshiva students, the Haredim pointed to the talmudic
version of the biblical account of the victories of Yo'av, the general of King David. The
Haredim quoted the talmudic interpretation that these victories were attributable to
David's sacred studies, since in their view Talmud in an oral form dated back to Moses and
perhaps to Abraham and was written later. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What many foreign observers of Israeli Jewish society have not grasped is
that, even with the scientific and technological accomplishments in Israel; the Haredim
and most other Israeli Jewish fundamentalists live figuratively in a time period that
corresponds closely to European Christian societies many generations ago. These
fundamentalists have not made the quantum leap, as have secular Israelis, into modem
times. The tension between fundamentalist and secular Israelis, therefore, stems mostly
from the fact that these two groups live in different time periods.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Haredim often propound theories even more extreme than those mentioned
previously. Many Haredi rabbis, for example, assert that the Holocaust, including most
particularly the deaths of one-and-a-half million Jewish children, was a well-deserved
divine punishment, not only for all the sins of modernity and faith renunciation by many
Jews, but also for the decline of Talmudic study in Europe. The Haredim and their
traditional Jewish followers attribute the death of every Jew, including each innocent
child, not to natural causes but to direct action of God. The Haredim believe that God
punishes each Jew for his or her sins and sometimes punishes the entire Jewish community,
including many who are innocent, because of the sins committed by other Jews. In 1985,
when twenty-two children, twelve and thirteen years of age, were killed in the town of
Petah Tikva in a traffic accident involving their bus, Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, one of the
heads of the Shas Party and the then Minister of the Interior, stated in a television
appearance that the children were victims, because a movie house was allowed to remain
open on the Sabbath eve. Many members of the Hebrew press, predominantly representing
secular Jews, attacked Rabbi Peretz mercilessly for making this statement. The Shas Party,
nevertheless, in the next election did not lose but rather gained votes in various places,
including Petah Tikva. The Haredim held and advocate similar beliefs about God's punishing
and rewarding Jews in many areas of life on the basis of Jews' either committing sins or
following God's word.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the late 1990s, the primary concern of the Haredim is to expand their
educational system, especially in poorer localities wherein they successfully offer
material inducements such as hot meals. The Haredim strongly lobby the non-Haredi public
schools with their propaganda. In some places these lobbying efforts are successful. In
other areas the fierce opposition by parents who are educated and politically effective
thwarts the Haredi propaganda and lobbying efforts. Haredi influence is sometimes extreme
in specific places. In Netivot, one of the most religious towns in Israel, for example,
the Haredim have successfully opposed any public high school, because it would be
obligated to provide instruction in secular subjects. Netivot is the only Jewish town in
Israel without a high school.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Introduction</font></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Economics as the Extension of War through Non-violent Means</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In bygone days, the abundance of economic resources and a large vibrant
economy were crucial prerequisites for the financing of military effort in times of war
and peace. An economy served thus as a strategic reserve and helped project a nation's
military power and political will onto other nations through the sheer formidability of
its readiness for war.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Every economy gained in this context a security dimension. However, after
the Second World War and the massive introduction of nuclear and other unconventional
weapons, new interactions emerged in the synergy of the economy and the military. Nuclear <i>d�tente</i>
meant that direct military conflict between superpowers became a less viable option. Thus,
economic means in international conflicts ceased to play second fiddle to military means
and leaped to the forefront of the stage to become the very instrument with which
engagements and wars between nations are fought.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The defeat of the Soviet Union in the Cold War aptly illustrates this
point. The historical record indicates that it is not true that the Soviet Union failed
totally in the economic sphere. But ultimately, it was in that sphere that the Soviet
Union finally found its defeat. In fact, the Soviet system succeeded in completing the
industrial revolution launched by Peter the Great and in providing for the basic needs of
the Soviet peoples through the mass-production of homogeneous goods for food, clothing and
housing. It succeeded furthermore in building superb technological capabilities in the
field of military industry. However, where the Soviet Union failed crucially was in the
economic competition in the civilian sector. This was most evident in the failure of
central planning to mass-produce good-quality, non-homogeneous or durable consumer goods
(such as TVs, VCRs, PCs, automobiles, etc.). A weak civilian sector meant a lower standard
of living and provided fewer resources for military purposes or economic growth. The fact
that the Soviets preferred to divert scarce resources to the defense industry despite this
highlights the primacy of the economic factor. Subsequently, the failure to keep up with
the West economically was aggravated by the severe depletion of scarce economic resources
in an arms race that was accelerated by the West in the 1980s, specifically with the aim
of bankrupting the Soviet economy. The Achilles heel of the Soviet Union therefore was not
in its military, but rather in its economy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Where the Soviet Union failed then was at peace, not at war. It would have
been very costly for the West to rely upon military means to try to defeat a Soviet Union
armed to the teeth with nuclear and conventional weapons, especially after the West's
partial or total failures in Korea, Vietnam and other regional conflicts. Economics was
therefore used as a tool for the perpetuation of war through non-violent means. The Soviet
Union fell without a shot being fired by the West. And ever since, a new era in
international relations has emerged where economics, rather than being a force to bind
nations as neo-liberal theory claims, became the war zone itself. Military means are still
occasionally used as a supplement to reinforce America's economic and political dominance
in international relations, but only when the risk is low and the stakes are high.
Economics as a tool of domination in international affairs became thus a crucial aspect of
globalization under the auspices of the New World Order.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">The Economics of Zionist Peace</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why the Soviet Union failed to keep pace with the West in the economic
sphere, especially in the 1970s and1980s, is beyond the scope of this article.
Understanding the contemporary economic dimension of international conflicts is crucial,
however, to understanding the economics of Zionist peace, as propounded by Shimon Peres in
his book, <i>The New Middle East</i>, for example. In that book, Peres delineates &#147;a
new vision for the Middle East&#148; where security (for &#147;Israel&#148;) rests upon
economic rather than conventional military or political considerations. Economic and
political hegemony through bilateral and multilateral agreements, rather than strategic
depth in the geographical sense, assumes the geopolitical importance previously accorded
to the direct occupation of physical space. Buffer zones such as South Lebanon and the
Golan Heights, according to Zionists who embrace this view, need to become outdated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the end of this article, we will try to show that the characteristics
of &#147;Israel's&#148; economic and technological strength will generate
&#147;Israeli&#148; economic hegemony in the region EVEN IF &#147;Israel&#148; managed by
some miracle to rid itself of its racist, expansionist and militaristic essence. However,
&#147;Israel&#148; is not about to rid itself of that intrinsic essence as Peres
demonstrates in his aforementioned book. In fact, these Zionist characteristics are
undergoing a metamorphosis in which they assume an inherently more sinister, yet seemingly
more benign form. The conventional appearance of Zionist aggression is about to be dropped
in exchange for a post-Zionist economic and political hegemony that is not any less
dangerous. Here, once again, economics is viewed as a battlefield, as the perpetuation of
war through cheaper and currently more effective means. In the meantime, the value of the
economic prize of normal and peaceful exchange relationships with &#147;Israel&#148; were
summarized by a group of authors in a study in Hebrew, namely &#147;Israel 2020: A
Comprehensive Plan for the New Millenium, 1996.&#148; According to that report, there are
five reasons why the so-called peace treaties with Arab regimes are shoring up the Zionist
entity economically in the short run. These are:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Lightening the security burden on the &#147;Israeli&#148; economy</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the mid-1980s, the share of military expenditure to GNP (gross
national product) decreased steadily. In 1967, the percentage of military expenditures to
GNP was 6%. During the war of attrition with Egypt in the late 1960s that percentage rose
to 10% then 14%. After the October war in 1973, it rose to 15% and then 18%. This
percentage began to decline again after the Camp David Treaty with Egypt, and the
subsequent invasion of Lebanon in 1982, to eventually reach 8% in 1995 after the signing
of Oslo and Wadi Arabah. There was a qualitative benefit to these treaties as well,
manifesting itself in the transfer of highly skilled workers, engineers and scientists
from the army to the civilian sector. The lightening of the military burden was not
affected by the Egyptian military build-up in peacetime either, since the primary source
of Egyptian weaponry has been the friendly United States, according to the
&#147;Israeli&#148; report. The same report moreover adds that after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Syria lost its main source of arms supplies. Combined with a weak economy,
Syria stopped trying to pretend that it was remotely close to achieving a &#147;strategic
balance&#148; with &#147;Israel&#148;. (Of course, keep in mind that the last two
conclusions with respect to having Syria and Egypt under control should be taken with more
than a grain of salt since the inculcation of defeatism in the Arab psyche has been a
long-standing Zionist objective - FAV.)</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Expanding &#147;Israeli&#148; exports to previously closed markets</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, after the signing of peace treaties, &#147;Israeli&#148; exports
(and diplomatic relations) expanded to previously closed markets. In traditional export
markets in North America, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia, &#147;Israeli&#148;
exporters gained renewed confidence and a more enthusiastic reception. For the same
reasons, tourism to &#147;Israel&#148; flourished, with the exception of the years of bus
attacks carried out by Hamas.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Lowering the cost of borrowing on international credit markets</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the Madrid Conference, and after the United States government agreed
to grant &#147;Israel&#148; $10 billion in loan guarantees, international credit markets
opened up enthusiastically to the &#147;Israeli&#148; government. Risk ratings for
&#147;Israel&#148; were re-estimated downwards. As a result, &#147;Israel&#148; had access
to loans much greater than the value of the American loan guarantees, and at much lower
rates of interest than before. In 1995, <i>Moody&#146;s</i> and <i>Standard and
Poor&#146;s</i> gave the &#147;Israeli&#148; government a credit rating of 'A'. Naturally,
a higher credit rating has given &#147;Israel&#148; access to more funds at lower rates of
interest. (The rule for credit markets in capitalism is: the less you need a loan, the
more likely you are to get it, the lower your rate of interest; the higher the risk of
default, the higher the interest charged, if you manage to get the loan at all, that is -
FAV.)</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. Decreasing the minimum necessary rate of return to coax</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">foreign investment into &#147;Israel&#148;</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of &#147;Israel's&#148; biggest enticements to foreign investments,
especially in the field of high technology, pertains to the abundance of highly skilled
labour in the Zionist State. Nevertheless, foreign investment flows to &#147;Israel&#148;
were meagre for many years, not exceeding half a billion dollars annually, compared to
local investments reaching about $12 billion annually in the early 1990s.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most important field for foreign investments was indeed in hi-tech
industry where &#147;Israel&#148; enjoys a comparative advantage. However, even there,
many of these investments were motivated as well by non-economic incentives such as
adherence to staunch Zionism by the owners or managers of some transnational corporations.
Examples include the managers of Intel, and the owners of Vichi Israel. Other heavy
foreign investors in &#147;Israel&#148; include Motorola, National and Semiconductor.
Another remark in this regard is that Zionist capitalists outside &#147;Israel&#148;, as
well as devout pro-Zionist Jews, preferred generally to donate money to &#147;Israel&#148;
rather than to invest their money there.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, since the signing of Oslo and the Paris agreements with the PLO,
many changes began to take place. Foreign investment flows that were less than half a
billion dollars annually in the early 1990s increased dramatically in 1995 to $2 billion,
then to $3.1 billion in 1996, and to more than $5 billion in 1997. Because of its many
advantages, it is expected in the future that transnational corporations will prefer to
locate in &#147;Israel&#148; rather than in Arab countries, provided they have easy access
to its Arab neighbours. The point is that with decreased risk, a lesser rate of return on
investment is necessary to entice investments. Therefore, with the signing of the peace
treaties, a lower rate of return than before became necessary to attract foreign capital
to areas in which &#147;Israel&#148; enjoys a competitive advantage such as hi-tech, and
to other areas in the &#147;Israeli&#148; economy.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">5. Reaping direct benefits from normal economic relations with
oil-producing Arab States</p>
</b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Israel's&#148; reliance on safe and guaranteed sources of oil
from Arab States will enable it to reduce the cost of maintaining its huge caches of oil
that it keeps on reserve. Think about it like this: if you keep large stocks of any good
for long periods of time, that would be like freezing money equivalent to the value of
these stocks at any particular point, instead of investing that money or depositing it in
a savings account to gain interest. Furthermore, there is the additional cost of
maintaining these stocks, in terms of warehousing and personnel. As for easy
&#147;Israeli&#148; access to Arab natural gas, that will revolutionize the generation of
electricity which currently relies on oil and coal, which in turn will lower the total
cost of generating electricity in addition to keeping the environment clean.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, peace treaties do not imply the end of the Zionist project, but
represent a new phase in that project in which &#147;Israel&#148; resorts to economic
tools to achieve Zionist objectives rather than (or alongside) military ones. But note
that the &#147;Israeli&#148; report did not make any mention of lightening the burden of
supporting &#147;Israel&#148; on the United States government, which has to send several
billion dollars of American taxpayers&#146; money annually to the Zionist entity.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Long-Term Effects</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Normal economic exchange between the Arab States and any type of
&#147;Israel&#148;, even a seemingly non-racist and non-expansionist one, will have to be
analyzed in terms of three dimensions: (1) the movement of goods and services; (2) the
movement of labour; and (3) the movement of capital.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Looking at those dimensions one by one will inevitably reflect the uneven
terms of exchange that will necessarily arise between an advanced and technology-driven
&#147;Israeli&#148; economy, and the underdeveloped Arab economies, whether oil-producing
or not.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. The movement of goods and services</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers before trade with
&#147;Israel&#148; will bring about a division of labour between &#147;Israel&#148; and
its Arab neighbours that will reflect the comparative advantages enjoyed by the
&#147;Israeli&#148; economy, especially in the area of high technology. This will
eventually lead to the creation of a centre-periphery type of relationship with an
advanced regional &#147;Israeli&#148; metropolis that controls large swaths of the
backward Arab periphery. The advantage of geographic proximity will lower transportation
costs, thus enabling &#147;Israeli&#148; products, made in &#147;Israel&#148; or by
&#147;Israeli&#148;-owned firms, to replace local products and other foreign imports. In
the case of light industry and agricultural goods, trade with adjacent Arab neighbours
will lower the cost of importation for &#147;Israel&#148; thus improving its
balance-of-trade deficit, before leaping forth to control these economic sectors
financially. The volume and value of trade with &#147;Israel&#148; will increase perhaps
to the point of creating dependency on &#147;Israel&#148; and will strengthen its economy
to the point of dwarfing neighbouring Arab States economically and politically. Thus the
New Middle East is achieved!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This process does not need to take place directly. As Arab States join
trade organizations in which &#147;Israel&#148; is already a member, like the World Trade
Organization or the Agreement of European Partnership, impediments to trade between Arab
States and &#147;Israel&#148; are effectively removed without the political fuss that
accompanies direct agreements between &#147;Israel&#148; and Arab States. This is how we
should view the linkage between globalization and the Zionification of the Arab World.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, Arabs could reap the benefits of specialization,
mass-production and large markets by simply establishing an Arab common market, or by
joining other economic associations that do not include &#147;Israel&#148;. In fact, it is
&#147;Israel&#148; that needs the Arabs much more than the other way around.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. The movement of labour</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, the movement of labour does not mean at all allowing Arab
workers to migrate permanently to Palestine. &#147;Israel&#148; has been following the
policy of taking good advantage of cheap Palestinian-Arab labour from the lands occupied
in 1948 and 1967. Nowadays, &#147;Israel&#148; is beginning to make good use of cheap
Jordanian labour within the restrictions imposed by security considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the case of total normalization with &#147;Israel&#148;, however, large
reserves of unemployed Arab workers would become available, under the threat of
extinction, to &#147;Israeli&#148; investors across the New Middle East. Surely, some
claim that it is better to have these workers employed rather than unemployed. But it is
NOT only sub-minimal wages, like the ones paid by &#147;Israeli&#148; employers to female
workers who toil from dawn until dusk at el-Hassan industrial park in Northern Jordan,
that are of utmost concern here. What is of concern, in fact, is the establishment of a
permanent neo-colonial relationship with &#147;Israel&#148; in which Arabs sell cheap,
unskilled and semi-skilled labour to &#147;Israelis&#148; in &#147;Israel&#148; or the
Arab World, instead of pursuing an economic development plan of their own. Relieving the
pressures of Arab unemployment this way could be detrimental to the Arabs in the long run
as the economic and technological disparity grows between them and &#147;Israel&#148;.
Countries are better off exporting the goods and services that currently unemployed
workers can supply, rather than exporting the unemployed workers themselves to the
metropolis to increase the value added of the products that &#147;Israel&#148; will just
turn around to sell back to them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. The movement of capital</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Levelling all obstacles before the inflow of foreign and
&#147;Israeli&#148; capital to the Arab countries is touted as an ambitious goal by those
who think that this will turn their Arab States into another Singapore or Hong Kong! But,
in fact, capital movements worldwide are not a homogenous whole. Neither are all capital
movements devoid of political agendas. And assuming that the inflow of capital is
motivated by pure profit, where would it choose to locate itself: &#147;Israel&#148; or
the Arab States?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To begin with, the size of the &#147;Israeli&#148; economy, and hence the
&#147;Israeli&#148; market, is larger than that of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan
combined. Furthermore, the size of a market is not measured by the size of the population <i>per
se</i>, but rather by the size of the residents' average income. Henceforth,
&#147;Israeli&#148; per capita income is 12 to 20 times greater than that of the Arab
States, with the exception of a few small Emirates. The disparity in technology, advanced
industry and infrastructure between &#147;Israel&#148; and the Arab States was not bridged
by the very slow growth rates in the 1980s and the 1990s. Cheap labour in many Arab
States, on the other hand, is a necessary but insufficient condition to attract direct
foreign investment in light industry, for example. But other factors, such as the size of
a market, or the availability of a good infra-structure and a well-developed institutional
setting (such as a court system, State bureaucracy, and relevant laws) that is congenial
to business, might be just as important as cheap labour. Therefore, provided with easy
access to Arab markets from &#147;Israel&#148;, direct foreign investment is more likely
to locate in &#147;Israel&#148; to feed peripheral Arab demand rather than the other way
around.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This factor is exacerbated by the fact that skilled and highly skilled
labour is more plentiful in &#147;Israel&#148; and at a lower pay scale than in the West.
This is a decisive factor in the location decision of companies seeking to invest in the
production of technology-intensive, engineering, and computer products. Indeed, direct
foreign investment in Arab natural resources, such as oil or phosphate, might be attracted
to some Arab States. But those investments roaming for environments rich in specialized or
high-productivity inputs or for the local ability to produce high-quality, intermediate
goods that increase the value added to final output would rather head for
&#147;Israel&#148; than for the Arab States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, there is another aspect in the problem of attracting foreign
capital that many Arab and third world States don't seem to give enough attention. The
investment decisions of transnational corporations are centralized decisions that are made
on the basis of strategic considerations that have led to the generation of a new division
of labour on an international scale. Third world and Arab States have been competing to
attract foreign capital by liberalizing their economies and removing all restrictions on
free (foreign) enterprise, among other things. But the fact that these measures to
liberalize the economy have been adopted EQUALLY by most countries in the world has made
investment in more developed countries more attractive on the average. Consequently, in
spite of all these liberalization efforts, developed countries continue to receive the
lion's share of direct foreign investment worldwide, and developing countries are still
marginalized. Subsequently, the experiences of Singapore and Hong Kong, and the Asian
tigers in general are not necessarily replicable. For these economic success stories were
partially the result of Cold War considerations which led to the heavy transfer of capital
from Japan and the West into Southeast Asia to make the masses of China, Indo-China and
the Korean Peninsula marvel at the greatness of capitalism. They were also&#151;especially
in second-generation success stories like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South
Korea&#151;the result of internal factors such as careful government planning and
coordination, efficient systems to build human capital through education, and a set of
social and cultural values which emphasized saving and hard work.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another aspect of the competition to attract foreign investment in the
1990s is that it has not led to the inflow of direct foreign investment to developing
countries, but to heavy movements by short-term capital seeking to turn quick profits from
speculation, stocks, bonds, derivatives and foreign exchange. Short-term capital inflows
are not associated with beefing up the productive capacity of nations since they do not
lead to an increase in the quantity or quality of factories, farms, freeways or finished
products that a nation possesses. In fact, short-term movements of capital can cause a lot
of instability in the national economy as happened in Southeast Asia in 1997, and in
Russia and Brazil in 1999.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Opting for regional blocs in and amongst the developing countries, such as
an Arab Common Market, an African Common Market, a Latin American Common Market, and so
forth, might be easier and cheaper than restructuring the economies of the developing
countries in a European or an international framework dominated by the West and
transnational corporations. In fact, even the attraction of direct foreign investments
will be more likely within these regional blocs as they will have a larger size and
benefit from economies of scale. As for the Arab countries opening up to
&#147;Israel&#148;, even if it were non-racist and non-expansionist in the conventional
sense, the above indicates that it would multiply &#147;Israel's&#148; strength and make
it more difficult to deal with. The dynamics of this relationship will lead to
&#147;Israel&#148; becoming a leading technology-based industrial node in whose orbit Arab
peripheries revolve. This will not happen as a result of a conspiracy of any sort.
&#147;Israeli&#148; hegemony will arise out of the specific features that constitute the
points of strength of the &#147;Israeli&#148; economy today if these were given free reign
to grow unfettered at the expense of the Arab world. </p>
