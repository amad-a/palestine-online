    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Nasser Malham complained of pain. An x-ray revealed that he was suffering
    from an internal hemorrhage in the left testicle, and emergency surgery showed that the
    hemorrhage had been caused by a beating. Thus, Dr.Mahmoud Jabarin, a surgeon, summed up
    Malham's medical condition at the end of February. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Nasser Malham and his brother-in-law Ayman Malham said that Border
    Policeman beat them brutally with a flashlight and the butt of a pistol. The two
    complained through B'Tselem to the division for the investigation of police officers at
    the State Prosecutor's Office and to the military prosecutor. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">According to B'Tselem, there has been a significant rise recently in the
    number of complaints submitted by Palestinians against police, and border police in
    particular. The complaints claim to have been beaten at checkpoints, particularly the one
    at the post near Jenin. The organization says that it has received a large number of
    complaints during the months of February and March.</p>

    and Jewish denominations over homosexuality. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Before Wednesday's vote, the Unitarian church and the United Church of
    Christ--both traditionally liberal Christian denominations--were the only American
    religious bodies to formally approve having clergy officiate at same-gender unions. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">JERUSALEM-</b> Wrapping up a seven-month fraud investigation, Israeli
    police recommended today that former Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara,
    be indicted on criminal charges.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The case stems from allegations that the Netanyahus illegally kept 700
    state gifts received while he was in office that are said to be worth $100,000. Among the
    gifts were silverware, menorahs, carpets, paintings and, according to Israeli TV, a golden
    letter opener from Vice President Gore.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The inquiry has become emblematic of a series of corruption inquiries
    involving the top echelons of Israeli government and business, including President Ezer
    Weizman, the governing Labor Party and the publisher of a leading newspaper.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">WASHINGTON</b>- President Clinton, commenting publicly for the first time
    on the failure of his talks with the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, said today that it is
    up to Mr. Assad to make the next move. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The ball's in his court now, and I'm going to look forward to
    hearing from him,&quot; Mr. Clinton said at the White House before meeting with the
    Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I went to Switzerland to meet President Assad to clarify to him what
    I thought the options were and to hear from him what his needs are,&quot; Mr. Clinton
    added, &quot;and I asked him to come back to me with what he thought ought to be
    done.&quot; </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Senior administration officials continued to express disappointment today
    at the outcome of the meeting with Mr. Assad, during which he stuck to his long-held view
    that Israel should return land seized from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Since taking office in January 1997, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
    Albright has barnstormed the country from Alaska to Maine, delivering 89 speeches in 41
    cities. &quot;The thing I just love watching are teenage girls,&quot; said Barbara Larkin,
    the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, who sometimes accompanies her
    boss. &quot;They treat her like she's a rock star.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Three years ago, Albright was at the top of her game, a blunt-spoken
    former Georgetown University professor with a reputation for wearing outsize brooches and
    staring down dictators. Today her influence is much diminished, eroded by rival agencies
    and the White House and undercut by widespread criticism of her outspoken, sometimes
    schoolmarmish style.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Within the department, Albright is regarded by many career diplomats as an
    insecure and indifferent leader who is quick to anger and obsessed by her public image. </p>

    and Palestinian peace talks. </p>
