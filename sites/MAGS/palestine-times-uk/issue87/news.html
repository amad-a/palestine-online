<H3><CENTER>Palestinians Label Israeli Report &quot;Proof Of Rampant Racism&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (17 August)</B> Palestinian leaders in Israel reacted
angrily to an Israeli government report recommending that &quot;the Arabs
in Israel be viewed as a potential strategic threat to the State&quot; and
warning against &quot;growing ideological separatism&quot; among the Arab
minority.<BR>
&quot;The report comes as no surprise to us; we know all too well that Israel
is a racist State ruled by racist leaders who uphold racist laws,&quot;
said Talab al Sani'e, a Knesset member and co-founder of the Arab Democratic
Party.<BR>
Al Sani'e pointed out that the Zionist State was still treating the Arabs
who make up 20% of the population as &quot;neutralized enemies who must
be kept dormant.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The maxim goes all over the world that a person is innocent until
proven guilty, here the opposite is true, an Arab is guilty until proven
innocent.&quot;<BR>
Al Sani'e stressed that democracy in the Zionist State was &quot;selective&quot;
and &quot;only really confined to Jews.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Zionism rejects the concept of equality between Jews and non-Jews,
hence democracy becomes anathema for the Zionists if and when non-Jews living
in a Jewish State enjoy its fruits.&quot;<BR>
The disclosure of the report, published in the Hebrew paper Ma'ariv on 16
August, was also castigated by Ibrahim Nimre Hussein, the mayor of the Arab
town of Shafa Amre in Galilee.<BR>
&quot;This is very disquieting, indeed. It shows that Israeli leaders speak
about equality and co-existence in public and plot evil designs against
us in secret.&quot;<BR>
Amre, who heads the National Committee of Arab Local Councils in the Zionist
State, added that the Arabs, 1 million strong, would not be scared by the
release of this report.<BR>
&quot;By disclosing the report, the Israeli authorities meant to warn us
to lower our heads and to desist from demanding equality, but we are not
going to keep a low profile because we were here before they came to Palestine.&quot;<BR>
Sheikh Ra'ed Salah, mayor of the Arab town of Um al Fahem, also lambasted
the report.<BR>
&quot;The report reflects the diabolical thinking of those who prepared
it and subscribe to its sinister recommendations. If it is designed to scare
us, we are not going to be scared. We will continue to be proud of our Arab/Muslim
heritage and we will not be assimilated.&quot; <BR>
Salah, whom the report names as the most anti-Israeli figure in the Arab
community, described the report as &quot;a tacit message of intimidation&quot;
to the Islamic movement in Israel.<BR>
&quot;Mostly, the Zionist establishment would like to see the Arabs either
as drug addicts or construction labourers; the idea of Arabs reverting to
Islam and regaining their personal and national dignity is unbearable for
most Zionists.&quot;<BR>
The report, which was prepared by high-ranking policy makers in the Prime
Minister's office, was the first official document of its kind since the
establishment of the Zionist State in Palestine in 1948.<BR>
It quoted intelligence officials as saying &quot;Arabs are on their way
to demanding cultural, educational, institutional and eventually political
autonomy.&quot;<BR>
Moreover, the report warned the Israeli Government to &quot;pay more attention
to this growing threat.&quot;<BR>
The report made the following recommendations:<BR>
1. Indoctrinating Arab children in Jewish and Zionist values in order to
guarantee Arab loyalty to the State.<BR>
2. Finding a &quot;balance of interests&quot; besides &quot;the balance
of terror.&quot;<BR>
3. Making the &quot;symbols of the Jewishness of the State&quot; more conspicuous
throughout the Arab community, e.g. making refusal to show esteem for the
flag of the State a criminal offense.<BR>
4. Placing a ban on polygamy among the Muslim population in order to prevent
the Arab population from increasing to undesirable proportions.<BR>
5. Preventing &quot;Israeli Muslims&quot; from carrying out any &quot;political,
religious activities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&quot;<BR>
6. Stepping up police presence in Arab towns and villages.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Fatah Leaders In Hebron: Arafat Is Destroying The Movement</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Hebron - PT</B><BR>
Leaders of Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction, have lambasted their leader,
PA Chairman Yasser Arafat, for &quot;embarking on dangerous policies that
could corrode Fatah popularity and eventually destroy the movement.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The Palestinian Authority has made one fiasco after the other...It
has been a colossal failure in every perceivable aspect, and Fatah will
bear the consequences,&quot; said Abbas Zaki, a member of the Legislative
Council and of the PLO Central Committee, during a seminar on the new Palestinian
cabinet in Dura on 17 August.<BR>
Zaki admitted that Fatah already lost much of the support it had once commanded,
saying the movement was being reduced to one person, Yasser Arafat.<BR>
Zaki, who is in charge of the Fatah organizational department, pointed out
that Arafat was the real force behind the rampant corruption in the Palestinian
Authority.<BR>
&quot;He knows well the corrupt ministers who stole millions upon million
of the people's money; he provided a cover-up for the corruption and the
corrupt,&quot; said Zaki, amid loud cheers from an audience of 500 mostly
Fatah activists.<BR>
Zaki also suggested that &quot;sincere sons of Fatah cooperate with our
brothers in Hamas for the common good of our country and people.&quot;<BR>
This suggestion is likely to be rejected by Arafat since such a cooperation
would undermine Arafat's virtual autocracy.<BR>
Aziz Amre, who participated in the Madrid Peace conference and is now &quot;governor&quot;
in the PA Interior Ministry, accused the PA administration of &quot;endangering
the integrity and the credibility of Fatah before the people in its own
eyes.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The main victim of this absurd spectacle with which we have been affronted
for the last two years is first and foremost Fatah,&quot; said Amre in response
to Nabil Amre (his cousin), who has assumed the newly-designated portfolio
of &quot;Minister for Parliamentary Affairs.&quot;<BR>
Minister Amre spoke apologetically about the new PA cabinet, saying, &quot;we
have to remind ourselves that we are in Palestine and the Arab world, not
in Sweden or in Finland.&quot;<BR>
&quot;We shouldn't look at the fledgling Legislative Council in the same
way we view the British House of Commons...We are only four years old.&quot;<BR>
Amre, never the less, recognized that &quot;we always collide with the president,&quot;
alluding that Arafat is the main obstacle impeding serious democratic reform
in the Palestinian Authority.<BR>
Amre's apologetic tune was not received well by the suspecting audience.<BR>
One Fatah activist urged Amre to resign immediately from the new PA cabinet
if he was interested in a second term as Member of Parliament.<BR>
All in all, Amre evaded many critical questions pertaining to the stalled
peace process and corruption, bribery, nepotism and favouritism and lack
of accountability that are rampant throughout the PA administrative apparatus.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Palestinians Condemn American Strikes On Sudan And Afghanistan</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>Occupied Jerusalem (21 August)</B> In contrast to the Palestinian Authority
leadership, which issued a laconic reaction to U.S. cruise missile attacks
on &quot;suspected terrorist targets&quot; in Sudan and Afghanistan late
Thursday, most ordinary Palestinians reacted angrily to the strikes, describing
them as &quot;State terrorism&quot; and as a &quot;signal of open confrontation
between Islam and American imperialism.&quot;<BR>
Angry Palestinians took to the streets on Friday, 21 August, to protest
American aggression, setting the American flag on fire and vowing to continue
the struggle against the Great Satan.<BR>
&quot;This is a naked aggression and arrogance of power,&quot; said Ahmed
Abu Sirhan, a taxi cab driver from Bethlehem, adding that &quot;this heralds
the return of the law of the jungle to the world.&quot;<BR>
Abu Sirhan, like most Palestinians and Arabs, believes U.S. President Bill
Clinton ordered the attack on Khartoum and the alleged terrorist camps in
Afghanistan mainly to &quot;divert attention from his domestic troubles.&quot;<BR>
&quot;This should be called operation Monica,&quot; said Abu Sirhan, getting
approval from passengers traveling with him.<BR>
However, Islamic Friday speakers in the West Bank were less concerned with
the &quot;wag the dog&quot; theory and more with &quot;this criminal attack
on the sovereign soils of two Muslim countries.&quot;<BR>
Hamas founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in a speech marking the fire that gutted
parts of Al Masjidul Al Aqsa in 1969, held the American Government responsible
for &quot;creating an atmosphere of hate for America among Muslims all over
the world.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Muslims don't want to be an enemy to America; it is America that is
presenting itself as an enemy to Islam and Muslims.<BR>
Yassin scoffed at U.S. President Bill Clinton's assertion that &quot;the
terrorists target America because they don't like democracy and freedom.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Clinton knows quite well that the root cause behind Arab and Muslim
hostility toward American is the latter's unlimited and excessive support
for Zionist aggression against Muslims in Palestine.&quot;<BR>
Moreover, the Islamist leader opined that &quot;the way to hurt America
is to hit the Zionists in Palestine.&quot;<BR>
Awni Yousef, a professor of political science at Bir Zeit University, also
believes that Clinton misled the American people and the world concerning
the strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.<BR>
&quot;Clinton is deliberately refusing to admit that American foreign policy
in the Middle East is the reason behind the Muslim masses' hatred for everything
American,&quot; said Yousef.<BR>
&quot;Mostly the masses in much of the Muslim world view their despotic
leaders as puppets that are responsible to the White House more than they
are to their own peoples, hence when they direct their anger at the United
States, they actually do so at their rulers vicariously.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>Seventeen Palestinian journalists blacklisted for<BR>
normalizing with the Zionists</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem - PT</B><BR>
The Cairo-based Arab Journalists Union (AJU) decided unanimously to boycott
Palestinian and other Arab journalists indulging in &quot;normalizing activities
with the Zionist enemy,&quot; said the head of the Palestinian journalists
union, Na'im Tubasi, who took part in the latest AJU meeting that was held
in Alexandria, Egypt, last week.<BR>
Tubasi said the AJU reiterated its earlier position against &quot;all forms
of normalizing with the Zionist enemy.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The AJU views the issue of normalization with paramount gravity since
it is an integral part of the ongoing conflict with Israel.&quot;<BR>
Tubasi said the AJU called, in its final communiqu&eacute;, on all Arab
journalist unions to &quot;immediately terminate all ties with the Zionists
and to boycott all (Arab) journalists indulging in any form of normalization
with the Zionist enemy.&quot;<BR>
The AJU reportedly demanded that the Palestinian journalists union, headed
by Tubasi, eject as many as 17 Palestinian journalists and writers who last
month took part in a &quot;normalization forum&quot; in Greece, attended
by a large Zionist delegation including journalists, politicians and even
intelligence officers.<BR>
The Palestinian journalists, who were encouraged to attend the forum by
high-ranking officials in the Palestinian Authority, reportedly took part
in &quot;promiscuous events&quot; in bars and nightclubs, which drew indignant
reactions from many Palestinian journalists and from the AJU.<BR>
Tawfik Abu Khusa, member of the Palestinian union who also participated
in the AJU meeting in Alexandria, said the Palestinian union would take
&quot;stringent measures against Palestinian journalists who participated
in the normalization forum in Greece.&quot;<BR>
Abu Khusa said the participation in the forum &quot;amounted to treachery&quot;
since the question of normalization is &quot;the last defense line against
Zionist hegemony.&quot;<BR>
In addition to the 17 journalists attending the forum, several Palestinian
leaders took part, including the PLO official in Jerusalem (Faisal Husseini),
Legislative Council member Ziad abu Ziad, and a number of officials from
the PA Ministry of Culture.<BR>
The participation by Palestinian officials and journalists in &quot;normalization
activities&quot; with the Zionists is a stark contrast with the constant
calls by PA chairman Yasser Arafat for ending all forms of normalization
with Israel.<BR>
Last week, prominent PLO officials attended a concert in Nablus hosting
the famous Zionist singer, Zahava Ben, known for her hits glorifying the
Zionist army.<BR>
Among PLO figures attending the concert were Ghassan al Shaka'a, member
of the PLO Executive Committee, and the governor of Nablus, Mahmoud al Alul.<BR>
Observers have noticed lately that the PA has been the main force behind
normalization with the Zionists, in contrast to public statements and rhetoric
to the contrary.<BR>
The main proponent of &quot;normalization&quot; is Mahmoud Abbas (abu Mazen),
who reportedly advocates &quot;blending into the Israeli society regardless
of the peace process.&quot;<BR>
Abu Mazen is the heir apparent of Yasser Arafat, and many believe he will
be imposed on the Palestinian people by Israel, the United States, and some
colluding Arab regimes.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Israeli Occupation army destroys seven Arab homes</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem-PT </B><BR>
Israeli army bulldozers demolished on 19 August seven Palestinian homes
in the village of al-Samuo, 20 miles southwest of Hebron, bringing the number
of destroyed Arab houses since the beginning of 1998 to 146, according to
reliable sources.<BR>
Ghazi Abu Hammad, head of the al Samuo's local council, said Israeli army
bulldozers were brought early in the morning on Wednesday, 19 August, to
the southern outskirts of the village, escorted by several army trucks.<BR>
&quot;Soon they gave the inhabitants of the slated homes a 30-minute grace
period to get their belongings out or else the houses would be destroyed
on their heads.&quot;<BR>
Abu Hammad said the soldiers threatened to shoot-to-kill anybody seeking
to stop the bulldozers; they told us they had orders to carry out and we'd
better stay away and keep silent.&quot;<BR>
The seven homes sheltered 63 men, women and children who have now become
homeless.<BR>
An Israeli army spokesperson claimed the homes were destroyed because they
had been built without proper licensing.<BR>
However, the proprietor of one of the demolished homes, Mohammed al Maharik,
disputed the Israeli claim, describing it as &quot;a cheap excuse.&quot;<BR>
Al Maharik pointed out that the Zionist occupation authorities adopt &quot;house
demolition&quot; as an established policy designed to prevent Arab demographic
expansion.<BR>
&quot;They want to keep us confined to our villages,&quot; al Maharik said.<BR>
On Tuesday, 18 August, the Zionist authorities demolished one house at the
village of Katanna, southwest of Jerusalem.<BR>
The destruction of Arab homes, say human rights activists, has assumed &quot;phenomenal
proportions&quot; since Benyamin Netanyahu came to power in the mid of 1996.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Clinton's Sex Scam Likely To Affect M.E. Peace Process</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Khalid Amayreh</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (19 August)</B> Even before his admission to having
had an adulterous relationship with Monica Lewinsky, U.S. President Bill
Clinton had been manifestly reluctant to exert pressure on the extremist
Zionist Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to be more forthcoming with the
Palestinians.<BR>
Now, a scandal-ridden and a much-weakened Clinton is likely to display even
more weakness and indecision toward the deadlocked peace process between
the Jewish State and the Palestinian Authority.<BR>
According to Ziad Abu Amre, a former Professor of Political Science and
now a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the &quot;Clinton-Lewinsky
scam&quot; will definitely have a negative impact on the peace process in
the Middle East.<BR>
&quot;Clinton will mostly be inward-looking now. He won't have the audacity
to put up an effective leadership in the world arena as he will have to
busy himself repairing and salvaging his political life at home.&quot;<BR>
Abu Amre opined that it was even more unlikely that the Clinton administration
would exert meaningful pressure on the current Israeli Government.<BR>
Never the less, Abu Amre pointed out that the United States would still
prevent Europe from assuming a primary role in the Middle East peace process.<BR>
&quot;The Americans would only like any European role to be complementary
and secondary to the American role,&quot; said Abu Amre.<BR>
So far, Palestinian Authority officials have refused to publicly comment
on Clinton's address on 18 August in which he confessed to having had &quot;a
relationship that is not appropriate...and wrong with Monica Lewinsky.&quot;<BR>
However, in a rather laconic statement to the press, PA chairman Yasser
Arafat said on 18 August that he hoped that the Monica Lewinsky affair would
have a minimal effect on the peace process.<BR>
Arafat repeatedly praised Clinton as &quot;a friend of the Palestinian people&quot;
and &quot;a man of moral credibility.&quot;<BR>
Never the less, the ordinary Palestinian man in the street does not hesitate
to call a spade a spade.<BR>
&quot;Clinton is an adulterous man...It is lamentable that so many Arab
leaders readily give him obedience,&quot; said a Jerusalem vegetable vendor
after watching Clinton's address on TV.<BR>
Another Palestinian, a Hebron taxi driver, scoffed at the fact that &quot;we
in Palestine and elsewhere in the Arab-Muslim world will be held hostage
to Clinton's prurient desires.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>Hundreds of college students protest Israeli maltreatment</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Ramallah, West Bank (17 August)</B> Hundreds of Palestinian and foreign
students demonstrated on 17 August against the sinister Israeli policy of
barring Gaza's college students from traveling to their universities in
the West Bank.<BR>
The protesters, who included students from the United States and Western
Europe, carried placards reading &quot;yes to freedom of education,&quot;
&quot;no to apartheid&quot; and &quot;education is a right not a crime.&quot;<BR>
When they arrived at the Israeli army roadblock, known as the al Ram Checkpoint,
some of the protesters, including some foreigners, were beaten and dragged
to the ground by heavily armed Israeli soldiers. <BR>
Fatima Ismael, a Bir Zeit University student who took part in the protest,
pointed out that the Israeli occupation authorities were treating Palestinians
as &quot;sub-humans...not very much different from the way the Nazis treated
the Jews in Europe in the late 1930s and early 1940s.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Not only do they (the Zionists) want to kill our will to resist their
satanic occupation and domination, they also want to rob us of the right
to an education.&quot;<BR>
The Palestinian student also pointed out that the draconian Israeli measures
against college students in general and Gaza students in particular ruined
the future of many students who had hoped to obtain a college education.<BR>
&quot;They often wait until a given student is three years through the college
and needs only one year to graduate. At this point they put him or her on
the blacklist and bar the student from reaching his or her college.&quot;<BR>
Another protester, Yousef Mansur from Hebron, complained that the Zionists
were seeking to push as many Palestinian college students to leave the country
in the hope that they would not return home for good.<BR>
&quot;Their sinister goal is very clear. They want to push us to immigrate
so that they could have the land,&quot; said Mansur.<BR>
Hanan Ashrawi, the former Palestinian minister of Higher Education who participated
in the protest, said the Zionist occupation authorities were targeting college
students deliberately in order to &quot;keep Palestinian society in perpetual
inferiority vis-a-vis the Zionists.&quot;<BR>
Ashrawi pointed out that the PA made strenuous efforts to convince the Zionists
to mitigate their draconian restrictions on student travel to and from the
Gaza Strip, but to no avail.<BR>
Travel between Gaza and the West Bank became very difficult after the conclusion
of the Oslo accords and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority that
ordinary Gazans who do not carry a VIP card are often forced to travel to
Egypt and on to Jordan in order to get back to the West Bank.<BR>
The West Bank is only 40 kilometres away from Gaza.<BR>
So far, Israel and the Self-rule Authority have failed to reach an agreement
on the &quot;safe passage&quot; between Gaza and the West Bank.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Hebron is under curfew following slaying of settler</CENTER></H3>

<P>Hebron, the second largest town in the West Bank, has been under curfew
since the 21 August fatal stabbing of a Jewish settler at the site of Tel
al Rumeida in the middle of the town. Palestinian sources pointed out that
Israeli soldiers prevented schoolchildren, even kindergartners, from going
to their schools. Saturday (22 August) was the first day of the scholastic
year for as many as 840,000 Palestinian pupils. Furthermore, the city itself
remained isolated as Israeli occupation soldiers erected roadblocks barring
traffic to and from Hebron. The slain settler, a rabbi named Shlomo Ra'anan,
was an extremist member of the Gush Emunim movement which calls for the
expulsion or annihilation of Arabs in Palestine and advocates the establishment
of &quot;Greater Israel&quot;, which would extend from the Nile to the Euphrates
and encompass parts of Turkey and the Arabian Peninsula. Ra'anan was the
grandchild of Abraham Cook, the founder of Gush Emunim, who sought to blend
the Jewish religion into secular Zionism. <BR>
The killing of the settler, if indeed it was carried out by a Palestinian
fighter, signals a resumption of armed Palestinian struggle against Israeli
military and settler targets. It also underscores Palestinian disenchantment
with the paralyzed peace process. Interestingly, the PA leadership has not
condemned the incident as it always did when similar attacks on Israeli
targets were carried out. PA silence drew anger from the Zionist Prime Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu, who reportedly urged PA Chairman Yasser Arafat to &quot;publicly
and openly condemn the murder.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>Zionists to erase Arab village</CENTER></H3>

<P>The Jerusalem-based Hebrew daily, Kol Ha'er, has reported that the Israeli
Government has endorsed a plan to erase the Arab village of Lifta, located
on the northwestern outskirts of Jerusalem and which was occupied in 1948.
Most of the original houses in the village remain intact, but its nearly
5,000 Arab inhabitants were expelled to neighbouring Arab localities eastward.<BR>
The Israeli paper quoted a &quot;reliable source&quot; at the Ministry of
National Infrastructure, now headed by the hawkish former war minister Ariel
Sharon, as saying that &quot;a modern neighbourhood will be established
on the site of the Arab village.&quot; The planned obliteration of Lifta
is consistent with the adopted Israeli policy of demographic and ethnic
cleansing that has been employed against the Palestinian people. As many
as 500 Arab villages were almost completely obliterated by the Zionists
in 1948 and the two successive decades.</P>

<H3><CENTER>PA attacks Hamas spokesman for opposing PA State</CENTER></H3>

<P>PA-affiliated media have lashed out at Ibrahim Gosheh, Hamas spokesperson
in Amman, Jordan, for voicing opinions critical of a prospective tiny Palestinian
State in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Gosheh was quoted as
saying on Tuesday, 18 August, that a Palestinian State in parts of the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip would not be viable and would be wholly dependent
on Israel. He reportedly favoured an integrative unity between Jordan and
the West Bank, provided that this is determined through a free and democratic
election in Jordan and the occupied territories. The Palestinian radio station
(Voice of Palestine), a mouthpiece for Yasser Arafat, scoffed at Gosheh,
describing him as &quot;hostile to Palestinian aspirations.&quot; The Islamist
ideology, which is adopted by Hamas, calls for the integration of all Arab
and Muslim countries into an Islamic State ruled by the laws of Shariah
(Islamic jurisprudence). In contrast, the secular and staunchly nationalist
PLO considers the establishment of a Palestinian State anywhere in Palestine
as a paramount goal.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Preventive Security embezzled $2.5 million from taxpayers</CENTER></H3>

<P>The Preventive Security Force (PSF) reportedly forcibly extorted around
8 million NIS from Palestinian taxpayers, especially businessmen and contractors,
in the Hebron area, using illegal means, including torture and imprisonment.
Moreover, instead of handing the money over to the PA treasury, the PSF
leaders reportedly kept the money for themselves. The Palestinian Human
Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) held a press conference in Jerusalem on
20 August during which some of the victims related their ordeal at the hands
of the PSF. PHRMG director, Bassem Eid, said the latest revelation was a
double crime: extortion and embezzlement. For its part, the PSF rejected
Eid's accusations, accusing him of being &quot;a Zionist enemy.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>840,000 pupils back to school after summer holiday</CENTER></H3>

<P>Around 840,000 Palestinian schoolchildren returned to school on Saturday,
22 August, after the summer holiday. The Minister of Education, Yasser Amer,
resigned from his post in the latest PA cabinet reshuffle. Yasser Arafat
is now the acting Minister of Education. The public education system in
the autonomous enclaves has been in a dire situation since the PA assumed
control over it four years ago. An average Palestinian teacher's salary,
for example, does not exceed $300 per month. When teachers sought to protest
their grievances last year, Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajoub called
them &quot;a fifth column&quot; and actually arrested some of them &quot;for
endangering national security.&quot;</P>

<P>Salah al Ta'amari, a Palestinian Legislative Council member who Yasser

accept the new post. Al Ta'amari refused on 17 August to take the constitutional

from his new cabinet several ministers accused of embezzling large sums
of public money. Two other ministers resigned in protest-Higher Education
Minister Hanan Ashrawi and Agriculture Minister Abdul Jawad Saleh.</P>

<P>&quot;Casino al Waha&quot; or &quot;the Oasis&quot; will be opened in
Jericho in December, Palestinian sources close to chief proprietor Yasser
Arafat's economic advisor, Muhammad Rashid, said on 17 August. The mainly
gambling facility has cost around $150 million, drawing scathing criticisms
from Palestinian circles and international donors. Religious and civic leaders
in the West Bank accused the PA of &quot;being insensitive to the feelings
of our people&quot; and &quot;of endangering our social and moral fabric
by erecting this den of vice in the middle of Jericho.&quot; The casino
was built on land belonging to the Islamic Wakf as protests by Palestinian
Wakf authorities were disregarded by Rashid and Arafat.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Water shortage in West Bank reaches crisis proportions</CENTER></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (11 August) </B>Many Palestinians in the West
  Bank have been literally thirsty this summer simply because there is little
  or no water to drink. The serious shortage in drinking water, now felt
  almost in each and every Palestinian locality, is attributed mainly to
  the racist Israeli policy of pumping the lion's share of the West Bank's
  increasingly scarce drinking water to Jewish settlements, leaving the bulk
  of Palestinians in the throes of the most severe water crisis ever.<BR>
  The crisis is felt all over the occupied territories, particularly in the
  southern parts of the West Bank, such as Bethlehem and Hebron, where entire
  towns and neighbourhoods have gone literally thirsty.<BR>
  According to Hebron mayor, Mustafa Abdul Nabi al Natshe, the water crisis
  has become &quot;a paramount issue&quot; for Palestinians in the West Bank.
  <BR>
  &quot;We may be able to stay alive without a Palestinian State with Jerusalem
  as its capital, but we can't possibly live without water because water
  is life,&quot; complained Natshe in a recent interview, alluding to the
  utter powerlessness of the Palestinian Authority to make water available
  for the population.<BR>
  Natshe pointed out that the Oslo peace process has exacerbated the water
  shortage by many folds.<BR>
  &quot;Before the establishment of the PA, we used to leave no stone unturned
  until the Israeli authorities turned the faucet on. Now, however, Yasser
  Arafat is responsible for the water and he doesn't control the tap, and
  therefore can't do anything to solve the problem.&quot;<BR>
  Natshe is right. <BR>
  The Oslo agreement gave Israel complete control over water sources, thus
  trusting Palestinian lives to Israeli &quot;mercy and magnanimity.&quot;<BR>
  The mayor's words, never the less, say many Palestinians, don't reflect
  sufficiently the depth of the crisis and its potential disastrous prospects
  for Palestinians.<BR>
  Indeed, some Palestinians have begun to use terms such as &quot;genocide&quot;
  and &quot;annihilation&quot; to describe the racist Israeli policy on water.<BR>
  These descriptions acquire particular credence when one compares the virtual
  drought in some Palestinian towns and neighbourhoods to the humid, merry
  atmosphere at Jewish settlements nearby, where the sight of settler youngsters
  swimming playfully in large pools surrounded by green lawns with heavy-pressure
  garden sprinklers spouting out water in all directions.<BR>
  &quot;I don't see any differences between the Zionists and the Nazis; they
  seem to believe that they deserve life, since they think they are God's
  chosen people, and we deserve death. What else explains this racism on
  their part?&quot; said Husam Jaba'ari, as he was watching water gushing
  from a row of sprinklers at Kiryat Araba'a, only 25 metres from &quot;the
  no-water zone&quot;-his home.<BR>
  The stark dichotomy of virtual drought verses spouting sprinklers originates
  in the scandalous obliquity in the amounts of water given to Jews and Arabs.<BR>
  According to Taher Naser al Din, the head of the PA Water Department in
  the West Bank, a Jewish settler receives an average of seven to eight times
  the amount of water given to a Palestinian, forcing thirsty Palestinians
  to seek water from surface, and often contaminated, wells.<BR>
  According to the Oslo Accords, the Israeli occupation authorities not only
  retained absolute and ultimate control over the tap, they also have the
  final say in all matters pertaining to underground water in all parts of
  the West Bank, including the areas nominally under PA control, e.g. the
  seven Palestinian towns run by the PA.<BR>
  For example, the Oslo accords stipulated that Palestinians &quot;have no
  right to drill wells exceeding 14 metres in depth.&quot; Indeed, in many
  instances, Israeli occupation soldiers intervened with force to stop Palestinians
  from drilling artesian wells in their own towns in the full view of PA
  police who can only look on.<BR>
  Predictably, the result is thirst and frustration, and more thirst and
  more frustration.<BR>
  In numerous villages in the West Bank, the unsightly scene of women and
  young children drawing water from contaminated wells dating back to the
  Ottoman era defies description. <BR>
  Indeed, many Palestinian villagers now wish for the return of the direct
  Israeli occupation on the premise that the Zionists would at least &quot;give
  us water to drink.&quot;<BR>
  The problem doesn't stop right there. Drinking water that is contaminated
  with all kinds of microorganisms causes illness. Hence, hundreds of children
  are taken to hospitals for treatment of all sorts of maladies resulting
  from drinking contaminated water.<BR>
  Moreover, the water shortage forces most Palestinians to ration water consumption,
  thus using most of the available water for drinking, and increasingly less
  and less for other uses.<BR>
  In the face of this problem, the PA only demonstrates powerlessness and
  impotence.<BR>
  &quot;When we go to Yasser Arafat and beg him to press the Israelis to
  get us some water to drink, he gets angry and tells us 'I've got more important
  matters to deal with' and that is it,&quot; said the head of the Water
  Department in Dura.<BR>
  He added, with a shrug reflecting growing disillusionment, that &quot;when
  we go too far in our protests at the shortage of water, the PA turns the
  matter into political opposition to Arafat, and accuse us of lack of patriotism.&quot;<BR>
  Arafat's reported exasperation with thirsty Palestinians encapsulates the
  grave sins of the Oslo accords and its potential catastrophic consequences
  for Palestinians.<BR>
  The ill-reputed agreement left the vital water issue to the so-called final
  status talks, along with such subjects as the status of Jerusalem, the
  borders and the refugees.<BR>
  Now, the Palestinians, especially those who can't afford to buy mineral
  water, are bearing the full brunt of Arafat's folly. <BR>
  This is the bad thing.<BR>
  The worse is that the future could be even more ominous, especially if
  Oslo is allowed to evolve to its prime objective. There will be the real
  tragedy.</P>
