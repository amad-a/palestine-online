<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Another Zionist Massacre Uncovered</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 19 January, a young Israeli historian, working on his Masters degree,
uncovered credible evidence showing that the Israeli army slaughtered as many as 200
Palestinians in a small village near Haifa on the very day the Jewish State came into
existence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The academic, Teddy Katz, reportedly obtained extensive testimonies from
eyewitnesses, survivors and soldiers who actually took part in the carnage, and concluded
that the massacre of Tantura (population 1,530 in 1948) was larger than the notorious Deir
Yassin massacre. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;From the numbers, this is definitely one of the biggest massacres;
the killing spree in Tantura was more tragic and bigger than in the village of Deir
Yassin&#148;, Katz said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Palestinian survivor, Fawzi Tanji, now 73, and a refugee at one of the
West Bank refugee camps, was quoted by Reuters as saying that he saw Israeli soldiers line
up villagers and shoot them in ways resembling summary executions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I was 21 years old then. They took a group of 10 men, lined them up
against the cemetery wall and killed them. Then they brought another group, killed them,
threw away the bodies and so on.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tanji, who had worked until May 1948 as a guard for the British Mandate
army, added that &#147;I was waiting for my turn to die in cold blood as I saw the men
drop in front of me.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said the wholesale slaughter stopped when a Jew from the nearby
settlement of Zichron Yaacov arrived at the scene, took out a pistol and threatened to
shoot himself unless the soldiers stopped the executions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked by an Arab reporter why he had kept silent for 50 years, Tanji
replied, &#147;We told the story of what happened so many times, but nobody would listen
to us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Katz said 14 Israeli soldiers were killed in the attack on Tantura,
ostensibly when some villagers, armed with old rifles, sought desperately to defend
themselves in the face of impending extermination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The man who led the assault was quoted as saying the high toll of victims
was the result of war and that reports of a massacre were &#147;just tales.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his famous book, <i>All that Remains</i>, Walid Khalidi quoted Israeli
historians as saying that &#147;it is clear that the Alexandroni commanders (the Third
Battalion of the Alexandroni Brigade which carried out the assault) wanted the village
emptied of its inhabitants and that at least some of them were expelled.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khalidi also mentioned a New York Times report on the events at Tantura,
published on 23 May 1948, in which an Israeli military communique stated that
&#147;hundreds of Arabs and a large quantity of booty fell into our hands.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tantura was subsequently bulldozed, as were hundreds of Palestinian
villagers, and only a few masonry houses, a fortress, a shrine and an ancient well were
spared. And also in 1948, Zionist immigrants from the United States and Poland established
the Kibbutz of Nachshlim northeast of the site of Tantura. The site itself has been turned
into an Israeli recreational area complete with swimming facilities. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Refugee cause revived?</b><br>
The belated but important revelation drew little, if any, reaction from the Israeli
political establishment (the last thing the Israeli government would want to see now is
the breathing of a new life into the enduring cause of the refugees). Likewise, the
Palestinian Authority made virtually no comment on the subject, unlike the Palestinian
media, which highlighted the report and made numerous interviews with survivors. A likely
explanation for this is that PA Chairman Yasser Arafat does not want to upset Israeli
Prime Minister Barak in the midst of talks aimed at reaching a framework agreement on the
final settlement by mid-February.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The revelation does add credence and authenticity to Palestinian claims
that the bulk of Palestinian refugees were expelled by the Israeli forces, e.g. the
paramilitary organizations such as the Hagana, and not simply chose to leave their towns
and villages as the official Israeli narration had maintained all along.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the revelation coincides with an increase in warnings among
Palestinians in the occupied territories, and especially among refugees in the Diaspora,
against accepting a solution or an arrangement that does not include repatriation of
refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They themselves (Israelis) are saying they had expelled us from our
homeland in 1948; therefore, no further evidence is needed to establish and confirm our
right to repatriation,&#148; one refugee, a neighbour of Tanji, remarked on the
revelation.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></font><font size="4" color="#FF0000">New Israeli Pullback:The Most <br>
Dangerous Palestinian Concession</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ramzy Baroud </em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Military base by military base, Israel is pulling back from 5% of the West
Bank to be handed over thereafter to PA forces. And with each spot cleared from the
departing Israeli soldiers, Palestinian flags take over and waves of young and old
Palestinians, joined by police, gather, dance the dabkah, wave a flag or two, and leave
with the sweet taste of victory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, however, what may appear to be another triumph cultivated
through peace talks, contains an Israeli victory and symbolizes Palestinian negotiators
inability to achieve what has already been determined in past agreements. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli negotiator is no super man; there are reasons for the weakness
of the Palestinian team, and they are indeed many. The 5 January withdrawal was due 15
November. A disagreement, however, rose after Israel insisted, as always, on implementing
its own interpretation of the agreement. Palestinians, who asserted that the areas where
Israelis proposed to clear were not of strategic value for movement in the West Bank,
hoped for a compromise. Fifty days later, no compromise was made; Israel pulled out of the
same areas it proposed; Palestinians cheered for the pull-out and claimed a victory, and
the U.S. commended both parties for their patience and wisdom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The agreement which paved the way for the withdrawal, to please the
Palestinian side momentarily, contained a promise in which Israelis would be open to
Palestinian requests in sketching the map for the proposed 20 January Israeli redeployment
of an additional 6.1% of the West Bank. Throughout the years, Palestinians have learned
not to believe in Israel&#146;s promises and the latter was convinced of the same. Yet,
the Palestinian agreement based on an empty promise was in fact motivated by fear of
Israel&#146;s ability to neglect them, focusing solely on the Syrian negotiation front. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Time and again, PA leaders have stressed their rejection of Israel&#146;s
intentional delay in the negotiations with the Palestinians. While Israel is willing and
able to afford delay (delay for Israel means draining Palestinians&#146; patience,
cultivating thereafter more and more concessions), the PA simply cannot delay, as social
dissatisfaction is on a steady rise and the economic situation is suffering terribly. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By 13 February, both sides pledged to formulate a framework for a final
peace treaty. The chief Israeli negotiator, Oded Eran, who spoke with enthusiasm that the
13-20 February framework can be met, uttered that if an agreement was not reached by
mid-February, then it would happen only a few weeks later. The relaxed Israeli mentality
has been a very successful tool in weakening the Palestinians&#146; who are aware of the
political and social consequences that further delays could lead to. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aside from their fear of Israel&#146;s deliberate obstacles, Palestinians
are also aware that their refusal to sign on Israel&#146;s interpretation of the agreement
puts little pressure on the Israeli government. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Assuming that the deadlock in the talks lasts much more than 50 days, what
harm would that do to Israel? Israel is indeed the excusable one in any case. After all,
its security is the one recognized internationally as being under constant threat. And,
after all, they are the ones enduring the hardship of negotiating with two parties at
once. For Palestinians, without a strong international resolution to oblige Israel, or the
lack of a mechanism to implement any resolutions, and with the soft American perception of
Israel and harsh treatment of Palestinians, waiting means nothing but wasting time. Thus,
it comes as no surprise that 50 days later, Palestinians break under Israeli pressure. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the one-sided peace compromise has often been repeated, the
latest Palestinian compromise is a dangerous one. Both sides are only one withdrawal away
from formulating the final status peace treaty. The recent Palestinian concession has sent
another reassuring message to Israel that Palestinians are still vulnerable, fragile,
defenseless and, as always, ready to crack. Yet bargaining for the 5% or the 6.1%
withdrawal will not be as consequential as compromising with the future of Jerusalem,
refugees&#146; right of return, water, settlements and borders. The failure of the PA to
obtain a meaningful agreement means the creation of the same similar unjust circumstances
that led to popular Palestinian revolts in the past. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Saying &#147;no&#148; to an unjust agreement is not enough for
Palestinians to convince Israel to grant them their wishes. However, the fact that
Palestinians possess little more than their rejection of Israel&#146;s unfair negotiations
makes &#147;no&#148; the only option available. And in the midst of a difficult reality
that surrounds Palestinians, whether it be Arab fragmentation or Israel&#146;s political
influences, patience and endurance backed by national unity just might compose a long-term
winning strategy.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Criticism is a Sign of Strength, Not Weakness</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ray Hanania*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In American politics, guilt is usually associated with how an elected or
government official reacts to public charges of corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the official reacts by cracking down on the critics, as often does
happen in corrupt local towns and cities, it is usually a good bet that the official doing
the cracking down is as guilty as sin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the official brushes off the criticism with a challenge to &#147;prove
it&#148;, the public usually ignores the criticism and sides with the person being
attacked.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a truism of politics in America, which is the roughest and toughest
of any place in the world. Civilization has not polished off the greed that motivates many
Americans to seek public office.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And so it is with great sadness that I witness Yasser Arafat reacting like
a guilty man to charges that he has permitted corruption to flourish under his tenure as
PA President.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s sad because the accusation is coupled with more partisan
political charges challenging the seeming ineffectiveness of the peace process and the
Oslo Accords. The politics is easy to brush off. The people making the assertions that the
peace process has done nothing have been saying the same thing for years, yet never once
offering an alternative.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the charges of corruption are much more serious, but more
disconcerting is President Arafat&#146;s unjustified reaction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat has ordered the imprisonment and the arrest of at least 10 people
who signed a poorly authored document filled with innuendo and politically motivated
partisanship. Any seasoned politician would simply brush the accusations off, use the
power of the office to respond, and then put the signatories on the defensive.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, like so many past mistakes, Arafat has decided it is better to
make his accusers martyrs, and allow them to couple the unjustified political attacks with
the more serious charges of public corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Because every Palestinian, every Arab and every person who hears about or
reads about Arafat&#146;s action will conclude that Arafat must be guilty of the charges
of paving the way &#147;for some opportunists to spread corruption in the Palestinian
community.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I read the translation of the document that was signed by 20 prominent and
well-known anti-Arafat activists. The translation was provided by LAW, the Palestinian
Society for the Protection of Human Rights, a reputable organization that I trust.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is seven paragraphs long. Of that, five and one-half paragraphs were
pure partisan politics typical of the kind of rhetoric that plagues Arafat&#146;s usually
ineffective critics. Only one and one-half paragraphs of the document actually refer to
Arafat, and only indirectly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The pertinent language reads: &#147;Above all, the Palestinian Authority
has followed a systematic methodology of corruption, humiliation and abuse against the
people.&#148; It dives back into the partisan anti-Oslo rhetoric, but resurfaces with this
direct but still, side-handed attack against Arafat: &#147;The President of the PA has
paved the way for some opportunists to spread corruption in the Palestinian
community.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, I also read the response of Arafat&#146;s defenders, who insist the
document accuses Arafat, personally, of corruption. That it does not do. &#147;Paving the
way&#148; to allow others to be corrupt is not direct corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, the Arafat over-reaction aside, the perception of the document is
that Arafat is a corrupt leader, and his actions in ordering the arrest of 10 of the 20
signatories only feeds into the feeling that he must be guilty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The remainder of those who signed the document (about 10) are members of
Arafat&#146;s puppet Palestine National Council and are subject to a protection that
allows them wider freedom to criticize.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, members of the PNC, which long ago abandoned any semblance of
democracy even as it publicly spoke in favour of embracing Democracy, is contemplating
revoking those protections so that Arafat can crack down and imprison them, too.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I don&#146;t always agree with those who attack Oslo. But I have to say
that Arafat&#146;s actions over the past year have undermined the confidence that
supporters of the peace process have given him. He has arrested journalists for writing
things he doesn&#146;t like, and now imprisons other Palestinians who disagree with his
politics and challenge his record of leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These latter actions are the fundamentals of real democracy. You cannot
have democracy if you do not permit free speech, no matter how harsh, no matter how
inaccurate, and no matter how unsubstantiated the charges may be.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the signatories have proof that Arafat and specific individuals are
corrupt, it is easy for them to make that proof public. They all have access to the
Internet and details and names could be made available. With a pro-Israeli media thirsting
to prove the Palestinians to be monsters and terrorists, the charges would get great media
play, as has Arafat&#146;s decision to imprison his critics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat must release the critics and permit them the opportunity to
continue to denounce and criticize all they want.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The real test of power is not the ability to silence your enemies. That is
really a sign of weakness and poor leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A great and strong leader is the one who can continue to do what is best
for the people, while not reacting to the criticism. The leader that can take the
criticism is the leader that is powerful.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat&#146;s recent actions only further demonstrate how weak he, the PA
and the Palestinian people really are.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>1999 could not have ended on a worse note for Israeli diplomats. When
the United Nations General Assembly convened its 54<sup>th</sup> session in December, it
adopted 21 resolutions censuring the Jewish State for maltreating the Palestinian people.
While 155 countries voted for the establishment of a university of Jerusalem&#151;Al
Quds&#151;for Palestinian refugees, only two, Israel and the United States, disapproved.
From 12 resolutions concerning UNRWA came a resounding call by 154 States for Israeli
compensation to the Agency for damaging its property and facilities. Still reeling from
the shock waves of criticism, Israeli policy makers must now pick up the pieces as their
ethnocracy becomes increasingly&#133;</i><b></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Isolated, Exposed and Shamed</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daud Abdullah</i> *</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The extraordinary events at the UN coincided with an equally telling
debate in the Israeli Knesset. There, Arab members have been locked in a fierce battle for
equal rights. Their failure to register significant gains was underscored in a recent
disclosure by Minister of Tourism, Amnon Shahak, that being Israel&#146;s Arab population
must not be allowed to participate in the proposed national referendum on withdrawal from
the Golan Heights. Concurrently, Minister of Justice, Yossi Beilin, exhibited similar
disdain for Palestinian sovereign rights during a tour of the occupied West Bank. Bending
over backwards to appease Jewish settlers, Beilin avowed that the settlements would not be
evacuated as part of a final settlement with the Palestinians. For all their worth, both
statements tell the tragic story of a stillborn democracy sacrificed for the limited gains
of ethnic supremacy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From its inception, the Zionist project was infected by an incurable
abnormality; it could not realize the dream of becoming an inclusive democracy and yet be
an exclusive ethnocracy. Conceived as a State of the Jews and for the Jews, the makers of
Israel never recognized the Palestinian people. Neither the Balfour Declaration nor the
draft resolution submitted to the U.S. Congress (27 January-2 February 1945) made
statutory provisions for them. Although the latter was not formally adopted, it
pre-eminently set the tone for future American commitment toward Israel. It recommended:
&#147;The United States to take appropriate measures to the end that the doors of
Palestine shall be opened for the free entry of Jews into the country, and that there
shall be full opportunity for colonization, so that the Jewish people may ultimately
reconstitute Palestine as a free and democratic Jewish commonwealth.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the end, it was the execution of force rather than the application of
law that brought about the planned colonization of Palestine. Granted, the carefully
structured Israeli citizenship, immigration and land laws, as well as the absence of a
State constitution, were put in place to ensure Jewish dominance over the dispossessed
Palestinians. Like so many other States in the region, mandatory emergency laws also
prevail in Israel. Recent studies confirm there are at least 20 laws that discriminate
against Israel&#146;s Arab population. It was, therefore, the sustained and absolute abuse
of this power that has finally resulted in the humiliation and disgrace which forced
Israel&#146;s Foreign Ministry to record 1999 as a bad year at the United Nations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The frustration and distress felt by the isolation of the Jewish State was
summed up by Gideon Levy in <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i> on 2 January 2000. He wrote, &#147;After
all, there is no other subject on which the world is so united, and there is no other
country, not even Iraq or Libya, that has generated such consistent demands to change its
behaviour for so many years.&#148; As always, there have been few signs of contrition and
much less inclination to change. For even while talking the language of peace, Israeli
negotiators are demanding the reward of a $17 billion &#145;security package&#146; for
withdrawing from illegally occupied Arab lands!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given its stated policy never to accede to blackmail or to reward illegal
acts of terror, reason suggests that the U.S. should reject the current Israeli demand.
Clearly, the U.S. had itself voted for UN Security Council resolution 465 (1980), which
determined and strongly deplored the illegality of Israeli settlements in Palestinian and
other Arab territories. Paradoxically, though, the American position may yet, perhaps, be
understood, if only because it refuses to recognize the jurisdiction of the UN
International Criminal Court set up in 1998 to try war crimes.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For these reasons</b></u><br>
By linking the &#145;peace process&#146; with Israel&#146;s economic security and
political needs, the U.S. has succeeded only in alienating international public opinion.
Middle East watchers maintain that to pervert democracy is one thing, but to openly
espouse colonialist policies is quite another. With regard to the Palestinian people, the
UN has, since 1975, maintained this position, that being it &#147;Strongly condemns all
Governments which do not recognize the right to self-determination and independence of
peoples under colonial and foreign domination and alien subjugation, notably the peoples
of Africa and the Palestinian people&#148; (resolution 3382). That the Palestinians in
Israel and the occupied territories are subjected to a regime of internal colonialism is
now all too evident. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the last 20 years, the average Arab income in Israel remained a
third to a quarter lower than Jewish households; 44% percent of Arab households and 56% of
Arab children were living below the poverty line in 1995. They have, in fact, been
incorporated into the Israeli economy only as low-skilled and menial labourers,
particularly in agriculture, manufacturing and transport. All 63 Arab localities are
ranked in the bottom 40% of Israeli localities. Since the establishment of the State, no
Arab was ever appointed Director-General or even Deputy Director-General of a government
ministry. And, apart from the present handful of Members of Knesset, Arab participation in
public debate is virtually non-existent. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Educational funding further uncovers the depth of discrimination in the
system. When the Shas religious party recently threatened to withdraw from the ruling
coalition, the government immediately approved an injection of �15 million to revamp
their schools. In the case of Arab students, they could hardly obtain scholarships to
attend government schools and universities, let alone to fund their own educational
system. Many are, therefore, forced to cut short their studies. Although they constitute
only 5.9% of the overall university student population, Palestinian Arabs experience
extreme financial difficulties that negatively affect their learning. Given Israel&#146;s
refusal and America&#146;s opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian university in
Jerusalem, it is no wonder that the annual rate of Jewish graduates from institutions of
higher learning is now four times more than Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The systematic denial of resources and key offices to Arabs have led many
analysts, including Israelis, to conclude that the future challenge to the Jewish State
will not come from a Palestinian State but rather from Israel&#146;s Arab population. Oren
Yiftachel of Ben Gurion University observed, &#147;We can also anticipate that the Arab
struggle in Israel will intensify following Arab-Israeli reconciliation in the Middle East
and not subside as many assume.&#148;</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The business class</b></u><br>
With the launching of the Madrid peace process, Israel&#146;s incorporation into the world
market was given a real boost&#151;albeit with cheap labour provided by the Palestinian
work force. Its business class became increasingly more powerful and influential during
the 1990s. After the United States, the Palestinian market in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
provides the largest market for Israeli exports. Given the country&#146;s dogged adherence
to the traditional Zionist objectives of land acquisition and expansion, it is believed
that the business class induced the token concessions granted by the political
establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the issue of land seizure, figures just released by the Legal Centre
for the Defence of the Land confirm that 17,000 dunums were expropriated between September
1998 and September 1999. During the same period, 21,000 fruit-producing trees were
uprooted, while 157 Palestinian homes and a factory were destroyed. Additionally, 154
cases were recorded of Jewish settlers opening live fire on Palestinian residents; one of
the most recent was the shooting upon a school bus carrying children from Al-Aroob refugee
camp in December 1999. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This rabid application of Zionist policy enabled the settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to achieve and sustain a suburban lifestyle over the last two decades.
Hence, they believe it is in their interest that there should be no withdrawals but rather
the escalation in transfer of public funds to the settlements. The role of financial
interest in shaping future policy will manifest itself in coming months. Prominent
supporters of withdrawal, in particular Prof. Yeshayohu Leibowitz, have alluded to this.
Writing in <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i> on 29 December 1999, he declared that Israel needs to
withdraw from Arab lands not because of international law nor the moral significance of
imposing a military rule upon the Palestinians, but rather in order to free money devoted
to the military administration of domestic matters. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">History and justice</b></u><br>
In its quest for ethnic supremacy, Israel may have succeeded in dispossessing and
disempowering the Palestinian people. Yet, in the process, it lost a great measure of
international support and sympathy. The results of the General Assembly&#146;s 54<sup>th</sup>
session have left their diplomats divided over tactics for the coming year. Those who
believe that the entire world is always wrong and Israel is always right favour a policy
of dismissing the United Nations. The other camp which can, somehow, read the writing on
the wall, prefer to mount an immediate diplomatic counter-attack to restore Israel&#146;s
tarnished international image. Whatever they choose, insiders in the world Organization
believe Israel&#146;s record is now beyond repair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If December 1999 was the month of reckoning for the Jewish State, February
2000 may prove to be even more consequential for the Palestinian leadership. For this is
the month they are expected to put their seal of approval to the framework of a final
settlement with Israel. Of course, signing another treaty is very easy. Such an
undertaking would, above all, be a huge favour to outgoing American President Clinton, who
still needs to be distinguished by history for the right reasons. The vast majority of
Palestinians and the Arab nation as a whole face no such pressure. Both history and
justice are on their side. In their view, no agreement would resolve the conflict if it
does not entail a return of the Palestinian refugees to their land and restoration of
ownership thereof. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As they struggle to rid themselves of their own colonial burden, the
Palestinians may well find the Chinese encounter with European colonialism instructive.
Most significantly, that throughout the 442 years of Portuguese rule in Macaw, the Chinese
never surrendered their historical right to the territory. Surely it was the preservation
of this right that enabled today&#146;s generation to regain the territory after previous
generations had failed. In the same manner, the present Palestinian leadership must resist
every offer that seeks to compromise the inalienable rights of future generations.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Interview with Ahmed Shaker Dudin</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dura, West Bank-</b> <strong>By</strong> <b>Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmed Shaker Dudin is one of the co-signers of the &#147;Petition-20&#148;
which castigated Yasser Arafat&#146;s Palestinian self-rule Authority for its rampant
graft and corruption. He, along with Professor Abdul-Sattar Kassem of the Najah National
University, bore the brunt of the PA vendetta following the publication of the leaflet on
28 November, as they were both arrested and placed in solitary confinement for their role
in preparing the Petition. However, Dudin, like Kassem, refused to budge or recant his
signature, or even ask PA Chairman Yasser Arafat to release him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dudin was finally released on the first day of Eid ul-Fitr on 7 January.
The following are excerpts of an interview with him three days after his release.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question:</b> When you signed the Petition, did you expect a harsh
reaction from the Palestinian Authority?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer:</b> Yes, we were sure that the Petition would not be successful
and effective if it did not invite a harsh reaction from the PA, and we did expect the
opportunists and the hangers-on to instigate the regime against us, which they did.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Is it true that you had intended to let thousands of people put
their signature on the Petition?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No, this is not true; we only wanted to instigate the public to
open its eyes to the dire situation that we have reached. The Petition was not leaked to
the public as some people suggested.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>.<b> </b>Did you try to procure other signatories?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No, because we reasoned that if there were too many signers, they
would not have been arrested, and the Petition would have provoked no reaction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> So you wanted to provoke the Authority?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>A.</b> Provoke in the positive sense of the word, namely make it
  reconsider its morbid ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Did you try to involve political groups and factions in the
Petition?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> We completely avoided involving the factions, since these factions
have lost credibility in the wider Palestinian street, and some of them, or most of them,
are flirting with the PA anyway. This is despite the fact that many symbols and figures
associated with the factions were willing to add their signature.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> But some of the signatories, such as Ahmed Qatamesh, are leaders in
their political factions?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Yes, but they signed the document not as faction leaders, but as
Palestinian patriots.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q. </b>How did the Petition find its way to the public?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Some of the co-signatories leaked it to the press, I think.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><b>Q.</b> Did any PA figures visit you while in jail?<b>A.</b> No, not at
all.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Did you personally expect to be arrested?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Yes, for two reasons: First, Fatah (the mainstream PLO faction and
political backbone of the Palestinian Authority) nearly completely abandoned its
historical slogans concerning liberation; and second, many erstwhile figures and leaders
of Fatah have been racing to get &#147;their share of the pie&#148;, as they said, before
it is too late. Fatah simply abandoned its red lines.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q. </b>Don&#146;t you think you expected too much from Fatah?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No, when Fatah readily accepts becoming a &#147;clan&#148; (lesser
than a tribe), this puts its followers to shame. Fatah became a political clan after Oslo,
this is the truth.<b>Q.</b> What made Fatah reach this dire situation?<b>A.</b> Vying for
jobs, money and privileges.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Are you now more disappointed than you were prior to your arrest?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No, actually the fact that they (the PA) lost their nerve by
accusing us of serving foreign masters is proof of their political bankruptcy. They would
have served themselves better had they spoken in a rational and reasonable language. But
they had nothing to offer in light of their political fiasco.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> But the Authority is in the midst of a ferocious political battle
with Israel. Is this the right time to open a new front?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Fighting graft and corruption would strengthen rather than weaken
our negotiating position. Reform is very important so that the people will remain solidly
behind the leadership, otherwise the collective will of the people will be corroded and
frustration will prevail.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Do you believe &#147;despair&#148; has penetrated the collective
soul of the people?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> &#147;Goodness remains in me and my followers till the Final
Day&#148; (a saying of the Prophet Muhammed). The setback is passing, and the Palestinian
people will definitely wake up and repulse all the plots. Nevertheless, it is true that
the people are frustrated by the corruption and defeatism of the leadership as well as by
the disintegration and fragmentation of the Arab world.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>.<b> </b>Will you describe to us the first 48 hours of your arrest?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> I was not arrested in the classical sense of the word. I was
summoned by the Hebron police chief, then I was taken to the Criminal Investigation
Department in Hebron; its chief, I must say, was a good and honest man.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q. </b>Why did they take you there?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Most of the detainees were taken there, I don&#146;t know why.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> After your interview with the Jazira satellite television station,
you were handcuffed and mistreated?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Indeed, I was handcuffed and transferred to the Central Prison in
Nablus and placed in solitary confinement (inside a small room) for nearly 14 days. I was
not harshly treated nor abused verbally. However, we were not allowed to read newspapers
or listen to the radio. But when a representative of the Red Cross visited me, I demanded
newspapers and a radio, and this I soon received afterwards.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q. </b>Were you in high spirits?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> My spirit was high because I was accustomed to political
imprisonment.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Did any Palestinian official seek to persuade you to recant your
signature?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Did Yasser Arafat speak to you directly or indirectly?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No, Arafat is increasingly just a figurehead.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> In your opinion, why didn&#146;t the PA try you before its State
Security Court?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> They probably calculated that this would harm their image.
Moreover, they hadn&#146;t a real case against us.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> But they accused you of planting the seeds of division and of
inciting the public against the Authority?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> Yes, they did, but their accusations did not contain one iota of
truth. On the contrary, we are advocates of genuine national unity; we are against discord
among Palestinians and certainly we are against internal strife. The real division is made
by the continuous spread of graft and corruption and by calling us &#147;mercenaries and
mouthpieces of foreign parties&#148;, attributes which we know well are mendacious.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> They said you could have handed over the Petition to the officials
without galvanizing the public?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> The Legislative Council sought repeatedly to fight corruption by
resorting to no confidence measures against the governments but to no avail. Our system is
such that all powers are concentrated in the hands of one man&#151;the President. Added to
that is the fact that we don&#146;t have a free press, hence writing a memorandum about
corruption to the President would not have done any good.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Do you believe that the anti-corruption forces emerged victorious
from this showdown?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> We called for fighting corruption, and those who were disturbed by
our call themselves admitted there was a lot of corruption, but sought to justify that on
the grounds of inexperience on the part of the Authority. However, this justification is
meaningless, since we still don&#146;t have an independent judicial system more than six
years after the establishment of the PA&#133;this is so because an independent judiciary
would impede the corrupt elements, hence the lack of desire to build a true justice
system.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Is it true that you did what you did because they didn&#146;t give
you a job befitting your long history of struggle and sacrifices?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> No, this is a lie. In fact, a PA operative came to me three months
ago and offered me the job of Director-General whereby I would stay home and take a
monthly salary without doing anything, but I rejected the offer, considering it unethical.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q.</b> Why didn&#146;t the Attorney-General seek to get you out of jail?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A.</b> He is a helpless man himself.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Human rights organization says Israel <br>
and PA violate Palestinians&#146; human rights</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - The Palestinian Society for the Protection of
Human Rights and the Environment, known as LAW, presented at a press conference in
Ramallah on 18 January a summary of its annual report on human rights violations in the
occupied territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report pointed out that human rights in Palestine were still being
violated by both Israel and the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following is a summary of the report: </p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I. Israeli Violations</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;1. <b>Assaults on the right to life</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nineteen Palestinians were killed during 1999. Seven of them were killed
by the Israeli occupying forces, one by the Israeli police, two of them by settlers and
three, who were workers, were killed after being crushed by cars. Two people died in
Israeli prisons, two others were killed as a result of the eruption of landmines and
another two died after being injured during the Intifadah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. <b>Settlement activity</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the year, Israeli occupying forces confiscated 40,178 dunums of
Palestinian land, of which 19,691 dunums were used for settlement expansion and the
establishment of new settlements; 3,830 dunums were declared to be confiscated by the
&#147;Israeli Civil Administration&#148; and 16,657 dunums were confiscated to build new
bypass roads. Building projects to build nine roads have been approved. It is estimated
that these roads will take 10,875 dunums. In addition, it has been declared that six new
bypass roads are to be built. These roads will take 5,782 dunums. At the same time, the
Israeli occupying forces have levelled 7,550 dunums and destroyed the trees in the areas;
15,180 trees, mostly olive, almond and fig trees, have been uprooted or burnt. The trees
are between 10 and 40 years old. In addition, the Israeli occupying forces have removed
2,080 fence posts and fences surrounding agricultural fields. Furthermore, vast spaces of
agricultural land are now considered military zones; 6,087 new settlement units have been
established and the government has declared a tender to build 19,792 new settlement units
after being approved by the government. Plans to construct 9,233 settlement units are
under consideration. In addition, 84 mobile units have received approval to be built.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. <b>Ethnic cleansing policy</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli occupying force continued its policy of ethnic cleansing which
aims at evacuating the land from its indigenous people. During the period which this
report covers, the Israeli occupying forces demolished 93 homes, barracks and water
reservoirs in various Palestinian areas, in particular in area �, which is still
controlled by Israel, including east Jerusalem and its suburbs. This period witnessed
intensive Israeli activity in these areas; 53 houses and barracks, 7 agricultural
nurseries, 8 stores, 10 reservoirs, 10 water wells, and 6 walls were demolished. These
properties were located as follows: 33 in Jerusalem; 17 in Bethlehem; 15 in Nablus; 10 in
Hebron; 7 in Ramallah; 7 in Khan Younis; 3 in Jenin; and 1 in Qalqilyah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to LAW&#146;s documentation, 460 Palestinians received
notifications that their houses or barracks or other facilities would be demolished. Most
of these properties are located in Jerusalem and Hebron. Two of the buildings threatened
to be demolished are used as mosques; one of them is located in Ras al-Amoud in Jerusalem
and the other in the village of al-Walajeh in Bethlehem. Three schools in Ramallah, Jenin
and Hebron are also threatened to be demolished.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">LAW followed the Israeli violations pertaining to home demolition and
adopted 209 cases, of which 24 cases were submitted to the Court of Civil Affairs in
Jerusalem, as the houses were located inside the municipal borders of Arab Jerusalem.
However, at the time of going to print, a decision has not been taken regarding the
demolition of these houses. LAW pleaded 185 cases before the land committees in Beit El;
the appeals were rejected. LAW petitioned the Israeli High Court and obtained
precautionary orders to halt the demolition of 48 houses out of the 185 houses until a
final decision regarding these houses is taken. In addition, LAW succeeded in obtaining
decisions preventing the demolition of 38 houses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. <b>Detainees</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the fact that Israel released 236 Palestinian detainees from its
jails in compliance with the Sharm el-Shiekh agreement, 1,400 Palestinian and Arab
prisoners, of which 15 are held in administrative detention, are still being held in
Israeli jails, a matter violating the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which provides for
the prohibition of transferring the detainees from the occupied land to the land of the
occupying country. Furthermore, the Israeli prison administration continues to hold
prisoners under very bad conditions. This led to the death of two Palestinian detainees
during the year. Moreover, Shabak (the Israeli General Security Services) still subjects
detainees to torture despite the verdict of the Israeli High Court issued on 6 September
1999, which bans torture and considered torture methods used against Palestinian detainees
illegal. During the same year, the Israeli occupying forces arrested many Palestinians.
LAW was able to obtain release decisions for 22 prisoners from Israeli jails. The release
came within the framework of LAW&#146;s programme, which is dedicated to releasing
prisoners who serve two thirds of their sentence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">5. <b>Collective punishment</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli occupying force continued its policy of collective punishment
against Palestinians through the partial or complete closure it imposes on Jerusalem
preventing the Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza from entering the city. These
Israeli practices form a blatant violation of the international treaties such as the
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Lahai agreements of 1907, the International human
rights treaties and the agreements signed by the PLO and Israel. During the year, the
Israeli occupying forces closed all the Palestinian occupied territories, including the
PA-controlled areas. The total closure reached 11 days.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">6. <b>Torture</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails continue to be exposed to torture
by the Israeli General Security Services (GSS) in spite of the 6 September 1999 decision
by the Israeli High Court banning torture and considering the torture methods used against
the Palestinian detainees illegal. However, after the issuance of the decision, LAW
received complaints regarding the exposure of the detainee Ra&#146;ed al-Hummari to
torture in the al-Maskoubeyyeh detention centre. During the year, LAW petitioned the
Israeli High Court twice after its lawyer had been prevented from visiting some clients in
Israeli jails and it is suspected that these detainees are being exposed to torture. The
Court then issued a decision forcing the GSS to allow LAW&#146;s lawyer to visit
Ma&#146;ath and Mahmoud Taqatqah in the al-Maskoubiyyeh detention centre in Jerusalem. The
decision came after LAW&#146;s petition to the Israeli High Court. Then the lawyer visited
the aforementioned detainees on 8 June 1999.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">II. Palestinian Violations</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;1. <b>Assault on the right to life</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thirty-two Palestinians were killed during 1999. The victims, who included
civilians and military personnel, died in various circumstances. These deaths occurred as
a result of shooting incidents, torture during interrogation, vehicle hit and run
incidents, executions, assaults by civilians against security agents or as a result of
weapon misuse. The Palestinian Authority (PA) executed Major Mohammad Abu Mustafa. Two
other civilians, Mohammad Shreiteh from the village of Yatta in Hebron and Mahmoud Bajjali
from the village of Za&#146;tara in Bethlehem, died while being held in police custody.
Seven civilians were killed while law enforcement officials were on duty. Twenty-two died
as a result of weapon&#146;s misuse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. <b>Torture and maltreatment</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the harsh criticism voiced by human rights organizations against
the use of torture by the security services during the interrogation period of suspects in
the past five years, the security services continue to use torture and maltreatment as a
means to extract confessions. LAW received several complaints against the security
apparatus, and in particular against the Police Force where victims have been exposed to
torture and maltreatment. LAW filed a complaint to the Police Commander; however, no
response has been received. During the year 1999, LAW received 244 complaints against the
Palestinian police and other security bodies. It is estimated that 108 complaints have
been brought against the police. The rest of the complaints were as follows: the
Preventive Security Forces, 41; the General Intelligence, 40; the National Security
Forces, 36; Force 17, 9; the Military Intelligence, 9; and the Naval Police, 1.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. <b>Political detention</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the criticism voiced by human rights organizations against the
practice of political detention against dissidents, particularly the Islamic opposition,
and despite the innumerable calls to put an end to the issue of political detention,
including decisions taken by the Legislative Council, marches and demonstrations by the
relatives of political detainees, open hunger strikes by the political detainees, and high
court decisions requesting the release of the political detainees, the PA continued to
hold an estimated 250 political detainees in its prisons. The High Court has ordered the
release of 50. Many have already spent more than two years in custody after the release
order had been issued in their favour, in particular Mahmoud Musleh, whose release was
ordered by the High Court on 30 November 1997 and Ghassan Al-Adassi, whose release was
ordered by the High Court on 6 October 1998. Only nine of the total number of political
detainees, who have already spent five years in prison, have been tried. Trial conditions
do not meet the minimum standards of a fair trial. Among the detainees are 26 university
students and 2 secondary school pupils.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. <b>Violation of the right to freedom of expression, opinion and
peaceful assembly</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In many incidents, the PA has not refrained from violating the right to
freedom of expression, opinion and peaceful assembly. Security services have detained
journalists, academics and politicians. The PA closed private TV and radio stations and
news offices. The closures constitute a direct violation of international human rights
instruments such as Article 19 of the International Covenant for Political and Civil
Rights and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1999, Arua&#146; TV
station was closed by the Preventive Security Apparatus. Moreover, eight journalists have
been detained and interrogated. Human rights activist, Dr. Iyad Saraj was held for a few
hours after an article of his was published in the <i>People&#146;s Rights</i> magazine.
In November 1999, eight public figures were arrested after they had signed a public appeal
statement calling for an end to corruption and a redress of the political situation. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">(And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live...)</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan Heights were captured by
the Israeli forces in the June war of 1967. When Israel gained control of the West Bank,
it was populated by more than 1 million Palestinians. Since the Israeli occupation, the
Israeli government has carried out a systematic effort to decrease the Palestinian
population and simultaneously increase the number of Jews. Even now, while there is talk
of peace between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Jewish settlements are growing and more Arab land is being confiscated. Israel has
continued to promote a colonial settler society which embraces settler supremacy in an age
of de-colonization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the 1967 war, many Palestinians bravely fought to keep the West
Bank and Gaza. Many died; many others were taken prisoner. Some of the Palestinian freedom
fighters were refugees from the 1948 war and had been forced into exile in neighbouring
Arab countries. Some refugees went to Europe, some to the Americas. But it was the war
itself that inspired the urge to liberate once and for all Palestine from its Jewish
usurpers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The intensity and ferocity of the war rang like a battle cry and sent
waves throughout the world. Waves that touched those Palestinian refugees living either in
squalid camps in neighbouring Arab countries, or those who had resettled elsewhere in the
world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once such man was Mustafa&#146;s father. Mustafa was only a toddler when
his father disappeared. His earliest memories are of his father&#146;s warm hugs and his
gracious smile. Whenever his father came home from work, the small Mustafa would run to
greet him, and his father would sweep him up in his arms and hold him tightly as if he
were afraid that one day soon he would no longer enjoy the blessing of hugging his toddler
son or possessing his small but beautiful family.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though Mustafa&#146;s mother was American, she totally identified with her
husband&#146;s culture and his needs. They lived somewhere in the Land of the Free, where,
for the lucky, dreams could still come true and where the eagle flies high above the rocky
mountains. But such dreams of freedom seemed as if they were not meant for Palestinian
refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was a good time for baby Mustafa. It was a beautiful time. He basked in
the love of his mother and father and was the light of their eyes. Everything was euphoric
for the toddler until one day his father did not come home from work as usual. Mustafa
felt this deep sense of loss but could not adequately vocalize his emotions or thoughts.
All he could do was ask his mother, whose eyes were red from crying, &#147;Mommy, where is
daddy? Why didn&#146;t he come home? I miss him. I want him!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Somehow he could sense from his mother&#146;s expression that he would not
see his daddy ever again. Somehow he knew that his daddy had gone very far away. He did
not need her to tell him anything more. That night, his first night without his father, he
finally fell asleep sobbing, knowing deep in his heart that he had lost the most beautiful
thing in his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Time passed. The ache grew. Though the sun still shone down on the
toddler, it was never the same. Though he still played free in the green of his yard at
home, still rode his small red bicycle, still chased honeybees and still picked his
mother&#146;s flowers in her well-kept and fragrant garden, nothing was the same.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Summer turned to winter. Still no father. No daddy to sweep up the small
toddler in his arms and hold him tight. No daddy to teach him how to be a little man. No
daddy to take him out on manly excursions. No daddy to laugh at his small antics. Every
day that passed he felt the loss of his father&#146;s presence even greater.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When baby Mustafa grew a little older, he learned that his father had gone
to fight a war in a distant place called Palestine. His mother told the child that this
was his land, too. But Mustafa could not understand why the war never finished and,
&#147;Mommy, why doesn&#146;t daddy ever come home?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His mother did not know the answer either and after seven years of anxious
waiting, finally married another man. A man who was kind and understanding. A man who was
good. But no man could ever replace Mustafa&#146;s father.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the boy grew older, he tried to keep his father&#146;s smile and
embrace warm and alive in his heart. And when he grew cognizant enough, he knew that he
had to search for his father; he just had to know what happened to him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It has been many, many years now. Mustafa is a grown man. He has several
half-brothers and half-sisters and a generous and giving stepfather who has encouraged the
young man to keep looking for his father. Mustafa journeyed to Palestine and searched
everywhere there for his long lost parent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, one day, he found his father&#146;s brother, Mustafa&#146;s
uncle. But even the uncle did not know where his brother was, or if he was dead or alive.
Now the uncle has died, leaving Mustafa with no connection to his father&#146;s past or a
possible way of knowing where or how to search for him. He has notified the Red Cross and
the Red Crescent, but has heard nothing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He still waits and searches, wearing his father&#146;s love and memories
in his heart and mind as one would wear the most expensive of emeralds. He waits, he hopes
and he searches. But he will never forget those beautiful days when he was a baby and was
cradled in the love of his father&#146;s arms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mustafa&#146;s father went missing in action. He could be dead; he could
be languishing in some Israeli dungeon where the sun never shines. He is but one of the
countless sad fatalities of the Jewish occupation of a land not Jewish. A place that was
once the Land of Milk and Honey and where peace grew as abundant as orange groves. Now,
Mustafa has lost a father and a country he could really call his own.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There will never be peace in Palestine and the rest of the Middle East
until Israeli settlements are halted and until the Israeli people genuinely want to live
in peace with themselves and those around them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How Do We Understand Globalization?</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Globalization is an attempt to create a new view of the world by looking
at it as a unified whole. It also involves making the world as a whole a subject of study,
as well as establishing tools and technology capable of dealing with the world&#146;s
elements and dynamics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Globalization has ushered in a wave of changes that encompass the entire
  world, thereby bringing its parts into inter-related proximity. The objective of
  globalization is to develop a paradigmatic mindset that views the world as extremely
  compact, densely formed, and easily interactive. This theoretical picture differs from the
  world in its practical reality, which is governed by geography (in its size and its varied
  and complex surface features) and by the laws of physics (in terms of time and place).</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Globalization has articulated a constructionist, reductionist, and
  integrationist philosophy that purports to be highly sensitive, complex, and coherent. It
  tries to force into a monistic or unitary mold a world that is varied and multifaceted and
  contradictory in its identities, cultures, nationalities, languages, religions, and
  geography. Globalization is a silent construct of ideology and creed, designed to support
  the revolution in information and communication technology and advanced media techniques
  that have connected the earth in a network of relationships resembling that of a small
  village. Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian sociologist and professor of media studies at
  Toronto University, coined the term &#147;global village&#148; in the late 1960s in his
  book, <i>War and Peace in the Global Village.</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Globalization arrived to provide content and intellectual direction to the
  concept of the global village, as well as to become an improved version of it in
  philosophy and desired goals.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This understanding of globalization has encouraged comprehensive worldwide
  attention to this phenomenon, in which culture, economy, polity, and society are
  intertwined, along with education, defense, security, and environment. The world has
  become concerned with this issue, approaching it through various types of understanding,
  criticism, insight, and analysis, until globalization has now become one of the most
  commonly used words. This can be a dangerous phenomenon. It has produced sharp
  disagreements in ways of seeing and understanding by discounting everything that does not
  fit into globalization and emphasizing the necessity of engaging the world and being
  uncritically open to it and interacting with its issues and affairs. It is no longer
  possible for countries and societies to isolate themselves from the world and its strong
  waves of change. There is no one capable of living alone in this world. Isolation is
  neither a solution nor an option, and, in fact, is impossible in a world that is so
  interconnected. But this does not mean that countries and societies should adopt an open
  door policy and be swept into globalization and its storms of change.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">No single reading of globalization is possible. We are in a world where
  ideas proliferate and theories compete, so the world will never be limited to one concept
  of globalization.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">During the last century, the West has been able to manage change according
  to its own intellectual design and its own economic and moral imperatives. It has also
  been able to push change forcefully, the result of which has been the civilizational
  dominance of the West. The West is the largest actor in the world at the present time, and
  it controls the most important elements of change, such as the visual and oral media
  institutions, communication and information systems, economic organizations, and
  multinational and transglobal corporations. These institutions produced globalization, and
  they can be its most dangerous results.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The West, which has produced the concept of globalization, has determined
  its content, identity, and economic and intellectual building blocks. The West also leads
  the concept and movement worldwide. This dominance is one of the most important sources of
  fear and trepidation among many nations and civilizations affected by globalization. The
  West is self-centered in wanting to see itself and its civilization as synonymous with
  this world. The history of West/non-West relations has often been tragic, especially when
  the West was savagely colonial and sought to expand and control its imperialistic culture
  beyond its own borders. If the world were led by a civilization other the Western, other
  civilizations would be in a much better state and would have progressed much further. The
  world&#146;s civilizational map would be fundamentally different from what it is today.
  The West wanted to be the exclusive possessor of civilization, and therefore resisted the
  rise of other civilizations by embarking on the largest process of civilizational
  destruction in human history. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Until today the West has not changed its behavior patterns toward other
  nations and civilizations. Most of the recent papers and theses disseminated and promoted
  in the world reveal these patterns clearly, beginning with the article by Francis Fukuyama
  on &#147;The End of History and the Last Man.&#148; Fukuyama negated and delegitimized all
  the nations and civilizations of the world. He did not see anything besides Western
  civilization, which he considered the end of history. There is also the article by Samuel
  Huntington on &#147;The Clash of Civilizations,&#148; which encourages the West to
  confront other civilizations, especially the ones that have dynamism and the power of
  renewal, such as Islamic civilization and Chinese/Confucian civilization. These
  necessarily create cultural and civilizational tension and divisions. A third seminal
  article is &#147;Searching for a New Enemy&#148; which exposes the West and reveals its
  weaknesses. Is the West, after all this progress, in need of an enemy? When will it
  eventually not need this enemy?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The fear and uneasiness that various nations and civilizations display
  toward globalization as the latest Western product is justified.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">We in the Arab and Islamic world are not the only ones who exhibit this
  fear. From inside the West itself there are many who are extremely wary of globalization
  and resist it. At the forefront of these people are the French. Europe in general has
  started to fight for its identity and its social and moral standing in the face of what it
  calls the &#147;cultural encroachment of Americanization.&#148; This will increase the
  cultural differentiation between the United States and Europe.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In recent years, the French have been actively promoting Francophonism and
  cultural pluralism in response to the rapidly encroaching Anglo-Saxonism. In May, 1998, a
  conference entitled &#147;Francophonism and Globalization&#148; was held in Beirut,
  Lebanon, under the auspices of the 12<sup>th</sup> General Assembly of the Association of
  Universities Speaking Partially or Fully in French (OBLOF); and the University of French
  Connection Networks (OREF). The conference indicated its unease with the trend of
  globalization and criticized it. Prior to this, in April, 1996, the French Socialist Party
  issued a report entitled: &#147;Globalization, Europe, and France,&#148; which strongly
  attacked globalization in its American form. This report revealed the possibility of
  increased cultural differentiation between Europe and the United States.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">It is striking how much forceful criticism globalization has received
  throughout the world, which points to the existence of realistic fears. Nations and
  civilizations are not ready to be civilizationally integrated and lost in the rosy dreams
  and magical promises of globalization. Behind these are hidden dangers, such as those
  portrayed by Thomas and Wilken in &#147;Globalization and the South.&#148;1 They believe
  that globalization will reinforce differences and cause social injustice and inequality
  between the North, which is wallowing in riches, and the South, which is in extreme
  poverty. Globalization increases North/South differences and makes it difficult, if not
  impossible, to fill the gap between them. The gap between rich and poor has been
  increasing and will increase further with globalization, not only in the countries of the
  South, but also inside the North itself.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Kaufman and Yengiz have written in &#147;Globalization: Theory and
  Practice&#148;2 that globalization has established a tradition of great violence toward
  the environment, with effects such as pollution, the hole in the ozone layer, the
  reduction of biodiversity, and the overconsumption of irreplaceable fossil fuels.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The French writer Vivian Forster, in her highly critical and controversial
  book &#147;Economic Terror,&#148; has asked: What will happen when we learn that crises,
  as well as various changes, lead a whole society toward the unknown, until that whole
  civilization is gone forever?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">These angry critiques have been opposed by the French writer Alan Mink, in
  his book, &#147;Happy Globalization,&#148; which tries to present globalization as neither
  good nor evil in and of itself. There is no need to create an atmosphere of fear
  surrounding globalization by exaggerating its barbarity and horrors.</p>

and myth, and facts and assumptions; and involving both supporters and detractors of
globalization.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">An Appeal for Mariam</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ruth Anderson</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>(Dedicated to British MP George Galloway)</em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Mariam Hamza. I am a six-year-old Iraqi child afflicted with
cancer. Two years ago, a great man, who did not speak my language, came to me and took me
to London for treatment. I never knew there was a place called London. I had never been in
a plane before. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At first I did not understand this pleasant-looking man who spoke in a
strange tongue. But I did understand the kind and generous smile on his face and could
feel the love that emanated from his heart. In London, I underwent a long series of cancer
treatments and returned to Iraq. All the people who had been so nice to me, including the
man whose name is British MP George Galloway, thought I was in remission. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But living conditions are very severe in Iraq. It did not take long for my
cancer problems to resurface again. Harsh sanctions have been imposed on Iraq since 1990.
The overall death toll owing to the sanctions has reached 1.2 million. And now a Spanish
delegation investigating the state of healthcare in Iraq has been told by Baghdad doctors
that there has been a sharp rise in leukaemia cases caused by depleted uranium shells used
by the U.S.-led Allies in the 1991 Gulf war. Furthermore, owing to the sanctions and the
conflict, many of the Iraqi water sources are polluted and malnutrition is rampant. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A UNICEF report published last August found that child mortality rates had
more than doubled in central and southern Iraq since the sanctions were first imposed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The nice British MP that gave me hope and helped me recover&#151;at least
temporarily&#151;has begun a campaign to raise money and draw international attention to
the health situation in Iraq. He named the campaign after me and it is called the Mariam
Appeal. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I have now returned to Baghdad with my grandmother after a 10-week stay in
a private hospital in Amman specializing in cancer treatment as a result of my relapse. I
cannot begin to express how well I was treated there, too, and how kind the Jordanian
people have been to me. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though my condition is stabilized, no one is sure how much longer I can
stay alive. But then, all life is in God&#146;s hands. As a result of my cancer, I am now
blind and will never see the beauty of a sunrise again, nor see the smile on my sweet
grandmother&#146;s face, nor see the blue of a summer sky, nor the rain as it falls on the
thirsty desert. But what is worse than losing my sight is the fact that I will continue to
suffer from a defective nervous system. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So many children in war-torn countries are victims of terrible fates. They
suffer from malnutrition, polluted water supplies, lack of basic essentials&#151;including
food and medicine&#151;and live in constant fear. Most of all, they are denied the right
to live as all children deserve to live, free from war and free from oppression. They
should be free to run, sing and play without any fear from harm. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I know that children in Palestine, Lebanon and now in Chechnya suffer,
too. I feel so sad for them as well. I wish that I could help them, but I am not even able
to help myself. If all Muslim countries were united, then such tragedies as my own would
never happen. But alas, the majority of Muslim leaders care only for themselves and are
not at all concerned about the welfare of people in their own countries, much less with
people outside their borders. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am a candle in the wind. I am not able to withstand the storms that rage
around me. But my last dying wish is that there would be peace everywhere and that
children like me would not have to die because of the hate and anger of warmongers and
that, for once, all Muslim nations would be united. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I blow a kiss to you. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky</i></p>

<p ALIGN="center">Part 5</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Jewish Fundamentalism Within Jewish Society</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haredi objection to Zionism is based upon the contradiction between
classical Judaism, of which the Haredim are the continuators, and Zionism. Numerous
Zionist historians <i>have </i>unfortunately obfuscated the issues here. Some detailed
explanation is therefore necessary. In a famous talmudic passage in <i>Tractate Ketubot, </i>page
111, which is echoed in other parts of the Talmud, God is said to have imposed three oaths
on die Jews. Two<i> </i>of these oaths that clearly contradict Zionist tenets are: I) Jews
should not rebel against non-Jews, and 2) as a group should not massively emigrate to
Palestine before the coming of the Messiah. (The third oath, not discussed here, enjoins
the Jews not to pray too strongly for the coming of the Messiah, so as not to bring him
before his appointed time.) During the course of post-talmudic Jewish history, rabbis
extensively discussed the three oaths. Of major concern in this discussion was the
question of whether or not specific Jewish emigration to Palestine was part of the
forbidden massive emigration. During the past 1,500 years, the great majority of
traditional Judaism&#146;s most important rabbis interpreted the three oaths and the
continued existence of the Jews in exile as religious obligations intended to expiate the
Jewish sins that caused God to exile them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In recent years, a number of Israeli Jewish scholars, who in general have
developed a more honest Jewish historiography, have focused upon the essence of rabbinical
interpretations of the three oaths. In his highly regarded scholarly book, <i>Messianism,
Zionism and Jewish Religious Radicalism </i>(published in Hebrew in Israel in 1993),
Aviezer Ravitzky, for example, provided a good summary of rabbinical interpretations of
the three oaths from<i> </i>the fifth century AD (or CE - Common Era). In his analysis,
Ravitzky noted that in the ninth century, Rabbi Shmuel, son of Hosha&#146;ana, an
important leader of Palestinian Jewry, in a poetic prayer quoted the following as
God&#146;s words. &#147;I took the oath of my people not to rebel against Christians and
Muslims, told them to be silent until I myself will overturn them as I did in Sodom.&#148;
In the thirteenth century during the time that some rabbis and poets emigrated to
Palestine for religious reasons,<sup> </sup>Ravitzky continued, other rabbis in many pans
of the world quoted the three oaths theory to warn against the spread of this potentially
dangerous phenomenon. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Moshe, the spiritual leader of a Jewish
congregation in Wurtzburg, Germany, in the thirteenth century warned Jews who wrongly
emigrated to Palestine that God would punish them with death. At about the same time,
Rabbi Ezra of Gerona, Spain, a famous cabbalist<sub>, </sub>wrote that a Jew emigrating to
Palestine forsakes God who is only present in the diaspora, where a majority of Jews live,
and not in Palestine. In his book, Ravitzky stressed that similar and even more extreme
views continued to be expressed until the nineteenth century. The celebrated German rabbi,
Yehonathan Eibshutz, wrote in the mid-eighteenth century that massive immigration of Jews
to Palestine, even with the consent of all the nations of the world, was prohibited before
the coming of the Messiah. In the early nineteenth century, Moses Mendelsohn and other
supporters of the Jewish Enlightenment, as well as their opponents such as Rabbi Rafael
Hirsch, the father of modern orthodoxy in Germany, agreed and continued to derive this
prohibition from the three oaths. Hirsch wrote in 1837 that God had commanded Jews
&#147;never to establish a state of their own by their own efforts.&#148; Rabbis in
Central Europe were even more extreme. In 1837, the same year that Hirsch prohibited Jews
from declaring a Jewish state, an earthquake in northern Palestine killed a majority of
the inhabitants of Safad, of which many were Jews, some of whom had recently immigrated.
Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum, a leading Hungarian rabbi, attributed the earthquake to God&#146;s
displeasure with excessive Jewish emigration to Palestine. Teitelbaum stated: &#147;It is
not God&#146;s will that we should go to the land of Israel by our own efforts and
will.&#148; Rabbi Moshe Nachmanides, who died in 1270, was the one exceptional Jewish
leader who opined that Jews should not only emigrate to but should also conquer the land
of Israel. Other important rabbis of that time and for many centuries thereafter ignored
or strongly disagreed with the view of Nachmanides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the 1970s, seven centuries after his death, Nachmanides became the
patron saint of the NRP and the Gush Emunim settlers. NRP rabbis also have claimed that
the three oaths do not apply in messianic times and that, although the Messiah has not yet
appeared, a cosmic process called the beginning of redemption has begun. During this
period some of the previous religious laws should allegedly be disregarded; others should
be changed. Thus, the dispute between the NRP and the Haredim has centered upon the issue
of whether Jews are living in normal times or in the period of the beginning of
redemption. Having made some political gains and becoming more self-confident after the
1988 national election, the Haredim strengthened their principled opposition to Zionism
and to the NRP. In 1989, the two most important Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Shach and Rabbi
Yoseph, held an anti-Zionist convention in Bnei Brak, Israel. Their speeches, devoted to
expressions of principled opposition to Zionism and the beginning of redemption doctrine,
were published in the Haredi newspaper, <i>Yated Ne &#145;eman, </i>on September 18, 1989.
The two rabbis from an halachic perspective also addressed the vital Israeli political
issue of whether some areas of the land of Israel should be given to non-Jews<sub>, </sub>that
is, to Palestinians. They refuted the NRP and Gush Emunim view that in accordance with the
beginning of redemption no land of Israel should be given to non-Jews. Rabbi Yoseph and
Shach argued that Jews still live in normal times when visible help of God cannot always
be expected to save Jewish lives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabbi Yoseph, renowned for his halachic erudition, presented in-depth
analysis and correctly noted that Rabbi Shach here agreed fully with him. Rabbi Yoseph
began by disagreeing with the NRP and Gush Emunim rabbis who argued that the beginning of
redemption and God&#146;s commandment to conquer the land of Israel were more important
than the saving of Jewish lives that would be lost in the war of conquest. Rabbi Yoseph
acknowledged that in messianic times, Jews would be more powerful than non-Jews and would
then be obligated to conquer the land of Israel, to expel all non-Jews and to destroy the
idolatrous Christian churches. Rabbi Yoseph, however, asserted that the messianic time of
redemption had not yet arrived. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jews are not in fact more powerful than the non-Jews and are unable to
  expel the non-Jews from the land of Israel because the Jews fear the non-Jews ...
  God&#146;s commandment is then not valid .. Even non-Jews who are idolaters live among us
  with no possibility of their being expelled or even moved. The Israeli government is
  obligated by international law to guard the Christian churches in the land of Israel, even
  though those churches are definitely places of idolatry and cult practice. This is so in
  spite of the fact that we are commanded by our [religious] law to destroy all idolatry and
  its servants until we uproot it from all parts of our land and any areas that we are able
  to conquer &#133; Surely, this fact continues to weaken the religious meaning of the
  Israeli army&#146;s conquests [in 1967].</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The quotation cited above illustrates well a part of Israel&#146;s <i>realpolitik.
</i>Before the 1996 election, both Peres and Netanyahu regarded Rabbi Yoseph as an
important political figure and often courted him openly. This was done in spite of
Yoseph&#146;s publicly declared doctrine that Jews, when sufficiently powerful, have a
religious obligation to expel all non-Jews from the country and destroy all Christian
churches. Leftists and most peace advocates in Israel lauded Yoseph and Shach for agreeing
to withdrawal from the occupied territories but neglected to mention and actually
suppressed the major thrust of the Yoseph and Shach position. For the most part the
Western media avoided reporting the most essential points of the Yoseph speech. The
reality here is that the Yoseph-Shach view constitutes one part of the hawkish bean of
Israeli politics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his speech, Rabbi Yoseph also acknowledged the halachic prohibition of
selling real estate to non-Jews in the land of Israel, but he limited this prohibition to
a time when doing so would not cause the loss of Jewish life. In the same manner he dealt
with the issue of whether Jews should trust only in the hope of God&#146;s help or should
take their own precautions against danger or war. Yoseph contended that this issue is
analogous to the question of whether a Jew who is ill on Yom Kippur should be given food
to save his or her life. In the latter case, according to Rabbi Yoseph, the Jew who is ill
should be given food even if the medical experts disagree with one another about the
danger to life that would exist if the fast were observed. Following this line of
reasoning, Rabbi Yoseph opined that, even if the military experts disagreed with one
another as to whether withdrawal from the territories would avert war, the government
should order withdrawal. Rabbi Yoseph, not influenced by the trusting-in-God argument,
pointed out that Jews had been killed in previous wars and that the miraculous coming of
the Messiah establishing God&#146;s rule over the world would occur without the loss of a
single Jewish life. Rabbi Yoseph also noted that the state of Israelis filled with Jewish
sinners who provoke God. He quoted numerous rabbinical authorities who agreed with him
that the three oaths were still valid.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabbi Yoseph&#146;s view did not interest Rabin, Peres or Netanyahu. His
dazzling display of erudition, occupying three large pages of small print, moreover, did
not convince a single NRP rabbi. Rabbis Yoseph and Shach, who a bit later became enemies,
continued to oppose Zionism and the beginning of redemption doctrine; they continued to
advocate their variety of Jewish fundamentalism and to command the allegiance in 1996 of
fourteen members of the 120-member Knesset. Rabbi Shach, who is more extreme in his
opposition to Zionism than is Rabbi Yoseph, prohibited the Knesset members of his
political party, Yahadut Ha&#146;Torah, from becoming ministers in Netanyahu&#146;s
Zionist government. Shach, however, ordered his party&#146;s Knesset members to support
the Netanyahu government. Netanyahu rewarded Yahadut Ha&#146;Torah by creatively giving it
control of the ministry of housing. Netanyahu made himself the housing minister and signed
almost blindly anything submitted by Deputy Minister Ravitz of the Yahadut Ha&#146;Torah
Party. This procedure was obviously employed to obviate the necessity of Yahadut
Ha&#146;Torah&#146;s formally joining a Zionist government while nevertheless enjoying its
benefits. Contrary to Rabbi Shach, Rabbi Yoseph ordered members of his party to become
ministers in the Netanyahu government. These facts illustrated the political importance of
Rabbis Yoseph&#146;s and Shach&#146;s views.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabbi Yoseph&#146;s clearly expressed views on the territories not only
reflect the Haredi view but also clearly resemble a great part of the actual foreign
policy of the state of Israel. Rabbi Yoseph has argued that Jews have a religious duty to
expel all Christians from the state of Israel only if doing so would not endanger Jewish
life. Rabbi Yoseph has postulated that any Jewish concessions to non-Jews in the state of
Israel has to be based solely upon the consideration of whether denial thereof could prove
harmful for Jews. Rabbi Yoseph would almost certainly have favored a permanent occupation
of all the territories if he were convinced that this would not provoke Arabs to harm
Jews. Israeli governmental leaders with almost full support of Israeli Jews believed after
the June 1967 war that the Arabs were incapable of harming Israel and therefore refused to
make any concessions. Only after suffering grievous losses in the October 1973 war, and
fearing another war, did the government of the state of Israel, again with almost the full
support of Israeli Jews, agreed to return the Sinai to Egypt. In 1983, even after the
massacres at Sabra and Shatila, the Israeli leaders contemplated permanent occupation of
one-third of Lebanon and domination of the remaining two-thirds. Sharon concluded a peace
treaty, based upon those terms, with the then puppet Lebanese government. The guerilla
warfare, conducted by the Lebanese in 1984 and 1985, which resulted in consistent Israeli
casualties, caused the Israeli leaders to abandon those plans and to retreat. Israeli
foreign policy, although usually conceived and conducted by secular Jews, has to date
displayed an essence derived in part from the Jewish religious past. Indeed, the Zionist
movement, which underwent a partial secularization, also kept many basic Jewish religious
principles. Rabbi Yoseph, Ben Gurion, Sharon and all major Israeli politicians share a
common ground in policy advocacy.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Flora Nicoletta*</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jabaliya Camp</b> - Here in Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip is
where the spark originated that lit the flame of the Intifada on 8 December 1987; it is
from this camp that the uprising against the 20-year-old Israeli military occupation began
and spread quickly through the entire Strip and the West Bank and lasted until 1993. Here,
they tell the story of a dog.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Ismail, an old refugee: &#147;He was small, not big. He used to stay
at the front door of a family&#146;s home in the camp. He was sleeping on the doorstep. He
was a very strong dog. He was running towards the people casting stones to warn them that
the Israelis were coming to that place; the stone-throwers fled and the dog barked. He
took the gas canisters and threw them in the open sewers running in the middle of the
alleys. And when the demonstrators were going <i>en masse</i> to hurl stones at the
Israeli police station, he would go with them. He was running with them. When the Israelis
opened fire, he escaped with the others.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After a while, the Israelis knew about the dog and eventually killed
him. In the proximity of the police station, near a pole, the inhabitants buried the
animal. Nowadays, the burial place doesn&#146;t exist anymore. With the arrival of the
Palestinian police, who took possession of the premises in 1994, the crowds in greeting
them damaged the grave unintentionally. Many people wrote about the dog. There was a big
funeral. I saw it with my own eyes when they erected the grave. I knew his owner;
he&#146;s dead now; his name was Dawass. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It&#146;s the plain truth what I&#146;m telling you; you can ask;
everybody knew the dog. He was spotted white and black; he was small. I was afraid and he
was not. He used to behave like this: when the people flung stones at the soldiers, he
would run everywhere. In case there was live fire, he was able to understand whether it
was coming from the Israeli side or not. When they threw tear gas, well the dog used to
dig the soil for burying the canisters and then left. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Many were affected when they killed him&#151;furious...it was in
1991, if I remember well. All in the camp knew the dog. If you ask, they will tell you
what I&#146;m saying now&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Emad is a young man from Jabaliya camp. He works for a human rights
organization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The dog was helping his friends who hurled stones&#151;the <i>shabab</i>.
He carried the stones in his mouth, put them near the youths, and they were ready to be
used. In the middle of the battle, the <i>shabab</i> had no time to look for the stones;
it was the dog who brought them. He had gotten used to seeing the youths collecting and
hurling the stones; it was a constant action. Well, he, too, learned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Once I saw the dog; it was mid-Intifadah. Our camp is extremely
large, but he was famous. On one occasion, I heard the people saying the soldiers had shot
tear gas and the dog took back the canisters to the soldiers. Even if the army arrived
unexpectedly during the night, he started to bark. He was a small dog. I don&#146;t
remember when he died. He was brown and black or dark brown. After he passed away, there
was a funeral procession. In my camp, there are 80,000 refugees; it&#146;s the largest
camp in Palestine. Even the dog refused the military occupation&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Maher, another camp resident, works as a nurse in the intensive care unit
of Esh-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;He was black and white...white with black spots. At night, he would
reconnoitre the streets. If he saw the enemy troops, he would bark and return back and
would stay close to the youths while continuing to bark. On the contrary, when the way was
clear, he would come back without barking. He was working with the masked youths. I saw
him several times&#151;I think five or six times. I saw him near an Israeli military camp.
When they shot tear gas, he collected the canisters and threw them in the open sewers. I
myself saw him doing this. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;On one occasion, the Israeli army put him in jail for one day, and
he refused to eat for the entire day; then they let him go. Later, they shot him in his
paw...his paw was broken. The masked youths took him to a veterinarian to treat him; they
gave him good food, and once he got well, he again returned to work with the <i>shabab</i>.
The Israeli army fired at him another time and he died. During the clashes, I saw him; he
was carrying stones in his mouth and brought them to the <i>shabab</i>.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One day I went to the Dawass family in the camp. As soon as he knew the
reason for my visit, a young man who was there, Sufyan Ashrafi, 28, started immediately to
speak.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Many of my friends were martyred, but I cried more for the dog than
for my friends. Not because the dog was dearer to me than them, but because it was natural
for my friends to fight for their land; it was their duty. But what was the fault of the
dog to be tortured and killed by the military?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Several events happened. I want to tell you one of them. The dog
used to take the gas canisters and tried to throw them in the open sewers. I&#146;m not
lying, I&#146;m not lying, it&#146;s a real story. However, it will be better if I tell
you the story from the beginning... </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;As a people living under occupation, we were the creators of the
Intifadah, and we were not spectators but rather very active, and I want to tell you how
we taught the dog. I have to mention that here in Palestine, and not only in Palestine,
but in the third world in general, when the children see an animal, they cast stones at
him. At that dog, nobody has ever cast a stone. That dog was with the people; no one
wanted to hurt him. I&#146;m not exaggerating, I&#146;m not exaggerating.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;One wonders how the dog went with the people, how did he start to
learn? Where the demonstrators went, the dog followed them. If they fled, he, too, fled.
The people used to throw the gas canisters in the sewers, and the dog imitated them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After a while, the dog started to have a good reputation in the
camp, but the Israeli army also started to know about him. Once the dog escaped from the
troops and took shelter in the house in front of ours, trying to hide himself under the
bed. The military entered and fired at him; they fired 16 rubber-coated metal bullets with
an M-16. The animal was really feeling bad and underwent treatment for approximately two
weeks. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;At a certain point, he became very famous. Many people gave him
food; they brought him food even from the other parts of the camp. The butcher of the
market gave him meat, but if the meat did not come from the market, he never touched it.
On one occasion, while he was well-known, the soldiers tried to kill him. They took aim
and opened fire; the bullet entered his shoulder. He was rushed to a veterinarian who gave
him an injection. That night he was really in critical condition. The bullet was removed
and fortunately he stayed alive. It was a veterinarian living in Esh-Shifa camp who
operated on him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Things were happening this way: one day there were heavy clashes,
the day after it was rest and the troops jumped at the opportunity to come unexpectedly to
capture people. The dog, in this area, was smelling or catching sight of a soldier and
started to bark in order to let the residents know. But because they teased him, he
started slowly, slowly to be frightened by the Israelis. At times, he only barked, just to
give the alert, and then would go to the garage to escape the ill-treatment of the
military.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khaled: &#147;Six years before the Intifadah, we brought him from
Beersheva [in the Negev desert in Israel]. He was small. We took him from the Bedouin,
that is to say the Arabs, not from the Jews. His name was Jimmy. He was working with all
the factions. All the factions fought together. He was white spotted with black. Thanks to
him, many of their plans fell through. The army and the secret services were trying to get
rid of him. Once they sent a woman, a woman not from here, probably a collaborator, to
take him. She came pretending that the animal had bitten her son and consequently, the
doctors from the hospital wanted to examine her son. The dog never did anyone any harm. It
was only a trick to take away the animal. &#145;We know our dog since a long time, he has
never hurt anybody. To those who send you to take the dog, tell them we don&#146;t want to
give him away&#146;, we answered the woman.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sufyan: &#147;How could the dog differentiate between the Israeli soldiers
and the Palestinians carrying weapons? He was able to know the difference. Even if armed
Palestinians were passing by him, he didn&#146;t bark. On the contrary, without even
seeing them, he was able to understand there were enemy soldiers in the area and barked.
In the end, they came and threatened the owner that he would be arrested because of the
dog. If you want to write about him, your copybook will not be enough. He became famous
and was considered a hero in Jabaliya camp. Even the children, who usually ill-treat the
animals, became his friends. And us, as Palestinian people, if there is any possibility,
we will make a film about him because he deserves it.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khaled: &#147;Through the years of the Intifada, they imposed a curfew on
the entire Gaza Strip at 8 in the evening. Once&#151;it was around midnight&#151;the
neighbours heard, including this other friend who is present with us now, the dog
expressing himself in a strange way: he was barking weakly, feebly, sadly. It was clear he
was in danger in that moment. Whoever heard the animal could understand he was under
torture, but because of the curfew, nobody could get out. In the morning, they found the
dog dead, at block No. 6. Without bullets they killed him&#151;by beating and then they
strangled him with a rope. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;After learning of the dog&#146;s death, the inhabitants escalated
their combat against the occupation, just as when people were martyred, or maybe more. It
was announced a day of mourning in the camp. Many were crying. The children collected
money, bought a sack of cement, built a grave similar to the Muslim graves and wrote his
name on it. They also wrote his name over all the walls, as we used to do for the martyrs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;So far, we are still speaking about him, and the next generation
will speak about him, and we want all the future generations aware of the dog&#146;s
story. Even our animals&#151;Palestinian animals&#151;are tortured like us; they cannot
escape the evil actions of the enemy. They implement apartheid even against the animals.
With a rope they strangled him...Maybe God sent us this creature to save many people.
After his death, that very day, the Israelis caught 30 people during a raid because the
dog was not there, but if the dog was present, they would never succeed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Look, if someone would come to tell us a similar story, we would
never believe him, but we were involved in this story and we have seen the animal. While
I&#146;m speaking with you about the dog, at this very moment, inside myself, I feel very
sad, extremely sad. He took part in the Intifadah and was very active. The love for this
creature is still alive in our hearts. He passed away at the end of 1992, in the
winter...maybe in November...when it was raining. The same day martyrs fell in the camp. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Later on, people tried to get dogs similar to him, but they
didn&#146;t succeed. A dog needs loving care; here, not even the human beings are
surrounded with care; in addition, a place is necessary to keep the dog and here, in our
houses, there is not enough space even for us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Now I want to show you where the dog was buried, a few metres from
home, near the pole. The Israelis demolished the tomb several times, and then it was not
rebuilt again. Here it&#146;s called block No. 6; we&#146;re near the market, near the
police station; it&#146;s the centre of the camp, not far from the great mosque and the
schools. My name is Khaled Dawass, and I&#146;m 30.&#148; </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">E. Yaghi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Movladi, and I am a Chechen freedom fighter. Those who write
history call me a rebel. But the label is untrue, for as all freedom fighters, I fight for
the liberation of my country from the oppression of an invading atheist enemy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Chechen people have been fighting against Russian oppression for
decades. Several times in recent history, the Russians have made serious attempts to
exterminate my people. Under the guise of an alleged bomb attack last year, the Russians
used this as an excuse to launch an all-out war against the Chechen people. The siege of
Chechnya has now entered its fourth month. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the time of this writing, the Russians now control one third of the
Chechen capital of Grozny. During daylight hours, they gain control of more Chechen-held
outposts, while at night, brave freedom fighters retake much of what was earlier
confiscated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We have suffered heavy losses. The odds against us are so great that
anyone can tell that we do not have a chance. But, we are fighting for freedom, the very
survival of our country, and we are not afraid of dying, for we know that we fight Jihad
in the name of God. To die is the greatest blessing any martyr can have. This is why we
have had any chance at all of fighting against a very heavily- and well-equipped Russian
enemy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My comrades and myself have been surrounded by Russian atheists who fear
no God, fear no evil and who continue to pillage and plunder Chechen villages. Our
supplies have been cut off, and we wage a war against the <i>kafr</i> (unbelieving)
invaders in sub-zero temperatures. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is even harder to bear than the arctic cold is the fate of the
elderly and women and children. The other day, we visited a hospital. My stomach felt so
queasy when I saw the wounded civilians, especially the children. One of the young nurses
was crying and she could not stop. I will never forget the faces of the small children who
have been wounded by tons and tons of relentless Russian mortars, shells and bombs. This
is not merely a war waged by the inadequate old drunk Yeltsin against rebel Chechen
soldiers, but an attempt at genocide...an all-out war against the civilian population of
my people. Russian tanks now blast away buildings in Grozny while helicopter gunships
hover overhead, firing down on our positions. Warplanes and helicopters have flown more
than 200 raids, the worst yet, in the savage Russian bombardment of our city. One of the
Russian generals is missing. We have captured him and his name is Major General Mikhail
Malofeyev. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the streets of my beloved Grozny, there is furious hand-to-hand combat
and the Russian forces are moving in on us freedom fighters from several directions in an
apparent attempt to sandwich us between their forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fierce fighting also continues in the southern Chechen mountains where
Russian aircraft and artillery have been pounding our positions. As can be expected, many
of our civilian population have been killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As I write this report, my hands are freezing and I suffer from frostbite.
When I sleep intermittently off and on, I dream of my parents and my wife and children. I
have not received word from any of them for days and do not even know if they live or not,
or are among the injured. Ah, but if only you could see Chechnya when there is no war and
when the summer season is upon us. It is a veritable heaven. Green grass abounds all
around, and we are blessed with abundant forests and pure unpolluted rivers. In the
summer, when there is no war, flowers of every colour grow everywhere and the Chechen
earth is rich and fruitful. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What hurts me more than anything is that no Muslim or Arab country
protests our deplorable situation, except for some very brave Palestinians who have lived
all their lives under a brutal occupation of invading Israeli forces. It is only natural
that they sympathize with us, for they have known the horrors of war and occupation for
more than 52 years. The only good thing about my certain imminent death is that I will go
to heaven and to a far, far better place than I have ever been to before. I can only hope
that one day my Muslim brothers will be united and stand against the forces of evil and
oppression. But it just might be too late for the people of my beloved homeland, Chechnya.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Remember, as my fellow freedom fighters struggle against our oppressor and
exterminator, history is written by those who hang heroes. We are the heroes of this
war...the unsung heroes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are heroes in the seaweed. There are children in the morning. They
are leaning out for love. They will lean this way forever. </p>
