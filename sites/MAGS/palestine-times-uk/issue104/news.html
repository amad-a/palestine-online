<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As had been widely expected, and after saying for two months that he would
not accept Israeli maps detailing the second phase of redeployment as stipulated in the
revised Wye Memorandum signed at Sharm el-Sheikh in the autumn of 1999, Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat decided on 5 January 2000 to accept the Israeli plan
&#147;as it is.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 5 January, Palestinian negotiator Sa&#146;eb Ureikat, acting on
instructions from Arafat, told his Israeli counterpart during an &#147;interim-phase
meeting&#148; in West Jerusalem that the PA was simply accepting the maps.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With downcast spirit, Ureikat told reporters that the Palestinians
&#147;made no gains&#148; since the Israeli government refused to accommodate any of the
Palestinian demands concerning the location of the territories slated to be transferred to
the PA&#146;s full or partial administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials had argued all along that Israel alone has the right to
decide which land is to be transferred to the Palestinians, irrespective of PA objections.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, unlike in past redeployments when Israel preferred to hand-over
Palestinian population centres to the PA, this time, arid, sparsely-populated territory
was offered for area (B) where the PA is entitled to have only civilian responsibilities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA officials were taken off-guard by the Israeli logic, prompting one
official to remark, &#147;Are we supposed to look after the welfare of snakes and
scorpions in these areas?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, eventually, on 7 and 8 January, and after the United States made
clear to Arafat that it would not exert pressure on Israel to modify the redeployment
plan, the second phase of redeployment did take place in accordance with the Israeli maps.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, 2% of the West Bank (minus Jerusalem, since Israel does not
recognize that East Jerusalem is part of the West Bank) was transferred from area (B) to
area (A), and 3% from area (C) to area (B).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The areas transferred to the PA administration included villages and
hamlets in the northern and central parts of the West Bank, as well as two former
Jordanian army camps, abandoned by the Israeli army several years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third and final stage of redeployment (according to Wye) is supposed
to take place on 20 January; Israel is supposed to hand over up to 6.1% of the West Bank
to the PA, including some fairly large towns such as Dura, 10 miles south-west of Hebron,
which will become area (A).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Seeking to extenuate their embarrassment of having given in to Israeli
intransigence on the second-redeployment maps, Ureikat claimed that Israel promised that
it would take Palestinian &#147;views&#148; into consideration when implementing the
aforementioned third redeployment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Eran was quick to deny this saying, &#147;We only promised to
listen to them,&#148; suggesting that Israel will unilaterally decide the areas that will
be handed over to the Palestinians in the third redeployment as well.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the third redeployment is carried out, Israel and the PA will still
have to tackle the more important issue of the third grand phase of redeployment,
stipulated in the Oslo Accords.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Declaration of Principles, by the end of the
&#147;interim phase&#148; (as opposed to the final-status talks which began while the
interim phase was far from ending) the Israeli army is suppose to vacate the entirety of
the West Bank save the settlements, military camps and East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the successive Israeli governments, including the current
government of Ehud Barak, voiced a different interpretation of the stipulations to that
effect in the Oslo Accords.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Former Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu said on many occasions
that Israel would not &#147;give up&#148; more than a lone 1% of the West Bank in the
context of the third phase of redeployment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And his successor Barak, though more tight-lipped on the issue, indicated
that he would not cede more than his predecessor was willing to and that he saw no
separation between the interim and the final-status issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Barak made strenuous efforts, with some notable successes, to
merge the interim phase with the final status talks. His strategy to that effect is
illustrated by the fact that Odid Eran is Head of the Israeli negotiating teams for both
the final status talks and the interim phase talks with the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For their part, the Palestinians sought to bring about an absolute
separation between the &#147;two tracks,&#148; by appointing PA information minister
Yasser Abed Rabbou to head its final status talks team while Sa&#146;eb Ureikat remained
chief negotiator for the interim phase issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA&#146;s acceptance of Israel&#146;s virtual dictates on the
redeployment maps suggests that Arafat is now adopting the old adage, &#147;A pigeon in
the hand is better than ten on the branch.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to observers here, Arafat&#146;s retreat stemmed from his
conviction that the final status talks will go nowhere, and that the PA will be in a
better position with up to 40% of the West Bank in case of declaring Palestinian
Statehood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the prevailing thinking in the PA circles is that &#147;we should
get all we can get now before the ultimate crises in the final status talks paralyses the
entire peace process with Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of the above, and if the deadlock in the final status continues,
it would be reasonable to expect Yasser Arafat to declare a Palestinian State sooner
rather than later, either unilaterally or in tacit coordination with Israel and the United
States. Indeed, Arafat cannot embark on a grave step as such without some coordination
with the Jewish State, which is most directly involved in this.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And, predictably, Israel&#146;s consent to the declaration of Palestinian
Statehood would not be without a price.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That price is 40%-45% of the West Bank (as, indeed, Odid Eran made it
clear to Yasser Abed Rabbou during their meeting in Ramallah in the last week of
December), including most of the settlements; Gush Etzion, extending from the southern
suburbs of Jerusalem to the northern outskirts of Hebron; and a 4-kilometre security zone
along the former armistice line between the West Bank and Israel proper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is, of course, unexpected that Arafat will accept the Israeli <i>fait
accompli</i>, since it would fly in the face of United Nations resolutions 242 and 338 and
would be utterly unacceptable to the Palestinians, as well as to Fatah, the political
backbone of his regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, this should not mean that the ageing and increasingly frail
Palestinian leader would not reach at least a tacit &#147;understanding&#148; with Israel
whereby the new situation would be treated as &#147;status quo&#148; recognized by the two
sides but necessarily accepted as &#147;permanent&#148; by either or both of them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this case, the declaration of a small, truncated and deformed
Palestinian State on parts of the West Bank would be the result of the failure of the
peace process (especially if the final status talks remained deadlocked as expected),
rather than a culmination of its success. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, it would be a prescription for the resumption of the
conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and probably also for regional instability as
well.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Human rights violations resulting<br>
from the Oslo process</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">New York -</b> The following text, prepared by the New York-based Center
for Economic and Social Rights (CESR), was circulated during mid-January as a two-part
brief by the Center for Policy Analysis on Palestine. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I. Palestinian Authority Responsibility</b><br>
While not formally recognized as a State under the Oslo process, the Palestinian Authority
(PA) in fact exercises State-like powers through effective control over area (A), now 12%
of the West Bank. (Under the Oslo agreements, Israel presently retains full control over
60% of the West Bank and exercises overriding security jurisdiction over an additional
28%.) Moreover, the PA has a sovereign legal identity as a delegated authority of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which enjoys diplomatic relations with over 125
countries. Under the PLO&#146;s 1988 Declaration of Independence, &#147;The State of
Palestine declares its commitment to . . . the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.&#148; The PA has also made frequent public declarations to abide by human rights
principles.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under the Oslo process, the PA was assigned the unenviable task of
protecting Israeli security (defined as the personal safety of every Israeli) without
sufficient political and economic control to pursue real self-determination or development
for the Palestinian population. Even if Israel fully implements the Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum of September 1999, the PA would control only 18.1% of the West Bank. The
PA&#146;s inability to fulfil the most basic political and economic demands of the people
it claims to represent is one of the major reasons for its widespread violations of human
rights.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">II. PA Human Rights Abuses</b><br>
Abuses by the PA, especially violations of civil and political rights, have been well
documented. In the face of public dissatisfaction and protest over declining living
standards, the PA has clamped down on any public expression of dissent to its policies
under Oslo. The recent campaign of repression against 20 prominent Palestinians (9 of whom
are members of the elected Palestinian Legislative Council) who signed a petition
protesting corruption and political weakness in the PA is only the most recent and
best-publicized example. The PA&#146;s ubiquitous security apparatus relies on
indiscriminate sweeps and arrests, arbitrary detention, military courts and torture. These
illegal measures have not only been demanded by Israel in the name of fighting
&#147;terrorism&#148;, but also condoned by the same donor governments that fund PA
training programmes on the rule of law and good governance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These violations of civil and political rights stem in part from popular
opposition to PA economic policies and practices. According to a 1997 audit conducted by
the Legislative Council, PA officials have mismanaged a staggering 40% of foreign aid and
revenues. Widespread public corruption at the highest levels has been a major factor
causing economic decline, reducing Palestinians&#146; access to health care, education and
other basic services. Moreover, taking advantage of the closure&#146;s restricted access
to external markets, officials close to PA President Yasser Arafat have established
monopolies on most basic goods, leading to sharp price increases. This combination of
corruption and monopolies violates the economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) of
Palestinians.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">III. Violations by International Donors</b><br>
All international actors&#151;not just States&#151;have duties under human rights laws
regardless of whether or not they have ratified specific treaties. The Universal
Declaration mandates that &#147;every individual and every organ of society shall . . .
promote respect for these rights and freedoms.&#148; States and international actors have
been found liable for indirect or third-party support of human rights violations by
others. For example, the International Court of Justice found the U.S. responsible for
abuses committed by Nicaraguan contras backed by the U.S.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under Oslo, international donors have legal obligations. The fact that
European and U.S. funders are bankrolling the Oslo process makes them responsible for
human rights violations committed with these funds. International donors provide a large
share of the PA&#146;s budget yet only earmark 1% of funds for the judiciary and
legislature combined. Most of these funds go to political organs controlled directly by
Arafat, and end up supporting repression. Indeed, the U.S. Agency for International
Development funds have disproportionately financed PA police and security forces. The
astonishing imbalance in foreign funds given to the PA may be the single largest factor in
undermining the rule of law and shaping the increasingly lawless security apparatus in
PA-controlled areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is also disturbing that international donors have not demanded an end
to the Israeli closure, despite the fact that their aid has been diverted away from real
development and toward emergency measures, such as temporary job creation, in effect
subsidizing the closure. Instead, donors have proposed a model for Palestinian economic
development that assumes the continuation of closure. These plans call for more export
processing zones such as Karni at the Eretz military checkpoint on the border of Gaza.
Similar to the <i>maquiladoras</i> at the U.S.-Mexico border, these areas allow Israeli
and foreign capital to exploit cheap Palestinian labour while maintaining a strict closure
confining Palestinians within their enclaves.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">IV. Structural Flaws in the Oslo Framework</b><br>
The recent increase in human rights abuses by Israel, the PA and international donors
stems from structural flaws in the Oslo process itself. The most significant flaw is the
abandonment of established international law in favour of bilateral negotiations between a
strong party and a much weaker one. As a result, the Oslo agreements overwhelmingly
reflect Israeli concerns about its political recognition and its security while either
dismissing central Palestinian concerns or relegating them to undefined &#147;final
status&#148; negotiations. Israel has also exercised its unfettered power to unilaterally
dictate the terms of Oslo&#146;s implementation, effectively crippling the Palestinian
economy through closure and seizing more Palestinian land and resources without facing
public pressure for violating human rights and international law. For its part, the PA has
responded to its political and economic weakness under Oslo by building a formidable
security apparatus to repress popular dissent while instituting a form of
&#147;governance&#148; marked by cronyism and corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The final chapter of the Oslo process is imminent, with final status
negotiations due to conclude by the end of this year. The general shape of the final
agreement is easy to predict: a politically and economically nonviable Palestinian
&#147;State&#148; in isolated enclaves comprising less than 50% of Gaza and the West Bank,
subject to Israeli control, dependent on international aid and brutally policed by
Palestinian security forces.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Expected to bring a measure of prosperity and security to a population
that had suffered 27 years of military occupation, the Oslo process instead has caused an
increase in economic deprivation and human rights violations. The impact can be seen in
higher unemployment rates, lower household incomes, restricted access to such basic
services as health care and education, and severe limitations on freedom of speech and
movement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In essence, Oslo&#146;s structural failure to link peace with human rights
has created a situation in which Palestinians now face double repression from Israel and
their own nascent government. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After Oslo </b></u><br>
The dominant public discourse insists that Oslo is the only viable framework for resolving
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Opposition to Oslo is equated with opposition to peace,
without recognition that any &#147;peace process&#148; built on a foundation of human
rights violations and economic exploitation is not sustainable except through increasing
levels of repression. A just peace in the region based on human rights and international
law offers the best hope for challenging the ongoing economic and political
disenfranchisement of the Palestinian people. </p>

Middle East with only one eye</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin told an American college student delegation he met with on 16 January that the
United States sees the Middle East with only one eye and that the current &#147;peace
process&#148; would bring neither justice for the Palestinians nor security for Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The delegation, headed by Yehuda Looker, Vice President of the George
Mason University, had met with many Israeli and Palestinian leaders in order to be aware
of the various views of the main players in the conflict. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin told the students that the Palestinian people were eager for peace
and justice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;A peace that is void of justice will not be accepted by the people
and therefore will not last long,&#148; Yassin told the American delegation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin pointed out that the resolution of the Palestinian question did not
lie in declaring Palestinian Statehood, but rather in enabling some four million
Palestinian refugees to return to their historical homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Without this, there simply can be no enduring peace.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin said declaring Palestinian Statehood under current circumstances
would not do the Palestinians much good.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;What would we make of a State without land and freedom?&#148; he
asked.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said Israel and the United States would be glad if the Palestinian
cause would be effectively liquidated under the rubric of a deformed Palestinian State on
2% or 3% of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin argued that the refugees were still dispersed throughout the four
corners of the globe, while settlements were being erected on grabbed Arab land in the
West Bank and Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Islamist leader lambasted American policy in the Middle
East, saying &#147;justice was conspicuously absent from that policy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin said the deportation of four Hamas leaders from Jordan to Qatar in
November was &#147;a blunt violation of Jordanian and international laws.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Where in the world does a respectable country deport its
citizens?&#148; he asked.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin said Hamas was the victim of vilification and demonization in the
United States owing to the fact that Zionist Jews control much of the media in the West.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said, &#147;America sees us with one eye&#151;an eye that sees
legitimate resistance against an evil and sinister occupation as terrorism.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He argued that Hamas was not only a military group, but a human, social,

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> Israeli media sought to overplay statements
attributed to Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Goshe in which he reportedly criticized the Muslim
Brothers in Jordan for not adopting Hamas&#146; strategy for the liberation of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli radio and television spoke of &#147;a serious rift&#148;
between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli State-run radio quoted experts as saying that
&#147;Goshe&#146;s statements were reflecting the predicament of Hamas abroad.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the Zionist media suggested that the deportation by the
Jordanian government of four Hamas leaders two months ago contributed to strengthening the
&#147;local leadership.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel, Hamas&#146; arch enemy, gloated over the deportation of the four
Islamist leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli Mossad sought unsuccessfully nearly two years ago to
assassinate in Amman Khalid Misha&#146;al, the head of Hamas politburo.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jordan was believed to have carried out the deportation under pressure
from the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A Jordanian newspaper, <i>Al-Arab al-Yawm</i>, on 23 January quoted Goshe
as saying that the Muslim Brotherhood played a hesitant role in the crisis between Hamas
and the Jordanian government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last
month moved to defuse the recent tension between his Palestinian Islamic resistance
movement and the Muslim Brothers of Jordan which was caused by Mr. Ghoshe&#146;s
statements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Goshe had accused the Muslim Brothers' leadership of abandoning the
Palestinian cause and of not doing enough to prevent the Jordanian government from
deporting Hamas officials from Amman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin spoke via telephone with Jamil Abu Baker, the official spokesperson
of the Muslim Brothers in Amman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Abu Baker, Yassin emphasized the umbilical relationship
between Hamas and the Muslim Brothers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas generally follows the same ideological line of the Muslim Brothers,
which calls for the reinstitution of the Islamic political authority throughout the Muslim
world. </p>

accuses Arafat of gangsterism</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ramallah-</b> A Palestinian Legislative council member accused Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yaser Arafat of &#147;gangster-like behavior&#148; and &#147;of
personalizing Palestinian politics and polity.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Azmi Shua&#146;ebi castigated what he called the &#147;state of
lawlessness throughout the Palestinian society&#148; which he said &#147;was being
fostered by Arafat&#146;s supporters who couldn&#146;t do what they do without a green
light from him.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shua&#146;ebi pointed out that while the PA claims that there is only one
authority, pro-Arafat militias and thugs often scour the streets of the West Bank,
intimidating civilians by firing into the air.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, scores of masked Fatah activists rampaged through the streets
of Ramallah, firing into the air from their automatic weapons in full view of PA police.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA officials refused to comment on the incident, saying, &#147;it is being
dealt with at the highest level.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last December, Fatah thugs shot Palestinian Legislative Council member
Mu&#146;awiya al Masri three times in the leg after he had signed a petition exposing
widespread graft and corruption in the PA regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another co-signer, councilor and former minister Abdul Jawad Saleh, was
also assaulted and badly hurt by General Intelligence thugs while visiting interned fellow
petitioners in a Jericho lockup. </p>

of war crimes against Lebanese</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- </b>The Israeli human rights group, B&#146;Tselem,
accused Israel committing serious human rights violations that constitute war crimes in
the Israeli occupied &#147;security zone&#148; in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The group issued a 67-page report, illustrating the various forms of human
rights violations by the Israeli occupation army.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It pointed out that the occupation army &#147;flagrantly and continuously
violates fundamental human rights of Lebanese civilians &#147;either directly through its
own armed forces or indirectly through its south Lebanese army (SLA).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report cited several forms of human rights violations, including the
extra-judicial detention and torture of Lebanese by the SLA of at the militia&#146;s
notorious Khayam Jail, the abduction of Lebanese and their imprisonment without trail in
Israel where they are held as &#147;bargaining chips&#148; for information on the fate of
missing Israeli soldiers, the expulsion of residents from the zone by the SLA and its
practice of forcible conscription, including minors.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report also pointed out to the indiscriminate firing in violation of
the rules of war and the use by the Israeli army of weapons such as phosphorous shells
that fire thousands of darts in circumstances that have killed and wounded civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report said these violations whether committed directly or indirectly
constitute war crimes under international law. </p>

information on missing soldier</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- The Israeli government has expressed
disappointment at Hizbullah refusal to respond to the release by the Israeli occupation
authorities of 15 Lebanese hostages last December, Israeli sources said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel was hoping that the release of the Lebanese hostages would lead to
some insight about the whereabouts of missing Israeli air navigator Ron Arad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel still holds 16 Lebanese hostages without charge or trial, some for
more than ten years.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There had been unofficial reports that the release of the five hostages
was part of a three way deal involving Israel, Lebanon and Germany, whereby Israel would
receive information about Arad, Iran would ameliorate the plight of 13 Jews on trial for
treason, a German citizen sentenced to death in Iran would be freed and the five Lebanese
hostages would go home.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hizbullah official Naim Kasem has said that his organization would seek to
get information about Arad to obtain the release of the remaining 16 hostages, including
Mustafa Dirani and Sheikh Abdul Karim Obid.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The Palestinian Authority is reportedly planning
to open a large nightclub in the West Bank of Jericho.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources in Jericho said the nightclub would include a bar, a
large dance hall and &quot;recreational facilities&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sources said the building housing the nightclub was being constructed
not far away from the &quot;Oasis Casino&quot;, considered one of the largest in the
Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A spokesman for the Jericho municipal council said he was not aware of any
plans to that effect.</p>

refused to elaborate on an Israeli newspaper report suggesting that he had indicated to
U.S. President Bill Clinton that he was willing to waive the Palestinian refugees' right
of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said Arafat refused to answer several questions on the
subject before he left Gaza for Davus, Switzerland, to take part in the International
Economic Forum.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several Palestinian Authority officials have denied the report.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, those officials may only be speaking for themselves since they
are not part of the decision-making process in the autocratic regime of Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, many Palestinian civic leaders have begun a campaign to alert
Palestinians at home and in the Diaspora against a possible sell-out of the refugees'
rights by Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources indicated that the coming weeks and months were likely
to witness high-profile activities to that effect.</p>

Ikrema Sabri, warned the Zionist regime against &#147;tampering with the issue of al-Aqsa
Mosque,&#148; saying, &#147;this issue is an exclusive Muslim affair and Israel has no

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri described Islamic holy places in Jerusalem as &#147;absolute red

al-Aqsa Mosque is the ultimate red line for Muslims here and everywhere,&#148; the
Palestinian daily <i>al-Ayyam </i>quoted Sabri as saying. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri&#146;s remarks came after Israeli extremists petitioned the Israeli
Supreme Court to stop renovation work on al-Aqsa Mosque carried out by Wakf authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sabri said the Holy Shrine of al-Aqsa Mosque was and would continue to be
outside the confines of the jurisdiction of Israeli courts, adding that the &#147;issue

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT), large numbers

handed over to them. The one exception was a 14-year-old who was arrested on 22 December.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the children&#146;s lawyer, Khalid Quzmar, they were taken
for interrogation at Beit Eal detention centre, near Ramallah, immediately following their
arrest, without allowing the children to sleep. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During interrogation, it was reported that two of the children were beaten
and the others were threatened with physical abuse, and confessions were extracted from

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the time of the arrests, four of the minors (ages between 12 and 13)
