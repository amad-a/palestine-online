<H3><CENTER>The Peace Accords and Netanyahu's Referendum</CENTER></H3>

<P>he fact that the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu is actually considering
a nationwide vote to decide the fate of any plan to hand over more of the
West Bank to Palestinian rule not only violates the peace accords between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority but is ludicrous as well.<BR>
Naturally, the vote is for Israelis only and has nothing to do with the
opinion of the Palestinians themselves.  Since when, in fact, were the Palestinians
ever asked how they felt about giving up their property, human rights and
lives to Israelis, most of whom invaded and took over a land and country
that was not theirs to take over?<BR>
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has successfully resisted a U.S. proposal
to break the 15-month old peace deadlock and give Palestinians more self-rule
on the dwindling remains of their former country.  Yet, his resistance comes
as no surprise either, for Israel is the monster that Frankenstein created.
 America, the Frankenstein, has constantly made all efforts to turn a blind
eye to the wrongdoings of the Israeli Government as well as to the atrocities
perpetrated by the Israelis themselves.<BR>
The very idea of peace has so far only benefited Israelis.  Nowhere, in
what is left of Palestine or in the neighbouring country of Jordan, have
the accords made life easier, better, or more economically stable.  Sadly
enough, matters have worsened for many Palestinians as well as Jordanians.<BR>
In Jordan, Israelis are reportedly buying land right and left and investing
in industries while the average Jordanian is unable to afford the basic
necessities of life.  In Palestinian self-rule areas, life is more difficult
than ever before, and the Palestinians of the West Bank are separated from
those in the Gaza Strip as if the two entities are merely two huge concentration
camps. Meanwhile, the people live a miserable life under the Palestinian
Authority and the Israeli occupation authorities.<BR>
As Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian Higher Education Minister told Reuters,
&quot;One does not have referenda on the implementation of signed agreements.
 It's clear it is a pretext to cater to domestic politics, and also to buy
more time to create more facts and to avoid more implementation.&quot;<BR>
How can there ever be peace when the Palestinians have no rights and when
Bibi insists that the city of Jerusalem will be the undivided capital of
Israel forever?<BR>
Peace can only occur when the rights of all are taken into consideration
and when there is justice for all parties concerned.  It is unfair that
the Palestinians be asked to give up more of their land and homes when hardly
anything is left of what was once their country.  There can never be peace
in the Middle East or in Palestine itself as long as the Palestinians have
no say in their own affairs, as long as Jerusalem is Jewish, and as long
as Palestinian land, homes and lives are taken without any regard to what
is moral or right.<BR>
What would be a much better referendum for Bibi to conduct would be a moral
assessment of the way Israel was established and how a whole country of
an innocent people was taken away from them against their will, how millions
of Palestinian refugees have no hope of ever returning to their land and
how countless innocent Palestinian civilians, including women and children,
have been massacred in order to appease the appetite of a Frankenstein,
who obviously has no moral conscience and is ruthless in his behaviour towards
the Palestinians, who still dare to dwell on what is left of their own land.<BR>
