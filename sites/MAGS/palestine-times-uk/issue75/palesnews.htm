<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>1500 Figures Participate in Popular Jerusalem
Conference</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>				By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> 1,500 people attended the opening of the two-day Popular
Jerusalem Conference that began in Amman, Jordan on 20 August 1997.  Participants
hailed from 20 different countries to show support for Jerusalem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Conference began with a recitation from the Qur&iacute;an
and the singing of the &igrave;Jerusalem Nasheed&icirc; by the band Farqat
Al-Rawaby. Speeches were then given by the President of the Preparatory
Committee of the Conference Dr. Ishaq Al-Farhan, who is the General Secretary
of the Islamic Action Front Party,  and by Suleyman Arar, the General Secretary
of the Arab Parties Secretariat. There were other speeches and then elections
for the president, vice-president and secretaries. Dr. Ishaq Al-Farhan was
elected to be the president of the Conference and nine deputies were appointed
as vice-presidents.  Suleyman Arar was one of the deputies.  The eight remaining
deputies were chosen from other parties from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq,
Malaysia, Libya and Palestine. Three sub-committees were elected:  (1) Committee
for the Strategic Popular Act to Defend Jerusalem; (2) Committee for the
Jerusalem Charter; and (3) Drafting Committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The second day was spent discussing the charter and recommendations,
which had to be agreed upon before the day&iacute;s end.  Other participants
in the Conference included 11 Jordanian opposition parties, the Future Party,
the Muslim Brotherhood and independent political parties. The Conference
was composed of mostly those participants living outside of Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why is Palestine, and Jerusalem in particular, so important
to these people? Abdul-Hady Awang, the deputy of the Islamic Party in Malaysia
and a member of the Malaysian Parliament, states:  &igrave;Palestine is
the land of the Prophets, and Muslims believe in all the Prophets....Jerusalem
was the first Qibla (direction of prayer) that Muslims used to pray towards,
and it is the third holiest place in Islam. Jerusalem was where the Prophet
visited during Al-Isra&iacute; and Al-Miraj (The Night Journey and the Ascent).
 Muslims recognize all Prophets, including Israelite Prophets. Muslims accept
Christians and their holy sites and their beliefs are respected as well
as the Jews being allowed to hold prayers. In the beginning of Islam, history
shows Muslims were tolerant until the Crusaders came. When the Jews ruled
Palestine, they did not have the same tolerance.&icirc;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Hamad Al-Farhan, a member of the Jordanian Upper House
of Representatives and a member of the Preparatory Committee of the conference,
also stated his view of the importance of Jerusalem.  He gave two reasons.
&igrave;First, the Arabs around Palestine consider the losing of Jerusalem
as a sign of losing all of Palestine. Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims. It
is more sacred than the Vatican is to Christians.  Jerusalem&iacute;s sacredness
is connected to the Prophet Mohammed {may the peace and blessings of God
be upon him) while the Vatican is not connected to Jesus but to his followers.&igrave;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Many people view the moving of the American embassy as
a disaster. Ibrahim Ghosheh, spokesman of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), said this will have &igrave;a bad effect because it means the U.S.
was a big liar for all the previous periods when it put itself as a mediator
and then it recognizes both East and West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.&icirc;
 Hamad Al-Farhan states that this decision made people feel defenceless.
 &igrave;We are not strong enough to challenge America.  Why??...America
as a world leader said its policy would not allow Jerusalem to be Israel&iacute;s
centre until the conflict is resolved.  Then suddenly it did.  People were
repulsed. How can America support a state that is aggressive to the principles
of Western Civilization?... It is an insult to humanity that a big leader
of politics commits such a cheap act.&igrave; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	When asked how the status of Jerusalem affects the peace
process, Ibrahim Ghosheh replied, &igrave;I didn&iacute;t use the words
&euml;peace process&iacute;.  Islamists don&iacute;t believe in the peace
process&oacute;it is an artificial one. The battle of Jerusalem is coming.
What&iacute;s happening now is against the just and the fair.  America and
the West believe in their hearts that they&iacute;re supporting the wrong
side, which is not just and who are not the owner of Jerusalem and Palestine.&icirc;
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	When asked to evaluate the Conference, Ibrahim Ghosheh
stated that &igrave;This is the first time the real policy of the Palestinian,
Arab and Muslim people put their beliefs clearly in rejecting Zionism and
the Israeli state and requesting liberation of both East and West Jerusalem
and reinforcing that Jerusalem is the capital for Palestine.&icirc;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Abdel-Aziz Al-Sayyed, the General Coordinator of the Conference
and the Secretary of the Arab Parties Secretariat, states that &igrave;What
made the Conference so successful were the documents it issued.&icirc; 
One is the Jerusalem Charter, which is expected to be signed by millions
of Muslims.  People have already begun to sign it. Also, a strategy was
made for defending Jerusalem and occupied Palestinian land.  He continued:
 &igrave;We hope the plans will be put into action politically and educationally.
 There are also plans in dealing with the media.  These plans will be carried
out by the parties and personalities who shared in the Conference. It will
be carried on in all Arab and Muslim countries by Palestine and Jerusalem
popular committees which exist in all these countries.&icirc;  He also stated
the fact that &igrave;Jerusalem and Palestine need regular conferences until
Jerusalem and Palestine and all other occupied Arab lands are liberated
from Zionist aggression and oppression.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It was decided that conferences would be held every year
in a different country. The Jerusalem Charter would be translated into English,
French and Spanish for other Muslims to sign.  The cooperative spirit of
the members of the Conference surely must bear successful fruits in the
near future.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Home Demolitions, Israel's Continuous Policy
</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While the Clinton Administration sends envoys to Jerusalem
to denounce &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot;, the Netanyahu government has
stepped up its campaign of provoking already frustrated Palestinians using
a variety of excessive measures. The most graphic of these is the demolition
of Palestinian homes in the West Bank. In the past week alone, over thirty
&quot;unlicensed&quot; Arab homes have been bulldozed and dynamited by Israeli
military forces. This comes at a time when the U.S. and Israel are pressuring
a weary PA President Yasser Arafat to do  more to crackdown on militants
in the areas under his &quot;control.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;We are in a very difficult situation here,&quot;
says Mohammed Ibrahim, a political advisory to Arafat in Gaza.  &quot;On
one hand, we are told to smash any opposition to Israel from our own people,
while at the same time the Israelis are provoking our people by using collective
measures.  There is a very great level of frustration here that no leader
can control in the absence of political accommodation.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the wake of the July 30 suicide bombings in Jerusalem,
which left </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>over a dozen Israelis dead, the Netanyahu government imposed
a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza, making it impossible to move
even between villages and towns. Workers were idle, produce did not move
to markets and millions of dollars were further lost in an illegal form
of collective punishment imposed on over two million people.  In addition,
the Israeli government openly violated the Oslo Accords and international
law by withholding to the PA tax money taken from Palestinian workers, as
outlined in the &quot;peace&quot; agreement.  Even more distressing, however,
is the increase in home demolitions, which threatens, according to former
Netanyahu advisor Ret.-Gen. Oren Shahour, to &quot;spark greater violence
in the territories.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In an open disregard for the presence of U.S. envoy Dennis
Ross, who seemingly cares little about the rights of the Palestinians anyway,
ten Palestinian homes were destroyed in Jerusalem and the West Bank on August
13. This came at the same time that Ross was twisting Arafats arm to further
control Hamas and Islamic Jihad.  &quot;The PA is becoming the soldiers
for Israel.  They are not here anymore to protect our people but to protect
the security of the settlers,&quot; says an exasperated merchant George
Barbour in Bethlehem. &quot;People are losing their faith in our authority
because they are not doing anything to stop the Israelis from taking our
land and destroying our homes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Israelis claim house demolitions are legal because
they were built without permits.  It is a well-known fact that the Israeli
military authority and the Jerusalem municipality rarely issue building
permits to Arabs.   Palestinians, faced with a huge housing crisis in Jerusalem
and its surrounding villages and refugee camps, must build without Israeli
compliance.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;We do not have the same low mortgages or tax breaks
like the settlers to build homes here,&quot; explained Mazen Al Mimi,  whose
home was destroyed after he built seeking relief from the crowded Shou'fat
refugee camp .  &quot;We invested our life-savings in this home and they
came and took that all away from me in one day.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	As Ross and the CIA tried to impose PA security cooperation
with Israel, five homes were destroyed in Shou'fat camp, which faces the
illegal Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev, where 30,000 Jewish residents
live on confiscated Arab land.  While Palestinian homes are destroyed, Pisgat
Zeev expands onto the land of Shou'fat and Anata villages.  The nearby refugee
camp houses 8,000 Palestinian Jerusalemites who are still waiting for justice
following their expulsion from their villages in 1948.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	West Bank settlements are currently seeing a great housing
boom, with construction taking place all over the territories.  It is this
mixture of home demolitions at the same time of settlement expansion that
results in the outbreak of violence among an increasingly frustrated Palestinian
population.     </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to human rights monitoring groups in Palestine,
since the Oslo Accords were signed and the era of &quot;peace and reconciliation&quot;
began, 270 Palestinian homes have been destroyed by Israel.  Ninety-two
of those were under the Rabin/Peres governments, suggesting that this policy
is not just that of the anti-Oslo Netanyahu government.  It is clear, however,
that the Likud government employs these measures at an even greater rate
than the previous Labor government.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On May 18, 1997, Israeli Defense Ministry officials stated
that 500 Palestinian homes have been targeted for demolition.   Since the
election of Prime Minister Netanyahu on May 29, 1996, nearly 180 homes have
already been destroyed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;It seems quite clear that the Israeli military authorities
attempt to cleanse areas of the West Bank and Jerusalem of a Palestinian
presence is to establish favorable population facts prior to the final status
peace negotiations,&quot; says PA Minister Faisal Husseini. &quot;The home
demolitions are part of the same strategy that we see at Jebal Abu- Ghneim
and Ras Al-Amud settlements. They are talking about peace but actually supporting
policies of war.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Husseini is right: The Israeli authorities rely on &quot;legal&quot;
pretexts concerning the lack of building permits in order to legitimize
their current policy of demolishing homes and removing a Palestinian presence
from Areas C near Jewish settlements, bypass roads and military installations.
 Should Netanyahu be forced to actually participate in the final-status
talks, which seem pretty unlikely, he hopes by then that there will be little
for the Palestinians to actually negotiate about, especially in East Jerusalem.
 It then seems pretty clear then that more Palestinians will lose their
homes in the coming months  from an Israeli government seeking to reduce
the number of Arabs in areas that they plan to keep.     </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Everyday a new generation of Palestinian refugees are
created by Israeli home demolitions in the West Bank.  This comes while
the refugees from 1948 and 1967 still wait in squalid camps for some form
of compensation and justice.  It is easy then to see where the motivations
for suicide bombers comes from. One just has to look at the face of hungry
Palestinian children sitting on the  rubble of what was their home to understand
that this so-called peace process cannot outlast efforts by the Israeli
government to provoke Palestinians to react in frustration to the loss of
their homes and land.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians hail &quot;National Unity talks&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Palestinians from various political orientations have
hailed the &quot;National Unity Conference,&quot; held in Gaza on 20 August,
describing it as &quot;our response to Israeli insolence and morbid efforts
to fan the flames of war amongst our people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;National unity should be a fixed Palestinian strategy
in the face of (Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin) Netanyahu's sinister efforts
to strangle our people and narrow our horizons,&quot; said Muhammed Khalid,
a prominent Hamas leader in the Jenin area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is clear that Netanyahu wants to see Palestinians
shed their own blood in order to appease his own cannibalistic instincts.
We must not allow him to realize his diabolic dream,&quot; added Khalid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jamal Shubaki, a Legislative Council member and refugee
from pre-1967 Palestine, concurred, saying &quot;that not under any circumstances
should the Palestinian Authority give deference to Israeli demands to repress
a significant sector of our citizens.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Our strategy should be to cooperate with, rather
than fight, the Islamist camp. This policy shouldn't be a seasonal reaction
to Israeli insolence and oppression, but a principled strategy independent
of all other considerations,&quot; said Shubaki in a radio interview recently.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Gaza, the National Unity Conference was opened at the
Rashad al Shawwa Centre, under the chairmanship of Palestine Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas representative, Abdul Aziz al Rantisi called on Arafat
&quot;to abandon the Oslo Agreement because it utterly failed to restore
our rights and dealt a painful blow to national unity.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This agreement has forced us into a dark tunnel at
the end of which there is no glimmer of hope or flicker of light,&quot;
said Rantisi before a speechless Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, Rantisi called on the PA to see to it that
human rights are respected and the authority of law and order be made to
prevail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, Sheikh Nafez Azzam of the Islamic Jihad organization
reiterated his movement's implacable rejection of the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This agreement has given Israel all the assets and
us all the liabilities,&quot; said Azzam.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamist leader also called on the PA to boycott a
regional economic conference scheduled to be held in Qatar in November.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Azzam labelled the conference &quot;the economic normalization
conference,&quot; exhorting the PA not to play the role of &quot;a normalization
middle-man between Israeli and the Arab world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Low Incentives</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While Arafat is not expected to heed Hamas and Islamic
Jihad calls for &quot;terminating Oslo,&quot; he does seem to be trying
to reach a certain common ground with the Islamist camp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, Arafat's costly refusal to succumb completely to
Israeli dictates is likely to be vindicated and could pay off in terms of
enhancing his position in the occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The fact that Hamas decided, somewhat hastily and without
any reservations, to participate in the Gaza talks suggests that the Movement
is showing a certain gratitude for Arafat's reluctance to clamp down on
its activists and infrastructure as incessantly demanded by the Israelis
and the Americans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Arafat is not being altruistic toward Hamas. The Chairman
seems to realize that Netanyahu is after him just as much as Hamas, and
that Netanyahu is interested in weakening him by making him fight Hamas
on behalf of Israel in return for nothing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In the past Arafat fought Hamas with a vigour because
he thought the peace process would pay off eventually. Now, the Chairman
nearly lost this glimmer of hope, hence he has no incentives to fight Hamas,&quot;
said an &quot;insider&quot; close to the Chairman.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A modus vivendi with Hamas?</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>-  <B>by
Khalid Amayreh</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a step meant as a hint to Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu that the Palestinians can resort to &quot;other options if necessary,&quot;
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat convened and chaired the so-termed
&quot;National Unity Forum.&quot;  The conference, held in Gaza on 20 August
and a day later in Ramallah, was apparently aimed at reaching a modicum
of national Palestinian concordance in the face of the unprecedentedly draconian
Israeli measures imposed on the occupied territories in the aftermath of
the 30 July suicide bombing in West Jerusalem. Unlike previous dialogue
sessions which were largely boycotted by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad on
the grounds that they lacked substance, the Islamist participation was conspicuous
this time, drawing angry Israeli reactions and vociferous accusations that
&quot;Arafat was colluding with terrorists rather than fighting them&quot;.
 The participation of Hamas in the two-day conference was meant, at least
in part, to show gratitude to the PA leadership for not succumbing to Israeli
dictates to clamp down on the Islamists under the elusive rubric of &quot;fighting
terrorism.&quot; However, Hamas representatives at the conference were careful
enough to draw a definitive line between &quot;gratitude&quot; and political
stance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Mr. president, I call on you to abandon the Oslo
Agreement because it utterly failed to restore our rights and dealt a painful
blow to our national unity,&quot; Hamas senior representative Abdul Aziz
al Rantisi said in an unfaltering tone, addressing Chairman Arafat. Rantisi,
once the spokesman of the 400 Islamist activists deported by the late Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in December 1991, went on telling Arafat that
&quot;this Agreement has forced us into a dark tunnel at the end of which
there is no flicker of light or glimmer of hope.&quot; The Islamist leader
continued, saying &quot;therefore, Mr. President, resistance of every kind
is the right way to confront the occupation...we must leave the Oslo plan,
which Israel uses as a weapon against us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rantisi's remarks were essentially echoed by the representative
of Hamas' more radical sister, the Islamic Jihad. The group's representative,
Dr. Nafez Azzam described the Oslo Accords as &quot;the original sin,&quot;
saying the &igrave;Accords gave Israel all the assets and left to us all
the liabilities...Israel will never alter its behaviour toward us, whether
we are for or against the peace process.&quot;  Moreover, Azzam exhorted
Arafat to boycott the regional economic conference slated to be held in
Qatar in November. &quot;This is not a conference for economic development
but one for economic normalization; we should not allow ourselves to serve
as economic middlemen between the Zionist entity and the Arab world,&quot;
said Azzam, as Arafat looked on speechless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While Arafat is not expected to heed the Islamists call
for &quot;terminating Oslo&quot; (because that would mean terminating the
PA itself, as well), he does seem to be trying to reach a certain common
ground with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, purely for his own expediency.
 Arafat's and the PA's popularity had reached an all-time low among Palestinians
even before the 30 July suicide bombing in West Jerusalem.  The revelation
of the massive corruption scam in the PA seriously undermined the president's
image, projecting him as one presiding over a corrupt entity made up of
officials and ministers who are essentially preoccupied with embezzling
public money rather than serving their country.  Added to that is the crippling,
ongoing Israeli siege on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which effectively
paralysed the originally fragile Palestinian economy and exposed the vulnerability
and inherent weakness of the Palestinian Authority. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with a serious credibility crisis at home (stemming
from his increasingly manifest inability to justify continuing to walk along
the Oslo path) and throttling Israeli pressures that would, in case he submitted
to them,  remove the remaining &quot;fig leaf&quot; by exposing him completely
naked as an Israeli security tool not unlike the Israeli-backed militia
in Southern Lebanon, Arafat must have reasoned that he cannot afford to
be &quot;too responsive&quot; to Israeli dictates.  More to the point, the
Palestinian leader may have realized that the current Israeli government
was &quot;after him as much as it is after Hamas,&quot; a theory corroborated
by the recent revelation in Foreign Affairs that Israel was preparing a
hit team to assassinate Yasser Arafat and other leading PA officials.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Still more, Arafat feels immensely &quot;betrayed and deceived&quot;
by Netanyahu whom Palestinian sources contend &quot;wants to see Arafat
act at Israel's beck and call in return for nothing.&quot; This point was
reportedly related to Arafat by his more militant Fatah leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;In the past, Arafat fought Hamas with vigour and
some determination because he thought the peace process would eventually
pay off. Now the Chairman has nearly lost this glimmer of hope, thus losing
the incentive to fight Hamas,&quot; intimated an &quot;insider&quot; close
the Chairman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, Arafat doesn't seem about to embrace Hamas,
let alone meet its &quot;unrealistic demands.&quot; The most he seems to
aspire to achieve is a form of modus vivendi with the Islamist movement
that would give him greater maneuverability and ward off Israeli charges
and pressures.  The Palestinian leader must have realized by now that the
&quot;stick-policy&quot; alone is utterly inadequate in dealing with a movement
as big and as influential as Hamas and that it is wiser to try to convince
rather than coerce Hamas to see the overall advantage of &quot;suspending
attacks on Israel for the time being.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, in the absence of any Palestinian strategy to
counter the Israeli &quot;arrogance of power,&quot; as manifested in the
frantic settlement expansion onslaught in the West Bank and East Jerusalem,
 any modus vivendi with Hamas would be proven untenable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, even if Hamas decided to exercise a degree of &quot;national
responsibility,&quot; e.g. by refraining from carrying out attacks on Israeli

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel demolishes more Arab Homes in Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation bulldozers destroyed three additional
Palestinian homes at the Ras al Amud neighborhood in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources in Jerusalem said two Israeli bulldozers
destroyed the three houses shortly before noon Wednesday, rendering three
families homeless.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A spokesman for the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert,
justified the brutal act on the ground  that the three premises were built
without license.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Palestinians point out that licensing is only
a pretext, arguing that demolition of Arab houses in East Jerusalem, as
it is in the West Bank, is an established Israeli policy aimed at checking
Arab demographic growth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;House demolition is consistent with the undeclared
Israeli policy of preventing the Arab population in the city from exceeding
the 27% -line,&quot; said Faisal Husseini, member of the PLO executive committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Husseini pointed out that Israeli municipal authorities
in East Jerusalem refuse to issue building licenses for Palestinians inside
the city for racist reasons pertaining to the ethnic cleansing policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They don't want to see more Palestinians here,&quot;
said Husseini</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday,  a prominent Israeli journalist and writer,
Uri Avneri, disclosed that the successive Israeli governments adopted an
undeclared policy  against Arab demographic expansion and growth in East
Jerusalem soon after the Israeli occupation in June 1967.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Writing in the Hebrew daily Ma'ariv, Avneiri pointed out
that Labour and Likud governments alike committed themselves to maintain
the proportion of non-Jews (the Arabs) in Jerusalem at the 27 % point, the
same percentage in 1967.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faced with a crushing housing shortage stemming from natural
growth in their population and the scarcity of building licenses, many East
Jerusalemite Palestinians are forced to seek shelter in surrounding areas
such as Bethlehem and Ram, thus risking withdrawal of their residency rights
by the Israeli authorities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They are launching a demographic genocide against
us in the full view of the world...they don't allow us to build shelters
for our children, and when we go elsewhere to seek one, they tell us &quot;you
no longer have the right to live in Jerusalem,&quot; said Abdul Hamid Nasser
Addin,  a Jerusalemite Arab who lost his residency right in Jerusalem because
he moved to a new house in the Ram neighborhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development,  Israeli soldiers prevented a group
of Christian clergymen from reaching their church in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The clergymen, along with civic leaders and Legislative
Council members from Bethlehem, walked to the Israeli army roadblock near
the settlement of Gilo north of Bethlehem, hoping to be allowed to proceed
to Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the soldiers turned them back, threatening to
shoot them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Bethlehem has been under a tight siege for a month, sparking
off violent protests by townspeople.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Tuesday,  26 August, as many as 40 school girls fainted
after their school was bombarded with tear gas shells by Israeli soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government has so far refused to lift the siege
on Bethlehem  allegedly for security reasons.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday, the Israeli War minister, Yitzhak Mordachai,
said the siege on the Palestinian town would continue for the foreseeable
future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli government has been demanding that the Palestinian
Authority destroy the social, economic and educational infrastructure of
Hamas, an allusion to hospitals, schools, universities and charitable institutions
run by Islamists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, the Palestinian Authority has refused to the Zionist
dictates.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli soldiers reportedly raided several mosques in the
Hebron area on 11 August, desecrating the holy places and, in a clear provocation,
treading on copies of the Holy Qur'an.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources in Dura, 10 miles south-west of Hebron,
said scores of Israeli soldiers raided the Grand Mosque in Dura at 2:30
a.m. allegedly to &quot;look for inciteful materials&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The mosque muezzin, Subhi al Masalmeh, said soldiers smashed
glass inside the mosque.  One soldier, he said, trod on copies of the Holy
Qur'an in his full view probably to test his reaction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Masalmeh said the soldiers desisted from the sacrilegious
act only when al Masalmeh complained to his superior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Israeli troops raided Masjid al Mujahed three
blocks away, smashing furniture and glass.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Afterwards, the soldiers raided the Al Anwar Athletic and
Cultural Club to carry out &quot;security searches.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Qazzaz, who supervises cultural activities at the
Club, said &quot;the soldiers turned everything upside down, but found nothing
that would incriminate us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They came looking for inciteful material and perhaps
more than that, but found bags and pencils for school children,&quot; Qazzaz
said, referring to a school paraphernalia sale at the Club for low income
families in the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, Israeli occupation troops
have raided as many as 50 mosques throughout the West Bank since the 30
July double suicide bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At least 20 mosques were closed down for varying periods
of time and as many as 50 imams were rounded up as an act of reprisal against
the Islamic movement which Israel blames for responsibility for the bombing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli sources said that the number of Palestinians rounded
up since the bombing reached 300, half of which were reportedly sent to
detention and concentration camps inside Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel treats Palestinian detainees as hostages and makes
their release conditional on receiving political concessions from Yasser
Arafat's political Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, Israel and the PA have not established the identity
of the perpetrators of the bombing.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Following the suicide bombings.. Israel imposes</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>closure on West Bank and Gaza</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In retaliation for the 30 July suicide bombing in West
Jerusalem, the Israeli government imposed a &quot;total closure&quot; on
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, cutting off Arab towns and villages individually
from each other and collectively from the outside world.  Consequently,
many vital supplies and services, including those usually taken for granted,
were stopped due to IDF blockades of Palestinian population centres. In
several instances, patients died and women had to give birth at military
roadblocks, having been denied access to nearby hospitals.  Moreover, the
collective &quot;town-arrest&quot; seems to have inflicted incalculable
damage to the originally fragile Palestinian economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Authority sources described the draconian Israeli
measures as &quot;unprecedented in harshness&quot; and &quot;aimed at subjugating
and humiliating our people.&quot; PA Chairman Yasser Arafat termed the Israeli
reprisals as a &quot;criminal act of genocidal proportions&quot; and amounting
to a &quot;declaration of war,&quot; a description repeatedly echoed by
his aides and ministers.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speaking during a press conference in Gaza on 4 August,
the Palestinian leader accused Israel of &quot;tightening the noose on the
Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people instead of fighting terrorism.&quot;
Arafat's desperate words did carry an air of veracity. The Israeli measures,
probably the harshest ever, virtually paralysed the PA as it forced Palestinian
officials &quot;to hibernate, each in his immediate place of residence,&quot;
as one official put it. For some officials, the &quot;claustrophobia&quot;
was so acute, that media celebrities such as Nabil Sha'ath publicly complained
on the air to a Voice of Israel reporter &quot;to help me if you can because
I'm stranded in Gaza due to the closure.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hafez al Barghouthi, Editor-in-Chief of the pro-PA daily,
 al Hayatul Jadida, marvelled at the effects of the Israeli measures in
preventing terrorism.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I don't understand anymore&icirc;, he sarcastically
wrote in his daily column on 5 August, &quot;how the dumping of a truck-load
of earth at village entrances would prevent a would-be terrorist from proceeding
to his ultimate destination...Nor how barring newspapers from reaching Gaza
would contribute to fighting terror...unless one takes into account the
plausible possibility that a terrorist could very well fold himself in paper
form or be resurrected from one of the obituaries.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ostensibly, the collective punishment is meant to induce
the PA to crack down on Hamas on behalf of Israel and also to &quot;further
narrow Palestinians' horizons&quot; in the hope that they would come to
terms with the Israeli fait accompli.  However, it is seemingly unlikely
that the Israeli policy would achieve the desired goal on both levels. The
PA, which has never been weaker among Palestinians, is not in a position
to openly and unashamedly act at Benyamin Netanyahu's beck and call as this
would quicken its demise in the eyes of the Palestinians and decisively
vindicate the often-voiced charges that it is merely an Israeli puppet militia
aimed at tormenting the Palestinians and ravaging their collective psychological
immunity vis-&brvbar;-vis Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, a wholesale crackdown on Hamas and the Islamic Jihad
under Israel's incessant dictates would conceivably strengthen the Islamists
in Palestinian opinion. It could also corrode the already frail political
constituencies on which Arafat has based his leadership and orchestrated
his support for the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, this seems to explain why the PA has not yet embarked
on &quot;an all-out campaign of mass arrests&quot; of Islamist elements
as was done following the spate of suicide bomb attacks in Israel in the
spring of 1996. But there are other important reasons militating against
a decision to that effect.  The PA has come to feel that Hamas is no longer
the sole sought-after enemy by Israel and that Fateh, the PA itself and,
indeed, the &quot;collective Palestinian interest&quot; would eventually
be, more or less, ultimate targets for Israeli insolence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This view was recently echoed by Abbas Zaki, a prominent
Fateh leader and member of the Palestinian Legislative Council.  Speaking
in Hebron last week (before the suicidal bombing), Zaki said Hamas was no
longer the only bad guys in the sight of Israel, adding that &quot;every
patriotic Palestinian acting on his patriotism is now viewed as a terrorist
by Israel.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zaki's remarks were vindicated a day later when the &quot;&quot;&quot;Israeli
army issued a warrant to arrest Arafat's top police officer Brig. Gen. Ghazi
al Jabali on terrorism-related charges.  Needless to say, the arrest warrant
against al Jabali, who had led the crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad
last year, served as an &quot;eye-opener&quot; for many PA officials and
ordinary Palestinians, who had previously been told that &quot;Hamas was
the enemy&icirc;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zaki's views, however, do not seem to reflect &quot;Yasser
Arafat's thinking and that of his deputy, Mahmud Abbas&icirc;. Arafat reportedly
expressed willingness to &quot;resume full security and intelligence coordination&quot;
with Israel.  For his part, Abbas, whose increasingly focal obsequiousness
vis-&brvbar;-vis Israel and who has come to be viewed with growing repugnance
and simmering discontent, said the West Jerusalem suicidal bombing necessitated
the immediate resumption of the security coordination with Israel.  However,
it seems that Arafat's and Abbas's reconciliatory approach toward Israel
won't do the Palestinians any good in the long run. The reason largely stems
from the reasonably sound premise that &quot;Palestinian terrorism is not
the main factor behind Israeli intransigence, and that Israel accentuates
this factor purely for political and propagandistic reasons,&quot; a premise
the Palestinian leadership has not really understood, much less acted on.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Is it too late for peace?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most ordinary Palestinians reacted to the latest suicidal
bombing with stark ambivalence. However, this time it seems that their &quot;indignation
at Netanyahu&quot; and &quot;disenchantment with Arafat&quot; markedly outweighed
their innate reservations and objections to wanton killing.  Indeed, a sizable
majority of Palestinians seemed to squarely blame the Israeli government
for &quot;pushing Palestinians to the brink of despair.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This man (Netanyahu) is offering us either of two
choices:  surrender or terrorism,&quot; said one PA minister from the Hebron
area, adding that &quot;many more people would ultimately become potential
and actual suicide bombers if the Israeli government continued its current
policies in the West Bank.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The minister's pessimism will likely gain added significance
in light of continued mutual violence. On 4 August, an Israeli settler murdered
an elderly Palestinian shepherd outside the village of Yatta, 15 miles south
of Hebron, apparently in retaliation for the West Jerusalem bombing. Interestingly,
members of the bereaved family reportedly shouted &quot;death to the Jews&quot;
and &quot;Ayyash, Ayyash,&quot; a reference to the Hamas master bomber who
Israel says stood behind the wave of suicidal bomb attacks in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem last year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More significant, however, is the fact that an increasing
number of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims, have come to believe that it
is already late to reach an equitable, lasting settlement between Israel
and the Palestinians in light of the facts in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
 Unfortunately, this view, however gloomy it may be, is being vindicated.</FONT></P>

29th anniversary of the desecration by arson of Al Aqsa Mosque warned that
the holy mosque is still a target for the Zionist terrorists. &quot;Until
now, and despite the passing of about three decades since the deliberate
fire set at Al Aqsa, the demolition of the holy mosque is still a dream
for the terrorist Zionist sick-heads with the aim of building their false
temple on it,&quot; Hamas said, adding that the ruling issued by the Israeli
courts allowing the Zionists to perform their religious rites in Al Aqsa
yard is a step towards demolishing the mosque and Judaize the holy place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;What is happening in Al Aqsa yard and in Hebron,
where our religion is abused and our holy places are desecrated, shows the
real dimension of the struggle.  Although some Zionists are able to deceive

the others declare them impudently,&quot; Hamas said. Hamas emphasized that

are able to continue the battle and confront the Zionists.</FONT></P>

it provides to the Palestinian refugees in a bid to reduce its budgetary
deficit that is estimated at $20 million for the 1997 fiscal year.  In a
letter that UNRWA Commissioner-General Mr. Peter Hansen addressed to about
22,500 employees Agency-wide, he said he was compelled to reduce the international
staff working with UNRWA by 15%, to freeze the recruitment of 249 additional
teachers needed by the Agency schools in the new scholastic year, to cease
the Agency contribution to the university scholarships, and to freeze the
referral of refugee patients to hospitals and the hospitalization reimbursements
for November and December 1997.  Mr. Hansen added that UNRWA is considering
imposing school fees similar to those imposed by the countries that host
Palestinian refugees.  Despite these measures, Mr. Hansen said, they will
reduce the estimated budgetary deficit of 1997 by only one third. He added
that UNRWA will continue its efforts to urge the donors to increase their
contributions to the Agency.</FONT></P>

English tourist</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After initially seeking to pin the blame on Palestinians
for  the murder of an English tourist in Eilat last month, the Israeli authorities
have now admitted that Jeffrey Hunter was shot dead by a &quot;demented&quot;
Israeli holding the rank of Major in the Israeli army.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, 22 August, an Israeli police spokesman said
Daniel Okev, 45, confessed to having killed Hunter and moderately wounding
his girlfriend Charlotte Geib.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spokesman said Okev, a Major in the Israeli army, didn't
cite any motive for the crime, adding that he &quot;just did it on the spur
of the moment.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I don't know why I did it. I just pulled my gun and
shot them...maybe I need to see a psychiatrist,&quot; the murderer was quoted
as saying as he was being remanded to Be'ir al Sab'ba court Friday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Okev reportedly agreed to give the British couple a ride
from the southern Israeli town of Eilat to Beir Sheba, but as the two Britons
stopped over for five minutes to smoke and have refreshment, the driver,
Okev, pulled his pistol and fired three bullets into Hunter's head, killing
him instantly.  Okev also fired at Geib, who was injured, before fleeing
back to Eilat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, all Israeli police officials claimed that &quot;an
Arab driver from northern Israel was the chief suspect&quot; and that &quot;the
murder had nationalistic motivation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even the Israeli Minister of Tourism, Moshe Katsav, made
similar remarks while visiting Geib who was recuperating from her wounds
at an Israeli hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Katsav was quoted as telling Geib that &quot;Arab terrorism
was not only an Israeli problem and that the whole world ought to close
ranks against it.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli psychiatrists and psychologists often contend that
the Israeli army&iacute;s brutal repression of Palestinians during the intifadah
left deep psychological scars on many soldiers and field officers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Many of those soldiers have developed a trigger-happy
personality that is often coupled with a schizophrenic character whereby
they are driven to easy shooting as they used to do in the streets of the
West Bank and Gaza,&quot; said an Israeli psychiatrist from the small town
of Omer near Be&iacute;ir al Sab'ba.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Interestingly, the Israeli Defense Ministry repeatedly
deployed army psychiatrists and psychologists to aide soldiers and officers
who developed psychoses as a result of killing Arab children.<BR>
