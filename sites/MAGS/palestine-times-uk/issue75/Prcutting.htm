<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite the arrival on Saturday of the American mediator
Dennis Ross, the Israeli government has sworn to keep the remaining closures
in place until the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, arrests more than
150 activists from the Islamist group Hamas, suspected by the Israelis of
planning the suicide attack. Palestinian officials say they have arrested
some suspects but are not prepared to carry out a mass internment on Israel's
orders. Despite their present hardship, Mr. Hadah and his fellow traders
say Hamas members should not be detained without proper evidence. </FONT></P>

them when they're in prison? And why should they go to prison anyway?&quot;
asked Yusef Showamri, selling watermelons at a nearby stall.</FONT></P>

young men, clutching small rocks and tyres, walked past them toward the
checkpoint, chanting Hamas slogans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But those Palestinians bulldozed off their land will feel
differently. Mr. Arafat is being asked to take tougher measures against
Hamas in a climate where Israel holds the PA under siege, starves it of
funds which it is owed, frustrates implementation of deals on essential
infrastructural projects, and continues to pre-empt a final agreement by
creating new facts-new settlements-on the map. This is not only unrealistic
but - if he complies - bound to weaken his authority further... If there
is a slim chance of persuading Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian people to
take the risk, then the impartiality of the White House must be established
above suspicion. <B>From the editorial of The Guardian, August 12, 1997.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>AS A court sentenced two Israeli border policemen yesterday
to eight months in jail for beating and humiliating six Palestinians at
a military checkpoint, more evidence emerged of similar assaults. Tashi
Shamaya, 19, and David Ben Abu, 20, were given additional 12-month suspended
sentences. The assaults were filmed by an amateur Palestinian cameraman
last October. The videotape, showing the two policemen kicking some of the
Palestinians in the stomach and forcing others to do push-ups, was broadcast
round the world and was used as evidence in the trial. Shamaya and Ben Abu
were charged with aggravated assault and abuse of authority for their treatment
of the Palestinians, who had been caught entering Israel without permits.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli prime minister demands that Mr. Arafat crush
the extremists and deliver their leaders to Israel. The Palestinian leader
is incapable of doing that, and would be destroyed if he tried, since Mr.
Netanyahu insists that whatever Mr. Arafat does, Israel will make no substantive
political concessions and will permit no Palestinian state to exist. If
we are to believe what President Clinton and Mrs. Albright have most recently
said about the American role, Mr. Arafat's hopes are illusions. They still
insist that the Israelis and Palestinians must settle all this between them.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At the top of the list of targets in the crackdown  are
leaders of the  military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, known
as Hamas. The  militant group has claimed responsibility for several &quot;terrorist&quot;
bombings  in Israel and is widely suspected of masterminding the attack
at the  Jerusalem market. Israeli security sources said the names of prime
suspects were passed to  Palestinian security officials right after the
bombing -- names that  included Mohammed Deif, chief of operations for the
military wing of  Hamas, and his deputy, Muhi Adin Sharif. Deif is the successor
to  Mohammed Yayha Ayyash, nicknamed &quot;The Engineer&quot; for his alleged
 bomb-making prowess. Ayyash was killed 18 months ago when a  booby-trapped
cellular telephone exploded in his hand - an  assassination widely believed
to have been carried out by Israeli  agents.  <B>William Drozdiak writes,The
Washington Post, August 19, 1997.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The time provided by the Oslo formula for incremental steps
to build  confidence for a final compromise has gone by. It has not brought
any  confidence. On the contrary, there is much less confidence than five
 years ago. But that does not mean that plunging straight into ''final 
negotiations'' on the most contested issues would bring any better  results
than edging up to them has done. Judging by his recent decisions, Prime
Minister Netanyahu's plan for Palestinian self-government appears to be
a disconnected set of enclaves  on a minimum of territory which can be disrupted,
surrounded, denied any  chance of viability at the sole discretion of Israeli
authority.  <B>Flora Lewis writes, The International Herald Tribune, August
22, 1997.<BR>
