<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian National Unity Against Israeli
Atrocities</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With a cannibalistic desire to see Palestinians kill each
other, the arrogant Israeli premier Benyamin Netanyahu has been issuing
incessant demands, urging Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to
&quot;fight the terrorists and destroy their social, educational and health
infrastructure&quot; before the peace process can be resumed. For anybody
with minimal knowledge of Israeli phraseology, this is an unmistakable allusion
to orphanages, nursing homes, hospices, hospitals, kindergartens and mosques
that are run by Islamic elements.  So Benyamin Netanyahu, whose soldiers
routinely deny Palestinian women in labour access to nearby hospitals, would
like to see tens of thousands of poor Palestinians thrown into the streets.
 That is, of course, in addition to rounding up hundreds, if not thousands,
of Islamic activists who have not done anything wrong save refusing to surrender
to Netanyahu's murderous insolence and arrogance of power. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu's morbid demands suggest that the racist Israeli
leader classifies the Palestinians into two categories: collaborators, viewed
by the &igrave;superior&icirc; Jewish race as slaves and a slave can't be
a chooser; and terrorists, who ought to be mercilessly wiped out.  Hence,
every Palestinian who's political thinking is incompatible with Netanyahu's
whims of grandeur is considered a terrorist that ought to be liquidated
or at least kept behind bars for as long as it takes to mollify Netanyahu's
bloody mood.  Along the same lines, the Israeli leader seems to believe
that the legal maxim &quot;a person is innocent unless proven guilty&quot;
does not apply to Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fortunately, Mr. Arafat has not succumbed to Netanyahu's
wishes to see doom and gloom ravage the Palestinian society and eventually
weaken or destroy its collective ability to extract Palestinian rights from
Israel's criminal hands.  Arafat must have realized that the terrorism issue
is but a smokescreen used by a truly terrorist Israeli government to conceal
the repugnant reality of Israeli policies and practices in the West Bank
and East Jerusalem, including the demolition of homes, land confiscation,
ethnic cleansing and apartheid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the Palestinian leader has apparently come to
the conclusion that Netanyahu is after him personally and after his Authority,
as much as he is after Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and other nationalist Palestinian
groups opposed to Israeli occupation and domination. So, the evil design
goes, instead of Israel herself doing the genocidal task,  the Jewish state
should do it vicariously or through a proxy, e.g. by coercing Arafat and
his PA into killing and being killed by their Islamist compatriots. Then,
God forbid, Netanyahu and the rest of his gang would gleefully claim &quot;Look!
Arabs are killing Arabs.  We have nothing to do with it,&quot; the very
same remarks they uttered when Lebanese Christian militiamen butchered hundreds
of defenseless Palestinian refugees at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps
in Lebanon in September 1982.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian people must put up an effective response
to Netanyahu's savagery and evil by denying him the opportunity to see us
kill each other.  The strife is after all between Israel  (the oppressor)
and us, all of us (the oppressed), and Netanyahu and the rest of the Zionist
establishment do not distinguish between a member of Fatah and a member
of Hamas because the good Arab is &quot;the dead Arab&quot; in their book.
 We must therefore strengthen our national unity; the bedrock of our continued
survival. This can be achieved not only by dialogue forums here and there
but essentially adopting a comprehensive and cohesive strategy aimed at
delivering the Palestinian people from the cancerous shackles of the Israeli
occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, if Arafat can't undo Oslo, he shouldn't; the Palestinians
must not allow Oslo to undo Palestinian rights. A brave and responsible
stance to that effect by the Palestinian Authority would undoubtedly invite
American government consternation and indignation. But the U.S. Administration,
the premier tormentor of our people, has always connived with the Zionist
entity against our rights, which should make us un-obliged to meet her oblique
political calculations.<BR>
