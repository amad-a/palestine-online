<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Interview with Hamas Leader:</FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Khalid Mish'al: Occupation should not feel
like stability</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Following is an extensive interview with the head of
the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Mr. Khalid
Mish'al. Mr. Mish'al was commenting on the latest developments that followed
the 30 July double-suicide bombing in West Jerusalem.</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>Until the most recent
suicide bombing in West Jerusalem, the Palestinian occupied territories
had witnessed a comparative calm since the coming to power of Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu. Many observers wondered the whereabouts of Hamas and
its military wing during that period. Some had predicted that there was
an implicit agreement between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in order
to calm down the situation.</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hamas is a movement to resist
the Israeli occupation regardless of who undertakes this occupation: the
Labour party or the Likud. The enemy is one and the occupation is the occupation.
Therefore, Hamas is concerned with resisting the occupation and restoring
all Palestinian rights. As for the lengthy time period between military
operations against the occupation, it depends on the field circumstances
of the military wing, Al Qassam Brigades, which is an independent body.
This prediction could have been true before the last March bombing in Tel
Aviv, but after that and after the July double-suicide bombings, it could
not be so. The resistance is practically continuous. Hamas acts according
to Palestinian interests; this is what determines the policies of Hamas.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Under the present power imbalance, what could the
military do?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hamas reads the situation
objectively. It is aware of the power imbalance and of the superior Zionist
military against an inferior Arab military. But this should not lead to
the elimination of the Resistance option or the military action against
the occupation. Although the Resistance, under the current balance of power,
is not able to remove the occupation of Palestine and to eventually end
the struggle against the Zionist Enemy, it is necessary in the interest
of our people. The occupation should not be rewarded by giving him the virtue
of stability. This Enemy that occupies our land, desecrates our holy places
and injures our religious feelings should not be given a chance to enjoy
stability. If we are not able to defeat the Enemy today, we can make them
pay the cost of its occupation, aggression and atrocities. This is the main
objective of the heroic Resistance and Jihad; it is to exert continuous
pressure on the Enemy and to deny it any sort of stability. This continuity
and these accumulated efforts of resistance are those which drive the Enemy
backward. They are the correct means to liberate our land and extract the
legitimate rights of our people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sunday, 3 August, which was the deadline set in the communiqu&Egrave;
that adopted the Jerusalem bombing in order to achieve some demands to be
met by Israel, could be an example of the anxiety, worry and horror generated
among the Zionists. That day, about 1,000 telephone calls were recorded
of Zionists giving information about suspect persons and imagined explosives.
This is the worry and instability that the Zionist occupiers should always
feel. Why do the legitimate owners of the land have to suffer homelessness,
oppression, suppression, killings and sieges while this Enemy that occupies
their land enjoys stability?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We in Hamas perform this duty to liberate the occupied
land and restore the Palestinian rights on the one hand and to stop and
impede the Zionist plans and projects of expansionism, hegemony and domination
over the Arab and Islamic worlds on the other. Also, those who direct this
question should ask themselves what did the other options do for them? The
peace settlement was given a four-year period after the signing of the Oslo
Accords. What did it achieve? It was proven that Oslo did not achieve anything
for our people. The settlements have not stopped; the confiscation of land
continues; bypass roads are being constructed on our land; and the efforts
to Judaize and annex Jerusalem continues. The 5,000 Palestinian detainees
in the Occupation jails have not been released. Add to this the fact that
Oslo has not achieved the promised economic stability or luxury for Palestinians.
The present situation in the region made the Zionist Enemy insist on its
plans to annex the Golan Heights and to continue its atrocities in South
Lebanon. Therefore, we assert with full confidence that the only real option
is Resistance.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. But you are accused of targeting the peace settlement
not the Occupation by your bombings.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hamas' resistance of the
occupation began before the peace settlement through the popular resistance,
intifadah, and the military operations. Moreover, the peace settlement is
stalemated and lacks success and continuity. This stalemate was not caused
by Hamas' resistance but because our Zionist Enemy does not want real peace.
Even during the former Labour government, this Enemy did not honour the
Oslo agreements. As for the present leadership of the Enemy, they are not
convinced of the Oslo Accords and have their own agenda. The Enemy, therefore,
is the party that impedes the peace settlement and that does not want to
give real relinquishments. The Enemy, by its very nature, does not respect
any agreements or treaties with others. Another point is that the current
agreements are unjust for our people and therefore any settlement that is
based on oppression, aggression and honouring the hostile party will never
succeed or continue. Occupation has not come to an end, and the settlers
continue their crimes against our people and continue provoking our religious
feelings. Hence our people did not lament the stalemate peace settlement.
Hamas is trusted by our people because it is more keen to their interests
and it exerts efforts to alleviate their sufferings.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Why didn&iacute;t Hamas declare responsibility for
the 30 July bombings?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The declaration of military
operations is the responsibility of the Hamas military wing, Ezzul Deen
Al Qassam Brigades. They are the ones who decided whether or not to adopt
these operations. We, the politicians, do not intervene in such issues.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you see your relation with the Palestinian
Authority?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> We hoped that our relation
with the (Palestinian) Authority would be bilateral. In other words, the
Zionist party would not affect this relation. The Zionist Occupation is
a common enemy for all the Palestinian people. We and the Authority are
included in the Palestinian people. We have always emphasized that there
should not be any outside influencing factors that may trouble this relation.
Hamas' policy has not changed since the intifadah or after the signing of
the Oslo Accords until this moment. Although we significantly differ from
the Authority regarding the political vision and programme and although
we strongly oppose the Oslo Accords and their appendixes which strengthened
the Occupation, we have a firm stand towards the internal relation which
is to prohibit bloodshed among Palestinians and to avoid any clash with
the Authority as this would only serve the interests of the Zionist Enemy.
Our awareness of our people's rights and interests and our keenness not
to engage our people in side battles, away from their real struggle against
the Zionist Enemy, are the principles that govern the Hamas relation towards
the other Palestinian forces, including the Palestinian Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for the Authority, its stand towards Hamas was affected
by the continuous Zionist pressure under the pretext of the implementation
of the commitments stated in the Oslo Accords. This led to the appearance
of negative practices that did not serve our people. However, these practices
were not enough to satisfy the Enemy with the Authority or to make him respect
the agreements. Despite the harm that affected Hamas by the Zionist Enemy
and the Authority, Hamas remained loyal to the Palestinian interests and
emerged from the challenges stronger and more popular among the Palestinian
people.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. But lately the Authority has shown positive signs
towards Hamas.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> We have noticed after the
Jerusalem double-martyrdom bombing that the PA did not launch arrest campaigns
as was the usual practice in the past. We appreciate this stand because
we believe that there should never be arrest campaigns by the Authority
affecting any of our people. The killings, arrests and arbitrary measures
our people suffer from the Zionist Occupation are enough. Therefore, the
Authority should rush to release the detainees in its jails. We emphasize
that the Authority should not respond to pressures exerted on it by Netanyahu
and the United States Administration through its envoy Dennis Ross, both
urging the Authority to crack down on Hamas and its infrastructures. The
security coordination with the Zionist security services is also not acceptable
because it targets our people and their interests.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What we want today is to enhance the national unity and
unify our people's efforts in the face of the Enemy and its crimes and atrocities
against the Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Some PA officials say that your military operations
harmed the Palestinians and brought Netanyahu to power at which point he
suspended the peace settlement and accelerated the building of settlements.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>The present policies of
Netanyahu are not caused by the Hamas military operations. They are simply
policies to implement his platform. Hamas did not bring Netanyahu to power;
the Zionists who side with extremism and aggressive behaviour were behind
his rise to power. Netanyahu came as a natural secretion of the Zionist
Street. When Peres tried to attract the Zionist votes in the last public
election, he did not adopt moderate or peaceful policies but instead he
showed extremism by committing the Qana massacre in South Lebanon and by
suspending the redeployment of the Israeli troops in Hebron. Peres knew
that the Zionist popular taste was extremist. As for the Jewish settlement,
it was not started by Netanyahu but by the Zionist Labour governments. Settlement
policy is being agreed upon by the two main Zionist parties: the Labour
and the Likud.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Also the Zionist crimes against our people were present
even before the existence of Hamas. Those who say that times have changed
should understand that it is they who changed. The Zionist crimes and aggressions
did not change which obliges our people and their active forces to continue
their resistance and confrontation.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you see the attempts to involve Hamas in the
case of the Arab suspects who were arrested in New York on charges of planning
to attack American and Jewish targets?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The American story about
the apprehension of the three Arabs in New York was fabricated by influential
powers in the U.S. Administration that we believe to be Zionists who work
to serve the Zionist interests more than the American ones. The timing of
this claim is suspicious and the use of the name Hamas was not done innocently.
The false involvement of the name Hamas in this story aimed to attract the
world's attention away from what was happening in the occupied territories
and to deform the image of Hamas among the American people in order to give
the U.S. Administration an excuse to make Hamas a new enemy for it. This
is despite the fact, known to all, that Hamas' struggle is exclusively against
the Zionist Occupation.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Can you predict the costs that Hamas may pay because
of Washington's pressures concerning Hamas relations with European and Arab
countries?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hamas had faced various
pressures by the Zionists and the U.S. Administration. They instigated states
of the region against Hamas. But Hamas defeated all these attempts because
it reflects the conscience of Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic
nation. Hamas also enjoys high credibility among many Arab and Islamic countries.
We have good and respectable relations with these countries. Hamas is a
deep-rooted movement in the Palestinian, Arab and Islamic Street. We believe
that the U.S. Administration's interest is to refuse to be the object of
the Zionist pressures exerted on it. America has no interest in making enemies
of more than 1 billion Arabs and Muslims in the world by becoming involved
in a war against Hamas in favour of the Zionist State.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The undoing of Oslo</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, as always, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat caved in
to Israeli dictates and American blackmail, agreeing to &quot;full security
coordination&quot; with Israeli security and intelligence organs. Arafat's
latest capitulation to insolent Israeli-American dictates was as widely
expected as it was humiliating. The Chairman, it is manifestly clear to
all those who know what the Oslo Agreement is all about, is inherently powerless
to say &quot;No,&quot; not to even the most provocative and humiliating
of Israeli demands. The reason is simple: the Oslo Agreement made the very
survival of the Palestinian Authority almost wholly dependent on its inextricable
subservience to Israeli security interests. In other words, Arafat (the
pivotal figure of the PA) has no choice but to &quot;heed Israeli security
dictates&quot; willy nilly for his own and his Authority's sake. So, doing
Israel's dirty work in the occupied territories becomes in effect a &quot;paramount
Palestinian national interest,&quot; using the words of al Tayeb Abdul Rahim,
one of Arafat's numerous advisers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Doing Israel's will was relatively easy and politically
less costly during the Peres and Rabin administrations. At least both gave
Arafat something (usually trivial and insignificant in substance but big
in the Chairman's eyes), often enabling him to claim before the easy-come,
easy-go rabble that Palestinians were making gains and that those who resisted
the Israeli occupation targets, e.g. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, were actually
undermining Palestinian achievements and, therefore, deserved to be called
traitors and collaborators with the enemy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The false logic worked somewhat effectively for some time
until Benyamin Netanyahu came to power a year ago. Indeed, from the very
inception, the right-wing premier demonstrated amply his contempt for the
Oslo Accords and indicated that he would try to corrode the agreement and
eviscerate it of substance. And so he did and has been doing. The opening
of the subterranean tunnel underneath the Al Aqsa Mosque, the on-going building
of new Jewish settlements at Jabal Abu Ghneim as well as throughout the
West Bank, and the daily demolition of Arab homes, just to mention a few
things, all testify to Netanyahu's recalcitrance and arrogance of power.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With Netanyahu's insolence flying in the face of the international
community, as expressed in his frantic colonial settlement expansion drive
in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and with his gang-like government tightening
the noose around Arafat and his PA despite the latter's submission to Israeli
demands, Arafat's horizons became narrower as never before. Furthermore,
American connivance with Netanyahu, effective international apathy and Arab
paralysis seemingly largely demoralized the Palestinian leadership so much
that Arafat threatened to &quot;resume the intifadah if Netanyahu refuses
to revert to common sense.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Arafat is not going to resume the intifadah, even if
he could, for anything like that would spell the end of Oslo, and with it,
that of the Palestinian Authority, which the Chairman considers an important
national achievement that ought to be maintained at any price. Moreover,
it is highly unlikely that the PA leadership would be able to convince significant
numbers of Palestinians to take to the streets and risk being shot dead
by Israeli soldiers for illusive tactical goals centring around improving
Arafat's negotiating position. Indeed, it may be sufficiently safe to assume,
given the mounting frustration and disenchantment with the PA in the occupied
territories, that any new intifadah would be directed this time against
both the Israeli occupation authorities and the PA combined. The prospect
must be nightmarish for Arafat and may explain his reluctance to heed Israel's
incessant demands to carry out massive arrests among Islamist elements within
area &quot;A&quot;. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 16 August, Arafat told a group of carefully chosen journalists
and intellectuals that he would not budge with respect to Israeli dictates
to fight Hamas and destroy its infrastructure in the West Bank. The Chairman
was also quoted as saying that &quot;we reject the Israeli demands that
we act against our brethren and do not intend to accept dictates on this
from anyone.&quot; Surprisingly, the ostensibly defiant remarks did not
draw angry reactions from the Israeli government. According to the Jerusalem
Post, the remarks were passed off by the government as mere rhetoric and
unworthy of a formal response.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, if Arafat's threats are rhetorical, as they indeed
seem to be, what choices is he left with? Maintaining the status quo (Netanyahu's
preference), if at all possible, would perpetuate an apartheid arrangement
whereby mounting Palestinian indignation would eventually explode into a
real intifadah unlike anything the Arab-Israeli conflict has ever witnessed.
Conceivably, the eruption of violence would be on a wide scale and would
spread to neighbouring countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. On the
other hand, continuing to monkey for the Israeli organ grinder would only
vindicate the long-held views, increasingly rife among ordinary Palestinians,
that the PA is but an internationally recognized Palestinian version of
the SLA, the Israeli puppet militia in South Lebanon. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Arafat, nevertheless, does have an alternative that would
be honourable for himself and for the just Palestinian cause, provided that
he shows leadership, courage and historical responsibility. That alternative
must necessarily be the undoing of the Oslo arrangement by placing the Palestinian
issue back in its proper context. Indeed, Arafat could rightly claim that
the Oslo Agreement was meant to implement United Nations resolutions 242
and 338 which call for the Israeli pull-out from the West Bank and Gaza.
However, given Israel's adamant refusal to abide by these resolutions, and
her constant efforts to make them unrealistic by making them largely irrelevant
(given the settlements), the Palestinians, the PA Chairman could argue,
are no longer bound by a vague agreement that could only have one result:
the liquidation of the Palestinian question. An audacious feat as such on
Arafat's part would undoubtedly spell the end of the PA. But so what? An
inherently weak, inept, and corrupt Authority that is totally dependent
for its life and continued survival on the occupying power is not worthwhile
or worth maintaining. It is therefore better, much better, for the Palestinians
and their enduring, just cause to reappear before themselves and before
the world as they really are, a colonized and tormented people aspiring
for freedom and deliverance from the shackles of Zionist occupation and
domination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Would Arafat be courageous enough to do it? It is hard
to say, and many would not give him the benefit of the doubt. But if he
didn't, and soon (because time is running out for a just and durable settlement
in light of the demographic changes in the West Bank), he would only go
down in history as the Palestinian leader who saw over the liquidation of
his people's cause.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Clinton's Health Improves While Palestinian
Health Declines</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Robert W. McGee*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The occupying Israeli government continues its ethnic cleansing
policy in Palestine while President Clinton takes his daily jogs for exercise.
A recent New York Times photo of President Clinton and his daughter Chelsea
shows them jogging while on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. The two and a
half mile jog was the longest since his knee operation. The T-shirt he was
wearing said &quot;I Met Yoni Dotan.&quot; Dotan is the son of an Israeli
entertainer. The shirt was given to him in connection with the Make a Wish
Foundation, a group that grants wishes to severely ill children. Chelsea's
T-shirt had the inscription &quot;Live Free or Die,&quot; a popular phrase
during the American Revolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While Clinton jogged to improve his health, the health
of the Palestinians in the occupied territories was growing worse with each
passing day. The occupying Israeli forces continue their systematic policy
of preventing Palestinians from entering hospitals for treatment, going
to work or to the market to buy needed food and medical supplies. They continue
to demolish Palestinian homes, leaving dozens of Palestinian families homeless.
They bulldoze roads, making it difficult or impossible for Palestinians
to travel or transport goods. They turn away tourist buses, preventing them
from entering Bethlehem during the peak of the tourist season, thus further
weakening the Palestinian economy. Vegetables are rotting in the fields
and new crops cannot be planted because farmers are prevented from getting
to their fields. The fragile Palestinian economy is losing $6 million a
day during the siege, according to some estimates, and Palestinians face
hunger if the siege continues.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zahya Harb, a 19 year-old pregnant Bedouin woman was denied
permission to pass through the checkpoint in Beitunia, a village near Ramallah
located 1.5 kilometers from the hospital. After waiting two hours, she was
forced to give birth in a car. Sleiman Alhamouz was brutally beaten while
on his way to a hospital in Hebron. Twelve year-old Raed Faris was severely
beaten by soldiers as he was walking on his family's property. Israeli soldiers
randomly selected a large number of men and children from the village of
Azawiya and severely beat them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The occupying forces have placed a number of restrictions
on the movement of medical personnel and their mobile medical clinics. Mobile
clinics and physicians have been denied passage into or through several
cities and villages, including Tulkarem and Nablus. They could not pass
through the checkpoint at Beitunia to reach villages in Northern Jerusalem.
They could not leave Beit Sahour to go to near-by villages. There has been
a 50 percent decrease in employee attendance at Al-Makassad Hospital in
Jerusalem because employees were prevented from getting to work. St. John's
Hospital in Jerusalem has seen a 60 percent decline in services. In the
Red Crescent Hospital in Jerusalem, half the physicians and nurses have
not been able to reach the hospital for at least two weeks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian patients have been systematically forced to
leave hospitals before finishing their treatments. Randa Hassouna was kicked
out of intensive care at Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital after suffering head
trauma and a concussion following a car accident. Issa Al Makhamra was expelled
even though she had a severe spinal infection. In fact, the hospital expelled
all Palestinian patients after the bombings in West Jerusalem. Such collective
punishment tactics are reminiscent of the nazis during the 1940s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli settlers, with the backing of the occupying Israeli
military, have stepped up their attacks on Palestinians. Palestinians have
been randomly shot at as they try to go to work or transfer the wounded
to nearby hospitals. Soldiers have invaded more than 40 villages to spread
terror among the residents. Even Palestinians who have permits have been
refused entry into Jerusalem or Israel (occupied Palestine). About 33,000
students and 15,000 teachers have been denied access to schools and universities.
But the real question is why Palestinians should need permits to travel
about in their own country? Palestinians have fewer rights than the Jews
had under the nazis. Yet the Clinton administration, like so many administrations
before him, continue to support such human rights abuses by giving the occupying
Israeli government billions of dollars in foreign aid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I have a suggestion for President Clinton's next vacation.
Why not spend a few weeks in the West Bank or Gaza to see how the &quot;other
half&quot; lives under Israeli occupation? A few T-shirt suggestions --
how about &quot;I Met Zahya Harb&quot; or &quot;Stop the Ethnic Cleansing&quot;
or Cut off Aid to Israel&quot;? And for Chelsea, how about &quot;Palestine
for the Palestinians,&quot; printed in Arabic, Hebrew and English? For gift
suggestions -- why not give &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; T-shirts to members
of the U.S. Embassy staff. Maybe that will give them a different perspective
on the &quot;peace&quot; process.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Another American Perception of Israeli Occupation</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By David McLau*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinians are justified to strike back against their
Israeli occupiers by any means necessary, including what we saw last month.
We should remember that they do not have modern weapons. They fight with
what they have. We should not deny them the right to self-defence while
their homeland is being forcefully taken from them. There are some people
who condemn the violence. But, the right of self-defence is just as basic
as the right to live free from violence. In fact, that is why we supposedly
have the Fourth Geneva Accords, to provide a means of avoiding the violence
of ethnic cleansing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Fourth Geneva Accords suposedly prevents exactly the
kind of colonization that Israel has done to Palestine. But , the Palestinians
do not have the benefit of that law that the rest of us have , because of
the veto of the United States in the United Nations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Accords clearly state that it is impermissible to acquire
land by means of force which Israel did in 1967 and also 1948. Furthermore,
it states that it is illegal to remove the indigenous population and colonize
any territory with one's own population. Are we going to live by the law?
Remember, there was a time when we had no laws and the Jews paid a terrible
price. Now we have laws, and it is the Jews who do not want to abide by
them! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The United States has used its veto power in the United
Nations to prevent the world body from stopping the continuous land confiscation
and ethnic cleansing in the Occupied Territories, time and again, over the
past 30 years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinians now have no other legal recourse but to
resort to violence, and it will be in self-defence. Their violence will
be justified both by history and by international law since they are defending
their homeland from this illegal occupation and ethnic cleansing. It is
exactly the way the French and Russian resistance movements fought their
occupiers during the Second World War. Some may argue that the French resistance
movement never killed German civilians during their struggle. However, one
must remember that Germany never tried to colonize France with its civilians
during that war the way that Palestine has now been colonized by the Israelis.
And it is for that reason that civilian casualties in France were fewer
as a result. One must only remember the intentional fire bombing of Dresden
by the allies at the end of the War when it was common knowledge that the
city was full of refugees, of which 200,000 died as a result of that firestorm,
to see that war and self-defence can, at times, be very cruel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I have come to the above-stated conclusion with regard
to the Palestinians&iacute; right to self-defence only after becoming well
informed as to the daily confiscation of land, demolition of houses, torture
of civilians, collective punishments, detentions and so on suffered by Palestinians.
I see no other alternative for them.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians defend their Aqsa Mosque</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>East Jerusalem- Nearly everyday for the past several weeks,
Israeli police have detained Jewish fanatics trying to enter Al-Haram Al-Sherif
to pray. Located just above the Wailing Wall, the most sacred site for Jews,
Al-Haram includes Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the
striking Dome of the Rock, which covers the location where Mohammed ascended
to heaven. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To most outside observers, these acts of religious provocation
against Palestinian Moslems are easily dismissed as lunatic behavior of
a few mentally unstable zealots. A closer look, however, suggests a deeper
trend in the religious nationalist Zionists movement that seeks to eventually
take control of Al-Haram for the purpose of rebuilding the Third Jewish
Temple. &quot;Many rabbis and religious people in Israel hold that the messiah
cannot come until the temple is rebuilt,&quot; explains Yaariv Ehud, an
orthodox resident of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. &quot;The temple can
only be rebuilt where it once stood, which is where the Moslems now have
their mosque.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Threats to al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock began when
Israel captured the Old City in 1967. A debate began then among government
and religious leaders concerning the issue of a new temple. Though the Labor
Government was then careful not to openly threaten any of the Arab churches
or mosques in Jerusalem, others in Israel began acts of provocation that
greatly increased tension in Palestine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1969, an Australian tourist set Al-Aqsa ablaze. Israeli
authorities denounced the act of arson and deported him back home, but for
Moslems, who slowly heard talk of rebuilding a Jewish temple on the Temple
Mount, suspicions grew. Israeli authorities began excavation activities
around the outside walls of Al-Aqsa in the early 1970s, seeking the City
of David, which was the King David's capital in Palestine thousands of years
ago. Al-Aqsa and the Al-Haram compound started to suffer structural damage
as a result of the diggings and Palestinians began to complain to the Israelis,
who slowed down, but did not stop, their efforts to find past archeological
glory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1977 a new Likud government under former Argon terrorist
Menachem Begin was elected in Israel. He formed a right-wing government
that was ideologically devoted to the settlement of &quot;Eretz&quot; or
greater Israel. Groups that were formerly on the fringe of Israeli politics
had now one of their own in power and took the chance to further their efforts
to undermine Arab control over places they sought for their own. The West
Bank saw an explosion in religious settlements, as opposed to the &quot;security&quot;
type that Labor created. Begin spoke of a &quot;Divine duty&quot; to settle
&quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; (the West Bank) and found no shortage of willing
citizens, spurred on by tax breaks and economic incentives to live on land
taken by force from local Palestinians.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was an alarming increase in provocative acts by young
yeshiva students trying to enter Al-haram to pray. In 1978, bombs were found
near Al-Aqsa in the possession of such groups. There were many violent confrontations
between them and the Waqf guards, who prevented extremist Israelis from
entering Al-haram to pray. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A settler underground was formed in 1980 to employ terror
and violence against innocent Arabs in the West Bank. Composed mostly of
settlers around Hebron and Nablus, the underground called itself &quot;Terror
Against Terror&quot; or TNT in Hebrew. Explosive they were. In addition
to putting bombs in the cars of three West Bank mayors, planting bombs in
crowded stadiums and markets in Hebron, injuring dozens of people, and carrying
out a machine gun attack on Hebron University, which left three students
dead and 40 more injured, the underground also looked to the Moslem shrines
in Jerusalem as a target of their zeal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1984, a cell broke off of the TNT mainstream group because
they felt that the other Jewish terrorists were neglecting their duty to
destroy Al-Aqsa for the sake of a new temple. This cell was called the Lifta
Group, named after the empty Palestinian village in West Jerusalem that
was attacked by Israeli troops in 1948 and where the terrorists hid their
weapons for the attack. Fortunately, Waqf guards saw three men climbing
down into Al-haram one foggy morning and alerted Israeli police, who arrested
them. The men were armed with assault rifles, a dozen hand grenades and
other explosives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The other members of TNT hesitated in their actual attack
of Al-Aqsa, waiting to get official religious approval for their attack
on the shrines. Leading rabbis in Israel have always called for the right
of Jews to pray on &quot;the Temple Mount&quot; but have come short in calling
for the elimination of the Islamic presence there. By the time that TNT
was ready to carry out the attack, the Israeli intelligence had penetrated
the group. Over 40 settlers were arrested, including army officers with
access to heavy weapons. Despite murdering and maiming many innocent Arabs,
all members of TNT have since been released from prison. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Intifada years saw more mainstream Israeli groups established
to address the issue of rebuilding the Temple on Al-Haram. Gershon Solomon,
a Jerusalem politician, is the leader of &quot;The Temple Mount Faithful.&quot;
The regularly lead marches to the gates of Al-haram calling for the rebuilding
of the temple there. It is this group's effort to lay a cornerstone near
al-Aqsa in 1990 that sparked the massacre of 19 Palestinian civilians in
al-Haram. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While the Israeli government claims to endorse a tolerance
for all faiths in Jerusalem, the Israeli courts continue to grant prayer
rights to extremists like Yehuda Etzion, a former TNT leader, who now heads
a group called Hai Vakayoom. Their main aim is to regain the Temple Mount
for Isreal and the Jews. &quot;I will not rest until the Temple Mount is
restored to its rightful owners, the Jews,&quot; Etzion recently told a
group of journalists in Jerusalem. &quot;Let the Moslems take the mosque
to Saudi Arabia and pray there.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jebal Abu-Ghneim settlement, the new effort to build
Jewish housing at Ras Al-Amud, the opening of a tunnel near al-Aqsa and
the confiscation of thousands of Jerusalem ID cards all suggests a pattern
of Israeli behavior in Arab Jerusalem that leads to further confrontation
and violence. There is no greater risk of large-scale bloodshed in the Holy
Land, however, than the threat to Al-haram. &quot;We will give every drop
of our blood to protect our mosques,&quot; says Ahmed Ibrahim in Ramallah.
&quot;The youth of Palestine have died in the past protecting our sacred
Al-Aqsa and we will do so again and again until the enemies of Islam know
that we will not be destroyed.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Are rabbis serious about dialogue with Muslim</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>religious leaders?</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the 30 July suicidal bombing in West Jerusalem,
some Jewish religious leaders renewed earlier calls for a Jewish-Muslim
dialogue to discuss particular issues, especially, the relatively new phenomenon
(in Islam but not in Judaism) of suicidal bombings or &quot;martyrdom operations&quot;
as often labelled by many Muslims. The latest call made earlier this month
by Israel's Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau was not the first of its kind.
On 29 January 1995, a week after the Beit Lid bombing, Lau made a similar
appeal in which he criticized Muslim religious leaders for not condemning
suicidal bombings by Palestinians against Jews. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lau's calls, it is noted, were all made in the aftermath
of suicidal bombings in which Israelis lost their lives. However, no such
calls were ever made after similar, even far more deadly atrocities were
committed against Muslim civilians by Israeli settlers (e.g. the Ibrahimi
Mosque Massacre on 25 February 1994) or by recurrent IDF action (e.g. the
Qana carnage on 18 April 1996). In fact, in the first example, some rabbis
from Gush Emunim openly eulogized the murderer, Baruch Goldstein, as &quot;a
great saint and hero,&quot; and actually made his tomb in Kiryat Arba, on
the outskirts of Hebron, a pilgrimage site. Others (including some Knesset
members) gleefully celebrated the slaughter in the spirit of the Jewish
holiday called the Purim. In the second example (the Qana massacre), which
was perpetrated premeditatedly as ascertained by the United Nations, Israeli
political and religious leaders alike adamantly refused to say &quot;sorry&quot;
for the killing of over 100 defenseless Lebanese men, women and children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even today we are still affronted by the deafening silence
of rabbis in the face of escalating Israeli brutalities against defenseless
Palestinians such as the demolition of Palestinian homes, the flagrant seizure
of their land and the ongoing ethnic cleansing in East Jerusalem. The examples
are actually so numerous that it is sufficiently safe to argue that the
bulk of Jewish religious leaders in Israel and abroad have been almost totally
insensitive to the enduring plight of the Palestinian people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, dialogue between the adherents of Islam and
Judaism should essentially be a positive matter that ought to be pursued
with good will and a great deal of wisdom on both sides. More to the point,
dialogue is not only good and desirable in the religious sense, but politically
vital in today's global village. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Jewish-Muslim dialogue would not need to start from scratch
as the adherents of the two monotheistic religions have a long common history
of coexistence, interaction and even cooperation. Indeed, if one examines
thoroughly the spirit of the shariah, he will discover for himself that
the Qur&iacute;an, contrary to common belief, is neither anti-Judaic nor
anti-Jewish. Indeed, the very religion of Islam can be considered, in a
certain sense, a continuation of the spiritual and moral heritage of the
Israelite prophets. Jews and Christians are accorded in Islam the favourable
title &quot;the People of the Book,&quot; granting them religious legitimacy
and societal equality before the law in Islam. The Qur&iacute;an states
that &quot;Those who believe (Muslims) and those who follow the Jewish scriptures,
and the Christians, and the Sabians, and who believe in God and the Last
Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; On
them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.&quot; ( Sura II, verse 62).
Good, God-fearing Jews (and Christians) are, therefore, commended&oacute;not
condemned&oacute;in Islam.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The crux of the matter</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are few Muslims today, as far as I know, who believe
that a Jewish-Muslim dialogue would be worthwhile, much less meaningful,
if it did not have the Palestine issue on the top of its agenda. The enduring
plight of the predominantly Muslim Palestinian people at the hands of Zionist
Jews, after all, is, by and large, the essence of contemporary animosity
between Jews and Muslims. Hence, without &quot;wiping the slate clean&quot;
in this regard, any and every dialogue would be doomed to sure failure.
For example, no Muslim religious leader worthy of the name would agree to
discuss symptomatic subjects such as &quot;suicidal bombings and the sanctity
of human life&quot; aside from the sinister Israeli policies and practices
towards the Palestinian people. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is not to say that Muslim religious leaders would
expect their Jewish counterparts to succeed in rectifying or indemnifying
the countless wrongs and historical injustices that have been inflicted
(and continue to be inflicted) on Palestinians by Zionist Jews. Rabbis,
like sheikhs, are not all-powerful, after all, and their words have mainly
moral, rather than political, influence. But moral influence is, in the
final analysis, what the dialogue is all about. Moral influence can be effective,
even more effective than political action, in educating the public to be
more sensitive to wrongs inflicted by Jews against Muslims or vice versa.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But if &quot;rectification and indemnification&quot; of
legitimate Palestinian grievances are not to be viewed as prerequisites
for a credible dialogue, recognition by the rabbis of these grievances,
past and present, should be axiomatic, otherwise there would be no point
in starting a dialogue in the first place. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is not an impossible precondition to meet, nor a problematic
issue fraught with religious controversy. The Palestinian plight, as was
the Jewish plight in Europe in the 1940s, manifestly embodies the evil and
brutality of man against his fellow man, thus representing the antithesis
of all religious tenets and ideals, Muslim and Jewish. In short, the slate
would have to be wiped clean in this regard because Muslims would not accept
any less from Jewish leaders than that which they (the Jews) demanded and
got from Christian leaders. In other words, the rabbis would have to show
moral courage in recognizing the injustices mete out to the Palestinians
by Jews just as Christian leaders (and the Vatican) did in recognizing the
historical injustices which Jews suffered at Christian hands. Such a recognition
would undoubtedly set the stage for a new peaceful, stable and durable relation
between Muslims and Jews. It would also, and this is the crux of the matter,
exert moral pressure on the collective Israeli conscience to reconsider
its traditional hostile attitudes toward the Palestinian people as a prelude
towards the restoration of Palestinian rights.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1978, an American Christian fundamentalist, using simple
logic, illustrated the Muslim position regarding dialogue with Jews. Writing
in the religious American journal &quot;Christianity Today,&quot; Elizabeth
Elliot made the following analogy:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&igrave;Suppose, an old Arab said to me when I was visiting
Jerusalem, just suppose you have eight little chickens. You have watched
them hatch; you feed and care for them; they are your pets. One night a
neighbour comes and cleans you out. He takes all eight of your baby chicks.
Next morning he reaches his hand toward you across the fence. Will you shake
hands? No, you cannot. Even if I have lost only little chickens, it will
be hard to give my neighbour my hand. But what if I have lost my land, my
olive groves, my orchards, my vineyards, my house, my job, my money? Yet,
the world says 'why are the Arabs so stubborn?' Israel offers them the hand
of peace, but they will not reach across the table.&icirc;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In short, the Jews would have to return the stolen goods
to the rightful owner. This is not a prerequisite for the start of dialogue;
however, it is central to its success.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Long-Awaited Operation</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Azzam Tamimi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I was driving my in-law's pick-up truck through Madaba,
a city about 35 kilometres to the south of Amman, when my son, who rode
in the back, shouted &quot;Father, there's been a bombing in Israel.&quot;
Shouting loudly to defeat the noise, he explained that people in restaurants
and shops were watching Israel TV which was carrying live coverage of what
seemed to him from a distance to be a suicide bombing. As I stopped by a
shop to buy some vegetables, I could clearly see what he meant. The shop
owner was more attentive to the TV broadcast than to me. Ambulance sirens
intermingled with the shouts of eyewitnesses who described with horror what
had happened. As if watching a football match, onlookers outside the shop
almost cheered. Smiles were on their faces and relief was in their eyes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Such feelings were not without good reason. On the eve
of the August double-suicide bombing in Jerusalem, little doubt about the
failure of the peace process was left in the minds of many previously hopeful
Arabs in both Palestine and Jordan. Many blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu for the stalemate and for the escalation of tension in the West
Bank and particularly in the city of Hebron. Desperate and at the same time
deeply distressed West Bank and Gazan citizens, including some of those
directly involved with the Palestinian Authority (PA), had been asking:
&quot;Where has Hamas gone?&quot; In Jordan, too, people had been wondering
why the horrific suicide operations had ceased?&quot; If only Hamas were
to act again,&quot; an Amman-based middle-aged man from Hebron shouted as
he discussed with fellow Hebronites the future of the city after weeks of
unrest. The position of the PA had grown increasingly embarrassing. Its
president, Yasser Arafat, and his senior aides had clearly been reduced
to mere security agents working for the peace partner Israel. A traditionally
staunch supporter of the PA, whose son-in-law is a senior PA official, told
me he was becoming increasingly convinced that it's been all over nothing.
&quot;The Israelis want everything and are willing to give nothing in return.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA may not have had anything to do with the bombings,
but they seemed to serve their interests well. Now, after many months of
disregard, everyone wants to talk to Arafat including Netanyahu who, despite
the rhetoric, is in dire need of his cooperation. Soon after the bombings,
and although Hamas had not claimed responsibility for the carnage, a Jordanian
columnist wrote: &quot;Hamas speaks for the people.&quot; Notwithstanding
the fact that the PA stands to benefit from the bombing, it is compelled
to prove to the Israelis not only that none of its own people is embroiled
in the planning or execution of the operations but also that it is as anxious
as the Israelis to identify the culprits and catch the perpetrators. However,
unexpectedly this time there has been no claim of responsibility for the
bombings. Scores of Hamas and Islamic Jihad supporters were briefly detained
but then released. The PA had no option but to divert the attention of the
Israelis elsewhere. It was claimed that the two suicide bombers must have
come from abroad. London, Lebanon and Cairo were all suggested at one time
or another. Palestinian establishments in the United Kingdom were once more
focused on. The British authorities, just like the Egyptian and the Lebanese,
denied the allegations. In the meantime, the identities and political affiliation
of the perpetrators remain a mystery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is ironic that less than 24 hours before the bombings
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu boasted about security during his era.
Israeli security authorities were never as confident, and everyone thought
that such attacks were history. The disappointment prompted the U.S. Administration
to intervene in order to salvage the peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But what, and how much, can the Americans do to prevent
such occurrences? The Ramallah meetings in the aftermath of the bombings
between Israeli and Palestinian intelligence officers in the presence of
CIA senior officials are said to have been aimed at reviewing security measures.
But what additional measures are likely to work? Neither the Israelis nor
the Americans are willing to concede that they face an impossible mission
in the Middle East. They have so far failed to understand what really motivates
a young man to take his own life and those of scores of others. It is highly
unlikely that they will soon appreciate that millions of Muslims around
the world are only too willing to do exactly what the two bombers did. By
occupying Palestine, desecrating its shrines and oppressing its people,
the Israelis hardly receive any sympathy from Muslims. The recent insults
dealt to Prophet Mohammed and the Virgin Mary have exacerbated, and even
added urgency to, the desire for revenge. Still thinking that collective
punishment will deter prospective bombers, Israel only helps create many
more such human missiles. Oppressive and corrupt Palestinian authority and
dire economic conditions only add salt to the Palestinian wound; rather
than convince Palestinian youngsters of minding their own business and accepting
life as offered to them by their occupiers and their collaborators, they
create a more favourable environment for suicide.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>That All The Zionist Murderers Are Psychopaths</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Mohammad Jalal-Abadi*</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zionist oligarchy's lame excuse and idiosyncrasy that every
Uzi-toting Zionist terrorist is a psychopath can no longer be accepted by
a civilized world. The Zionist murderers who machine-gunned the Muslims
in Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron, the hired Australian Zionist who set fire
in Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the Uzi-toting, laughing &euml;settlers&iacute;
who murdered the deaf and dumb Muslim Palestinian teenage boy, the Zionist
colonialist soldiers who murdered the 6-year-old Muslim Palestinian girl,
the three skull-cap-wearing American fanatic Zionist terrorists who murdered
a pregnant Muslim Palestinian woman, the uncivilized Zionist conscripts
who broke the bones of Muslim Palestinian boys with stone (and admitted
that they committed such a barbaric crime because they were ordered by none
other than the assassinated Rabin to do so), the &euml;driver&iacute; settlers
who shot dead the innocent Muslim Palestinian men who were returning home
from work, the prostitute who depicted Islam's holy prophet, peace be upon
him, in a most degrading cartoon as well as hundreds of thousands of other
murders are criminal terrorists and must be treated as such. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>News that &igrave;a Tel Aviv military court found that
a Zionist soldier, Noam Friedman (a dual national citizen of both America
and Israel), was psychopathic when he fired 15 rounds towards Palestinian
shoppers in Hebron last January and will not stand any trial but rather
would get medical treatment or go to a religious school&icirc; demonstrated
clearly to all concerned that not only the soldiers and settlers but the
whole lot of the Zionist terrorists are psychopaths. How long will a civilized
world tolerate such Zionist terrorists? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For those who might be inclined to hope for more balance
in future U.S. administrations, especially if a Republican candidate takes
office, their hopes will be gravely disappointed. Muslims would be much
better off to face the reality now and begin their contingency planning,
to work toward change in their region despite the U.S. alliance with Israel.
For it is only by effecting regional change that the U.S. will find an incentive
to change its general approach to the area, that is, it will do so only
when it finds there is no other choice, because realities on the ground
compel it to stop taking Arab-Muslim support for granted. Currently there
is no incentive to do anything except increase support for Israel, because
the region is basically perceived as being under control. That has allowed
support for Israel to become a kind of blind support unrelated to what Israel
does locally or regionally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leading presidential contenders the next time around
the Republican centrist Jack Kemp and his Democratic equivalent, the current
U.S. Vice President Al Gore are as devoted to Israel as Clinton, if not
even more so. They can be expected to compete with each other in the next
presidential election to demonstrate which one of them is more pro-Israel.
The Republican neo-conservatives, Kemp among them in contrast to the paleo-conservatives
such as Pat Buchanan are fanatically devoted to Israel and even tend toward
the Israeli hard-right. They are close friends with the current Israeli
prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel's legislative achievements in
the United States, now deeply entrenched, continue to take attention away
from the more dynamic process now underway: the consolidation of a high
level of Israeli influence at the top of the executive branch and now, in
the leadership of both political parties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To understand the importance of an already powerful Israeli
lobby, and one that has now entered a new phase of vertical expansion since
the end of the Cold war, is to recognize that the most powerful influence
apparatus in this country is not concerned with automobiles or unions or
tobacco but rather with the well being of a foreign country, one that has
for some time been at odds with its neighbors, as well as with the indigenous
population, which it has displaced and whose land it has occupied. This
foreign country has expelled the vast majority of the indigenous population
by force and ruthlessly oppressed its small remnant, namely, which is the
historic iniquity that has been committed by the Israeli state against the
now six-million strong Arab Palestinian, mostly Muslim, people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite Israel's lack of democracy, so far as it relates
to Palestinians, and the instability that always surrounds it, Israel's
supporters have enabled it to influence the United States, and through it,
the entire world community, especially in the post-Cold war era. This era
has seen the total and complete bypassing and negation of international
law, and a total disregard for the literally volumes of United Nations resolutions
that have been passed by the Security Council and General Assembly alike,
deploring Israel's grand-strategic practices toward the Palestinians and
other Arab and Muslim peoples.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Practices such as expelling Palestinians from their own
country and preventing their return; invading and occupying the territories
of other Arab states; moving large segments of its civilian population into
the occupied areas; appropriating the holy city of East Jerusalem, as well
as several West Bank cities on its periphery, prohibiting access to the
entire area by Palestinian Muslims in the West Bank and Gaza, and, in their
own words, Judaizing it, thereby liquidating its indigenous character; and
systematically imprisoning, torturing, or indiscriminately bombing all those
who resist these practices have all been condemned over and over again in
United Nations fora.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yet it is all swept aside in the international community's
current policy toward the region, due to the unfailing efforts of an American
superpower, conditioned by pro-Israeli forces active within the United States
to deflect all criticism and/or sanction that the world would ordinarily
have leveled against Israel. As if this were not enough, the United States
has also been used as an instrument in Israel's efforts to re-write the
history of the Middle East conflict, in effect deleting U.N. resolutions
such as the historic Zionism is racism resolution of 1975, which it does
not like, as if to toss a scrap of history down the memory hole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The U.S. role in playing interference for Israel, in effect
shielding it from any and all accountability to the international community
at large, as well as to the peoples who have been its victims, has allowed
it to continue with its own program undeterred. This leaves Israel unscathed
by an international community that would have, in other circumstances, used
its influence, its standing, and its leverage to constrain Israeli excesses
and to insist on at least a modicum of decency in its behavior. The United
Nations, once held out as the greatest hope for world peace, has been reduced
to little more than an international enforcement arm for the various uses
of force decided upon in Washington (and Tel Aviv) and deployed against
small countries like Iraq, Iran, Libya and Sudan. The United Nations organization
has become a useful tool for building up international coalitions against
real and imagined enemies and threats, but is no longer dedicated to the
impartial upholding of its own laws and principles. Such distortion of an
institution founded to preserve mutual peace and goodwill among nations
is bound to create exactly the opposite result.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most observers agree that Israel and many of the countries
at odds with it are strategically located. Yet, while a stable atmosphere
of goodwill between these countries and America benefits the U.S. national
interest, attempts to insert the Israeli national interest into the forefront
of the United States foreign policy agenda undermine what are otherwise
the main policy objectives of the United States. This leads to a widespread
perception among the peoples in the Muslim world that the United States
is behaving in a cynical and hypocritical way toward them, due to the prevalence
of the double standard in all its relations with them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A recent and very instructive example is in a little-known
clause of the foreign operations appropriations bill for 1997 (H.R. 3540),
currently making its way through Congress. This bill conditions American
assistance for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the international
agency responsible for monitoring and verifying the nuclear operations of
more than 180 countries in the world, as well as exchanges of materials
that can be used for the construction of nuclear weapons, on whether Israel
is allowed to participate in the activities of that agency. This right includes
not only the ability to participate in IAEA formal meetings but also to
receive nuclear technical assistance. While Israel receives the full benefits
of being a member of the IAEA, it continues to refuse to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and hence to subject itself to comprehensive
IAEA safeguards. Egypt, which is seeking Israeli compliance with IAEA standards,
is subjected to intolerable political and economic pressure by the United
States to stop insisting that Israel comply with the same strictures as
every other country in the world. The implicit penalty is that Egypt's economic
aid from the United States, on which the country's leadership has unfortunately
allowed itself to become dependent, would be cut off.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How is such a contradiction possible? How is it that such
a course of action could appear rational to United States policymakers?
It is possible because the Israeli lobby has succeeded in convincing the
United States that it, as a nation, must be considered an exception to every
rule, that it be allowed to dwell alone in a unique and revered solitary
realm above the rule of law that applies to everyone else. Indeed, through
the years Israel has established itself in the minds of United States policymakers,
and many other American elites as well, as a somehow unique country with
special requirements hence the special relationship between the United States
and Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unquestionably, there are many factors that contribute
to Israel's grip on United States foreign policy priorities, especially
as they affect the vast populations of the Middle East and the Muslim world
at large. Of particular interest to us is how the pro-Israeli forces exerting
their vast influence inside the United States have negatively affected the
American stance toward the Islamic revival, how they have created an atmosphere
of </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>hostility and confrontation where none need ever have existed.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Mujaydil Before 1948</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village stood on the gently-sloping, southern slopes
of Wadi al-Mujaydil, on the Nazareth-Haifa highway. In 1596, al-Mujaydil
was in the nahtya of Tabariyya (ltwa' of Safad) with a population of twenty-two.
It paid taxes on wheat, barley, fruit trees, goats, and beehives. [Hut.
and Abd.:1871 In the late nineteenth century al-Mujaydil was described as
a &quot;flourishing&quot; village built of stone and mud. It was on the
northern side of a small plateau, and olive groves were cultivated to the
east and south. The number of its residents was estimated at 800 (in 1859);
they cultivated 100 faddans (1 faddan = 100-250 dunums; see Glossary). [SWP
(1881) 1:275] Several springs flowed in the vicinity of the village, mainly
in the southwest. Al-Mujaydil had a triangular outline; its houses were
clustered closely together, and were made of stone and mud, stone and cement,
or concrete. In 1945 it was the third largest village in the district in
terms of population; it had 1,640 Muslims and 260 Christian inhabitants.
There were two elementary schools in al-Mujaydil, one for boys and one for
girls. The village also had a Roman Catholic church and a monastery, and
a local council that administered its affairs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Survey of Palestine [(1946)1:139] estimates the council's
expenditures at 36 Palestinian pounds (Pi) in 1929 but offers no figures
for subsequent years. The Palestine Gazette [no. 1630, cited in D 7/2:138]
shows that these expenditures amounted to 80 Palestinian pounds in 1937
and then fell to 34 Palestinian pounds in 1942, although the revenues continued
to grow. Agriculture was the backbone of the economy; the most important
crop was grain. In 1944/45 a total of 14,982 dunums was allotted to cereals;
1,685 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, the bulk of which (1,600
dunums) was planted with olive trees. Al-Mujaydil was the second largest
olive producer in the district and had two mechanical olive presses in operation.
Traces of a Roman road were found close to the village, which may indicate
that the region was opened to intensive settlement as early as Roman times.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Like neighboring Ma'lul, al-Mujaydil was occupied by a
unit of the Golani Brigade, according to the History of the Haganah. That
occurred on 14 or 15 July 1948, during the second stage of Operation Dekel
(see 'Amqa, Acre District), as the Israeli army closed in on Nazareth. The
attack on this village misled the defenders of Nazareth into believing that
the city would be attacked from the south. The History of the Haganah states:
&quot;It seems that the Arabs of Nazareth were confident of their ability
to repulse any attack from that direction [i.e. the south],&quot; but it
goes on to describe how the assault on Nazareth proceeded from the northwest,
by Israeli units concentrated in the previously occupied town of Shafa 'Amr.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Mujaydil was one of the villages in Lower Galilee that
was completely emptied of its inhabitants and then razed to the ground.
[M:xv, 199-200; T:249] About 1,200 refugees from al-Mujaydil had reportedly
reached Nazareth by the end of July 1948, but it is not clear whether they
remained there. [M:343, n.6]</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Settlements on Village Lands</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jewish immigrants from Iran established the settlement
of Migdal ha-'Emeq (172231) in 1952 on village land, less than 1 km southwest
of the village site. The older settlement of Yif'at (171231), established
in 1926 on what were traditionally village lands, is 2 km west of the site.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Village Today</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Most of the site is covered with a pine forest that serves
as an Israeli park. The monastery and parts of the (destroyed) church are
the only remaining buildings on the site; monks still live in the monastery
(see photos). Remnants of destroyed houses and the walls of a cemetery are
visible. Cactuses and pomegranate, olive, and fig trees grow around the
site, which is dotted with wells.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arab Pride And Cultural Imperialism</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What has happened to Arab pride? Has it flown away at the
sight of cultural imperialism? For decades there has been a decline in the
respect Arabs show for their own culture. Many behave as if they are ashamed
to speak Arabic and to be Arab. They love Americans and Europeans. However,
the American culture is the final victor for their hearts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How did this happen? How can a people begin to lose themselves?
The Arab culture is ancient and it has much to offer the world as well as
many intelligent scholars and artists. However, their culture was interrupted
by foreign colonialists. The British, French and Italians were prominent,
but now the United States&iacute; presence is the most influential. These
countries left the region, but their mark has remained, thus causing a new
phenomena to spring forth cultural imperialism. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How is this possible? Let us call to mind a quote from
the film The Last of the Mohicans: &igrave;I thought it was British policy
to make the whole world England.&icirc; In the whole world only the European
and American cultures have attempted to impose their values and thoughts
on others as well as to put them beneath their immediate control. Colonialist
aims were to subdue other cultures, take riches from their land and to expand
their countries&iacute; influence throughout the world. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These people were first subdued by the use of arms, and
then they were &igrave;imprisoned.&icirc; Lastly, came the philosophical
side. To keep control the colonialists had to make the native people believe
they were inferior to them. Franz Fanon wrote in his book The Wretched of
the Earth that the Africans were led to believe they were sub-human. After
so much oppression and propaganda, some people may begin to believe this.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is what has happened in the Middle East. This propaganda
that was instilled years ago has taken root in the minds of today&iacute;s
young people as they believe themselves and their culture to be inferior
to the European and American cultures. Today we find Arab people wanting
American products and watching American films. Many attend English speaking
schools. They look down on their Arab culture as something &igrave;foreign&icirc;
and outdated. Some Arab students who have lived all their lives in Arab
countries and go to American or British schools speak English strongly,
yet they can barely speak Arabic and cannot read Arabic. What is this? If
you live in a country you should know its language. It is good to learn
other languages. It is my personal belief that every human should know at
least two or three languages so there can exist more understanding between
cultures. However, in the process, one should not lose his native language.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One will find most Americans and Europeans proud of their
countries and cultures even when their countries have blundered. Yet, what
has happened to the Arab pride? Arabs need to reassess themselves and their
cultures without looking through Western glasses. They need to look objectively
and reclaim their heritage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Americans are so proud of their culture that most do
not bother to learn another language. They believe others should learn English.
This is closed-minded, but it is true. They believe so much in their culture
that they have pushed it on the whole world. Their music and films are everywhere.
Most of all, the English language is the most influential language in the
world. It has become the language of business, medicine and education. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Once long ago, the Arab (Islamic) culture was on the forefront.
People from all over Europe came to Cordova and Cairo to study. The language
of education was Arabic. The Europeans were just coming out of the Dark
Ages. They took their &igrave;technology&icirc; and education from the Muslims.
Thus, they progressed and the Renaissance sprang forth. Yet, they took only
the culture and the education, but not the religion of Islam. If we take
anything from America, we should take only their technology and some of
their education. However, we must start looking at our own scholars. They
do exist. Many are working in America and in Europe. Arabs can contribute,
learn and be successful while keeping their Arab identity. Arab countries
need to learn to be self-sufficient and to use their minds to advance; we
do not have to take everything from abroad. We did it once, and we flourished
so well that they took from us. Now, we need to learn to take from ourselves--reclaim
our Arab heritage. Instead of Arabs wanting to run away to America and Europe,
they must stay at home and fight by facing and solving their problems while
rebuilding their society. Then, maybe we can re-attain the Arab pride that
is gradually being lost.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>GARDEN OF EDEN</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>BY E. YAGHI</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The noise of the city thundered in Yahya's ears and blotted
out the songs of the early morning sparrows. The aroma of jasmine and roses
drifted up to greet him as he reluctantly climbed into a private taxi and
headed for work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Cars honked relentlessly and the taxi driver swore at various
offenders. The driver spat out of his half opened window and then flipped
out a cigarette from a box beside him, pushed the car lighter into its socket
and nervously lit his cigarette. Yahya sat in the back of the car to avoid
the driver's company and to meditate in the few minutes he had before reaching
his job as engineer at a multinational company somewhere in Suburbia. He
choked on the gray smoke that clouded even the back seat and stared with
watery eyes at the madness about him. His dark reddish brown hair curled
in ringlets around his face while his brows wrinkled in frustration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When he reached his destination, he gave the driver a quick,
&quot;Stop here, please,&quot; and jumped out of the car, reached in his
pockets and pulled out some money with &quot;how much?&quot; He paid the
required amount, grabbed his briefcase and told the driver, &quot;thank
you.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Slowly he entered the huge glass facade building, shuffling
his feet hesitantly. After he entered the office, he passed an array of
secretaries and with amber eyes and mustached mouth, greeted them with a
&quot;good morning,&quot; pushing on into his own chambers where he flopped
his briefcase down on his large desk and sunk into his blue swivel chair.
A few hours later, he had immersed himself in paperwork, frequently chewing
on the lid of his pen and scratching his head in thought.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the secretaries entered his office and said, &quot;Sorry
to disturb you Yahya, but Mr. Dawwas would like to see you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He ignored the attractive face of the secretary and disregarded
her pleasant smile. He normally would stop for a chat or a joke or two,
but this time he trudged to his boss's office, dreading another encounter.
He knocked on the brown door and somewhere deep inside, a gruff &quot;come
in&quot; commanded him to enter. He cautiously shoved open the door and
entered, his expression questioning his superior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Well, come closer! Don't stand so far away,&quot;
Mr. Dawwas growled. &quot;I've got a few issues to discuss with you. I consider
you intelligent, but, I don't like your honest attitude. Too much honesty
is a hindrance. I didn't get where I am just being a nice guy. Furthermore,
I must insist you be more assertive towards those under you. Now, I've got
a job I need done. If you refuse to perform it, then I'll have to consider
your dismissal. If you comply, there will be certain benefits including
perhaps an increase in pay as well as promotion.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yahya felt the rough yet magnetic glare of his boss. He
cast his own eyes downward, breaking the lock. &quot;Sir, if it's about
taking advantage of the poor or lying or cheating as you suggested before,
then I'm sorry. I can't fulfill your request. It's not my nature to be deceitful.
Not for money or power!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He felt his eyes being pulled hypnotically to those of
his employer. The fiery glint that had been there before extinguished and
Mr. Dawwas's eyes grew cold and his face hard as he bellowed, &quot;Very
well. As you please. But don't say I didn't try to help you. I will consider
your words and think about what to do with you. No one is indispensable,
no matter how clever. Please leave!&quot; and he motioned to his door with
a dismissing hand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yahya had expected something like this to happen. He turned
on his heels and thrust himself out of the office entrance, his face red
with embarrassment. After he returned to his own office, he thought about
Mr. Dawwas' demands as he toyed with his pen. At length he grabbed his briefcase
and stormed out of the building. That was it. He couldn't work for a man
he hated. A man he thought unjust and evil. But nevertheless, Yahya thought
of himself as a failure and hung his had in self-accusations as he returned
to his home where he lived with some of his friends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He changed from his stiff business suit to some more causal
trousers, scratched a quick note on a piece of paper and left. He took a
bus out of Suburbia away from the noise and confusion. Seemingly in the
middle of nowhere, he stopped the bus and descended to freedom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He struck out for a small clearing where he whiffed the
fresh mountain air. His chest expanded and a smile crept across a face that
not long before had frowned in resentment. His bag landed on the ground
with a thump and Yahya threw himself beside it and leaned against a fir
tree. The odors of the forest filled his nostrils and the scolding of nearby
birds delighted him. He reached for his bag and pulled out a flute on which
he played a melancholy tune to the lavender wild flowers and evergreen trees.
A small breeze tossed his curls, giving him a boyish look.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He quit playing his flute, sighed and spoke to the unseen
residents of the forest. &quot;Why is it that some people grow rich from
the poverty of others? Why must the rich rule the poor and lies govern truth?
I thought I could change the world with my degree and hopes but I can't
even change one company or even the ideas of one man. I must be a misfit.
Ideas of love, charity, sharing and giving seem to be fashions of the past.
Is chivalry dead? I am tired of competition, tired of adulating masses who
worship power, money and glory. I want to be simple and honest.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In despair he rose, brushed himself off, clutched his bag
and began to walk. The mountain air filled his lungs as he plowed through
thorn scrub with his shoes. At times he bent down and pulled a thistle from
his leg and then continued on down a winding path towards a green valley.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As he sauntered with refreshed spirits, he thought he heard
someone crying. He stopped to listen as a small voice moaned, &quot;Oh,
please, somebody help me!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He waited to determine the direction of the cry and upon
hearing it again, made his way to the sound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He searched for the voice and then in surprise discovered
a young boy hugging a distorted foot. The boy's face was stained with tears
and twisted in pain. When he caught sight of Yahya, the boy's countenance
brightened. &quot;Hello there,&quot; Yahya called. &quot;What's wrong with
you boy? Did you hurt your foot?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Yes, sir. I was on my way back to my village when
I caught my foot on some bramble bushes and tripped. When I tried to get
up and walk, my foot hurt me so much that I fell down again. Please, can
you help me?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So, the compassionate Yahya bundled the boy on his back,
struggled with his bag and limped to the village. He was greeted as a hero
and the boy was carefully lifted off Yayah's back and taken away to have
his foot mended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yahya never left the small village. Instead he fell in
love with it and considered it to be a safe haven apart from the din, confusion
and greed of</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>the world. He applied his education to the needs of the
humble honest folk in a place he considered to be his Garden of Eden. On
quiet nights if you pass Yayah's village, you may still hear him playing
a sweet tune on his silver flute in the midst of the ringing laughter of
his happy wife and children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for his greedy boss, God does not forget the bad deeds
a person performs. The boss became severely paralyzed and was unable to
continue his life of crime and evil. He now sits in a lonely wheelchair
attended by one faithful servant and is shut away from the honest and pure
pleasures of life.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Citizen and the State</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A comparative study of citizenship legislation
in Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Author: Uri Davis</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Published 28 August 1997</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>224pp , 235 x 155 mm, Price: 30 Sterling
Pounds</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In this analysis of the relationship between the individual
and the state and the ideas of citizenship, sovereignty and national self-determination
as played out in the Levant, Dr. Uri Davis introduces a new conceptual framework
for the Middle East. In doing so, he unlocks many of the critical issues
which confront the region today: democratization, the role of religion in
the state, human rights and the prospects of political stability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Taking the idea of citizenship as the point of departure,
the book critically examines the call for a &quot;new Middle East&quot;,
which figures centrally in the regional and international political narrative
that has emerged since the Gulf War and the launch of the Middle East regional
peace process in Madrid in 1991. The subsequent Israel-PLO negotiations
concluded in Oslo and signed in Washington in 1993 (Oslo I) and 1995 (Oslo
II) are likewise subjected to critical examination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Five detailed case-studies follow, wherein Uri Davis examines
the citizenship legislation of the four states of the Levant&oacute;Israel,
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon-and of the Palestinian Authority, particularly
in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant United
Nations covenants. Much of this material is made available to the English
readership for the first time here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Addressing some of the most intractable problems of the
Levant, Dr. Davis's important study breaks new ground for change in the
Arab world. He presents an argument for a federal Middle East modelled on
the European Union, and his conclusions have a direct bearing on the Palestine
