<H3><CENTER>The Big &quot;Why&quot; after the Deal at &quot;Wye&quot;!</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&quot;Why now?&quot; asked Palestinian negotiators in response
to the bombings that followed the signing of the Wye Plantation
agreement at the White House. Some even went as far as explicitly
saying that they wished Hamas or Islamic Jihad had attacked Israeli
targets during the stalemate period that preceded the 'breakthrough'
and not after they managed to extract a pledge of 'withdrawal'.
It is ironic that both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are presently accused
of acting upon orders from foreign powers-Syria and Iran-to destroy
the peace process, only weeks prior to the Wye Plantation meetings.
Yasser Arafat complained bitterly to a crowd of Egyptian politicians
and journalists in Cairo that Hamas had let him down. He said
then that he wished Hamas would carry out a 'big operation' to
bolster his negotiating position vis-&agrave;-vis the Israelis.
The allegations made by senior PLO officials have raised questions.
Had Hamas done something when its action was, from a PLO perspective,
most needed, would it still have been considered a lackey to some
foreign power? What about the allegiances of the PLO in the aftermath
of Oslo and in the wake of Wye? How would one describe the relationship
between the PLO and Israel on the one hand and between the PLO
and the CIA on the other? There is no shortage of evidence that
the ongoing Middle East peace process is taking place not between
Israel and the Palestinians but rather between Israel and a group
of Palestinian 'adventurers' who, in exchange for a set of personal
privileges, agreed to become an indispensable party to the project
aimed at prolonging the life of the State of Israel. It is not
surprising thus that not only have improvements not taken place
in the life of the majority of the Palestinians as a consequence
to the process but that conditions since the peace agreement was
first implemented have continued to deteriorate. </P>

<P>One of the most disturbing results of the process is the fragmentation,
and consequently the isolation, of the Palestinian community.
The 1967-occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank and Gaza
has been divided into three zones: Zone A, the tiniest of all,
which is administered and security-controlled by the Palestinian
Authority (PA); Zone B, which is administered by the PA but security-controlled
by the Israeli army; and Zone C, by far the largest of all three
zones, which is both administered and security-controlled by the
Israeli military authorities. </P>

<P>Promulgated in Oslo in 1993 and consolidated via a series of
agreements since then, the Israeli-PLO partnership has transformed
the Palestinian issue from a national struggle for the liberation
of occupied Palestine to a civil administration and security-control
of the Arab Palestinian community in the occupied territories.
The recent Wye Plantation agreement has served to illustrate only
too clearly the manner in which this transformation has been taking
place-from a struggle for Palestinian rights to serving Israeli
interests. </P>

<P>The reason the summit was called for in the first place was
to break what seemed to be a deadlock in the peace process and
to avert the prospect of a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
State (most probably in the widely spaced apart Zone A) by next
May as threatened by Yasser Arafat in response to Israeli intransigence.
</P>

<P>The deadlock was augmented by the surprise acceptance by the
PA and rejection by the Israeli Government of a U.S. proposed
plan to revive the peace process. The Americans proposed an Israeli
redeployment from 13% of the West Bank instead of the 40% stipulated
in the Oslo accords, as interpreted by the Palestinians, in exchange
for the PA's commitment to eradicate 'terrorism'. Reportedly it
was the Israeli left, represented by the Labour Party, which lobbied
the PA to accept the U.S. initiative on the assumption that this
would turn out to be a Palestinian diplomatic triumph and an embarrassment
for the Likud Government of Israel, which would still not accept
the offer even though it entails a major concession on the part
of the Palestinians.</P>

<P>In spite of what seemed to be a breakthrough, the Likud administration
insisted that the Palestinian partners could not be trusted to
deliver on their security commitments and pledged, therefore,
not to hand over any more territory unless security was 100% guaranteed.
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu had his reasons for
stalling, displaying all he could devise of delaying tactics.
He had a political constituency to watch out for, and it could
be extremely hazardous for him to be accused of doing exactly
what Arafat's former partner, Prime Minister Rabin, had done and
for which he paid with his life. But he could not, on the other
hand, afford to jeopardize an Israeli, not only profitable but
golden opportunity, investment in Yasser Arafat and the PA. It
was by virtue of this investment that Israel brought the Palestinian
uprising (intifadah) to an end and secured the removal of so many
barriers that in the past hindered the establishment of diplomatic
and economic ties with so many nations around the world and particularly
in the Arab region.</P>

<P>So, Netanyahu came up with the figure of 9% as an alternative.
This was rejected by the Palestinians, and a breakthrough had
yet to be found. The Americans, who had their reasons for wanting
to ensure that the deadlock was resolved and that the peace process
was back on track, continued relentlessly the efforts to broker
a deal. Eventually, both Netanyahu and Arafat agreed to a modified
initiative known as the &quot;10 plus 3&quot; plan. The Americans
brought the two leaders and their negotiating teams to Wye Plantation
in Maryland for marathon negotiations that ended in both sides
agreeing on a number of steps believed to have the ability to
revitalize the peace process and pave the way for final status
negotiations. The most important of these steps is the land for
security arrangement. In exchange for a CIA-monitored 100% commitment
on the part of the PA to combat 'terrorism', as well as incitement
of 'terrorism', against Israel, the Israeli Government would execute
a redeployment of its troops from 13% of the West Bank. The 13%
'withdrawal' is understood to consist of the following: 3% is
to be designated as a nature reserve whose security is Israel's
sole responsibility; 1% is to be transferred from Zone C to Zone
A; and 12% is to be transferred from Zone C to Zone B. In addition,
the Israelis would be expected to authorize the transfer of 14.2%
from Zone B to Zone A. Once implemented, these transfers would
mean that 18.2% of the entire Palestinian territory will be categorized
as Zone A (PA administration and security control); 21.8% as Zone
B (PA administration and Israeli security control); and 60% as
Zone C (100% Israeli administration and security control). In
addition to the security pledges, the PA has agreed to convene
the PLO Executive Committee in order to announce the official
abrogation of specific articles within the Palestinian Charter,
which call for the liberation of Palestine. This will then be
followed by convening the Palestinian Central Council to ratify
the decision taken by the Executive Committee. Finally, a combined
meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian Central
Council, the Palestinian Legislative Council and the Palestinian
Cabinet will be held in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton
to collectively endorse the abrogation of the said articles in
the Charter.</P>

<P>The Israelis have also agreed to release 750 out of a total
of about 4,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, it soon became
apparent that the prisoners to be released, who will be freed
in three batches over a period of six months, would have finished
their sentences by the date of their emancipation. Gaza Airport
will, as part of the deal, be put into operation, but Israel maintains
overall security and customs control. Israel agreed to exempt
only the aircraft of 'his Excellency the President' from inspection.
However, his Excellency's departure and arrival will still have
to be approved every time by the relevant Israeli authorities.
It is worth noting that moving from one canton to the other within
Zone A, Arafat is required to procure Israeli permission.</P>

<P>The Wye Plantation deal is seen by many Palestinian observers
as a serious setback. Even those who still had some hope that
the peace process might get something for the Palestinians view
this development with skepticism. The Palestinian negotiating
team failed to demand guarantees, in exchange for the security
guarantees the Israelis demanded and obtained, for an end to the
expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. It
is an undisputed fact that settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
are a major cause of tension between the Arabs and the Israelis.
It would be na&iuml;ve to imagine that peace could ever be established
without an immediate halt in settlement activities.</P>

<P>It is ironic that both wings of Israeli politics seem to agree,
despite the rhetoric, that West Bank and Gaza settlements are
indispensable to Israel's security as well as to domestic political
stability. Immediately following his return from Washington, the
Israeli Prime Minister authorized the building of new settlements,
as well as the expansion of already existing ones, to appease
his right-wing supporters in the cabinet and in parliament and
to prove his commitment in spite of the promised 'redeployment'
of Israel's security. Nor did the Palestinian team demand guarantees
to safeguard the security of the Palestinians or to protect them
from attacks by Israeli troops and Jewish settlers. While Israel
expects the PA to crack down as severely and as brutally as it
can on those accused, or suspected, of attacks on Israelis, Israel
is under no obligation to crack down, let alone punish, Israelis
who attack Palestinians. It is worth noting that over the past
two years Jews killed more than four times as many Palestinians
as were Jews by Palestinians.</P>

<P>The continued apprehension of thousands of Palestinians, the
crackdown on those whom Israel accuses of posing a threat to its
security, the continuation of settlement programmes, and the unrestrained
attacks on Palestinians by Israeli troops and Jewish settlers
will only serve to perpetuate violence throughout occupied Palestine.
In other words, the failure to respond to Palestinian needs will
only lead to the failure of whatever Israel and the PA agree on
of measures and actions aimed at preserving Israel's security.
Israel's inability to deal with the Palestinian population except
through a colonial mentality ensures that it will remain, in the
eyes of the majority of the Palestinians, an alien occupier that
cannot but be resisted. More explicitly, Israeli policies provide
the Palestinians with daily reminders that their most noble cause
would be to drive the Israelis out of the land. It is Israel itself,
more than anything else, which provides legitimacy for the armed
struggle against its occupation forces and settlers. It is this
very point that many commentators on the Palestinian issue fail
to address, especially as they attempt to explain the resumption
of military attacks on Israeli targets. </P>

<P>So long as the Palestinians are viewed as sub-human while the
Jews are viewed as super-human, no peace will ever prevail. So
long as justice is denied to the Palestinians, it will not be
difficult to recruit desperate young men who prefer a one-way
trip to heaven than to live miserably under dual oppression-both
Israeli and Palestinian security forces. It is neither peace-hating
nor anti-Semitism but rather a combination of injustice, deprivation
and persecution that fuels the vicious cycle of violence in Palestine.
It is this very combination, which the ongoing peace process fails
to address, that provides legitimacy for resistance against Israeli
occupation. However, the Israelis are too arrogant to reconsider,
the PA officials are too intoxicated to feel, and the Americans
have neither the sight nor the hearing to have any sense. </P>

<P><B><I>Following is the full text of a memorandum by the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) concerning the Wye River Memorandum
signed on 23 October 1998 by the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
and the Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat under the
sponsorship of the U.S. President Clinton.</I></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The Wye River Memorandum of
23 October 1998<BR>
Its Indications and Consequences</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B><I>27 October 1998</I></B></P>

<P>After eight days of negotiations between Netanyahu's Government
and the Palestinian Authority at Wye River, Maryland, the United
States of America, the two parties, under the direct sponsorship
of the U.S. Administration, concluded an agreement pertaining
to the application of the redeployment of the Israeli occupation
troops in the West Bank as provided for in the former agreements.
This agreement will be implemented in conjunction with a pledge
by the PA to take strict and specific security measures against
the forces of the Palestinian People that reject any relinquishments
and that also resist the Occupation, in particular the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas). The agreement was signed on Friday,
23 October 1998 at the White House.</P>

<P>In view of the dangers of this agreement and its negative consequences
to the Palestinian Cause and to the present and future conditions
of the whole region, we, in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
would like to introduce this memorandum directly to our People
and Nation as part of our duty to enlighten and warn them. In
addition, we strongly encourage everyone to play their role in
defending Palestine's Cause, its people and its holy places, as
well as to work seriously to prevent the expansion of the Zionist
project at the expense of the Nation's interests now and in the
future.</P>

<P><B><U>First: The main comments on the agreement's provisions</U></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">1- </FONT></B>The Wye River Memorandum
tackles five subjects: the redeployment, security, economic issues,
the final status talks and the unilateral activities. The agreement
details the security issues making it, formally and practically,
a non-political security accord.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">2- </FONT></B>The Wye River Memorandum
considers the &quot;Note for the Record&quot; by the U.S. of 17
January 1997, which was annexed to the Hebron Agreement and the
Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip of 28 September
1995, as an authority to the application of the agreement. One
of the most serious ramifications of this Memorandum is the recognition
of Israel's sole right to determine the percentage and time-schedule
of the redeployment. As long as there are no maps attached with
the new agreement, the Israeli enemy will, alone, determine the
criteria for which the redeployment will be made.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">3- </FONT></B>Although the agreement
talks about the reciprocity principle, it is free of any details
or required guarantees from the Enemy. It was satisfied with what
was mentioned in the prior agreements. However, the present agreement
describes in detail a list of commitments and relinquishments
that must be carried out by the PA.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">4-</FONT></B> The agreement states
that the redeployment of the Occupation troops should be linked
to the PA's commitment to the application of a time-schedule for
the security measures that must be implemented in order to encounter
the Palestinian forces that resist or call to resist the Occupation.
While the provisions concerning the commitments by the PA are
clear and specific, the commitments by the Enemy are vague and
general. Examples of the provisions regarding the different security
measures that should be implemented by the PA according to the
agreement are as follows:</P>

<P> <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&middot;</FONT></B> The ensuring
of systematic and effective combat of &quot;terrorist&quot; organizations
and their support structures along with the environment conducive
to the support of &quot;terror&quot;.<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&middot; </FONT></B>Combat should be
continuous and constant over the long term, without pause in its
implementation.<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&middot; </FONT></B>Security cooperation
between &quot;Israel&quot; and the Palestinians as well as a continuous
exchange of information, concepts and actions. The cooperation
should be &quot;bilateral, complete, continuous, intensive and
comprehensive.&quot;<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&middot;</FONT></B> A U.S.-Palestinian
committee will meet biweekly to review the steps being taken to
eliminate &quot;terrorism&quot;.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &middot; </FONT></B>A U.S.-Palestinian
committee will meet to review and evaluate information pertaining
to the decisions on prosecution, punishment or other legal measures
to be taken against suspects. The PA will abide by this condition.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &middot; </FONT></B>There must be professional
cooperation in investigations between the two parties along with
an exchange of information.<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&middot; </FONT></B>A U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli
committee will meet not less than biweekly to assess current threats
and to deal with any impediments.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &middot; </FONT></B>The Palestinian
side will fully inform the members of the committee of the results
of its investigation of suspects.<BR>
 <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&middot;</FONT></B> Instant apprehension
of 30 Palestinians wanted by the &quot;Israeli&quot; Enemy to
try them under CIA supervision.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &middot; </FONT></B>The Palestinian
side will prohibit the importation or smuggling of illegal weapons
in areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &middot;</FONT></B> The prohibition
of all forms of incitement to violence or terror. A U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli
committee will monitor cases of possible incitement to violence
or terror and exchange information in this regard.<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &middot;</FONT></B> The Palestinians
will provide the United States with a detailed security work plan
after the first week of the implementation of this agreement.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">5-</FONT></B> The agreement does not
give specific meanings for some terms such as terror, violence
and its support structures, and the concept of incitement. Instead,
it leaves this identification to the joint security committees
between the PA and the &quot;Israeli&quot; Enemy or between the
PA and the CIA, or to a trilateral committee; this means that
their definitions will be varied because the Israeli Enemy and
the CIA will be the ones who will impose their meanings.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">6-</FONT></B> The gist of the agreement
concerning the land is the agreement of the Israeli Government
on a conditional redeployment of its troops that will be in conjunction
with the implementation of strict and specific security measures
by the PA. The redeployment will be from 13% of the West Bank
area, excluding Jerusalem: 1% will be transferred to area (A)
and 12% to area (B); 3% of the latter will be allocated as Nature
Reserves (the security of which will be controlled by the Occupation
forces). In addition, 14.2% will be transferred from area (B)
to area (A). If these redeployments are implemented according
to the specified percentages, the situation of the West Bank would
be as follows:</P>

<P><B><I> &middot; 18.2% area (A) (under PA's security and administrative
control)<BR>
 &middot; 21.8% area (B) (administration run by the PA but security
by the Occupation)<BR>
 &middot; 60% area (C)  (fully controlled by the Occupation).</I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">7-</FONT></B> In addition, the agreement
mentions the operation of Gaza airport and the need to renew negotiations
on the safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank. The parties
also agreed to conclude an agreement to allow the construction
and operation of Gaza port. Issues such as the settlement, the
third phase of redeployment and other issues of the Interim Agreement
were adjourned by referring them to negotiation committees.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">8-</FONT></B> According to the agreement,
Netanyahu has obliged the Palestinian negotiators to nullify specific
provisions of the Palestinian National Charter in a humiliating
manner. The PLO's Executive Committee will start this work and
the PLO's Central Council will ratify the nullification. Then
a joint meeting will be held and attended by members of the Palestinian
National Council, the Central Council and the Palestinian ministers
to be addressed by President Clinton to reaffirm their support
for the decisions of the Executive Committee and the Central Council
regarding the nullification and the amendment of the Palestinian
National Charter.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">9-</FONT></B> The agreement does not
include any specific or clear provision that restricts the settlements
or strips the settlers of their arms.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">10-</FONT></B> Although the media
talk about an Israeli pledge to release 750 detainees out of 4,000
detainees presently in the Israeli jails in stages, the agreement
does not include a clear and specific provision regarding this
issue. Instead, it refers this issue to the &quot;prior agreements&quot;.</P>

<P><B><U>Second: Analysis of the contents and meanings of the
agreement</U></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">1-</FONT></B> The agreement reaffirmed
Netanyahu's approach, which is to renegotiate on what was already
agreed upon with the aim of increasing the Palestinian commitments
while at the same time reducing the Israeli ones. He agreed last
August to the redeployment from 13% of the occupied territories,
however, he took many Palestinian relinquishments at Wye Plantation
using this as a bargaining chip.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">2- </FONT></B>The Palestinian Authority
introduced new relinquishments, the most important of which are
as follows: <BR>
 &middot; Responding to Netanyahu's approach by accepting new
negotiations on what was already agreed upon.<BR>
 &middot; Accepting the 13% redeployment but with the added condition
of using the formula of (10+3) that was imposed by Netanyahu even
though the PA was initially demanding the redeployment from 40%
of the West Bank as stated in the Interim Agreement, then only
to turn around and agree on 13% as outlined by the American initiative.<BR>
 &middot; The 4 May 1999 deadline for the end of the final status
negotiations was left undecided, which denies the PA its negotiating
card of declaring the independent State of Palestine before that
date. The reference to that date in the agreement is general and
not binding.<BR>
 &middot; Retracting from the comprehensive solution of the Interim
period and accepting a partial solution.<BR>
 &middot; Accepting the CIA's partnership and supervision on the
implementation of the required security measures against the Palestinian
People and their forces that resist the Occupation. This puts
the PA in a position unable to free itself from any commitments
or room to maneuver, nor will it be able to declare the independent
State.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">3-</FONT></B> The agreement would
not be signed without efforts exerted by all of the U.S. Administration
in general and President Clinton in particular. Also, it will
not be implemented unless under the supervision of the U.S. Administration
through the CIA. This makes the provisions of the agreement decidedly
in favour of the Israeli concepts because of the strategic alliance
between Israel and the United States.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">4-</FONT></B> The agreement gives
the U.S. Administration represented by the CIA a big role in planning,
implementing and supervising all provisions of the agreement,
which means that the PA has accepted its lowered status of merely
an administrative authority, which is already undermined, to be
confiscated in favour of the American party. Playing this role
requires the CIA to expand its activities, increase its cadres
and to establish its own offices in the West Bank, Gaza Strip
and perhaps in other countries.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">5-</FONT></B> Although the agreement
puts an end to the freeze that has been dominating the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiation track over the past 19 months, the victory achieved
by Netanyahu's way of thinking and the generality of the provisions
pertaining to Israel's commitments enable Netanyahu, who already
does not believe in the Oslo Accords, to rid himself of the agreements
under various pretexts such as his non-conviction that the PA
would meet its commitments or that he would not be able to convince
his partners in the Government of the agreement that has just
been signed. Because there are no guarantees to implementing the
agreement by Israel, and because there are many gaps that impede
its implementation, this could be reason enough to aggravate the
situation again.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">6-</FONT></B> The agreement includes
a call to start the final status negotiations but it does not
put any restrictions on the contents of these negotiations. This
could make the Interim situation of the final status turn out
the way Netanyahu's Government has already planned.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">7-</FONT></B> The Zionist negotiators
persisted in the nullification of certain provisions of the Palestinian
National Charter and in the way it is described in the agreement.
This means that Israel was not satisfied with the PA's recognition
of the occupation and that it wants it to condemn its history
and past. It also wants to humiliate the Palestinians by obliging
them to change their convictions and ideology.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">8-</FONT></B> The agreement ignores
the issues of settlement and the settlers' arms, which is a serious
mistake and is proof that the PA is unable to protect its people
and to provide them with security. Or it could mean that the PA
does not care, which subjects the civilian Palestinians to the
savage acts and atrocities at the hands of the settlers. Is this
the security and the stability that will be achieved by the agreement?</P>

<P><B><U>Third: Consequences and dangers to the Palestinian situation</U></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">1-</FONT></B> The agreement transfers
the Palestinian Cause from a national liberation question to an
Arab demographic minority in a Zionist State. It also poses an
authority on this minority with a function to preserving the security
of the Zionist entity and to suppressing the Palestinian &quot;minority&quot;
in order to prevent them from resisting the occupation and even
from expressing their opinions regarding the resistance and removal
of occupation.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">2-</FONT></B> Because the PA is committed
to the provisions of the agreement and because there is a mechanism
to supervise the implementation of this agreement in participation
with the CIA, the PA will be involved in a direct struggle with
the Palestinian People, whether from Hamas, the Islamic Jihad
or others because they have adopted a programme to resist occupation.
The PA will also suppress the forces that have views supporting
the resistance under the pretext of incitement. It will even suppress
the pro-PA forces when the PA starts collecting their weapons.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">3- </FONT></B>As a result of the PA's
atrocities of combating the resistance programme; silencing the
opposition forces; suppressing the journalists; arresting the
Muslim scholars, notables, politicians and thinkers; breaking
up the Zakat (alms) committees, social and charitable establishments
under the pretext that they support the resistance; and destroying
the mosques, media and cultural institutions under the pretext
that they incite people to resist the occupation, the Palestinian
society is facing a state of confusion and instability as well
as internal conflicts that may develop into a civil war that in
the end only benefits the Israeli Occupation, which has been working
on that objective and knows that the agreement is pushing the
Palestinian people in that direction.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">4-</FONT></B> The unilateral implementation
of the agreement will enable Israel to establish its occupation
and superiority over the whole of the Palestinian territories
and to close the file of the Palestinian Cause under the pretext
that the Palestinian People have obtained an authority of administration
and services in the highly populated areas, while the majority
of the West Bank remains under the control of the Israeli Occupation
to build more settlements. The fate of the Palestinian People
in the West Bank will become the same as the Palestinian People
in the territories occupied in 1948.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">5-</FONT></B> The expanded role of
the CIA in the agreement, which includes participating in investigations,
the monitoring of the courts' sentences, adding details to the
concept of incitement, collecting information and performing their
own investigations, makes the U.S. Administration a direct enemy
in the eyes of the Palestinian People and another tyrant that
has developed its previous role in supporting the Zionist enemy
into a direct role of suppressing our People and hatching plots
against them. This will complicate the situation more and undermine
the stability to which the peace process supposedly aims.</P>

<P><B><U>Fourth: Consequences and dangers to the Arab and Islamic
situation</U></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">1-</FONT></B> The implementation of
the agreement will open the region to the Israeli Enemy, because
it undermines the steadfastness of the Palestinian People and
their ability to resist the occupation by involving them with
internal disputes causing the dismantling of their national unity.
Consequently, the Enemy will be in a position to confiscate more
Palestinian land, erect more settlements and Judaize the region
before shifting to the expected procedure of expelling more of
the Palestinians to the neighbouring Arab countries. This agreement
harms the Palestinian question and the Arab and Islamic interests
as well.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">2-</FONT></B> The agreement encourages
the isolation of the Palestinian question from its Arab and Islamic
dimensions. It gives the American-Zionist alliance an additional
card to separate the Palestinian track from the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks while simultaneously pressuring Syria and other Arab countries
to make similar agreements. The Israeli Enemy will be stronger
in any future bilateral or regional negotiations, especially with
their unlimited U.S. support.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">3-</FONT></B> The agreement helps
the Israeli Enemy and the United States to continue imposing regional
security plans to protect the Zionist entity and to dominate the
region. These plans will also prevent the countries of the region
from procuring advanced technology of weaponry and atomic energy.
The Israeli-Turkish military alliance could be the beginning in
this regard.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">4-</FONT></B> As a result of the partnership
between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority,
which was boosted by the agreement, the PA, virtually and necessarily,
will be involved in the alliances between Israel and some countries
of the region. The Zionist enemy will also make use of the PA's
relations with the Arab countries by making the PA an instrument
for spying, pressuring or persuading them to achieve the Zionist
interests, especially because the Zionist entity has already succeeded
in planting its agents within the PA's services.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">5-</FONT></B> In view of the expanded
role of the U.S. Administration in the implementation of the agreement,
it will request, as it did before, the Arab and Islamic countries
to stop the financial resources they give to the Palestinian People
and their civil and social institutions under the pretext that
they support what it calls &quot;violence and terrorism&quot;.
The U.S. Administration, encouraged by the PA itself, will pressure
these countries to sever their relations with the Hamas Movement
in particular, although we are sure that the Arab and Islamic
attitude will not yield to these pressures that do not serve the
interests of our cause and our Nation.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">6-</FONT></B> As a result of this
hostile effort to isolate the Palestinian question from its Arab
and Islamic dimension, Jerusalem and the holy mosque of Al Aqsa
will be the victims in the final status negotiations. The Muslims'
first Qibla will remain under the control of the Zionist enemy
whose future plans include demolishing Al Aqsa and building the
so-called &quot;Third Temple&quot; on its present site.</P>

<P><B><U>Fifth: Conclusions and the required attitude</U></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">1-</FONT></B> The agreement is of
a security nature and yields to the Zionist conditions and demands.
It should be considered an instrument used to destroy the capabilities
and potential of the Palestinian People, along with their civil
society, institutions and national unity. It will cause instability
in the region in a way that serves the Zionist-American interests
at the expense of the interests of the Arab and Muslim people.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">2-</FONT></B> The combating of the
agreement and its consequences is not exclusive to the Hamas Movement,
the other Palestinian opposition forces, or even the Palestinian
People in general. It is rather the duty of the Arab and Islamic
governments and people.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">3- </FONT></B>The PA began the implementation
of the security provisions of the agreement from the first moment
after signing the agreement. It arrested the journalists who visited
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to interview him concerning the agreement.
The PA's security forces also started an arrest campaign against
members and supporters of Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements. They
also arrested Sheikh Hamed Al Bitawi, the khatib of Al Aqsa Mosque
and President of the Palestine Ulam' League, after he gave a statement
to a TV channel via telephone, and Sheikh Nafez Azzam of the Islamic
Jihad after his speech in a rally in Gaza. The Palestinian Military
Intelligence raided Fateh Movement's office in Ramallah to confiscate
weapons and opened fire at a peaceful demonstration organized
by Fateh supporters, killing a young Palestinian supporter and
injuring others, causing increased tension in the city.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">4-</FONT></B> In view of the dangerous
situation that makes it impossible to wait or to give a chance
to examine the agreement, we, the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), call upon our Palestinian People to be aware of the reality
of the agreement, which destroys the present and future of our
Palestinian Cause, and which destroys the achievements and attainments
over the past decades. We also appeal to all popular forces and
activists to unite their ranks to defend the rights of their people,
institutions, security and national unity.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">5-</FONT></B> We call upon all Arab
and Islamic government and popular forces to take the initiative
to voice their views about the agreement and its dangers, and
to press the PA, using all means possible, to prevent it from
cracking down on the Palestinian Jihadi forces and from igniting
an internal war, which would put the Palestinian People at the
mercy of the Zionist ghoul. If the Palestinian wall of unity collapses,
the Zionist flood would sweep the whole Nation.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">6- </FONT></B>On this occasion, the
Hamas Movement is fully confident that no part of the agreement,
or the Zionist enemy, or the Palestinian Authority will be able
to uproot the resistance of our People or to prevent them from
continuing their resistance programme.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">7- </FONT></B>Finally, while we in
Hamas condemn this agreement and warn of its dangers and consequences
to our People, our cause and our Nation, if the PA insists on
implementing its contents and playing the role of the servant
and the instrument of the Occupation, we reiterate our stand prohibiting
Palestinian-Palestinian fighting. We also reiterate our keenness
to preserve National Unity. We shall be firm in rejecting oppression
and the Occupation while at the same time very positive in maintaining
Palestinian unity and directing our People towards the resistance
of the Enemy in order to build their present and future. We shall
remain, by the Will of God, beside our People and Nation, and
defend our legitimate rights, land and holy places until we achieve
victory, liberation and the return of our People to their homeland.</P>

<P>Everyone should learn that the Right will triumph and the falsehood
will no doubt be removed, even if it is bristling with arms and
supported by all earthly powers.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Wye? For a War on the Palestinian People&#133;</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Munir Shafiq*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>In the agreements that foreran the one hammered out recently
at Wye Plantation, Zionist and U.S. Mideast policy makers sought
to dispose of all Palestinian demands for recovering Palestinian
land, regaining Jerusalem, returning refugees, ending the occupation,
or dismantling settlements. Then the Wye Plantation deal came
to dispose of the resistance of the Palestinian People to Zionism
and its policies on their land. So in the Oslo I and Oslo II Agreements,
everything relating to Palestinian fundamentals and rights was
confiscated, either theoretically or practically or was set to
move in that direction in the long-run. At Wye Plantation, on
the other hand, most of the aforementioned was reaffirmed, but
only to turn next to the business of managing and controlling
the Palestinian People in what fell into place essentially as
a deal on security.</P>

<P>Mistaken are those who think that this security deal is directed
solely against the armed resistance against the Zionist occupation
however. It is in fact directed against the collective soul, consciousness
and psyche of the Palestinian People. It is directed against Palestinian
patriotism, historical memory, and against the backbone of the
values that the Palestinian People hold, whether regarding the
usurpation and occupation of Palestinian land, or regarding hopes
and dreams and the Arab and Islamic identity of Palestine. This
is the meaning in the Wye Plantation security deal of the references
to curbing anti-Zionist sedition, revising Palestinian educational
curricula, censoring Palestinian media, and undermining the infrastructures
that nurture &quot;terrorism&quot;. The term terrorism here does
not refer strictly to armed resistance against the occupation
either. It encompasses all criticism of &quot;Israeli&quot; policies,
the Hebrew State, the Zionist ideology, or the intrinsic injustices
each of those visits upon the Palestinian People. </P>

<P>In other words the security deal should not be read and tackled
as if it is directed against Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, or the
other Palestinian opposition groups exclusively. It should be
read as a deal directed mainly against the identity, consciousness
and soul of the Palestinian People because that is the meaning
of the references to uprooting the stems of [Palestinian] &quot;terrorism&quot;,
or the references to the primary sources that nurture &quot;terrorism&quot;
that must be destroyed to destroy it. The tale of resistance that
the Palestinian cause has known tells plainly of how the exit
of one resistance movement from the arena, as happened to Fatah,
the main faction of the PLO, was not the end of the road but the
beginning of the entry of a new resistance movement to replace
it. Therefore, it was inevitable for those who have sought in
vain to stamp out the Palestinian cause to hold the view that
the &quot;offender&quot; must be the Palestinian People.</P>

<P>This of course is the precursor for ideas and plans like &quot;drying
up the wells of terrorism&quot;, &quot;undermining terrorist infrastructure&quot;,
&quot;curbing sedition&quot; and suffocating anything that could
generate opposition, resistance movements, or mass uprisings.
Thus, in addition to re-amending the Palestinian National Charter,
the Wye deal discusses the appointment of education and media
experts and a law enforcement representative from each side to
formulate a Palestinian law dealing with all forms of sedition.<BR>
It should be noted, however, that this approach has been tried
for the last hundred years on the Palestinian People without success.
Today, here are the Zionists and their cohorts going at it again
from more unjust positions than ever before. And they will fail
again even in achieving the partial objective of rooting out Hamas
and other opposition groups. Then they will fail again and again
in achieving the broader objective of destroying the resistance
and the spirit of the Palestinian People. For they must realize
that the problem at hand is not technical to have a simplistic
security solution, but is a political one. As for the first signs
of failure, suffice it to say that the Wye Plantation security
deal was met with unambiguous irritation even by those who said
they could agree to whatever Palestinian negotiators agree to,
which poses the Wye Plantation deal in the context of the broader
political regional picture.</P>

<P>The seriousness of what took place at the Plantation exceeds
the magnitude and depravity of Palestinian concessions made there.
The Wye Plantation deal has to be assessed in terms of its negative
impact on the Arab landscape as well. Particularly, the deal will
weaken Syria's and Lebanon's negotiating positions, and strengthen
&quot;Israel's&quot; regional hand against larger Arab States
such as Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and even Morocco. The U.S.
administration has already urged Arab States to resume normalization
with &quot;Israel&quot; before ironing out differences with Netanyahu's
Government on numerous issues ranging from settlement activity
to his policies towards Arab States. Some smaller Arab States
are heeding the call. The larger Arab regimes stand disarmed and
threatened. At the same time, no significant Palestinian achievements
were sealed in Wye. In that sense, the security deal has escalated
the confrontation in the region rather than helping bring about
peace and justice.</P>

<P>Not too long ago, relations between Clinton and Netanyahu were
much less than cordial. Enormous pressure was exerted on Clinton
by the Zionist lobby and Likud hawks in Congress in open blackmail
for more policy concessions in the Mideast. </P>

<P>Scandals abounded as the media joined in the fray. Republicans
made alliances with &quot;Israel's&quot; supporters against Clinton,
then they were sacrificed by Netanyahu on the altar of Wye Plantation.
For now, Clinton seems to have delivered his protection dues.
Part of that was securing from Palestinians concessions even on
the little bit that was promised them in Oslo I and II. </P>

<P>Another part has translated into U.S. Government promises of
more advanced weaponry, financial backing, and security cooperation
with &quot;Israel&quot;, especially with respect to having the
loathsome CIA directly handle Palestinian security. But the third
and most important part of Clinton's payoff to Netanyahu has been
in the form of more blind political U.S. backing for &quot;Israel&quot;.
For example, the U.S. Government implicitly blessed the Turkish
mobilization on Syria's northern border. </P>

<P>Here the insult Netanyahu and Sharon directed at the American
people and American national security, by demanding the release
of the &quot;Israeli&quot; spy Jonathan Pollard, rears its ugly
head. The strange twist is that Clinton, who already jeopardized
his position as Head of State with numerous scandals, echoed the
insult by promising to try to release Pollard, a promise that
will likely be condemned by the American military establishment
and the CIA!! </P>

<P>Consequently, if Wye Plantation is to become the model for
what is to follow in the next stages of the negotiations, that
means the cause of Palestine has become more threatened than ever
before. But this will never become a fait accompli because the
Palestinian, Arab and Muslim peoples, and the free people of the
world, will never let that happen in the long haul.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Why &quot;Wye&quot; Serves Israel</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Erik Paul</B></CENTER></P>

<P>On 15 November, south of the little town of Bethlehem, clashes
broke out between dozens of Palestinians and Israeli soldiers
when Israeli troops bulldozed Arab land near the West Bank village
of Al Khader.  Several Palestinians were taken to hospital suffering
from tear-gas inhalation and injuries incurred from being shot
at with rubber bullets.  </P>

<P>Arab land was confiscated and bulldozed following the Israeli
Government's authorization of the seizure of hundreds of hectares
of Palestinian land for the construction of a &quot;bypass road&quot;
for Jewish settlers.  Palestinians say the purpose of this seizure
of more Palestinian land is to expand Israeli control over as
much territory as possible ahead of negotiations on the final
borders of Palestinian territory.</P>

<P>Villagers in Al Khader said army bulldozers began uprooting
hundreds of olive trees and vineyards in the area and then stopped
briefly to give residents there time to exercise their right of
appeal against land confiscation in Israeli courts.  But the army
policy abruptly changed again when Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu and his top security officials decided to go ahead with
the bypass road programme.</P>

<P>Such Israeli unilateral actions as land confiscation is a violation
of clauses in the Wye River accord barring such actions that change
the status quo in the Occupied Territories.</P>

<P>The confiscation of land in Al Khader is but one of a series
of intransigent Israeli acts.  Netanyahu has also ordered tenders
to be published for building entirely new settlements in Abu Ghneim,
and he also allows Jews to settle in Ras Al Amoud, which is in
the heart of the Arab Quarter of East Jerusalem.  The Wye agreement
of 23 October 1998 will give only partial control to the Palestine
Authority-less than 50% of the West Bank territory. </P>

<P>What the Wye agreement has done is provide more security for
all Israelis at the expense of the Palestinians and their land.
 No one has mentioned security for Palestinians against the confiscation
of their land, the demolition of their homes and the Judaization
of Jerusalem.</P>

<P>Israeli police closed down a theatre in Arab East Jerusalem
to prevent Palestinians from holding a political meeting there
on Sunday, 15 November.  Palestinians hope to make East Jerusalem
the capital of an independent State of their own. Israel occupied
East Jerusalem in 1967 and illegally annexed it as part of the
&quot;eternal capital&quot; of the Jewish State even though the
annexation has not been recognized by the international community.</P>

<P>When PA Chairman Yasser Arafat renewed his vow to unilaterally
declare Palestinian Statehood in May of 1999, when the interim
peace accords with Israel expire, Netanyahu reaffirmed that Israel
would view such a move as a de facto cancellation of the peace
accords and that such a declaration might lead to further Israeli
annexation of more Palestinian land.  Netanyahu considers the
rightful declaration of a Palestinian State as undermining the
Wye agreement, but he does not regard his own confiscation of
Palestinian land, his demolition of Palestinian homes, the continued
expansion of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land, the construction
of bypass roads or the Judaization of Jerusalem as undermining
anything at all.</P>

<P>On Monday, 16 November, Netanyahu announced that he was suspending
an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank until the Palestinians
drop plans to declare independence in May.  </P>

<P>On 13 November, the Israeli Government authorized the paving
of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including
one that will reportedly require the expropriation of thousands
of acres of Palestinian-owned land.  Nabil Amr, an adviser to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, told reporters, &quot;Such actions
create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging for the peace
process and are a direct provocation to the Palestinians.&quot;</P>

<P>What the Wye agreement really does is provide further land
for security for Israelis.  What it doesn't do is provide a Statehood
for Palestinians, stop the confiscation of more Palestinian land,
stop the demolition of Palestinian homes, stop the Judaization
of Jerusalem, or stop construction of new Jewish settlements.
 As always, the Israelis are the ones who benefit and the Palestinians
are the ones who lose more of their rights.</P>

<P>As for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, he will be merely
the man who chases and catches more Palestinians for the sake
of the Israelis.  The Wye agreement will strengthen a Palestinian
police entity within the framework of a larger Israeli police
State as far as Palestinians are concerned. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Leicester University Hosts Conference on &quot;The
Centrality<BR>
of Al Aqsa Mosque in Islam&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P><B><I>London - By Abdul Waheed Kassam</I></B><BR>
History may see the Friends of Al Aqsa conference at Leicester
University on 24 October on The Centrality of Al Aqsa in Islam
and The Threats to Al Aqsa as the beginning of the end of the
Zionist nightmare in Palestine. Over 500 British Muslim men heard
the heart-rending stories of Zionist aggression against Al Aqsa
and Palestine and were reminded by <B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Ibrahim
Hewitt </FONT></I></B>in his opening statement that the issue
was a problem for every Muslim, not just Palestinians and Arabs.
Al Aqsa was the only mosque to be named in the Holy Qur'an, but
the inaction of British Muslims made it appear as if that reference
had been excised. A British Muslim delegation had visited Palestine
in 1988 to examine the Intifadah, and concern for Al Aqsa could
not be separated from general social and political issues in Palestine.
Mentioning a conference in Jerusalem the previous month calling
to rebuild the temple to replace Al Aqsa, Hewitt impressed on
the conference participants that Al Aqsa was in real danger. Rejecting
the smear of anti-Semitism, Hewitt stated that many Jews opposed
Zionism. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hewitt</FONT> reminded Muslims that there
are Christian Palestinians, and that many Christians were pro-Palestinian.
A practical example of the latter was the presence of Christians
at the conference, and the statement by Rev. Richard Curtis, speaking
for the Assistant Bishop of Leicester, William Down, giving warmest
greetings to the event and informing the conference of the Lambeth
Conference's Resolution 20, stating that Jerusalem was a holy
city to three religions, special to both Israelis and Palestinians,
and calling for the city to be the joint capital of two States.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Dr. Daud Abdullah</FONT></I></B>
of the Palestinian Return Centre spoke of the long-term Zionist
aim to change the boundaries and religious identity of Jerusalem,
admitted by Yitzhak Rabin when East Jerusalem was occupied in
1967. From that time the indigenous people had been moved out
and new landmarks constructed, leading to 87% of the city now
being in Israeli hands, whilst Arab building projects accounted
for only 12% of the whole in 1968. To make way for a Jewish settlement,
a Muslim graveyard had been desecrated. Netanyahu had recently
annexed 12% of the West Bank to Jerusalem. In a policy of ethnic
cleansing, Palestinian homes were being demolished, repairs of
others were prohibited, and Jerusalem Arab ID cards were being
withdrawn.</P>

<P>He recounted much of the history of the Palestinian issue,
and noted many UN resolutions condemning Zionist actions. He said
that attacks on Al Aqsa usually happen in August because it is
the anniversary of the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. </P>

<P>resently, 20 Jewish groups, with support from Christian Zionists,
were attempting to destroy Al Aqsa. He called for Muslims to respond
in a &quot;more assertive&quot; and &quot;popularly oriented&quot;
fashion, and also for a body of Muslim scholars to visit Al Aqsa.</P>

<P>The Imam of Birmingham Central Mosque, <B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Shaykh
Riaz'ul Haq,</FONT></I></B> examined the history and religious
importance of Al Aqsa. Lamenting the absence of interest in Al
Aqsa, and the inclination to detach the sanctuary from Makkah
and Medina, he argued that any attack on these sanctuaries would
result in &quot;outrage&quot; and &quot;action&quot;. The sanctity
of Al Aqsa went back not just to the Miraj and 'Isra, but to creation.
The prophet Abraham, important in Islam, had made Hijra (migration)
to Al Quds (Jerusalem). The Prophet Muhammad stated that following
the Hijra to Medina, a second Hijra would occur to Al Quds, where
the people would settle. Al Quds was made a promised land after
Moses and Joshua for the Muslims in general, not only for Bani
Isra'il, and the prophet 'Issa (Jesus) was born in the blessed
land. </P>

<P>The importance of the Miraj being preceded by the 'Isra to
Al Quds, as opposed to directly from Makkah to Paradise, should
be noted. At that point, Allah told Muhammad that Al Aqsa was
the only place that the prophets prayed together. It was the first
Qiblah (direction of prayer for Muslims), and all the conquests
of the prophet Muhammad, with the exception of Makkah, had been
in its direction. It was as central to Islam as Makkah and Medina,
and the prophet Muhammad promised a thousand-fold blessing for
pilgrimage there. Muslims were banned from facing it when relieving
themselves. Al Quds was the site for the resurrection and judgment.
The prophet Muhammad stated that faithful believers would always
be present in Bait al-Maqdis.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Dr. Azzam Tamimi</FONT></I></B>
of Liberty for the Muslim World recalled that when Jerusalem was
conquered by the Muslims in May 637 AD, no looting or desecration
occurred, and Jerusalem became an open city for all religions,
the rights of Jews and Christians safeguarded by Caliph Omar.
He even refused to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to
ensure that later generations would not turn it into a mosque.
</P>

<P>When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem on a &quot;divine mission&quot;,
70,000 Jews, Muslims and Arab Christians were murdered in seven
days. Al Aqsa was turned into a barracks, and minarets were silenced
for 88 years. Under Zionism, yesterday's victims turned into today's
oppressors. Zionists acted like the Nazis and the Crusaders. This
was not true for Christianity or Judaism. Just as the crimes of
the Crusaders occasioned their fall, Zionist crimes will have
the same consequences. When that occurs, Jerusalem will again
be a city of peace and religious liberty.</P>

<P>He condemned Yasser Arafat and the &quot;peace accord&quot;
as being humiliating to Palestinians and Muslims, and compared
him unfavourably with the great hero Salah ad-Din. He acclaimed
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin of Hamas, to which the audience responded
with loud Takbirs, and upheld the right of the Palestinians to
liberate themselves, stating they would not be intimidated. Having
earlier noted the role of the British Mandate in enabling the
Zionist project, he stressed that Muslims must impress the British
people with the truth about Palestine.</P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Yusuf Islam </FONT></I></B>compared
the Bani Isra'il in Surah al-Baqarah with contemporary Muslims,
particularly their rulers, who have the attitude of subservience
and slavery to Western powers, who maintain their rule, and how
a generation of slaves who left Egypt had to die and a new generation,
not knowing slavery, had to replace them. Al-Quds was sanctified
because of the 'Isra and Miraj, making the issue vital for Aqida.
There is no reference in the Aqida to &quot;peace for land&quot;;
instead, there is the command for Jihad when Muslim land is invaded.
In this regard, Palestine was an Islamic concern, not just for
Palestinians, though they faced the test. This conference was
the symbol to Palestinian Muslims that they were not alone in
that test.</P>

<P>The Zionist State is an illegitimate entity. British Muslims
must use the freedom they had in this country to help the Palestinians
by being pro-active, not just by marches. He gave the example
of how in the Muslim schools issue, British courts, being independent
of the State, were used. At the moment they were being used in
regard to the Chilean dictator Pinochet, a man who, like the Israelis,
was a torturer. Muslims could use the courts in the same way against
Israeli soldiers, guilty of abuses, visiting Golders Green, etc.
He called for the Muslim Council of Britain, of which he was treasurer,
to take up the issue. He urged Muslims to be pro-active against
Zionist organizations raising funds for causes in Palestine.</P>

<P>The concluding speech was by the General Secretary of the Jamiat
Ulema of Transvaal, South Africa, <B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Shaykh
Ibrahim Bham</FONT></I></B>, who also affirmed that the sanctity
of Al Aqsa was coequal with that of Makkah and Medina. This sanctity
extended beyond the mosque to the whole precinct and indeed, every
inch of the city. Many of the narratives in the Qur'an, such as
those of Bani Isra'il, Moses and Mariam, happened in the area.
Prayer in Al Aqsa was a thousand times worth that elsewhere. Muslim
homes throughout the world had pictures of Al Aqsa.</P>

<P>Shaykh Bham told the conference that the rabbis of Vienna,
responding to Herzl's claim that Palestine was &quot;a land without
a people&quot;, sent two representatives there in 1897, who brought
back the message that &quot;the bride is beautiful, but she is
married to another husband&quot;. Shaykh Bham denounced Zionism
as racist nationalism that relied on religion to gain support.
He answered the slur that anti-Zionism was equivalent to anti-Semitism
or anti-Judaism by stating that Muslims recognized Judaism as
a divine revelation, and as to Arabs being Semites, anti-Semitism
was impossible for them, and Arabs were not blameworthy for the
crimes of the Nazis. At any rate, many Orthodox Jews opposed Zionism.
He bitterly denounced the &quot;peace process&quot;, since it
ignored Al Quds, presenting only the illusion of peace. Arafat's
PNA was only &quot;a small town Government&quot;, giving legitimacy
to the Apartheid-style situation. True peace, as in South Africa,
had to be founded on justice.</P>

<P>During the question period, with an emphasis on practical response,
a contribution from the audience to Yusuf Islam proposed that
Muslim communities boycott local tourist businesses offering holidays
in the Zionist entity, picketing them every Saturday until they
end such dealings, and reproducing such action against florists
selling imported Israeli flowers. This policy of economic sanctions,
based on the South African model, aimed at pressuring Israeli
businessmen to force the Zionist regime to abandon its practices.
Yusuf Islam said that this was a very practical suggestion. On
this point, Daud Abdullah stated that in breach of international
law, the EU imported goods from Jewish settlements in the Occupied
Territories, and so Muslims should lobby EU Governments against
this. </P>

<P>Azzam Tamimi urged Muslims to lobby Governments and the public
on the general issue of Palestine. Another contribution from the
floor urged the formation of local branches of Friends of Al Aqsa,
and Ismail Adam Patel, the Chairman of Friends of Al Aqsa, replied
that this was envisaged. Many contributors urged British Muslims
to visit Palestine on pilgrimage both to encourage their suffering
brothers and sisters and to emphasize that Al Aqsa is a Muslim
sanctuary. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Excesses On Palestinians: A Concern For Human Rights
Law</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B><I>Azim A. Khan Sherwani*</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Human rights are those minimal rights which every individual
must have against the State or other public authority by virtue
of his being a 'member of the human family', irrespective of any
other consideration.</P>

<P>The State of Israel was proclaimed on 15 May 1948; the day
after, the British announced their formal withdrawal from Palestine.
 At that time, Palestinians lost not only their sovereignty and
territory but also their status.  Thus, the Arab citizen of Palestine
till 1948 became Stateless refugees and were so recognized in
various resolutions of United Nations General Assembly.  In particular,
resolution 194 (III) emphasized upon their right to return or
to compensation.  Israel refused even to acknowledge resolution
242 of November 1967 (as well as resolution 338 of October 1973),
and it doesn't even mention Palestine or Palestinians as an issue.
 Art. 2 (I) of resolution 242 only mentions achieving the just
settlement of the refugee problem (not even of the Palestinian
refugee problem).  Thus, a Palestinian Diaspora was the result,
and 3.2 million Palestinians are waiting for the day when they
too can return to their homeland-an independent Arab State of
Palestine.</P>

<P>According to Professor K.R. Singh, Israel has effectively used
the policy of creating Jewish settlements in the occupied areas
as a means of establishing Israeli control over them as well as
a means of political bargaining.</P>

<P>These settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12
August 1949 that deals with the protection of civilian persons
in times of war.  The UN Security Council has several times criticized
Israel for violating the terms of that Convention. </P>

<P>Three years ago, an immigrant Jewish doctor from America, Baruch
Goldstein, directed an enfilade at a mass of praying Palestinians
at dawn during the holy month of Ramadan at a place of worship
in Hebron, regarded as sacred by both Arabs and Jews, and killed
at least 43 men.  The maniacal killer's grave has been turned
into a shrine by his admirers.  On New Year's Day in 1997, another
Zionist fanatic-and this time a regular soldier from the Israel
Defense Forces-Naom Friedman, sat on a Hebron street and opened
fire on a crowded Arab market.  Luckily, he failed to kill anyone
but was able to injure a few.  Goldstein, Friedman and Yigal Amir,
who murdered Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem, were all
convinced that they were acting under authority from their god
to prevent peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  This, of
course, is the lunatic fringe of Zionism. </P>

<P>In 1988 the Palestinian Parliament in exile dashed the national
demand to coexistence with Israel on the basis of UN resolutions.
 Arafat followed this up with a meek abjuration, &quot;totally
and absolutely&quot;, of &quot;all forms of terrorism, including
individual, group and State terrorism&quot;.   This amounted to
a tragic and humiliating admission by the Palestinian leader that
his people's struggle for freedom had been terrorism thus far;
he tried to look chastened before the Americans, earn their confidence
and with their good offices come to some settlement with the Israelis;
he was desperate for the proverbial half a loaf.</P>

<P>To quote Dr. P. Das Gupta &quot;whatever Chairman Arafat did
was powerless to get him anything.&quot;  Maverick Palestinian
bands at one end and Israel's agency for dirty tricks, Mossad,
at the other, could and did create incidents, which, without helping
the Palestinian cause in any way, were used to convince Washington
that the PLO Chairman either did not mean what he was saying or
was just not able to rein in &quot;Palestinian terrorism&quot;.
</P>

<P>Rabin confessed on Israel television that fighting the Arab
children had become the toughest challenge he had faced in his
long military career.  A few years later, a Tel Aviv Hebrew daily,
Al Hamishmar, frankly admitted that &quot;the intifadah was the
first war that Israel lost&quot;.  The &quot;children's revolution&quot;
drove home to the thinking section of Israeli politicians the
lesson that there were limits to keeping a whole people subjugated
by force and dispossessing them of their land.</P>

<P>It is surprising that though Article 7 of the International
Covenant of Civil and Political Rights prescribes that no one
shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment, these things are very common in Israel.
 </P>

<P>oreover, Articles 8-10 and 14 of the Covenant prescribes important
human rights standards concerning freedom from servitude, right
to liberty and security of persons, freedom from arbitrary arrest
and detention, right to trial within a reasonable time and pre-trial
release, and freedom from discrimination in the administration
of criminal justice have hardly received any attention in Israel
in the matter of victimized Palestinians.  There also exists the
standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners that provide
elaborated and detailed guidelines for the routine protection
of the rights of persons consigned to jail, whether by detention
or imprisonment.  But everyone knows what is happening in Israel-jails
are very crowded and Palestinians are kept in jail for longer
periods of time without any trial.  Custodial death and fake encounter
killings of Palestinians are very common.  Lethal weapons used
for mob control, even in ordinary, non-militant civilian situations,
is also very common.</P>

<P><B><I>Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
provides:</I></B><BR>
1.	Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence
within the borders of each State.<BR>
2.	Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his
own, and to return to his country.</P>

<P>In violation of the provisions, Palestinians are just like
captives, always at gunpoint under the Administration of Israel.
 They cannot move freely on their own land.</P>

<P><B><I>Article 55 (c)</I></B> of the United Nations Charter
provides, with a view to the creation of conditions of stability
and well-being, which are necessary for peaceful and friendly
relations among nations based on respect for the principle of
equal rights and self-determination of peoples, that it shall
promote:</P>

<P>Universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion.</P>

<P><B><I>Article 56 further declares :</I></B></P>

<P>All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action
in cooperation with the Organizations for the achievement of the
purposes set forth in Article 55.</P>

<P>Is it not true that after the establishment of the Palestinian
Government (Independent) there will be peace in West Asia as well
as in the world? On 22 November 1967, the Security Council passed
resolution 242 directing Israel to vacate the Palestinian area
occupied in war.  Almost 31 years have passed but the resolution
could not be honoured because of the dual policy of the &quot;big
five and the United Nations&quot;.  Encroachment of Iraq on Kuwait
was of the same nature but the Security Council, through its resolution
687, allowed America and the allies to use force against Iraq
under the garb of Articles 39, 40 and 41.</P>

<P>Is it not an example of State terrorism?  Is it not a problem
of human rights?  &quot;Civilized Nations&quot; are silent over
the issue.  If the World Community will keep silent regarding
human rights of the Palestinians, then definitely human rights
will merely remain rights on paper without any meaning or significance
for the millions of Palestinians.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The bleeding of a nation, Israeli violation of Palestinian
human rights</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>50 years after the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights</B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I>By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>To every people there are certain rights that are inherent,
inalienable and indivisible.  They are upheld and protected not
because of the generosity of any State or Government, but rather
because of the human condition of the people they refer to.  </P>

<P>Unlike other colonized peoples, the Palestinians have never
enjoyed nor exercised these rights throughout the twentieth century.
 Hence, instead of being an occasion to celebrate their achievements
as a free and independent people, the 50th. anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) has come only as
a bitter reminder of their continued dispossession, affliction
and suffering.</P>

<P>Following the carnage and slaughter of the Second World War,
the United Nations undertook the task of making human rights one
of its foremost concerns; avowedly with the aim of saving succeeding
generations from the scourge of war.  The preamble of its Charter
affirmed faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and
worth of the human person.  This concern has since proven to be
one of the most acute problems arising from what is known as the
&quot;Palestine Question&quot;, because ever since the UN decided
to partition their land into two States, Palestinians have always
maintained their opposition to the Zionist project precisely because
they were not consulted. </P>

<P>The creation of Israel in 1948 and the conflict which resulted
has provoked untold human rights abuses, both in terms of the
collective right of the Palestinian population to express itself
through the concept of the &quot;right of peoples to self-determination&quot;
or in terms of the individual human rights of the Palestinians.
 Yet, in order to fulfill their dream of making Israel a neo-Fascist
State, the Zionist occupiers drove the Palestinian inhabitants
from their homeland through a process of torture and persecution.
 <BR>
While the UDHR outlined ample provisions guaranteeing civil and
political rights, including the right to life and liberty, Israel
has flagrantly refused to conform to these international laws.
It has, on the contrary, become the only country in the world
that officially practices and justifies torture, in total violation
of the UN Charter and its conventions of human rights.</P>

<P><B><U>Detentions</U></B><BR>
Having learnt the practices of terror from their Gestapo tormentors,
the Zionists have today unleashed a reign of terror against their
Palestinian victims.  There are presently more than 2,400 Palestinian
and Arab prisoners held by Israel without charge or trial.  Another
1,200 are also held for illegally traveling beyond the Green Line,
while 60 others are held in administrative detention.  </P>

<P>Apart from conducting its own campaign of arbitrary arrest
and detention of Palestinians in the occupied territories, Israel,
with American help, exerted unparalleled pressure upon the Palestinian
Authority to arrest opponents of the Oslo accords, particularly
members and supporters of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS)
and Islamic Jihad.  The manner and scale of these arrests currently
taking place are clearly in total breach of Article 9 (1) of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),
which states that: &quot;Everyone has the right to liberty and
security of person.  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest
or detention.&quot;  </P>

<P><B><U>Torture</U></B><BR>
Once captured, Palestinian detainees are blindfolded and taken
to interrogation rooms where they are subjected to prolonged torture.
In most cases, they are assaulted in their private organs not
only because of the severe pain which this causes but also in
order to damage their reproductive systems and minimize signs
of physical abuse.  Other common forms of torture include: </P>

<P>Forcing prisoners to remain seated in tiny chairs for days,
violent shaking of the head which often results in death, prolonged
periods of sleep deprivation, exposure to extreme heat or cold,
depriving the detainees of access to a toilet, cigarette and electric
burns, severe beatings with hoses, cables and sticks, and placing
the head between the legs for many hours.  As a result of these
inhuman practices, 42 Palestinians died during interrogation in
1987 alone.  Since the Intifadah, 46 Palestinians died in detention,
17 of these died in prisons administered by the Israeli Prison
Services, 25 in detention centres run by the Israeli army and
4 others in dubious circumstances.</P>

<P>In addition to the above methods, Israeli interrogators often
resort to psychological terror such as threatening to kill prisoners,
to assault their wives, mothers or sisters, and threatening to
inject them with drugs that can cause madness or sterility.  Even
under these harrowing circumstances, prisoners are often denied
access to medical and legal consultation.</P>

<P><B><U>Violation of children's rights</U></B> <BR>
International human rights groups are unanimous on the fact that
1996 was one of the bloodiest in the history of Palestinian children.
 The Palestine branch of the International Movement for the Defence
of Children (IMDC) confirmed that that year 17 children were shot
to death by the Israeli military authorities and 8 others died
after they were denied medical treatment. </P>

<P>Throughout 1996, 109 Palestinian children were shot and wounded
by Israeli troops.  Most of them were wounded in the upper parts
of their bodies, particularly the head and chest-a clear indication
that the soldiers were following a shoot-to-kill policy.   Since
the signing of the Oslo accords, the rate of child detention has
increased beyond all expectation. At present there are about 250
Palestinian children under the age of 18 in Israeli prisons and
detention centres.</P>

<P>The effect of Zionist abuses upon these children have been
enormous and far-reaching.  Apart from their detention and interrogation,
many suffer injury in unprovoked attacks by Jewish settlers. Those
held in incarceration are denied the right to an education and
visits by relatives. Thousands more have been affected in one
way or another by the frequent closures of the territories. </P>

<P><B><U>Summary killings</U></B><BR>
Despite its claim to democracy and civility, Israel still does
not recognize the humanity of the Palestinian people. The cold-blooded
murder of Iyad Muhammad Awwad in 1996 in Qabalan village near
Nablus is an outstanding example of this fact and will never be
forgotten.  Forced by public pressure and outrage, the Israeli
courts reluctantly returned a verdict of homicide on four Jews
who proudly pleaded guilty of murdering the teenager.  To show
its utter contempt and disregard for Palestinian life, the court
ruled that each of the murderers should pay a fine of one Agora,
the equivalent to a third of a US cent.  This pattern of injustice
has been a permanent feature of the Israeli judicial system throughout
its history.  Four decades ago, a group of soldiers were similarly
fined one Qirsh after they massacred 49 villagers at Kufr Qasim.</P>

<P><B><U>Expulsion and the refugees</U></B><BR>
One of the worst violations of the UDHR concerns the 4.5 million
Palestinian refugees and their right to return.  Article 13 of
the Declaration explicitly states that; &quot;Everyone has the
right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to
his country.&quot;  After 50 years as Stateless refugees, the
Palestinians are still denied this fundamental right.  With no
travel documents except that provided by the UN, they remain the
targets and victims of systematic immigration harassment throughout
the Middle East and beyond. Meanwhile, the process of deportation
and expulsion from their homeland continues relentlessly. This
inhuman &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; is today most evident in
the holy city of Jerusalem, which Israel has declared as its eternal
capital after illegally annexing it through war.</P>

<P>Since the start of the occupation in 1967, an estimated 50,000
Palestinian Jerusalemites have been forced out of the city.  Of
this number, 12,080 were forced to leave due to lack of housing
in Jerusalem.  Despite their continuous residence in the city,
thousands of Palestinians have been forced to live on its peripheries
as a consequence of high rentals, exorbitant taxes, and severe
restrictions imposed by the Israelis on construction and family
reunions. Many of them were never issued with identity cards and
have, therefore, lost the right to return according to Israel's
draconian laws.</P>

<P><B><U>Behind the Green Line</U></B><BR>
The human rights conditions of the Palestinians living behind
the Green Line is no better than their counterparts elsewhere.
The recent disturbances in Um Fahem were, in every respect, an
expression of the growing frustration and determination of the
Palestinians there to preserve what is left of their national
heritage and identity.  Today there are at least 40 Palestinian
villages behind the Green Line that are not recognized by the
Zionist authorities.  As a result, their residents are denied
access to basic amenities such as water, health care and education.</P>

<P>Despite Israeli lip-service to the principle of peaceful coexistence,
institutionalized discrimination against Palestinian students
in Israeli schools and universities has reached epidemic proportions.
 Last year, over 1,200 Palestinians from northern Israeli towns
such as Galilee, Muthalath and the Nagev registered at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem.  Because of the discriminatory housing
policies imposed upon the city, they are forced to travel more
than 200 kilometres each day to and from the University in Jerusalem.
 The unparalleled power of the extremist right-wing and religious
groups within the Ministry of Education has, furthermore, led
to a well-established policy of demonizing Arabs and Palestinians
in Israeli schoolbooks and curricula.</P>

<P>In the area of health care, the government hospital in the
northern Israeli city of al Afoolah stands out prominently as
a bastion of discrimination.  While Hebrew medical pamphlets advertise
free services to Jewish patients, Arabic versions demand enormous
payments from Palestinian Arabs.  Last month, a Cesarean delivery
performed on a Palestinian woman from Galilee, Khadija Sawa'eed
(aged 34), became a major scandal at an Israeli hospital in Safad
city.  There, it was discovered that the Israeli doctors conducting
the operation had &quot;cut off the head of the infant&quot; while
attempting to take it out of the womb of its mother.  In order
to cover-up the crime, the doctors concerned stitched the head
back to the dead body, replaced it into the mother's womb and
informed relatives that the child had died as a result of difficulties
encountered during delivery. </P>

<P>Altogether, the above-mentioned crimes represent a mere fraction
of Israeli abuses and violations of Palestinian human rights.
Since the commencement of the so-called peace process, conditions
have become considerably worse within Israel, the Occupied West
Bank and Gaza, and the refugee camps abroad. </P>

<P>If a lasting peace is to be secured in this region, the international
community must ensure that the Rule of Law be established and
adhered to by all parties. Under no circumstances does military
might render exterminationist policies right. There are actually
no legal or moral reasons why Israel must be allowed to violate
international conventions through its insidious campaigns of ethnic
cleansing, terror and torture of Palestinians.  If, moreover,
a major catastrophe is to be averted in this region, the civilized
world must act swiftly and decisively to investigate and bring
to justice all those responsible for the summary executions, massacres,
aggressions and torture of Palestinians.  Without the immediate
and unconditional fulfillment of these measures, the ideals outlined
in the UDHR would remain empty slogans which betray both the weakness
and prejudice of its makers as well as their shared responsibility
in the crimes committed by Israel!!!</P>

<H3><CENTER>Just Telling A Story</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B><I>By E. Yaghi</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>I'm not complaining. Just telling a story.  It's really no
big deal as far as the atrocities Israeli soldiers commit.  In
fact, you might just call it a very minor infraction against humanity.</P>

<P>My story is not great.  My name is not important.  I'm an Israeli
citizen who has known the Bartat family for years.  I've spent
many a happy time eating and drinking with the family, and I've
been to their house more than once.  They're friends of mine.
 </P>

<P>I first met Sari when he was 7 years old at his brother's shop
in the Old City.  I've never seen such a sensitive kid.  Now Sari
is 12.  I just want to tell you how Israeli soldiers brutally
treat Palestinian kids.</P>

<P>The other day, Sari was standing on the roof of his house tending
his doves.  He lives near a small village in a place where Israeli
troops are still deployed.  At about 11 a.m., an IDF patrol was
cruising down the road.  The boy was spotted and perhaps, out
of sheer boredom, the patrol shouted at the boy to come down off
the roof.  It was a quiet morning in the village.</P>

<P> Let me make it clear that there were no riots, no burning
tires and no throwing of stones.  There were six soldiers.  As
soon as the boy came down from his roof, they started hitting
him with their rifle butts and shouting.</P>

<P>The boy's father, who is about 70 years old, came out and yelled,
&quot;Let the boy go!  He has done you no harm!&quot;</P>

<P>He too was hit with a rifle butt and one Israeli spit out the
words, &quot;Down, you dog!  Don't intervene or you will die!&quot;</P>

<P>Sari's aunt ran outside the house to stop the small brutal
infraction against humanity.  She screamed, &quot;Release the
boy!  Leave the old man alone!&quot;  </P>

<P>She was shoved around too and a few windowpanes were smashed.
 You know, &quot;to teach them a lesson.&quot;</P>

<P>The boy's hands and feet were tied and he was blindfolded.
 One soldier snarled at him, after he was thrown in the jeep,
&quot;Lie down.&quot;</P>

<P>The jeep took off, leaving the old man bleeding and crying
on the ground and the young aunt in a state of shock.  Next to
the boy was another passenger on the floor of the jeep.  He was
about 16 or 17 years old and he, too, was bound and bleeding,
just like Sari, just like his old father, just like his young
aunt.  Both boys were from the same village.  The jeep continued
along its way.</P>

<P>Sari was nudged with Israeli rifle barrels and ordered, &quot;Check
to see whether your companion is dead or alive.  You're a dirty
dog, too, and pretty soon you're going to die.  You have another
hour...another half an hour...a quarter of an hour.&quot; </P>

<P>His companion did not speak.  He did not move but Sari could
hear him breathing heavily. He could not see him because his blindfold
was still in place, but when he put his hand on the silent form,
he pulled it away quickly as clotted sticky blood clung to his
hand. The jeep moved along slowly until at last it pulled into
an army base with the prisoners.</P>

<P>In the meantime, Sari's older brother Maher arrived home with
his Norwegian wife and infant son.  He had just narrowly escaped
the wrath of an Israeli army patrol.  His car was stopped by an
Israeli patrol and one of the soldiers aimed his gun at the window
and cursed Maher's wife when she tried to open the car door. 
He kicked it shut but let Maher and his wife and son go.  </P>

<P>After arriving at his father's house, he went to search for
his younger brother.  At the local Israeli police station, he
was told, &quot;Beat it,&quot; and at a military compound, he
was told to come back at three, then at six and then he was told,
&quot;Get lost!&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, young Sari was in the brave custody of our Israeli
troops who had safely returned to base.  Miracles can still happen,
and I don't know how, but an officer intervened and told the soldiers
to release the boy.  They unbound his legs and took him over to
the road with his hands still tied, his eyes blindfolded and told
him, &quot;Listen kid, you're lucky to be alive. </P>

<P>You're lucky we didn't kill you.  Walk straight until you get
to your house.  Now get!&quot;</P>

<P>Sari started on his way, waiting a while until he dared to
take off the blindfold.  He did not know what happened to the
silent form that accompanied him on the floor of the jeep.  He
was too scared to think further.  Still a ways from home, he knocked
on the door of one of the villagers.  His wounds were tended to
and he washed up and had something to eat.  At sunset, around
6 p.m., he arrived home in a state of shock to his worried family
who were overjoyed to see him alive again.<BR>
Maher came and told me the story.  His father begged him not to
complain to the authorities fearing that Sari would be taken again
and might never return.  Of course, nothing will be gained by
complaining and after all, it isn't worthwhile and will only cause
more trouble.  Remember, I'm not complaining.  Not in the least.
 I'm just telling you a story about this minor infraction against
humanity because of my shame.</P>

<P>The physical wounds Sari received from his savage beating will
heal.  But, as I said earlier, I've never seen such a sensitive
kid. What I keep wondering is how the wounds growing in his soul
will ever go away.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Beit Iqsa Knows Its Enemy</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ramzy Baroud</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Sunday, 18 November is with no doubt a day to remember for
160 Palestinian students from the village of Beit Iqsa. Beit Iqsa,
a small village that lies on the shoulder of a beautiful mountain
near Jerusalem, woke up last Sunday to receive horrifying news.
The disturbing report was the arrest and beating of two Palestinian
busloads of children from the village of Beit Iqsa.</P>

<P>While the buses were in their way to the town of Al-Jib, a
group of well-armed Israeli soldiers, joined by settlers and dogs,
stopped the school buses, claiming that the children, ages 12-16,
may be carrying explosives in their schoolbags. The young students
were literally horrified, even though the scene is somewhat familiar.
Since the village unluckily lies in Area B (the shared controlled
area according to the Oslo Agreement's division of the Occupied
West Bank and Gaza), the residents of Beit Iqsa have been an easy
target for the Israeli soldiers and the settlers of &quot;Ramut&quot;.</P>

<P>Taisir Ajaj, a member in the village local municipality, explained
to reporters, &quot;Beit Iqsa and surrounding villages have been
receiving systematic harassment from the Israeli occupation forces.
They simply want us to pack our possessions and leave our villages
so that their settlements could expand&quot;. In fact, the village
of Beit Iqsa, which is a mere example of almost all the towns
and villages around Jerusalem, has lost most of its land to the
ever-expanding Israeli settlements such as Ramut.</P>

<P>That morning, however, the soldiers' techniques were unexpected.
The normally quiet village of Beit Iqsa lived through a very frightening
experience that will remain in its memory as long as &quot;Ramut&quot;
allows it to exist.</P>

<P>After the two buses were stopped, the 160 students were all
force to lie on the ground as each one was searched. Their schoolbags
and lunch boxes were opened to be scattered on the ground for
the dogs to sniff search.</P>

<P>The moment the astonished children thought the nightmare was
over, the soldiers ordered one of the two buses to drive into
the Israeli settlement of Ramut, with all of the little girls
aboard. When the boys protested the action, five of them were
viciously beaten and later arrested. Two of the young boys were
brothers, one was age 13 and the other 14.</P>

<P>Once the buses reached Ramut, each and every child went through
a one-on-one interrogation with Israeli Secret Agency Personnel.
The kids were asked about their activities and whether they were
involved with any militant organizations. They were told that
they may be hiding explosives in their schoolbags to kill Israelis
in Jerusalem.</P>

<P><BR>
The students' terrified families gathered around an Israeli checkpoint,
which blocked the main road of the village, and pleaded for an
explanation. It was all explained to the crying parents with a
shower of tear gas and sound bombs. It was the typical way Israel
resolves conflicts, by flexing its muscles over those who cannot
defend themselves.</P>

<P>Instead of being in school, receiving food for the mind, the
students of Beit Iqsa were forced to make an unforgettable field
trip. After 8 hours of abusive and savage lessons in the &quot;school
of Ramut&quot;, conferred by unmerciful teachers (the Israeli
soldiers, that is), the students of Beit Iqsa returned home. It
was an indescribable scene when the whole village went to embrace
its small champions who had come home. </P>

<P>The tears from gas bombs were mixed with tears of relief when
the children arrived.  Perhaps the families of Beit Iqsa thought
that their youth had lost a whole day of school on that sad morning.
However, the most important lesson of their lives was presented
to them that day. Lao Tzu expanded on this lesson thousands of
years ago in his philosophical volume, &quot;The Art of War&quot;.</P>

<P>That valuable message was, &quot;know your enemies&quot;. A
few hours after the children were safe at home, the main road
leading to the village was completely empty, except for 4 mothers,
patiently waiting for their beloved ones to appear. Mutaz, Ashraf,
Sharif, Faiz, and Munder never arrived at the end of the day.
The five young boys were arrested for protesting the abuse. And
while the mothers still wait, Beit Iqsa and many other towns and
villages are waiting for their fate to be determined, to stay
or to go.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Pollard-Wye Fiasco: A Blow to the Jewish Right</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B><I>By Muna Salman (<A HREF="muna_salman@alif.com">muna_salman@alif.com</A>)</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>One of the less-known but equally significant outcomes of the
Wye accord has been the rift created overnight between the Jewish
right and the Republicans over the Jonathan Pollard affair on
the eve of the 1998 elections. </P>

<P>Somewhere in early October, news of Pollard's imminent release
was circulating. The Clinton administration was floating trial
balloons for some time to gauge the media reaction to such a move.
According to sources in both Netanyahu's and Clinton's administrations,
Jonathan Pollard was supposed to receive a pardon a few weeks
after the signing of the Wye Memorandum.</P>

<P><BR>
Brimming with confidence, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu &quot;leaked&quot;
to the press Clinton's intentions to review Jonathan Pollard's
case and eventually pardon the spy. Shortly after this revelation,
an avalanche of phone calls, faxes and letters flooded the White
House communications centres, as well as Congress, calling for
the rejection of any review or pardon. </P>

<P>With quiet diplomacy eliminated, the Clinton administration
was left with no choice but to retract in the face of mounting
public outrage. That was not the end of the Pollard-Wye affair.
</P>

<P>The outcry was so enormous against the release of Pollard,
even right-wing Republicans called upon the president to reject
the notion of a review. Putting the administration on the spot
did not endear Netanyahu to key Clinton advisors, who saw it as
political blackmail at the eleventh hour of the Wye negotiations.
</P>

<P>Even when aggressively courting the Jewish vote, the Republicans
knew where to draw the line. Jewish votes and financial support
are highly coveted but not at the expense of the mainstream vote
that views Jonathan Pollard as a pariah that needs to be punished
for his treason. </P>

<P>As a spy for Israel, Pollard leaked secret U.S. satellite images,
including those of the Palestine National Council complex in Tunis.
The photos enabled Israeli warplanes to violate Tunisian airspace
and bomb PNC headquarters in a 1985 raid that resulted in numerous
Palestinian and Tunisian civilian deaths. </P>

<P>The classified documents Pollard handed to the Israelis included
sensitive data on American intelligence networks in the Middle
East. This effectively put every U.S. operative in the Middle
East, including Arab operatives, at the mercy of Israel. </P>

<P>Together, CIA mole Aldridge Ames and American spy Jonathan
Pollard debacles have severely undermined U.S. intelligence efforts
at recruiting operatives around the world and have exposed U.S.
intelligence assets to danger. To the underground world, no covert
operation will be secure in the hands of U.S. intelligence bureaucrats.
In Pollard's case, no one knows the extent of the damage yet,
but it was described as incalculable by U.S. intelligence experts.</P>

<P>Political pressure by the Jewish right was applied to stop
or contain the release of such damage reports in an effort to
win Pollard's release. To muddy the waters on the legal front,
Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship by Netanyahu in 1996,
hoping to win his release as a foreign spy instead of his current
status as an American traitor. </P>

<P>Jewish political leaders have relentlessly lobbied successive
U.S. administrations for Pollard's release to no avail. The political
risks are too high for any American official to undertake this
unprecedented step and pardon a U.S. spy. Few wish to go down
in U.S. history on Pollard's account. </P>

<P>So serious is Pollard's breach of national security that even
Newt Gingrich, a darling of the Jewish right, dubbed Jonathan
Pollard the most dangerous traitor in American history. Then-State
Secretary Caspar Weinberger described the damage caused by Pollard
as the greatest the U.S. ever suffered. </P>

<P>But in reality, the greatest damage to U.S. national security
was dealt by American spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and Morris
and Lona Cohen, who sold U.S. nuclear technology to the Soviets
in the 1950s. Shortly thereafter, the USSR detonated their first
atomic bomb followed by a hydrogen bomb, breaking the American
monopoly on nuclear armament and setting in motion the dynamics
of the Cold War. </P>

<P>Pollard, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer was later
apprehended by U.S. authorities in 1985 as he rushed to the entrance
of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. His former wife was
also arrested for being an accessory. He has been serving a life
sentence since 1987, when he was convicted on charges of treason
and espionage for passing sensitive U.S. information to a foreign
Government. Pollard is currently serving his life sentence in
federal prison in Butner, North Carolina. </P>

<P>Sources close to the Pollard investigation left little doubt
as to the dire consequences of releasing the U.S. spy to the Israelis.
They insist, even after his release, Pollard can undoubtedly cause
severe damage to U.S. national security given what he knows and
who he knows. </P>

<P>While Netanyahu's impertinence is to blame for the administration's
swift rejection for a pardon, Jewish leaders saw the Republicans
undermine whatever chances they had in winning Pollard's release.
With Gingrich leading the pack against any review or pardon, Jewish
leaders were disillusioned at their abandonment by the Republicans
whom they thought would jump at the opportunity to win Jewish
votes in an election season. </P>

<P>The Republicans proved conventional wisdom wrong in no uncertain
terms. Embracing Pollard would have been political suicide in
the 1998 elections. Both parties have decided it's safer to sacrifice
the Jewish vote in 1998 than to alienate the mainstream vote.
Instead of a partisan race to win Pollard's release as the Israelis
hoped for, both parties were racing to condemn any such move.
The shock of rejection and its aftermath still reverberates in
the Jewish American community. </P>

<P>The Pollard-Wye faux pas has undoubtedly left a bitter taste
for the Jewish American community. It fed into their concerns
that all politics are local and transient. Winning Pollard's release
has been a central issue for the Jewish community in the U.S.
And after the wave of negative publicity, it seems less tenable
than ever for an American administration to stick its neck out
for a spy, let alone one of Pollard's calibre.</P>

<P>In the aftermath of the Pollard affair, many Jewish American
leaders have been exposed to troublesome questions of loyalty.
Admittedly, it is rare for loyal citizens of a country to campaign
for the release of a traitor. It was also a reality check for
mainstream Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, as to the
political perils of unconditional support for Israel at the expense
of U.S. security. </P>

<P>The failed bid to release the Jewish spy has led the Jewish
American leadership to reevaluate its presuppositions as to how
far it can or should go in twisting arms. Some Jewish Americans
have expressed concern at what they consider a reckless and misguided
attempt to channel Jewish American clout in full view of the American
public in a bid to win the release of what most Americans legitimately
consider a traitor. </P>

<P>After decades of success at yanking the U.S. out of international
consensus on issues pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict, often
at a great cost to U.S. stature and interests, the sense of overconfidence
led right-wing Jewish leaders to assume they can wield similar
influence over the release of an American traitor such as Pollard.
They were proven wrong. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Making Sense out of Nonsense</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B><I>By Ibrahim Alloush*</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>Eight Years of Nonsense: Because eight years of strict Iraqi
compliance with explicitly U.S./U.K (implicitly &quot;Israeli&quot;)
weapons inspections would have probably been more than enough
to disarm a whole continent, and because it has become blatantly
obvious that the harsh sanctions on the Iraqi people and State
are not going to be lifted anytime soon-no matter what Iraq does
or does not do short of becoming another Arab client regime that
lets the CIA run domestic security like Arafat conceded in Wye-there
had to come a point when Iraq sovereignly declares &quot;ENOUGH
IS ENOUGH&quot;.</P>

<P>Then the recent Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 initiated by the
U.S. Congress mandating direct and overt U.S. Government involvement
in the overthrow of the present Iraqi regime confirmed beyond
a reasonable doubt the point that both the sanctions and the war
on Iraq sought all along to contain Iraq's strength and regional
political role, regardless of the identity of the rulers. For
Iraq has long been out of Kuwait, and has had moreover to endure
the most comprehensive weapons elimination programme in modern
times, unlike &quot;Israel&quot; and many other States with more
serious weapons of mass destruction than Iraq's. In the meantime,
murderous sanctions continue to detrimentally erode Iraq's military
and economic infrastructure and to reap hundreds of thousands
of the very Iraqi people whose welfare and human rights the U.S.
administration claims hypocritically to be concerned for. </P>

<P>Old Policies, New Victims: These practices, however, make sense
from the point of view of the neo-colonial interests the U.S.
Government represents or the viewpoint of &quot;Israel&quot;:
to try to destroy Iraq as a regional power, to strengthen the
hold of the U.S. on the oil-rich countries of the Arab Gulf and
to keep the Arabs weak in negotiations with &quot;Israel&quot;,
or to try to preempt Iraq as a potential base for Arab unity,
is consistent with Western policies in the region ever since the
name of the Arab world became the misnomer &quot;Middle East&quot;.
Thus to destroy Iraq's strategic defense capabilities, scientific
and economic installations, social fabric, bridges, highways,
oil installations, factories, people, civil society, and State
is consistent with colonial and Zionist objectives in the region
as suggested many times before. </P>

<P>The Real Nonsense: What is neither rational nor logical, however,
is the recent statement by the foreign ministers of the eight
Arab States of the so-called Damascus Declaration warning Iraq
to resume cooperation with the United Nations and indicating that
Iraq &quot;must bear responsibility for triggering the current
crisis&quot;. Forget Arab unity and forget Islamic brotherhood!
To take such a flimsy position in the midst of the current crisis
is not only wrong and contrite, but runs contrary to one's own
best interests.</P>

<P>Only recently Syria was very much under threat from the north
(and the south) with the blessings of Washington and Tel Aviv.
A more logical move would have been to open up more eastward on
Iraq. Then the Wye Plantation security deal came to marginalize
large Arab States like Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia in the same
capacity as it enlisted some Palestinians to protect &quot;Israeli&quot;
security. The Jordanian economy is reeling from enforcing sanctions
on Iraq. The U.S.-&quot;Israeli&quot; policy of meddling in the
internal affairs of Egypt under the pretext of helping the Coptic
minority and &quot;religious freedom&quot; has become as brazen
as the attempt to stir up religious and ethnic strife in Iraq
under the pretext of &quot;helping the rights&quot; of the Kurds
and the Shiites!! <BR>
Forget right and wrong. Forget brotherhood. Forget eight years
of compliance with UNSCOM that did not bear fruit. Forget the
suffering of the Iraqi people. Forget the fact that enforcing
the siege on Iraq became the stepping stone and the historical
precedent for more sanctions on other Arab States such as Libya
and Sudan. Forget the joint U.S.-&quot;Israeli&quot; naval exercises
along the Syrian shore and the strategic alliance between the
U.S. and &quot;Israel&quot;. Moreover, forget Palestine and forget
Iraq. </P>

<P>orget all that and much more. The simple question is: can ruling
Arab bastards, who tend to get quite fierce with their own people,
at least dare to defend their own best interests? Can they at
least protect themselves as even animals instinctively do in the
wild?</P>

<P>Blame Arab Division, not Arab Unity: But in fact there is a
rational, albeit a totally short-sighted, streak in the motives
of Arab and Islamic States implementing the siege: they all mostly
follow a weaken-thy-neighbor policy. Most of them covet the roles
that Iraq under any leadership would emerge to play when and if
the siege is lifted. So, as rulers of their midget States, they
have been set up from the start by Syckes and Picot, the drafters
of the colonial map of Arab division, to go at each others' throats
in their own midget ways in this world of giants. Therefore, the
root of our problems lies, in fact, in the bitter reality of Arab
division, not in the dream or hope of Arab unity as some have
recently claimed. Arab division is to blame for the continuation
of sanctions on Iraq, Libya and Sudan, and the general worsening
conditions of Arabs. Arab unity is consequently the solution to
that problem. Understanding the problem this way immediately poses
the unabashed political need of mass Arab uprisings to overthrow
at least a couple of dictatorial Arab puppets to make room for
any progress in any direction within the foreseeable future. Understanding
the problem this way also justifies the need to achieve our unity
by hook or by crook, the same way Abraham Lincoln or Bismarck
maintained or achieved the unity of the United States of America
and Germany, respectively, by hook or by crook.</P>

<H3><CENTER>&quot;To Strike Or Not To Strike, That Is The Question&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B><I>By Fatima Hamilton</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>We now have the reckless, ruthless American cowboy ready to
ambush and crush an already crippled and pitiful Iraq.  How much
more destruction does the U.S. want to cause the suffering population
of Iraq?  Why do they insist on a showdown?  </P>

<P>hese arms inspections and their battling to check every nook
and corner of Iraq for what appears to be fairy tale weapons is
becoming a boring subject.  When will this thing finish?  We have
the U.S. on one side wanting to battle, for crazy reasons, while
the rest of the world prefers a diplomatic solution.  Which is
better and more effective? </P>

<P>Well, brute force never has solved anything; it causes more
death and destruction.  However, America is ready to flex its
muscles and to show off its power to the world.  It wants everyone
to know that it cannot be defied.  Also, they must be having some
economic woes, so to spice up their economy they would not mind
a small war.  War helped the Americans out of the Great Depression
when they joined the allies in the Second World War.  Factories
produced and people worked, so their economy improved.  This battle
is not for principles and humanity.  It is the selfish war of
an Imperialist. </P>

<P>The American Government convinces its public that they must
strike Iraq before Iraq strikes someone else.  They brainwash
them into supporting an unjust cause through their slick political
language.  These poor Americans are politically na&iuml;ve, in
general.  They really have no true idea of the situation in the
Middle East.  Many have never even been outside of their own country.
 So, they follow the media and believe everything.  Thus, they
are herded together to support something, a war, that they don't
even know really why they're supporting it.  </P>

<P>While searching the Internet, I found a CNN discussion group
that was discussing what should be done about Iraq.  One participant
stated that the U.S. should bombard Iraq with missiles in order
to take out Saddam.  Does he really think that this will get rid
of Saddam?  It didn't work the last time.  Innocent children,
women, elderly and the rest of the innocent population are suffering
under poverty, disease and bad living conditions that resulted
from the last strikes the U.S. rained upon Iraq. </P>

<P>Well, the American Government is not bent on ridding the world
from Saddam nor is it ready to lend a humanitarian hand to people
in the world, otherwise it would lift the sanctions from Iraq
and ease the people's horrible situation.  No, America wants to
destroy all of Iraq and to crush its people.  This is their plan
if they can rally world support and make the United Nations bow
to its wishes.  They are playing political games to help its small
ally in the Middle East, its &quot;Mother&quot; country.  All
Americans should ask themselves, what will war achieve for us,
and is Saddam a danger to America?  Of course, the answer is &quot;no.&quot;
 His missiles, if he even has any left, cannot reach America.
</P>

<P><BR>
One must ponder how slow the UN is in working.  Are they lazy?
 How long does it take to find weapons of mass destruction?  They've
been in Iraq for years and discovered very little.  There is nothing
left to discover.  They should just pack their bags, go home and
quit trying to build imaginary weapons in the air.  Also, America
should abide by UN rules and quit sending its spies to gather
information on Iraq.  Iraq is still a country and has a right
to national security.  If anyone has escalated this problem and
endangered a peaceful solution, it is the U.S.  They are provoking
Iraq. </P>

<P><BR>
The rest of the world, in general, wants a diplomatic solution.
 They are not desirous to fight and cause destruction.  They are
more humanitarian.  They are willing to sit down and reason. 
Always America takes the rude, aggressive role while Europe takes
a sophisticated, negotiating role.  Negotiation can reach more
lasting results.  This time, Arab countries will not support an
unjustified mission against Iraq.  Striking Iraq can cause instability
in the region.  Most of the world realizes this.  Maybe America
wants this.  However, this instability would not be in its own
best interests, if they only knew.  </P>

<P>The Arab countries have suffered economically because of the
Gulf war.  Jordan had taken in people fleeing from Kuwait, and
they are taking in many Iraqis who are looking for work to support
their families; this puts a drain on Jordan.  The economies of
the Arab countries are at a low.  They are anxious to start business
ventures and trade with Iraq.  Everyone wants to look for the
future.  Humans all over the world have the basic right to food,
a home, clothes, medical care and education.  So, why are so many
denied this right just because they live in the Third World? 
Aren't they humans, too? </P>

<P>So, a diplomatic solution needs to be reached.  Saddam says
they can't inspect further until they lift the sanctions.  It
seems only fair.  They've inspected enough and the people have
suffered enough.  The humanitarians of the world must support
lifting the sanctions and allowing the people their freedom of
&quot;the pursuit of happiness and liberty,&quot; something Americans
take for granted.  <BR>
There are voices in the world that speak for the lifting of sanctions
and are against military action.  Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds visited Iraq and witnessed the terrible conditions
the people were living under.  He stated that &quot;If U.S. and
British leaders visited sanctions-hit Iraqi hospitals and saw
that children were dying, they would not consider any military
strike&quot; (Jordan Times, 10 November 1998). </P>

<P>A UNICEF report states that &quot;4,500 children under the
age of five die of starvation and disease each month and nearly
one million children are at risk of acute malnutrition as a result
of economic sanctions.&quot;  </P>

<P>Where is the heart and conscience of America?  Why do they
want to kill and harm children?  Why do they want the U.S. to
strike an already crippled and devastated country, which has already
been brought to its knees?  They are selfish and do not care about
the rest of the world as long as they get their oil and keep other
countries beneath them.  They live in cozy homes and have delicious
food without a thought for starving children and people in Iraq.
 Is this justice??</P>

<H3><CENTER>From Tears To Terror</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B><I>By Ruth Anderson</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I>&quot;Truth does not have a color and<BR>
Justice does not have a name...&quot;<BR>
<B>Dr. Martin Luther King</B></I></CENTER></P>

<P>In August of this year, a tearful President Bill Clinton confessed
to millions of American viewers of his &quot;inappropriate&quot;
relationship with former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
 Now, nearly three months later, the same man who pleaded for
mercy and understanding from his own people suddenly has had little
to spare for the plight of millions of Iraqis.</P>

<P><BR>
In the recent showdown between the U.S. and Iraq, few Americans,
especially those in key Government positions, have seriously taken
into consideration the reasons the Iraqi ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoun, told the BBC on 3 November of his country's
decision to block cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors.
 Mr. Hamdoun told the BBC that the decision to block UNSCOM (the
UN Special Commission) was in protest of the effects of the sanctions.
 &quot;Iraq has taken its decision out of frustration and because
of the continuous and needless deaths that we are suffering through.
Over 6,000 children a month are dying because of the impact of
the sanctions,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>In his &quot;Letter from Birmingham City Jail&quot;, when he
was imprisoned for demonstrating for civil rights, Dr. Martin
Luther King argued that individuals had the moral right and responsibility
to disobey unjust laws.  Nizar Hamdoun's announcement to the BBC
of the Iraqi decision to block UN inspectors was his moral right
and responsibility.</P>

<P>Though the threat of a U.S. military strike is now not so imminent,
U.S. officials seem to be nevertheless without moral conscience
or ethics of any kind.  When asked whether the price of toppling
the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was worth sacrificing half
a million Iraqi children, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
answered, &quot;Yes, we think the price is worth it.&quot;</P>

<P>There is no guarantee that any kind of military strike against
Iraq, if taken, whether swift and surgical or intense and prolonged,
would effectively remove Saddam Hussein from power.  There is
also no guarantee that the collective punishment of the Iraqi
people and the destruction of their financial, political and military
infrastructure would in turn force them into overthrowing Saddam's
regime.</P>

<P>President Bill has been weakened considerably by his sex scandals.
The accusations meted out by many Republican politicians for his
indecisiveness and ambivalence regarding the use of force against
Baghdad and Zionist organizations along with the Jewish lobby
have all been pushing hard for a military strike against Iraq.
 For these reasons, it would prove expedient for Clinton to unleash
heavy and devastating air strikes against Iraq.</P>

<P>It is hard to believe that the same man who shed tears for
his own immoral behaviour could have no mercy for the innocent
victims of the heavy bombardment he may be planning to unleash.
 But then, such a massive and cruel bombardment would surely improve
his image and let Americans forget, at least momentarily, the
lack of their leader's morals in a country that has no idea what
morals are anyway.</P>

<P>War is the greatest form of terror.  The innocent die and quite
often, the guilty live.  The repercussions in the event of any
armed attack would be unfathomable but the greatest toll of all
would not be the fall of the innocent and helpless, but the ultimate
loss of the American conscience.</P>

<P>Truth knows no color.  All people all over the world have the
right to live decent and peaceful lives and to pursue a career
or profession that will sustain them.  Justice has no name.  To
continue the sanctions is not only unjust, but also inhuman, but
to bomb and further collectively punish the Iraqi people is monstrous.
 Though the threat of an imminent military strike has now faded
for the time being, how long can the Iraqis continue to go on
under the sanctions?   </P>

<P>Meanwhile, more than 130 U.S. military aircraft and some 21,500
troops have been ordered to the Gulf.  This makes a total deployment
of some 44,000 soldiers.  The military buildup and the heavy toll
the sanctions have been taking add up to a time-bomb ready to
explode.</P>

<P>When her husband divorced her two years ago to marry another
woman, Basma felt utterly lost.  Her husband kept their four children
with him and sent her away.  Basma had no other choice but to
go back to live with her parents. </P>

<P>Like many women at Jebel el-Hussein camp in Amman, Basma had
left school at an early age and had not acquired any skills to
use for earning an income.</P>

<P>&quot;When she first visited the Legal Advice Bureau (LAB)
in the camp, Basma was in a state of despair&quot;, says Randa
Halaweh, UNRWA's Women's Programme Officer in Jordan.  The lawyer
who works at the Bureau as a volunteer explained to Basma her
rights: that she has the right of custody over her children, and
the right to receive alimony for her and the children.</P>

<P>With financial and professional support from LAB, Basma eventually
filed a court case against her husband and obtained a verdict
obliging him to pay her alimony of JD 90 a month and to give up
custody of the children for her.</P>

<P>Basma is one of hundreds of women who benefited from the Legal
Advice Bureau since it was set up by UNRWA in Jebel el-Hussein
camp in 1995.  It was the second in Jordan after a similar centre
had been opened in Wihdat camp in Amman in 1994.</P>

<P>The two centres were opened after a series of legal literacy
courses had been conducted at several women's programme centres
in Jordan.  The courses revealed that there was a dire need to
raise women's awareness of their rights and to provide them with
legal counseling.</P>

<P>Basma attended a sewing course at the women's centre in the
camp. She is now working for a clothes factory in Amman, which
earns her JD 100 a month.  With the alimony she receives from
her ex-husband, she is now able to sustain a living for herself
and her children.</P>

<P>Basma is now looking for a house to rent so that she can live
independently with her children.</P>

<P>&quot;Empowering women with knowledge, enabling them to acquire
the skills to earn a living and facilitate their role in their
communities have been the centrepiece of UNRWA's work with women
over the last few years&quot;, explains Fuad Shawwa, Chief of
Relief and Social Services Programme of UNRWA in Jordan.  The
21 women's centres established by UNRWA in Jordan offer a wide
range of courses such as computer, business skills, civic education
and household maintenance, in addition to traditional courses
such as sewing, machine-knitting and hairdressing.  &quot;Our
aim is to prepare women for income-earning opportunities and enhance
their role in community development&quot;, says Mr. Shawwa.</P>

<P>Community savings and loan groups were set up in Wihdat, Jebel
el-Hussein, Marka, Zarqa and Jerash camps to provide loans to
members, mainly women, from a revolving fund.  The fund was established
in 1996 with the women's own pooled savings and external funding
to assist them in starting up their own businesses.  At the Jerash
WPC, about 70 women earn an income through a wool-spinning enterprise,
and 20 women in Jebel el-Hussein camp earn a living through a
food production unit.</P>

<P>&quot;All of this is part of our poverty alleviation strategy
that targets the poorest of the refugees, in particular those
registered with UNRWA as special hardship cases&quot;, says Mr.
Shawwa.  At the centre of this endeavour is the income-generation
loan programme. Launched in Jordan in 1991 with a starting capital
of $500,000, the programme has now a loan capital base of about
$830,000. It has financed 146 enterprises and has created over
350 jobs. </P>

<P>Job creation goes hand in hand with the training programmes
UNRWA provides for the children of Palestine refugees in Jordan
at Amman and Wadi-Seer training centres.</P>

<P>The training courses offered at the two centres are kept under
constant revision to ensure that the trainees are trained in marketable
skills. &quot;It is with this purpose in mind that we introduced
the industrial electronics course in Wadi Seer Training Centre
(WSTC) in 1993&quot;, says Omar Ghabayen, Chief of UNRWA's Education
Programme in Jordan. The WSTC also offers semi-professional courses
in architectural and civil engineering, land surveying and mechanical
drafting, as well as vocational training in mechanical, electrical
and building trades.</P>

<P>UNRWA's other training centre in Jordan, the Amman Training
Centre, prepares men and women at the post-secondary level for
jobs as assistant pharmacists, laboratory technicians and business
administrators. &quot;Over the last few years, we've added new
courses in banking and financial management, medical record-keeping
and secretarial skills&quot;, explains Mr. Ghabayen. &quot;It's
very rewarding to see that the trainees of both centres are offered
work at the businesses and industries where they do their on-the-job
training&quot;, he pointed out.</P>

<P>In addition to training, UNRWA offers 10 years of basic education
for over 141,000 boys and girls studying at 198 schools in Jordan.
According to Mr. Ghabayen, a major achievement in the education
programme has been to replace all dilapidated prefabricated premises
with standard UNRWA school buildings. &quot;But we still have
a number of unsuitable rented premises that are badly in need
of replacement&quot;, he added. In the last three years, thanks
to special contributions from the donors, two school buildings
were opened in Baqa'a camp, two in Marka (Hittin) camp and one
in Sukhneh near Zarqa.  Two buildings are now under construction
in Irbid camp. &quot;Needles to say&quot;, Mr. Ghabayen adds,
&quot;improved facilities means better education services&quot;.
</P>

<P>Fully equipped computer laboratories, library rooms, science
labs and multi-purpose activity facilities were installed in all
new schools.</P>

<P>&quot;But our biggest achievement has been to provide a quality
education to several generations of refugees to enable them to
become productive members of society&quot;, says Mr. Ghabayen.
</P>

<P>In Baqa'a and Wihdat camps, UNRWA runs two centres for children
with learning difficulties.  Pupils in the first four grades who
cannot catch up with the level of their classmates in mathematics
and Arabic are referred to these centres where they receive special
care in an encouraging educational environment. Raja' Omar, supervisor
of these centres and the other six centres UNRWA opened in other
areas in Jordan, says that children come to the centre for two
or three hours a day, but they spend the rest of the day at their
original classes to study their other subjects.  &quot;These centres
may best be described as &quot;educational clinics&quot; where
we take remedial action to enable the children to cope with their
colleagues&quot;, says Ms. Omar.</P>

<P>In the playground of UNRWA school in Mashare' in the Jordan
Valley, 10-year-old Mahmoud is talking to a friend in sign language.
He picked it up from hearing-impaired schoolmates who had been
recently integrated into the general education programme.  These
hearing-impaired children receive special education in a special
unit in the school; but they participate with their peers in art
and sports activities and spend breaks with schoolmates. Similar
units have also been established in UNRWA schools in Baqa'a, Souf
and Irbid camps. The units are run under the supervision of the
local community-based rehabilitation centres, each in their camp.
 In Jordan, UNRWA supports eight rehabilitation centres to cater
for children with special needs in recognition of their right
to be enabled to become equal and productive members of their
communities.</P>

<P>The welfare of refugee mothers and children is the major emphasis
of UNRWA's health programme.  By the turn of the century, two
thirds of refugees will consist of women of reproductive age and
children below the age of 15. &quot;Recognizing this fact, the
Agency has put the stress on family health in its regular health
care programme&quot;, explains Dr. Nasha't Ammari, Chief of UNRWA
Health Programme in Jordan.  UNRWA's 24 health centres and points
in Jordan provide mother and child health services, including
family planning as well as antenatal, natal and post-natal care.
As part of the programme, Dr. Ammari points out, supplementary
nutrition assistance is provided to pregnant women and nursing
mothers.  All these services are integrated into the Agency's
primary health care programme, which also includes medical care
services, both preventive and curative, and environmental health
services in camps.</P>

<P>Like in education, UNRWA has been able to improve the quality
of its health facilities by replacing prefabricated premises with
modern concrete health centres, which have had a positive impact
on the quality of health services to the refugees. </P>

<P>&quot;As a result of the strides we have made in improving
the health of the refugees, and since healthier people live longer,
our programme has had to face new challenges&quot;, says Dr. Ammari.
 &quot;Today's challenges are those of a community in transition.
We are now having to cope with an increasing frequency of problems,
which are more typical of industrialized countries, such as heart
diseases, hypertension and diabetes. These are lifestyle diseases.
 In response to this, the Agency has added a non-communicable
diseases programme, which includes specialized clinics for diabetes
and hypertension in all health centres and health points in Jordan&quot;,
he explains.</P>

<P>&quot;Perhaps the greatest success of the health programme
is a hidden one, a persistence against the odds&quot;, says Dr.
Ammari.  UNRWA's health care has continued to improve amid an
almost endless number of increasing complications. The number
of patients receiving treatment continues to increase. This contrasts
with a background of limited resources and an economic decline
the Palestine refugee population had to face in recent years.</P>

<P>In providing its education, health, relief and social services
to the Palestine refugees, UNRWA has been fulfilling the mandate
given to it in 1949 by the United Nations General Assembly; that
is to provide humanitarian assistance to the Palestine refugees
until a settlement is reached to the refugee problem.  &quot;Our
mandate is largely based on the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations on 10 December
1948, particularly articles 25 and 26&quot;, says Gunnar Lofberg,
the Director of UNRWA Operations in Jordan.  Article 25 provides
that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for
the health and well-being of himself, including food, medical
care and social services and the right to security in event of
sickness and disability.  Article 26 says that everyone has the
right to free education as well as to technical and professional
education on the basis of merit.  &quot;This is exactly what we
have been trying to ensure for the Palestine refugees over almost
five decades&quot;, Mr. Lofberg pointed out.</P>

<P>However, since the early 1990s, UNRWA has had to work under
adverse conditions and budgetary deficits.  It has been able to
survive, thanks to the generous support of its donors, the host
countries and the dedication of its staff.  &quot;Financial crises
are not new to UNRWA, but rarely has it faced a financial crisis
as the present one, and never at a more critical moment&quot;,
says Mr. Lofberg.  &quot;Unless it receives adequate funds, this
unique UN programme of assistance is at risk of collapse.  If
this is allowed to happen, I am afraid it would give the Palestine
refugees the message that their rights have been forsaken by the
international community&quot;, Mr. Lofberg affirmed.</P>

The Weight of History</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>Part 10<BR>
<I>By Israel Shahak</I></B></CENTER></P>

<P>At the same time, all the rabbis - who had to be designated
by the Patriarch - were freed from the most oppressive Roman taxes
and received many official privileges, such as exemption from
serving on town councils (which was also one of the first privileges
later granted to the Christian clergy). In addition, the Patriarch
was empowered to tax the Jews and to discipline them by imposing
fines, flogging and other punishments. He used this power in order
to suppress Jewish heresies and (as we know from the Talmud) to
persecute Jewish preachers who accused him of taxing the Jewish
poor for his personal benefit.</P>

<P>We know from Jewish sources that the tax-exempt rabbis used
excommunication and other means within their power to enhance
the religious hegemony of the Patriarch. We also hear, mostly
indirectly, of the hate and scorn that many of the Jewish peasants
and urban poor in Palestine had for the rabbis, as well as of
the contempt of the rabbis for the Jewish poor (usually expressed
as contempt for the 'ignorant'). Nevertheless, this typical colonial
arrangement continued, as it was backed by the might of the Roman
Empire.</P>

<P>Similar arrangements existed, within each country, during the
whole period of classical Judaism. Their social effects on the
Jewish communities differed, however, according to the size of
each community. Where there were few Jews, there was normally
little social differentiation within the community, which tended
to be composed of rich and middle-class Jews, most of whom had
considerable rabbinical-talmudic education. But in countries where
the number Of Jews increased and a big class of Jewish poor appeared,
the same cleavage as the one described above manifested itself,
and we observe the rabbinical class, in alliance with the Jewish
rich, oppressing the Jewish poor in its own interest as well as
in the interest of the state - that is, of the Crown and the nobility.
</P>

<P>This was, in particular, the situation in pre- 1795 Poland.
The specific circumstances of Polish Jewry will be outlined below.
Here I only want to point out that because of the formation of
a large Jewish community in that country, a deep cleavage between
the Jewish upper class (the rabbis and the rich) and the Jewish
masses developed there from the 18th century and continued throughout
the 19th century. So long as the Jewish community had power over
its members, the incipient revolts of the poor, who had to bear
the main brunt of taxation, were suppressed by the combined force
of the naked coercion of Jewish 'self-rule' and religious sanction.</P>

<P>Because of all this, throughout the classical period (as well
as in modern times) the rabbis were the most loyal, not to say
zealous, supporters of the powers that be; and the more reactionary
the regime, the more rabbinical support it had.</P>

<P><I>3- The society of classical Judaism is in total opposition
to the surrounding non-Jewish society except the king (or the
nobles when they take over the state). </I></P>

<P>The consequences of these three social features, taken together,
go a long way towards explaining the history of classical Jewish
communities both in Christian and in Muslim countries.</P>

<P>The position of the Jews is particularly favourable under strong
regimes which have retained a feudal character, and in which national
consciousness, even at a rudimentary level has not yet begun to
develop. It is even more favourable in countries such as pre-1795
Poland or in the Iberian kingdoms before the latter half of the
15th century, where the formation of a nationally based powerful
feudal monarchy was temporarily or permanently arrested. In fact,
classical Judaism flourishes best under strong regimes which are
dissociated from most classes in society, and in such regimes
the Jews fulfil one of the functions of a middle class - but in
a permanently dependent form. For this reason they are opposed
not only by the peasantry (whose opposition is then unimportant,
except for the occasional and rare popular revolt) but more importantly
by the non-Jewish middle class (which was on the rise in Europe),
and by the plebeian part of the clergy; and they are protected
by the upper clergy and the nobility. But in those countries where,
feudal anarchy having been curbed, the nobility enters into partnership
with the king (and with at least part of the bourgeoisie) to rule
the state, which assumes a national or proto-national form, the
position of the Jews deteriorates.</P>

<P>This general scheme, valid for Muslim and Christian countries
alike, will now be illustrated briefly by a few examples.</P>

<P><B><I>England, France and Italy</I></B></P>

<P>Since the first period of Jewish residence in England was so
brief, and coincided with the development of the English national
feudal monarchy, this country can serve as the best illustration
of the above scheme. Jews were brought over to England by William
the Conqueror, as part of the French-speaking Norman ruling class,
with the primary duty of granting loans to those lords, spiritual
and temporal, who were otherwise unable to pay their feudal dues
(which were particularly heavy in England and more rigorously
exacted in that period than in any other European monarchy). Their
greatest royal patron was Henry II, and the Magna Carta marked
the beginning of their decline, which continued during the conflict
of the barons with Henry III. The temporary resolution of this
conflict by Edward I, with the formation of Parliament and of
'ordinary' and fixed taxation, was accompanied by the expulsion
of the Jews.</P>

<P>Similarly, in France the Jews flourished during the formation
of the strong feudal principalities in the 11th and 12th centuries,
including the Royal Domain; and their best protector among the
Capetian kings was Louis VII (1137-80), notwithstanding his deep
and sincere Christian piety. At that time the Jews of France counted
themselves as knights (in Hebrew, parashim) and the leading Jewish
authority in France, Rabbenu Tam, warns them never to accept an
invitation by a feudal lord to settle on his domain, unless they
are accorded privileges similar to those of other knights. The
decline in their position begins with Philip II Augustus, originator
of the political and military alliance of the Crown with the rising
urban commune movement, and plummets under Philip IV the Handsome,
who convoked the first Estates General for the whole of France
in order to gain support against the pope. The final expulsion
of Jews from the whole of France is closely bound up with the
firm establishment of the Crown's rights of taxation and the national
character of the monarchy.</P>

<P>Similar examples can be given from other European countries
where Jews were living during that period. Reserving Christian
Spain and Poland for a more detailed discussion, we remark that
in Italy, where many city states had a republican form of power,
the same regularity is discernible. Jews flourished especially
in the Papal States, in the twin feudal kingdoms of Sicily and
Naples (until their expulsion, on Spanish orders, circa 1500)
and in the feudal enclaves of Piedmont. But in the great commercial
and independent cities such as Florence their number was small
and their social role unimportant.</P>

<P><B><I>The Muslim World</I></B></P>

<P>The same general scheme applies to Jewish communities during
the classical period in Muslim countries as well, except for the
important fact that expulsion of Jews, being contrary to Islamic
law, was virtually unknown there. (Medieval Catholic canon law,
on the other hand, neither commands nor forbids such expulsion.)</P>

<P>Jewish communities flourished in the famous, but socially misinterpreted,
Jewish Golden Age in Muslim countries under regimes which were
particularly dissociated from the great majority of the people
they ruled, and whose power rested on nothing but naked force
and a mercenary army. The best example is Muslim Spain, where
the very real Jewish Golden Age (of Hebrew poetry, grammar, philosophy
etc) begins precisely with the fall of the Spanish Umayyad caliphate
after the death of the <I>de facto</I> ruler, al-Mansur, in 1002,
and the establishment of the numerous <I>ta'ifa</I> (faction)
kingdoms, all based on naked force. The rise of the famous Jewish
commander-in-chief and prime minister of the kingdom of Granada,
Samuel the Chief (Shmu'el Hannagid, died 1056), who was also one
of the greatest Hebrew poets of all ages, was based primarily
on the fact that the kingdom which he served was a tyranny of
a rather small Berber military force over the Arabic-speaking
inhabitants. A similar situation obtained in the other<I> ta'ifa</I>
Arab-Spanish kingdoms. The position of the Jews declined somewhat
with the establishment of the Almoravid regime (in 1086-90) and
became quite precarious under the strong and popular Almohad regime
(after 1147) when, as a result of persecutions, the Jews migrated
to the Christian Spanish kingdoms, where the power of the kings
was still very slight.</P>

<P>Similar observations can be made regarding the states of the
Muslim East. The first state in which the Jewish community reached
a position of important political influence was the Fatimid empire,
especially after the conquest of Egypt in 969, because it was
based on the rule of an Isma'ili-shi'ite religious minority. The
same phenomenon can he observed in the Seljuk states - based on
feudal-type armies, mercenaries and, increasingly, on slave troops
(<I>mamluks</I>) - and in their successor states. The favour of
Saladin to the Jewish communities, first in Egypt, then in other
parts of this expanding empire, was based not only on his real
personal qualities of tolerance, charity and deep political wisdom,
but equally on his rise to power as a rebellious commander of
mercenaries freshly arrived in Egypt.</P>

<P>But perhaps the best Islamic example is the state where the
Jews' position was better than anywhere else in the East since
the fall of the ancient Persian empire- the Ottoman empire, particularly
during its heyday in the 16th century. As is well known, the Ottoman
regime was based initially on the almost complete exclusion of
the Turks themselves (not to mention other Muslims by birth) from
positions of political power and from the most important part
of the army, the Janissary corps, both of which were manned by
the sultan's Christian-born slaves, abducted in childhood and
educated in special schools. Until the end of the 16th century
no free-born Turk could become a Janissary or hold any important
government office. In such a regime, the role of the Jews in their
sphere was quite analogous to that of the Janissaries in theirs.
Thus the position of the Jews was best under a regime which was
politically most dissociated from the peoples it ruled. With the
admission of the Turks themselves (as well as some other Muslim
peoples, such as the Albanians) to the ruling class of the Ottoman
empire, the position of the Jews declines. However, this decline
was not very sharp, because Of the continuing arbitrariness and
non-national character or the Ottoman regime.</P>

<P>This point is very important, in my opinion, because the relatively
good situation of Jews under Islam in general, and under certain
Islamic regimes in particular, is used by many Palestinian and
other Arab propagandists in a very ignorant, albeit perhaps well-meaning,
way. First, they generalise and reduce serious questions of politics
and history to mere slogans. Granted that the position of Jews
was, <I>on average</I>, much better under Islam than under Christianity
- the important question to ask is, under <I>what regimes</I>
was it better or worse? We have seen where such an analysis leads.</P>

<P>But, secondly and more importantly: in a pre-modern state,
a 'better' position of the Jewish community normally entailed
a greater degree of tyranny exercised within this community by
the rabbis against other Jews. To give one example: certainly,
the figure of Saladin is one which, considering his period, inspires
profound respect. But together with this respect, I for one cannot
forget that the enhanced privileges he granted to the Jewish community
in Egypt and his appointment of Maimonides as their Chief (<I>Nagid</I>)
immediately unleashed severe religious persecution of Jewish 'sinners'
by the rabbis. For instance, Jewish 'priests' (supposed descendants
Of the ancient priests who had served in the Temple) are forbidden
to marry not only prostitutes but also divorcees. This latter
prohibition, which has always caused difficulties, was infringed
during the anarchy under the last Fatimid rulers (circa 1130-80)
by such 'priests' who, contrary to Jewish religious law, were
married to Jewish divorcees in Islamic courts (which are nominally
empowered to marry non-Muslims). The greater tolerance towards
'the Jews' instituted by Saladin upon his accession to power enabled
Maimonides to issue orders to the rabbinical courts in Egypt to
seize all Jews who had gone through such forbidden marriages and
have them flogged until they 'agreed' to divorce their wives.
Similarly, in the Ottoman empire, the powers of the rabbinical
courts were very great and consequently most pernicious. Therefore,
the position of Jews in Muslim countries in the past should never
he used as a political argument in contemporary (or future) contexts.</P>
