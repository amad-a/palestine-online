<h3>No, We Are Not Who You Thought We Are</h3>

<p> By Musa Budeiri Ha'aretz, October 24, 
  2000 

<p>In democracies, soldiers - characterized by a Teutonic mindset - are not 
  usually reincarnated as political leaders. This is another area in which Israel 
  does not conform to the dominant West European model. Perhaps this explains 
  the ease with which the state opens fire on and kills its own citizens, and 
  the near total consensus of its citizens with regard to the righteousness of 
  such actions.What is even more puzzling is the inability of Israel's political 
  leaders - whether they are embarking on murder missions (Barak in Beirut) or 
  on negotiated settlements (Barak at Camp David) - to comprehend the Palestinian 
  "other." 

<p>After more than a century of Zionist emigration to a land without a 
  people - with discoveries at various historical junctures that there are indeed 
  forms of human life in this pocket-sized piece of territory, only to be followed 
  by lapses of memory - there seems to be a sense of shock and betrayal pervading 
  all shades of the political spectrum in light of the discovery that over the 
  past seven years, the erstwhile enemy hesitantly transformed into a "peace partner," 
  very unlike the partner it was perceived to be. The shock is real; the wound 
  is deep! 

<p>Barak and the rest of the Zionist "peace camp" are indeed correct. 
  The Palestinians are not who they thought they were. Some 50 years after the 
  expulsion from Palestine and its dismemberment; 33 years after the onset of 
  the occupation and the colonial regime instituted by the Jewish state; 18 years 
  after the onslaught on Beirut, the siege and the bombardment; and eight years 
  since the beginning of the Oslo process, which appeared to be the only practical 
  alternative to Gaza refusing to "sink into the sea," the Palestinians are still 
  the same. 

<p>Whether in Jerusalem, Nablus, Acre, Damascus, Nazareth, Beirut or 
  Amman, and whether traditional or modern, religious or secular, faithful or 
  adulterous, left or right, apathetic or political, middle of the road or lunatic 
  fringe, pragmatists or seekers of paradise, straight or gay, they have not become 
  Zionists nor have they acquiesced to their own dispossession and dehumanization. <p>
  Their grudging support for the peace process, initiated at Madrid and Oslo, 
  was their acceptance of a historic compromise to partition Palestine and to 
  afford Israel and Israelis the opportunity to integrate themselves into the 
  neighborhood. Notwithstanding the frequent disparaging references to the "unsuitability" 
  of the neighborhood, Israelis are well advised to remember that they were not 
  invited guests, but arrived here on the tailcoats of British bayonets. Those 
  who are fond of referring to their aversion to the neighborhood are obviously 
  suffering from historical amnesia. 

<p>The nature of the Central and Eastern European 
  neighborhood from where their parents originated was the very reason that forced 
  them to leave that particular neighborhood in the first place. To be sure, most 
  went to "the new Jerusalem," but some made their way to Palestine, embarking 
  on a colonial, nation-building project under the banner of a secular religion, 
  Zionism, which was meant to liberate them from the shtetl and its medieval shackles. 
  In any case, an earthquake soon overtook their original neighborhood and it 
  was no more.

<p> The perception of the Palestinians' current "betrayal" and consequent 
  disqualification as "peace partners" says more about the substance of the "peace 
  process" Israel wishes to impose both on the Palestinians and the region than 
  all the proposals and agreements that have been circulating since a short-sighted 
  and opportunistic Palestinian leadership acquiesced to Israeli dictates at Oslo. <p>

  Israeli politicians of all hues, buttressed by an ideological media reminiscent 
  of the conformist-peddlers and opinion-enforcers of the recently-departed authoritarian 
  regimes of Eastern Europe, do not tire of repeating, parrot-style, the Barak/Ben-Ami 
  line about the generosity of Israel's "for a limited time only" offer at Camp 
  David. This has been handed to the Palestinians in the form of an ultimatum, 
  with the implied, and often stated, rider that this is more than they justly 
  deserve. 

<p>Israeli self-perception is that it is giving of itself. Whereas Palestinians 
  perceive it as a compromise between Israelis and that the only serious negotiations 
  in which the Israelis are prepared to indulge are negotiations among themselves. 
  <p>What is on offer is Sharon's plan of autonomy: no sovereignty, no territorial 
  contiguity, the permanence of settlements, window-dressing in Jerusalem and, 
  in effect, the establishment of a Palestistan, with a free option for the Palestinians 
  to call it a state or even an empire if they so choose. 

<p>Israel, variously characterized 
  as "the only democracy in the Middle East," an ethnic democracy and a garrison 
  democracy - among other laudatory titles - is openly transforming itself into 
  an apartheid state. This is clearly evident in its treatment of its Palestinian 
  minority, a million strong, who for fifty years were "tolerated" by a secular 
  Zionist mindset, only to be redefined as "a cancer" and "a fifth column" the 
  moment they dared express their identity as a Palestinian national minority 
  in a state in which the intellectual elite are celebrating the arrival of multi-culturalism 
  and post-Zionism. 

<p>The Palestinians are not who you thought they are. Surprising 
  or even shocking as it may appear, their perceptions of a peace settlement do 
  not stem from the needs and requirements of Israeli security or the ever-lasting 
  debate over the Jewish character of the state.

<p> Perhaps foolishly, they view 
  themselves as victims, initially of superpower rivalries and European conflicts. 
  Since 1948, and in an age of nation states, they alone were deemed to be non-deserving. 
  <p>Having arrived at Oslo, still foolish, they assumed that their acceptance of 
  a two-state solution and their making do with less than a quarter of the territory 
  of historic Palestine would satisfy Israeli demands for recognition and legitimation. 
  This was the historic compromise and "peace of the brave" that would satisfy 
  Israel and enable them to begin the reconstruction of their national life, shattered 
  since 1948. All that was left was to negotiate the modalities of ending the 
  occupation. 

<p>What transpired in the seven years since has made Palestinians realize 
  that the Israelis are not who they thought they were. The Israeli search for 
  a peace partner was confined to candidates within the Israeli political spectrum 
  - the Likud, and perhaps the National Religious Party or Shas. 

<p>From an Israeli 
  perspective, the task was not to end the occupation of the territories conquered 
  in June 1967, but to reach a set-up that would enhance Israel's security by 
  getting rid of the maximum number of Palestinian Arabs while retaining the maximum 
  amount of Palestinian territory.

<p> Authority over the Palestinians would be handed 
  to Palestinians who would be entrusted with the task of safeguarding Israel's 
  security, without being hampered by democratic niceties, contradictory as this 
  may seem, in that Israel is probably the only country in the world which has 
  legally sanctioned the use of torture and where assassination squads operate 
  openly. 

<p>The sense of betrayal felt in light of the Palestinians' refusal to 
  continue with the charade of a peace process, the guiding light of which is 
  the preponderance of military might and the use of force to pound the "peace 
  partner" into submission, would be laughable, were it not for the tragedy it 
  portends for all the inhabitants of the region. 

<p>Israelis could do worse than 
  re-read Hannah Arendt's trenchant critique, written as far back as 1945: "It 
  will not be easy either to save the Jews or to save Palestine in the twentieth 
  century; that it can be done with categories and methods of the nineteenth century 
  seems, at the very least, highly improbable."
