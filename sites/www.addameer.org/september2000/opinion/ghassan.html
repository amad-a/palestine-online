<h3>ARE PALESTINIAN KIDS REAL KIDS AND ARE THEIR PARENTS
REAL PARENTS?</h3>
<p> By Ghassan Androni, PCR Exec. Dir.
<p>11 February 2001




    <p> For the past few weeks an open debate has been held in
Israel concerning its bad profile in the international
media. Media people, officials, and academics discuss
issues related to the images media deliver all over the
world about the recent crisis.

    <p> What attracted my attention was the intensive
discussion about why the number of children killed or
injured is so high and how Israel should defend its doings.
The image of Rami (Mohammad Al Dura) was discussed
extensively. Most of the arguments I heard go in the
following direction: Palestinians are sending their kids to
the army posts around the cities to be killed so as to
embarrass Israel. What does that mean?

    <p> Palestinians are not like other humans, they do not
care for their kids, they do not love them, and they use
them to embarrass Israelis. So, Palestinians do not grieve
death like other humans and, maybe, they are bloodsuckers.
Not a single spectator, including the very well-known media
hero, Tomi Labid, even bothered to examine if there was
something wrong on their side.

     <p>In an interview by CNN, [Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud
Barak was more disgusting than all. With his cold face, and
after referring to the point of Palestinians using their
kids in the front lines to embarrass Israel he said; "Look,
why did Rami's father bring him to this remote place near
by the Israeli military post?" Smart!! He brought him to
embarrass Israeli soldiers, as a target to be shot at. Mr.
Barak, have you seen the father of Rami on TV? Have you
seen the fear in his face, the pain in his eyes? Have you
seen how much he cried and appealed to your soldiers to
stop shooting? How much he tried to protect his son with
his own body? Or was that just acting in front of the
camera? Mr. Barak, this is exactly why you can only be a
war general and never a peacemaker.

     <p>Palestinians, like other humans, can fall into
wrongdoing while being angry, oppressed, frustrated, due to
living under occupation. Yet your soldiers and settlers are
snipers planning death by orders.

     <p>Many are referring to the need to use excessive force,
because among the Palestinian demonstrators there are some
who carry weapons and use them. Need we be reminded that
the day after [Ariel] Sharon forced himself into the
Al-Aqsa Mosque yard, protesters inside the mosque who had
no weapons were shot at randomly. Seven were killed and
hundreds injured in one hour. May I ask what is the excuse
in this case?

     <p>I have never seen this level of dehumanizing people
employed, even by whites in the former apartheid regime of
South Africa. This level of racism can only be found in
societies that have one main function: to destroy
themselves and their neighbors.
