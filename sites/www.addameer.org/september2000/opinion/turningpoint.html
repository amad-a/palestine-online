<h3>Turning Point in the Palestinian Struggle</h3>


<p>Dr. Majed Nassar<br>
Nassar Ibrahim<br>
13.10.2000<br>
Palestine
 <p>
Yesterday, the Palestinian people experienced a turning point in their
lives. The struggle of the Palestinian people against the Israeli
occupation has reached a new peak. The people witnessed a savage
bombardment using tanks, rockets, and helicopters.  40 rockets were 
fired
over Ramallah and another 90 over Gaza and other cities. Fortunately, 
no
one was killed but numerous people were injured.  Many buildings were
destroyed. The main aim of the Israeli government is to break the 
spirit of
the Palestinian people.  Barak announced that this is only a token of 
what
the Palestinians can expect.  The other aim is to bring the 
Palestinians to
the negotiating table before the Arab summit.  In view of what is 
happening
in the Arab World: the mass demonstrations, the increasing pressure 
over
the Arab regimes, the closing of the Israeli office in Oman, the 
explosion
of the US battle ship at the shores of Yemen, the explosion of the 
British
embassy in Yemen too, and the recall of the Moroccan Ambassador back to
Morocco, it becomes more  important for the US government and Israel to
defuse the Arab national movement that is rising.
What is going on at present is a clear attempt to contain the 
Palestinian
resistance on the national, Arab, and international levels.  The Unites
States is white-washing the Israeli government.  And at the same time 
the
United States is forcing its hegemony and monopoly on the region.  The
threats given by the US to the Arab states, especially Egypt (Egypt
receives US $ 3 billion yearly from the US) are loud and clear, to 
ensure
that they dance to the US orchestra.
Robert Fisk wrote in his article from the 13.10.2000:  "This is a story
about lies, bias, hatred and death.  It is about our inability -after 
more
than half a century - to understand the injustice of the Middle East."
Robert Fisk is right. The media is playing a dirty role.  They are 
indeed
diverting our minds from the truth.  They are indeed the dispensers of 
the
most obsequious and deformed information.

 <p>Given the scandalous number of Palestinian casualties and the 
increasing
bloodshed throughout Palestine since 28 September 2000, and the 
numerous
confrontations during the past one hundred years, is there a 
possibility to
talk about a peace in the Middle East that overrides the legitimate 
rights
of the Palestinian people?

 <p>The Oslo Agreement of 1993 came about in order to quell the Intifada of
1987, and brought with it not only the means to neglect the legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people but also the placebo of self-rule.  
The
country was torn into bantustans through the creation of areas A, B, 
and C,
and the paving of bypass roads to further isolate Palestinian towns and
villages. The settlements increased at breakneck speed.  In addition, 
the
Oslo Agreement tried to destroy the unity of the Palestinian people 
within
Palestine and abroad.  Since the signing of the Oslo Agreement, the
Palestinian social and economic situation continues to deteriorate.  
The
dividends of (Oslo) peace were not there.

 <p>The Israeli government viewed the Oslo Accord as an irresistible
opportunity to coerce the Palestinians to sign a historic agreement
sanctioning the imposition of its policies and programs and so-called
"facts on the ground."   With the decreasing momentum of the resistance
movement and the increasing fragmentation of the Arab World, Israel and 
the
United States seized this opportunity to employ the Israeli-American
"solution" to end the conflict. The Israelis used the imbalance of 
world
powers on the international and national levels to introduce their plan 
as
the only viable solution.  This plan is based on the following:
 <p>
1. the transformation of Arab military defeats into permanent and fixed
Israeli political victories;<br>
2. the rejection of Israeli withdrawal to the borders of 4 June 1967;<br>
3. the rejection of the Palestinian right to return;<br>
4. the claim that Jerusalem is the united and eternal capital of Israel<br>
5. the plan to keep the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza under 
Israeli
sovereignty<br>
6. the rejection of a sovereign Palestinian state;<br>
7. Israel's complete denial to acknowledge its responsibility for the
Palestinian disaster of 1948.<br>

<p>The present Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation stems from 
this
reality.  At the same time, "final status" negotiations are continuing 
in
Washington to pass the final agreement with the help of a strong 
American
lobby.

<p>The new uprising of the last days has served to remind us of the simple
fact that the conflicts and explosions occurring from Gaza to Nazareth 
and
the Galilee and the Triangle, are nothing but a concentrated and
significant expression of Palestinian resistance to Israeli oppression.  
In
addition, they are a sign of the intense anger of the Palestinian 
people
toward the so-called facts on the ground that Israel is trying to 
impose by
force.  In short, the Intifada is the Palestinian response to Israel's
calculated plans to deny the rights of Palestinians and to force them 
to
abdicate their legitimate political aspirations and expectations.  For
these reasons, the Oslo Agreement was a failure, even from the 
beginning,
as it was used as a tool to break the Palestinian will and force an
attitude of surrender.

<p>Within the present context of violence and bloodshed, and taking into
account its historical, political, and psychological dimensions, we 
must
re-articulate the facts and the equations in order to reveal the 
situation
for what it is.  How can we explain the disproportionate violence of 
the
Israeli army, with its concentrated use of rockets, combat helicopters, 
and
tanks?  How can we explain the open confrontation on the part of
Palestinians and their readiness to die?  How can we explain the 
explosion
of Palestinian people in the cities and villages of 1948.  What are the
consequences of the mobilization of Arab peoples in various cities of 
the
Arab World?  What is the meaning of the signs of solidarity that we see 
in
Europe?

<p>These questions and others situate us squarely in the midst of a 
complex
picture whose clarity must be restored once again, given the 
distortions
that have been revealed since Madrid.

<p>Of critical importance is the necessity to expose Israel's 
"understanding"
of peace, namely, the exclusive imposition of its will and strategy to
obliterate the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.  Israel's 
terms
of reference are power, terror, and unconditional U. S. support.  Any
Palestinian attempt at resistance and refusal to bow to Israel's will 
must
therefore be met with raw force and violence.  This fact explains the
political imbalance of the so-called peace process and reveals that the
goal of the process is to impose surrender rather than peace.
Israel attempted to impose a political settlement without taking into
consideration the reality of the historic confrontation.  Implicit in 
this
reality are the historic roots, memory, civilization, and national 
depth of
the Palestinian people.   In other words,  the logic of force and 
imbalance
of power are unable to annihilate the rights of this people or its 
vision.
This is what Jacques Chirac meant when he condemned Israel's policy 
against
the Palestinian people, saying, "You cannot face the feelings of a 
people
with tanks."

<p>The extreme violence used by Israel against the Palestinian uprising is
nothing but  another attempt to coerce the world into buying into its
understanding of "peace,"  namely, a peace based on surrender.   Any
attempt to reject this notion will be faced by destruction, rendering 
the
Palestinian people impotent in front of the  cycle of defeat and 
surrender.
 Peace, according to Israel, turns out to be a continuation of 
occupation
and oppression.

<p>The Palestinian people have lost their trust in the ongoing peace 
process.
After waiting seven years, they found themselves even more stifled and
paralyzed by Israel's "facts on the ground."   The Palestinians have 
fought
for over 50 years to defend their rights.  At a certain stage they 
found
themselves dealing with a peace initiative, but toward what end?  Not 
only
were they asked to give more concessions than they could reasonably 
give,
but the reality of the situation was finally revealed:  the peace 
process
for the Palestinian people is, in fact, a process of selling out..  The
West Bank and Gaza were torn apart into areas A, B, and C.  The bypass
roads fragmented cities and villages and transformed them into 
bantustans.
Settlement activities are increasing as a consequence of this "peace
initiative."    Prisoners have become a bargaining chip in order to
blackmail Palestinian leaders during negotiations.  Jerusalem was 
simply
removed from the equation.   Millions of refugees and displaced persons
have lost hope of ever returning, and have succumbed to the bleak 
reality
that the Palestinian refugee camp is no longer a temporary but a 
permanent
place to stay.  Finally, nothing has changed in the treatment of the
Palestinian people, in terms of movement, borders, house demolitions, 
etc.

<p>While this is the undeniable reality, Palestinians are asked to accept 
this
"peace" that is accompanied by violence and oppression.  Palestinians 
have
no other choice than to remind the world of this reality and to reveal 
the
devastating consequences of deceit. The recent provocation of Ariel 
Sharon
when he entered the Haram a-Sharif, claiming it was a "normal" visit of 
a
"normal Jew" is nothing but a stupid move. But it was fuel enough to 
ignite
the minefield.

<p>Within the context of this tragic reality, Palestinians were again
painfully reminded of their experience, their suffering, their stolen 
land.
 They were reminded of the "peace" that has been talked about ad 
nauseam
but that remains an elusive dream.  They were reminded of their former
cities and villages and their present-day refugees….

<p>The only option available to them was to enter into confrontation and
resist occupation.  Peace without Jerusalem is not peace.  Peace 
without
land and the right of refugees to return is not peace.  Peace without 
an
end to occupation and the removal of settlements is not peace.  Well 
aware
that confrontation means death, Palestinians find themselves in front 
of
the choice to die surrendering, or to die resisting.  This is the 
reason
that an unarmed people can choose to face Israeli soldiers and be ready 
to
die.

<p>The Israeli occupation, moreover, has attempted to confine the conflict 
in
terms of its own understanding of the balance of power and how to use 
it
politically in the course of imminent elections.  Sharon continues his
provocation tactics in order to convince the Zionists that he is the 
one to
lead them, and Barak responds with an even stronger extremism.  Both 
are
engaged in a competition to win the support of the extremist party.  
Within
such a context, peace doesn't have a chance. ( the US presidential
candidates behaved in a similar manner, competing who can be the better
servant of Israel)

<p>The killings of the past days are racial killings.  For this reason, 
the
Palestinians in Nazareth, Akka, Haifa, etc., have stood up to affirm 
their
presence and their Palestinian nationality.  The Intifada of the
Palestinians from 1948 is not only an Intifada of solidarity but an
Intifada for themselves.  The Palestinian uprising confronts the world 
with
the truth of what Israel is and the racist policies that are its 
foundation
for survival.

<p>Until now, more than 100 people have been killed and 3,000 injured.  
Where
is it going to lead?  And how far are we going to go?  The Intifada 
might
stop, and the process of negotiations might be brought back on track.
Israel and the U. S. might even be able to impose new agreements, but 
that
doesn't mean that the conflict is over.  It is going to lead to a new 
cycle
of Israeli violence and Palestinian resistance.  Israel must reassess 
its
calculations and realize that even its war cannot coerce the 
Palestinian
people to surrender.  The United States must also reassess its position
regarding its biased support toward Israel and recognize that it cannot
guarantee its personal interests in the region without guaranteeing the
personal interests of the Palestinian people.  The Palestinian 
Authority
must also redo its calculations and learn from its previous lessons 
that
the policy of continuous concessions only serves to increase the 
appetite
of Israel and increases the situation of despair and mistrust among the
Palestinian people.  They all must be aware that the Palestinian people
will not accept a peace without justice.

<p>As long as Israel insists on imposing its terms and conditions on key
issues (refugees, Jerusalem, settlements, etc.), and continues its 
policies
of terror and killing and denying the legitimate rights the Palestinian
people, it is only a matter of days, months, or years when the 
Palestinian
people will stand up again to face Barak's tanks, airplanes, and 
fascist
tactics.  But even these tools of violence will not defeat the feelings 
and
aspirations of the Palestinian people.  The Israeli occupation of
Palestinian lands is the sole reason for all the bloodshed and 
suffering
that is happening now.
Taking all this into consideration, the Palestinian people have no 
other
choice but to  continue their resistance to the Israeli occupation 
until it
is over.
