<h3>How Many More Days of Misery?</h3>



 <p>
Arjan El Fassed

<p>How many more Palestinians need to be killed before the world opens its
eyes? How many more Palestinians need to suffer this horrendous price 
for
freedom? How many more need to be punished by Israel for their 
existence -
through imprisonment, killing, torture, expulsion, loss of property and
freedom? 

<p>When does the world opens its eyes to see that this is all a campaign 
to
exterminate Palestinians as a human presence on the land of their
ancestors. To former Israeli Prime Minister Begin they were "two-legged
vermin"; to MK Michael Eitan they were "drugged roaches in a bottle"; 
to
former Israeli Prime Minister Shamir they were "grasshoppers"; to the 
more
polite Israeli public they were "the Arabs of Judea and Samaria"; and 
to
the New York Times they were simply "terrorists" or just "Arabs".

<p>When does the world comes to see that the Palestinians are human beings 
who
just want to continue their daily lives and that of their children on 
the
land they inherited from their ancestors. Those who have been driven 
out by
aggression or by fear thereof, just want to return home and live as 
human
beings on the lands that were owned by their parents and grandparents.

<p>Over the years of negotiations, what has been left out of media 
attention
is the increasing Israeli intransigence and actual violence. This 
policy of
persecution and discrimination is what Palestinians have contested and 
will
contest. It is a fact of their lives, more than negotiating-rounds with 
US
diplomats who are keener Zionists than the Israeli negotiators 
themselves.

<p>The United States has been supplying the Israeli occupation forces with 
the
bullets that have killed 12-year old Mohammad in the arms of his dad 
and
have killed 18-months year old Rania. Palestinians, not only in 
Palestine,
but also those who are living in exile, cannot register and attest to 
the
suffering of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation. The inside and
outside has become one.

<p>All illusions of improving the "quality of life" or in what Oslo became 
known as the "peace dividend" are inherently unrealistic and in direct
contradiction to the aspirations of the Palestinians to live in 
freedom.
The "quality" argument is just another attempt to "sugar-coat" the
occupation for both world consumption and for local consumption as the
means of making an abhorrent situation of oppression palatable to the
oppressed. 

<p>Peace is not the outcome of an arbitrary "trial and error" policy, or 
the
result of a negative, partial selection of incomplete components, which
form only part of a total and coherent plan. A necessary prerequisite 
to
any peace process is the commitment to clear and final objectives, 
namely,
self-determination, freedom and return. 

<p>Since Oslo, Israel has succeeded in imposing, and getting, the PLO to 
sign
an agreement defining 'peace' that rests on unconditional security for
Israel but extremely conditional security for the Palestinians, both 
under
occupation and in the diaspora. 

<p>Israeli abuses, if mentioned at all, are treated as "obstacles to 
peace" 
rather than human rights or international law violations. The scope and
gravity of Israel's human rights violations is widely known, reported 
and
documented. Its relentless efforts to legitimise blatantly illegal acts 
(to
justify what cannot be justified) renders Israel's abuses unique. 

<p>Israel relies on its self-made laws to trample basic human rights - 
from 
sanctioning torture to taking hostages, from establishing and expanding 
Jewish colonies to demolishing homes, from deporting Palestinians and 
prevening millions to return home to deliberately discriminating 
against the 
Palestinian population in all matters relating to land expropriation, 
planning, and building and executes a racist policy against 
Palestinians who 
remained in the land they were born.

<p>The US is imposing its own rules on a world that has had enough of
imperialist and expansionist states. At a time when freedom and 
democracy
have supposedly triumphed over authoritarian regimes, censorship and 
media
manipulation are, paradoxically, making a comeback, more powerful than
before. With no moral claim on any count, the US has been bombing and
committed genocide in Iraq. In the Washington Times of December 13, 
1995,
war criminal Madeline Albright, openly called the UN "a tool of 
American
foreign policy". Now Washington has abandoned the UN altogether and is
mediating a deal between an occupation and its patron to serve its
interests in the region. 

<p>Palestinians would need shoes the size of the earth in order to kick 
this
world in the pants -  this world that insists that victim and 
executioner
are equal; this world which goes to extremes in its cruelty toward the
victim and its sympathy for the executioner in asking the victim to 
please
exercise self-restraint and control his reactions. The US has a mean
attitude that cannot be disputed, even meaner are those who demand that 
we
keep quiet and give this US cooked peace yet another chance.
