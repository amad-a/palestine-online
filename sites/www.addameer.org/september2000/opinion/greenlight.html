<h3>A Green Light to Slaughter</h3>
<p>  By Tanya Reinhart
 
<p>October 21, 2000



<p>In the Sharm-al-Sheikh summit last week, Barak got from the US his 
green
light to slaughter. To judge by the Israeli media, what we have seen so
far is just the prelude. "The most important will come in the middle of
next week, when... Israel will have to consider taking the initiative,
rather than merely responding to events." ('Haaretz', Amos Harel, Oct
19.00) Bits and pieces of the "initiative" have been revealed: It
includes entering PA areas "to confiscate weapons," and 'inevitable' 
air
raids. <p>
There is talk about the Palestinian Kosovo, with 2000-3000
Palestinians dead. As usual, the blame for this slaughter is put in
advance on Arafat, who, the story goes, wants his people to be
slaughtered, to gain international sympathy. Another aspect of what is
being planned has started already, with very little coverage, under the
calm title of 'evacuation'. Palestinian residents of' areas of 
conflict'
near Jewish settlements have been called to evacuate their homes "for
their own protection." So far this happened in El-Bireh (7.10),
Beit-Jallah (18.10) and the Askar refugee camp near Nablus (19.10). And
this is just the beginning.<p> In more direct words - transfer under the
pretext of war. The military preparations and training for the Israeli
attack have started already in June, when Barak first informed the
Israeli media that "there is a danger of a Palestinian unrest, 
following
the model of Southern Lebanon." But to get there, it was first 
necessary
to manifest Barak's unprecedented eagerness for peace. The model was
rehearsed on Syria earlier this year: Intensive "peace talks" at the 
end
of which Barak declared that there is no partner for peace. The Camp
David "peace round" was sufficient to convince the obedient Israeli
media that the same is true of the Palestinians. All that was still
needed was US approval. U.S. APPROVAL For three weeks now, Barak has
been dragging full execution, waiting for US green light. As reported 
in
early October, "Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is appealing to the
United States for approval of a massive offensive against Lebanon and
the Palestinian Authority. So far, the United States has appealed to
Barak for more time." (World Tribune, Oct 9) We may have been fooled to
believe he won't get US approval this time. <p>There is so much opposition
to Israel's acts throughout the world. The Arab world is storming with
demonstrations. US embassies had to close temporarily, and the Yemen
explosion was some indication of the burning soil. The US was first
cautious - not even the customary vetoing of the Security Council
resolution.<p> CNN - the most direct seismograph of the White House -
betrayed the hesitations. There was a week when sharp criticism of
Israel was allowed in their news, along with the standard pro-Israeli
propaganda, and even Edward Said got a full-length interview, probably
for the first time in CNN's history. But no more! - The three weeks of
deliberations did end with a green light. Intensive diplomacy of 
threats
and promises convinced the US that the Arab regimes could still be
relied upon to stand their people's pressure. They expect the
Arab-league summit to end up as a harmless ceremony. They believe that
when it ends, the tanks can start talking, undisturbed. For the US, 
this
is a dangerous game.<p> But what's at stake here is not just its automatic
backing of Israel. The explosive Arab anger has been directed at the US
no less than Israel. The rational move for the US would have been to
cool things off for now, to stop Barak. But that has never been the US
strategy. They can't tolerate even the slight disobedience of loyal
servants. They have to show who is the master. ARAFAT'S ROLE in the
Sharm-al-Sheikh summit, Arafat complied again. We may have been fooled
to believe that this time, under the pressure of his people, he is 
going
to change. 

<p>But it is too late for him to change. The tragedy of the
Palestinian people is that the person who in the past symbolized their
struggle in the world's eyes has turned into an executer of the Israeli
occupation. The substantial issue which was worked out in the summit,
behind the public show of "cease fire", was the security agreement,
which guarantees Arafat's continued commitment to do the security job
for Israel, namely, prevent Palestinian retaliations inside Israel. As
reported in 'haaretz', "its implementation will be overseen by CIA 
chief
George Tenet and the CIA representative in Tel Aviv. This agreement
will, for the first time, involve CIA observers in the field in 
addition
to CIA participation in Israeli-Palestinian meetings." ('Haaretz', Aluf
Ben, Oct 18.00) Indeed, just a day after the summit, Israeli undercover
unit seized eight Palestinians who were in the crowd that lynched two
Israeli soldiers a week before. "The operation was carried out with the
connivance of some members of the Palestinian security forces, who
apparently tipped off the Israelis where to find the men." ('The
Telegraph' (U.K.), Alan Phillips in Jerusalem, 19 October 2000) The
official propaganda in Israel is that Arafat is responsible for the
uprising, and "he is not a real partner for peace." Not only does this
provide the continuous justification for the planned slaughter, but it
is also the biggest service Israel can offer in return for Arafat's
compliance. Israel's constant 'dissatisfaction' with Arafat is his only
claim for credibility. When Israel intensified its murder of unarmed
demonstrators, on Friday the 20th (with 10 dead in one day) Arafat's
spokesman, Arikaat, was interviewed pleading no other then the US to
investigate and to protect the Palestinians. This follows another
concession of Arafat at Sharm- al-Sheikh- No more pleas to the
international community. From now on, Little Red Riding hood can only
call the wolf to protect her. If there is anything that could still
prevent the bloodshed, it is international intervention. International
inspectors, UN forces, or even just NGO volunteers present in the area
could potentially slow down Israeli forces. It is therefore extremely
important now to understand Arafat's collaborating role, and to 
remember
that it is Israel, rather than the Palestinian people, who view the US
as the 'neutral moderator'.
