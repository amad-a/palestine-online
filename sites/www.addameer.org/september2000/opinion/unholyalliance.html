<h3>The Unholy Alliance: Labor in a Likud-Led Governmen</h3>
<p>By Dr. Hanan Ashrawi
<p> 


Jerusalem, February 27, 2001 
<p>

On February 26, 2001, Israeli Labor Party's Central Committee 
voted by
a two-third's majority to join a "unity" government under the
leadership of Likud's Ariel Sharon.
<p>
Despite serious reservations and outright dissent by such Labor
leaders as Shlomo Ben-Ami, Yossi Beilin, Abraham Burg (among others),
it appears that Israel's "moderate" forces (let alone "peace camp")
have opted for their docile cooption and self-negation.
<p>
Having accepted a "junior partner" role in Sharon's right-wing
government, Labor has abandoned any claims to a "higher moral ground"
and has become complicit in Sharon's blood-drenched past and
warmongering present.
<p>
By joining forces with such unlikely partners as Avigdor Lieberman and
Rahba'am Ze'evi, Labor has indirectly given a "green light" to the
politics of hate, violence, and racism.
<p>
Thus it presented Sharon and his crew with the badly needed fig leaf
to present themselves before the world as "presentable" within
civilized society. Extremism has therefore become an acceptable norm.
<p>
Shimon Peres, no less, has been selected (or has self-elected) to do
the dry-cleaning job as foreign minister in a government that does not
bode well for Israel, the region, or for peace as a whole.
<p>
Just as lethal is the notion of appointing a Labor minister of defense
to carry out the "dirty work" of the Sharon government.
<p>
Forming close to one-third of this right-wing government, Labor has
thus been recruited as apologists for the opposition and an instrument
of its repression -a role no self respecting "moderate" party would
have contemplated, let alone fought for.
<p>
The Israeli public thus finds itself instantly deprived of an honest
and active opposition to seek as an alternative or as a corrective
force when the extremists go on the rampage or wreak havoc within
Israel society and the region.
<p>
Democracy in Israel has been dealt yet another blow by those who had
claimed to be its most vociferous proponents.
<p>
Peace has been dealt a fatal blow by those who had claimed to seek it.
<p>
The real question is whether this is the true face of Labor or another
depth to which it had plummeted.
<p>
Having built more settlements than any previous government, and having
resorted to more bloodshed and brutality against the Palestinians than
any other right- or left-wing party, labor is now crowning its
"achievements" with this unholy (though not entirely surprising)
alliance.
<p>
As had been the case with all Likud-led coalition governments, the
left will be marginalized or neutralized and the whole political
discourse will shift to the right.
<p>
The "consensus" position will be formulated by the extreme political
right in conjunction with the fundamentalist religious elements, but
will gain a hearing as articulated by the "left."
<p>
Those who claim that such an alliance will curb the right wing and
save the prospects for peace are, at best, guilty of self-delusion. At
worst, they have placed their personal self-interest above those lofty
objectives that they claim to serve.
<p>
By pretending to snatch "peace" from the jaws of war (or the Sharon
gang), Labor apologists had better remember that even in their own
policies they had failed to meet the minimal requirements of a just
peace. By joining forces with an even more hard-line government, they
are making peace all that more unattainable while glossing over the
destructive agenda of their partners.
<p>
A cosmetic Labor might be more delusional than a party suffering from
the intoxication of power.
<p>
It might contribute to the longevity of this right wing government,
but it will simultaneously fragment its own ranks.
<p>
Perhaps this is what Labor really needs-a painful opportunity to put
its own house in order by sifting its own membership and reformulating
its future policies.
<p>
As Palestinians, we have never suffered from the illusion that Labor
is God's gift to peace or is a Palestinian ally.
<p>
However, a "peace engagement" could have served to educate the peace
camp in Israel and to raise its awareness of the requirements of a
genuine peace, thus shedding its preconceived and inherited notions of
an imposed peace by dictat or coercion.
<p>
Having missed this opportunity, Labor resorted to the harshest
punitive measures and the most violent means of repression, while
indulging in a willful exercise of blaming the victim and Palestinian
bashing.
<p>
Instead of drawing the proper conclusions, Labor embraced Likud and
opted for further schizophrenic politics.
<p>
Perhaps the time has come for Labor to look within, to indulge in a
genuine exercise of self-examination, and even to fragment in order to
regroup on a clear and sound peace policy.
<p>
Perhaps the current opportunism and loss of bearings is a necessary
step towards a more honest reformulation-liberated from the legacy of
occupation and patronizing domination.
<p>
Ultimately, the panic of the Israeli public will subside, and (it is
hoped) more rational minds will prevail once the dust settles and they
realize the futility of maintaining occupation and seeking security or
of negating Palestinian rights and seeking peace.

<p>When that happens, maybe there will be a few honest and brave
individuals who will present themselves as genuine candidates for a
real peace camp.

<p>Until then, we can only hope that this unholy alliance will not do
irreparable damage to the chances of peace within both Israel and
Palestine.
