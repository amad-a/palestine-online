<h3>The only alternative</h3>
<p>By Edward Said
<p>
I first visited South Africa in May 1991: a dark, wet, wintry period,

when Apartheid still ruled, although the ANC and Nelson Mandela 
had

been freed. Ten years later I returned, this time to summer, in a

democratic country in which Apartheid has been defeated, the ANC 
is in

power, and a vigorous, contentious civil society is engaged in trying

to complete the task of bringing equality and social justice to this

still divided and economically troubled country. But, the liberation

struggle that ended Apartheid and instituted the first democratically

elected government on 27 April 1994, remains one of the great 
human

achievements in recorded history. Despite the problems of the 
present,

South Africa is an inspiring place to visit and think about, partly

because for Arabs, it has a lot to teach us about struggle,

originality, and perseverance.
<p>

I came here this time as a participant in a conference on values in

education, organised by the Ministry of Education. Qader Asmal, the

minister of education, is an old and admired friend whom I met many

years ago when he was in exile in Ireland. I shall say more about him

in my next article. But, as a member of the cabinet, a longtime ANC

activist, and a successful lawyer and academic, he was able to

persuade Nelson Mandela (now 83, in frail health, and officially

retired from public life) to address the conference on the first

evening. What Mandela said then made a deep impression on me, as much

because of Mandela's enormous stature and profoundly affecting

charisma, as for the well-crafted words he uttered. Also a lawyer by

training, Mandela is an especially eloquent man who, in spite of

thousands of ritual occasions and speeches, always seems to have

something gripping to say.

<p>
This time it was two phrases about the past that struck me in a fine

speech about education, a speech which drew unflattering attention to

the depressed present state of the country's majority, "languishing in

abject conditions of material and social deprivation." Hence, he

reminded the audience, "our struggle is not over," even though -- here

was the first phrase -- the campaign against Apartheid "was one of the

great moral struggles" that "captured the world's imagination." The

second phrase was in his description of the anti-Apartheid campaign

not simply as a movement to end racial discrimination, but as a means

"for all of us to assert our common humanity." Implied in the words

"all of us" is that all of the races of South Africa, including the

pro-Apartheid whites, were envisaged as participating in a struggle

whose goal finally was coexistence, tolerance and "the realisation of

humane values."

<p>
The first phrase struck me cruelly: why did the Palestinian struggle

not (yet) capture the world's imagination and why, even more to the

point, does it not appear as a great moral struggle which, as Mandela

said about the South African experience, received "almost universal

support... from virtually all political persuasions and parties?"

<p>
True, we have received a great deal of general support, and yes, ours

is a moral struggle of epic proportions. The conflict between Zionism

and the Palestinian people is admittedly more complex than the battle

against Apartheid, even if in both cases one people paid and the other

is still paying a very heavy price in dispossession, ethnic cleansing,

military occupation and massive social injustice. The Jews are a

people with a tragic history of persecution and genocide. Bound by

their ancient faith to the land of Palestine, their "return" to a

homeland promised them by British imperialism was perceived by much of

the world (but especially by a Christian West responsible for the

worst excesses of anti-Semitism) as a heroic and justified restitution

for what they suffered. Yet, for years and years, few paid attention

to the conquest of Palestine by Jewish forces, or to the Arab people

already there who endured its exorbitant cost in the destruction of

their society, the expulsion of the majority, and the hideous system

of laws -- a virtual Apartheid -- that still discriminates against

them inside Israel and in the occupied territories. Palestinians were

the silent victims of a gross injustice, quickly shuffled offstage by

a triumphalist chorus of how amazing Israel was.

<p>
After the reemergence of a genuine Palestinian liberation movement in

the late '60s, the formerly colonised people of Asia, Africa and Latin

America adopted the Palestinian struggle, but in the main, the

strategic balance was vastly in Israel's favour; it has been backed

unconditionally by the US ($5 billion in annual aid), and in the West,

the media, the liberal intelligentsia, and most governments have been

on Israel's side. For reasons too well known to go into here, the

official Arab environment was either overtly hostile or lukewarm in

its mostly verbal and financial support.

<p>
Because, however, the shifting strategic goals of the PLO were always

clouded by useless terrorist actions, were never addressed or

articulated eloquently, and because the preponderance of cultural

discourse in the West was either unknown to or misunderstood by

Palestinian policymakers and intellectuals, we have never been able to

claim the moral high ground effectively. Israeli information could

always both appeal to (and exploit) the Holocaust as well as the

unstudied and politically untimely acts of Palestinian terror, thereby

neutralising or obscuring our message, such as it was. We never

concentrated as a people on cultural struggle in the West (which the

ANC early on had realised was the key to undermining Apartheid) and we

simply did not highlight in a humane, consistent way the immense

depredations and discriminations directed at us by Israel. Most

television viewers today have no idea about Israel's racist land

policies, or its spoliations, tortures, systematic deprivation of the

Palestinians just because they are not Jews. As a black South African

reporter wrote in one of


the local newspapers here while on a visit to Gaza, Apartheid was

never as vicious and as inhumane as Zionism: ethnic cleansing, daily

humiliations, collective punishment on a vast scale, land

appropriation, etc., etc.
<p>

But, even these facts, were they known better as a weapon in the

battle over values between Zionism and the Palestinians, would not

have been enough. What we never concentrated on enough was the fact

that to counteract Zionist exclusivism, we would have to provide a

solution to the conflict that, in Mandela's second phrase, would

assert our common humanity as Jews and Arabs. Most of us still cannot

accept the idea that Israeli Jews are here to stay, that they will not

go away, any more than Palestinians will go away. This is

understandably very hard for Palestinians to accept, since they are

still in the process of losing their land and being persecuted on a

daily basis. But, with our irresponsible and unreflective suggestion

in what we have said that they will be forced to leave (like the

Crusades), we did not focus enough on ending the military occupation

as a moral imperative or on providing a form for their security and

self-determinism that did not abrogate ours. This, and not the

preposterous hope that a volatile American president would give us a

state, ought to have been the basis of a mass campaign everywhere. Two

people in one land. Or, equality for all. Or, one person one vote. Or,

a common humanity asserted in a binational state.

<p>
I know we are the victims of a terrible conquest, a vicious military

occupation, a Zionist lobby that has consistently lied in order to

turn us either into non-people or into terrorists -- but what is the

real alternative to what I've been suggesting? A military campaign? A

dream. More Oslo negotiations? Clearly not. More loss of life by our

valiant young people, whose leader gives them no help or direction? A

pity, but no. Reliance on the Arab states who have reneged even on

their promise to provide emergency assistance now? Come on, be

serious.

<p>
Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs are locked in Sartre's vision of

hell, that of "other people." There is no escape. Separation can't

work in so tiny a land, any more than Apartheid did. Israeli military

and economic power insulates them from having to face reality. This is

the meaning of Sharon's election, an antediluvian war criminal

summoned out of the mists of time to do what: put the Arabs in their

place? Hopeless. Therefore, it is up to us to provide the answer that

power and paranoia cannot. It isn't enough to speak generally of

peace. One must provide the concrete grounds for it, and those can

only come from moral vision, and neither from "pragmatism" nor

"practicality." If we are all to live -- this is our imperative -- we

must capture the imagination not just of our people, but that of our

oppressors. And, we have to abide by humane democratic values.

<p>
Is the current Palestinian leadership listening? Can it suggest

anything better than this, given its abysmal record in a "peace

process" that has led to the present horrors?
