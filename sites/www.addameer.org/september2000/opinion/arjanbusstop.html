<h3>THE STORY BEHIND A BUS STOP</h3>
<p> 
By Arjan El Fassed
<p> February 15
 


<p>
A Palestinian driver rammed his bus into a packed bus stop 
Wednesday,

killing seven Israeli soldiers and a civilian. It is unfortunately

true that all too often a seeming identification of "terrorism" with

Palestinians has clouded all reasonable discussion, coverage, and

rational thinking about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The myths

and distortions that have been assumed as reality have been

appropriated by one side and cast a shroud around any deeper

understanding of the conflict. The question is: what is the reality

behind what happened at that bus stop?
<p>

The bus stop was located in what Israel calls Azur, an Israeli

settlement established in 1948 on the lands of the Palestinian village

Yazur, 6 kilometers from Jaffa. On the 11 December 1947, Jewish

immigrants launched a terror attack against the Yazur village coffee

house killing six Palestinians. On 30 April 1948, this Palestinian

village was under complete control by Jewish forces and subsequently

cleansed of its more than 4,000 Palestinian inhabitants, now refugees.

The village has been mostly destroyed with the exception of two

village shrines. Two small structures have been converted into

commercial buildings. The site contain modern apartment blocks from

two Israeli settlements, namely Miqwe Yisrael and Azur.

<p>
What explains the Palestinian driver's actions? Khalil Abu Olbeh, the

bus driver, had no ties to any Palestinian faction. This is not

strange. Opinion polls show that since the past few years, most

Palestinians in the Westbank and Gaza have lost their ties with any

factions. According to Abu Olbeh's relatives, Khalil was distraught

over the large number of Palestinian casualties over the past few

months. Between September 28, 2000 and February 13, 2001, 359

Palestinians were killed and eleven Palestinians have been

assassinated of which 89 percent were civilians. In that same period

more than 12,000 Palestinians were injured, including 1,500 with

permanent disabilities.

<p>
Heavy shooting in the southern Gaza Strip the past few days had left

Abu Olbeh particularly aggrieved. But to friends and relatives, his

emotions were in tune with the rest of the neighborhood, and nothing

seemed amiss with the 35-year-old father of five.

<p>
Khalil Abu Olbeh, the father of five, had been driving Palestinian

laborers from Gaza to jobs in Israel for the past five years as an

employee of the Israeli bus company Egged. Abu Olbeh was among 15,000

Palestinians who had been permitted to return to their jobs two weeks

ago after Israel had eased an earlier closure of the Palestinian

areas. He worked as a taxi driver in Gaza, but it brought in little

money.
<p>

For the past four months, Khalil Abu Olbeh had been unemployed because

of Israel's closure of the Palestinian areas, which kept more than

125,000 Palestinians from their jobs in Israel. Israel has tightened

its policy of closures and curfews since September 2000.

<p>
Living conditions have been deteriorating. Before the recent Intifada,

the unemployment rate for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip

was estimated at anywhere between 11 percent and 24 percent. During

the past few months, however, that figure has risen dramatically

because of the estimated 125,000 Palestinians unable to reach their

jobs in Israel. The economic results have been devastating: the

families of these workers now suffer from a complete lack of income,

threatening their ability to sustain themselves. With an unemployment

rate of 38 percent, over 30 percent of the Palestinian population are

living under the poverty level, earning less than $2 a day.
<p>

The impact of these measures on the Palestinian civilian people has

been disastrous. The economic gains Palestinians saw during the first

half of 2000 have been completely erased. Workers have been unable to

reach their jobs in Israel, and are therefore unable to earn money

essential for the well being of their families and central to the

local economy. Industry and agriculture have suffered both in

financial and material terms, and development has all but ceased. An

additional outcome of the closure policy has been the general

inability on many occasions to transfer wounded individuals to and

from hospitals in different locales.

<p>
Many Palestinians seeking medical treatment for chronic conditions and

emergencies have been denied access to hospitals and clinics, either

by being held up at checkpoints for inordinate amounts of time or

because of the siege surrounding many towns and villages in the West

Bank and Gaza Strip. The refusal of the Israeli authorities to comply

with international humanitarian law, specifically the Fourth Geneva

Convention.

<p>
Israeli authorities said they were certain that Abu Olbeh's actions

were deliberate. Perhaps they were, perhaps not. The day before Abu

Olbeh drove his bus into the bus stop packed with Israeli soldiers,

Israeli forces assassinated 50 year-old Mas'oud Ayyad. Elsewhere in

the Gaza Strip, at Netsarim Junction, Israeli soldiers opened fire at

a group of unarmed demonstrators, killing 14 year-old Bilal Tawfiq

Ramadan with a live bullet to the heart, at one point sending a United

Nations mission scurrying for cover as shooting erupted around them

during a visit to a refugee camp. Perhaps a refugee camp hosting the

native inhabitants of the Palestinian village Yazur, who could see

their place of origin in the newspapers, now called Azur.
