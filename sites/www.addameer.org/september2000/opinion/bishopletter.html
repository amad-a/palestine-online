<h3>To the Children of the Palestinian People</h3>

<p> Bishop Hilarion Cappucci<br>
The Bishop of Jerusalem - in Exile<br>
23.10.2000 



<p>In my exile, I am away from you.  But this absence is only physical.  
In my
heart, my thoughts, and my prayers, I am with you all the time.   In 
fact,
I feel much closer to you now, during these difficult moments, than I 
ever
have before.   But I wish I were able to march with you and to be ready 
to
die for you.  It would be an honor for me to die in the battlefield 
because
I know that this is my duty in front of God and my country.

<p>The humanity of a person is glorified at its best in two things only:
First, to stand in solidarity, firm and without any compromise, on the 
side
of the oppressed, the weak and the underprivileged.   Second, to stand
against the oppressors no matter who they are and no matter what the 
cost.
Any other attitude constitutes running away from our responsibility and
washing our hands.  To be silent is a sign of cowardice.  To be silent 
is a
form of approval.

<p>As an Arab and as the Bishop of Jerusalem, my conscience obliges me to
defend my parish and my children.  Enough is enough!  Our patience has
reached its limit.  Our catastrophe has as its cause the international
Zionist movement, an expansionist, imperialist movement, which has made 
our
life miserable since its inception.   Israel is its implementing 
agency. 

<p>Our Palestinian people are living under occupation with no rights and 
no
dignity.  The Palestinian people are strangers in their own country and
prisoners in their own homes.  Israel has stolen our lands and has made 
our
people homeless.  Israel has stolen our rights and has disgraced our
dignity.  Israel has desecrated our holy sites and killed the 
worshippers
at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 

<p>The first and the second Intifada are an expression of the Palestinian 
will
against oppression and occupation, against Israel's denial of our 
rights,
our inalienable rights for self-determination and building a sovereign 
and
free Palestinian state. 

<p>Israel is trying to break our spirit with tanks, helicopters, rockets, 
and
live ammunition.  But while Israel attacks the unarmed heroes of the
stones, these heroes will be victorious in the end, armed as they are 
with
their will and their faith. Tens were killed and thousands injured, and
Israel continues to annihilate us morally and physically.  We are 
fighting
for life.  But life is not merely eating and drinking. Man does not 
live by
bread alone.  Our nourishment is our life, our dignity, and our 
homeland.
This is our only choice and we accept it.  Either we live in dignity in 
our
homes, or we die in dignity defending our rights.  To die a coward 
would be
a shame.

<p>Our mission is to struggle toward a just peace that guarantees for us a
life with dignity in a free, sovereign, and independent homeland.  Its
borders are the borders of 4 June 1967, and Jerusalem is its capital.   
We
are not beggars.  This is our basic  right according to United Nations
resolutions 242 and 338.  Beneath it is a red line because these 
constitute
only 21% of the area of Palestine.

<p>Now, Israel must choose, more than ever before, either peace or the
continuation of occupation. But to enjoy both is impossible because 
these
two options are mutually exclusive.  The language of threats, 
oppression,
closure, siege, and starvation used in order to dictate its policies is
like counterfeit money.  It is useless.  

<p>Our spirits are high and we refuse to be disgraced.  We will not 
surrender
until we raise the Palestinian flag all over our occupied land.  We 
will
not kneel and we will not surrender!

<p>Our martyrs are innocent and our wounded are lighted candles that show 
us
the path on which we must proceed -- the path to return to the Aqsa 
Mosque,
to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, to Palestine.  This path, however, 
is
filled with thorns, filled with sacrifice.  Dawn bursts forth only 
after
the darkness of night.   Revolution can only occur in the womb of 
grief,
just as wheat can only grow when it is buried in the ground.  Its death 
is
its life, its fertility is its resurrection.

<p>Your people are fighting against oppression and tyranny.  The leaders 
of
the Arab World are watching you.  They are calling you in the name of 
God,
in the name of all people who have been killed, in the name of the
thousands who have been wounded, in the name of the courageous and the
heroes.  I call upon you as I remember the crying and the tears of the
orphaned children and the widows.  I call on you to be at your best as 
the
awakening Arab people expect this of you.   Do not let them down. You 
are
their refuge.  Help them to raise their level of ambition to live in
freedom and in dignity.  Help them to find unity among their Arab 
brothers
and sisters.  Strength only comes from solidarity and unity.  God 
cannot
change people unless they attempt to change themselves.  

<p>Make it your priority to stop all forms of normalization and to revive 
and
support a true boycott of Israel.  By doing this, your conscience will
remain clear and history will remember you gratefully.

<p>I send my greetings to all the Arab people who stand in solidarity with 
the
Palestinian people and the Al Aqsa Intifada in order to express their 
anger
and outrage through mass demonstrations.  

<p>I feel very proud and walk tall when I remember the heroes of the 
stones
and all my struggling Palestinian people.  The glory is for you, our 
dear
martyrs.  May you rest in peace.  We will remain faithful on the path
carrying the banner of freedom that you once carried.  We will not let 
it
fall.  We promise to bring this banner to Palestine, to Al Aqsa Mosque, 
to
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, to our Arab Jerusalem, free and the
capital of Palestine.

<p>For God, all things are possible.

basic meaning was kept to the best of my knowledge. (translator's note)
