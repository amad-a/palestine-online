<h3>The Intifada is not a Palestinian picnic<br> Open letter to members of a Jerusalem synagogue</h3>
<p> 
By Hanna Nasir, President of Birzeit University
<p> February 15
 






<p>
I read your call a few days ago in Al Quds newspaper about 
achieving

peace with your Palestinian neighbors. It is no doubt necessary

because all of us in the area are calling for peace. I do not think

there is anyone who does not want to live in peace and tranquility.

The more important question now is how each side understands 
this

peace.
<p>

I understand peace as an end to the conflict between us after we, as

Palestinians, gain our historical rights – at least the rights which

were agreed upon according to legitimate and international

resolutions.
<p>

I am saying these things because I believe that this state of conflict

will continue even after we gain our rights. The effects of the

occupation and the destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure over

more than 50 years is not easily erased by a national reconciliation,

even if this reconciliation is committed to legitimate international

foundations. Historical reconciliation also needs supportive ethical

stances such as an apology and a bearing of the moral and perhaps

material responsibility for what happened. I am not saying this to

complicate matters but rather from my perception of true peace and

from the perspective of permanently and fully ending the conflict.
<p>

I appreciate– as much as a non-Jew could appreciate– the extent of

what you endured at the hands of Nazi Germany and other European

countries. This was no doubt a horrendous crime against humanity. So I

truly understand your continuous pursuit of Nazi war criminals and I

understand that modern Germany would apologize and bear responsibility

for what happened. Naturally, this apology will not erase the effects

of the crimes but it at least alleviated the tragedy and opened the

door to a historical reconciliation between you and Germany.

<p>From the same perspective, we as Palestinians expect Israel to

apologize and

take responsibility for what happened to us. I was relatively young

during the 1948 War but I still fondly remember the Palestinian cities

which I – because of my father’s work – used to travel between such as

“West” Jerusalem, Jaffa, Safad and Ramleh. Now these cities have

become part of Israel. I still painfully remember the Palestinian

cities which I used to visit and which are now completely demolished.

I remember how in 1948 I saw waves of refugees reach my hometown of

Birzeit at nightfall, exhausted and terrified, finding no other

shelter save the sky and the olive tree branches. My experience is

more or less the same of most Palestinians. And you want us to forget

all of this or feign forgetfulness?  Do you want us to forget what

befell the Palestinian people over the past 50 years and how they were

and still are being subjected to continuous attempts to destroy their

infrastructure and their very existence?
<p>

Despite all this, a few years ago we still accepted a conciliatory

solution, which called for an Israeli withdrawal from territories

occupied in 1967 only and for finding a just solution to the problem

of Palestinian refugees in line with international legitimate

resolutions. You no doubt realize that this solution does not grant

the Palestinians more than 22 percent of historical Palestine.

However, the Palestinians’ desire for peace compelled them to accept

this solution – even if grudgingly.

<p>
Then what happened? There were supposed to be negotiations in order to

implement international legitimate resolutions and to develop

procedures to completely end the occupation. A perception of the

relationship between the two peoples and every detail of a historical

reconciliation were also supposed to be formulated. Unfortunately, six

years and more have passed and Israeli forces have not totally

withdrawn. East Jerusalem is no longer ours. Land confiscation and

illegal construction of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land in the

West Bank and Gaza continued.

<p>
I remember how after the 1967 War the Israelis were saying that if the

Pales tinians only acknowledged them they would have realized that in

return, Israel would have offered them much more than they had

imagined. The Palestinians offered this desired recognition as did

some Arab countries. The Palestinians even modified their national

charter – the PLO charter, to affirm that they were interested in

solving the conflict by peaceful means. But despite all this, the

Israeli reactions did not rise to the level of sincerity in dealing

with this historical crossroads. The promised solutions did not come.

On the contrary, the Israeli people became more extreme and obstinate

than ever.
<p>

The current Intifada is a direct and actual result of this Israeli

stance. No people would accept to remain under eternal occupation. We

consider the current positions of the Israeli government insulting

because it boasts that it offered more than any other government in

the way of peace and withdrawal from the occupied territories.

However, everyone knows that what the Israeli government offered is

still much less than the conciliatory solution that the Palestinians

accepted, which is in compliance with international and legitimate

resolutions.
<p>

The new Israeli prime minister-elect has publicly declared that he

would not even accept the positions of the outgoing government. This

in itself totally paralyses the peace process.


The Intifada is not a Palestinian picnic. On average two or three

Palestinians are killed. We would like nothing more than for our

Palestinian blood and Jewish blood, not to be spilled. You call on us

to consider the negotiations as the basis for reaching a solution. You

say that each side must give painful concessions. Just so we do not

get confused with these locutions, I would like to point out that we

agreed to the negotiations and we agreed to painful historical

concessions and we signed agreements with Israeli leaders in this

regard. Do you want us, after all this, to negotiate once again on

what we have already negotiated? Do you want us to concede more of our

historical rights? Is there a reason for this? Is there a reason that

we should concede East Jerusalem? Is there a reason why we should

concede the land which settlers forcefully usurped? Is there a reason

why we should concede the right of refugees to a just settlement for

them and their tragedy?

<p>
It is easy for the party that has claimed a military victory to call

on everyone else to give painful concessions. However a sincere call

must be to accept international and legitimate resolutions as a basis

for ending the conflict, regardless of whether these resolutions are

painful for either side or for both. It is international legitimacy

which guarantees just solutions and adhering to them protects all

parties from the threat of wars and their tragic outcomes.
<p>

At the same time you are directing your call towards the Palestinian

people, I would like for you to direct your pens towards your own

people. Ask them to declare their acceptance of international and

legitimate resolutions without ambiguity or misinterpretations and

their willingness to completely withdraw from the territories occupied

in 1967 including East Jerusalem. Ask them to find a just solution to

the refugee problem. Only then can there be negotiations to overcome

the difficulties and to find practical solutions within a limited

period of time. If not, the struggle will continue to gain our rights.

There is no escape from the liberation of a people, no matter how long

it takes.

<p>
I do not want to end my letter to you on a pessimistic note. I just

want to remind you that historical reconciliation between us is very

close. Despite the violence that has overtaken the region at present,

the opportunity is still there for reconciliation. If Israel abandons

its occupation, expansionist and colonialist ambitions it will find

itself in a true oasis of peace which it would be able to protect more

than all of its settlers and settlements or than its mighty army.
