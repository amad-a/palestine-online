<p>OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL CO-ORDINATOR

<p>The Impact on the Palestinian Economy of the Recent Confrontations,
Mobility Restrictions and Border Closures,
28 September - 19 October 2000

<p>I.  Introduction

<p>The recent crisis has entailed - in addition to the death or injury of
thousands of Palestinians, and several Israelis?serious impediments to
personal and vehicular mobility between the West Bank and Gaza and 
between
the Occupied Palestinian Territory as a whole and Israel and the rest 
of
the world.  Furthermore, there have been obstacles to mobility between
cities, towns and villages in both the West Bank and Gaza. These were 
due
to reduced levels of security on roads between Palestinian population
centers, the imposition of strict internal and comprehensive border
closures by the Israeli authorities (including the placing of physical
barriers between Palestinian villages and cities), and to the work
interruptions in the Palestinian Territory.  The political strife has
resulted in significant losses for the Palestinian economy.  The 
present
report seeks to quantify the losses incurred during the last three 
weeks.

<p>II.  Internal Impact

<p>Since 29 September, travel between the different areas inside the
Palestinian Territory (PT) has been severely hindered by confrontations 
as
well as roadblocks and checkpoints established by the Israeli 
authorities.
The main economic impact of such mobility restrictions has been the
disruption of productive activities and the internal circulation of 
goods.
The short-term losses in such a situation are difficult to measure.  
But
they include reduced income to workers, farmers and business people who
cannot reach their places of employment in the PT and the reduced 
output
and revenues for commercial and business enterprises which are unable 
to
obtain inputs and/or access output markets.  Moreover, the uncertain
security situation has reduced tourist-generated income.  As the crisis
persisted, the extent of these types of losses became more pronounced.
An approximate measure of the internal effects of such disruptions can 
be
derived from estimates of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?i.e. the 
value
of goods and services produced in the Palestinian economy.  The value 
of
the GDP is expected to reach about USD 5,000 million this year while 
the
average work year in the Palestinian Territory is about 312 days.  This
results in an estimated average domestic product of about USD 16 
million
for each normal working day.[1]  Assuming that recent 
events
have resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in normal economic activity, 
the
losses are estimated at about USD 8 million for each normal working day
during the period 30 September - 19 October. [2]

<p>III.  External Impact

<p>A.     Labour Flows and Wage Income

<p>In addition to the internal losses, the border closures have
effectively halted the outward flow of Palestinian labour.  In the 
first
half of 2000, there was an average of about 125,000 Palestinians 
employed
in Israel and Israeli settlements and industrial zones on a daily 
basis..
The average worker was earning a daily wage of about NIS 110 or about 
USD
27.50.  As a group, these workers were earning approximately USD 3.4
million each day.

<p>The first three days of confrontations, i.e. 28-30 September,
and the general strike called in the PT on 30 September, occurred 
during
the weekend and the beginning of the two-day Jewish holiday Rosh Ha 
Shana
(Saturday, 30 September-Sunday, 1 October).  These are normally times 
of
drastically reduced labour flows between the PT and Israel and, thus,
estimated losses are not significant.

<p>Losses began to be incurred on Monday, 2 October when daily
Palestinian labour flows to Israel dropped precipitously.  During 2-5
October, just before the weekend (6-7 October) and the closing of the
border for the Yom Kippur holiday (8-9 October), average daily labour 
flows
to Israel were estimated to have declined by 53 per cent as compared to 
the
week prior to the disturbances.  This resulted in an average daily loss 
of
about USD 1.8 million in direct household income for Palestinians 
during
that period.  The border closure imposed on Monday, 9 October, however,
resulted in an almost complete cessation of labour flows and an 
estimated
USD 3.4 million loss for each normal working day thereafter.

<p>B. Commodity Flows and External Trade Income

<p>In addition, exports from Gaza have been effectively blocked
since the closing of the border at the beginning of the Rosh Ha Shana
holiday (30 September-1 October).  Exports from the West Bank have also
been severely constrained during this period. [3]  Total 
registered
Palestinian non-agricultural exports to Israel (the main market for
Palestinian exporters) averaged about USD 45.1 million per month during 
the
first half of 2000.  Assuming that these sales are distributed evenly
throughout the working year, this implies a daily loss of about USD 1.9
million in exports, although some portion of these losses can be 
retrieved
once mobility restrictions are removed.[4]

<p>Palestinian imports from Israel have also been negatively
affected by the border closures mobility restrictions.  The commercial
crossings in Gaza have been closed since Saturday, 30 September 
resulting
in a complete halt to goods imports.  Trade between Israel and the West
Bank has been severely restricted as well.  Registered non-agricultural
imports from Israel averaged USD 135.9 million per month in the first 
half
of 2000 or about USD 5.9 million each working day.  Furthermore, direct
Palestinian imports from abroad averaged about USD 3.1 million per day 
in
the first half of the year. [5]

<p>External trade is an integral component of the Palestinian
economy and has important effects on the size of the GDP.  Exports
contribute to domestic production and income-generation while many 
imported
goods are used as inputs in domestic production.  Likewise, the 
inability
to export dampens domestic production while a lack of imported raw
materials and other inputs creates production stoppages for those
businesses and farmers who rely on Israeli or foreign-produced inputs.
However, since external (and internal) trade activities are already
factored into the calculation of GDP, the trade losses resulting from
border closures and movement restrictions are included in the estimated
daily GDP losses noted above.[6]

<p>IV.  Destruction of Physical Assets

<p>There has also been the physical destruction of private and public
assets?buildings, orchards and vehicles?due to the conflict.  The 
material
losses have been caused by Israel's use of heavy weapons, including 
rocket
fire, against numerous buildings and vehicles and the destruction of 
fruit
orchards near flash points in the PT.  Israeli settlers have also 
engaged
in the destruction of private property such as numerous Palestinian 
trucks
used to transport goods to and from Gaza which were located in car 
parks
under Israeli control.[7]  While the value of such losses is
difficult to calculate, it is almost certainly in the millions of USD.

<p>V. Aggregate Economic Losses

<p>The estimated economic losses are detailed in Table 1.
Excluding material damage to physical assets, and in the aggregate, the
losses to the Palestinian economy are estimated at USD 186.2 million 
during
the 22-day period 28 September - 19 October.  These losses exceed the 
value
of donor disbursements to the PA during the first half of the year, 
which
were USD 183 million. [8]  If these losses are distributed over 
the
normal working days in the Palestinian Territory?of which there were 
19?the
average daily loss is estimated at about USD 9.8 million.

<p>Table 1<br>
Estimates of Short-Term Economic Losses in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, 28 September - 19 October, 2000

<p>Sources&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       Losses
(USD)
<p>1. Domestic Output and Income&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  148,000,000

<p>2. Labour Income from Israel   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38,205,750

<p>Total  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  186,205,750

<p>As indicated in Table 1, these losses consist of: 1) the dampening 
effects
on the production and circulation of goods (inputs and outputs) and
services in the PT estimated at USD 148.0 million.  These include 
losses
incurred due to impediments to internal and external trade; 2) the 
labour
income lost by workers (and their households) due to their inability to
reach job sites in Israel and Israeli settlements and industrial zones.
This loss is estimated at USD 38.2 million.  While lost labour income 
is
irretrievable, some of the domestic output/income losses may be 
recuperated
once internal and external trade resumes.

<p>VI. Losses to the Public Sector

<p>There have also been losses to the public sector in the form of lost
domestic, customs and VAT revenues.  These, however, are difficult to
quantify as data for the year 2000 have yet to be issued. Most of the
losses in revenues related to external trade?the main source of 
short-term
fiscal losses?can be recuperated once the border closures are lifted 
and
trade resumes.

<p>It is also the case that certain public agencies?the PA Ministry of
Health in particular?have had to vastly increase the level of spending 
to
cope with the large number of killed and wounded Palestinians.  This 
has
imposed added costs, some of which have been covered by emergency
assistance provided by donor agencies and NGOs (facilitated by the 
creation
of a Humanitarian Task Force for Emergency Needs, under UNSCO
chairmanship.)  Such assistance has been partly facilitated by eased
restrictions on the movement of emergency care vehicles, workers and
medical supplies.  Restrictions were eased beginning on 14 October
following the direct intervention of the United Nations 
Secretary-General.
 [10]

<p>Moreover, some PA agencies have been closed for most of this
period as many employees have been unable to reach their jobs due to
internal closures imposed by the Israeli authorities.  This has meant
reduced public services and disruptions in capacity-building and
institutional development programmes and projects, many of which are
supported from donor and multi-lateral sources.  Likewise, the crisis 
has
resulted in a near halt to infrastructural development projects - most of
which are donor financed - due to the lack of security, the evacuation of
project personnel and to the lack of some materials.[11]

<p>VII. Longer Term Impact

<p>One immediate effect of the comprehensive and internal border
closures imposed on the PT is the disemployment of some 125,000 workers
formerly employed in Israel.  This has temporarily raised the core
unemployment rate from about 11 per cent in the first half of 2000 to
nearly 30 per cent. If such a situation
persists, the decline in household incomes will have the secondary 
effect
of reducing domestic purchases of goods and services and thereby 
further
lower income and employment (a reverse multiplier effect).  Rates of
poverty will also increase, requiring the PA to raise spending on 
social
assistance at a time when its revenue base is being eroded.  This would
adversely affect fiscal conditions.

<p>Another indirect and lagged cost of the strife is the increased
perception of political risk on the part of domestic and foreign
investors?both current and potential. The PT (and Israel) will be seen 
as a
riskier place to invest for the long term.  This can threaten the 
short-
and long-term growth of the Palestinian (and Israeli) economy and 
reduce
the rate of income and employment growth.

<p>As a result of the Sharm Al Sheikh Summit which ended on 17
October, there has been a reduction in confrontations and an easing of
internal movement restrictions in the PT.  Should this continue in the
coming days, the Palestinian economy may yet resume the significant
recovery witnessed over the last 3 years, which has reduced 
unemployment
rates from about 25 per cent in 1996 to about 11 per cent in the first 
half
of 2000.  Moreover, the normalisation of labour and especially trade 
flows
will allow the Palestinian private and public sectors to recuperate 
some
portion of the significant losses incurred in the past three weeks.
Gaza, 19 October 2000

<p> [1] The GDP estimate is based on Palestinian Central Bureau of 
Statistics
(PCBS) National Accounts in Current Prices 1998, December 1999 (in 
Arabic)
with PA Ministry of Finance and IMF real growth estimates for 1999 and
2000.  Estimates include East Jerusalem and are expressed in 1998 
constant
prices.  The normal work year in the Palestinian Territory excludes 
Fridays
(the weekend) and the two key Muslim holidays - Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al 
Adha.
<p>[2] This estimate is based on the observation that the key branches in 
the
Palestinian economy - services (both public and private), internal and
external commerce and construction?which collectively account for more 
than
three-quarters of the GDP - have been disproportionately affected by work
interruptions.  Since internal and external commerce are components of 
the
GDP, lost or delayed export and import opportunities are already 
factored
into the estimated losses.  See below.  The estimated losses for 29
September are 25 per cent of the average daily GDP or USD 4 million.
<p>[3] The Allenby/Karameh bridge to Jordan was open, except for the Yom
Kippur holidays, until Friday, 13 October when it was closed.  
Information
and assistance provided by the Palestinian crossing authorities, 
October
2000.  Movement restrictions were made more severe by the closing of 
the
Gaza International Airport on Sunday, 8 October.  The airport was 
re-opened
on 19 October.
<p>[4] Economic interactions between the Palestinian and Israeli economies
take place on an average of 277 working days each year (i.e. calendar 
days
minus Muslim and Jewish holidays and weekends)--about 23 days each 
month.
The export losses are underestimated since they exclude the significant
amount of unregistered West Bank exports to Israel, Palestinian exports 
to
third countries and Palestinian agricultural exports (which are not 
subject
to VAT).  Agricultural exports average about USD 150,000 per day 
according
to the Ministry of Agriculture, Ramallah, 17 October 2000.
<p>[5] Data on the value of external trade is from the Palestinian 
Ministry of
Finance, September 2000.
<p>[6] It should be noted that, except for perishable agricultural
commodities, part of the trade-related losses will be recuperated once
mobility restrictions are lifted.

"Quarterly
Monitoring Report of Donor Assistance," 230 June 2000.

while
those related to transactions with Israel are based on a 5.5-day work 
week.

of
Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem.

Reports in the press suggest that the Israeli authorities have ordered 
a
halt to cement and construction material shipments related to the Gaza 
port
and Gaza power station projects during the early days of the 
confrontation.
