<h3>The Palestinian Position Regarding Clinton's Proposals</h3>
<p> Akram Haniyya
<p> <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) <br>
  
  <br>
  Washington - Arafat's advisor and chief editor of the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam, 
  Akram Haniyya, who participated in the Camp David negotiations, published an 
  editorial titled &quot;American Fast Food,&quot; in which he effectively rejects 
  Clinton's proposals. (1) Following is a <br>
  full translation of the editorial: </p>
<p>&quot;The phone lines in the headquarters of the [Palestinian] presidency are 
  likely to be subjected to massive pressure in the coming days. Dozens of phone 
  calls from many capitals in the world are expected. Although the Muslim and 
  Christian holidays occur simultaneously this year, the White House has declared 
  high alert and delivered a message to dozens of capitals in all continents to 
  contact [the PA] immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;The content of this message may be summarized in one single sentence: 
  Significant progress has been achieved, allowing for a historic opportunity 
  to reach an agreement on a final settlement between the Israeli and Palestinian 
  parties. The initiative demanded [of world leaders] may also be summarized in 
  one single sentence: Call the Palestinian leadership in order to persuade it 
  to accept the proposed [American] ideas.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The scale of American-Israeli media activity and diplomatic urgency in 
  the last couple of weeks almost succeeded in creating the impression that there 
  is a genuine opportunity (the <br>
  anticipation for which has lasted for a century) to establish a just and lasting 
  peace settlement for the conflict. The impression created is that the issues 
  of the negotiations have completely ripened and that nothing remained but some 
  final touches, to be accomplished prior to the signing ceremony, that should 
  take place before the final curtain of Bill Clinton's presidential term on January 
  20, 2001.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;We know very well that in the coming two weeks we are likely to 
  hear the same old tune: 'don't miss the train;' 'take the opportunity before 
  January 20 and before February 6' (the date for the Israeli premiership elections).&quot; 
</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, the following three points should be made right from the beginning: 
  A) There is a Palestinian will to reach a peace agreement that will fulfill 
  the Palestinian rights today rather than tomorrow. The Palestinian leadership 
  understands very well the various aspects of the constitutional considerations 
  in both the US and Israel. Therefore, no serious opportunity should be missed 
  and no spark of hope should be left unexamined. However, it must be <br>
  stressed at this point that the Palestinian decision is guided only by the compass 
  of the supreme national interests of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian 
  timeline is determined, first and foremost, by this compass.</p>
<p> B) The continuous Palestinian declarations that any possible agreement must 
  conform to the resolutions of international legitimacy are a fundamental and 
  essential matter, not a product for media consumption. Therefore, it is unacceptable 
  that [these] resolutions, which are the source of authority for the peace process, 
  become mere slogans or preambles to agreements whose articles and detailed appendices 
  negate the goal and essence [of the resolutions of international legitimacy 
  themselves], distort their wording, and rob <br>
  them of their spirit. C) From the Palestinian perspective, what is needed is 
  a final settlement that will truly have the 'quality of finality. ' In other 
  words, only an agreement that determines all the minute details [and includes] 
  full maps - an agreement that does not require dozens of additional future agreements 
  for its implementation and does not conceal breaches or mines - may be signed. 
  The bitter experience of the last seven years of the negotiating process <br>
  necessitates that any final agreement indeed be final.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;In view of these three criteria, [it is worth asking] whether the 
  ideas read by President Clinton - who these days is packing up to leave - to 
  the Palestinian and Israeli delegations last Saturday in the Oval Office, truly 
  present new windows to a solution.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Do the media turmoil and diplomatic urgency actually reflect a good opportunity? 
  Or do they perhaps reflect a Democratic President's ambition to reach an agreement 
  that will become part of his legacy a legacy that is now threatened by a Republican 
  president-elect and by the first signs of a slowdown [in the American economy] 
  that may hurt his main source of pride: the greatest period of economic prosperity 
  since WWII?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Is this the marketing of an historic settlement to peoples who 
  yearn for peace and for salvation from wars and destruction, or is it merely 
  a recruitment for a campaign to reelect Barak as Prime Minister?&quot; &quot;An 
  objective reading of the American ideas uncovers some significant facts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;A) The [American] ideas ignore the most important lesson of both the 
  Camp David summit and the Intifada, because they include a recognition of Israeli 
  sovereignty over what is underneath the Al-Haram Al-Sharif. Thus, these ideas 
  feed the fire and threaten to encourage religious wars. All this despite the 
  fact that any objective observer should have realized, following the events 
  of recent months, what Al-Aqsa and Jerusalem mean to the Arabs - Muslims and 
  Christians alike. </p>
<p>B) Clinton's ideas contradict the resolutions of international legitimacy in 
  several points. They violate Resolutions 242 and 338 by legitimating the Israeli 
  settlements. Thus, they approve the annexation of Palestinian lands to Israel 
  without offering a substitute, equal in both value and size, of Israeli lands 
  [that will be transferred to Palestinian sovereignty]. In addition, they propose 
  mechanisms for solving the Refugee Problem - the heart of the <br>
  Palestinian problem - that negate the wording of Resolution 194 regarding their 
  return to their homes. They propose instead the options of re- settlement of 
  refugees, return to the Palestinian state, immigration to other countries, or 
  compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;C) The American ideas as a whole constitute more than a declaration of 
  principles and less than a framework agreement for a final accord. They [cover 
  the issues] like a broad cloak, but create more questions than answers. They 
  include ideas and principles that will require <br>
  dozens of additional agreements to be implemented. Anyone who recalls that it 
  took ten months of hard negotiations to reach an agreement about Al-Shuhadaa 
  Street in Hebron (an agreement that has not yet been implemented), can imagine 
  how many months or even years it will take to agree on the maps that result 
  from Clinton's ideas regarding places that are in between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods 
  in Jerusalem, or areas that are in between settlements that are proposed to 
  remain [under Israeli sovereignty] and the adjacent cities and villages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;D) <br>
  While the American ideas clearly and decisively include all that is vital for 
  Israel - they lack all that is vital for the Palestinians. While the [American] 
  ideas demand taking the precious card of 'ending the conflict' from the Palestinian 
  hand, they do not give [the Palestinians] final answers regarding the final 
  borders of the Palestinian state, because this question is [delayed] for discussion 
  in the map-drawing negotiations. In other words, Israel wins the <br>
  'final' with regards to the solution [of its problems], while the Palestinian 
  side is expected to be satisfied with the 'temporary,' the 'delayed,' and the 
  'pending further negotiations,' after having given up its precious cards and 
  having signed [the agreement] with its golden seal. &quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;In addition, if we try to find out the philosophy underlying these 
  ideas, we can easily see that the American administration is asfaithful as ever 
  before to Israeli priorities and demands. At the same time, it disregards the 
  Palestinian priorities. Furthermore, the security articles included in the [American] 
  ideas negate the sovereignty of the Palestinian state and are detrimental to 
  its relations with its Arab neighbors. Also, the ideas entail a naive <br>
  attempt to deny the centrality of the Refugee Problem which is the most visible 
  manifestation of the Nakbah and the Palestinian Problem.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, it turns out that the American ideas lack the vital lessons 
  of the Intifada, especially in all that concerns the existence of the settlements 
  as a substantial danger for the peace.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The American President-elect, George Bush, justifiably warned in his 
  campaign [warn] of subordinating the peace process to the domesti American timetable. 
  Therefore, the American peace team should have learned the lesson of recent 
  years and given the President advice that can meet the requirements of a just 
  peace and can be in line with the <br>
  source of authority that was set by Washington [itself] for the peace process. 
  However, it seems that &quot;the final shot&quot; of this team, just like its 
  previous shots, is not capable of hitting the desired target, due to structural 
  problems [in the American peace team].&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;The Palestinian problem is too big for a solution to be 'cooked 
  up' in a few days without taking into consideration what is necessary in order 
  to acheive success and durability of a solution. The solution [that President 
  Clinton proposes] is in the style of American fast food. <br>
  Despite its attractive wrapping, it is not 'healthy food,' and is, in fact, 
  'indigestible' in the Middle East.'</p>
