<h3>Yesterday's Man</h3>
<p>  By Dr. Hanan Ashrawi
<p>11 February 2001


<p>
      From: The Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of

Global Dialogue and Democracy (MIFTAH) http://www.miftah.org






<p>Jerusalem, February 7, 2001

<p>
Disillusioned with Barak's inconsistencies, angered by his unfulfilled

promises, enraged at his insensitivity and high-handed style of

decision-making, the Israeli public looked elsewhere for salvation.
<p>

Barak had set himself up for the great fall by repeatedly pledging to

accomplish the impossible: He sought to make peace with his

Palestinian victims while pursuing the policies and measures of the

military occupier; he separated the "process" from its substance and

application; he promised to deliver security to each Israeli while

relentlessly battering the Palestinian people; he reinvented the peace

process to comply with illegal Israeli facts on the ground rather than

complying with the legal requirements of peace; he pursued a policy

designed to bring about his peace partners' destruction rather than

their empowerment.
<p>

Barak also tried to be all things to all people, thus managing to

activate a self-destruct mechanism whereby each component neutralized

the other-the settler camp vs. the peace camp, religious

fundamentalists vs. secularists, rightists vs. leftists, ethnic groups

vs. other special interests, Israeli Jews vs. Israeli Arabs, military

vs. political institutions. Ultimately, he failed to deliver.

<p>
While it may be convenient for the disillusioned public (and the

Western press) to blame the Palestinians for Barak's downfall, Israel

has to look within-to search its soul, so to speak-for the causes of

its recurrent political crises. The fact that a third candidate (the

dovish Shimon Peres) could have defeated Sharon is sufficient to

expose the fallacy of finding an external (Palestinian) scapegoat.

<p>
So long as the Israeli political leadership continues to attempt the

impossible-to promise the Israelis security without peace or peace

without fairness or "separation" without full withdrawal or

Palestinian docility without sovereignty or statehood without

Jerusalem or "ending the conflict" without the right of return-the

domestic crises within Israel will persist.

<p>
Regardless of the flip-flopping, no government will enjoy stability or

longevity until it comes to grips with the real requirements of peace

while shedding the mentality of occupation and violence.

<p>
Having come face to face with the substance of the agenda on final

status, the Israelis balked.

<p>
Instead of forging ahead boldly and decisively, grasping the real

opportunity for a historical peace, they decided to step back into the

darkest period of their history.

<p>
Fear remains a powerful negative motivation, and as such has been

successfully fuelled, fed and exploited by the most extreme right wing

governments and individuals in Israel.
<p>

In a knee-jerk, visceral reaction to this latest crisis, the Israeli

body politic groped into its past and came up with a regressive

anachronistic, though familiar, escape: unbridled brutality and

violence on the rampage personified in the figure of Ariel Sharon (see

Key Issues, "The Sharon Factor").

<p>
The euphoria of victory should not blind the Sharon camp to the

underlying reality of the overwhelming protest vote as expressed by a

resounding defeat for Barak-the inevitable outcome of a familiar

hubris.

<p>
Seeking the safety of the familiar, though repugnant, refuge is a

temporary recourse.

<p>
Now that a "reinvented" Sharon has been pulled out, dusted, polished,

and displayed, it is time to begin thinking of the post-Sharon era.

<p>
At best, this is a temporary lapse that is best left behind as soon as

possible.


<p>At worst, Sharon (and what he stands for) may do irreparable damage to

the long-term prospects of peace by reviving the conflicts and bloody

legacy of the past.


<p>Yesterday's man has already left a shameful imprint on Israel's past

and has indelibly marred the collective memory of the peoples of the

region.


<p>Today is the right time for the peace camp in Israel to begin a

process of genuine soul searching and remobilization. The mistakes and

horrors of the past must not be allowed to repeat themselves.


<p>The future is in need of the women and men of tomorrow.
