<h3>Long Walk to Freedom</h3>
<p>  By Juman Odeh MD, MPH<br> 
The Director of the Palestinian Happy Child Center 




<p> 


From the minute I was born, I was told, then taught, that my name is 
Jumana 
Odeh from Lifta. At first I thought Lifta was a member of my family! I 
was confused over this, thinking: "but I was born in Jerusalem and 
raised in Ramallah, so why don't I say : I'm from Ramallah?" Then one 
day my Dad took us to a frontier village near Jerusalem to show us 
Lifta, his village, where he was born as well as his great-great-great 
grandfather. I found out that there was a meaning to "Lifta". It 
simply meant "the homeland" to my Dad. For me Lifta became a nice 
dream. It meant "Home with an almond tree"…next to a busy street full 
of cars. Lifta is located on the Jerusalem - Tel Aviv highway. One day 
I visited Lebanon with my father and I saw the sea for the first time 
in my life, so I began dreaming that one day, my beautiful Lifta would 
move in one of the many cars that I saw and go to the sea shore. I was 
11 years old in 1967 when I heard my Dad saying : "No, I'm not going 
to leave my home again, one time was enough to be uprooted from my 
land, I'll die here…" I can't forget those moments when the Israeli 
army occupied Ramallah and I was hiding with my brothers and sisters 
under the beds waiting until we all would die under the heavy Israeli 
fire… 

<p> I tried after that to live a "normal" life with my family, to go to 
school, play, dance my favorite Dabkeh and dream of a better life. I 
was still 12 when for the first time I participated in a demonstration 
against the Israeli occupation and I cannot to this very moment forget 
the pain I felt when a soldier beat me until I lost consciousness. It 
took me a long time to realize why that soldier had beaten me so 
harshly. My small heart, full of the love and forgiveness with which 
my parents and grandparents had raised me, could not understand why. 
After all, I had done nothing except peacefully to say: "I don't want 
you here on my land." 

<p> When I was 18 I left my country alone on a scholarship to study 
medicine abroad. I used to go and come via the bridge to Jordan and 
each and every time I crossed the bridge I felt the humiliation that 
the Israeli occupiers used against us Palestinians. Each time I came 
home I was challenged by the Israeli soldiers, each time I was kept 
for many hours, just like many other students and young people, and 
asked lots of questions about my study, about my friends and about my 
political views. My answer was each time very simple, that I love 
freedom, I hate the occupiers and this is my political view. Once I 
was interrogated because I was reading a book while waiting for my 
turn to go through. I was stopped for 2 hours just because I was 
reading; the book was a novel by Nagib Mahfouz. I also remember the 
time Shmuel, an Israeli soldier on the Allenby bridge who gave me some 
cold water to drink after I had been interrogated for 3 hours, was 
punished for it by his commander who had seen him. 

<p> I graduated from medical school to become a young physician and 
started working in our hospitals and learning what medical schools 
couldn't teach us, what it means to work under military occupation, to 
feel so frustrated that you are running out of alcohol or cotton or 
bandages or essential antibiotics for your dying baby patient. Or to 
be faced by injured youth when you are not trained to deal with "war 
casualties". I learned, as did any of my other colleagues, the real 
meaning of health in its social, economic, human, psychological and 
political dimensions. 

<p> Still I had a space for " the other". I was on call in the emergency 
room when casualties from a traffic accident arrived at the hospital. 
I can still hear the voice of the Israeli settler mother calling for 
her "tinok" (meaning baby in Hebrew). I was in tears and I fetched her 
baby, and brought it to a semiconscious mother to tell her that her 
baby was safe. I kept the baby with me until an Israeli ambulance came 
to pick up the casualties. And again, I can't forget his eyes, calling 
for help. He was a young Israeli soldier who had run away from the 
middle of the confrontation: Palestinian youths throwing stones at 
Israeli soldiers and getting shot. This soldier was injured. I treated 
him and helped him to escape to a safe area: I saved his life. I have 
no regrets. 

<p> Still I had space for the other. I always tried to see the other side 
of each and every Israeli that I met, including the Israeli soldiers 
on the many checkpoints through which I had to go through four or five 
times a day, on my way to work as a pediatrician in the West Bank, 
East Jerusalem or Gaza. I even tried to learn more about the Israeli 
people, their culture, their religion and their language. And I made 
some Israeli friends. 

<p> To know what it means to live under occupation, you have to go through 
it, you have to live the occupation. It means to be humiliated and 
harassed every minute. Your water, your electricity, your economy, 
your freedom to move around, your freedom to express yourself and your 
land all are controlled by a foreign military force. To live under 
occupation means to leave your home to work, not knowing if you'll 
come back or not, it means that your children go to school and you 
don't know if you will see them again or not. You ingest the 
occupation in the oxygen that you breathe, the water that you drink, 
the food that you eat, and the news that you read or watch at the end 
of the day. I tried my best, not to accept but rather to try to live 
with it, to adapt to it and find ways to live a "normal life", like 
people all over the world do. I wanted to live in peace with myself 
and with my family , and to be honest with my daughters. I even tried 
to explain to my daughters, when they asked me why an Israeli soldier 
had killed our cousin Fadi in 1994, that we are in crisis and that the 
16 year-old Fadi had been killed by a crazy Israeli individual. 


<p> Yes, I tried to be myself and live to love rather than to hate. But to 
see the 12 year-old Mohammad al-Durra being killed in cold blood! And 
to read that general Mofaz, the educated, civilized, democratic 
father, thinks that Mohammad had been participating in demonstrations 
against the occupiers before, that is to say, when he was 7 years old, 
and so Mohammad deserved to die! And Sarrah, not yet two year- old 
Sarrah, killed by an Israeli settler! Why? And what should I tell my 
daughters, when they ask me "Mom can you protect us, Mohammed's father 
and Sarrah's father couldn't protect them!" Or when Ramallah was 
bombed by helicopters and my daughters with their schoolmates 
witnessed all that and were terrified, or when my 16 year-old daughter 
Dana tells me: " No, Mom, I'll never leave my home again", because she 
and her sister had been taken by their grandparents 
to stay with them and be with their cousins in a safe place after the 
bombing of Ramallah? And she says: "I would like to ask those 
soldiers, why do you kill children? Can you go to sleep after that ? 
Don't you have children? If they ask you: where have you been, do you 
tell them that you were involved in killing Sarrah, Mohammad, Nizar 
and many other kids? Don't you think that all of those kids have 
mothers and fathers just like you and they want to be hugged and be 
loved, exactly as you and your kids do?" Or when my 11 year-old 
daughter Tala asked me: "Why, Mommy, do settlers shoot at us every 
night? Why do they start so late at night? I'm scared. Why do they 
kill children?" And it's true, there are some settlers living in a 
settlement at the edge of Ramallah, and they begin shooting every 
night at 30,000 people in Ramallah and El Bireh. What do they want 
from us? I believe that the message we are being sent from all that 
is: shut up, you sub-humans! It is a case of power over justice, over 
humanity and over peace, of arrogance against civilization. 

<p> This is what an analysis of casualty figures and types of injuries, 
after three weeks of the current uprising, have yielded: 8% of the 
all martyrs are children; 10% of the wounded are children; on one 
single day, October 23, 2000, 15% of those wounded died; the overall 
percentage of wounds to the upper parts of the body (heart and head) 
was initially 50,2%, and has gone up to 83.2 % in the later period; 
the use of live ammunition has gone from 20,2% to 57,7%, and now to 
82%; 44% of casualties are now injured in the chest and 43% in the 
head (for a combined total of 87%); 18% of all wounded are in a state 
of clinical death, critically wounded, paraplegic or quadraplegic. 20% 
of all the wounded are likely to remain saddled with a permanent 
disability; the average age of all martyrs or wounded persons is 21 
years. These are the statistics which lie behind my daughters' fears 
and my own shifting convictions regarding Israeli intentions, and the 
collective state of Israeli mental health. And the psychological scars 
our people will endure from the present slaughter are incalculable: 
what is to happen to our entire society? These figures speak 
eloquently of their desire to kill Palestinians, in large numbers. I 
hear behind the din of these cold statistics and of my daughters' 
cries, the echo of Mohammad al Durra's voice, asking for protection 
for our people in the 21st century; this plea must be heeded by all 
those who still believe in humanity. 

<p>On the other side, it is clear that the Israeli military institution 
is building a sick society, and that they will be faced by a whole 
generation of psychologically ill people. This is the fate of children 
and youth who are only taught to speak the language of power and of 
violence. And finally: I am left with no answer to the many questions 
from my daughters, to the call of the statistics, to the plea from 
Mohammed, except that: we are freedom fighters.
