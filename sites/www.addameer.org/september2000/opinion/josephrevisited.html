<h3>Joseph Revisted </h3>
<p>Israel Shamir
<p> 



The author, Israel Shamir, is one of best-known and most respected
Russian Israeli writers and journalists. He wrote for Haaretz, BBC,
Pravda and translated Agnon, Joyce and Homer into Russian. He lives in
Tel Aviv and writes a weekly column in the Vesti, the biggest
Russian-language paper in Israel.

It is not easy to visit Joseph these days. Roadblocks manned by
nervous Israeli soldiers have surrounded his city of Nablus;
trenches or heaps of earth block the smallest entrances and
exits. On a normal morning, commuters pour in from nearby
villages for work or shopping; now they do so at their own peril, and
the local citizens venture out of their homes at the risk of their
lives, as the soldiers shoot without warning. Still, one can sneak
into the old capital of Samaria by foot.
<p>
The city rests as the sachet of myrrh between the twin breasts of Mt
Ebal and Mt Gerizim. Nablus is Neapolis of old, founded by Titus
Flavius in the heyday of the Roman Empire. The Roman traditions did
not die in this Palestinian San Francisco with its lavish Turkish
baths. It is also famous for the fragrant olive soap, spicy kubbeh
soup, and hardy spirit of its inhabitants. They fielded a strong
guerrilla force against Napoleon, rebelled against Egyptian invaders,
and kept the Jewish settlers at bay. During the last uprising, Nablus
gained renown as Jabal an-Nar, the Mount of Fire. Israelis rarely
dared to enter the narrow streets of its old city. Today, this defiant
ancient city is the home of Marwan Barghouti, sometimes credited with
the leadership of the uprising.
<p>
I came here to visit one of the most charming shrines of the Holy
Land, the Tomb of Joseph, the hero of Bible and Koran stories, a local
lad who 'made it' in Egypt and was brought back by Banu Israel to be
buried in his ancestral home. The locals have venerated it, as
numerous other shrines and tombs that adorn the hilltops and
crossroads of Palestine. The shrines have deep roots in the
Palestinian soul; they predate all modern faiths, survived all
religious reforms, and still are able to turn a man to God.
<p>
One needs to take their names with a grain of salt, as they
change with the passage of time. There are a dozen tombs for
Sheikh Ali, and even Joshua bin Nun has quite a few. Other tombs
have multiple names, like the cave on the Mt Olives, called
Pelagia by Christians, Rabia al-Adawiya by Moslems and Hulda by
Jews. While some orthodox Moslem, Christian and Jewish clerics
object to venerating shrines, the common people still come to
beseech for favours, men for glory and harvest, women for
children and love. The tomb of Joseph is no exception. It is a
simple domed building, recently
refurbished, standing next to the ancient mound of Shechem. On
any given day, Palestinian peasant women in black dresses with
rich embroidery can be seen paying their respects at the tomb of
the chaste lover, whose long eyelashes reduced the fortress of
Zuleika's heart.
<p>
A few months ago, Joseph's tomb was all over the news. The people of
Nablus fought well-armed Israeli soldiers over the remains of their
ancestor Joseph, as Achaeans fought Trojans for the body of Patrocles.
Some two score Palestinians died there, Israelis lost one mercenary
and a few were wounded. The pictures of the gun battle were
transmitted around the globe, as firefights raged, ambulances raced to
hospitals and morgues, heavy machinegun bursts tore at stones and
flesh. The virtual reality of TV screens accompanied by the voices of
the experts presented the ultimate proof of Arab hate for Jewish holy
places.
<p>
The tale of the Tomb's destruction remained in the news for long
time. An important Muslim divine from Russia was angry enough to
write an open letter to the Palestinians, condemning the
sacrilege. Main international newspapers
unleashed harsh editorials on the subject. A visiting Martian
would have presumed that the main desire of Palestinians is to go
about desecrating holy Jewish monuments. For those who did not get it
first 108 times, the NYT repeated the story last week. That was just
one too many times for me. This well circulated Jewish American
newspaper always stirs the suspicious side of my brain. I recall their
reports on the impending Jewish pogroms in Moscow in 1990, that
somehow never materialized, but the reports sent one million Russian
Jews to Israel. I remember their reports on the Timishowara 'massacre'
in Romania, that turned out to be a fake. But the report led to the
summary execution of the president Ceausescu and his wife. I remember
how the Times agitated against the noble Cuban military assistance to
Namibia that broke the spine of South African apartheid. Knowing the
Palestinians, I had difficulty believing that those who had worshipped
at the shrine for uncounted generations, would destroy it.
<p>
What I found at the site of Joseph's resting place was like a
replay of the old Jewish joke: "Is it true that Cohen won a
million in the state lottery? Yes, it is true, but it was only
ten dollars, in a poker game, and he actually lost it". Instead
of expected ruins, the tomb shone in its pristine
beauty. No traces of war could be seen. The Nablus municipality
hired the best masons, brought in Italian experts and restored
the tomb to its original state. They removed the barbed wire, the
machinegun positions, the armoured vehicles, the soldiers' scrubby
mess hall, guard slots. An Israeli-built military base vanished to be
replaced by the resurrected holy tomb. It was a joy to revisit Joseph,
as my previous visit, a month before the uprising, was quite
disconcerting.
<p>
Then I visited Nablus in the company of two tourists, a Christian and
a Jew. We visited the Samaritan synagogue, drank water from Jacob's
Well in the church, looked into the Green Mosque and decided to pay
our respects to Joseph the Beautiful. An old Palestinian policeman,
who cut his teeth in the British army, allowed us to approach the tomb
but warned us that we won't be let in. He was right. Young Russian
boys in the Israeli army fatigues, helmets and rifles, popped out and
told us, that in order to enter the tomb one has to go to the army HQ
out of town, submit to security check and interrogation, and come back
by the armoured bus. We moved on to more accessible sites.
<p>
For generations, the Tomb of Joseph was cherished and attended by the
people of Nablus, but it was seized by the Israelis in 1975. The
infamous Oslo accords left it as an armed Israeli enclave in the heart
of the Palestinian city. It became a Yeshiva of a Cabbalist sect led
by Rabbi Isaac Ginzburg. His name should ring a bell. He stated in the
interview with Jewish Week, that a Jew is entitled to cut off the
liver of any Gentile in order to save his own life, as the life of a
Jew is incomparably more precious than the life of a Gentile. He was
asked by the interviewer to soften his message, but he remained
adamant. Many Israeli papers republished this interview, as name of
Ginzburg was well known.
<p>
A year earlier, Ginzburg's disciples made a sortie to a
neighbouring Palestinian village, and a sect member murdered a
13-year old girl. He was arrested and brought to trial. Ginzburg
was called as a witness of defence, and under oath, he proclaimed that
a Jew could not be tried for murdering a Gentile, as the commandment
'Thou shall not murder' refers only to Jews. Killing a Gentile is, at
worst,a misdemeanour, said he, as 'one can not compare the blood of
Jews and the blood of Gentiles'.
<p>
In his Cultural History of the Jews, Zvi Howard Adelman of
Jerusalem (available on the website of The Department for Jewish
Zionist Education), quotes Ginzburg and some of his colleagues.
One of his fellow-Cabbalists, Rabbi Israel Ariel, wrote in 1982
in the time of Sabra and Shatila massacre, that "Beirut is part
of the Land of Israel. . . our leaders should have entered
Lebanon and Beirut without hesitation, and killed every single
one of them. Not a memory should have remained".
<p>
Now, every faith has its fringe extremists and fanatics.
Certainly, the vast majority of Jews, including religious Jews
does not subscribe to, indeed are repulsed by such cannibalistic
sentiments. But such revulsion did not stop
the Israeli army from guarding Ginzburg's Yeshiva. The revulsion
did not stop the Israeli government from subsidizing it, or from
forcing the Palestinians to accept this enclave of hatred in the
heart of Nablus, or
from waging a mini-war to promote Ginzburg's zeal. The revulsion
did not stop the American Jews from their blind support of
Israeli policies. The revulsion did not stop me from paying my
taxes to the government of Israel, knowing full well that part of it
went to support of Ginzburg's sect. The revulsion did not stop the New
York Times and its American media affiliates from propagating the
blood libel of "Arabs despoiling a Jewish holy place". Ginzburg is
entitled to his obnoxious beliefs. We live in an age when our
tolerance extends to all save a Christian prayer in schools. One is
free to join a Satanist or a Cabbalist sect. But should such people be
armed with Apache gunships at the expense of American taxpayers?
Ginzburg and his sect have influence far beyond their tiny numbers.
They are dangerous for all Gentiles, and for the 'rebellious Jews'
like the late Prime Minister Rabin. In what might have been a small
rehearsal for the coming confrontation over Jerusalem's shrines,
twenty young Palestinians were made to pay with their lives to restore
their right to worship at the tomb.
<p>
Now, as before 1975, local folk and tourists, Moslems,
Samaritans, Jews, Christians and freethinkers can visit the place
freely, if they can escape Israeli sharpshooters. They can put a
flower on the gravestone of a favourite hero of the Bible, the Koran
prophet, the lover of Ferdowsi's poem and Saadi verses, the
truth-seeker of the Sufi revelation of Jami. Joseph came back to the
people who always venerated him. You are free to visit him, but please
leave your tanks behind.

<p>Palestinians fought the army base, not the holy place. The holy
places of Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron would be safe in
Palestinian hands, as they have been for uncounted generations.
Without the local veneration, none would have survived. Please
remember it when (very soon) the problem of
Jerusalem will come forth.

<p>This latest saga on the events surrounding the Joseph's tomb is
just one more proof that the American mass media machine is an
unreliable source. The great nation, the formidable superpower
gets its knowledge and navigates its course in the sea of world
politics by using a Mickey Mouse telescope instead of electronic
magnifying glasses. If the Jewish media lords cheat you about
Palestine, why do you think they are honest in any other way?
Perhaps the suffering of the Palestinians should help the
Europeans and
Americans to notice the reefs ahoy their own ship.
