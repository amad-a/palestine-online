<h3>The End Of Oslo</h3>
<p>Professor Edward Said
 <p>Misreported and flawed from the start, the Oslo peace process has 
entered its terminal phase of violent confrontation, disproportionately 
massive Israeli repression, widespread Palestinian rebellion and great loss 
of life, mainly Palestinian. Ariel Sharon's September 28 visit to Haram 
al Sharif 
could not have occurred without Ehud Barak's concurrence; how else 
could Sharon have appeared there with at least a thousand soldiers guarding 
him? Barak's approval rating rose from 20 to 50 percent after the 
visit, and the stage seems set for a national unity government ready to be 
still more 
violent and repressive. 

     
<p>The portents of this disarray, however, were there from the 1993 start, 
as I duly noted in The Nation (September 20, 1993). Labor and Likud 
leaders alike made no secret of the fact that Oslo was designed to 
segregate the Palestinians in noncontiguous, economically unviable enclaves, 
surrounded by 
Israeli-controlled borders, with settlements and settlement roads 
punctuating and essentially violating the territories' integrity. 
Expropriations and house demolitions proceeded inexorably through the Rabin, 
Peres, Netanyahu and Barak administrations, along with the expansion and 
multiplication 
of settlements (200,000 Israeli Jews added to Jerusalem, 200,000 more 
in Gaza and the West Bank), military occupation continuing and every 
tiny step taken toward Palestinian sovereignty--including agreements to 
withdraw in minuscule, agreed-upon phases--stymied, delayed, canceled at 
Israel's 
will. 

<p>This method was politically and strategically absurd. Occupied East 
Jerusalem was placed out of bounds by a bellicose Israeli campaign to 
decree the intractably divided city off-limits to West Bank and Gaza 
Palestinians and to claim it as Israel's "eternal, undivided capital." The 4 
million 
Palestinian refugees--now the largest and longest existing such 
population anywhere--were told that they could forget about return or 
compensation. With his own corrupt and repressive regime supported by both 
Israel's Mossad and the CIA, Yasir Arafat continued to rely on US 
mediation, even though 
the US negotiating team was dominated by former Israeli lobby officials 
and a President whose ideas about the Middle East showed no 
understanding of the Arab-Islamic world. Compliant but isolated and unpopular Arab 
chiefs (especially Egypt's Hosni Mubarak) were humiliatingly compelled 
to toe the 
American line, thereby further diminishing their eroded credibility at 
home. Israel's priorities were always put first. No attempt was made to 
address the injustice done when the Palestinians were dispossessed in 
1948. 

<p>Back of the peace process were two unchanging Israeli/American 
presuppositions, both of them derived from a startling incomprehension of 
reality. The first was that after enough punishment and beating, 
Palestinians would give up, accept the compromises Arafat did in fact accept and 
call the whole 
Palestinian cause off, thereafter excusing Israel for everything it has 
done. Thus, the "peace process" gave no considered attention to immense 
Palestinian losses of land and goods, or to the links between past 
dislocation and present statelessness, while as a nuclear power with a 
formidable 
military, Israel continued to claim the status of victim and demand 
restitution for genocidal anti-Semitism in Europe. There has still been no 
official acknowledgment of Israel's (by now amply documented) 
responsibility for the tragedy of 1948. But one can't force people to forget, 
especially 
when the daily reality is seen by all Arabs as reproducing the original 
injustice. 

<p>Second, after seven years of steadily worsening economic and social 
conditions for Palestinians eve
rywhere, Israeli and US policy-makers persisted in trumpeting their 
successes, excluding the United Nations and other interested parties, 
bending the partisan media to their wills, distorting the actuality into 
ephemeral victories for "peace." With the entire Arab world up in arms 
over Israeli he
licopter gunships and tanks demolishing Palestinian civilian buildings, 
with almost 100 fatalities and almost 2,000 wounded, including many 
children, and with Palestinian Israelis rising up against 
their treatment as third-class citizens, the misaligned and skewed 
status quo is falling apart. Iso
lated in the UN and unloved everywhere in the Arab world as Israel's 
unconditional champion, the Un
ited States and its lame-duck President have little to contribute. 

<p>Neither does the Arab and Israeli leadership, even though they are 
likely to cobble up another inte
rim agreement. Extraordinary has been the virtual silence of the 
Zionist peace camp in the United S
tates, Europe and Israel. The slaughter of Palestinian youths goes on 
while they back Israeli bruta
lity or express disappointment at Palestinian ingratitude. Worst of all 
are the US media, cowed by 
the fearsome Israeli lobby, with commentators and anchors spinning 
distorted reports about "crossfi
re" and "Palestinian violence" that eliminate the fact that Israel is 
in military occupation and th
at Palestinians are fighting it, not "laying siege to Israel," as 
Madeleine Albright put it. While 
the United States celebrates the Serbian people's victory over 
Milosevic, Clinton and his aides ref
use to see the Palestinian insurgency as the same kind of struggle 
against injustice. 

<p>My guess is that some of the new Palestinian intifada is directed at 
Arafat, who has led his people
 astray with phony promises and maintains a battery of corrupt 
officials holding down commercial mo
nopolies even as they negotiate incompetently and weakly on his behalf. 
Sixty percent of the public
 budget is disbursed by Arafat to bureaucracy and security, only 2 
percent to the infrastructure. T
hree years ago his own accountants admitted to an annual $400 million 
in disappeared funds. His int
ernational patrons accept this in the name of the "peace process," 
certainly the most hated phrase 
in the Palestinian lexicon today. 

<p>An alternative peace plan and leadership is slowly emerging among 
leading Israeli, West Bank, Gaza 
and diaspora Palestinians, a thousand of whom have signed a set of 
declarations that have great pop
ular support: no return to the Oslo framework; no compromise on the 
original UN Resolutions (242, 3
38 and 194) on the basis of which the Madrid Conference was convened in 
1991; removal of all settle
ments and military roads; evacuation of all the territories annexed or 
occupied in 1967; boycott of
 Israeli goods and services. A new sense may actually be dawning that 
only a mass movement against 
Israeli apartheid (similar to South Africa's) will work. Certainly it 
is wrong for Barak and Albrig
ht to hold Arafat responsible for what he no longer fully controls. 
Rather than dismiss the new fra
mework being proposed, Israel's supporters would be wise to remember 
that the question of Palestine
 concerns an entire people, not an aging and discredited leader. 
Besides, peace in Palestine/Israel
 can be made only between equals once the military occupation has 
ended. No Palestinian, not even A
rafat, can really accept anything less.
