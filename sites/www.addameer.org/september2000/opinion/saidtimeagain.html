<h3> Trying again and again </h3>
<p>By Edward Said 

  
 

<p>
THE last-ditch American effort to make Yasser 
Arafat terminate his own people's sovereign existence bears the heavy 
imprint not 
only of the US-Israeli lobby but of Bill 
Clinton's political style. To say of Clinton's bridging proposals, as 
they have been 
euphemistically called, that they are a sort 
of fast food peace is to scant and even underestimate their malevolent 
sloppiness. 
<p>
What in their all-purpose catchiness, their 
anti-historical bullying, and the egotistical urgency of their manner 
they most resemble is 
Clinton at his desk, one hand holding the 
telephone to his ear, the other clutching at the pizza slice he 
munches away at, even as his 
various staffers, funders, fixers, cronies and 
golf-playing buddies mill around him giving (and getting) favours, 
loans, grants, deals, 
mortgages, gossip. 
<p>
This is then scarcely a fitting end for a 
struggle that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and untold 
treasure for well over a 
century. Put forward in a language that 
(speaking myself as a teacher of how language is used and abused) 
fairly reeks of a 
dismissive silliness combined with vagueness, 
Clinton proposes what in effect is a warmed-over Israeli intention to 
perpetuate 
control over Palestinian lives and land for 
the foreseeable future. 
<p>
The underlying premise is that Israel needs 
protection from Palestinians, not the other way round. And there's the 
flaw in the whole 
thing: that Israel is not only forgiven its 33 
year old occupation, its 52 year old oppression and dispossession of 
the entire Palestinian 
people, its countless brutalizations and 
dehumanizations of the Palestinians individually and collectively, but 
is rewarded with such 
things as annexation of the best West Bank 
land, a long (and doubtless inexpensive)lease of the Jordan valley, 
and the terminal 
annexation of most of East Jerusalem, plus 
early warning stations on Palestinian territories, plus control of all 
Palestinian borders 
(which are only to be with Israel, not with 
any other state), plus all the roads and water supply, plus the 
cancellation of all refugee 
rights of return and compensation except as 
Israel sees fit. 
<p>
As for the famous land swap by which Israel 
magnanimously gives up a little bit of the Negev desert for the 
choicest bits of the West 
Bank, Clinton overlooks the fact that that 
particular Negev area earmarked by Israel just happens also to have 
been used by it as a 
toxic waste dump! Besides, given the peculiar 
divisions cutting up East Jerusalem - all of which is illegally 
annexed land anyway - 
and the three (instead of four) cantons into 
which the West Bank territory ceded conditionally by Israel will be 
divided, all of what 
has been described as an American 
breakthrough proposal pretty much dissolves. What the Palestinians are 
left with are material 
sacrifices which make Israeli "concessions" 
look like child's play. 
<p>
The sacrifices demanded by Clinton are, of 
course, a cancellation of the Palestinian right of return for 
refugees, and just as great, a 
Palestinian declaration of the end of the 
conflict with Israel. First of all, the right of return for refugees 
(the right to a secure life in a 
place of one's choice) is a right guaranteed 
not just by UN resolutions but by the Charter of the UN and the 
Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. 
<p>
Clinton's formula for getting round this 
little problem reveals the man's approach to the world: " I believe we 
need to adopt a 
formulation on the right of return that will 
make clear that there is no specific right of return to Israel itself 
but does not negate the 
aspiration of the Palestinian people to 
return to the area." To which area? Iraq, Jordan, and Syria, for 
example, can easily be 
described as belonging to "the area." Who does 
Clinton think he is fooling? So then, why purposely and transparently 
try to confuse 
Palestinians with the phrase "the area" if 
what is actually meant is not allowing them a right to return to the 
country from which they 
were in fact driven? 
<p>
As Clinton well knows (he is a lawyer by 
training) there can be no negotiation at all when it comes to human 
rights; according to the 
very laws which the US pretends to uphold when 
it bombs some defenceless country like Sudan or post-Gulf War Iraq, no 
one can 
therefore either modify or negate any of the 
major human rights. Moreover it is impossible, for example, to uphold 
rights against 
discrimination or against the right to work, 
in some cases and not in others. Basic human rights are not elements 
of a menu, to be 
chosen or rejected at will: they are meant to 
have the stability of universal acceptance, especially by charter 
members of the UN. 
Granted that the implementation of rights is 
always a major problem, but that has nothing to do with the fact that 
as rights they exist 
whether or not they are implemented, and 
therefore cannot be abrogated, modified or, as Clinton seems to think, 
re-formulated. 
<p>
Similarly, the right to choose one's place of 
residence as a refugee: that too is unalienable and un-negotiable. 
Neither Arafat, nor 
Clinton, nor certainly Barak has any right at 
all to tamper with the right, nor to attempt by crude bamboozling to 
"reformulate" it in a 
way that suits Israel or renounces it in any 
way. Why must Israel always be an exception and why must Palestinians 
always be 
required to accept things that no people have 
ever been asked to accept before them? It seems to me indecent for 
Clinton to have 
gone to war, dragging all of NATO with him and 
destroying Serbia in the process on behalf of the Kosovo Albanians' 
right of 
return, and then ask Palestinians to renounce 
theirs. 
<p>
A second point here is to recall that Israel, 
which continues with unremitting obduracy to deny any responsibility 
for Palestinian 
dispossession, maintains an unchallenged Law 
of Return for any Jew anywhere. How it can continue to do so and with 
a kind of 
ruffianly churlishness refuse even to discuss 
a similar Palestinian right defies logic, to say nothing of elementary 
fairness. There is also 
the matter of compensation, not only for the 
enormous losses of 1948, but for the thirty three years of spoliation 
and exploitation 
that have come with the ever-present military 
occupation. 
<p>
Bill Clinton wants all that dropped, as if by 
not mentioning a word about reparations the whole subject would 
disappear. It seems 
condescending to tell Palestinians that 
Israel will mutter a few words about understanding or even recognizing 
their suffering and get 
off without a single mention of 
responsibility. Who is that typically l950s style propaganda formula 
supposed to placate? Israel, or 
the Jewish Agency? 
<p>
But Arafat did indeed come to Washington in 
response to Clinton's summoning, and because he is who he is, Arafat 
will probably 
not refuse or accept outright. He will 
waffle, and manoeuvre, and come and go, will conditionally accept, as 
more Palestinians will 
have sacrificed their lives and, almost as 
important, their livelihoods for nought. 
<p>
Over the past weeks I have tried in every way 
available to me to get Arafat for once in his long domination of 
Palestinian affairs to 
address his people honestly, directly, in a 
straightforward way. But he persists in silence. And his advisers and 
associates also flutter 
around, powerless to influence him or to come 
up with anything by way of alternatives. Yet again I want to say, we 
need a new kind 
of leadership, one that can mobilize and 
inspire the whole Palestinian nation; we have had enough of flying 
visits in and out of Cairo, 
Rabat and Washington, enough of lies and 
misleading rhetoric, enough of corruption and rank incompetence, 
enough of carrying on 
at the people's expense, enough of servility 
before the Americans, enough of stupid decisions, enough of criminal 
incompetence and 
uncertainty. 
<p>
It is clear that no matter what happens now, 
the Palestinians will be blamed: unabashed Zionist prophets like 
Thomas Friedman of 
the New York Times, who has not one word of 
criticism for Israeli brutality and keeps demanding that Arabs must 
recognize his 
"organic" connection as a Jew to Palestine 
without ever acknowledging that that right was implemented in conquest 
and wholesale 
Palestinian dispossession, will upbraid 
Palestinians for wrecking the peace, and continue broadcasting his 
half-truths in the American 
media, but all to no avail. Whether he and his 
associates like it or not, Israel can only have peace when the 
Palestinian right is first 
acknowledged to have been violated, and when 
there is apology and remorse where there is now arrogance and 
rhetorical bluster. 
<p>
Our first duty as Palestinians is to close 
this Oslo chapter as expeditiously as possible and return to our main 
task, which is to 
provide ourselves with a strategy of 
liberation that is clear in its goals and well defined in practice. 
For this we must at some point 
have the partnership of likeminded Israelis 
and diaspora Jews who understand that you cannot have occupation and 
dispossession 
as well as peace with the Palestinian people. 
South African apartheid was defeated only because blacks as well as 
whites fought it. 
<p>
That the PLO has long thought that it could 
make peace with Israel and somehow tolerate occupation is only one of 
its numerous 
strategic as well as tactical mistakes. A new 
generation is arising now that no longer respects the old taboos and 
will not tolerate the 
lamentable "flexibility" that has given 
Palestinian liberation the status of a question mark rather than that 
of a beacon of hope. 
<p>
There are two contradictory realities on the 
ground on which Clinton's Washington talks will founder. One is that 
the energies 
released by the intifada are not easily 
containable in any available form for the foreseeable future: 
Palestinian protest at what Oslo 
has wrought is a protest against all aspects 
of the status quo. The second reality is that whether we like it or 
not historical Palestine is 
now a bi-national reality suffering the 
devastation of apartheid. That must end and an era of freedom for 
Arabs and Jews must soon 
begin. It falls to us to try now to provide 
the signposts for a new era. Otherwise it is easy to foresee years 
more of fruitless and 
costly struggle.- Copyright Edward W. Said,
