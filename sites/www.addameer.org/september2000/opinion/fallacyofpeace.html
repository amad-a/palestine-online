<h3>The fallacy of peace in the Middle East</h3>


<p> 

 By Osama Shabaneh<br> Special to The Seattle Times

 <p>During a recent trip to the West Bank, I happened to share a taxi 
ride
from
 Bethlehem to my hometown of Hebron with a few Palestinian laborers.
 Throughout the hour-long trip, the laborers discussed their day at 
work
and
 their plans for the next day. As I understood from the discussion, 
these
men
 were construction workers who had just finished their day shift in 
the
 Israeli settlement of Har Homa, or Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.

 <p>When the Israeli government in 1997 approved building in this 
settlement,
 there was not only a Palestinian but also an international outcry 
since
the
 settlement was construed as changing the status quo of the boundaries 
of
 Jerusalem. Three years later, the Palestinians themselves are helping
build
 the settlement.

 <p>Can these men be branded as traitors for helping Israel expand by 
usurping
 more Palestinian land? Or are they more victims of the 
Israeli-Palestinian
 peace process that appears to be on the edge of collapse?

 <p>The 1987-93 Palestinian uprising against the Israeli military 
occupation
of
 Palestine ended with the signing of the Oslo peace accord between the 
two
 sides. I was very much in support of the peace moves that halted, for 
a
 while, the bloodshed that characterized the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict
for
 so many years. As a Palestinian, I had experienced the Israeli 
occupation
 firsthand, and I hoped that the peace accord was the beginning of 
giving
the
 Palestinians their rights and freedom they had sought for a long 
time. I
wanted my family, still back in the town of Hebron, to feel safe in 
their
 home, to have hope of a better future, and to live in peace with no
Israeli
 soldiers around.

 <p>I grew up in Hebron accustomed to the sight of those soldiers, in 
their
 military jeeps or on foot, patrolling the streets of the West Bank,
 sometimes enforcing curfews on Palestinian residents and occasionally
 stopping and slapping or arresting Palestinians who had forgotten 
their
 identity cards, which were issued by the Israeli military 
authorities.
Every
 Palestinian over 16 years of age had to obtain these orange-colored
identity
 cards, and had to have it on them at all times.

 <p>I remember having to skip school the day I turned 16 in order to go 
to the
Israeli military headquarters in Hebron to obtain my card. It was 
1971,
and
 it was the first time I had to undergo questioning by the Israelis 
about
my
 political beliefs. I was too young to have any of those beliefs. I 
always
took the Israeli presence for granted, and I had never imagined what
freedom
 felt like. For many years following my 16th birthday and, in fact, 
until
 now, I have a recurring dream of me leaving my house in Hebron 
without my
 orange identity card, and being stopped by the Israeli soldiers. No 
peace
 can wipe out the scars of occupation.

<p> Since 1993, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has had its ups and
downs.
 My family and friends in the region were euphoric when the prospects 
of
 peace were first offered to them. But as the years passed, they 
became
more
 gloomy and dejected, and I could see why during my visits. As a
consequence
 of the peace process, the Israeli army redeployed its forces away 
from
 heavily Palestinian-populated areas, but its presence was felt as 
strongly
 as ever.

 <p>The Palestinians came to the realization that the peace process was 
just a
 ploy by the Israelis to convince the world that Israel was granting 
the
 Palestinians self-determination, while at the same time maintaining 
their
 presence in and around every village, every town, every city, and 
every
 refugee camp in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel, during the so-called 
peace
 process years, continued killing more Palestinian civilians, 
confiscating
 more Palestinian land, arresting more people for their political 
beliefs,
 controlling every thoroughfare in Palestine, and overseeing every 
aspect
of
 Palestinian life, except the mundane.

 <p>The Palestinian passport that Israel allowed the Palestinian 
Authority to
 issue to Palestinians includes, on the first page, the same ID number 
that
 is found on the Israeli-issued orange identity card. Now occupation 
had a
 new face and a new color, green instead of orange. Yet, freedom for 
the
 Palestinians remained a dream.

 <p>Take the inflammatory issue of Jerusalem. Israel has been claiming 
that it
grants freedom of worship to all Palestinians. For 13 years now,
Jerusalem,
which includes one of the holiest places for Muslims, has been sealed 
off
to
most Palestinians. Israeli checkpoints at every junction around 
Jerusalem
 prevent Muslims and Christians from entering the city to worship 
without a
special permit. The Israelis do a detailed security check on every
 applicant, and usually reject, without justification, issuing any 
permits.

 <p>I called my family in Hebron a few days after the outbreak of 
violence in
 the West Bank. With the echo of bullets in the background, my mother 
told
me
to worry about myself and not to worry about them. She said that only 
God
could help them in their current situation. I could not agree more.
Watching
TV that night, and every night, I flip through the news channels of 
the
 American media, and all I see are reports, analyses, politicians and
experts
 - all but very few blaming the Palestinians for driving the region to 
the
brink of war, and portraying Israel as the peace-seeker.
<p>The utter denial of the Palestinians' humanity has characterized the 
media
for a long time, and now it is no different. It took a peace process
littered with suffering and death for the Palestinians to realize 
that the
world just doesn't care about their struggle for freedom and
self-determination.
The Palestinian laborers wanted to feed their children, and building 
a
settlement for Israelis was the only way they found before them. This 
is a
tragic consequence of an unjust peace. As long as Israel insists on
controlling the will of another nation, as long as it keeps looking 
down
at
Palestinians as unequal peace partners, as long as it keeps 
confiscating
Palestinian land and holding political prisoners, peace will remain a
fallacy. There is only one way out, and that is not by more summits 
and
 meaningless discussions. The only way out is for Israel to set the
 Palestinians free, and let them be.
