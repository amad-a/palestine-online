<h3>Rape of Dulcinea</h3>
<p>  By Israel Shamir
<p>11 February 2001


<p>
      The touching words of Elie Wiesel (Jerusalem in My Heart, NYT
      1/25/2001) painted a beautiful portrait of the Jewish people,
      yearning for Jerusalem, loving and praying for it over the
      centuries and cherishing its name from generation to 
generation.
      <p>

      This potent image reminded me, an Israeli writer from Jaffa, of
      something familiar yet elusive. I finally made the connection by
      revisiting my well-thumbed volume of Don Quixote. Wiesel's
      evocative article is so wonderfully reminiscent of the immortal
      love of the Knight of Sad Visage to his belle Dulcinea de
      Toboso. Don Quixote traveled all over Spain proclaiming her
      name. He performed formidable feats, defeated giants, who turned
      out to be windmills, brought justice to the oppressed, and so
      much more for the sake of his beloved. When he decided that his
      achievements made him worthy, he sent his arms bearer, Sancho
      Pansa, to his Dame with a message of adoration. 
<p>
      Now I find myself in the somewhat embarrassing position of
      Sancho Pansa. 
<p>
      I have to inform my master, Don Wiesel Quixote, that his
      Dulcinea is well. She is happily married, has a bunch of kids,
      and she is quite busy with laundry and other domestic chores.
      While he fought brigands and restored governors, somebody else
      took care of his beloved, fed her, provided her with food, made
      love to her, made her a mother and grandmother. Do not rush,
      dear knight, to Toboso, or it would break your heart. 
<p>
      Elie, the Jerusalem that you write of so movingly is not now and
      never has been desolate. She has lived happily across the
      centuries in the embrace of another people, the Palestinians of
      Jerusalem, who have taken good care of her. They made her the
      beautiful city she is, adorned her with a magnificent piece of
      jewelry, the Golden Dome of Haram al Sharif, built their houses
      with pointed arches and wide porches and planted cypresses and
      palm trees. 
<p>
      They do not mind if the knight-errant visits their beloved city
      on his way from New York to Saragosa. But be reasonable, old
      man. Stay within the frame of the story and within the bounds of
      common decency. Don Quixote did not drive on his jeep into
      Toboso to rape his old flame. OK, you loved her, and thought
      about her, but it does not give you the right to kill her
      children, bulldoze her rose garden and put your boots on her
      dining room table. All your words just prove that you confuse
      your desires with reality. If you must continue to ask why the
      Palestinians want Jerusalem? Because she belongs to them,
      because they live there and it is their hometown. Granted, you
      dreamed about her in your remote Polish hamlet. So did many
      people around the world. She is so wonderful and certainly worth
      dreaming about. 
<p>
      Elie, many people have adored this city across the ages. Swedish
      craftsmen left their villages and moved there to build the
      lovely American Colony together with the Vesters, a devout
      Christian family from Chicago. You can read about it in the
      works of Selma Lagerlof, another Nobel Prize winner. On the
      slopes of the Mount of Olives, the Russians built the dainty
      church of Mary Magdalene. Ethiopians erected their Resurrection
      monastery amid the ruins left by the Crusaders. 
<p>
      The British died for her and left as their architectural legacy
      the St George Cathedral and St Andrew's. The Germans built the
      lovely German Colony and nursed the city's sick in the Schneller
      Hospital. My devout great-grandfather moved into the protection
      of her thick walls in 1870-s from a Lithuanian Jewish village
      and threw his lot with the hospitable Jerusalemites. He found
      his eternal rest until the day of Resurrection on the slopes of
      Mount of Olives. None of them thought to rape their Dulcinea.
      They just left bouquets of architectural flowers as testament of
      their adoration. 
<p>
      Those who love Jerusalem are legion. It is disingenuous of Elie
      Wiesel to reduce the struggle for this city as a tug of war
      between Muslims and Jews. It is a question of coveting property
      versus having the deed of ownership. The resolution of this case
      should be based on the 10th commandment, observed by our
      fathers. They knew that veneration does not amount to the right
      of ownership. Millions of Protestants venerate the
      Catholic-owned Gethsemane Garden, but it does not transfer the
      garden into their hands. Millions of Catholics visit the Tomb of
      Mary, but it still belongs to the Eastern Church. For
      generations, the Moslems have come to kneel at the birthplace of
      Jesus in Bethlehem, but the church remains Christian forever. 
<p>
      What water did to Gremlins in Spielberg's movies, Zionism has
      inflicted on the jolly Jewish folk of Eastern Europe. It caused
      them to carry out the ethnic clearing of Gentiles in West
      Jerusalem, to convert Schneller hospital and church into a
      military base and to build a Holiday Inn on top of the venerated
      shrine of Sheik Bader. The Israeli State forbids the Christians
      of Bethlehem to pray in the Holy Sepulcher and bans Moslems
      below the age of 40 from attending Friday prayers at al Aqsa
      mosque. These changes of the city by the Israeli government
      amount to her rape. 
<p>
      In order to justify this rape, you invoke the names of King
      Solomon and Jeremiah, quote the Koran and the Bible. Let me tell
      you a Jewish Hassidic tale, one you might have heard in your
      Polish schtetl. A Jewish midrash, a legend, mentions that
      Abraham had a daughter. A simple-minded Hassid asked his Rabbi,
      why Abraham did not wed his daughter and his son Isaac. The
      Rabbi responded that Abraham did not want to marry a real son to
      a legendary daughter. 
<p>
      The legends are the stuff the dreams are made of. Some are
      charming, some are horrible, and none is valid as a deed to the
      land or as a political platform. Elie, you certainly would not
      like to lose your private home in New York because of a few
      verses written in the Book of Mormon. This game of spreading the
      Zionist gospel is becoming irrelevant, but I will play one more
      round with you for the entertainment of the crowd. As every
      archaeologist will tell you, King Solomon and his temple belong
      to the fantasy realm of Abraham's daughter. Moreover, and not
      that it matters, but the name of Jerusalem is not mentioned even
      once in the Jewish Holy Book, the Torah. 
<p>
      Elie, you want to play some more games? I'll tell you more. The
      Jews are not even mentioned in the Jewish Bible. Get that thick
      book off of your shelf and check it. None of the great and
      legendary men you named, from King David to the prophets, were
      called 'the Jews'. This ethnonym appears the first and only time
      in the Bible in the Persian story of the very late Book of
      Esther. The self-identification of the Jews with the tribes of
      Israel and with the heroes of the Bible is as valid as the story
      of Rome being founded by the Trojan prince Aeneus. If the modern
      Turks, who call themselves 'the descendants of Troy' would
      conquer Rome, dynamite Borromini's baroque masterpieces and
      expel her inhabitants in order to re-establish the legacy of
      Aeneus, they would just be repeating the folly of the Zionists.
      Our ancestors, the humble East European folk of Yids, whose
      language was Yiddish, had a tradition of adorning themselves
      with the impressive heraldic lions of Biblical heroes. Their
      claim of descent from these legends was as valid as the claims
      of Thomas Hardy's ambitious farmer girl Tess. But event the
      fictional Tess did not conspire to evict the lords from their
      castle and claim the manor for herself.
<p>
      Once, walking with the Christian pilgrims to the great Church of
      the Holy Sepulcher, I was stopped by a Hassidic Jew. He inquired
      whether my companions were Jews, and, receiving a negative
      reply, exclaimed in amazement: "What are these Goyyim Gentiles
      looking for in the holy city?" He had never heard of the Passion
      of Jesus Christ, whose name he used as a swear word. I am
      equally amazed that a Jewish professor from Boston University is
      as ignorant as the simple-minded Hassidic Jew. Jerusalem is holy
      to billions of believers: Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern
      Christians, Sunni and Shia Moslems, to thousands of Hassidic and
      Sephardic Jews. Still, as a city, Jerusalem is not different
      from any place in the world; she belongs to her citizens. 

      <p>Twenty more years of Zionist control of this ancient city would
      turn her into just another Milwaukee and forever ruins her
      charm. Jerusalem needs to be restored to its inhabitants. The
      seized properties in Talbieh and Lifta, Katamon and Malcha
      should be returned to their owners. Professor Wiesel, respect
      the Gentile property rights as you would like Gentiles to
      respect your right to your lovely house. The holy sites of
      Jerusalem are regulated by the 150 years old international
      statute (Status Quo) that should not be tampered with. Last
      attempt to touch it caused the siege of Sevastopol and the
      charge of the light brigade at Balaclava. Next attempt could
      cause the nuclear war.
