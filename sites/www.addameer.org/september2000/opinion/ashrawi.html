Anatomy of Racism, by Dr. Hanan Ashrawi<BR>
 
Jerusalem, October 18, 2000</H3>



<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3>"Blaming 
the victim" has been the common resort of the guilty in rationalizing and 
distorting the horror of the crime 
itself.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
From Miftah, <A 
HREF="mailto:info@miftah.org">info@miftah.org</A></P><BR>


<P>
Whether battered wives, abused children, or Palestinians long 
subjected to the brutality of the horrendous Israeli military 
occupation, the first (and last) resort of the cowardly is in maligning the 
victim, in accusing him/her/them of having brought about the deserved 
cruelty of the crime.</P>


<P>
The essential prerequisite, of course, is 
the total dehumanization of the victims and the elimination of their most 
basic rights and attributes as well as claims to 
protection.</P>


<P>
Inevitably, the resultant compound victimization is further enhanced by 
increased vulnerability, distortion, and exclusion from the protection 
of human consideration and moral imperatives.</P>


<P>
Hence, the 
latest eruption of confrontations between the Israeli occupation army and 
civilian Palestinian protestors became the playing field for the full 
force of the Israeli "spin machine" in a most deliberate, concentrated, 
and racist exercise of deception and dehumanization directed against a 
whole people.</P>


<P>
The most basic form of deception is in 
fabricating a false symmetry between occupier and occupied, between oppressor 
and victim. The "violence" of the powerful Israeli occupation army using 
live ammunition, tanks and helicopter gun ships is (at best) equated 
with the "violence" of Palestinian civilians protesting their 
victimization and continued loss of rights, lands, and lives.</P>


<P>
In 
addition, the Palestinians are called upon to be docile, to stop the 
"violence," to end the "siege" of Israel-as though the strongest army in the 
region is being "threatened" by the unarmed people's rejection of its 
occupation and brutality. The obvious and simple solution, of course, is to 
withdraw the army and end the occupation.</P>


<P>
This, ironically, 
is accompanied by a devaluation of Palestinian rights and lives by 
translating our objective weakness into a diminution of rights whereby the 
powerful determines the parameters of "justice" for the 
weak.</P>


<P>
The whole presentation constantly exhibits the "white man's burden" 
syndrome. Palestinians should be "grateful" for whatever "generous offer" 
Israel chooses to "grant" them, regardless of the glaring injustice and 
illegality of the Israeli negotiating stance.</P>


<P>
Both the 
extreme right and extreme left in Israel (as well as the US) have adopted 
this condescending, patronizing approach to peace-Barak has gone the 
"farthest" in "offering" the Palestinians almost 90% of their lands with 
some "responsibilities" in Jerusalem, and those "ungrateful" Palestinians 
are being "intransigent" and hard line.</P>


<P>
Having compromised 
ourselves down to 22% of historical Palestine, we are now being asked to 
be party to Israel's illegal annexation of Jerusalem and its settlement 
policies-i.e. an unholy partnership for the violation of international 
law and the relevant UN resolutions.</P>


<P>
Should we be unwilling 
to self-negate, to refuse the role of good little natives, and to 
continue rejecting the Israeli unilateral version of "peace" that "offers" us 
a subservient statelet of isolated Bantustans under Israel's apartheid 
system, then we will be pounded into submission.</P>


<P>
After all, 
if pressure and threat and political arm-twisting do not work, sheer 
naked military aggression can produce the desired results-since "Arabs 
understand only the language of violence."</P>


<P>
Instant scare tactics 
or panic politics come into play with such labels as the "terrorist" or 
"dictatorial" or "violent" Palestinians, while depicting the reality of 
the Palestinian human will to resist subjugation and oppression as 
proof of such misrepresentations.</P>


<P>
A catch-22 situation is clearly 
visible: Arafat must "control" his people (nation of sheep?) and 
"order" them to calm down and accept their enslavement and repression by the 
Israelis, otherwise he is no longer a "peace partner" and cannot be 
considered a "leader."</P>


<P>
At the same time, Israel cannot deal with 
Arafat or the Palestinians because they are inherently "undemocratic" 
and therefore have nothing in common with such "civilized" democracies 
as Israel and the US.</P>


<P>
In parallel, other ready-made labels and 
stereotypical epithets are easily pulled out as a convenient branding 
exercise to reduce the humanity of the Palestinians.</P>


<P>
The 
historical and familiar slurs used by Israeli officials and public figures 
(including cockroaches, two-legged vermin, dogs) have been expanded to 
include "snakes" and "crocodiles."</P>


<P>
The reduction of our 
humanity to a series of abstractions is nowhere as sinister as in the 
numerical game. Palestinian victims of Israeli live fire are daily given as 
"x" numbers killed and "y" numbers wounded. Their names, identities, 
dashed hopes, and shattered dreams are nowhere mentioned. Absent too are 
the grief and anguish of their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and 
other loved ones who will have to live with that tragic 
loss.</P>


<P>
The visual documentation of the cold-blooded murder of the child 
Muhammad al-Durra shattered the complacency of those who had been comfortable 
with the anonymity of the Palestinians and the invisibility of their 
suffering. Even then, the Israeli propaganda machine tried to distort the 
truth even in the face of irrefutable evidence.</P>


<P>
First, it was 
said that he was killed by Palestinian "gun men." Then, he was "caught 
in the crossfire." The worst version was in the cynical depiction of 
the child Muhammad as a "trouble-maker" or a "mischievous" child who 
brought it upon himself-as though the proper response to a child living his 
childhood is deliberate death. The last accusation involved a question: 
"What was he doing there?" The real question should have been "what was 
the Israeli army doing there" in the heart of Palestinian Gaza shooting 
at civilians including a child and his father who had been caught 
red-handed attempting to indulge in the "provocative" act of shopping 
together. </P>


<P>
Note the difference, however, when two Israeli under 
cover agents, belonging to the notorious Israeli death squads were killed 
by Palestinian protestors.</P>


<P>
No Palestinian attempted to 
justify the act. Rather orders were issued to investigate and arrest those 
responsible. After all, there should be such a thing as the rule of law 
and due process.</P>


<P>
Instead, Israel moved its tanks and armies 
even closer to tighten the siege and strangulation of Palestinian towns, 
villages and refugee camps. Then it brought in its Apache helicopter 
gun ships and shelled Palestinian cities and towns in a most senseless 
and cruel form of collective punishment.</P>


<P>
Its version of events 
presented the Israeli agents as reservists who had mistakenly "strayed" 
into Ramallah and then were "lynched" by the mob. References to 
"slaughter" and "blood thirst" and "savagery" became the prevalent verbal 
currency.
</P>

<P>
While no one would condone the killing of the soldiers, 
it is important however, to deal with the real facts and the 
context:</P>


<P>
Ramallah, as a city under total Israeli military siege, was 
closed off to all movement in or out of the city. Only one entrance was 
open, entirely under the control of multiple Israeli military 
checkpoints. Thus to "stray" into Ramallah would require deliberate and repeated 
attempts requiring tenacity, persistence, and even guile.</P>


<P>
The 
two Israeli agents were clearly infiltrated and planted into the midst 
of a protest march in the heart of the city. The occasion was the 
funeral of a Palestinian man, Issam Joudeh Hamad, from the village of Umm 
Safa, who had been abducted by Israeli settlers and tortured to death in 
a most grisly manner.</P>


<P>
Gruesome footage and photographs of the 
body, plus the testimony of the doctors who had examined it, were not 
repeatedly displayed before the eyes of the world for the sake of 
scoring points or dehumanizing the Israelis. Some Arab stations informed me 
that the images were so horrific that they refrained from using 
them.</P>


<P>
Most of the people participating in the march (in the besieged 
Palestinian city of Ramallah) knew the victim, and some had seen the 
body. The two undercover Israeli agents that had infiltrated the march 
were recognized by the Palestinians as members of the "Death Squads" that 
had been responsible for assassinations and 
provocations.</P>


<P>
Despite the fact that the Palestinian police tried to protect them, the 
two were killed before the cameras.</P>


<P>
This immediately became an 
instant justification for branding all Palestinians as murderers, and 
for the most systematic, venomous, hate campaign in recent history. It 
was also used as a justification for the Israeli aerial attacks on 
Ramallah and other Palestinian cities.</P>


<P>
In his moving appeal to his 
compatriots (Oct. 13, 2000) not to exploit this incident to justify 
existing racism and hatred, Israeli poet Yitzhak Laor documents several 
lynchings of Palestinians by Israeli army and security forces. In all 
cases the perpetrators were never punished, and no moral outrage was 
expressed by the Israeli public, let alone a shelling of Israeli 
cities!</P>


<P>
The same applies to the Israeli settler reign of terror that 
targets Palestinians in their own homes and towns, with full Israeli 
military protection and collusion.</P>


<P>
Presented as helpless "Israeli 
civilians" surrounded by "hostile" Palestinians, the sinister and 
lethal nature of settler violence, as armed extremists on the rampage, is 
often ignored. The illegality of Israeli settlements, the fundamentalist 
extremist character of the armed settlers, and the horrific acts of 
abduction, torture, killing and just random violence that are committed 
with impunity-rarely get a mention.</P>


<P>
Throughout all this, the 
Palestinians continue to be blamed. </P>


<P>
The most blatantly racist 
slur is the Israeli theft of our humanity as parents. In an attempt to 
rob us of our most basic feelings for our children, we are accused of 
"sending [our] children out to die" for the sake of "scoring media 
points."</P>


<P>
The horror is further compounded by the total and 
unquestioning equanimity with which such a grand national slur is repeated by 
Israelis of all parties, with no critical distance or even awareness of 
the enormity of such a racist charge.
</P>

<P>
When Palestinian 
children became targets for Israeli snipers and other army violence, the 
ministry of education had no option but to close down the schools 
temporarily in order to minimize the students' exposure on the way to and from 
school.</P>


<P>
That was immediately latched on by the Israeli spin 
machine as proof that we closed down the schools in order to "release" 
our children to go out and "riot" thereby obstructing the free path of 
Israeli bullets.</P>


<P>
The safety of home and parents' attempts at 
protecting their children are not even considered.
</P>

<P>
Actually, 
the 18-month-old baby girl, Sara Abdel-Athim Hassan, was shot in the back 
seat of her father's car, while other child victims were killed in or 
around their own homes. Mu'ayyad al-Jawarish, 12 years old, was shot in 
the garden of his own home.</P>


<P>
Most children were shot in the 
head or upper part of the body, mainly with high velocity bullets. The 
most common targets of rubber-coated steel bullets were the eyes of 
children.</P>


<P>
A shoot-to-kill (or permanently impair) policy has been 
in force by the Israeli army-claiming the lives of more than 105 
Palestinians and wounding more than 3000 (many of whom with permanent 
injuries).
</P>

<P>
Israeli officials claim that they had exercised 
"restraint."</P>


<P>
Of course they can do worse-they can commit genocide or 
complete the ethnic cleansing begun in 1948.</P>


<P>
Still, it is 
Israeli "security" that is at stake.
</P>

<P>
Israel's powerful army of 
occupation cowers in fear at the Palestinian people's cry for justice and 
freedom.</P>


<P>
The Palestinian people have no need for security on 
their own land or in their own homes since they have been thoroughly 
dehumanized by their oppressor as to deserve whatever happens to 
them.</P>


<P>
Worse than being "non-existent" (as in the myth of the "land 
without a people for a people without a land"-which even Shimon Peres now 
seems to espouse), in the minds of the official Israeli narrative, we 
now seem to be existent on a lower plain as sub-human species, bereft of 
the most elemental qualities and rights that guide the conscience and 
moral values of humanity as a whole.</P>


<P>
All this is for the sake 
of alleviating the guilt and responsibility of the real 
culprit.</P>


<P>
Apologists for the Israeli occupation must find an alternative 
address to be blamed for the horror inflicted on the Palestinians-so who 
better than the victims themselves?</P>
