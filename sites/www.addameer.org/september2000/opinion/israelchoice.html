<h3>ISRAEL: Your Only Choice</h3>
<p> By Sam Bahour
<p> Al-Bireh, Palestine October 11,2000 
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Blood is being spilled.  The 
Arab World masses and governments are engaged.  The world community 
is fed up with yet another threat of war in the Middle East due to the 
recurrent core issue of the Palestinians.  Actions on the ground portray 
the ugliness of our potential future. Tensions are threatening a rapidly 
dwindling spiral of all-out-war which, if reached, will commission an 
entirely new generation to being an Occupier and another being brought 
up in a culture of Resistance.  Israel, Mr. Barak, Mr. Clinton – are 
you ready live with this reality for the rest of your lives.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Israel, you have one, and only 
one choice – end your 33 year military and economic occupation of the 
West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem as stipulated by numerous United 
Nation resolutions and the collective will of the entire world.  This 
reality is better acknowledged by you, rather than be continually hung 
on the world’s clothesline of injustice.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Israel, you are beyond saving 
face for your actions during the last century.  A moderate Palestinian 
leadership tried its utmost, through the Oslo Peace Accords, to give 
you an opportunity to exit the historic wrongdoing you have committed 
upon the indigenous people of Palestine.  You refused to implement Oslo. 
During the peace talks you increased the illegal Israeli settlements 
in the West Bank and Gaza at a mind-boggling rate, you kept an iron 
fist policy on the Palestinian economy, you demolished Palestinian homes, 
you confiscated even more Palestinian lands under the premise of creating 
a settler road network, and you used, and are still using Palestinian 
political prisoners as bargaining chips.  In short, you humiliated an 
entire people then you failed to seize the opportunity by them to forgive 
and forget.  Now you, and no one but you will have to face the raw facts 
and deal with the consequences of your actions.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Israel, the 33-year refusal 
to excersize your only choice has now potentially put your country and 
your allies at a tremendous risk for years to come with your children 
at the front lines.  This is ironic given your historic preoccupation 
with your need for security.  Nevertheless, you and only you are responsible 
for your actions.  Now, you and your international ally, the United 
States, must now live with this new reality because it is one of your 
own making.  We can only hope that your military-style pride will not 
blind your common sense and that you have now learned, as expensive 
as that lesson has now become, that your only choice must be rendered 
without any further delay.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Israel, the cards are squarely 
on your table.  Your military machine can open multiple military fronts 
and hope - - a defect hope in my opinion - - that the world remains 
paralyzed to respond.  Your prize here would be your ability to continue 
an internationally exposed and denounced military and economic occupation 
of the Palestinians, maybe for another half-century if you are really 
successful.  Israel, this is not an option but rather a death sentence 
to the conscious of every Jew worldwide.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR></BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">We either plan to literally 
wipe each other off the map or minimize the outrageous damage that has 
been perpetrated and come to our political senses. The decision is totally 
yours.  The upcoming Arab League Summit may be the last stop on this 
treacherous road to war.  Is the State of Israel finally ready to join 
the Middle East?  We will not enter the new millennium under Israel 
occupation, thus, your time is limited and your choice is a single one.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Mr. Barak, your political career 
is not a subject of history.  Your military genius cannot override a 
historic right of an indigenous people.  Take your only choice and start 
the difficult task of mending the wounds – the wounds of Israel’s own 
soul.</FONT>&nbsp;<BR>
