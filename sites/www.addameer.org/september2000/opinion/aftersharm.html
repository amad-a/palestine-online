<h3>After the Sharm al-Shaykh Summit: An Armed and Temporary Truce</h3>
<p> Mouin Rabbani
 <p>(When quoting from this PIN, please cite MERIP Press Information Note 34, "After 
  the Sharm al-Shaykh Summit: An Armed and Temporary Truce," by Mouin Rabbani, 
  October 17, 2000.)
  October 17, 2000 
<p>Details of the understandings reached between Israeli Prime Minister 
  Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat are trickling 
  slowly out of Sharm al-Shaykh, the Egyptian resort where President Bill Clinton 
  convened an emergency international summit October 16. The Israelis and the 
  PA say they will both take "concrete measures" to contain 20 days of violence 
  that has claimed 105 lives, 98 of them Palestinian, in the Occupied Territories 
  and Israel. Israel is said to have agreed to end its siege of Palestinian population 
  centers, pulling back its forces to the positions they occupied September 27. 
  But the popular uprising in the streets of the West Bank and Gaza shows no signs 
  of abating. Meanwhile, Barak's spin doctors put the onus squarely on Arafat, 
  stating that if he fails to quell an uprising he does not control within 48 
  hours, Likud leader Ariel Sharon will be a cabinet minister by next week. <p>Through 
  direct action and with growing Arab and international support, the Palestinian 
  people are demanding an immediate end to the occupation, and by extension the 
  dismantling of the Oslo "peace process." Seven years after the famous handshake 
  on the White House lawn, the Oslo process has brought no real progress toward 
  a just and lasting peace. Despite the heavy price paid by Palestinians so far, 
  the uprising is unlikely to completely derail the Oslo process so long as the 
  cost of the Israeli occupation does not exceed its benefits. As the Sharm al-Shaykh 
  summit concludes, all signs point toward a turbulent interlude on the way to 
  a new framework agreement that will restore peace to the occupation and its 
  beneficiaries. Whether or not such an agreement will hold remains an open question, 
  but the events of the past weeks have shown that any agreement within the framework 
  of continued military occupation is at best an armed and temporary truce. A 
  <p>FATAL "WRONG TURN" <p>The events of the Independence Uprising--as Palestinians 
  are increasingly calling their 20-day revolt--cast grave doubt on Arafat's ability 
  to enforce quiet without resorting to violence of his own. US and Western media 
  widely reported the October 12 killing of two Israelis at the PA police headquarters 
  for the Ramallah/al-Bira district. According to Israel, the men in question 
  were army reservists reporting for duty who took a "wrong turn" on their way 
  to a military base, passed an Israeli roadblock unnoticed and unintentionally 
  entered Area A--the territory under Palestinian security control. Palestinians 
  dismiss this explanation, insisting the two were members of an undercover unit 
  on active duty. Certainly, the numerous road signs in Hebrew at entrances to 
  Ramallah make it hard to believe that the soldiers simply missed their turn. 
  <p>There are too many competing versions of subsequent events to establish definite 
  facts at this stage. But it is clear that news of the Israeli soldiers' apparent 
  arrest quickly reached a funeral procession then underway for a Palestinian 
  officer shot dead the previous night. Hundreds of outraged mourners, a good 
  portion of whom had one day earlier also participated in the funeral of a villager 
  who had been tortured, murdered and mutilated by Jewish settlers, set upon the 
  police station where the Israelis were being held. Demonstrators quickly overpowered 
  the guards, climbed to the second floor where the Israelis were being held and 
  beat them to death. One of the bodies was subsequently thrown out of the window, 
  where a furious mob mutilated it further before dragging it through the street. 
  Crucially, Palestinian and Israeli security sources concur that Palestinian 
  policemen did not participate in the killings and in fact sought to protect 
  the Israelis in their custody. <p>Israel did not wait for an investigation of the 
  incident to respond with overwhelming force. Later that afternoon, Israeli Cobra 
  attack helicopters launched simultaneous missile strikes against al-Bira, Bait 
  Lahia, Gaza City and Ramallah. The targets included Yasser Arafat's West Bank 
  and Gaza Strip headquarters, various buildings associated with the Palestinian 
  security forces, a Fatah office in Gaza City, Palestinian Broadcasting Company 
  facilities and the Gaza port. That evening, Israeli helicopters conducted additional 
  strikes on Hebron, Jericho, Nablus, Rafah, Salfit and Tulkarm. <p>IMBALANCE OF 
  POWER<p> The October 12 killings and bombing fanned the flames of the uprising 
  sparked by Ariel Sharon's entry into the Haram al-Sharif compound in Jerusalem 
  with the full backing of the minority Labor government. At first, vocal, nonviolent 
  protest of Sharon's visit was led by a coalition of Palestinian leaders from 
  the Occupied Territories and Palestinian members of the Israeli Knesset. The 
  following day, seven Palestinians (including a resident of Umm al-Fahm within 
  Israel) were shot dead within the Haram al-Sharif by Israeli troops. By September 
  30, the flames had spread to most cities within the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
  and Palestinian communities within Israel experienced their most severe confrontations 
  since the establishment of the Jewish state. <p>Within an additional week, numerous 
  villages became actively involved as well, a development which in both 1936 
  and 1988 signified the transition from popular uprising to sustained rebellion. 
  Most clashes have pitted civilian demonstrators armed with stones and Molotov 
  cocktails against Israeli soldiers firing tear gas, rubber-coated steel bullets 
  and live ammunition, including high-velocity bullets which fragment upon impact. 
  Where such confrontations escalate, and in those instances where armed Palestinians 
  have become involved, Israel has deployed heavy machine guns, tanks and attack 
  helicopters. Israeli soldiers most often fire from reinforced concrete bunkers 
  where they are in no physical danger. The widespread use of snipers, in combination 
  with the large and growing proportion of head and chest wounds sustained by 
  unarmed demonstrators, reinforces Palestinians' conclusion that Israel is applying 
  a "shoot to kill" policy.<p> ARAFAT AND THE PALESTINIAN STREET <p>Israel claims that 
  Arafat instructed the dominant Palestinian political faction, Fatah, to incite 
  the Palestinian public to demonstrate and throw stones at soliders. The uprising 
  is unquestionably being led by Fatah and its cadres have played a greater role 
  in the armed clashes than the PA security forces. But Fatah's ability to mobilize 
  the Palestinian street was circumscribed by widespread disillusionment with 
  the PA and a more general political apathy. No less importantly, there is nothing 
  Yasser Arafat could have said or done to incite Palestinians more than Israel 
  and its actions. Fatah's success in sustaining the uprising reflects above all 
  the cumulative popular anger at continuing Israeli impunity in the Occupied 
  Territories--driven home today when Jewish settlers at the village of Beit Furik 
  near the West Bank town of Nablus killed an unarmed Palestinian man harvesting 
  olives--and only secondarily reflects Fatah's ability to channel this anger. 
  <p>The degree of Arafat's authority and control over Fatah is another unanswered 
  question. The "tanzim" routinely touted in the Israeli and foreign media does 
  not exist as a separate, paramilitary force within Fatah. Rather, the "tanzim" 
  and Fatah are one and the same: Oslo's failure to deliver on basic Palestinian 
  national rights has enhanced the role of the more skeptical, activist wings 
  of the movement. Furthermore, the current uprising has pushed militant local 
  leaders to the forefront of decision-making. Today the secretary-general of 
  Fatah in the West Bank, Marwan Barghouthi, bitterly criticized the outcome of 
  the summit and promised a renewed "peaceful intifada." <p>OSLO: DOWN BUT NOT OUT? <p>
  Today's summit agreement shows that the Oslo process has so far survived the 
  uprising and Israel's unprecedentedly direct attacks on the PA, if barely. Whether 
  by design or default, Israel and the PA are now vying for advantages at the 
  negotiating table. While the Oslo framework for Israeli-Palestinian relations 
  has undergone severe strain, it has remained intact because neither Israel nor 
  the PA have a viable alternative. Even if Arafat unilaterally proclaims an independent 
  Palestinian state on November 15, Israel will eventually acquiesce: Arafat's 
  state will be primarily symbolic and will complement the Israeli-American proposals 
  made at Camp David. On the Israeli side, a Labor-Likud coalition government, 
  should one emerge, is highly unlikely to risk the international isolation which 
  would result from abrogating the Oslo process. A two-state solution under Oslo's 
  terms serves Israel's local, regional and international interests and leaves 
  it in effective control of the Occupied Territories. But as the current events 
  demonstrate, such solutions are little more than recipes for further violence.
