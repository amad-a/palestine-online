<h3> KID SISTER</h3>
<p> Israel Shamir
<p> February 17
 


<p>
After the last episode of the 'Fateful Elections', the actors amiably

shared the trophies backstage. The muse of Israeli politics, like

Coca-Cola, wishes to please everybody. Whoever thought that 
Barak was

the best candidate, will be pleased to have him back in power as 
the

Minister of Defense. Those who were about to get nostalgic for 
Shimon

Peres, and were upset that he was not allowed to run, will have 
Peres

in the secondbest bed, as Shakespeare's widow. And yesterday's 
monster

Sharon has miraculously evolved into a wise statesman. It really did

make no sense to vote.

<p>

The elections were a sham, but the siege of Palestinian villages is

very real. Soldiers, who can't find enough demonstrators for target

practice, shoot at passenger cars. Gaza is awash with a new sort of

gas. Israeli tanks barrage suburbs of Bethlehem. A UN commission, sent

to investigate the war crimes, received the short shrift: how dare

they speak of war crimes? The Mitchell commission also got brushed

aside last week. As the response, the US warplanes bombed : Iraq

(surely some mistake?)


<p>
Innocent outsiders must question how Israel can get off scot-free with

war crimes and receive the blessings of the US congress as a bonus?

Could it be the Divine intervention? The answer is no. There is

another agent to thank for this state of affairs. We, Israelis, enjoy

full immunity, and have no doubt, if and when our government decides

to turn the Palestinians into canned meat, the New York Times will

celebrate its nutritional values. If that is their intent, they should

hasten the process, because with the present blockade, the

Palestinians are losing weight with every passing day.

<p>

All is fine on the Israeli side of the barricades. The Israeli shekel

remains strong. Even George Soros knows that it would not be healthy

to take a position against it. The Tel Aviv stock exchange rallies on

the news that Intel has decided to invest a cool five billion dollars

in Israel.  The beauty of it all is that the siege of the Palestinians

and the prosperity of Tel Aviv are maintained at the expense of the

American taxpayer and investor. Since 1967, we have received some 170

billion dollars from the people of the US. This money could be used to

feed and school all the underprivileged kids of America. It could pay

to compensate the descendants of the African slaves and help them out

of their hardship. It could save the sick and comfort the miserable;

it could turn Africa into a paradise. But it was kidnapped and shipped

to our shores. Every dollar invested by the Israeli lobby into

senators and congressmen has been returned a hundred fold, as promised

by the Bible.

<p>

Besides the taxpayer's money, the supporters of Israel - business

executives - invested billions of dollars that their shareholders

entrusted them with. There is no sound business reason behind Intel's

investment, or other similar investments - Israel has no pool of

qualified workers, they have to be imported like everything else. The

risk of the investments in our country is great and the profits are

meager. But then again, they are playing with somebody else's money.

<p>

Israel's supporters fleece America in a grand way, but they also go

after other prey. In England, a Czech Jewish emigre who adopted the

name of Robert Maxwell, stole millions of dollars from the pension

funds of his British employees and shipped the money to Israel. He was

found dead in suspicious circumstances, but Israel never refunded the

stolen goods. In another English scandal, Dame Shirley Porter,

daughter of salesman Jack Cohen, the supermarket chain owner and the

one-time mayor, misappropriated 50 million dollars and presented

lavish gifts to the Tel Aviv University, built on the ruins of the

destroyed Palestinian village of Sheikh Munis. She was found guilty by

the British High Court and sentenced to the fine of 27 million pounds.

As all her property had already been transferred to Israel, the fine

remains unpaid. Again, Israel did not return the stolen goods.

<p>

Moving on to France, a group of Israeli and local Jewish financiers

transferred to Israel some 40 million of public funds and disappeared

to Tel Aviv. A Russian Jew and Israeli citizen Lev Cherny, a great

supporter of Yeltsin's democracy, 'privatized' the Russian aluminum

industry, which has the biggest reserves in the world. Now the income

from that industry flows directly to lovely Savion, the Beverly Hills

of Israel. While back in the frozen wastes of Siberia, the population

has been reduced to poverty. The Swiss and the Germans keep paying

umpteen billions of dollars to Israel for the confiscated property of

Jews, though Israel never paid even one penny for the confiscated

Gentile property. The Europeans meekly comply under threat of the

toughest of brothers Cray, the mightiest enforcer of Jewish loans, the

US.

<p>

Israel's supporters overseas are like a giant Hoover machine, sucking

out money and sweat from all over the world. Witness Mark Rich, the

thieving billionaire, pardoned by the best supporter of Israel, Bill

Clinton? He was a Mossad agent. Remember Fujimori, a thieving

ex-president of Peru? Israeli banks helped him to launder the money.

Sometimes, the Palestinians and their friends bemoan their inability

to build up their own Arab lobby to counteract the Israeli lobby. They

miss the most important point. The Israeli lobby should not be just a

Palestinian concern, but the concern of all Americans. When oil runs

out of a tanker's hulk, it should concern the crew and the owners, not

only the fish. Israel's supporters swindle all Americans of their

money, and antagonize America's potential friends abroad. Many

American politicians support the swindle in order to remain in power.

For personal political ambitions, they betray the trust of their

voters.


<p>
John F. Kennedy told Gore Vidal, that in 1948, Harry Truman was on the

verge of losing the presidential election, but a Zionist supporter

brought to him 2 million dollars cash and saved his skin. It caused

America to vote for the creation of the Jewish State. This pattern

perpetuates itself. The politicians take bribes, sell pardons, accept

'donations', and help the Israeli lobby to rob the people of America.

<p>

The actual direct contribution of American Jews for the welfare of

Israel is quite small and tax exempt. It would hardly cover the cost

of the missiles and nerve gas to kill Palestinians, much less support

the Israeli life style to which we have become accustomed. But what

Israel supporters collect in campaign contributions is enough to bribe

politicians and embezzle a good chunk of American money from the US

treasury.  If such a swindle would be hatched by, say, the Libyan

lobby, the media would rightly demand these people be registered as

foreign agents of influence. That is where the Israeli lobby cashes in

on the solidarity of the many American Jews and right-wing Christian

Zionists in the national media.

<p>

Ahmed Amr, an independent journalist from Seattle, Washington, has

lamented the total absence of the Arab-Americans in the American

media, saying 'Could it be, that like white men can't jump, the

Arab-Americans can't write? Could it be that mainly Jewish gentlemen

can write?' Well, he should know better. Even Jews, who can write but

fail to support Israel, are also deprived of access to the national

mainstream media. Israel's supporters have silenced the voice of

Americans who would speak up for the Palestinians, including notable

Jewish intellectuals like Chomsky. They silenced also the "native"

voice of Americans. The stock exchange rises and falls, but there is

no new Faulkner out of the South, no new Cheever in New England, no

new John Barth from Maryland. The Hollywood-made films have degraded

into sheer escapism and production of Arab-hate crap.


<p>
The enemy of Palestinians and of ordinary Americans, British and

French citizens is not 'the Jew', as some people tend to think. There

are thousands and thousands of wonderful folk of Jewish descent -

doctors, artists, rabbis, unemployed. A lot of them object to Israeli

crimes and to AIPAC policies. Some of them are on the front line of

the struggle for human rights. Now the time has come for us to stand

up and be counted.


<p>
The hesitating American Jews are in the position of the elder sister

in Raymond Chandler's Big Sleep, who covers up the crimes of her wild

kid sister. Probably you remember it by one of the best American

movies of all times, scripted by William Faulkner, directed by Howard

Hawks and acted by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. As the cover up

continues, the young sister comes to believe that she has immunity and

keeps on her killing spree. Eventually her crimes endanger the

seemingly secure position of the elder sister. It is not a day too

early for misguided Lauren to call for Bogart and to rein the crazed

youth in, before she will bring the house down on the heads of her

blind supporters.


<p>
In spiritual terms, the blind support of Israel divided the Jews into

the sheep and the goats (Mt 25:32), into sons of saints and sons of

Mamon worshippers, the descendants of prophets and of their killers,

those who profess unity of mankind and adepts of national exclusivity,

those who wait for the saviour of man and those who expect the

enslaver of gentiles. The former ones will make the name of Jews

blessed, but those who would partake in the starving of poor peasants

under Israeli-imposed siege, those who would let them rot in jails,

they will certainly bring shame to all of us.

<p>

The covenant of Israel's supporters is not an ethnic monolith. It

admits Gentiles, as well; it is enough to disregard the poor, the

weak, the oppressed, and you can enter it. On the other hand, every

Jew can opt out of it by rejecting Israeli crimes. There is no

biological guilt or virtue. The believing Jews of Naturei Karta opted

out and supported the Palestinian right to life. So did Jews for

Justice, and many others who did not care to join a political group,

but stood away from evil. Wise French noblemen opted out of the

Ancienne Regime in 1789; they did not wait for the 'national razor' of

1793.

<p>

It is in interests of Americans, Jews and Gentiles alike, to start

with a full embargo of Israel. The idea of an exclusive Jewish state

is as wrong as the idea of an exclusive Aryan or White State.

Palestine/Israel should become a democracy based on the principle of

ONE MAN - ONE VOTE. Do not worry for us, Israelis and Palestinians, -

we, the sons of Abraham, can live together. Just cut off the supplies

to the Generals' Junta, and we shall see the light.



<p>A democratic Israel/Palestine will turn off the Zionist Hoover

machine. The long madness of Don Quixote will be over, and he will be

called again Don Quexana the Good. The fruits of labor will come to

those who need it, not to Israeli generals. Americans will again

become welcome guests in the Middle East. Who knows, maybe even the

great American cinema will be reborn from its golden ashes.
