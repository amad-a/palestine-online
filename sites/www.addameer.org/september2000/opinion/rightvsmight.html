<h3>PALESTINIAN RIGHT vs. ZIONIST MIGHT</h3>



 <p>
Nizar Sakinini



<p>The recent round of violence in Palestine started as a direct reaction 
to the orchestrated provocative visit of Ariel Sharon to Haram al 
Sharif. The visit was the spark that triggered the explosion. However, its 
real causes go back to the mid-Nineteenth century when the early seeds 
of the Zionist-
Arab conflict were sown.

<p>Looking at what's going on in the area as a result of specific recent 
actions and/or reactions is too simplistic.

<p>Referring to the Palestinian anger as an outcome of orchestrated 
incitement by Arafat to gain political dividends reflects Israeli 
government's arrogance and blindness and the inability to admit the truth and act 
accordingly.

<p>Use of tanks and military helicopters to fire missiles against angry 
and frustrated civilians protesting the continued oppression, 
dispossession, humiliation and all kinds of human rights violations that was part 
and parcel of the Zionist colonization settlement in Palestine all 
along, reflects 
the only language supporting Zionist claims: brutal force. 

<p>Zionist successes, so far, were the result of the use of brutal force 
with full and unconditional support of the Western Imperialist and 
Colonialist powers who entered with the Zionist movement into an agreement 
that was reflected in the Balfour Declaration. According to this 
Imperialist-Zionist 
agreement, the "Exclusive Jewish State" would form an outpost for 
Western imperialists in the area in return for the unlimited Imperialist 
support to the Zionists for the mutual benefit of both parties.

<p>This is the crux of the problem that led to mistrust and walls of 
hatred between the two peoples and led to the bloodshed and the tragic, 
regrettable and condemnable loss of life on both sides.

<p>The Israeli side has the might. On the other hand, the Palestinian side 
has the right. Israeli might could never be able to create a friendly 
atmosphere that would lead to a peaceful co-existence and neighborhood. 
Admitting the wrong done by denial of the Palestinian right and a 
sincere will to c
orrect the wrongdoing is the only way to break the vicious circle of 
violent and bloody reprisals a
nd anti-reprisals with all its tragic consequences.

<p>The following articles were published on page 1 in Yediot Aharonot on 3 
October 2000. The first art
icle reflects a Palestinian point of view while the other article 
reflects a Zionist point of view.
 It is interesting to read them and start a soul searching effort to 
find a way out of the madness 
and insanity that the Zionist-Imperialist "strategic alliance" is 
exploiting to perpetuate their co
ntrol and hegemony in the area at the expense of all the victims 
spelling their blood in this tragi
c conflict.  

<p><b>BARAK'S FAILURE by Azmi Bishara</b> 
<p>Ariel Sharon tested Barak's seriousness regarding Israeli sovereignty 
over the mosques on the Templ
e Mount [Haram al Sharif]. Barak met the challenge and showed how 
serious he was by means of 3,000 
policemen who accompanied the visit.


<p>Barak perhaps passed Sharon's test but failed the test of peace. He 
opened up the question of sover
eignty over the mosques in order to push all of the other questions, 
such as the settlements and th
e refugees, to the sidelines. But in practice he channeled all of the 
contradictions toward the Tem
ple Mount.


<p>Sharon's incursion onto the Temple Mount, with a heavy police detail, 
brought about the explosion t
hat brought all of the contradictions out to the fore and turned into a 
battle against Barak's atte
mpt to dictate the principles of the final status arrangement to the 
Palestinians. This Intifada is
 against Barak's dictates. Over night, the al-Aksa Intifada did away 
with all of Barak's diplomatic
 achievements that he bragged about so much recently.


<p>The Palestinian people are paying a heavy price. It looks like General 
Barak has given General Mofa
z "free rein." The weapons that Israel is using attest to the use of a 
contingency plan that was pr
epared in advance in the event that the Palestinians should declare an 
independent Palestinian stat
e, and was geared to cause a large number of casualties. Israel has not 
balked at using combat heli
copters or rockets, just as it has not balked at shooting directly at 
12 year olds and infants only
 a year and a half old. This is the first time that the Arab public in 
Israel has gone to the stree
ts en masse in such a manner, and over an issue that does not directly 
affect it or its rights. The
 Arab public wanted to protest Israel's brutal behavior toward 
Palestinian civilians and to place d
irect pressure on the government on the issue of al-Aksa.


<p>The Arab citizens of Israel have now taken a position of dual 
responsibility. The Arab citizens exp
ress political solidarity with the Palestinian people's struggle for a 
just solution against Barak'
s dictates, both as citizens and as members of the Palestinian people. 
Instead of a dual identity, 
we have here dual responsibility. This is an important political change 
whose importance must not b
e underestimated.


<p>Police Minister, Professor Ben-Ami, gave Alik Ron the very same "free 
rein" that Mofaz received in 
the [occupied] territories. The Arabs' right to block roads and to 
demonstrate has been refused the
m and the "enlightened" Professor Ben-Ami backs up Alik Ron, who wants 
to use force in order to rea
lize his theories. The results are catastrophic: policemen firing 
rubber-coated bullets and live am
munition at demonstrators in Umm el-Fahm, Sakhnin and Nazareth -- 
firing and killing. Sharpshooters
 killed an innocent boy in a demonstration in Jat.

<p>Just as Israel began a new chapter by declaring war on the Intifada 
instead of repressing it, so ha
ve the Israeli Police begun a new chapter in violence against the Arab 
public and its oppression.  


<p><b>WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE by Ariel Sharon</b> 
<p>Everything is burning and the citizens of Israel are arguing as to what 
caused the escalation - ins
tead of standing together facing the danger. The Jews, as they are wont 
to do, are looking for othe
r Jews to blame.


<p>The chief of staff and the chief of police have already stated that 
what is going on here is an "al
l out campaign" by the PA. Under the leadership of Arafat and at his 
instructions, the Palestinians
 want to achieve more than what the Israeli government is willing to 
give. And being Arafat, he doe
s this through violence. He is joined by the principal inciters - Arab 
MKs and members of anti-Isra
eli and anti-Zionist parties. They are working together - both in 
Kalkilya near Kfar Saba and Kocha
v Yair, as well as in Jerusalem, Netzarim, Wadi Ara, Nazareth and Jaffa 
- and are blocking the main
 arteries throughout the country. They go to the intersections and 
attack the security forces. Betw
een throwing firebombs at Megiddo intersection and shooting at police 
in Umm el-Fahm, they mislead 
and cry.


<p>I sent a letter yesterday to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
whose spokesman erred and did no
t know the whole truth, as he was fed by Palestinian propaganda backed 
up by ministers Dalia Itzik,
 Yossi Beilin and Shlomo Ben-Ami, and MK Yossi Sarid. Even when 
everything is burning they do not h
esitate to once again join wild Palestinian incitement.


<p>It was not the visit to the Temple Mount that lit the fire. The fire 
was lit by Arafat already ten 
days ago. It began at Netzarim and spread. Beyond that, as an Israeli 
citizen, I am allowed to visi
t all places. I do not need any special permission, as does not Ahmed 
Tibi or any other MK who wish
es to visit the Western Wall or Yad Vashem without asking permission. 
It is every individual's righ
t to visit any place in the country that is under Israeli sovereignty. 
The Prime Minister made this
 perfectly clear. All of Jerusalem is Israeli sovereign territory and 
the Temple Mount is a holy si
te, the most sacred to Jews all over the world.


<p>I regret the casualties on both sides, but we must remember that this 
is a struggle whose results w
ill decide to what degree Israel will continue to maintain its 
character as a Jewish and democratic
 state, in the spirit of the declaration of independence. There are 
those who want it to be somethi
ng else: certainly not a Jewish state; but it is not certain that, 
under the conditions that will b
e created, it will be a strong democratic state that can protect the 
lives of all its citizens and 
their basic rights. Despite the violent events, I still believe that 
peace can be achieved, and tha
t we can coexist with our Arab neighbors.


<p>But a peace that can last for generations can only come about when the 
Palestinians cease using vio
lence and terror and recognize the historic and legitimate rights of 
the Jews in their country, in 
their undivided capital and over the Temple Mount, the root of the 
existence of the Jewish people. 
Peace can be achieved, but not at the price of collective suicide. 


</P>
