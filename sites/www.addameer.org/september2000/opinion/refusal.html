<h3>Al-Aqsa Intifada: The Refusal to Surrender</h3>
<p> Dr. Majed Nassar, Union of Health Work Committees
<br>Nassar Ibrahim, Alternative Information Center
<p>3 November 2000






<p>The present Intifada is based on a number of political realities that
form a framework within which we can understand more fully the 
events
of the past four weeks in the Palestinian occupied territories.  

<p>Before beginning an analysis of these realities, however, it must be
clearly stated that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and 
Gaza
is the sole entity responsible for the Aqsa Intifada.  The same
occupation has been implementing a policy of terror for years 
toward
the Palestinian people including arrests, deportations, killings, and
robbery of the national economy, in addition to the confiscation of
lands and building of settlements.   This same occupying force still
refuses to acknowledge the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people, namely, the right for self-determination, the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, and the right for all
refugees to return.

<p>The spark that ignited this Intifada, moreover, was the provocative
visit of Ariel Sharon, accompanied by hundreds of Israeli soldiers, to
Al Haram A-Sharif.   Any attempt to minimize this fact, or to explain
the events in any other way would be a deception.   

<p>A Refusal to Surrender

<p>There has been an increasing loss of confidence in the peace process
designed according to the American-Israeli vision, which implies the
exclusive implementation of Israeli terms.  These terms include:

<p>a. the separation of the geographic and demographic unity of the
Palestinian people by dividing their land into cantons A, B, and C, in
addition to the creation of bypass roads that have consumed thousands
of dunums of Palestinian lands;<p> b. the building and expansion of new
settlements; <p>c. the continuing siege over Palestinian cities,
villages, and camps; <p>d. the policy of house demolitions; <p>e. the
rejection of Palestinian basic human rights as well as national
rights;<p> f. the use of Palestinian prisoners as a bargaining chip for
more concessions.

<p>In addition, Israel continually refuses to comply with international
resolutions (United Nations and UN Security Council) and has replaced
these international terms of reference with its own force, and the
creation of "facts on the ground."  Israel depends exclusively on the
completely biased American position which supports and whitewashes
Israel's practices against the Palestinian people.  The United States,
moreover, continues to threaten to use its veto power against any
attempt to condemn Israeli crimes.

<p>The recent events, as well as the results of seven years of the Oslo
Agreement fiasco and all the subsequent "agreements," are nothing but
tools to eliminate the rights of the Palestinian people.  None of
these agreements have been effective means to achieve a just peace in
the region.
 <p>The extreme violence used by Israel against the Palestinian uprising
 is
nothing but another attempt to coerce the world into buying into its
understanding of "peace," namely, a peace based on surrender.

<p>Israel's Intransigence

<p>Although Israel presents itself as a party willing to make
compromises, in reality, the "facts on the ground" illustrate clearly
its complete intransigence with respect to any and all negotiations.  
Barak went to Camp David (the beginning of the final status
negotiations) and brought with him the following conditions on the
Israeli agenda:  

<p>a. No withdrawal to the borders of 6 June 1967 (this contradicts UN
resolutions 242 and 338);<p> b. The insistence that the settlements
should remain and be annexed to Israel (this also contradicts all UN
and UN Security Council resolutions which consider all settlements on
the West Bank and in Gaza illegal); <p>c. The denial of the rights of
Palestinian people in East Jerusalem and dealing with Jerusalem in
toto as the eternal capital of Israel; <p>d. The refusal to allow
Palestinians to return to the homes from which they have been expelled
since 1948 (contradiction of UN Resolution 194); <p>e. Israel's refusal
to have a "foreign" army west of the Jordan River. This implies that
if Israel ever accepts the creation of a Palestinian state
(constrained, of course, by the conditions previously mentioned), it
must necessarily be a state without an army.

<p>It is important to understand the significance of some of these
conditions for Palestinians.  The settlements are an Israeli political
project aimed at crushing Palestinian aspirations for freedom and
independence.  Any realistic discourse focused on the creation of a
Palestinian state with the coexistence of the settlements and bypass
roads would imply a state without sovereignty.  This has always been
one of the main reasons for conflict and confrontation.  Israel's
vision of annexing the already-existing settlements translates into
annexation of an additional 15% of Palestinian lands.  At present,
there are approximately 200,000 settlers in 140 settlements throughout
the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem.  In Hebron, for example, 400 Jewish
settlers live in the midst of 140,000 Palestinians, and control 20% of
the city.
<p>
Israel's expansionist, colonialist policy is a rejection of all
decisions of the international community that state unequivocally that
all settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are illegal and as such must
be dismantled.

<p>The refugee problem is another basic issue at the heart of the
Palestinian cause.  Refugees were created as a direct result of the
Zionist project in Palestine.  Seventy-eight percent of Palestine was
occupied in 1948 and as a result, approximately one million
Palestinians were made refugees. During the 1967 War, another half a
million refugees were added to this number.  Today there are
approximately 4 million refugees living in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan,
as well as in Palestine itself. 

<p>These are the facts and the foundation upon which the present Intifada
was built.   The only conclusion to be drawn from all this is that,
although Israel speaks eloquently about peace, it acts as a brutal
occupying force on the ground that will stop at nothing to maintain
its power.  Oslo aided the Israeli occupation army in tightening its
grip on each and every Palestinian city and village.  In addition, the
plans for redeployment as articulated in Oslo have only served to
improve Israel's strategic military positions rather than precipitate
its withdrawal, as some people erroneously imagined. The recent summit
at Sharm a-Sheikh on 17 October, with Clinton, Mubarak, Annan, Solana,
Arafat, and Barak was yet another step in perpetuating the deception
that has dominated all attempts to deal rationally with the conflict. 
 <p>The Summit described the Palestinian resistance as simple rioting
rather than as the profound expression of the aspirations of an entire
population for freedom and independence.  The Sharm-a Sheikh Summit
and its results were clearly controlled by the U.S. vision for "peace"
in the region -- a vision that would crush the Palestinian Intifada,
block the Arabic national movement, and hinder the broadening of
solidarity movements in Europe and elsewhere in the world.  One of the
most dangerous consequences of the Summit is the equalization of the
victim and the victimizer and the effort to ignore the liberation
movement's political dimension underlying the action of the
Palestinian people.  In addition, Sharm a-Sheikh was an attempt to
transform the reality of Israeli brute force into political
"achievement" in order to dictate Israel's political conditions in any
future agreements.

<p>Al-Aqsa Intifada: Unprecedented Palestinian Unity

<p>The present Intifada is distinguished by a unique unanimity of intent
and motivation among all sectors of Palestinian society.  
Palestinians on the streets of Gaza, Jerusalem, and the West Bank are
using similar slogans to express their state of despair and their loss
of confidence in the peace process.  Since 1993, the Palestinians have
experienced first-hand the fact that the present political settlement
is nothing but a dictation of Israeli terms, namely, a continuation of
the occupation with settlement expansion, a "state" comprised of
bantustans, and no right to return. Palestinians have united, not only
in the West Bank and Gaza, but also (and for the first time), with the
Palestinians living inside the Green Line as well as with those living
in refugee camps in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. 

<p>Since 1948, Israel has tried to isolate the Palestinians inside the
Green Line from the rest of the Palestinian people and has dealt with
them as "Israeli Arabs."  Despite this, however, the Palestinians from
1948 have entered fully into the present Intifada.  Their
participation in Al-Aqsa Intifada is a deep acknowledgement of their
belonging to the Palestinian people.  It is part of an Intifada for
themselves and a means to fight for their rights.  

<p>The entire Palestinian people painfully remembers that in 1948, Israel
occupied 80% of Palestine and continues to today its policy of
confiscating what remains.   For this reason, the Palestinians are
united on the following principles:

<p>a. negotiations based on imbalance of power and American bias must be
stopped; <p>b. the Palestinian cause must be a priority on the agenda of
the international community; <p>c. there can be no political settlement
without Jerusalem; <p>d. all settlements must be dismantled immediately
<p>e. all cooperation with the occupying power on security arrangements
must come to a halt; <p>f. continuation of the present negotiations will
not bring about even the minimum with respect to ensuring the basic
rights of Palestinians, so our choice is to continue the resistance
movement.

<p>Israel's Strategy of Confrontation: "Bring Them to Their Knees"

<p>Palestinians throughout the world are committed to reaffirming their
inalienable, national rights.  Sharon's intention, with the blessing
of the Israeli government, was to create yet another "fact on the
ground."  This alone is sufficient to explain Israel's violent
reaction toward the Palestinian demonstrators protesting Sharon's
visit.   Barak's government wanted to deliver a clear message to the
Palestinian people that Israel is ready to do everything necessary to
protect its own political choice and to safeguard Israel's conditions
defined by Barak at the Camp David Summit. If Israel has its way,
then, the Palestinians are either to kneel and accept Israeli terms,
or to be subject to Israeli terror and killing.

<p>Israeli army tactics thus far have been "hidden" under the cover of
political and security "considerations" - in other words, use the
utmost level of force, as quickly as possible, in order to crush the
Palestinian resistance.  In this way, the Intifada will lose its
momentum, thus ensuring the attainment of Israeli goals and rendering
impotent the Palestinians.

<p>Israel's strategy in dealing with the Intifada is connected to three
elements: 

<p>a. Maintaining Israeli force through ensuring the highest possible
number of losses among Palestinian demonstrators and the least
possible in the Israeli army; <p>b.  Tightening the grip and siege over
Palestinian cities and villages, as well as severely restricting
freedom of movement through the Israeli army's complete control of all
roads.  <p>c. Encouraging settlers throughout the West Bank and Gaza to
attack Palestinian villages; <p>d. Attempting to portray the
confrontations as a confrontation with a real armed Palestinian force,
although Israel knows very well, the kinds of weapons that are in the
possession of the Palestinian police.  Israel, nevertheless, has used
this argument as a cover and an excuse for its disproportionate use of
combat helicopters, rockets, and tanks.

<p>The Bottom Line

<p>Confronted with this reality, Arafat  has found himself in front of
yet another closed door.  Any further compromise on the basic points
of the final status negotiations would mean defeat in the struggle
toward gaining recognition of the legitimate rights of Palestinians. 
No Palestinian would stand for it. 

<p>The demands of the Palestinian people are very simple and clear:  

<p>a. end the occupation
<p>b. dismantle all settlements
<p>c. grant freedom and independence to Palestinians in a sovereign
state, with Jerusalem as its capital <p>d. guarantee the right of return
to all refugees

<p>The Palestinian people seek a just political solution that brings
refugees back to their homes.  They seek a just political solution
that guarantees freedom and independence for the entire Palestinian
people, and not a new, creative form of occupation.  This is the
reason that the conflict continues and the resistance gets stronger. 
And this is the reason that the Israeli occupation, with its tactics
of terror and aggression, will never be able to crush the Palestinian
spirit and longing for justice.
