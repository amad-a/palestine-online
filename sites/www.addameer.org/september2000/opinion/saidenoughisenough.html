<h3> The tragedy deepens </h3>
<p>By Edward Said 

  
 




<p>
No one really knows whether the Al-Aqsa Intifada temporarily subsided 
because Yasser Arafat expressed his public disapproval of it on 17 
November or whether the lull was only a short-lived one that was 
generated out of fatigue or a search for new positions. Despite the 
enormous cost in lives and property to Palestinians, however, the 
essential problems remain, and the Israelis continue their blind and 
finally stupid assault on Palestinians with the strangulation, 
economic blockade, and bombings of cities and towns continuing without 
respite. 
<p>
Every Arab leader who welcomed Barak's election a year and a half ago 
should now be asked to repeat his declarations so that their 
hollowness can be demonstrated again and again. I find official Arab 
attitudes virtually incomprehensible, having spent most of my life 
trying to decipher them according to the laws of reason and elementary 
common sense. Did they seriously believe that Barak was the saviour of 
the peace process, and if so weren't they aware that to save the peace 
process was nothing less than to prolong the Palestinian agony? Did 
they think that he was any different from the great "war hero" who has 
devoted his entire career to killing Arabs, and if he wasn't why did 
it take them so long to find out? Does subservience to the United 
States require so much subservience, so many acrobatics, such a 
complicated twisting and turning and so profound a prostration? How 
long and for what do they cling to a repressive, basically 
rejectionist status quo with neither the will nor the capacity to wage 
war nor to live in peace, simply to please a distant and arrogant 
superpower that has showed them and their people so much contempt, 
inhumanity and utter, unspeakable cruelty? Can they not do anything 
more substantial than what they are doing when Israel is using 
helicopter gunships to kill Palestinian civilians and destroy their 
homes, while the United States supplies Israel with the largest ever 
order of attack helicopters during the past 10 years and Israel has 
added $500 million to its budget for settlements? Not one word of 
official protest against US policy that has brought such catastrophe 
to our people. It is this timorousness that allows US policy-makers, 
of whom the unregretted Dennis Ross -- the mediocre individual who has 
done more single-handedly to advance Israel's interest than anyone -- 
is but one, to say that the Arabs trust the US and its policies and 
remain close friends and allies of the US. Surely the time has come to 
speak frankly of a hypocrisy and brutality without parallel, instead 
of standing silently by cap in hand as more and more Palestinians are 
killed with arms paid for by US taxpayers. 
<p>
But the core of the tragedy is what is happening to the victims 
themselves, the Palestinian people. Here one must speak and think 
rationally, not letting emotion and the passions of the moment sway 
the mind too much. My general impression is that Palestinians 
everywhere feel the absence of real leadership, a voice or an 
authority that can speak both of the present and the future with some 
sense of vision, some articulation of a coherent, inclusive goal 
beyond the usual platitudes that repeat what is obviously designed to 
postpone decisions and visions with mere rhetoric. No one has any 
doubt that Palestinians are struggling against military occupation and 
have been doing so for 33 years. But there are four million refugees 
struggling against exile, in addition to the one million Palestinian 
citizens of Israel who have been living under a regime of racial and 
religious discrimination that has too long been hidden under fatuous 
labels like "Israeli democracy." One of the many problems with Oslo 
has been that Palestinian negotiators focused exclusively on the 
occupation, to the neglect of the other two dimensions. But it should 
finally be clear that in all three instances it is Zionism that we 
fight against, and until we have a leadership that can formulate an 
integrated strategy on all three fronts, we do not have leadership. 
The tragedy is that the Intifada goes, lives tragically lost every 
day, in a political setting or framework that deepens the differences 
between Palestinians instead of bringing them closer together. We need 
a new vision, a new voice, a new truth. <p>

Isn't it now clear that old slogans like "a Palestinian state" or 
"Jerusalem our capital" have brought us to this impasse? Shouldn't we 
expect a real leader to speak to all Palestinians, honestly, 
fearlessly, without duplicity or winks at the US and Israel, and to 
chart a course forward that links together opposition to occupation, 
to exile, and to racial discrimination? Why continue to delude people 
with the empty hope that "struggle," a word which seems to mean that 
others should do the dying, will get the Arab world generally and the 
Palestinians particularly what all have so long wanted? It is nothing 
short of alarming that after more than half a century of blustering, 
of expending blood and treasure, of militarisation, of abrogating 
democracy and the most elementary requirements of citizenship in the 
Arab world, we find ourselves facing the same enemy, the same defeats, 
the same tactical shifts and hypocritical about-faces with the same 
tired arsenal of threats, promises, slogans and clichés, all of which 
have been proved more or less worthless and have produced the same 
failures from 1967 to Amman to October 1973 to Beirut to Oslo? 
<p>
No one can deny that Palestine is an exception to nearly all the 
colonial issues of the past 200 years. It is exceptional, but not 
removed from history. Human history is full of similar, if not 
absolutely the same, instances, and what has surprised me, as someone 
living at a distance from the Middle East but close to it in all sorts 
of ways, is how insulated from the rest of the world we keep 
ourselves, whereas, I believe, a great deal can be learned from the 
history of other oppressed peoples in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and 
even Europe. Why do we resist comparing ourselves, say, with the South 
African blacks, or with the American Indians, or with the Vietnamese? 
By comparing I don't mean mechanically or slavishly, but rather 
creatively and imaginatively. 
<p>
The late Eqbal Ahmad, who was certainly one of the two or three most 
brilliant analysts of contemporary history and politics that I ever 
knew, always drew attention to the fact that successful liberation 
movements were successful precisely because they employed creative 
ideas, original ideas, imaginative ideas where in other less 
successful movements (like ours, alas) there was a pronounced tendency 
to formulas and an uninspired repetition of past slogans and past 
patterns of behaviour. Take as a primary instance the idea of armed 
struggle. For decades we have relied in our minds on ideas about guns 
and killing, ideas that, from the 1930s until today, have brought us 
plentiful martyrs but have had little real effect not so much on 
Zionism but on our own ideas about what to do next. In our case, the 
fighting is done by a small brave number of people pitted against 
hopeless odds, i.e. stones against helicopter gunships, Merkava tanks, 
missiles. Yet a quick look at other movements -- say the Indian 
nationalist movement, the South African liberation movement, the 
American civil rights movement -- tell us first of all that only a 
mass movement employing tactics and strategy that maximise the popular 
element ever made any difference on the occupier and/or oppressor. 
Second, only a mass movement that has been politicised and imbued with 
a vision of participating directly in a future of its own making, only 
such a movement has historical chance of liberating itself from 
oppression or military occupation. The future, like the past, is built 
by human beings. They, and not some distant mediator or saviour, 
provide the agency for change. 

<p>It is clear to me, for example, that the immediate task in Palestine 
is to establish the goal of ridding ourselves of the occupation, using 
imaginative means of struggle. That would necessarily involve large 
numbers of Palestinians intervening directly in the settlement 
process, blocking roads, preventing building materials from entering, 
in other words, isolating the settlements instead of allowing them, 
containing a far smaller number of people, to isolate and surround 
Palestinians, which is what occurs today. It is still true, for 
instance, that the labourers who built the Israeli settlements on a 
daily basis are in fact Palestinians: this should give some fairly 
simple idea of how deeply misled, misguided, under-mobilised and 
unpoliticised the Palestinian people are today. After 33 years of 
building Israeli settlements, Palestinian workers should immediately 
be provided by the Authority with alternative employment. Can't a few 
dollars be spared from the millions spent on useless security and 
unproductive bureaucracy? This is of course a failing of the 
leadership, but in the end it is also those individuals who know 
better -- professionals, intellectuals, teachers, doctors and so on -- 
who have the power of expression and the means to do so who have still 
not put enough pressure on the leadership to make it responsive to the 
situation. 

<p>And there at once is the greatest tragedy of all: a people is giving 
passionately of itself, losing the flower of its youth and all its 
energies in a valiant confrontation with a sadistic and implacably 
cruel enemy who has no compunction about choking Palestinians to 
death, and still Mr Arafat is silent. He has not truly and honestly 
addressed his people since the crisis began, not even a 10-minute 
broadcast to give it strength, to explain his policies, to tell the 
people where we are, how we got here, and where, after all this 
bloodshed and suffering, where we are going. Not one minute of time 
spent telling the truth to his own people, even as he tours the world 
from France to China, meeting with presidents and prime ministers to 
no avail whatever. Is his heart made of stone, is his conscience 
completely anaesthetised? I find this astoundingly incomprehensible, 
and this after 30 years of leading us from one catastrophe and 
ill-considered adventure to another, without respite and without even 
a whispered "thank you for bearing with me and my appalling, bumbling 
mistakes and miscalculations for so long!" I for one am fed up with 
his attitude of contempt for his people, and for his stony autocratic 
imperturbability, his inability either to listen or to take other 
people seriously, his unending ambiguities, secrecy and blindingly 
irrational lurches from one patron to another, all the while leaving 
his long-suffering people to fend for themselves. Lead, Mr Arafat, 
lead your people, and if you can't or don't want to, please say so 
truthfully. But what you have been doing since Oslo began has been to 
mislead, to dodge, to make secret deals that have profited a few of 
the many corrupt politicians who surround you, but have made our 
general situation worse, much worse. 

<p>The Al-Aqsa Intifada is an Intifada against Oslo and against the 
people who constructed it, not only Dennis Ross and Barak, but a 
small, irresponsible coterie of Palestinian officials. These people 
should now have the decency to stand before their people, admit their 
mistakes, and ask (if they can get it) for popular support if there is 
a plan. If there isn't one (as I suspect) they should then have the 
elementary courtesy at least to say so. Only by doing this can there 
be anything more than tragedy at the end of the road. Palestinian 
officials signed the agreement to partition Hebron, they signed many 
other agreements without getting prior assurances that the settlements 
would end (and at least not be increased) and that all signs of 
military occupation would be effaced. They must now explain publicly 
what they thought they were doing and why they did it. Then they must 
let us express our views on their actions and their future. And for 
once they must listen and try to put the general interest before their 
own, despite the millions of dollars they have either squandered or 
squirreled away in Paris apartments and valuable real estate and 
lucrative business deals with Israel. Enough is enough.
