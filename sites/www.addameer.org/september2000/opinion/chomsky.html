<p>
MIT must be relaxing its standards if this many people can show up

right on the eve of finals. 

<p>
Well, just how dangerous is the crisis in the Middle East?  There is a

UN Special Envoy, a Norwegian, Roed-Larson.  A couple of days ago, he

warned that Israel¹s blockade of the Palestinian areas is leading to

enormous suffering and could rapidly detonate a regional war.
<p>

Notice that he referred to the blockade.  He didn¹t refer to the

killings, and the other atrocities.  And he¹s right about that.  The

blockade is the crucial tactic.  There can be a blockade which is very

effective because of the way the so-called Œpeace¹ process has evolved

under U.S. direction, meaning hundreds of isolated Palestinian

enclaves, some of them tiny, which can be blocked off and strangled by

the Israeli occupying forces.  That¹s the basic structure of what¹s

called here the peace process.  So, there can be an extremely

effective blockade.  And a blockade is a sensible tactic for the

United States and Israel, and it¹s always together.  Remember that

anything that Israel does, it does by U.S. authorization, and usually

subsidy and support.

<p>
The blockade is a tactic to fine-tune the atrocities so that they

don¹t become too visible, visible enough to force Washington or the

West (which means Washington essentially) to make some kind of

response.
<p>

There have been mistakes in the past and the United States and Israel

have certainly learned from them.  So in 1996 for example, when Shimon

Peres launched yet another attack on Lebanon, killing large numbers of

people and driving hundreds/thousands out of their home, it was fine

and the U.S. was able to support it and Clinton did support it, up

until one mistake, when they bombed a UN Camp in Qana, killing over a

hundred people who were refugees in the camp.  Clinton at first

justified it, but as the international reaction came in, he had to

back off, and Israel was forced, under U.S. orders in effect, to call

off the operation and withdraw.  That¹s the kind of mistake you want

to avoid.  So, for those of you going into the diplomatic service, you

can¹t allow that kind of mistake to happen.  You want low level

atrocities, fine-tuned, so that an international response is

unnecessary.  [Laughter]

<p>
The same thing happened more recently, just a year ago, last

September, when the U.S.-backed slaughter in East Timor, which had

been going on nicely for about 25 years, finally got out of hand to

such a degree that Clinton was compelled, after the Country was

virtually destroyed, to essentially tell the Indonesian generals that

the game is over, and they instantly withdrew. So that, you want to

avoid.
<p>

In this particular case, there is a clear effort to keep killings,

which is what hits the front pages, at roughly the level of Kosovo

before the NATO bombing.  In fact, that¹s about the level of killings

right now, so that the story will sort of fade into the background.
<p>

Now, of course, the Kosovo story was quite different.  At that time,

the propaganda needs were the opposite.  The killings were under

fairly similar circumstances and the level of Serbian response was

approximately like Israel¹s response in the occupied territories. 

(Then, in fact, there were attacks from right across the border, so it

would be as if Hizbollah was carrying out attacks in the Galili, or

something like that).  That time, the propaganda needs were different,

so therefore, it was described passionately as genocide.  A well

designed propaganda system can make those distinctions. So in that

case it was genocide, and in this case it¹s unnoticeable and justified

reprisal.

<p>
The general idea, and I think you can expect this to continue for

awhile, is for the tactics to be restricted to:  assassination; lots

and lots of people wounded (severely - many of them will die later,

but that doesn¹t enter into consciousness); starvation (according to

the UN, there are about 600,000 people facing starvation, but again

that is below the level); and curfews (24 hour curfews, like in

Hebron, for weeks at a time, while a couple of hundred Israeli

settlers strut around freely, but the rest of the population, tens of

thousands of people, are locked in their homes, allowed out a couple

of hours a week).
<p>

The isolation in the hundreds of enclaves, and so on, is so that

suffering can be kept below the level that might elicit a Western

response. And the assumption, which is pretty plausible, is that there

is a limit to what people can endure, and ultimately they will give

up.

<p>
Well, there is, however, a problem in the Arab world, which is more

sensitive to these massive atrocities, and it could explode, and

that¹s what Roed-Larson is warning about.  The governance in the Arab

world is extremely fragile, especially in the crucial oil producing

region.  Any popular unrest might threaten the very fragile rule of

the U.S. clients, which the U.S. would be unwilling to accept.   And

it might, equally unacceptably, induce the rulers of the oil

monarchies to move to improve relations (particularly with Iran,

which, in fact, they¹ve already been doing), which would undermine the

whole framework for U.S. domination of the world¹s major energy

reserves. 
<p>

Back in 1994, Clinton¹s National Security Advisor, Anthony Lake,

described what he called a paradigm for the post cold war era, and for

the Middle East.  The paradigm was what¹s called ³dual containment²,

so it contains Iraq and Iran, but as he pointed out, dual containment

relies crucially on the Oslo process, the process that brings about

relative peace between Israel and the Arabs.  Unless that can be

sustained, the dual containment can¹t be sustained, and the whole U.S.

current policy for controlling the region will be in serious danger. 

That¹s happened already.

<p>
Just two years ago in December 1998, the U.S. and Britain bombed Iraq

with outright and very explicit contempt for world opinion, including

the UN Security Council.  Remember that the bombing was timed just at

the moment when the Security Council was having an emergency session

to consider the problems of inspection in Iraq, and as they began,

they got the announcement that the U.S. and Britain had pre-empted it

by bombing.  That, and the events before it, lead to a very negative

reaction in the Arab World, and elsewhere for that matter, and did

lead to very visible steps, particularly by the Saudi ruling monarchy,

but also others, towards accommodation to Iran, and indication of some

degree of acceptance of an Iranian position that has been around for

awhile, that there should be a strategic alliance in the region that¹s

independent of Western (meaning primarily U.S.) power. That is

something that the U.S. is highly unlikely to accept and could lead to

very dangerous consequences.

<p>
Furthermore, on top of this, the countries in the region, Iran and

Syria in particular, are testing missiles, which might be able to

reach Israel.  The United States and Israel are working not only on

missiles, but also on an anti-missile system, the Arrow anti-missile

system.  When armaments are at that level, tensions can easily break

out suddenly and unpredictably and lead to a war with advanced

weapons,  which can get out of hand pretty quickly. 

<p>
Well, how dangerous is that?  Turn to another expert, General Lee

Butler, recently retired.  He was head of the Strategic Command at the

highest nuclear agency under Clinton, STRATCOM.  He wrote a couple of

years ago that it¹s dangerous in the extreme that in the cauldron of

animosities that we call the Middle East, one nation has armed itself,

ostensibly with stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the hundreds, and

that inspires other nations to do so as well, and also to develop

other weapons of mass destruction as a deterrent, which is highly

combustible and can lead to very dangerous outcomes.  All of this is

still more dangerous when the sponsor of that one nation is regarded

generally in the world as a rogue state, which is unpredictable and

out of control, irrational and vindictive, and insists on portraying

itself in that fashion.  In fact, the Strategic Command under Clinton

has, in its highest level pronouncement, advised that the United

States should maintain a national persona, as they call it, of being

irrational and vindictive and out of control so that the rest of the

world will be frightened.  And they are.  And the U.S. should also

rely on nuclear weapons as the core of its strategy, including the

right of first use against non-nuclear states, including those that

have signed the Non-Proliferation treaty.   Those proposals have been

built into presidential directives, Clinton-era presidential

directives, that don¹t make much noise around here, but it is

understood in the world, which is naturally impelled to respond by

developing weapons of mass destruction of its own in self defense.   

But these are prospects that are indeed recognized by U.S.

intelligence and high level U.S. analysts.  About two years ago,

Harvard professor Samuel Huntington wrote an article in a very

prestigious journal, Foreign Affairs, in which he pointed out that for

much of the world, he indicated most of the world, the United States

is considered a dangerous rogue state, and the main threat to their

national existence.  And it¹s not surprising, if you look at what

happens in the world from outside the framework of the U.S.

indoctrination system.  That¹s very plausible even from documents, and

certainly from actions, and much of the world does see it that way,

and that adds to the severe dangers of the situation. 

<p>
Well, the recent history of the Middle East provides quite a few

further warnings.  I¹ll just mention one example, which is very

crucial in the present context right now - that¹s 1967, in the June

1967 war when Israel destroyed the Arab armies, the armies of the Arab

states, Egypt most importantly, and it conquered the currently

occupied territories.  That set the stage for what¹s still going on

right now.  At that time, the Soviet Union was still around, and the

conflict there became serious enough so that it almost led to a war ­

a nuclear war, which would have been the end of the story.  Then

Defense Secretary Robert McNamara later observed, in his words, ³we

damned near had war².  At the end of the June war there were hot line

communications, apparently President Kosygin warned that if you want

to have war, you can have it.  There were naval confrontations between

the Russian and the U.S. fleets in the Eastern Mediterranean.

<p>
There was also another case.  There was an Israeli attack on a U.S.

spy ship, USS Liberty, which killed about 35 sailors and crewman and

practically sank the ship.  The Liberty didn¹t know who was attacking

it.  The attackers were disguised.  Before they were disabled, they

got messages back to the 6th Fleet Headquarters in Naples, who also

didn¹t know who was attacking it. They sent out Phantoms, which were

nuclear-armed, because they didn¹t have any that weren¹t

nuclear-armed, to respond to whoever was attacking it, and they didn¹t

know who they were supposed to bomb ­ Russia, Egypt, you know,

anybody.  Apparently the planes were called back directly from the

Pentagon sort of at the last moment.  But that event alone could have

lead to a nuclear war.  
<p>

All of this was understood to be extremely hazardous.  Most of this

probably had to do with Israel¹s plans to conquer the Golan Heights,

which they did after the ceasefire.  And they didn¹t want the United

States to know about it in advance because the U.S. would have stopped

them, and probably that¹s what lies behind most of this.  Documents

aren¹t out, so we can only speculate, and they will probably never

come out.  Anyhow, the situation was ominous enough so that the great

powers on all sides figured that they better put a stop to it, and

they very quickly met at the Security Council and accepted a

resolution, UN 242, the famous UN 242 from November 1967, which laid

out a framework for a diplomatic settlement.
<p>

And it¹s worth paying close attention to what UN 242 was and is.  It¹s

different now from what it was then.  The information about this is

public technically, but barely known and often distorted, so just pay

attention to what it is.  You can easily check it if you like.

<p>
UN 242 called for - the basic idea was full peace in return for a full

withdrawal.  So, Israel would withdraw from the territories that it

just conquered, and in return, the Arab states would agree to a full

peace with it.  There was kind of a minor footnote, that the

withdrawal could involve minor and mutual adjustments.  So, for

example, regarding some line or curve, they could straighten it out,

that sort of thing.  But that was the policy, and that was U.S. policy

- it was under U.S. initiative.  So, full peace in return for full

withdrawal.  Notice that this very crucially, and it¹s very crucial

now, that UN 242 was completely ³rejectionist².

<p>
I use the term ³rejectionist² now in a slightly non-standard sense, in

a non-racist sense.  It is usually used in a completely racist sense. 

So the rejectionists are those who deny Israel¹s right to national

self-determination.  But, of course, there are two national groups

contesting, and I am using the term rejectionist in a neutral sense,

hence non-standard, to refer to a denial of the rights of either of

the two contestants, including denials of Palestinian rights.  That

terminology is never used in the United States, and can¹t be used,

because if it is used, it will turn out that the United States is the

leader of the rejectionist camp, and we can¹t have that.  So therefore

the term is always used in a racist sense.  So, you will understand

that I¹m switching from normal usage now. 
<p>

UN 242 was completely rejectionist.  It offered nothing to the

Palestinians. There was no reference to them, except the phrase that

there was a refugee problem that somehow had to be dealt with.  That¹s

it.  Apart from that, it was to be an agreement among the states.  

The states were to reach full peace treaties in the context of

complete Israeli withdrawal from the territories.  That¹s UN 242.

<p>
Well, without proceeding, for the local people in the region, the

Israelis and the Palestinians, the crisis is obviously extremely

grave.  It could lead to a regional war that could easily escalate to

a global war with weapons of mass destruction with consequences that

are unimaginable, and that could happen at almost any time.

<p>
Secondly, the U.S. role is highly significant.  That¹s always true

throughout the world just because of U.S. power, but it¹s particularly

true in the Middle East, which has been recognized in high level

planning for 50 years (and goes back beyond that, but explicitly for

50 years) as a core element in U.S. global planning.  Just to quote

documents from 50 years ago, declassified documents, the Middle East

was described as the ³strategically most important region of the

world², ³a stupendous source of strategic power², ³the richest

economic prize in the world², and, you know, on and on in the same

vein.  The U.S. is not going to give that up.   And the reason is very

simple.  That¹s the world¹s major energy reserves, and not only are

they valuable to have because of the enormous profit that comes from

them, but control over them gives a kind of veto power over the

actions of others for obvious reasons, which were recognized right

away at the time.  So, that¹s a core issue.  It¹s been the prime

concern of U.S. military and strategic planning for half a century. 

The gulf region, the region of major energy reserves, has always been

the target of the major U.S. intervention forces, with a base system

that extends over a good part of the world, from the Pacific to the

Azores, with consequences for all of those regions because they are

backup bases for the intervention forces targeting the gulf region,

also including the Indian Ocean.

<p>
And this is a big issue right now, in England at least, and much of

the world, but not in the United States.  The inhabitants of an Indian

Ocean island, the Diego Garcia, that were kicked out and

unceremoniously dumped on another island, Mauritius, some years ago,

and those who managed to survive it, have been fighting through the

British Courts (this was a British dependency) to try to gain the

right to return to their homes.  They finally won a couple of months

ago in the High Court in England and were granted the right to return,

except that the U.S. won¹t relinquish the Island, where it has a major

military base that¹s used for the Middle East targeted forces. Just a

couple of days ago, they asked for indemnity of about 6 billion

dollars, and the U.S. is refusing, of course.  Madeline Albright

commented on it.  She said it¹s just an issue between Britain and

Mauritius.  We don¹t have anything to do with it, even though we hold

the Island and refuse to allow them to return, and refuse to pay

indemnities.  I think you¹ll search pretty far to find some discussion

of this in the U.S. press, but that¹s part of the base system for

targeting the Middle East.

<p>
Well, for years, there was a kind of a public pretext for all of this.

 The public pretext was that we had to defend ourselves against the

Russians. That was the pretext for everything, and the pretext for

this in particular. There is a pretty rich internal record, bequest by

documents, which tells quite a different story, however.  The story it

tells is that the Russians were, at most, a marginal factor, often no

factor.  But, fortunately there is no need to debate the matter

anymore because it has been conceded publicly.  It was conceded, in

fact, immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which sort of got

rid of the pretext.  You can¹t appeal to the Russian threat anymore.
<p>

A couple of weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Bush

Administration submitted its annual message to Congress, calling for a

huge military budget, and it was a very interesting document. 

Unfortunately it wasn¹t reported, but it was very important obviously

- the first call for a huge military budget after the fall of the

Berlin Wall, when you can¹t appeal to the Russians anymore.  So,

therefore, it¹s revealing and tells you what¹s really going on.  As

expected, the Russian threat was gone.  We don¹t need a huge Pentagon

budget because of the Russians who aren¹t around anymore, but we still

need it.  In fact, it turned out to be exactly as it was in the past,

and we needed it for reasons which are now frankly expressed.  We

needed it because of what they called the technological sophistication

of Third World countries, which is a way of saying they pose a danger

of becoming independent.  And, we need it because we have to maintain

what¹s called the defense industrial base, which is what pays our

salaries among other things.  The defense industrial base is just a

term for hi-tech industry, which has to be funded by the public, which

has to bear the costs and risks of development.  MIT is one of the

funnels for that.  That has to be maintained.  We have to keep the

source of the dynamic sectors of the economy, which are substantially

in the public sectors, so we have to maintain the defense industrial

base.  And we also have to keep the intervention forces that we¹ve

always had still targeting the Middle East, the gulf region.  Then it

adds (where the threat to our interests that involve possible military

action could not be laid at the Kremlin¹s door ­ contrary to half a

century, forty years, of lies), sorry, folks, we¹ve been lying to you,

but we still need them there because of the technological

sophistication of Third World powers, that is, the threat that they

may become independent.

<p>
Notice that the threat to our interests could also not be laid at

Iraq¹s door at that time because Saddam Hussein was still a nice guy. 

He had only been gassing Kurds, and torturing dissidents, and that

sort of thing.  But he was considered obedient, so he was a friend and

ally.  This is early 1990.  It changed a few months later.

<p>
So, we don¹t have to debate the question of the war with the Russians.

 It¹s now conceded that that was not a significant threat, could not

be laid at the Kremlin¹s door, and the threat, in fact, is what it is

all over the world, and has been right through the cold war, the

threat of what¹s called ³radical nationalism² or ³independent

nationalism².  It doesn¹t make much of a difference where it is in the

political spectrum.  But, if it¹s independent, it¹s a danger and you

have to undermine it as a way of threatening what¹s called stability,

that is, the subordination of the world to the dominant interests that

the U.S. represents.

<p>
Actually U.S. relations with Israel developed in that context.  The

1967 war was a major step forward, when Israel showed its power and

ability to deal with Third World radical nationalists, who were, at

that time, threatening, particularly Nasser.  Nasser was engaged in a

kind of proxy war with Saudi Arabia, which is the most important

country, that¹s where all the oil is, and the Yemen.  And Israel put

an end to that by smashing Nasser¹s armies and won a lot of points for

that, and U.S. relations with Israel really became solidified at that

point.  But it had been recognized 10 years earlier and the U.S.

intelligence had noted that what they called the logical corollary to

opposition to radical Arab nationalism is support for Israel as a

reliable base for U.S. power in the region.  And Israel is reliable

because it¹s under threat, and therefore it needs U.S. support, which

has another logical corollary, that for the U.S. interests¹, it¹s a

good idea for Israel to be under threat.  That essentially continues,

and a good deal of the relationship is based on the way that context

developed. If there was time, I could talk about it, but I¹ll skip it.

<p>
Anyhow, we can thankfully put the pretext aside at this point, and

just look at the reasons which are now on the table - it¹s the threat

of independent nationalism, and in the case of the Gulf region, that¹s

particularly important because that¹s the world¹s major energy

reserves.

<p>
Well, the final consideration, on to the topic, is that the U.S. role

is not the only one, of course.  It¹s one factor in a complicated

mixture, but it is a decisive factor, and crucially, it¹s the one

factor that¹s under our control.  We can directly influence it.  So,

we can bewail the terrible actions of other people, but we can do

something about our own actions. That¹s a rather critical difference,

in personal life and in international affairs.  And it¹s illuminating

to observe how much attention is given to the crimes of others, which

most of the time we can¹t do anything about, and compare it with the

amount of attention that is given to our own crimes, which we can do a

great deal about.  That¹s an instructive comparison, and if you take

the trouble to work it out, you learn a lot about the intellectual

culture in which we live and to which we¹re expected to contribute. 

For that reason alone, and it¹s far from the only one, we ought to be

discussing primarily the U.S. role.  And furthermore, that role is

little understood.  It¹s often just suppressed, which is another

reason to focus on it. 

<p>
Well, let me illustrate the things that are happening right at this

moment. The Intifada, the current uprising, began on September 29th,

that was the day after General Ariel Sharon appeared at the Haram al

Sharif with a lot of troops.  That event alone was provocative, but it

probably would have gone by without any reaction.  What happened the

next day, however, was different.  The next day is the Friday, the day

of prayers, and there was a huge military presence, mostly border

guards who were kind of like the paramilitaries, the ones you farm out

atrocities to, and they were there in force, and as people came out of

the Mosques, it was obviously extremely provocative.  Some rock

throwing took place.  They shot into the crowds, killed four or more

people, wounded over a hundred.  And after that, it just took off. 

This is incidentally Barak, not Sharon.  It¹s easy to blame Sharon,

and there¹s plenty to blame on him for fifty years of atrocities but

this happened to be Barak¹s planning.

<p>
Let me just consider one aspect of what has gone on since, mainly the

use of helicopter gunships.  On October 1st, right after this, Israel

military helicopters, meaning U.S. helicopters with Israeli pilots,

killed two Palestinians in Gaza.  On October 2nd, the next day, they

killed 10 Palestinians, wounded 35 others in Gaza at Netzarim, which

if you follow this closely, you¹ll notice is the scene of many of the

major atrocities, including the famous photo of the 12 year old boy

who was killed.  What¹s Netzarim?  Well, the fact is, Netzarim is just

an excuse to split the Gaza Strip in two.  There¹s a small settlement

south of Gaza, the only purpose of which is to require a big military

outpost to protect it, and the military outpost then requires a road,

a huge road, which cuts the Gaza Strip in two, so that separates Gaza

City, the main population concentration, from the Southern part of the

strip, and Egypt, and insures that in any outcome, Gaza will be

imprisoned inside Israel in effect.   There are other breaks down

farther South, but Netzarim is the main one, and that is where a lot

of the atrocities have been.  So this October 2nd killing of 10 and

wounding of 35 at Netzarim by helicopters is just one of these many

incidents.

<p>
On October 3rd, the next day, the Defense Correspondent of Ha'aretz,

which is the major serious Hebrew newspaper, reported the largest

purchase of military helicopters in a decade ­ that means U.S.

military helicopters. These were Blackhawks, and spare parts for

Apaches.  Apaches are the main attack helicopters.  These had been

delivered a few weeks earlier.  They were getting spare parts, also

jet fuel.

<p>
The next day, October 4th, Jane¹s Defence Weekly, which is the major

military journal in the world, the British military journal, reported

that the Clinton administration had further approved a new sale of

attack helicopters, Apache attack helicopters, because they had

decided that upgrading the ones that they had just sent would not be

sufficient, so they really had to send new, more advanced ones.  The

same day the Boston Globe reported that Apache attack helicopters were

attacking apartment complexes with rockets, again in Netzarim.  The

international press agencies at that time quoted Pentagon officials,

as saying, and I¹m quoting a Pentagon official, ³U.S. weapon sales do

not carry a stipulation that the weapons cannot be used against

civilians.  We cannot second guess an Israeli commander who calls in

helicopter gunships.²   Okay, so, the story so far - U.S. helicopter

gunships are being used to attack civilians, but they aren¹t advanced

enough, and Israel doesn¹t have enough of them, so therefore, the

Clinton administration had to move in with the biggest purchase in a

decade. Purchase means American taxpayers pay for it in some indirect

fashion.  And then it had the next day to extend it further, sending

them more advanced Apache helicopters, and there¹s no stipulation

going along with them that they can¹t be used against civilians. 

Well, that carries us up to October 4th.Then come more and more

attacks on civilians, and I¹ll skip them.
<p>

The first reference in the U.S. press to any of this is on October

12th. There was an opinion piece in the Raleigh North Carolina

newspaper, which said they thought this was kind of a bad idea. 

That¹s also the last reference to it in the U.S. press, meaning the

only reference.  It¹s not that editors don¹t know about this.   Of

course they know about it.  In fact, it has been explicitly brought to

the attention of editors of leading newspapers, as if they didn¹t know

already.  And it¹s not that it¹s unimportant, because it is obviously

very important.  It¹s just the kind of news that¹s not fit to print. 

And that¹s very typical, not only in this part of the world, but

everywhere.  It¹s extremely important that the public be kept in the

dark about what¹s being done, because if they know about it, they¹re

not going to like it.  And if they don¹t like it, they might do

something about it.  So, there¹s a grave responsibility on the media,

and on intellectuals generally, the educational system and so on, to

ensure that people are kept in the dark about things that it¹s better

for them not to know, like this for example.  And the task is carried

out with very impressive dedication.  This is not an untypical

example.

<p>
On October 19th, Amnesty International published a report condemning

the United States for providing new military helicopters to Israel. 

They were also reporting the atrocities.  That was not reported in the

United States. It was elsewhere.  

<p>
On November 10th, Amnesty International published a much broader

condemnation of the excessive use of force and terror, and so on, that

was barely mentioned.  So it continues.
<p>

Well, let¹s turn to the question what can we do?  The answer is we

have choices.  We can do a lot.  So, for example, we can continue to

provide helicopter gunships and other military support to ensure that

Israel is able to attack civilians, maintain a blockade, starve them

to death, and so on. And we can provide the funding that allows Israel

to continue to integrate the occupied territories within Israel proper

as it has been doing, settlements, infrastructure, etc.  It doesn¹t

matter which government is in office.  It goes on under Barak about

the same way it did under Netanyahu. And it¹s anticipated to go on

next year.  The budget provisions have already been made for next

year.  So we can continue with that if we¹d like.  Or, we can act to

stop their participation in these activities, which is pretty

straightforward.  It doesn¹t require bombing or sanctions.  It just

means stop participating in atrocities, the easiest thing to do. 

That¹s a choice. And, in fact, we may even go further and call them

off, as is pretty easily done when a country has the power that the

United States has.  I gave a couple of examples.

<p>
Well, if we decide on the latter choice, which is always open here and

elsewhere, there¹s a prerequisite.  The prerequisite is that we know

what¹s going on.  So you can¹t make that choice, say to stop providing

military helicopters (and you know the helicopters are just an

illustration of a much bigger picture)  unless you know about it. 

Again, the grave responsibility of the intellectual world, the media,

journals, universities, and others, is to prevent people from knowing.

 That takes effort.  It¹s not easy.  As in this case, it takes some

dedication to suppress the facts and make sure that the population

doesn¹t know what¹s being done in their name, because if they do, they

aren¹t going to like it, and they¹ll respond.  Then you get into

trouble.  

<p>
Well, the very same applies to the diplomatic record.  Let me turn to

that. Let¹s begin with the current phase of diplomacy, what started in

September 1993, that¹s the famous Oslo process.  In September 1993,

there was a meeting on the White House lawn, very august, with the

Boston Globe having a headline describing it as ³a day of awe².  The

Israelis and the Palestinians agreed, under Clinton¹s supervision, to

what¹s called a Declaration of Principles.  There were at that time a

number of issues, and it¹s crucial to understand how the Declaration

of Principles dealt with them.

<p>
Okay, so one issue, was territory - what¹s going to happen with the

occupied territories, how they are going to be assigned ­ that¹s issue

number one.

<p>
Number two, is the issue of national rights.  Now that issue only

arises for Palestinians.  There is no question in the case of Israel,

that¹s just not in question and hasn¹t been in question at all.  The

only question is what about the rights of the Palestinians?

<p>
The third question is what about the right to resist?  And do the

Palestinians, or the Lebanese for that matter, have the right to

resist military occupation.  That¹s the third question.
<p>

The fourth question, which is kind of a counterpart to that, is

whether the occupying power (does Israel, which means the U.S. here)

have the right to attack in the occupied territories and in Lebanon? 

Those are the four main questions.  

<p>
There were answers in the Declaration of Principles.  With regard to

territory, the Declaration of Principles stated that the permanent

settlement would be on the basis of UN 242, but that raises a

question. What does UN 242 mean?  Here, we have to go to the earlier

diplomatic record.  I¹ll return to it in a moment.
<p>

The second, with regard to national rights, again, is settled in terms

of UN 242.  And anyone who is paying attention in September 1993 could

see exactly where this was going.  The Declaration of Principles

states that the permanent settlement, long term outcome, you know, the

end of the road, will be based upon UN 242 alone.  Now for 20 years,

the issue in international diplomacy had been the rejectionism of UN

242.  Remember, UN 242 says nothing about the Palestinians.   For 20

years there have been a series of efforts by the whole world to

supplement UN 242 to include Palestinian rights alongside the rights

of Israel, which were never in question.  That was the issue from the

mid-70¹s right up until Oslo, and the U.S. won flat out on that one. 

Palestinian rights are not to be considered.  It¹s just UN 242, no

Palestinian rights.  They are not mentioned and that¹s the permanent

settlement.  So, territories, it¹s UN 242, which means what the U.S.

decides (I¹ll come back to that), national rights ­ U.S. wins flat

out, the rest of the world capitulates.  What about the right to

resist?

<p>
Well, Arafat agreed at the signing of the Declaration of Principles to

abandon any right to resist, and it¹s taken for granted that in

Lebanon the population also has no right to resist.  It¹s called

terrorism if they resist.  Why did Arafat have to state this?  He

actually said it over and over again.  You know, he made solemn

pronouncements to that effect over and over, but the purpose here was

just pure humiliation.  You have to make sure you humiliate the lower

breeds to make sure that they don¹t get too big for their britches. 

George Schultz, Secretary of State, who is considered something of a

dove, put it pretty plainly.  He said it¹s true that Arafat has said

unc, unc, unc, and he said oh, oh, oh, but he hasn¹t said uncle,

uncle, uncle in a sufficiently submissive tone, and we ought to make

sure that he does, over and over again.  That¹s the way you treat the

lower breeds.  So, once again, Arafat had to say uncle, loudly and

submissively, and thank you Massa, and sign a statement saying, you

know, once again, we reject the right to resist.  Same in Lebanon, it

isn¹t even a question.

<p>
What about the fourth question, the right to attack?  A counterpart is

Israel¹s right to attack.  Well, they¹ve retained that right, and

Israel continues to use it repeatedly with U.S. support before and

after.  Notice that over this period there is virtually no defensive

pretext, contrary to what you read in U.S. commentary.  That goes way

back.  But, contrary to propaganda, almost the entire series of

U.S./Israeli attacks, certainly in the occupied territories, but in

Lebanon as well, were not for any defensive purpose.  They were

initiated.  That includes the 1982 invasion, and that¹s no small

matter.  I mean, it¹s not considered a big deal here, but during the

22 years that Israel illegally occupied Southern Lebanon in violation

of Security Council orders (but with U.S. authorization), they killed

about maybe 45,000 or 50,000 Lebanese and Palestinians, not a trivial

number. This included many very brutal attacks going on after the Oslo

accords as well, in 1983, 1986, and so on.

<p>
Incidentally, you might again want to compare this with Serbia and

Kosovo. The comparison in this case has to be kind of like a thought

experiment, because it never happened.  But, imagine if Serbia had

been bombing Albania to the extent that Israel was bombing Lebanon,

that would be an analogy.  It didn¹t happen, but you can just imagine

what the reaction would have been. It tells you again something about

our values and of the need to maintain discipline on these issues, so

that people don¹t think it through.
<p>

Well, the PLO accepted all this, just abjectly.  Israel in return and

the Declaration of Principles committed itself to absolutely nothing. 

You should take a look back at what happened on the White House lawn,

on ³the day of awe².  Prime Minister Rabin made a very terse comment,

a couple of lines, in which, after Arafat agreed to all of this stuff,

he said that Israel would now recognize the PLO as the representative

of the Palestinians ­ period.  Nothing about national rights. 

Nothing.  We just recognize you as the representative of the

Palestinians, and his Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, considered a

dove, explained why right away in Israel, in Hebrew.  He said, well,

yeah, we can recognize them now because they¹ve capitulated, so there

is no problem in recognizing them.  They can now become a kind of

junior partner in controlling the Palestinian population, which

follows a traditional colonial pattern.

<p>
Israel and the United States had made a rather serious error in the

occupied territories.  It¹s not a good idea to try to control a

subject population with your own troops.  The way it is usually done

is, you farm it out to the natives.  That¹s the way the British ran

India for a couple of hundred years.  India was mostly controlled by

Indian troops, often taken from other regions, you know like the

Gurkhas and so on.  That¹s the way the United States runs Central

America, with mercenary forces, which are called armies, if you can

keep them under control.  That¹s the way South Africa ran the Black

areas.  Most of the atrocities are carried out by Black mercenaries,

and in the Bantustans, it was entirely Blacks.  That¹s the standard

colonial pattern and it makes a lot of sense.  If you have your own

troops out there, it causes all kinds of problems.  You know, first of

all they suffer injuries, and these are people who don¹t like to feel

good about killing people, and their parents get upset and so on and

so forth, but if you have mercenaries or paramilitaries, you don¹t

have those problems.  So, Israel and the United States were going to

turn to the standard colonial pattern and have the Palestinian forces,

who in fact mostly came from Tunis, control the local population ­

control them economically and politically, as well as militarily. 

That was the idea, a sensible reversion to standard colonial practice.

 

<p>

Well, let¹s move a little back to the earlier diplomatic record, which

helps put all of this in context.  So, what about the right to resist?

 The right to resist military occupation in the territories, and in

Lebanon?  That actually has been discussed in the international

community, though you wouldn¹t know it here.  In December 1987, which

was right at the peak of all of the furor about international

terrorism, you know, the plague of the modern world, and so on and so

forth, the UN General Assembly considered and passed a resolution

condemning terrorism very strongly, you know, international terrorism

is the worst crime there is, and had all of the right wording in it

and so on and so forth.  The resolution was passed 153 to 2, which is

actually pretty normal.  The two were the usual ones, the United

States and Israel.  One country only abstained, Honduras, for unknown

reasons, so it was essentially unanimous except for the United States

and Israel.  Now, why would the United States and Israel reject, and

that means veto since it¹s a U.S. vote against, a resolution

denouncing terrorism? Well, the reason is because it contained one

paragraph which said that nothing in this resolution prejudices the

right of people to struggle against racist and colonialist regimes and

foreign military occupation and to gain the support of others for

their struggle for freedom under these conditions.  Well that, the

U.S. won¹t accept of course.  For example, that would have given the

A.N.C. in South Africa the right to resist the South African regime,

which is unacceptable.  It would have given the Lebanese the right to

resist Israeli military occupation and attacks which can¹t be

accepted, and it would have extended to the occupied territories as

well. So, therefore, the U.S. and Israel rejected it, and in fact, as

usual, it is vetoed from history.  It was never reported here, it was

never mentioned, it might as well not exist unless you read this in

the literature.  It¹s there, I mean if you go to the UN¹s dusty

records you can find it.   But that¹s the right to resist, which was

blocked by the United States in 1987 and is out of history.  

<p>
What about the right to attack?  Well, that exists by U.S. fiat, as I

mentioned during the 22 years of Israeli occupation of Southern

Lebanon. With U.S. authorization, they killed tens of thousands of

people, probably 40,000 to 50,000, and there are plenty of atrocities,

terrorist iron fist operations in 1985 for example.  But, it¹s not

only there.  The right extends much further.  So 1985 and 1986 are

interesting years.  That was the peak of the hysteria about

international terrorism, you know, the top story and so on and so

forth.  And, in fact, there was plenty of international terrorism in

those years.  For example, in 1985 Israel bombed Tunis, killing 75

people, Tunisians and Palestinians, no pretext.  The United States

publicly backed it, although Schultz, then Secretary of State, backed

off when the Security Council condemned it unanimously as an act of

armed aggression, namely a war crime, with the U.S. abstaining.  The

U.S. was directly involved.  The 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean sort

of pulled back so that the Israeli planes would be able to refuel with

the 6th Fleet pretending not to notice them, and the United States did

not warn Tunisia, an ally, that this bombing attack was coming.  So

that¹s a major act of terrorism outside the local area of the Middle

East, and there are many others.  In fact, the main act of terrorism

in that year, sort of garden variety terrorism, was a car bombing in

Beirut which killed 80 people and wounded about 200, set off by the

C.I.A., British Intelligence, and Saudi Intelligence, in an effort to

kill a Muslim cleric who they missed, but they got a lot of their

people.  It was a car bombing right outside a mosque, timed to go off

right when everybody would be coming out, so you get maximum killing

of civilians.  That¹s there, but also not in the annals of terrorism,

anymore than the bombing of Tunis, or for example, the U.S. bombing of

Libya the next year, which is another act of armed aggression, but

considered okay.

<p>
I should say that Arab opinion in the Middle East, and here too, is

very misled about all this in my opinion, pretty clearly in fact.  It

very consistently, if you read it now or in the past, claims that the

United States overlooks Israeli terrorism because of the Jewish

influence or Jewish lobby, or something like that.  And this is simply

untrue.  It¹s missing the fact that a much more general principle

applies to this case and to many others.  The principle is that the

United States has the right of terrorism and that right is inherited

by its clients, and it doesn¹t matter who they are.  So, Israel

happens to be a U.S. client, so it inherits the right of terror.  

<p>
And you can see this very easily in other parts of the world.  Just to

give one illustration from a different part of the world at the same

time, 1987, the State Department conceded what anyone paying attention

knew, that the U.S. terrorist forces attacking Nicaragua were being

directed, commanded, and trained to attack what were called ³soft²

targets, meaning defenseless civilian targets, like agricultural

cooperatives and health centers and so on.  And they were able to do

this because the U.S. had total control of the air, and surveillance,

and was able to communicate the position of the Nicaraguan army forces

to the local terrorist forces attacking from Honduras, that they could

go somewhere else, and so on.  That was all conceded publicly, but

nobody paid much attention except those who are interested in these

things.  But the human rights groups did protest. Americas Watch

protested against this, and said this was really awful.

<p>
And there was a response, an interesting response that you should

read, by Michael Kinsley, who was a kind of representative of the

dovish left in mainstream commentary, and still is.  He had an article

in which he pointed out, speaking from the dovish left, that it¹s

perfectly true that these terrorist attacks against undefended

targets, in his words, ³caused vast civilian suffering but they may

nevertheless be sensible and legitimate², and the way we decide this

is by carrying out ³cost benefit analysis², namely, and I¹m quoting

all through this, we have to measure ³the amount of blood and misery

that we will be pouring in² and compare it with the outcome, you know,

democracy in our sense, meaning ruled by the business world with the

population crushed.  And if the cost benefit analysis comes out okay,

then it¹s right to pour in blood and misery and cause vast suffering. 

In short, aggression and terror have to meet a pragmatic criterion,

and we are the ones who decide whether it¹s met, not anybody else, and

U.S. clients inherit that right ­ and it doesn¹t have to be Israel. 

It can be anybody else.  So, it can be Arabs for example.  Saddam

Hussein is a striking case.  In 1988 remember, Saddam Hussein was

still a loyal friend and ally, and that¹s when he committed his worst

crimes, that¹s the gassing of the Kurds, and so on.  The U.S. thought

that was okay and they continued to support him.  They downplayed it,

and provided him with military equipment, sent agricultural assistance

which he badly needed.  The Kurds were in an agricultural region, so

Iraq was short of food, so the Bush Administration moved in and that

continued.  In fact, Iraq, an Arab state, was allowed to do something

that up until then only Israel had been allowed to do, mainly attack a

U.S. ship and kill sailors.  Iraq was permitted to attack the USS

Stark, the destroyer, and kill 37 crewmen with missiles, and didn¹t

even get a tap on the wrist.  That means you¹re really privileged if

you are allowed to do that.  Up until then, the only country that had

been allowed to do that was Israel in 1967 in the case of the USS

Liberty.  And remember, this is an Arab state.  That was important. 

Again, nobody pays much attention here, but in the region people paid

attention.  In particular, Iran paid attention.  This was part of what

convinced Iran to capitulate to Iraq as the U.S. wanted.  The other

major event that convinced Iran that the U.S. was really serious was

the shooting down of an Iranian airliner.  Killing 290 people by an

American warship in Iranian airspace, it wasn¹t even a problem.  

Again it¹s kind of fluffed off here, not very important, but for the

Iranians, that was important, and they understood from these acts that

the U.S. was going to go to any lengths to ensure that Saddam Hussein

won, so they capitulated, not a small point in the politics of the

region.  Here, people don¹t want to think about it, but elsewhere in

the world they do. 

<p>
So, I think the thing to be recognized is, contrary to a lot of the

Arab commentary abroad and here, Washington really is an equal

opportunity employer.  That is, it adheres pretty well to a policy of

non-discrimination in advocacy of terror and war crimes, and so on. 

Other issues are involved, not, you know, who you are.
<p>

Well, let¹s go a couple of steps back further, to 242.  Remember that

UN 242, the basic document and the permanent settlement according to

the current process, was strictly rejectionist, nothing for the

Palestinians. It was taken really seriously.  There was a threat of

war at the time, nuclear war.  It called for full peace in return for

full withdrawal.  There was a deadlock.  Israel refused full

withdrawal, the Arab states refused full peace.  That deadlock was

broken in 1971, when President Sadat of Egypt, who had just come into

office, offered to accept the official U.S. position.  So, he said,

yeah, he¹ll accept full peace with Israel in return for partial

withdrawal, didn¹t even go as far as 242, namely withdrawal from

Egyptian territory.  So, if Israel would withdraw from the Sinai,

Sadat would agree to full peace.  Didn¹t say anything about the

Palestinians, nothing about the West Bank.  Israel recognized that

officially in response as a genuine peace offer.  Rabin in his memoirs

later called it a ³famous milestone on the path to peace².

<p>
Internally in Israel it was understood that they could have peace at

this point, general peace.  One of the leading Labor Party officials,

a retired general, Haim Bar-Lev, wrote in a Labor Party journal at the

time, that¹s okay, with this offer we can have full peace.  The

conflict¹s over, if we decide it¹s over, but I think we should refuse,

because if we hold out, we can get more.  This would require us to

withdraw from the Sinai, and I don¹t think we have to.  So therefore,

we should hold out and abandon peace, and that¹s what Israel did.  Its

response was that it would not withdraw to the pre-June borders.  

<p>
Well, the U.S. was then in a dilemma.  Should it continue with its

official policy, the policy which in fact it had initiated, UN 242, or

should it abandon it, and that means siding with Sadat-Egypt against

Israel, or should it abandon its policy and side with Israel against

Egypt, but that means rescinding UN 242 in effect?  And there was an

internal conflict.  The State Department was in favor of keeping to

this policy.  Kissinger, National Security Advisor, wanted what he

called stalemate, meaning no diplomacy, no negotiations, just force. 

And in the internal conflict, Kissinger won out. The U.S. effectively

rescinded UN 242, which no longer exists and people should understand

that.

<p>
UN 242 now means what the United States says it means, as do other

things, that¹s the meaning of power.  It means withdrawal, insofar as

the U.S. and Israel determine, and that¹s what it¹s meant ever since. 

So when Palestinians or Arab states now complain that Israel isn¹t

living up to 242, they are just choosing to ignore the historical

record and blindness is not a helpful position if you are in world

affairs.  You might as well have your eyes open.  UN 242 since

February 1971 does not exist.  It exists only in the Kissingerian

sense.  Now, here you have to be a little nuanced, because officially

the U.S. continues to endorse UN 242 in its original sense.  So you

can find statements by Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, or you know

speechwriters, and George Bush, saying yeah, we insist on 242 in its

original sense.  You can¹t find statements by Clinton.  Clinton, I

think, is the first president not even having given lip service to it.

 But the fact is that the lip service is pure hypocrisy, because while

they are adhering to it for public purposes, they are also providing

Israel with the wherewithal, the funds, the military support, the

diplomatic support, to violate it, namely to act to integrate the

occupied territories within Israel, so the endorsement of it is

hypocritical and you should compliment Clinton on having the honesty

simply to withdraw it, in effect.
<p>

Well, that brings us up to February 1971.  The United States has also

blocked all other UN resolutions, except for one, UN resolution 194,

December 11, 1948, which called for the right of return of refugees,

or a compensation.  That was technically endorsed by the United

States, like they voted for it at the UN every year, but pure

hypocrisy.  And again Clinton overcame the hypocrisy.  He withdrew

support for it.  So the last vote was unanimous with Israel and the

United States opposed, and the Clinton Administration also declared

all other related UN resolutions null and void. It will now only be

the Oslo process, so that¹s honesty again.

<p>
Sadat in 1971 made it very clear, and continued for several years, to

make it clear that if the United States refused to accept a negotiated

settlement, he would be forced to go to war.  Nobody took him

seriously.  A lot of racism here, it was assumed that Arabs didn¹t

know which end of the gun to hold and that sort of thing.  Finally war

came in 1973, and it turned out to be a very close thing, and it

scared everyone.  There was another near nuclear confrontation and

Israel was in deep trouble for awhile.  And it was understood that

Egypt can¹t just be written off.  They¹re not just a basket case.  So,

Kissinger moved to the natural fall back position, namely exclude

Egypt from the conflict.  It¹s the only Arab deterrent, so we can¹t

just ignore it, so exclude it from the conflict, then you get shuttle

diplomacy.  In 1977, comes Sadat¹s famous trip to Jerusalem, where he

was hailed as a kind of a saint for being the first Arab leader to be

willing to talk to Israel.  In fact, in Jerusalem, if you look at his

speech, it was less forthcoming than his offer in February 1971.  In

February 1971, he offered full peace, with nothing about the

Palestinians.  In his trip to Jerusalem, he insisted on rights for the

Palestinians.  But that¹s allowed to enter history.  February 1971 is

out of history.  I mean you can¹t even find it in the scholarly

literature.  But, the trip to Jerusalem is in history because at that

time the U.S. was compelled to accept the offer, whereas in February

of 1971 it was able to reject the offer.  So one is out of history,

the other is in history.  Sadat is a secular saint because of his trip

in 1977, not because of his more forthcoming offer in February 1971.  

<p>
Well, that goes on to Camp David in 1978 and 1979, under Carter, and

it¹s considered a grand moment of the peace process.  Israel did agree

to withdraw from Sinai as Egypt had offered seven years earlier, and

the U.S. at this point had no choice but to agree.  The result,

however, was understood very clearly in Israel.  One leading Israeli

military strategic analyst, Avner Yaniv, pointed out right away that

the Camp David settlement eliminates the only Arab deterrent and

therefore allows Israel to continue at will to integrate the occupied

territories into Israel and to attack its northern neighbor, to attack

Lebanon, with massive U.S. support in both cases.  The Carter

Administration rapidly increased support to more than half of the

total U.S. aid overseas, to make sure that these ends could be

achieved.  

<p>
Well, while all this was going on, there was another current.  The

international consensus on the issue had shifted.  In 1967, there was

nothing for the Palestinians, no Palestinian rights.  By the early

70¹s that was changing.  By the mid-70¹s there was an extremely broad

international consensus, including just about everybody, calling for

Palestinian national rights, alongside of Israel.  It included the

Russians, it included Europe, it included Asia, Latin America,

virtually everyone.

<p>
That came to a head in January 1976, another very important event,

crucial for understanding what¹s happening now, but out of history,

because it tells the wrong story.  You can find it, but you know, it¹s

out of history, again even out of scholarship.  In January 1976, the

United Nations Security Council considered a resolution calling for a

two state settlement.  It included all the wording of UN 242, so

everything about Israel¹s rights and so on, but it added national

rights for the Palestinians in the territories that had been occupied,

from which Israel was to withdraw according to the original

understanding of 242.  Well, what happened to that?  Well that

resolution was actually brought by what are called the confrontation

states, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan.  It was strongly supported by the

PLO, though they may have forgotten that.  In fact, I suspect they

have.  But in fact according to Israel¹s UN representative, Chaim

Herzog (later President), the resolution was actually prepared by the

PLO.  I don¹t think that¹s likely, but that¹s what Israel perceives at

least.  Anyhow, it was certainly supported by them, and by the

confrontation states, and indeed, by virtually the entire world. 

Maybe Khaddafi didn¹t support it, I don¹t remember, but essentially

the whole world supported it.
<p>

And Israel and the United States had to react.  Israel reacted in a

typical way, by bombing Lebanon.  It bombed Lebanon, killing 50 people

in some village that was chosen at random.  That was reported here,

but considered insignificant.  It was retaliation against the United

Nations, in effect. The United States reacted in a simpler way, namely

by vetoing the resolution, so it was vetoed by Carter, and that means

vetoed from history. Remember, it¹s very common for the U.S. to veto

Security Council resolutions.  In fact, it¹s the champion of the world

by a long shot.  But they disappeared from history as well.  Carter

did the same thing in 1980, same resolution.  But, meanwhile, the

international consensus persisted.

<p>
Here you can begin to understand the significance of the fact that the

Declaration of Principles in September of 1993 referred to UN 242 and

nothing else.  Because by then, there is a whole raft of resolutions

vetoed by the U.S. at the Security Council, but passed at the General

Assembly, calling for Palestinian national rights, and they were not

to be part of the permanent settlement under the U.S. version of the

peace process.  The General Assembly had votes year after year, I

won¹t run through the details, but their wording varied a little bit,

but they were more or less the same, you know, kind of a two state

settlement, national rights for both groups. The votes were 150 to 2,

or something like that.  Occasionally the U.S. would pick up another

vote, from El Salvador, or somebody, but that was year by year,

essentially never reported.  They will, in fact, probably never report

it.  

<p>
The last vote was December 1990, 144 to 2, and the date is important.

Shortly after that, a couple of weeks after, the United States and

Britain bombed Iraq.  Saddam, remember, had shifted from loyal friend

and ally to reincarnation of Hitler, not because of any crimes, the

crimes were fine, but because he had disobeyed orders, or maybe

misunderstood orders, and that¹s not permitted, so that¹s a standard

transition, and therefore, you had to get rid of the beast of Baghdad,

and you know, it¹s obvious where the power was, so that worked. 

During the bombing, George Bush announced, probably the coming of the

New World Order.  He defined it very simply. What we say goes, said it

sort of clearly, certainly with regard to the Middle East.  The rest

of the world understood that.  Everybody backed off. Europe

disappeared, the Third World was in disarray, Russia was gone.

<p>
At this point, the U.S. could simply ram through its own extreme

rejectionist position, and it did.  The Madrid conference took place a

few months later, and then you go straight on to Oslo.  Then come

successive agreements and the integration of the territories continues

right through the Oslo period.  The various agreements - it¹s late so

I won¹t run through them, authorize this, the U.S. funds it, it

protects it diplomatically, which brings us up to Camp David and the

year 2000.

<p>
Regarding the public discussion about Barak¹s remarkable offers and,

you know, forthcoming this and that, and willing to give away

everything - there is absolutely no basis for any of that.

<p>
There was a focus on Jerusalem, and for good reasons.  Jerusalem is

probably the easiest of all of the problems to solve, and for Clinton

and Barak it made good sense to focus on Jerusalem because then you

would divert attention away from what¹s important, namely what¹s going

on in the occupied territories, the settlement, the infrastructure

development, the enclaves, and so on.  For Arafat it also made good

sense to focus on Jerusalem because he is desperately eager to get

support from the Arab states, and the Arab states don¹t give a damn

what happens to the Palestinians.  Their populations may, but

certainly not the leaders.  On the other hand, they will find it

difficult to abandon control over the religious sites, because if they

do that, their populations will blow up.  So, by focusing on the

religious sites, it¹s kind of a negotiating ploy for Arafat, so they

all focused on that, neglecting the crucial problem, what¹s gone on

elsewhere.

<p>
I have a couple of Israeli maps with me.  These are final status maps,

you know, what it¹s supposed to look like in the long term.  And what

it looks like in the long term, briefly, is what¹s called Jerusalem

extends all the way to the Jordan river, so that splits the West Bank

in two, with a substantial city, Ma¹ale Adumim in the middle and

extension all the way. There is another break in the North right

through Samaria, includes towns that are settled there.  Israel keeps

the Jordan river.  Jericho is isolated.  You end up with four

Palestinian camptowns, separated from one another, separated from

Jerusalem, but there¹s some hint that in the long term, some

meaningless connection will be established between them, but they are

essentially completely controlled and surrounded.  What¹s called

Jerusalem extends north of Ramallah, and south of Bethlehem.  If you

look at the map, that¹s the area which splits the northern and central

and southern settlement areas.  It¹s kind of modeled on South Africa¹s

policies in the early 60¹s.  The population concentrations should be

under local administration, but everything else is taken over by the

dominant power, the resources, the useable land, and so on.  And there

is massive infrastructure developments that sort of lie behind this.

<p>
The U.S. is paying for all of it, of course.  That¹s the marvelous

offer that was given.  And apart from what¹s talked about, what

actually counts, of course, is what¹s happening on the ground.  And

what¹s happening on the ground has been implementing this.  Finally

you can¹t spend half a day driving through the West Bank without

seeing it.  It¹s a little harder to drive through Gaza, because it¹s

usually closed off, but essentially the same thing is happening there.

<p>
And the situation is extremely serious.  Right through the occupation

from 1967 to 1993, Israel was making sure, and again, when I say

Israel, I mean the United States, was making sure that there would be

no development in the occupied territories.  So, right after 1993,

when Israeli journalists who had covered the territories were finally

able to go to Jordan, they were shocked by what they saw and they

wrote about it in the Hebrew press. Jordan is a poor country, and

Israel is a rich country.  Before the 1967 war, the populations in

Jordan and the Palestinian populations were pretty comparable, in

fact, there was more development in the West Bank.  By 1993, it was

totally different.  In the poorer country Jordan, there were

agricultural development, universities, schools, roads, health

services, all sorts of things.  In the West Bank there was essentially

nothing.  The people could survive by remittances from abroad, or by

doing dirty work in Israel, but no development was allowed, and that

was very shocking to Israeli reporters, and it is also backed up in

the statistics.  The most important work on this topic, if you want to

learn about, is by Sara Roy, a researcher at Harvard who has spent an

awful lot of time in the Gaza Strip. Just to give you a couple of her

figures, current ones, in 1993 electric power usage in the West Bank

and Gaza was two thirds that of Egypt, half that of Jordan ­ and those

are poorer countries, remember.  Israel is a rich country.  Sanitation

and housing in the West Bank and Gaza was about 25 percent for

Palestinians, 50 percent in Egypt, and 100 percent in Jordan, and the

figures run through that way.  GDP, per capita, and consumption per

capita declined and then it got worse.  After 1993, it¹s been the

worst.  So GDP, per capita, and consumption per capita have dropped,

according to her, about 15 percent in the West Bank and Gaza since

1993 - that¹s even with large foreign assistance pouring in, from

Europe, mostly.

<p>
It¹s gotten worse in other respects.  Up until 1993, the U.S. and

Israel permitted humanitarian aid to come into the territories.  UN

humanitarian aid was permitted into the West Bank and Gaza.  In 1993,

that was restricted.  This is part of the peace process.  After Oslo,

heavy customs duties were imposed, lots of other restrictions were

imposed, you know various kinds of harassment.  Now, it¹s blocked. 

Right now, humanitarian aid is blocked.  The UN is protesting, but it

doesn¹t matter.  If the UN protests the blocking of humanitarian aid,

and it doesn¹t register here, it doesn¹t matter.  And it doesn¹t

register here because it¹s not reported. So, they can say, yeah the

Israelis are stopping humanitarian aid from coming in, and people are

starving, and so on, but what does it matter as long as people in the

United States don¹t know about it.   They can know in the Middle East,

they can know in Europe, but it makes no difference.  These are our

choices again.

<p>
For the Palestinians themselves, they are under a dual repression,

very much like the Bantustans again, the repression of Israel and the

United States, and then the repression of the local mercenaries who do

the work for the foreigner, and enrich themselves.  It¹s again a

standard, colonial pattern. Anyone who has ever taken a look at the

Third World sees it.

<p>
As for the goals of Oslo, they were stated very nice and neatly by one

of the leading Israeli doves, who is now the Minister of Security in

the Barak government, and a temporary foreign minister, known as an

academic dove, Shlomo Ben-Ami.  In an academic book, 1998, so before

he got into the government, he described the goals of Oslo as to

impose what he called a permanent neo-colonialist dependency in the

West Bank and Gaza.  And that¹s pretty much accurate, that¹s what the

U.S. has been aiming for through the peace process - period.


<p>As for the population, it¹s kind of hard to improve on a description

by Moshe Dayan about 30 years ago.  He was in the Labor Party, and

among the Labor Party leaders, he was one of those most noted for his

sympathetic attitude towards Palestinians, and also his realism.  And

he described what Israeli policy ought to be, U.S. policy as well.  He

said the Palestinians should live like dogs and whoever wishes may

leave, and we¹ll see where this leads.  Reasonable policy, and that¹s

U.S. policy as well, and it will continue that way as long as we agree

to permit it.
