<h3>The legacy of Ariel Sharon</h3>
<p>  By Robert Fisk 
<p>11 February 2001

This is a place of filth and blood which will forever be associated
with Ariel Sharon. In Israel today, he may well be elected prime
minister. Then he will be master of the most powerful nation in the
Middle East; he will travel to America, he will visit the White House
and shake hands with President George W Bush. But for everyone who
stood in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in Beirut on 18 September
1982, his name is synonymous with butchery; with bloated corpses and
disembowelled women and dead babies, with rape and pillage and
murder... 
<p>
Even when I walk these fetid streets today, more than 18 years after
what was – by Israel's own definition of that much-misused phrase –
the worst single act of terrorism in modern Middle East history, the
ghosts haunt me still. Over there, on the side of the road leading to
the Sabra mosque, lay Mr Nouri, 90 years old, grey-bearded, in pyjamas
with a small woollen hat still on his head and a stick by his side. I
found him on a pile of garbage, on his back, fly-encrusted eyes
staring at the blazing sun. Just up the lane, I came across two women
sitting upright with their brains blown out, next to a cooking pot and
a dead horse. One of the women appeared to have had her stomach slit
open. A few metres away, I discovered the first babies, already black
with decomposition, scattered across the road like rubbish. 
<p>
Yes, those of us who got into Sabra and Chatila before the murderers
left have our memories. The flies racing between the reeking bodies
and our faces, between dried blood and reporter's notebook, the hands
of watches still ticking on dead wrists. I clambered up a rampart of
earth – an abandoned bulldozer stood guiltily nearby – only to find,
once I was atop the mound, that it swayed beneath me. And I looked
down to find faces, elbows, mouths, a woman's legs protruding through
the soil. I had to hold on to these body parts to climb down the other
side. Then there was the pretty girl, her head surrounded by a halo of
clothes pegs, her blood still running from a hole in her back. We had
burst into the yard of her home, desperate to avoid the Israeli-
uniformed militiamen who still roamed the camp; coming in by back
door, we had found her body as the murderers left by the front door. 
<p>
And as I walked through the carnage on 18 September – the last day of
the three-day massacre – with Loren Jenkins of The Washington Post, a
fierce, tough, Colorado reporter, I remember how he stopped in shock
and disgust. And then, with as much energy as his lungs could summon
in the sweet, foul air, he shouted, "SHARON!" so loudly that the name
echoed off the crumpled walls above the bodies. "He's responsible for
this fucking mess," Jenkins roared. And that, just over four months
later – in more diplomatic words and in a report in which the
murderers were called "soldiers" – was what the Israeli commission of
enquiry decided. Sharon, who was minister of defence, bore "personal
responsibility", the Kahan commission stated, and recommended his
removal from office. Sharon resigned. 
<p>
And so today, in this fetid, awful place, where Lebanese Muslim 
militiamen were – three years later – to kill hundreds more 
Palestinians in a war which produced no official inquiries, where
scarcely 20 per cent of the survivors still live, where brown mud and
rubbish now covers the mass grave of 600 of the 1982 victims, the
Palestinians wait to see if their tormentor will hold the highest
office in the state of Israel. 
<p>
"Ariel Sharon was responsible," a well-dressed young man shouted at us
from an apartment balcony yesterday morning. And who could disagree?
Israel had invaded Lebanon on 6 June 1982 with a plan – known to
Sharon but not vouchsafed to his Likud prime minister, Menachem Begin
– to advance all the way to Beirut and surround Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organisation guerrillas in the Lebanese capital.
Officially named "Operation Peace for Galilee" (the real Israeli
military codename was "Snowball"), the invasion was supposedly a
response to PLO rocket attacks across the Israeli border. 
<p>
But the rocket attacks had followed a series of Israeli air-raids on
Lebanon which had ended a UN-brokered ceasefire and which were
supposedly in "retaliation" for the attempted murder of the Israeli
ambassador to London – though his would-be killers came from the Abu
Nidal group which had nothing to do with the PLO and hated Arafat. But
Sharon had anyway received an earlier American "green light" for his
operation from Alexander Haig in the spring of 1982. After two months
and almost 17,000 deaths, most of them civilians – the majority killed
by Israeli gunfire and air attack – the PLO withdrew from Beirut under
international protection, leaving their unarmed families behind. At
which point Sharon announced that 2,000 "terrorists" remained in the
Sabra and Chatila camps. These mythical "terrorists" prompted a small
advance by Israeli tanks – contrary to an agreement with Washington –
towards the Palestinian camps. A French UN officer who tried to
photograph the advance was shot dead by an "unknown" sniper. Sharon
repeated his extraordinary claim that "terrorists" remained in the
camps. And it was then that the Christian Lebanese president-elect,
Bashir Gemayel – the leader of the Phalange militia which had already
murdered thousands of surrendering Palestinians in the Tel el-Zaatar
camp in 1976 – was assassinated. 
<p>
Sharon paid his condolences to Gemayel's father, Pierre. He must have
known the old man's history. Pierre Gemayel had founded his party
after being inspired by the Olympics in Nazi Germany in 1936 ("I liked
their idea of order," he once confided to me). Not for nothing did
Israel's militia allies use the fascist "Phalange" as their name. As
the Christians prepared to bury their hero, Sharon – again contrary to
assurances he had given the Americans – ordered the Israeli army into
west Beirut to "restore order". The Israelis then asked the Christian
Phalange – armed and uniformed by Israel and allied to Israel since
1976 – to enter the Israeli-surrounded camps to "liquidate" the
"terrorists". Which is why, on Thursday 16 September, guided by
signposts which the Israelis had laid across a Beirut airport runway,
the Christian gunmen walked through the southern entrance of Chatila,
some of them drunk, a number on drugs – all under the eyes of the
Israelis – and embarked on a war crime. 
<p>
Today, much scarred by later wars, the lanes of Chatila still follow
the same paths I walked down 18 years ago. There are always survivors
who have never told their stories to us before. Yesterday I wandered
up an alleyway – rippling with water pipes and running with rain and
sewage – to find a middle-aged woman buying tomatoes from a stall. I
was 30 metres from the road where I discovered Mr Nouri's body almost
two decades ago. She took me to her family home and introduced me to
her daughter, Nadia Salameh. Nadia was only 12 when Ariel Sharon's
soldiers watched the Phalangist militia slaughter their way through
the camps. 
<p>
"At the end of this alleyway outside our home, we were all shocked by
what we saw," she told me, her voice slowly rising with the memory of
horror. "I saw corpses there, seven deep, some decapitated, others
with their throats slit. One of our neighbours was lying there, Um
Ahmed Saad, and her body had grown big with the heat. Her hands had
been chopped off at the wrists. She used to wear a lot of bracelets, a
lot of gold. The Phalange obviously wanted the gold." 
<p>
Each house I enter contains the faded photographs of young men killed
in the war, some by Israel's allies, others by Shia Muslim gunmen in
the later 1985 camps war. But their memories have not faded. Old
Abdullah – he is 78 and pleaded with us not to use his family name –
talks without looking at me, eyes staring at the wall. The ghosts are
returning again. "The Phalange were led by Elie Hobeika," he said,
"but who sent them into the camps? The Israelis. And who was the
defence minister? Sharon. They put their tanks round the camp. I was
part of a delegation that tried to negotiate with them. We carried a
white flag. When we got near, there was a man's voice on a loudspeaker
telling us to have our identity cards ready. But I didn't have my ID.
So I went back home. And it turned out the loudspeaker was being used
by a Phalangist. And they murdered all the men in the delegation. I
was the only one to survive." 
<p>
There was no doubt that the Israelis could see what the Lebanese
Christian Phalange were doing. The Kahan commission was later to quote
Lieutenant Avi Grabovski, deputy commander of an Israeli tank unit
that was helping to encircle the camp: he watched the murder of five
women and children and wanted to protest, but his battalion commander
had replied to another soldier who complained that "we know, it's not
to our liking, and don't interfere". Up to 2,000 Palestinians were
murdered – two mass graves remain unexhumed in Beirut – and Sharon's
reputation, already besmirched by the much earlier slaughter of more
than 50 Palestinian civilians by his Commando Unit 101, seemed as
buried as the Palestinian victims. 
<p>
But like the garbage that has collected over the only known mass
grave, the historical narrative – save for that of the survivors – has
become overgrown. History moves on. Arafat recognised Israel and found
himself trapped by an agreement that would give him neither a real
"Palestine" nor secure the return of the refugees – including those in
Sabra and Chatila – to what is now Israel. And the new leader of
Israel is, within hours, likely to be the man who allowed the killers
into the Beirut camps more than 18 years ago. 
<p>
With power, of course, comes respect. CNN now calls Sharon "a barrel-
framed veteran general who has built a reputation for flattening
obstacles and reshaping Israel's landscape", while the BBC World
Service on Sunday managed to avoid the fateful words Sabra and Chatila
by referring only to his "chequered military career". As for Nadia
Salameh, "Sharon's role here shows what he is capable of. If Sharon is
elected, the whole peace process falls by the wayside because he
doesn't want peace." It's a relief to recall that up to a million
Israelis demonstrated their moral integrity in 1982 by protesting in
Tel Aviv against the massacre. And equally chilling to reflect that
some of those one million – if the polls are accurate – may well be
voting for Mr Sharon today.
