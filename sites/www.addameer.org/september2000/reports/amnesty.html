<p><b> ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: MASS ARRESTS AND POLICE BRUTALITY</b></p>
<p>Published 10 November, 2000</p>
<p> <b>INTRODUCTION</b> 
<p>Since 29 September 2000, hundreds of people, most of them Palestinians, have 
  been arrested in Israel and in East Jerusalem in connection with demonstrations 
  and disturbances. The arrests still continue. Over 400 people, including at 
  least 30 children, were believed to be held in detention on 30 October; the 
  courts have refused bail to many detainees, in particular Palestinians. 
<p>Amnesty International is extremely concerned by reports that some detainees, 
  including children, were beaten or otherwise ill-treated during arrest and sometimes 
  in detention. Ill-treatment of detainees appears to be widespread by the Israel 
  Police and the Border Police and to be fostered by a culture of impunity. Amnesty 
  International is also concerned by reports that at least 10 Palestinians have 
  been denied access to lawyers for periods of up to one week, in breach of international 
  human rights standards. 
<p>Since 29 September more than 170 people, the vast majority of them Palestinians, 
  have been killed in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Most were killed by 
  Israeli security forces. In addition, Jews have been attacked and killed by 
  Palestinians and Palestinians have been attacked and killed by Jews. In response 
  to concern at repeated reports of Israeli security forces using excessive lethal 
  force in the policing of demonstrations by Palestinians, Amnesty International 
  sent a delegation to Israel and the Occupied Territories on 4 October to investigate 
  the use of force by Israeli security forces in the light of international standards 
  on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials. On 19 October 
  2000 Amnesty International issued a report Israel and the Occupied Territories: 
  Excessive use of lethal force (MDE 15/41/00); the report examines killings of 
  Palestinians caused by the excessive use of force by Israeli security forces.1 
  On 21 October Amnesty International sent a second delegation to the area; one 
  area of its work was to gather information about arrests and detentions which 
  had occurred since 29 September. This report focuses on arrests and detentions 
  within Israel and East Jerusalem. The Israeli army and the Border Police have 
  also carried out arrests in the rest of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip 
  since 29 September on a smaller scale and some detainees have reportedly been 
  subjected to torture or ill-treatment. 
<p><b>ARRESTS IN ISRAEL </b> 
<p><b>Background to the arrests </b> 
<p>82 per cent of Israeli citizens are Jewish and 18 per cent are Palestinians. 
  Following its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, Israel annexed 
  East Jerusalem; the Israeli government gave the Palestinians in East Jerusalem 
  permanent residency status. A small number of Palestinians who had this residency 
  status have become Israeli citizens. 
<p>On 29 September 2000 the police opened fire on Palestinians at the al-Aqsa 
  mosque compound in East Jerusalem. Four Palestinians were killed and over 200 
  injured. About 70 police officers were reportedly also injured. These events 
  were followed by clashes in the Occupied Territories resulting in the death 
  of dozens more Palestinians and injury to hundreds of others. In the days following 
  29 September Palestinian citizens of Israel, who constitute about 18 per cent 
  of Israel’s population, organized demonstrations in towns and villages all over 
  Israel to protest the behaviour of the Israeli security forces in the Occupied 
  Territories, particularly in Jerusalem. In certain locations in Israel, these 
  demonstrations developed into violent clashes between protestors and the security 
  forces. In a number of towns and villages the security forces opened fire on 
  demonstrators, using rubber bullets and even live ammunition. At least 11 Palestinian 
  citizens of Israel were killed by the security forces and hundreds of others 
  were injured, many as a result of excessive use of force. 
<p>On 7 October Palestinians attacked Joseph’s Tomb, a site which is holy to Jews 
  and Muslims, in Nablus in the Occupied Territories. Earlier that day the Israel 
  Defence Forces (IDF) had vacated the site, in which Israeli settlers had established 
  a synagogue and a Jewish religious school. Following the attack, Jews participated 
  in anti-Palestinian riots in various parts of Israel, including Nazareth, Tiberias, 
  Tel Aviv/Jaffa, Haifa, Lod, Ramleh, Ashdod and Ashkelon. 
<p>Hundreds of people have been arrested since 28 September, about two-thirds 
  of them Palestinian citizens of Israel and one-third of them Jewish citizens. 
  Most of those arrested have been accused of throwing stones, assaulting police 
  officers, damaging property or public order offences such as participating in 
  an unlawful assembly or rioting. 
<p>By 13 October the demonstrations and riots had ended, but arrests of Palestinians 
  continued in the Galilee, the Triangle and in the Negev, areas in Israel where 
  the majority of Palestinians live. Many Palestinians have been arrested in the 
  middle of the night at their homes; others have been arrested at checkpoints. 
  The Israeli Police have asked three private hospitals in Nazareth to provide 
  information on the identities of people whom they treated for injuries sustained 
  during the demonstrations. 
<p><b>Refusal of bail </b> 
<p>Prosecutors working for the Office of the State Attorney have requested in 
  many cases that the courts order that defendants, including children, arrested 
  in connection with rioting following 29 September, be detained in custody until 
  the end of criminal proceedings rather than being released on bail, in order 
  to calm the situation. The Attorney General, Elyakim Rubenstein, confirmed this 
  policy on 30 October and is reported to have stated: “We will study the situation 
  on the ground in the near future and on a routine basis. The data that we have 
  so far does not indicate that the time is ripe to change our policy.”2 He emphasized 
  that the policy also applied to Jews who had participated in riots. 
<p> International human rights standards, in particular Article 9(3) of the International 
  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, emphasize that people awaiting trial 
  should not, as a general rule, be held in custody. International standards relating 
  to the detention of children are founded on the principle that, in most cases, 
  the best interests of children are protected by not separating them from their 
  family. Article 37(b) of the Convention on the Rights of Child, to which Israel 
  is a state party, states: "Arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child should 
  only be used as a measure of last resort, must be in conformity with the law, 
  and for the shortest appropriate time." 
<p> In a series of appeal decisions from 8 October 2000 the Supreme Court has 
  repeatedly ordered detention without bail of detainees arrested in connection 
  with the events, including a Palestinian child aged 15 and a Jewish child aged 
  16. For example, on 8 October Judge Kheshin considered an appeal by the state 
  attorney’s office against the granting of bail to Muhammad Mahmoud Hamid, a 
  Nazareth resident. Muhammad Hamid had been charged with participating in an 
  unlawful assembly and rioting. The judge upheld the appeal and refused bail 
  stating: 
<p> “Youngsters in Israel, youngsters and adults, must know that a person who 
  throws stones at a police officer who comes to enforce order at the scene of 
  a riot, shows himself to be dangerous to human safety and to public safety, 
  and being dangerous, he can be expected to be detained in order to protect those 
  values of order without which we cannot maintain a proper society. Indeed, a 
  person who deliberately raises a stone against a person whom society sends to 
  enforce law and order cannot be prevented by an alternative to detention from 
  once again committing the act he committed.” 
<p>According to lawyers representing detainees, the lower courts – the magistrates 
  courts and the district courts – have tended to follow Supreme Court decisions 
  ordering that those arrested should be held in detention until the end of criminal 
  proceedings and to refuse bail without considering the individual circumstances 
  of each case, in particular whether there is any alternative to holding the 
  detainee in custody. 
<p> Despite the Attorney General’s statement that the same policy of seeking remand 
  in custody was being applied to Jews as well as to Palestinians, a far higher 
  proportion of Palestinians have been ordered detained until the end of the trial 
  than Jews. As of 30 October, according to figures provided by the Ministry of 
  Justice and the Police, about 1,000 Israeli citizens had been arrested since 
  28 September. About 66 per cent (660) were Palestinians and 34 per cent (340) 
  were Jews. Eighty-nine per cent of those detained until the end of the trial 
  were Palestinians (including Palestinians from the Occupied Territories arrested 
  in Israel) and 11 per cent were Jews. 
<p><b>Denial of access to a lawyer </b>
<p>Amnesty International has received reports that at least 10 Palestinians detained 
  in connection with the demonstrations and disturbances have been prohibited 
  any access to lawyers for periods of up to one week. Under section 35 of the 
  Criminal Procedure (Powers of Enforcement - Arrest) Law of 1996, a meeting between 
  detainees and their lawyers can be prohibited for up to 21 days from arrest. 
  Such restrictions contravene international human rights standards, including 
  Principle 7 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, which states: “Governments 
  shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, with or without 
  criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any case not later 
  than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.” Isolation of detainees 
  from the outside world appears to be a tactic used by the Israeli authorities, 
  in particular Israel’s internal security agency, the General Security Service 
  (GSS), to place psychological pressure on detainees in order to secure a confession 
  or useful information. 
<p>During a visit to Kufar Kana on 27 October Amnesty International delegates 
  learnt of four detainees, Mahmoud ‘Awawdeh, arrested on 23 October, ‘Abd al-Ra’uf 
  ‘Aqayleh, arrested on 23 October and released on 26 October, and Faruq Khalil 
  Hamza and Kamal Farid Hamdan, both arrested on 26 October, who had been prohibited 
  from meeting with their lawyers while they were being interrogated by the GSS. 
  Mahmoud ‘Awawdeh saw a lawyer for the first time on the morning of 27 October, 
  on the fifth day of detention. Faruq Khalil Hamza and Kamal Farid Hamdan saw 
  a lawyer for the first time on 30 October, the fifth day of detention. Amnesty 
  International later learnt of another Palestinian from Kufar Kana, Fares ‘Awawdeh, 
  arrested on 2 November, who was denied access to his lawyer until 7 November, 
  his sixth day of detention. 
<p><b>Police brutality </b>
<p>Amnesty International has received many reports that Israeli police and border 
  police have physically assaulted Palestinians, including children, as they were 
  being arrested and as they were being transported to police stations. It has 
  also received reports of beatings in detention. Detainees have also been beaten 
  in custody. Amnesty International delegates interviewed several persons who 
  were beaten or otherwise ill treated in custody. Israel is a state party to 
  the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
  or Punishment. The convention requires Israel to prevent acts of torture or 
  ill-treatment, to investigate allegations of such conduct and to bring to justice 
  persons suspected of perpetrating such acts. 
<p> Under Israeli law, arrested persons must be brought to court within 24 hours 
  of their arrest. Several lawyers told Amnesty International delegates that they 
  informed judges that their clients had been beaten in custody and sometimes 
  judges listened to testimony from the detainee himself. In some cases judges 
  ordered that the detainee be examined by a police doctor. Some lawyers requested 
  judges to allow the detainee to be examined by an independent doctor but their 
  requests were refused. Amnesty International is concerned that police doctors 
  are not sufficiently independent from the police to be able to carry out effective 
  investigations of allegations of torture or ill-treatment. 
<p> <b>Arrests of children </b>
<p> Israeli law and regulations provide for the special treatment of juvenile 
  offenders, i.e. children under the age of 18. Police Standing Order 14.01.05 
  sets down the following procedures: 
<p> In general children are to be brought by their parent or guardian for investigation 
  to a police station; 
<p> Questioning of children must generally be done during the day; 
<p> With certain exceptions, the questioning of a child is carried out by a specially-trained 
  police youth officer; 
<p>Children are not to be handcuffed except in extraordinary circumstances, such 
  as if the child is known to be violent, has attempted to abscond from lawful 
  custody in the past, or there are reasonable grounds to believe that the child 
  will tamper with evidence. 
<p> Reports indicate that the police have not followed their own procedures when 
  arresting and detaining Palestinian children. As a matter of routine, the police 
  have arrested children rather than inviting them for investigation to police 
  stations with their parents. Children have often been arrested late at night 
  or early in the morning and interrogated soon after they reached the police 
  station. Children have been handcuffed following arrest and during interrogation. 
  Children have been reportedly beaten by police officers. Lawyers informed Amnesty 
  International that in many cases children had been interrogated by ordinary 
  interrogators or by a combination of ordinary interrogators and a special youth 
  investigator. A great deal of psychological pressure had been placed on some 
  children – they had been shouted at, insulted and threatened during interrogation. 
  Such conduct contravenes international standards, including Principle 21 of 
  the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under any Form of Detention 
  or Imprisonment and Article 40(2)(iv) of the Convention on the Rights of the 
  Child, which prohibit taking undue advantage of the situation of detained persons 
  for the purpose of compelling them to confess, incriminate themselves or provide 
  information against other people. The police’s behaviour in such cases also 
  contravenes Article 37(c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which 
  states: "Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and 
  respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which 
  takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age..." 
<p><b>Lack of effective investigations </b> 
<p>The Department for the Investigation of Police Misconduct has responsibility 
  for investigating allegations of criminal conduct, including ill-treatment, 
  by the Israel Police and the Border Police. On 30 October, the Attorney General 
  reportedly stated that only one complaint had been lodged against the police 
  to the department and that all other investigations of police misconduct had 
  been initiated by the department itself. Lawyers interviewed by Amnesty International 
  expressed a lack of confidence in the department’s investigations, in particular 
  as it is mainly staffed by persons seconded from the police. In 1998, the Association 
  for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) noted: 
<p>“More than 80% of investigations of complaints relating to police violence 
  are closed for various reasons – an extremely high proportion. It must be asked 
  whether this phenomenon is due to spurious complaints, objective difficulties 
  in investigation lack of personnel or, perhaps, more fundamental problems in 
  the functioning of the investigators and the policy of the PID [Department for 
  the Investigation of Police Misconduct].”1 
<p>Given the fact that it is staffed mainly from persons seconded from the police, 
  the Department for the Investigation of Police Misconduct appears to lack the 
  independence and impartiality required under international human rights standards, 
  including Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention against Torture, for carrying 
  out investigations of torture or ill-treatment. In its report, ACRI also noted 
  that, in an increasing number of cases, persons who had complained to the department 
  about police brutality and whose case had been closed, had been charged with 
  assaulting police officers. 
<p>On 21 October the Israeli government ordered the establishment of an ad hoc 
  fact-finding committee to examine "clashes a number of weeks ago with security 
  forces in which Israeli citizens, Arabs and Jews, were involved". The government 
  was criticized by many Israeli non-governmental organizations and lawyers, as 
  well as Amnesty International, for not establishing a judicial commission of 
  inquiry regulated by the Law on Commissions of Inquiry of 1968; such a commission 
  has greater independence as its members are appointed by the President of the 
  Supreme Court, rather than the government, and it has powers to compel witnesses 
  to testify and to grant immunity from prosecution in relation to statements 
  given to those who testify before it. Apparently in response to public pressure, 
  on 8 November, the Israeli government replaced the fact-finding committee with 
  a commission of inquiry established under the 1968 law. According to media reports, 
  the Office of the Prime Minister announced that the commission’s mandate "was 
  to investigate the clashes with security forces...in which Jewish and Arab Israeli 
  citizens were killed and wounded." It is not clear whether the commission of 
  inquiry’s mandate extends to examining acts of torture or ill-treatment carried 
  out by security forces in Israel. 
<p><b>Case studies</b> 
<p><b>Arrests in Kufar Kana</b> 
<p>Amnesty International delegates visited the Palestinian village of Kufar Kana 
  in the Galilee on 27 October. Six different families described the intimidating 
  tactics used by the Israeli police, including the Special Patrol Unit, and Border 
  Police whilst conducting arrests during the previous week. They reported that 
  all the arrests took place in the early hours of the morning. Armed police, 
  sometimes including officers masked with balaclavas, surrounded the targeted 
  house. They entered the house with guns drawn. They normally searched the house, 
  often damaging property in the process. In two cases reported to Amnesty International, 
  the police used dogs for the searches. These methods terrified families, particularly 
  young children. 
<p>The police came to arrest Bakr Sa’id, a 15 year old, at 2am in the morning 
  on 24 October. The police had just arrested his cousin, Muhammad Jamil Sa’id, 
  aged 17, from another house in the village. About a dozen armed officers surrounded 
  the house. The police knocked and kicked at the door. The family refused to 
  open the door until the police showed them an arrest order issued by a magistrates 
  court. As soon as the family opened the door, four police officers with machine 
  guns drawn entered the house. Bakr Sa’id’s mother, Nadia Sa’id, gathered some 
  of her children into one room as she was afraid that the police might open fire. 
  The police asked for Bakr Sa’id. His father told them that he was sleeping. 
  The four armed police officers accompanied the father into the room where Bakr 
  Sa’id was sleeping. The police arrested him; they gave his family a telephone 
  number and told them that they should call later to find out where Bakr Sa’id 
  was being held. The police called later to say that they intended to bring the 
  boy to court the following day. Three interrogators in civilian clothes reportedly 
  interrogated Bakr Sa’id for several hours in the early hours of the morning, 
  shouting at him and threatening him. Another detainee, Muhammad 'Abbas, who 
  was arrested from Kufar Kana the same morning could hear the police officers 
  shouting. Bakr Sa’id was brought to court later the same day. His father went 
  to the magistrates court to see his son, but was not allowed to talk to him. 
  Muhammad Abbas saw him in court; he said that when he tried to communicate with 
  Bakr Sa’id, a police officer slapped the boy. On 2 November a magistrates court 
  agreed to Bakr Sa’id and Muhammad Sa’id’s release on bail. The Office of the 
  State Attorney appealed against the decision to the District Court the following 
  day. The District Court refused the appeal and the two boys were released on 
  3 November. 
<p>The police came to arrest ‘Abd al-Ra’uf ‘Aqayleh, a construction worker, aged 
  32, at about 2am on 23 October. The first that his mother, Amneh ‘Aqayleh, knew 
  of the presence of police officers was a banging on her window. She asked who 
  was there and heard a voice say: “Police.” Four armed police officers rushed 
  through the door. They arrested ‘Abd al-Ra’uf ‘Aqayleh and searched the house. 
  The next day Amneh ‘Aqayleh went to the Moscobiyyeh detention centre in Nazareth 
  to take cigarettes and clothes for her son. She was told to go to the court, 
  but could not find him there. In fact, ‘Abd al-Ra’uf ‘Aqayleh was held incommunicado 
  until his release on 26 October. Shortly after his arrest he was taken to Kishon 
  detention centre where was interrogated, apparently by the GSS. On the first 
  day of his detention he was interrogated continuously for about nine hours. 
  Interrogators reportedly beat him on the final day and banged his head against 
  the wall. When he was released from Kishon detention centre on 26 October, the 
  police refused to give him permission to call his family. He walked down to 
  the main road, where he fainted. 
<p><b>Arrests in Majd al-Kroum </b> 
<p>An Amnesty International delegate also visited the village of Majd al-Kroum 
  on 27 October. The police had arrested seven residents, including children, 
  of the Palestinian village of Majd al-Kroum in the Galilee and two of them remained 
  in detention. Two of those arrested reported being beaten by police. 
<p>On 23 October Khatib ‘Ali, aged 18, was on his way home to Majd al-Kroum from 
  high school with two other students. According to Khatib ‘Ali’s account, as 
  they were getting on the bus, the driver racially abused Khatib ‘Ali and accused 
  him of throwing stones at his bus in the past. Khatib ‘Ali said that an older 
  Jewish woman told the driver to stop abusing him. 
<p>The driver refused to drop the three students off in Majd al-Kroum; he drove 
  them instead to the police station in Karmiel and reportedly told the police 
  there that Khatib ‘Ali had been making insulting statements about Jews and had 
  stoned his bus. The police took Khatib ‘Ali to a room and started interrogating 
  him about what he had said to the driver. He denied making any statements insulting 
  to Jews and said that the driver had insulted Arabs; he also denied throwing 
  stones at the bus. One officer said: “You could get 26 years in prison for what 
  you have said and done.” Khatib ‘Ali said that he was kicked and punched as 
  he was being interrogated. He was then handcuffed to the bars of a window in 
  a cell. He received no medical attention for the injuries caused by the beating 
  apart from an ice pack to put on his face. The following day he was brought 
  before the Acre magistrates court with the two other students. His lawyer informed 
  the judge that Khatib ‘Ali had been beaten by the police. The judge recommended 
  that he be examined by a police doctor within a reasonable time and extended 
  his detention for two days. Khatib ‘Ali was held until 26 October, when he was 
  released on bail. An Amnesty International delegate interviewed Khatib ‘Ali 
  on 27 October, the day after he was released The area around his right eye was 
  bruised and an area behind his right ear was both bruised and swollen. 
<p><b>Arrests in Sha’b on 2 October </b> 
<p>Amnesty International also interviewed Qadr al-Wa’el, aged 20, in Majd al-Kroum. 
  The Border Police arrested him in his village of Sha’b, also in the Galilee, 
  at about 10pm on 2 October with five of his friends, following a demonstration 
  in the village earlier that day. Qadr al-Wa’el said that two police officers 
  beat him with the butts of their rifles while he was being transferred to Misgav 
  police station. He said that two police officers also beat him in the police 
  station. Five other police officers, who were either in or near the cell, reportedly 
  witnessed the beating. Qadr al-Wa’el showed Amnesty International’s delegate 
  bruises on his lower legs which stretched down to his ankles. Qadr al-Wa’el 
  limped very slowly and said that he was still in pain. He informed the judge 
  at his remand hearing in court that he had been beaten by police officers. After 
  being transferred to three other lock-ups, he was released on bail on 27 October. 
<p><b>Arrests in Haifa on 2 October </b> 
<p>According to reports received by Amnesty International, at about 5pm on 2 October 
  the police arrested nine people, as protestors blocked a road and demonstrated 
  peacefully in the Wadi Nisnas neighbourhood in downtown Haifa. As the police 
  arrested the nine, they beat them. Following the arrests and beatings, some 
  of the demonstrators began to throw stones at the police. The police reacted 
  by firing rubber-coated metal bullets at the legs of the demonstrators. 
<p>Lawyers who attempted to see the detainees were reportedly refused access by 
  the police. Six were released soon after their arrest; the other three were 
  held in custody until midnight; despite their requests they were refused medical 
  treatment for their injuries. The police finally allowed a lawyer to see the 
  detainees at about 10pm. When she entered, the three men were sitting handcuffed 
  to a bench. It was apparent to the lawyer that the three detainees needed urgent 
  medical attention; she asked the officer in charge why they had not been taken 
  to hospital. He said: "I don’t have the staff to do this." According to the 
  lawyer, in another room a group of police officers were watching a sports match 
  on television. The three detainees were finally released at about midnight after 
  they signed undertakings not to throw stones and not to enter Wadi Nisnas for 
  four days. 
<p>Yoav Bar, a computer programmer, was one of the demonstrators arrested by police 
  in Wadi Nisnas on 2 October. He described how immediately after his arrest he 
  was dragged by the legs for more than 50 meters by two police officers with 
  his back sliding along the street, while other police officers beat him with 
  batons. He was put in a police car where he was beaten by the driver before 
  being transferred to another police vehicle. Yoav Bar said that he told the 
  police that he thought his hand was broken; the police refused to give him any 
  medical treatment. According to Yoram Bar Haim, another detainee, one officer 
  reportedly said: "It’s a shame they didn’t break your head." He was released 
  about midnight. Yoav Bar sought medical treatment following his release in Rambam 
  Hospital in Haifa. His left hand was broken in three places; two of his ribs 
  were broken; and two of his front teeth were broken. His back was also injured 
  as a result of being dragged along the street. 
<p>Yoram Bar Haim was also arrested. According to his account, he approached police 
  officers as he saw Yoav Bar being ill-treated by police. A police officer attempted 
  to hit him with his baton and another jumped on his back so that Yoram Bar Haim 
  fell to the ground on his face. He was dragged along the ground while police 
  officers hit him with batons and kicked him all over his body. The police put 
  him in a police car with his head hanging out of the window. As the car reversed, 
  a police officer hit him on the head with a baton. The car stopped and officers 
  pulled him out of the vehicle, picked him up to a height of about one meter 
  and dropped him on the ground on his back. Yoram Bar Haim was then transferred 
  to the police station, where he was held until about midnight. Yoram Bar Haim 
  said he suffered a great deal of pain in his left foot and his ribs as a result 
  of being beaten. 
<p><b>ARRESTS IN EAST JERUSALEM </b> 
<p>Since 29 September hundreds of Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem have 
  been arrested by the Israel Police and the Border Police. Some have been arrested 
  during demonstrations, others during night raids on their homes. As of 9 November 
  the arrests continue. Most of the Palestinians arrested have been accused of 
  committing public order offences, damaging property or stonethrowing. At least 
  200 Palestinians from East Jerusalem were believed to be in detention on 7 November. 
  Jewish Israelis living in Jerusalem have also been arrested, mostly for their 
  alleged involvement in stonethrowing incidents and attacks on Palestinian property; 
  a small number are still in custody. 
<p>Detainees in Jerusalem have faced the same difficulties in obtaining bail as 
  has been the case inside Israel.2 Amnesty International has received many reports 
  of police brutality directed against Palestinians, including children, either 
  during arrest or in custody in East Jerusalem. The Israeli organization B’Tselem 
  documented two cases in which police beat Palestinians on 29 September in the 
  vicinity of the al-Aqsa mosque compound.3 On 14 October CNN broadcast footage 
  of three police undercover agents (must’arabin) arresting three stonethrowing 
  Palestinians in Jerusalem the previous day.4 The video shows a police officer 
  apparently punching a Palestinian in the head five times while holding him in 
  a headlock. Another police officer is shown putting his foot on the back of 
  another immobile Palestinian while putting a mask on his head. 
<p><b>Case studies</b> 
<p><b>Arrests in Shu’fat neighbourhood, on 1 October </b> 
<p>AI Iyad Qaymeri, aged 17, and Usama Ahmad Abu Zayneh, aged 19, and two other 
  Palestinians were arrested in Shu’fat in East Jerusalem, at about 9.30pm on 
  1 October 2000. Iyad Qaymeri and Usama Abu Zayneh were amongst a group of about 
  30 young men and boys out on the street outside their homes; some were throwing 
  stones at passing vehicles. A bus containing soldiers in civilian clothes was 
  passing; the bus stopped and a group of soldiers descended and started chasing 
  the Palestinians. It is reported that five soldiers set upon Iyad Qaymeri, pushing 
  him to the ground and kicking him on his body and in his face on the street. 
  As they attacked him they yelled insults. The beating lasted about five minutes. 
  Soldiers also reportedly beat Usama Ahmad Abu Zayneh with a baton, particularly 
  on his face, his left side and on his legs; as a result his right leg swelled 
  up. Iyad Qaymeri and Usama Ahmad Abu Zayneh and the two other Palestinians were 
  put on the bus and forced to lie on the floor; their hands were shackled behind 
  their back. The soldiers took them to what appeared to be a military camp where 
  they remained for about two hours. They were hooded and forced to lie on the 
  ground. From time to time someone would come and kick them or hit them. The 
  four Palestinians were then taken to the Moscobiyyeh detention centre. Iyad 
  Qaymeri and Usama Ahmad Abu Zayneh were both interrogated separately for about 
  an hour by the police as to whether they had been involved in stonethrowing. 
  They stated that each time they were asked a question, the interrogator would 
  slap them on the face. The handcuffs were finally removed after the interrogation, 
  in the early morning. By that time their arms felt very painful. Iyad Qaymeri 
  and Usama Ahmad Abu Zayneh were detained until 5 October. The night before his 
  release, about 20 police officers entered the section where Iyad Qaymeri and 
  about 30 other Palestinian detainees under the age of 18 were held and randomly 
  beat them up with their batons whilst yelling insults at them. 
<p><b>Arrests in Lion’s Gate neighbourhood, Old City, on 16 October </b> 
<p>In the early hours of the morning on 16 October, plainclothes police officers 
  and Border Police arrested a group of Palestinians living in Lion’s Gate neighbourhood 
  in East Jerusalem in the Old City. They were all taken for interrogation at 
  the Jaffa Gate police station in the Old City before being transferred to the 
  Moscobiyyeh detention centre. The police and Border Police reportedly physically 
  assaulted several of these detainees following their arrest and later in detention. 
<p>Ahmad Fu’ad al-Shawish, aged 23, Murad ‘Azmi al-Bakri, aged 19, and ‘Imad al-Shalouhi, 
  aged 31, were arrested on the street near their homes between 1am and 2am by 
  a group of about ten armed police agents, including officers in civilian clothes 
  and Border Police. They were taken down to an area near the Western Wall where 
  the police were holding young Palestinians whom they had arrested in the Old 
  City. Later, Ahmad’s brothers arrived, Jamal Fu’ad al-Shawish and ‘Ali Fu’ad 
  al-Shawish; a group of about 25 agents had crowded into the tiny courtyard of 
  the al-Shawish family’s home at about 3am and arrested them. ‘Imad’s brother, 
  Samir al-Shalouhi was also brought to the Western Wall, after being arrested 
  at his home by a joint force of about 10 agents, backed up by 12 further agents 
  waiting outside. At the Western Wall Plaza an agent in civilian clothes and 
  a border guard approached Ahmad al-Shawish and asked him to stand up. One of 
  them grabbed Ahmad al-Shawish’s face with both hands and squeezed it. The two 
  agents started punching and kicking him in the face and on his legs. Ahmad al-Shawish 
  had previously sustained multiple fractures in his leg and the beating therefore 
  was extremely painful. Police officers also physically attacked Samir al-Shalouhi, 
  particularly in the face and on the eye. 
<p>The police transferred the detainees to Jaffa Gate Police Station. They were 
  all interrogated separately and were accused of being involved in stonethrowing 
  incidents; some were also accused of setting light to the police station in 
  Lion’s Gate on 6 October. Ahmad Fu’ad al-Shawish, Jamal Fu’ad al-Shawish and 
  Murad ‘Azmi al-Bakri were asked to sign a statement saying that they had not 
  been beaten during detention. They said that after they had signed the statement 
  police officers in civilian clothes assaulted them. Ahmad al-Shawish was punched 
  hard in the face; three agents in civilian clothes punched Jamal Fu’ad al-Shawish 
  in various parts of his body; three agents punched Murad al-Bakri in the face. 
<p>Later that day the six detainees were taken to the magistrates court. Their 
  detention was extended until 20 October. All six detainees continued to be held 
  in the Moscobiyyeh detention centre. On the first morning after his arrest, 
  Ahmad al-Shawish had a headache. At about 1.30 am he banged on the door and 
  asked the guards to bring him aspirin. A guard came and told him to bring his 
  blanket. He was put in an isolation cell two meters’ square for about seven 
  hours. The cell was extremely dirty and contained a toilet. Light was provided 
  by an electric light. There was no bed. ‘Imad al-Shalouhi remembers being put 
  in a similar isolation cell three or four times during the four days he spent 
  in detention centre for periods of about five hours because he asked the police 
  to bring him various things, like water and soap. 
<p>All six detainees were released on bail at about 8pm on the evening of 20 October 
  after an agreement was reached between their lawyers and the State Attorney’s 
  Office. Bail was subject to conditions, including a requirement of seven days’ 
  house arrest. 
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </b> 
<p>Out of at least 1,000 people, mostly Palestinians, arrested since 29 September, 
  dozens have reported that they were subjected to physical violence and psychological 
  pressure after arrest by Israeli police officers and Border Police. Israel’s 
  own standards for protection of children under arrest and detention were frequently 
  breached. 
<p>Amnesty International calls for reports of beatings and other ill-treatment 
  by the Israeli Police and Border Police to be thoroughly investigated and for 
  those who are suspected of carrying out such human rights abuses to be brought 
  to justice. Only so will the culture of violence against Palestinians, whether 
  citizens of Israel or not, which has been encouraged by impunity, be ended. 
<p>Amnesty International makes the following recommendations: 
</font>
<ul>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">The Israel Police and the Border Police should 
    immediately cease the use of torture or ill-treatment, whether physical or 
    psychological, of any detainee in their custody. The Israeli authorities should 
    make clear that torture or ill-treatment of any person will not be tolerated. 
    </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should bring to justice in accordance 
    with international human rights standards any person against whom there is 
    evidence that he or she carried out acts of torture or ill-treatment. </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should comply with its obligations 
    under Article 37(a) and (c) of the Convention on the Rights of Child by refraining 
    from arrest, detention or imprisonment of children except as a measure of 
    last resort and for the shortest appropriate time. It must ensure that any 
    child deprived of his or her liberty is treated with humanity and respect 
    for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes 
    into account the needs of persons of his of her age. </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should ensure that all detainees have 
    access to relatives and lawyers without delay after arrest and regularly thereafter. 
    </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should ensure that allegations of torture 
    or ill-treatment or other human rights abuses are promptly, impartially and 
    effectively investigated by a body independent of the alleged perpetrators. 
    The methods and findings of such investigations should be made public. </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should ensure that any person who complains 
    about human rights abuses is protected from ill-treatment or intimidation 
    as a consequence of his or her complaint or any evidence given. </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">The Commission of Inquiry established by the 
    Israeli government on 8 November to investigate clashes with security forces 
    in which Palestinian and Jewish Israeli citizens were killed and wounded should 
    adhere to international standards for thorough, effective and independent 
    investigations. It should investigate incidents of torture or ill-treatment 
    by the security forces and denial of access to lawyers. </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should make reparation, including payment 
    of compensation, to the victims of torture or ill-treatment and other human 
    rights abuses. </font></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Israel should ensure that any person who is 
    brought to justice in connection with the demonstrations and disturbances 
    occurring since 29 September 2000 receives a fair trial, consistent with international 
    human rights standards. </font></li>
