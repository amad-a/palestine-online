POSITION PAPER ON THE UPRISING IN THE PALESTINIAN
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

<p>NOVEMBER 2000


<p>Since 28 September, violence has engulfed our region.  Israeli
troops
have employed not only rubber-coated or plastic-coated metal
bullets
and tear gas, but high-velocity live ammunition, helicopter gun-
ships,
tanks and heavy artillery against largely defenceless Palestinian
protesters and bystanders.  Even people within their homes have
been
targeted by Israeli gunfire and have suffered casualties.  The death
toll stands at over 225 and is rising daily, with more than 7000
people injured.

<p>Numerous human rights observers have recorded a high child casualty
rate, as well as a 'shoot to kill' policy, evident in the frequency of
upper body wounds.  As of 8 November, LAW, a Jerusalem-based
Palestinian human rights organisation, reported that Israeli military
personnel or settlers had killed 49 children (under the age of 18) and
had injured approximately 1,700.  Of the 49 killed, more than half
died from bullet wounds to their heads.  The Palestinian Happy Child
Centre has reported that 18% of injured children are either clinically
dead or in critical condition and that 20% are likely to suffer from a
permanent disability.  Defence for Children International (DCI) -
Palestine Section reported after the first month of violence that
about half of the injured children had suffered upper body wounds.  In
recent weeks, observers have noted that the incidence of upper body
wounds has risen to over 80% of cases, while the frequency of live
ammunition injuries has risen from less than a quarter of the cases to
over 80%.

<p>At the same time, medical personnel have been impeded from performing
their life-saving duties and have, in certain incidents, been directly
targeted by Israeli gunfire.  In its report on the current uprising,
Human Rights Watch recorded a pattern of Israeli violation of medical
neutrality through "…the repeated use of lethal force against
Palestinian ambulances, medical personnel, field hospitals and clinics
engaged in treating or evacuating injured civilians. The use of live
fire against medical personnel interferes with the prompt treatment of
wounded, and may in some instances have resulted in additional
deaths."  This type of interference is a blatant violation of UN
principles as well as the Fourth Geneva Convention.







<p>In addition to violating the civil and political rights of
Palestinians, Israel has also infringed on economic, social and
cultural rights.  Israel implements a two-tiered policy of closure:
general closure has been in place since 1993 and prohibits
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza from entering Israel and East
Jerusalem unless they obtain a permit. Since the beginning of the
current uprising, all of these permits have been revoked, causing high
unemployment as thousands of Palestinians are unable to reach their
place of work inside Israel.  Meanwhile, general closure impedes
Palestinians from travelling freely within the Palestinian territories
by slicing the territories into three detached areas: the Gaza Strip
and two parts of the West Bank - north and south - cut in two by
Israeli-controlled Jerusalem and its surrounding settlements.

<p>At the same time, a policy of internal closure has been periodically
invoked over the past several weeks to seal Palestinian villages and
towns, prohibiting movement between urban centres and literally
imprisoning entire communities in their villages or towns.  Most
cruelly, the Palestinians of Hebron have been under total closure and
curfew since the beginning of the uprising, completely barred from
leaving their homes.

<p>Israel has made clear its intention to 'punish' the Palestinian
Authority for 'failing to contain the violence' by economic
strangulation, a policy which serves to collectively punish the entire
 Palestinian population. This policy will continue to have a
disastrous effect on the Palestinian economy and seriously impedes
access to schools, medical care, medicine and food.  These conditions
make it impossible for many Palestinians to continue with their lives
and deprive them of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights;
for children to attend school and play outside, for people to work and
support their families, and for parents to rear their children in a
safe and healthy environment.  All forms of collective punishment are
strictly prohibited under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.


<p>Israeli Provocation and Excessive Use of Force

<p>There is an international consensus that the recent events in the
Palestinian occupied territories were ignited by Israeli provocation
and have been exacerbated by the excessive use of lethal force by
Israeli security personnel.  According to an Amnesty International
report of 19 October, Israeli troops have violated not only
international standards for law enforcement officials, but also
Israel's own internal rules of engagement for the occupied
territories.

<p>The United Nations Commission on Human Rights most recently affirmed
this in its resolution of 19 October condemning the "disproportionate
and indiscriminate use of force" by Israel against Palestinian
civilians - actions which it determined constitute 'war crimes' and
'crimes against humanity'.  This reinforced UN Security Council
Resolution 1322 of 7 October calling for Israel to "abide scrupulously
by its legal obligations and its responsibilities under the Fourth
Geneva Convention…" and condemning "the excessive use of force against
Palestinians…."

<p>Despite the consensus that Israeli actions against the Palestinian
civilian population constitute grave violations of international human
rights and humanitarian law, to date the international community has
failed to take concrete steps to ensure the security of Palestinian
civilians.  This has been a serious shortcoming of the states of the
world and may indeed constitute a violation of their own obligations
under the Fourth Geneva Convention to "ensure respect" of the
Convention.

<p>WCLAC welcomes the pronouncements of the international community on
Israel's wanton and excessive use of force against Palestinians,
including many children.  However, we urge international bodies to
expedite the processes of investigation and intervention mandated by
their pronouncements, and implore the states of the world to take
immediate action on behalf of Palestinian civilians to stop the
killing and ensure the security of our people.

<p>Smear Campaign - Muting the Voices of the Victim

<p>Of particular concern to WCLAC during the course of the events of the
past two months has been the media's portrayal of the conflict.  Much
of the western media has adopted the language and terminology of the
Israeli leadership, which seek to blame the victim (the Palestinians)
for the recent round of violence.

<p>This has been manifested in the use of such code words as
"provocation", "cross-fire", "Palestinian terror", "Israeli defence",
"cease-fire" and "siege".  Through the use of these and other terms,
the Palestinians have been presented as the aggressors, besieging
Israel, destroying the peace process and stubbornly refusing to
cooperate with Israeli and American attempts to restore calm to the
region.  In reality, the use of deadly force has been almost
exclusively unilateral and the casualties overwhelmingly one-sided.
Israeli forces have responded to demonstrations and civil disobedience
with lethal force, while claiming that its actions are guided by the
principle of 'self-defence'.

<p>The status of the Palestinian victims in this political context is not
without parallels  in gender based violence and power relations.  It
has been well studied that   crimes against oppressed groups have the
effect of increasing the pain and suffering of  the vulnerable  within
that oppressed group. This leads to double  victimisation of  the
latter.  It is more convenient  to manufacture reasons why the victim
was  the cause of her own victimisation than to examine causes  that
might undermine the vested interests of the powerful.  As a result,
the voice of the disempowered victim is effectively silenced leading
to further victimisation of the victim.

<p>As with gender violence, Israeli power and international (particularly
American) interests have succeeded in placing the blame for the
killing of Palestinian civilians squarely on the shoulders of the
Palestinians themselves.  In doing so, Israel has sought (and
succeeded) to divert attention from the real issues and focus solely
on the Palestinian leadership, who have been repeatedly blamed for
orchestrating the events as an attempt to achieve political objectives
through the use of violence.

<p>The acceptance of the Israeli interpretation of the conflict by many
states, particularly in the West, has resulted in criticisms of the
Palestinian leadership for not taking effective steps to halt the
uprising.  However, what is being demanded of Palestinian leaders is
essentially to silence dissenting voices and the public will, and to
return to negotiating within a 'peace process' that is inherently
unbalanced and which can only lead to a settlement that favours the
more powerful of the parties: Israel.  Meanwhile, all but overlooked
are the plight and suffering of the Palestinian people and their
frustrations over the Oslo process, which has failed in its seven
years to achieve a just solution to the conflict.

<p>This Intifada is a direct message from the Palestinian people to the
political power brokers that the people demand to be heard.  Indeed,
any resumption of 'peace talks' will have to seriously consider what
Palestinian people are saying.  However, by adopting the Israeli
narrative, diverting attention from the real issues and focusing on
the role of the Palestinian leadership in the violence, the western
media have been for the most part complicit in this distraction tactic
which silences the voices of the Palestinian people and prolongs their
suffering.

<p>The crux of Palestinian frustration is the failure of Oslo to ensure
the realisation of their internationally recognised rights.  Israeli
policy and action throughout the 'peace process' indicated that Israel
was not serious about reaching a balanced peace with the Palestinians.
 Israel consistently failed to adequately implement many of its
commitments, while increasing settlement construction and intensifying
efforts to Judaise Jerusalem.  A similar pattern has emerged in this
latest round of violence, as Israel (with the tacit support of the
U.S.) has succeeded in marginalising international humanitarian law,
UN resolutions and human rights, while obfuscating the just claims and
grievances of the Palestinian people.  In this absurd tragedy, the
victims (the Palestinians) have ended up as the 'aggressors', while
the assailant (Israel) has emerged as the 'only remaining peace
partner'.

<p>Palestinian Women - Demonised and De-humanised

<p>The most disturbing aspect of the Israeli public smear campaign
against the Palestinian uprising has been its attack on Palestinian
women, who have been accused of urging their children on to death.
This accusation is superficially supported by video images of
Palestinian women remaining defiant at their sons' funerals, seeming
to refuse to mourn and, in some cases, seeming to 'celebrate' the
death.  The picture as it is painted, however, fails to consider all
of the factors and makes no attempt to truly understand the local
culture and what these mothers are going through - psychologically,
emotionally or socially.  The image is constructed to dehumanise and
demonise Palestinian women, and fits into the broader propaganda
campaign to portray the Palestinians as irrational, obstinate,
vindictive and simply, inhuman.

<p>The fact is that Palestinian mothers are indeed human, and like all
mothers, do not wish to see their children murdered.  This proposition
seems rather self-evident, but in the face of the rather insensitive
statements of such prominent 'women' and 'mothers' as U.S. Secretary
of State, Madeleine Albright and Her Majesty Sylvia Beatrice, Queen of
Sweden, the point cannot be stressed enough.

<p>Palestinian mothers grieve over the loss of their children.  They
grieve even harder when they have to witness their child bleeding to
death or lying stiff with a bullet in his head.  How these women
express their grief is not entirely important.  Finding consolation in
the idea that their child is safe in a better world, that he died for
a cause, or even that his blood may be redeemed with the blood of the
enemy may ease the pain for some, but can never fill the empty space
in their home, or heal the gaping wound in their heart.

<p>The Future of Palestinian Society: Double Victimisation

<p>In recent weeks, hundreds of Palestinian women have had to absorb the
loss of children, brothers and fathers.  The emotional and
psychological trauma of this will carry with it effects well into the
future.  For every child that has been buried in recent weeks, gone
with him are the dreams and hopes of a young human being, and those of
his entire family.  Women bereaved by the loss of a loved one must
cope with more than just the loss of life, but with the loss of spirit
and hope - things that require much effort and support to rebuild.

<p>While it is important to offer support services for women who have
suffered a loss, it is equally crucial to ensure that adequate
services are made available to entire families, including principal
breadwinners, who have been exposed to and traumatised by political
violence.  A failure to meet these needs immediately will hinder the
healing process and facilitate the emergence of problems in the
future.  Particularly dangerous is that, without proper treatment,
people will internalise the violence.  As a result, Palestinian
society will be forced to pay the price of the recent events twice;
first, now with the suffering and death, and later, with the long-term
social implications of untreated trauma.  It is likely that women will
become prime targets for male frustrations and internalised violence
within the domestic sphere, becoming the ultimate victims of the
recent uprising.

<p>In a well-received recent development, the UN Security Council
unanimously adopted resolution 1044 on 31 October,2000.  The
resolution holds governments accountable for the protection of girls
and women in times of armed conflict, calls for gender sensitivity in
all UN missions (including peace-keeping) and demands equal
participation of women at all processes of peace negotiation.  The
resolution recognises that "…women and children account for the vast
majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict, including as
refugees and internally displaced persons, and increasingly are
targeted by combatants and armed elements…."  Moreover, the Security
Council called on political actors, when negotiating and implementing
a peace agreement, to adopt a gender perspective, particularly in
taking account of the special needs of women and girls, and ensuring
the protection of their fundamental human rights.

<p>This resolution reflects a reality that is well known to the women of
Palestine.  During the first Intifada (1987-93) and in the period
thereafter, the political violence profoundly impacted on the lives of
women.  It has been well documented how the violence directed at the
Palestinian people as a whole by the Israeli occupation was correlated
by a sharp increase in the level of violence directed against women
within the home.

<p>The implications of this trend continued long after the Oslo Accords
were signed and the Israeli and Palestinian leaders became 'partners
in peace'. Without an adequate social service sector in the
Palestinian territories, many men who had experienced trauma were left
without proper necessary treatment.  Women ultimately bore the brunt
of much of this suffering, becoming targets for untreated, disturbed
male family members and lacking access to support services to deal
with their own suffering.

<p>For this reason, it is crucial that we do not allow ourselves to be
victimised twofold by the Israeli aggression.  We cannot fall into a
similar pattern as in the past, watching our progress recede, while
allowing the violence that has been carried out against our society to
be re-directed against women and girls within our homes.

<p>Conclusion

<p>A political solution must be found for the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict. This solution will not be reached through war, but rather
through negotiation.  Any final settlement, however, must be premised
on the complete withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territories
occupied in 1967 and the full implementation of all relevant UN
resolutions.  This must include the establishment of a Palestinian
state with its capital in East Jerusalem, the dismantling of Jewish
settlements and the recognition of the right of return for Palestinian
refugees.  In addition to reaching a final political settlement, it is
essential for the fostering of sustainable peace, that there be a
process of reconciliation between the peoples of Israel and Palestine,
Jews and Arabs.  Only by reconciling ourselves with the past and
recognising historical legacy of suffering and injustice can we hope
to build a stable and secure future for all peoples of this land.

<p>As a women's legal and social work service and advocacy institution,
we firmly believe that the social ills within Palestinian society
cannot be solved without a permanent, just political solution to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  The cycle of violence that revisits our
region at regular intervals has a devastating impact on development in
all spheres.  Indeed, working for social development is impossible
under the current circumstances.  For this reason, we insist that a
just political situation is the only basis upon which a viable
Palestinian state can be established in which the rights and freedoms
of all citizens, both women and men, are respected and the rule of law
upheld.

<p>For now, people need to deal with their grief and trauma immediately.
We must provide services addressing issues of death, loss, violence
and crisis management.  Not only must we bury our dead and heal our
injured; there are emotional, psychological and social wounds which
must be tended to as well.  Indeed, this is our great challenge if we
are to gain something from this crisis and attempt to lay the
foundations for a better, stronger future for our people.<p align=right><a href="#top">return to top</a>
