<h3>Addameer Prisoners Support and Human Rights Association</h3>
<p><b>
Report on Palestinian Prisoners as of 29 September 2000 -
1 November  2000

  </b></p>

<p>Beginning on 29 September 2000, the first day of unprecedented
violence and clashes in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and 1948
Palestinian areas, mass arrest campaigns have been routinely
conducted by the Israeli security forces and police.  These arrest
campaigns have not only targeted Palestinians living in the
occupied Palestinian territories, but also included on a large scale
Palestinians living within 1948 Palestinian areas, targeting those
who allegedly participated in recent protests against Israeli
occupation.

<p>The Israeli authorities have recently admitted to the fact that they
have been using special under-cover units within 1948 Palestinian
areas to infiltrate the Palestinian community, identify and arrest
individuals. Statements reveal that the unit's activity was "similar to
operations carried out by comparable mistaravim undercover IDF
and Border Police personnel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
Umm al Fahm undercover agents belonged to a Border Police unit
which is deployed in northern areas…" (See Haaretz Article"Border
Police go undercover in Umm al Fahm during unrest", by Sharon
Gal, 25 October 2000).  This unit's assignment is to work among
Palestinian protesters, monitor them and collect information to
reveal the identity of those most active and those individuals
participating while wearing masks, in order to arrest them in the
future.

<p>The Israeli authorities have announced that they have arrested
more than 450 Palestinians from Jerusalem and from within 1948
Palestinian areas.  The number of Palestinians arrested in the
West Bank and Gaza is difficult to ascertain, as the Israeli
authorities have not announced exact numbers.  Human rights
organizations are experiencing extreme difficulties in documenting
arrests as a result of the strict Israeli closure placed on the
occupied Palestinian territories.

<p>It has become evident that the Israeli police and the General
Prosecution are actively working together in conducting arrest
campaigns and presenting charges against detainees primarily
related to stone throwing. The Israeli judicial system is clearly in
full support of and is facilitating these mass arrest campaigns, as
the sentences for these charges has become relatively higher. The
vast majority of detainees against whom charges are brought are
imprisoned until all legal proceedings against them are completed.
The release on bail of these detainees has been prohibited, further
pointing the finger of implication of the support of Israel's judicial
system of these arrest campaigns.  The Israeli High Court of
Justice, presided by Judge 'Heshin', stated that in such situations
detainees may not be released on bail, even if they are minors.

<p>Cases of Physical Abuse<br>
Palestinians who have been detained recently are being beaten and
subjected to torture during their detention and interrogation.  One
such case is being followed up by Addameer, that of 15 year old
Iyad Kayed Qaymari, who was arrested in Shu'faat Refugee Camp
in Jerusalem.  At the time of his arrest, Iyad was subjected to
torture, severely beaten all over his body.  16 year old Usama
Ahmad Abu Zeina was also subjected to torture by severe beating
during his arrest.  In an affidavit, Usama stated that one of the
Israeli soldiers who arrested him forcibly held his right leg straight
up while another soldier beat him on the same leg with a baton and
the back of his machine gun.  The beating resulted in severe
swelling in his right foot, after which he was denied by his
interrogators proper medical attention or transfer to a hospital for
medical care.  His leg was simply bandaged by a nurse at the
interrogation centre.   In each case, both Iyad and Usama were
later released without charge or trial.

<p>As'ad Zeid, 36 years old from Jalazoun Refugee Camp, Ramallah
was arrested by Israeli soldiers and subjected to severe beating
over his entire body.  At least one of his ribs was broken as a
result of the beating. As'ad was denied access to medical care and
was refused an x-ray to determine if any damage was done to his
chest, despite the fact that he was vomiting blood.  Following his
release, As'ad sought medical care, and is currently experiencing
medical complications.

<p>Tareq Ziadeh, 17 years old, was also subjected to severe beating
over his entire body and tortured while blindfolded during his arrest.

<p>Two brothers from the Sa'dieh neighbourhood in the Old City of
Jerusalem, Salah Eddin Abu Farha, 25 years old and Naser Eddin
Abu Farha, 31 years old, were arrested and beaten by Israeli
police.  Naser was severely beaten and tortured during his arrest.
Israeli police later released them both without charge or trial, and
without justification for the brutal behaviour inflicted on them.

<p>Mohammad Zeid Adib Masroojeh, 23 years old from Nablus and a
driver for a Palestinian Minister, was stopped at an Israeli
checkpoint and arrested.  After his arrest he was subjected to
severe beating and torture, causing swelling in several parts of his
body and severe internal bleeding in his kidneys.  He was admitted
to an Israeli hospital, where he remained for two days for medical
attention, after which he was transferred back to prison, despite the
fact that medical reports stated that he required further medical
attention.

<p>Failure of Israeli authorities to offer information on detentions<br>
On the afternoon of Wednesday 18 October 2000, 30 year old Ali
Alqam from Ramallah left his house to visit his fiancée in Al Ram.
He had intended to continue on to his work in Jericho after the visit.
He called a taxi from Ramallah to take him to his fiancée's home.
The taxi driver, a friend of the family, arrived to pick him up, but 
Ali
did not appear.  The taxi driver called Ali's family asking where Ali
was, after which his family called his fiancée's home to see if he
had gone on his own.  When they didn't find him there they called
his work in Jericho in search of him, only to be informed that he
had not gone to work.   Taking into consideration the overall
situation of Israeli soldiers and settlers attacking Palestinians on
main roads and farmers in their orchards, Ali's family, fiancée and
friends became concerned for his well-being and began searching
for him, including contacting Addameer.  Addameer's lawyer,
Advocate Sahar Francis, began searching for him in Israeli prisons,
detention and interrogation centres.   One of the detention centres
Addameer's lawyer contacted was the Russian Compound (Al
Muscobiyeh) Interrogation Centre, which informed her on 19
October at 3:30 PM that they did not have anyone by that name at
the interrogation centre.  Ali's fiancée, who holds a Jerusalemite
identity card, went to the interrogation centre in Jerusalem on 20
October, where she was finally informed that Ali was being
detained there. It took over 24 hours to locate Ali.  At that point, 
all
the family could hope for was to discover that Ali was alive.  The
news of his arrest was a sort of relief to his family, in light of the
very real possibility that he could have been kidnapped, killed by
Israeli settlers, or lying in a hospital bed, dead or injured by 
Israeli
soldiers.

<p>Addameer was officially denied information of Ali's whereabouts,
and would not have known of his arrest had his fiancée not gone
down to the detention centre herself and accidentally received
confirmation of his arrest from one of the guards, who prohibited her
from visiting him.  At the same time that his fiancée was finally
being informed that Ali was arrested, the Israeli authorities were
telling other organisations that they were not holding Ali at the
Russian Compound.  The Israeli organisation HAMOKED, who
were also informed that Ali was not arrested, called the Russian
Compound after being told by Ali's fiancée that he was there,
demanding an explanation.  They were not given clear or convincing
justification.  Four days later, Addameer's lawyer finally obtained
permission to visit Ali.  During the visit, the lawyer noted bruises
along Ali's forehead and when she asked him about it, he explained
that he had been severely beaten when he was arrested and that
he had been subjected to torture and abuse throughout his
interrogation.  Throughout his interrogation, Ali was continuously
and without interruption questioned, tortured and prevented from
sleeping for at least three days.

<p>Detention of minors<br>
On 2 November, Advocate Sahar Francis visited section 9 of
Telmond prison, designated for political prisoners who are minors,
which currently holds 31 Palestinian minors from the West Bank,
Jerusalem, 1948 Palestinian areas and from the occupied Golan
Heights, detained before 29 September.  Minors who were arrested
after 29 September, including between 20 to 25 detainees, have
been placed in cells in other sections of the prison designated for
minors who are being detained on criminal charges.  The Israeli
Prisons Administration claims that they are not responsible the
current distribution of Palestinian political prisoners who are minors
amongst criminal detainees, but rather that the Israeli judicial
system is to blame as these minors have been distributed in cells
according the classification of charges that have been brought
against them on their charge sheets.

<p>The danger of placing young political prisoners amongst criminal
prisoners is the fact that many of these detainees, between the
ages of 14 and 16 years, are being subjected to aggressive
behaviour from these criminal detainees and suffer from regular
attacks by them.  The majority of these minors are being arrested
for the first time, based on the charge of stone throwing.  There is a
great fear that these minors will be negatively effected by their
environment and be influenced towards criminal behaviour as a
result.

<p>Prison conditions faced by Palestinian minors<br>
Palestinian minors detained in section 9 of Telmond prison are
being faced with extremely difficult prison conditions.  The prison
administration has isolated and closed off sections holding
Palestinian political prisoners, permitting only two cells at a time to
leave their cells for a period of only one hour.  Family visits have
been prohibited, effecting these minors psychologically and
diminishing their morale.  The prevention of family visits also limits
the availability of items from the canteen within the prison, as the
minors do not have the money that their families bring for them to
purchase basic necessities.

<p>Approximately one month ago, detainee Nasser Ibrahim Zaid, 17
years old from Al Jalazoune Refugee Camp, formally requested to
be transferred to Megiddo Prison.  No response was given to his
request by the prison authorities.  There is an intentionally vague
policy from the prison administration to deal with such requests,
allowing for the study of the request for an extended period of time
and no designated time period for a response.  When Nasser
demanded an explanation from the director of the prison concerning
his request, a shouting match occurred between him and the
section officer.  As a result, he was transferred to Ramleh prison
and placed in solitary confinement in an underground cell.  He was
prohibited from taking any clothes or personal effects with him and
placed in a very small cell, 2 meters long and 1 meter wide, with a
very small window with several layers of steel grids on it.  Behind
the window is a wall, so no light comes into the cell.

<p>Nasser was left in solitary confinement for 13 consecutive days,
prohibited from leaving the cell for any purpose.  After 13 days,
Nasser began an open ended hunger strike, causing him severe
health problems, including low blood pressure and dizziness.
When he was taken out of the cell and transferred back to Telmond
Prison, cuffed by both his hands and legs and to another
policeman, he was again placed in solitary confinement.  He
resumed his hunger strike.  A prison nurse examined him upon his
arrival at Telmond, who requested that the detainee be brought to
the prison medical clinic because of his low blood pressure.
However, the next day Israeli guards and police refused to allow
him to go to the clinic and he remained in solitary confinement.
Only when his health situation worsened considerably was he
allowed to be taken to the clinic, and then the next day returned to
a regular cell.

<p>Administrative detainees<br>
The use of administrative detention, detention without charge or
trial for unlimited periods of time, has been re-implemented by the
Israeli authorities following 29 September.  Four Palestinians have
been placed under administrative detention after the recent
clashes, including:  Ahmad Daoud Afaneh, from Abu Dis, who was
placed under administrative detention on 17 October 2000;
Muhammad Aqel Muhammad Halaseh, from Abu Dis, who was
placed under administrative detention on 19 October 2000; Usama
Hasan Razeq Abu Hilal, from Abu Dis, who was placed under
administrative detention on 19 October 2000; Attallah Ahmad
Mousa Halabieh, from Abu Dis, who was placed under
administrative detention on 19 October 2000.
<p>
In addition to the renewal of administrative detention, a number of
Palestinian prisoners who were placed in administrative detention
prior to 29 September have had their administrative detention order
renewed.  The total number of Palestinians under administrative
detention is 10, including:
<ol>
<li>Khaled Husein Jaradat, from Silt Al Harthieh, Jenin, has been
under administrative detention since 2 August 1997.  On 19
October 2000 his detention was once more renewed.
<li> Mahmoud Hamdi Shabaneh, from Hebron, was transferred to
administrative detention on 16 September 1999. He was detained
and sentenced on 12 June 1994.  His sentence ended on 15
September 1999, after which he was transferred to administrative
detention without being released.
<li> Khader Qadous, from Hebron, was arrested and sentenced on
27 August 1997.  After his sentence ended he was transferred to
administrative detention on 28 August 1999.
<li> Muhammad Subhi Abu Tabeekh, from Hebron, was arrested and
sentenced on 13 October 1999 but transferred to administrative
detention on 15 August 2000 without being released.
<li> Ibrahim Abu Ajamieh, from Fawar Refugee Camp, Hebron, was
placed under administrative detention on 15 June 2000.
<li> Attallah Ahmad Mousa Halabieh, from Abu Dis, was placed
under administrative detention on 19 October 2000.
<li> Muhammad Amin Ali Seif, from Al Bireh, was placed under
administrative detention on 4 September 2000.  On 10 October
2000, his administrative detention orders were renewed.
<li> Ahmad Daoud Afaneh, from Abu Dis, was placed under
administrative detention on 17 October 2000.
<li> Muhammad Aqel Muhammad Halaseh, from Abu Dis, was
placed under administrative detention on 19 October 2000.
<li> Usama Hasan Razeq Abu Hilal, from Abu Dis was placed
under administrative detention on 19 October 2000.</ol>

<p>The use of torture against Palestinian detainees<br>
Despite an Israeli High Court of Justice order in September 1999
banning the use of torture during interrogation of Palestinian
detainees, the Israeli authorities continue to use torture as a form
on interrogation on Palestinian detainees.  Based on visits by
Addameer's advocate Sahar Francis to Israeli interrogation centres,
the following forms of torture are still being implemented:

<p>Beatings:  Palestinian detainees are being beaten at the time of
their arrest, whether from Israeli checkpoints or from their homes.
A number of cases have been documented in which detainees have
had broken bones, or have suffered from medical difficulties as a
result of being beaten.

<p>Position Abuse (Shabeh):   Palestinian detainees are placed in
painful positions during interrogation, usually handcuffed to very
small chairs in uncomfortable positions, for periods of time
exceeding 24 continuous hours.

<p>Collaborator Cells:  The use of collaborators cells to obtain
confessions from Palestinian detainees has become a more
widespread form of interrogation. Palestinian detainees are placed
in cells with collaborators and are then threatened and abused, at
times tricked into confessing to actions in which charges can be
brought against them.

<p>Sleep Depravation:  Israeli interrogators subject Palestinian
detainees to long sessions of interrogation that exceed in some
cases 48 continuous hours, where interrogators work in shifts in
order exhaust the detainee and prevent him from sleeping.

<p>Palestinian detainees have regularly been prevented from lawyer
visits, with legal counsel being denied for periods of 20-30
consecutive days.  Appeals by lawyers to the Israeli High Court of
Justice demanding that they be allowed to visit detainees have
been regularly rejected.  Of the 62 cases of interrogation taken by
Advocate Sahar Francis on behalf of Addameer during the year
2000, denial of legal counsel has been documented 62 times for an
average period of 20 to 30 days.

<p>General Prison Conditions<br>
The Israeli security forces have recently transferred all criminal
prisoners from Al Jalameh Prison to Hadarim Prison in order to
make enough room at Al Jalameh prison for Palestinain political
prisoners who have been and continue to be arrested since the
beginning of clashes.

<p>The general conditions in Israeli prisons as they relate to Palestinian
political prisoners are extremely bad.  The Israeli General 
Administration of
Prisons announced an emergency situation after the clashes began, 
claiming that
Palestinian prisoners may attempt actions in support of the uprising 
taking
place outside the prison walls.  One example of this is the isolation 
and
separation of sections from one another in 'Asqalan prison.  The same 
was done
at Shatta prison.  Frequent search raids in prisoner's cells have 
become common
practice.

<p>Cancellation of family visits and lawyer's permits<br>
Family visits to Palestinian prisoners have all been cancelled as a 
result of
the strict Israeli closure imposed on all Palestinian areas. This in 
itself
causes severe psychological trauma to both Palestinian prisoners and 
their
families, as family visits are their only way of contact to the outside 
world.
 Without these visits, prisoners have no way of knowing of the safety 
of family
members during these horrifying times. The cancellation of family 
visits also
limits the amount of food and necessary supplies available to prisoners 
as
families are the main source supplying the prisoners' needs.

<p>It is important to note that all Palestinian prisoners are being held 
in
Israeli prisons inside 1948 Palestinian areas. The imprisonment of 
Palestinian
prisoners in prisons located within 1948 Palestinian areas is in 
absolute
contravention of international conventions that stipulate that an 
occupying
power is forbidden to move civilians from the territories it is 
occupying to
its territory.

<p>Families of Palestinian prisoners normally need to obtain special
permit by the Israeli authorities in order to be able to travel to the
prisons.  The placing of the strict closure by Israel automatically
cancels these permits, unilaterally preventing family visits.
Families will have to go through the very long and humiliating
procedure of obtaining new permits if the closure is lifted.  If they
are able to apply for the permits, it will take a long period of time
before they actually receive the permits.  In addition, Palestinian
lawyers are also now prohibited from visiting prisoners and following
up on cases as all lawyers' permits have been cancelled.<a href="#top">return to top</a>
