 </p>
  <p>The 
    Israeli occupation authorities have continued to impose a total siege on the 
    occupied Palestinian territories, including the areas under the control of 
    the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, for 
    the 112<sup>th</sup> consecutive day.&nbsp; In actions of escalation, the 
    Israeli occupation forces tigtened the siege imposed on the occupied Palestinian 
    territories.&nbsp; On December 30, 2000, the Israeli occupation forces closed 
    Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt, and on January 1, 2001, these forces closed 
    Gaza International Airport and Al-Karama Crossing with Jordan.&nbsp; They 
    also closed Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet and Beit Hanoun (Erez) Crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The Israeli occupation forces have also imposed an internal siege on the Palestinian 
    cities in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; These forces have closed the two main roads 
    between governates of the Gaza Strip (Salah El-Din Street and the coastal 
    road, which has been closed for the first time) and all alternative branch 
    roads, isolating the Gaza Strip and cutting it into three separated areas.</p>
  <p>Under 
    such measures taken by the Israeli occupation forces, the social and economic 
    conditions in the Gaza Strip deteriorate, causing disastrous impacts on Palestinian 
    citizens in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; PCHR’s field officers reported that the 
    Israeli occupation forces have allowed the passage of Palestinian citizens 
    through military roadblocks since Friday, January 5, 2001, but according to 
    a specific timetable, 9-11 and 15-17 local time, and under severe conditions 
    and hard suffering as it was the case in the past.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> </p>
  <p>In its 31<sup>st</sup> Closure Update, PCHR continues 
    to survey the impacts of the continued total siege imposed on the Gaza Strip 
    on the social and economic conditions in the Strip. </p>

    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Closing Crossings and Further Deterioration of the Economic Conditions</p>
  <p>At the 
    beginning of the new year, the Israeli occupation Authorities toghtened its 
    siege on the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; On December 30, 2000, the Israeli occupation 
    forces closed Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt, and on January 1, 2001, these 
    forces closed Gaza International Airport.&nbsp; At the same time, these forces 
    closed Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet and Beit Hanoun (Erez) Crossing.&nbsp; In 
    addition, Sofa Crossing, through which construction raw materials necessary 
    for infrastructure projects in the Gaza Strip are entered into the Gaza Strip, 
    has been closed for more than three months.&nbsp; Under such measures taken 
    by the Israeli occupation forces, the economic situation in the Gaza Strip 
    deteriorates, causing disastrous impacts on all aspects of life in the Gaza 
    Strip.</p>
  <p>The 
    total siege imposed on the Gaza Strip has stopped all commercial transactions 
    of the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; About 80% of these commercial transactions are with 
    Israel and 20% are with the West Bank and foreign markets.&nbsp; It is worth 
    mentioning that Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet has been devoted to commercial transactions 
    of the Gaza Strip even at times of total closures imposed by Israel on the 
    occupied Palestinian territories.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this Outlet has been 
    closed several times since imposing the current total siege.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> 
  </p>
  <p>The 
    Palestinian agricultural sector is the most vulnerable sector under the current 
    total siege, as Palestinian farmers could not reach their agricultural land 
    to cultivate their agricultural products and selling them in local markets, 
    because of the strict siege which isolated Palestinian cities and villages 
    from one another.&nbsp; As a result, local markets suffered a shortage of 
    these products, and the prices of such products increased.</p>
  <p>On the 
    other hand, under the current siege, the export of agricultural products from 
    the Gaza Strip into markets of the West Bank and Israeli, Arab and foreign 
    markets has stopped, causing the spoil of these products, and consequently 
    large losses to Palestinian farmers.&nbsp; These farmers also suffered more 
    losses because of sweeping and destruction of their agricultural land carried 
    out daily by the Israeli occupation forces.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
  <p>The 
    Palestinian transportation sector also suffered large losses due to the internal 
    and external siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; The Israeli occupation 
    forces have prevented the movement of transportation between Palestinian cities 
    in the Gaza Strip and between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.&nbsp; In addition, 
    Palestinian trucks cannot transport goods, because all crossings and outlets, 
    especially Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, have been closed.&nbsp; It is worth mentioning 
    that Palestinians who work in the transportation sector constitute 4.8% of 
    the total Palestinian labor force in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Denying the Access of Palestinian Laborers to Their Work Places</p>
  <p>As the 
    Israeli occupation forces tightened the total siege and re-closed all crossings, 
    Palestinian laborers from the Gaza Strip cannot reach their work places inside 
    the Gaza Strip and in Israel.&nbsp; The number of Palestinian laborers from 
    the Gaza Strip who regularly used to work in Israel before imposing the current 
    total siege on the occupied Palestinian territories by the Israeli occupation 
    forces was 24,000, and about 48,000 laborers used to work on a non-organized 
    basis.&nbsp; It is worth mentioning that in the middle of December, the Israeli 
    occupation authorities allowed 5,600 laborers from the Gaza Strip to reach 
    their work places in Israel, but under strict conditions, including:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;
text-kashida:0%;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    §&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The age of a Palestinian laborer 
    must be over 37.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;
text-kashida:0%;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    §&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    His security record, according 
    to the standards of the Israeli occupation forces, must be clean.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;
text-kashida:0%;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    §&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    His Israeli employer must request 
    him.</p>
  <p>Not 
    all of this limited number of Palestinian laborers from the Gaza Strip could 
    reach their work places, because of arbitrary measures taken by the Israeli 
    occupation forces.&nbsp; These laborers had to undergo complicated and humiliating 
    checking procedures at which the Israeli occupation forces used police dogs 
    in the process of personal checking.&nbsp; In addition, these laborers had 
    to cross military roadblocks of the Israeli occupation forces at which they 
    were provoked by soldiers.&nbsp; As a result, Palestinian laborers had no 
    choice except to protest against these measures.&nbsp; On December 19, 2000, 
    the Israeli occupation forces faced these protests with opening fire on Palestinian 
    laborers, wounding some of these laborers with live ammunition, and on December 
    20, 2000, six Palestinian laborers were wounded with live bullets fired by 
    the Israeli occupation forces.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Furthermore, 
    the Israeli occupation forces denied the access of Palestinian laborers to 
    their work places in the industrial zone in Beit Hanoun in the north of the 
    Gaza Strip, and declared it a closed military area.&nbsp; It is worth mentioning 
    that about 4,000 Palestinian laborers work in factories of the industrial 
    zone.</p>
  <p>As a 
    result of the internal siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on Palestinian 
    cities and villages in the Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinian laborers working 
    inside the Gaza Strip have not been able to reach their work places, so many 
    Palestinian factories and ateliers have stopped their work.&nbsp; In addition, 
    Palestinian employees at governmental institutions and ministries have not 
    been able to reach their work places, which decreases the services offered 
    to Palestinian citizens by these institutions and ministries.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In this 
    context, it is worth mentioning that the Palestinian economy mainly depends 
    on the income of Palestinian labor force in Israel.&nbsp; Given that the average 
    daily income of a Palestinian laborer in Israel is approximately US$ 27.50, 
    then the daily loss of organized Palestinian laborers from the Gaza Strip 
    in Israel is US$ 660,000, as the number of these laborers is estimated at 
    24,000.&nbsp; If we add the income of non-organized Palestinian laborers in 
    Israel, laborers in the industrial zone and laborers at local factories and 
    ateliers, then the total loss will be more than US$ 2 million daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Further Deterioration of Health Conditions</p>
  <p>The 
    health situation in the Gaza Strip has not witnessed any improvement despite 
    the large amounts of medical assistance the Palestinian Ministry of Health 
    has received from Arab and friend countries, as the siege imposed by the Israeli 
    occupation forces has stood as a major obstacle in the face of providing Palestinian 
    citizens with medical services.&nbsp; The recent strict internal siege which 
    cuts Palestinian areas in the Gaza Strip has caused further deterioration 
    of health conditions in the Gaza Strip, especially in the middle area, whose 
    citizens have to go to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis or Shifa’ hospital in 
    Gaza City.&nbsp; In this case, they have to cross military roadblocks of the 
    Israeli occupation forces, which seems impossible under the current measures 
    taken by these forces which restrict the movement of Palestinian citizens 
    between areas of the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; Following are examples of the impacts 
    of the recent strict internal siege imposed on Palestinian cities and villages 
    in the Gaza Strip on medical services:</p>

    On Tuesday, January 2, 2001, Israeli occupation forces positioned 
    near Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction, to the south of Gaza City, prevented 
    the passage of a Palestinian ambulance in which a pregnant woman was transferred 
    from a clinic in Dier El-Balah and going to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City.&nbsp; 
    PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that Mrs. Mariam A’amer El-Akhras, 
    30 years old, from the refugee camp of Al-Boreij, was in serious health condition 
    and deadly in need for a Caesarian operation that could not be performed in 
    the middle area due to the lack of necessary medical equipment in nearby local 
    clinics.</p>

    On the same day, the same forces also prevented the passage 
    of a Palestinian ambulance which transported Rajab El-Sa’afin, 70 years old, 
    and Safeya El-Kurd, 70 years old, from Deir El-Balah, who were in need for 
    medical care at Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City.&nbsp; PCHR’s field officer in 
    the area reported that these forces forced the ambulance to travel back to 
    the middle area, preventing its passage to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City.</p>

    Restrictions on Internal Movement – Three Collective Jails for Residents 
    of the Gaza Strip</p>
  <p>Since 
    Tuesday morning, January 2, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces have tightened 
    its siege on the Gaza Strip, when they closed the coastal road between the 
    middle area and Gaza City, and re-closed Salah El-Din Street (the main road 
    between the north and south of the Gaza Strip).&nbsp; These forces also closed 
    all alternative branch roads which Palestinian citizens usually resort to 
    in cases of closing the main roads.&nbsp; As a result, the Gaza Strip has 
    been cut into three completely separated areas: Rafah and Khan Yunis; the 
    middle area; and Gaza City and the northern area.&nbsp; Under such recent 
    measures taken by the Israeli occupation forces, more than 1 million residents 
    of the Gaza Strip have been living in three collective jails, in a violation 
    to basic human rights, as they have not been able to move between areas of 
    the Gaza Strip, in addition to not being able to move inside the areas where 
    they live in the evening.&nbsp; In addition, pupils and students, whose schools 
    are at points of friction with the Israeli occupation forces or who have to 
    cross military roadblocks of these forces, such as Al-Tuffah roadblock in 
    Khan Yunis, Tal Al-Sultan roadblock in Rafah, Kfar Darom roadblock in Deir 
    El-balah and the roadblock at Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction, have not been 
    able to attend classes at their schools.&nbsp; Palestinian farmers also have 
    not been able to reach their agricultural land to cultivate their agricultural.&nbsp; 
    In addition, employees of governmental institutions have not been able to 
    reach their work places in Gaza City, which has interrupted providing social, 
    educational and health services to Palestinian citizens.&nbsp; In this context, 
    it is worth mentioning that UNRWA could get permission by the Israeli occupation 
    authorities, after hard efforts, which ensures free movement of its employees, 
    especially administrative officials and service workers, so it became the 
    second party that could get such permission after ICRC.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday, January 2, 2001, the Israeli occupation 
    authorities canceled the privileges offered to VIP’s of the Palestinian National 
    Authority. </p>

    A Shortage of Foodstuffs and a Significant Increase of Prices of Goods</p>
  <p>Under 
    the external siege imposed on the occupied Palestinian territories and the 
    internal siege imposed on Palestinian cities and villages by the Israeli occupation 
    forces, residents of Gaza City suffer a shortage of some basic foodstuffs, 
    such as vegetables, fruits and meat.&nbsp; Farmers of the southern and middle 
    areas of the Gaza Strip have not been able to reach markets of Gaza City to 
    sell their agricultural products.&nbsp; As a result, prices of some goods 
    have significantly increased.&nbsp; For example, the price of a kilogram of 
    parsley has become 8 NIS after it was 4 NIS before imposing the current siege, 
    the price of a kilogram of peppers has become 12 NIS after it was 6 NIS, and 
    the price of chicken has become 10 NIS after it was 7 NIS.&nbsp; As the Israeli 
    occupation forces continues to impose a total siege on the occupied Palestinian 
    territories, suffering of the Palestinian people is expected to increase and 
    their economic conditions are expected to deteriorate.&nbsp; In this regard, 
    on Wednesday, January 3, 2001, the high emergency committee of Palestinian 
    NGO’s could not provide Palestinian citizens with assistance offered by the 
    Saudi committee to assist the Palestinian Intifada, which included 25,000 
    packages of foodstuffs.</p>

    Continued Deprivation of the Right of Education</p>
  <p>As a 
    result of cutting the Gaza Strip into completely separated areas, thousands 
    of Palestinian pupils and students have not been able to attend classes at 
    their schools and teachers have not been able to reach these schools.&nbsp; 
    Also, thousands of university and college students have not been able to attend 
    classes at their universities and colleges, in a violation of their right 
    of education.&nbsp; In addition, hundreds of university and college professors 
    and staffs have not been able to reach their work places.&nbsp; As a result, 
    the educational process at universities of the Gaza Strip has completely stopped.&nbsp; 
    It is worth mentioning that 50% of the total number of students and 60% of 
    the total number of professors at Palestinian universities in the Gaza Strip, 
    most of which are in Gaza City, are from the southern area of the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; 
    The most serious problem of this issue is that January is the month at which 
    most universities were scheduled to conduct final exams of the first semester.&nbsp; 
    So, students have to attend classes at their university in order to be able 
    to do well at these exams, and it might be impossible to conduct such exams 
    under such circumstances.</p>
  <p>On the 
    other hand, since the current siege was imposed on the occupied Palestinian 
    territories by the Israeli occupation forces, Gazan students have not been 
    able to attend classes at their universities in the West Bank, in a violation 
    of their right of education.&nbsp; Additionally, Gazan students who have been 
    in the West Bank have not been able to visit their families in the Gaza Strip.

    Continued Prevention of Visit to Palestinian Prisoners in Israeli Jails</p>
  <p>Residents 
    of the Gaza Strip are still deprived of visiting their sons detained in Israeli 
    jails, due the current total siege imposed on the occupied Palestinian territories 
    since September 29, 2000.&nbsp; Lawyers from the Gaza Strip also have not 
    been able to visit Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.&nbsp; These prisoners 
    receive an inhumane treatment by the Israeli occupation forces.&nbsp; In this 
    context, it is worth mentioning that the Israeli occupation forces are still 
    detaining more than 1,600 Palestinians, including about 300 from the Gaza 
    Strip, in Israeli jails.</p>
  <p>According to the Palestinian Ministry of Prisoners, 
    the number of Palestinian prisoners from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
    in Israeli jails up to December 18, 2000 was 2,014.</p>

    Preventing Residents of the Gaza Strip from Travelling Abroad</p>
  <p>In addition 
    to the above restrictions imposed on the movement of Palestinian laborers, 
    farmers, farmers, employees, students and families of prisoners, the Israeli 
    occupation forces have tightened its siege on the Gaza Strip by closing Rafah 
    Border Crossing on December 30, 2000, and Gaza International Airport on January 
    1, 2001.&nbsp; Under such closure, the Israeli occupation forces have completely 
    prevented residents of the Gaza Strip from traveling abroad.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The 
    Israeli occupation forces have also continued to prevent the movement of Palestinians 
    between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip through the Israeli territories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Preventing the Entry of Palestinian Newspapers into the Gaza Strip</p>

    any means by which they can violate human right of the Palestinian people. 
    On January 3, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces prevented the entry Palestinian 
    newspapers published in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, into the Gaza 
    Strip.&nbsp; The major daily newspapers, Al-Quds, Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda, 
    are published in Jerusalem and Ramallah.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p>It seems 
    that lifting the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip by the Israeli occupation 
    forces is not expected in the near future.&nbsp; Gaza Strip has become like 
    three isolated collective jails.&nbsp; All its outlets to outside world are 
    closed, the living conditions of its residents are deteriorating and its production 
    sectors, especially agriculture, have stopped.</p>
  <p>PCHR 
    reiterates its calls to lift the total siege imposed on the occupied Palestinian 
    territories and to stop all measures of collective punishment taken by the 
    Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian people, in a violation of 
    internationally accepted human rights standards and the international law, 
    especially the Fourth Geneva Convention.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>PCHR calls for lifting the total siege imposed on the 
    occupied Palestinian territories and putting an end to the policy of starving 
    adopted by the Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian people.</p>
  <p>PCHR 
    calls upon international organizations and agencies to exert pressure on the 
    Israeli occupation government to release 3 million Palestinians whom it unjustifiably 
    detains as hostages.&nbsp; The current situation in the occupied Palestinian 
    territories is the most disastrous since they were occupied by the Israeli 
    occupation forces on June 5, 1967.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>PCHR reiterates its call upon the international community 
    to immediately intervene to put an end to the violations of human rights in 
    the occupied Palestinian territories by the Israeli occupation forces, and 
    to ensure Israel’s compliance to international conventions through:</p>

  <p class=MsoBodyText dir=LTR style='text-align:justify;
text-kashida:0%;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
