<h3>Palestine Monitor</h3>
<p><b>
The state of closure in Gaza: An eyewitness account
  </b></p>

<p>February 19th


<p>
On February 14, the Palestinian Monitor team went to investigate 
the
latest state of closure in the Gaza Strip. Due to shelling that
morning and following what appears to be the intentional killing of
Israeli soldiers by a Gazan bus driver near Tel Aviv, the team was 
not
able to travel to the Northern part of the Strip. However, the team
was able to visit Gaza city and Khan Younis, in the Southern part of
the Strip, albeit having to wait more than 15 minutes at Israeli
checkpoints guarded by heavily armed tanks between the two 
areas.
<p>
While the internal and external closure imposed on the Gaza Strip
since the beginning of the Intifada has been reported to a limited
extent in the international media, nothing can compare to the effect
of witnessing the closure and some of its ramifications upon the
Palestinian population first hand.  In early January, the Israeli army
divided the Strip into four parts, thus precluding the internal
movement of people and goods in the --- km-long area.  Access to
Israel and Egypt has been denied to Palestinians since the outbreak of
the popular uprising.
<p>
The journey between Gaza city and Khan Younis took at least twice as
much time as it would under normal circumstances. The two areas are
separated by cement blocks aimed at isolating Israeli settlements,
which cover 40% of the Gaza Strip, from Palestinian-inhabited areas. 
Settlers can freely access their homes while Palestinians have to
travel on a parallel road guarded by Israeli tanks. Not all
Palestinians can travel from one area of the Strip to the other and
many are in fact, turned back by the Israeli army when trying to reach
their place of work, land, schools or universities.
<p>
On February 15, the Palestine Monitor team witnessed instances of
Palestinian being pulled out of their cars by Israeli soldiers at
checkpoints. They were left on the side of the road with their hands
behind their heads and under the supervision of soldiers well
protected in a tank. The team noted that the people in question were
not armed. In the meantime, a dozen cars were waiting in line to see
whether they would be allowed into Khan Younis. Israeli settlers were
driving freely on the other side of the road separated by 4-feet high
cement blocks. The team was told by Palestinian witnesses that the
15-minute wait we experienced while trying to enter Khan Younis was
very short compared to the lengthy delays they are regularly forced to
endure.  During the afternoon rush hour, a two-kilometre-long queue of
cars has come to be expected. Palestinians often have to wait hours to
see whether they will be allowed back into or out of Gaza City to be
able to return to their homes.

<p> Israeli army fires highly toxic quantities of tear gas at
civilians in Khan Younis, Gaza, 2/15/2001
<p>
On February 12, Israeli tanks and helicopters fired gas bombs at
houses in the Gharbi Refugee Camp, adjacent to the Tuffah crossing in
the Gaza Strip. According to hospital sources, 32 people who were
exposed to the gas were treated for serious injuries. Although to
date, no evidence supports the possibility that the gas fired was any
different that tear gas normally used by the Israeli army, the
patients’ symptoms, how the gas was fired and the way it was fired,
indicates that it was used in highly concentrated quantities and in an
enclosed space.
<p>
On February 14, the Palestine Monitor visited the Al-Nasser hospital
in Khan Younis where the 32 cases were admitted following the gas
attack. Numerous of these patients were experiencing convulsions and
violent seizures. Other patients were unconscious, and others were
experiencing severe breathing difficulties. The doctors responsible
for the ward explained that they had not been able to determine the
nature of the gas inhaled by the patients and therefore had not found
a satisfactory treatment for the symptoms of these particular
patients. For now, doctors are administering strong sedative and
anti-inflammatory drugs and some patients are on oxygen.
<p>
At least another dozen women and children have been admitted to
clinics in Khan Younis and are reported to experience the same
symptoms.
<p>
The Gharbi refugee camp is located near the Tuffah crossing that
separates it from the Neve Dekalim settlement (part of the Gush Katif
settlement bloc). The Israeli army has shelled the camp constantly
since the beginning of the Intifada and the scene is one of absolute
desolation, reminiscent of the infamous images of Beirut during the
Israeli invasion and civil war. The facades of many buildings are
disfigured by deep, wide rocket and bullet holes and sand bags are
packed at the rear entrance of the camp, which has been cut off from
nearby Palestinian farming areas by Israeli tanks protecting the
settlement. The Tuffah crossing has been renamed the Suhada (martyrs)
crossing by the area's residents.
<p>
One woman described the February 12 gas attack. Shells hit the houses,
which shortly after filled with a thick dark smoke that later left a
black deposit on her body and everything inside the house. The smoke
turned orange (a description confirmed by testimonies at the Al-Nasser
hospital) and her livestock immediately died.
<p>
More men than women were injured in this gas attack on the camp
because many women and children had already been sent to safer places
due to the constant Israeli military attacks on this area. The
Palestinian Ministry of Health has collected samples of the empty gas
shells and is currently investigating this attack.

<p> Destruction of Property

For four months, the Gaza Strip has been effectively isolated from the
world. Over 1 million Palestinians are caged in an area of not more
than 365km2. Forty-percent of this land is off limits to Palestinians
due to the 16 Israeli settlements housing 4,500 settlers and numerous
military outposts that occupy it.
<p>
The situation in Gaza is dreadful, and worsening by degrees. To halt
Palestinian movement in the Strip, the Israeli military has cut Gaza
into four sections by erecting road blockades and checkpoints
throughout the strip. Israeli tanks line the roadsides, ostensively
for the protection of the settlements and settlers and the roads they
travel upon.
<p>
Furthermore, the Israeli army has taken control of Palestinian
farmland and orchards that lie alongside roads that are used by
settlers, and land that surrounds military bases and settlements.
Using “security needs” as a pretext for its control of the land, the
Israeli military has also destroyed everything on the land.
<p>
The depth of this destruction needs to be seen to be believed. All
vegetation including olive and citrus trees, banana plants, mango
groves, agricultural sheds, vegetable greenhouses, and palm trees
along the roadside from Gaza City to Khan Younis has been decimated.
Bulldozer tracks indented in the sand crisscross the land; mounds of
sand are dotted around, each covering the remains of uprooted trees
and broken branches and the remains of orchards are strewn along the
roadside.
<p>
The destruction of Palestinian homes and the ramshackle sand bag
fortifications along the streets is equally shocking. Uninhabitable
shells of apartment blocks are a common sight. Any houses that lie
near Israeli settlements and military posts have been under constant
bombardment by Israeli tanks and heavy weaponry.
<p>
The Israeli destruction of Palestinian agriculture and housing has
ruined the livelihoods of the people and has rendered many homeless.
This outright destruction and collective punishment continues unabated
until this day.
