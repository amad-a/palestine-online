<p><b>
The Impact on the Palestinian Economy of Confrontations, 
Mobility Restrictions and Border Closures,
  </b></p>


<p> 
28 September-26 November 2000 

<p>
I. Introduction 
<p>
The months of October and November have witnessed the most severe 
crisis in Israeli-Palestinian relations since the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles in September 1993. Confrontations have 
resulted in the death or injury of thousands of Palestinians-and 
numerous Israelis-as well as damage to Palestinian infrastructure, 
buildings, agricultural property and vehicles. There have also been 
serious disruptions in normal economic activities caused by the 
political strife and the imposition of movement restrictions around 
and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
<p>
For most of this period personal mobility between the West Bank and 
Gaza, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the rest of 
the world, has been severely impeded. Travel for Palestinians between 
the West Bank and Gaza via the "safe passage" route has been blocked 
by the Israeli authorities since 6 October while the Gaza 
International Airport and the border crossings at Rafah and the 
Allenby/Karameh Bridge have been closed for extended periods. 1/ 
Palestinian foreign trade has also been affected. Imports and exports 
transshipped through Israeli ports have been delayed or blocked 
completely for most of this period while the commercial crossings at 
Rafah and the the Allenby/Karameh Bridge have been closed for about 70 
per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, of the days during the 
reporting period. 2/ 
<p>
Furthermore, there have been varying levels of restrictions on 
mobility between cities, towns and villages in both the West Bank and 
Gaza due to reduced levels of security on roads and the imposition of 
internal closures by the Israeli authorities. Such measures have 
routinely included the placement of physical barriers between 
Palestinian villages and cities and the deployment of military 
checkpoints on main roads. 3/ In addition, the Israeli authorities 
have imposed curfews on several areas in the West Bank, most notably 
in the city of Hebron and on numerous villages in the Nablus area. 

<p>Private economic losses during the first three weeks of the crisis 
were estimated at approximately USD 186.2 million. 4/ Lost 
income-earning opportunities were estimated at about half of the value 
of domestic production and nearly all of the income earned by 
Palestinians working in Israel. Since then the economic losses have 
been compounded, while the loss of life, injuries and the physical 
destruction of private and public property have become more 
widespread. This is an updated and expanded report on the economic 
and social impact of the crisis covering the two-month period 28 
September-26 November 2000.
