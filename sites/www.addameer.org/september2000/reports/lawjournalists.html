<h3>LAW</h3>
<h3>Attacking Journalists: Israeli forces violate Palestinian right to freedom 
  of expression</h3>




<p>February 19, 2001 
<p>The journalists working in the Palestinian territories 
  do not escape the brutality of the military occupation to which the Palestinian 
  people and their institutions have been subjected for many years. Local and 
  foreign journalists alike are vulnerable to attack by Israeli soldiers or settlers, 
  particularly since the outbreak of the current crisis in September 2000. <p>Until 
  the date of this report, Israeli forces have gravely violated all principles 
  of international humanitarian law and international conventions relating to 
  the protection of civilians in time of war. Israeli soldiers and militant settlers 
  have carried out frequent attacks on journalists and reporters working for newspapers 
  and television stations, as well as field researchers for the human rights organisations 
  operating in the Palestinian territories.<p> LAW Society’s documentation indicates 
  that 39 journalists and reporters have been injured by Israeli soldiers and 
  settlers, with injuries ranging from wounds incurred by live bullets and shrapnel 
  to assault. 32 of these are Palestinian journalists or reporters and 7 are foreign 
  reporters working in the Palestinian territories. In addition, four field researchers 
  for Palestinian human rights organisations have also been injured.<p> According 
  to LAW’s information, Israeli forces have deliberately caused harm to teams 
  of journalists, including subjecting them to severe beatings and a barrage of 
  gunshots from close range. Journalists have had their equipment confiscated 
  and been chased, even though their equipment and vehicles were clearly marked 
  ‘PRESS’ and they carried press cards. Threats to life and security of person 
  Journalists Adel Abu Ni’ma (Reuters and Al Ayyam), Fat’he Barahma (The Voice 
  of Palestine) and Imad Abu Sumbul (France Press and Al Hayat Al Jadida newspaper), 
  were shot at with machinegun fire by soldiers stationed at the ‘Virdari’ settlement 
  near Jericho and the Israeli military outpost at the entrance to the city. The 
  journalists, whose car was clearly-marked, were on their way to Al Jadid Hospital 
  in Jericho to cover the clashes on 28 October 2000. <p>Khalid Zaghari, a photographer 
  for Al Quds daily newspaper, stated to LAW, “I went to photograph the Friday 
  noon prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque on 29 September 2000. Immediately after the prayer, 
  clashes broke out, so I started taking more photographs. Suddenly I saw Israeli 
  soldiers approaching me; they hit me with batons on my shoulders and hands, 
  which I had raised to cover my head. While they were beating me, they shot at 
  me from a distance of less than one metre, hitting me in the leg with a rubber-coated 
  steel bullet. I was taken to Hadasa hospital, but I lost my camera and the pictures 
  I had taken. That was the twentieth time in seven years that Israeli soldiers 
  have attacked me. I have been hit by live and rubber coated steel bullets, and 
  I have also been beaten several times.” <p>Ata Awisat, a freelance photojournalist 
  from Jerusalem’s Jabal Al Mukabir was severely injured in the head and face 
  and his body was bruised when special Israeli forces disguised as Arabs (known 
  as ‘Musta’ribeen’) attacked him in Jerusalem on 4 October during clashes after 
  the funeral of Mohammad Al Sarkhi. Awisat described the incident to LAW as follows 
  “On 4 October 2000, I was in Jerusalem with a group of journalists, mostly Israelis. 
  A group of ‘Musta’ribeen’ suddenly started attacking and arresting people, so 
  I began taking photos. Seven of them attacked and hit me. They got me on the 
  ground and stepped on me. They tried to confiscate my cameras but I wouldn’t 
  let go. Then they tried to pull me up so they could get the camera I had around 
  my neck. A border guard officer came and grabbed my neck, and one of the ‘Musta’ribeen’ 
  stamped in my stomach. Then they noticed that there were other photographers 
  present so they left me and took off quickly. I passed out and woke up later 
  at the hospital.” Awisat added: “They treat Israeli journalists much better. 
  One photographer took a picture of me on the ground being beaten by six ‘Musta’ribeen’. 
  I had photographed two ‘Musta’ribeen’ while one was holding a gun and the other 
  choking a child; perhaps that was what provoked them to attack me.” He went 
  on: “That was the third time I have been attacked during this Intifada. The 
  first time was during the massacre on 29 September 2000 and the second was in 
  Shu’fat when the Israeli police attacked me while I was taking photographs. 
  I hold the Israeli authorities accountable for any future threats to my security, 
  because I feel that the Israeli police are filled with hatred and do not handle 
  these matters correctly. The Israeli police spokesman said today that I had 
  been standing between protesters, which means that tomorrow if I was “between 
  protesters” that might justify their killing me. Now the Israeli forces and 
  police are settling accounts with all journalists, especially since the filming 
  of the murder of Mohammed Al Durra in Gaza.” <p>34 year-old photojournalist Hazim 
  Bader from Hebron, who works for Associated Press, told LAW: “On 29 September 
  2000, I was at Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Israeli soldiers opened fire at 
  Palestinian worshippers and clashes broke out that went on for almost twenty 
  minutes. I tried to take some photos, but then I saw Israeli soldiers pointing 
  their guns at me. I was hit by a bullet in my right hand, the one holding the 
  camera. I was taken to Hadasa hospital for surgery.” <p>30 year-old Nasser Ishtaya 
  from Salem/ Nablus, who works for Associated Press in Jerusalem, stated to LAW: 
  “At 8:30 pm on 13 November 2000, I was on my way home along with Abdul Rahman 
  Al Kusini, a reporter for Reuters. Our yellow-plated (Israeli-licensed) taxi, 
  driven by Usama Bazbaz, was attacked by about 30 Israeli settlers on the road 
  near the Israeli Za’tara military outpost. While Israeli soldiers were watching, 
  they threw large rocks at us and managed to destroy the car, even though it 
  was clearly marked ‘Press’. We were bruised. We escaped to the nearby Palestinian 
  village of Beta where we received first aid before being taken to Rafidia hospital 
  in Nablus.” Ishtaya added: “That was not the first time I was attacked. On 11 
  October, while I was driving my car at the northern entrance to Al Bireh, Israeli 
  soldiers fired at me with a machinegun. They destroyed my car. I managed to 
  escape and was rescued by a Red Crescent ambulance.” 39 year-old photographer 
  Mazin Da’na from Hebron, who works for Reuters, stated to LAW: “On October 2 
  I was at Bab Al Zawyi in Hebron with a group of other photographers. I felt 
  a sharp blow on the neck and then a bullet in my left foot. I received treatment 
  at the nearby Red Crescent Society field hospital and then I was admitted to 
  Alia hospital where I underwent surgery on my foot. That was not the first time 
  I have been attacked; I was hit by a rubber-coated steel bullet on 1 October 
  and settlers attacked me on 2 October, the same day I got shot.”<p> 27 year-old 
  Mohammad Al Ashkar from Tulkarem is a cameraman for ‘Al Salam’ television. He 
  told LAW the following: “On Friday 24 November, there was a massive protest 
  in south-west Tulkarem. I was covering the protest while wearing a bullet-proof 
  vest and a hat with the word ‘Press’ written on it. I was also carrying a camera. 
  When the clashes started, a man was shot twice in the leg and fell to the ground 
  - his name was Hashim Abu Samaha. I started filming him from a distance of only 
  three metres; we were 15 metres away from the Israeli soldiers. Suddenly I was 
  hit in the heel by an unknown type of bullet. I held my camera up so the soldiers 
  would realise I was a journalist, but then I heard another shot. An ambulance 
  took me to Tulkarem hospital. I am positive that I was intentionally shot by 
  the soldiers, who were very close by.” <p>At 1:00 pm on Sunday 28 January 2001, 
  the ‘Watan’ television news crew was apprehended at a checkpoint near Ein Keenya, 
  west of Ramallah. According to LAW’s documentation, the crew, including Duha 
  al Shami (22) and Ashraf Kutkut, was held at the Israeli checkpoint, although 
  they all had valid press cards. An Israeli soldier hit Al Shami, confiscated 
  her video cassettes and handed Kutkut an order to see the Israeli intelligence 
  department in Hebron. Finally, the crew was released, and the next day they 
  retrieved their cameras and video cassettes after they had been inspected by 
  the Israeli authorities.” <p>These are not the only Palestinian journalists attacked 
  by Israeli forces and settlers during the current crisis. LAW has documentation 
  indicating that the following journalists and photographers were also injured:

  transmission stations of the Palestine TV and Radio stations in Ramallah.<p> Israeli 
  forces also bombed the Palestinian Radio 2 station in Gaza on November 21. On

  and several spotlights. They also bombarded the premises of ‘Al Salam’ and ‘Al 
  Fajir Al Jadeed’ television stations in Tulkarem, causing severe damage. The 
  attacks were in October and November 2000. Israel cancels Palestinian press 
  cards The Israeli press office, controlled by the Israeli Prime Minister’s office, 
  issued an order to cancel the press cards used by Palestinian journalists working 
  for press centres in PNA controlled areas or occupied Jerusalem. The order meant 
  that Palestinian journalists could no longer cover stories in areas under Israeli 
  control, including occupied Jerusalem. The siege and the press The tight military 
  siege over the West Bank and Gaza Strip has prevented Palestinian newspapers 
  from reaching and being distributed in the Gaza Strip three times; most recently 
  since 15 February 2001. <b>Attacking Journalists: The legal context</b> 
<p>
Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
stipulates,
<p>
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers.”
<p>
Article 29 of the same Declarations states:
<p>
“Everyone has the duties to the community in which alone the free and
full development of his personality is possible. In the exercise of
his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such
limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of
securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of
others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order
and the general welfare in a democratic society.”
<p>
Articles 50 and 51 of the ‘Protocols Additional to the 1949 Geneva
Convention’ emphasise the protection of civilians in time of war
including journalists, since they are part of the civilian population:
<p>
“The civilian population comprises all persons who are civilians.”
“The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general
protection against dangers arising from military operations.”
<p>
Article 79 of the ‘Protocols Additional to the 1949 Geneva Convention’
stipulates:
<p>
“Journalists engaged in dangerous professional missions in areas of
armed conflict shall be considered as civilians within the meaning of
Article 50, paragraph 1. They shall be protected as such under the
Conventions and this Protocol, provided that they take no action
adversely affecting their status as civilians.”
<p>
LAW Society views the Israeli army’s measures against journalists as a
policy of silencing the press by terrorising journalists in order to
prevent them from documenting the crimes committed against  the
Palestinian people.

<p>LAW demands:

1.      The Israeli Government to immediately stop the use of
excessive and indiscriminate force and collective punishments against
Palestinian civilians.<p> 2.      The establishment of an international
investigation committee based on United Nations Security Council
resolutions 1322 of Oct 7, 2000, to investigate the violations of
international humanitarian law committed by the Israeli forces inside
the occupied Palestinian territories. <p>3.      The international
community to hold a conference for the High Contracting Parties of the
Fourth Geneva Convention in order to take practical measures to ensure
Israel's adherence to the convention. <p>4.      The international
community to pressurise Israel to immediately put an end to the
occupation of the Palestinian territories and effectively support the
implementation of the Palestinian right to self-determination. <p>5.     
Palestinian civilians to be placed under international protection.<p> 6. 
    The international journalists’ unions to take immediate measures
based on their responsibilities and based on the international
conventions relative to journalists rights in order to ensure Israel’s
adherence to such conventions and to stop attacking journalists in the
Palestinian territories.
