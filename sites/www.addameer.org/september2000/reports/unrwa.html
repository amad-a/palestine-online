Fifty-fifth General Assembly 
Plenary 
83rd Meeting (AM) 



<p>
Adopts 19 Texts Recommended by Fourth Committee on Atomic Radiation, 
Outer Space, Palestine Relief and Works Agency, Information, 
Decolonization 


<p>
Taking up a resolution on the work of Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People 
and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories, the Assembly adopted that 
text by a recorded vote of 91 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United 
States) with 61 abstentions. The text condemned the excessive use of 
force resulting in the last few weeks in more than 160 Palestinian 
deaths and thousands of injuries. (See Annex VII.) 
<p>
Adopting a text on the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the protection of civilian persons during time of war, the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Convention is applicable to the occupied 
Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, and other Arab territories 
occupied by Israel since 1967. It reiterated the need for speedy 
implementation of the recommendations contained in resolutions ES-10/3 
of 15 July 1997, ES-10/4 of 13 November 1997, ES-10/5 of 17 March 1998 
and ES-10/6 of 9 February 1999 with regard to ensuring respect by 
Israel for the Convention. That resolution was adopted by a recorded 
152 votes in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States) with 2 
abstentions (Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands). (See 
Annex VIII.) 
<p>
By a recorded vote of 152 in favour to 4 against (Federated States of 
Micronesia, Israel, Marshall Islands, United States) and no 
abstentions, the Assembly adopted a resolution reaffirming that 
Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory and the 
occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to peace and 
socio-economic development. The Assembly demanded complete cessation 
of the construction of the new settlement in Jabal Abu-Ghneim and of 
all Israeli settlement activities. (See Annex IX.) 
<p>
Adopting a text on Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory, including 
Jerusalem, the Assembly condemned all acts of violence, especially the 
excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians, resulting in 
injury and loss of human life. It called for the accelerated release 
of all arbitrarily detained or imprisoned Palestinians, and for 
complete respect of all fundamental freedoms of the Palestinian 
people. The recorded vote was 150 in favour to 3 against (Israel, 
Marshall Islands, United States) with 1 abstention (Federated States 
of Micronesia). (See Annex X.) 
<p>
In a resolution adopted by a recorded 150 votes in favour to 1 against 
(Israel) with 4 abstentions (Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall 
Islands, Nauru, United States), the Assembly called upon Israel to 
desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and identity cards on the 
Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan. It deplored the 
violations by Israel of the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilians in Time of War. (See Annex XI.) 
<p>
On the related issue of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the Assembly adopted a 
draft resolution on assistance to Palestine refugees by a recorded 
vote of 156 in favour to 1 against (Israel), with 3 abstentions 
(Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, United States). It 
reiterated its deep concern regarding the Agency's persisting critical 
financial situation and noted with profound concern that the 
continuing shortfall in the Agency's finances has a significant 
negative influence on the living conditions of the Palestine refugees 
most in need, with possible consequences for the Middle East peace 
process. (See Annex I.) 
<p>
By a further text the Assembly reaffirmed the right of all persons 
displaced as a result of the June 1967 and subsequent hostilities to 
return to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967. It endorsed, 
in the meanwhile, the efforts of the Agency's Commissioner-General to 
continue to provide emergency humanitarian assistance, as a temporary 
measure, to persons in the area who are currently displaced and in 
serious need of continued assistance, as a result of the June 1967 and 
subsequent hostilities. That text was adopted by a recorded vote of 
156 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States) with 2 abstentions 
(Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands). (See Annex V.) 
<p>
The Assembly adopted a text on operations of UNRWA, by a recorded vote 
of 157 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States) with 2 
abstentions (Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands). It 
called upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War, of 
12 August 1949, and to compensate the Agency for damages to its 
property and facilities resulting from actions by the Israeli side. It 
requested the Commissioner-General to proceed with the issuance of 
identification cards for Palestine refugees and their descendants in 
the occupied Palestinian territory. (See Annex IV.) 
<p>
A resolution on offers by Member States of grants and scholarships for 
higher education, including vocational training, for Palestine 
refugees strongly appealed to all States, specialized agencies and 
non-governmental organizations to augment their special allocations 
for grants and scholarships in addition to their contributions to 
UNRWA's regular budget. The recorded vote was 160 in favour to none 
against with 1 abstention (Israel). (See Annex III.) 
<p>
By a recorded vote of 156 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United 
States) with 2 abstentions (Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru), 
the Assembly adopted a text on the University of Jerusalem "Al Quds" 
for Palestine refugees. It emphasized the need to strengthen the 
educational system in the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel 
since 5 June 1967, including Jerusalem, and specifically the need for 
the establishment of the proposed university. The Assembly called once 
more upon Israel to remove the hindrances that it has put in the way 
of establishing the University of Jerusalem "Al Quds". (See Annex VI.) 
<p>
Without a vote, the Assembly adopted a resolution on the Working Group 
on the Financing of UNRWA and requested the Working Group to continue 
its efforts, in cooperation with the Secretary-General and the 
Commissioner-General, to find a solution to the Agency's financial 
situation.

<p>
UNRWA Drafts 
<p>
The Assembly also had before it seven draft resolutions on the work of 
UNRWA (document A/55/570). 
<p>
A text on assistance to Palestine refugees (document A/55/570-I) 
recommends that the General Assembly reiterate its deep concern 
regarding the Agency's persisting critical financial situation as 
outlined in the report of UNRWA's Commissioner-General. The Assembly 
would note with profound concern that the continuing shortfall in the 
Agency's finances has a significant negative influence on the living 
conditions of the Palestine refugees most in need, with possible 
consequences for the peace process. 
<p>
By other terms, the Assembly would note with regret that repatriation 
or compensation of the refugees, as provided for in its resolution 194 
(III), has not yet been effected, and also that the United Nations 
Conciliation Commission for Palestine has been unable to achieve 
progress in the matter. It would urge all Member States to expedite 
aid and assistance with a view to the economic and social development 
of the Palestinian people and the occupied territory. Further, the 
Assembly would note the significant success of the Agency's Peace 
Implementation Programme since the signing of the Declaration of 
Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, and stress the 
importance that contributions to this Programme not be at the expense 
of the General Fund. 
<p>
The draft resolution was approved by the Committee on 10 November by a 
recorded vote of 123 in favour to 1 against (Israel), with 1 
abstention (United States). 
<p>
A draft on the Working Group on the Financing of UNRWA (document 
A/55/570-II) 
recommends that the Assembly request the Working Group to continue its 
efforts, in cooperation with the Secretary-General and the 
Commissioner-General, to find a solution to the Agency's financial 
situation. It would welcome the new, unified budget structure for the 
2000-2001 biennium, which can contribute significantly to improved 
budgetary transparency. Also by that draft, the Assembly would request 
the Secretary-General to provide the necessary services and assistance 
to the Working Group for the conduct of its work. 
<p>
The Committee approved the draft text on 10 November without a vote. 
<p>
Under the provisions of a text on persons displaced as a result of the 
June 1967 and subsequent hostilities (document A/ 55/570-III), the 
Assembly would reaffirm the right of all persons displaced as a result 
of those hostilities to return to their homes or former places of 
residence in the territories occupied by Israel since 1967. It would 
endorse, in the meanwhile, the Commissioner-General's efforts to 
continue to provide emergency humanitarian assistance, as a temporary 
measure, to persons in the area who are currently displaced and in 
serious need of continued assistance as a result of the June 1967 and 
subsequent hostilities. 
<p>
The Committee approved the text on 10 November by a recorded vote of 
122 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no 
abstentions. 
<p>
By a draft on offers by Member States of grants and scholarships for 
higher education, including vocational training, for Palestine 
refugees (document A/55/570-IV) would have the Assembly strongly 
appeal to all States, specialized agencies and NGOs to augment the 
special allocations for grants and scholarships to Palestine refugees, 
in addition to their contributions to UNRWA's regular budget. It would 
also request the Agency to act as the recipient and trustee for those 
special allocations and to award them to qualified Palestine refugee 
candidates. Further, the Assembly would appeal to all States, 
specialized agencies and other international bodies to contribute 
generously towards the establishment of vocational training centres 
for Palestine refugees. 
<p>
The text was approved by the Committee on 10 November by a recorded 
vote of 123 in favour to none against, with 1 abstention (Israel). 
<p>
The General Assembly would, by a text on operations of UNRWA (document 
A/55/570-V), call upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of 
the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and to abide scrupulously by its 
provisions. It would call, once again, upon the Government of Israel 
to compensate the Agency for damages to its property and facilities 
resulting from actions by the Israeli side. It would request the 
Commissioner-General to proceed with the issuance of identification 
cards for Palestine refugees and their descendants in the occupied 
Palestinian territory. 
<p>
The text was approved by the Committee on 10 November by a recorded 
vote of 122 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no 
abstentions. 
<p>
According to a draft on Palestine refugees' properties and their 
revenues (document A/55/570-VI), the Assembly would reaffirm that the 
Palestine refugees are entitled to their property and to income 
derived therefrom, in conformity with the principles of justice and 
equity. The Assembly would urge the Palestinian and Israeli sides, as 
agreed between them, to deal with the important issue of the refugees' 
properties and their revenues in the framework of the final status 
negotiations of the Middle East peace process. 
<p>
The Committee approved the draft text on 10 November by a recorded 
vote of 122 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no 
abstentions. 
<p>
Under the provisions of a draft relating to the University of 
Jerusalem "Al Quds" for Palestine refugees (document A/55/570-VII), 
the General Assembly would emphasize the need to strengthen the 
educational system in the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel 
since 5 June 1967, including Jerusalem, and, specifically, the need 
for the establishment of the proposed university. The Assembly would, 
by further terms of the text, call once more upon Israel to remove the 
hindrances that it has put in the way of establishing the University 
of Jerusalem "Al Quds". 
<p>
The Committee approved the draft by recorded vote on 10 November by 
122 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no 
abstentions. 
<p>
Israeli Practices 
<p>
By a text on the work of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories (document A/55/571-I), the 
General Assembly would deplore those policies and practices of Israel 
which violate the human rights of the Palestinian people and other 
Arabs of the occupied territories. It would especially condemn the 
excessive use of force resulting in the last few weeks in more than 
160 Palestinian deaths and thousands of injuries. 
<p>
The draft text was approved by the Committee on 10 November by a 
recorded vote of 68 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States) 
with 53 abstentions. 
<p>
According to a draft on applicability of the Geneva Convention 
relative to the protection of civilian persons during time of war 
(document A/55/571-II), the Assembly would reaffirm that the 
Convention is applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory, 
including Jerusalem, and other Arab territories occupied by Israel 
since 1967. It would reiterate the need for speedy implementation of 
the recommendations contained in resolutions ES-10/3 of 15 July 1997, 
ES-10/4 of 13 November 1997, ES-10/5 of 17 March 1998 and ES-10/6 of 9 
February 1999 with regard to ensuring respect by Israel for the 
Convention. 
<p>
The Committee approved the draft on 10 November by a recorded vote of 
124 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no 
abstentions. 
<p>
Another draft, on Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian 
territory, including Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan 
(document A/ 55/571-III), would have the Assembly reaffirm that those 
settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace and socio-economic 
development. The Assembly would, by other terms, demand complete 
cessation of the construction of the new settlement in Jabal 
Abu-Ghneim and of all Israeli settlement activities. It would stress 
the need for full implementation of Security Council resolution 904 
(1994), which called upon Israel to implement measures aimed at 
preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers, and for 
measures to guarantee the safety and protection of Palestinian 
civilians. Further, the Assembly would reiterate its call for the 
prevention of those illegal acts of violence by the settlers, 
particularly in light of recent developments. 
<p>
The Committee approved the text on 10 November by a recorded vote of 
124 in favour to 2 against (Israel, United States), with no 
abstentions. 
<p>
By a text on Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory, including 
Jerusalem (document A/55/571-IV), the Assembly would condemn all acts 
of violence, especially the excessive use of force against Palestinian 
civilians, resulting in injury and loss of human life. The Assembly 
would, by other terms, call upon Israel to accelerate the release of 
all remaining Palestinians arbitrarily detained or imprisoned, and 
call for complete respect by Israel of all fundamental freedoms of the 
Palestinian people. Also, the Assembly would stress the need to 
preserve the territorial integrity of all the occupied Palestinian 
territory and to guarantee the freedom of movement of persons and 
goods within the Palestinian territory, into and from East Jerusalem, 
and to and from the outside world. 
<p>
The Committee approved the text by a recorded vote of 123 in favour to 
2 against (Israel, United States), with no abstentions. 
<p>
A draft on the occupied Syrian Golan (document A/55/571-V), recommends 
that the Assembly call upon Israel to desist from imposing Israeli 
citizenship and identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied 
Syrian Golan, and to desist from its repressive measures against the 
local population. It would also deplore the violations by Israel of 
the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time 
of War. 
<p>
By further terms, the Assembly would call upon Israel to comply with 
Security Council resolution 497 (1981) in which the Council decided 
that the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and 
without international legal effect. The Assembly would also call upon 
Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied 
Syrian Golan, and, in particular, to desist from the establishment of 
settlements. The Assembly would determine that all legislative and 
administrative actions purporting to alter the character and legal 
status of the occupied Syrian Golan constitute a flagrant violation of 
international law. 
<p>
The Committee approved the text on 10 November by a vote of 124 in 
favour to 1 against (Israel), with 1 abstention (United States). 
<p>

Working Group on the Financing of UNRWA .
