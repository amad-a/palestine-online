<h3>Addameer </h3>
<h3>Report on the Occasion of 17 April 2001, Palestinian Prisoners Day</h3>




<p>28 April 2001

<p>

Palestinian Prisoners Day occurs this year in the midst of the 
Palestinian Intifada, with continued incarceration of Palestinian 
prisoners and a daily increase in their numbers. 

<p>The year 2000 began with hopes that prisoners would be released 
as part of the signed agreements between Palestinians and the 
Israeli government. With the refusal of the Israeli government to 
abide by these agreements, a series of strikes and other activities 
by prisoners culminated in an open hunger strike of all Palestinian 
prisoners in Israeli jails during May 2000. The strike was supported 
by widespread demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins of Palestinians 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and with considerable 
international solidarity. These activities were met by severe Israeli 
repression leading to several deaths and hundreds of injuries, 
including those of ex-prisoners. The strike ended following an 
agreement between prisoners and the Israeli authorities under 
which certain demands were supposed to be fulfilled and others to 
be negotiated. However this agreement was never fulfilled and a 
further deterioration in conditions was noted. Stricter regulations 
against prisoners and their families were implemented, particularly 
following the onset of the Intifada.

<p>Israel's failure to abide with signed agreements, particularly those 
mandating the release of all Palestinian prisoners arrested before 
the signing of the Oslo agreement, was not the only Israeli 
violation. The Israeli authorities also retreated from many of the 
agreements that had been reached between prisoners and the 
Prison Authorities, worsening the already bad situation in Israeli 
prisons. These agreements were intended to bring the situation of 
detainees one step closer to internationally-accepted norms and 
were achieved only after a long struggle that claimed the lives of 
tens of Palestinian prisoners.
<p>
According to the latest figures from Addameer Prisoners and 
Human Rights Support Association, the number of Palestinian and 
Arab prisoners currently held in Israeli prisons and detention and 
interrogation centers is approximately 1960 prisoners. It should be 
noted that the number of those held in detention and interrogation 
centers is constantly changing.
<p>
Through regular visits to Israeli prisons and interrogation centers, 
Addameer has documented the following human rights violations: 
<p>
-- Shabeh: Shabeh or position abuse, in which detainees are 
shackled to a chair for up to 20 hours continuously, is still being 
practiced in Israeli prisons and interrogation centers despite the 
Israeli High Court decision of 6 September 1999 that supposedly 
outlawed the use of this torture method.
<p>
-- Physical and Psychological Pressure: Detainees are subject to 
physical pressure, threats, and exhaustion that aim to cause a 
nervous breakdown and the loss of physical and psychological 
control of detainees. Several interrogators conduct continuous 
interrogation sessions that may last up to two days. Thus 
detainees may be prevented from sleeping for long periods. 
Interrogation periods are renewed continually, sometimes lasting 
two-months or longer in which the detainee is subjected to such 
pressure.
<p>
-- Isolation: The detainee is isolated from the outside world and 
prevented from seeing a lawyer during almost the entire 
interrogation period. This restriction on lawyer visits occur in 4 to 8 
day periods that are renewed when the interrogators see necessary 
for a period that reaches 15 to 30 days long. Addameer's lawyer 
followed 129 cases in interrogation centers during the year 2000, 
and was prevented from visiting detainees under interrogation 112 
times, for periods varying between 15 to 30 days.

-- Collaborator Rooms: The Israeli General Security Services (GSS) 
has increased the practice of placing Palestinian prisoners in 
detention rooms with collaborators. The collaborators then attempt 
to extract information from detainees by claiming to be active in 
organizations outside the prison to gain the detainees trust. Israeli 
interrogators have developed this method as an integral part of the 
interrogation process, and there is no interrogation center that does 
not have a section devoted to this practice. Many times this 
process involves threats to the detainee's life if the detainee does 
not relinquish information easily and at times involves direct 
physical abuse.
<p>
-- Body Searches: Israeli Occupation Authorities conduct abusive 
and humiliating body searches - including strip searches - of 
Palestinian prisoners when moving them between sections of the 
same prison or detention center, or between different prisons. The 
same kind of abusive body search is conducted on families visiting 
detainees, despite the fact that visits are conducted from behind 
wired fences.
<p>
-- Family visits: Since the signing of the Oslo Accords, Israeli 
Authorities have moved Palestinian prisoners who are residents of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to prisons located inside Israel. 
This is a violation of international law and creates major difficulties 
for families in visiting detainees, as they are required to obtain 
permits to enter Israel. The process of getting these permits is a 
long and humiliating one, and permission is often denied. Since the 
end of September 2000, Israeli Occupation Authorities have 
canceled all previously issued permits and stopped issuing new 
ones. Families were not able to visit detainees, a punishment that 
affected both detainees and their families. Only Palestinian 
residents of Jerusalem were able to visit detainees since they are 
not required to obtain such permits. Thus families are prevented 
from bringing food, clothes and other needed supplies to detainees, 
items that detainees require and can only get from their families 
during visits. Such practices add to regulations introduced on 21 
June 1996 concerning family visits. According to these regulations 
only immediate relatives who are older than 40 years in age or 
younger than 16 years can visit. Another regulation was also 
implemented that requires family members to have a special 
clearance or permit. This process is extremely complicated and 
obtaining such permission requires a security clearance that is 
often denied as a means of placing further pressure on detainees 
and their families.
 <p>
-- Punishment Practices; Transfer and Isolation: Israeli authorities 
practice a general policy of regularly transferring Palestinian 
prisoners from one prison to another as a method of preventing 
prisoners from coordinating actions or strikes aimed at improving 
their detention situation or building a prisoners movement. This 
practice also creates further difficulties for families who are often 
unaware of the transfer and must delay their visit until they obtain 
permission to visit the other prison. There is a policy of detaining 
Palestinian prisoners in prisons that are located far from places of 
residence thus placing further obstacles to family visits. Palestinian 
prisoners are regularly placed in solitary confinement, preventing 
them from seeing other detainees or their lawyers. 
<p>
-- Phone calls: Palestinian prisoners have always been denied the 
right to make phone calls. Recently this has been one of the most 
important demands of prisoners due to the irregularity of family 
visits and the frequent banning of family visits outright. This is 
particularly important in situations of bereavement such as the 
death of a close family member.
 <p>
-- Discrimination against Palestinian detainees from Israel: 
Palestinian political detainees who are Israeli citizens are 
discriminated against in comparison to Jewish prisoners or to 
criminal prisoners. They are denied the rights guaranteed to Israeli 
prisoners by law such as phone calls, home visits, and face-to-face 
family visits. Israeli authorities have refused to deal with their case 
as a collective one and insist on considering each case 
individually. Authorities have only provided these rights on the 
provision that political prisoners are placed with criminal prisoners.
<p>
-- Granting of Parole: According to Israeli law, a prisoner who has 
served two-thirds of their sentence is eligible to apply to a special 
legal committee to look into their release. Through the experience 
of following such cases, Addameer Association has noted that 
discrimination against Palestinian prisoners is widely practiced 
within the Israeli judicial system. Israeli Jewish prisoners detained 
for different criminal charges or for murdering Palestinian citizens 
get their sentences reduced and are released by a special hearing 
or by a parole decision from the Israeli President. On the other 
hand, Palestinian political prisoners do not receive such reductions 
either from judges or the security apparatus. They rarely receive 
parole and in the cases where they do this is often only a few 
weeks before the end of their actual sentence. Reasons given for 
such a practice includes the claim that the Palestinian prisoners 
present a state security threat or that the general political situation 
does not warrant such a move. 
<p>
-- Health conditions: Addameer's lawyers have noted a policy of 
intentional medical neglect and prolonged delay of required 
treatment. This practice is intended to place further pressure on 
prisoners and includes the following:
   <ul><li> Not providing specialized medical services: Israeli prisons 
where Palestinians are detained have small, poorly equipped 
clinics staffed with an inexperienced nurse and a general physician 
who works only on certain days during the week.
    <li>Failure to provide required treatment: Medical personnel deal 
with prisoners in a biased manner and intentionally delay treatment 
or do not provide adequate medical care. Israeli prisons authorities 
often refuse to supply required specialized treatment for Palestinian 
prisoners through restricting the kinds of treatment provided.
    <li> Impeding access of Arab medical personnel: Israeli authorities 
put forward extremely difficult and very complicated conditions that 
prevent Arab physicians and medical personnel from being able to 
provide certain medical care to Palestinian prisoners.
</ul><p>
-- Juveniles: During the Intifada hundreds of Palestinian children 
under 18-years of age have been arrested and currently around 130 
are still detained in Telmond prison. The children have been placed 
in cells with those who have been detained for criminal offenses. 
Addameer Association is extremely concerned with the well being 
of these children as a result of their detention with criminal 
prisoners. The children have suffered from forms of abuse including: 
<ul><li> Child detainees have been beaten, scalded with hot water and 
cut with razors. 
    <li> There have been reports of sexual abuse against children by 
criminal prisoners that the Israeli prison administration has not 
investigated. In one case a child who complained of sexual 
harassment was beaten and had his legs cut with razors. Israeli 
authorities refused to move him from the section.
    <li> Belongings such as clothes, foods and shoes have been 
stolen by criminal prisoners.
    <li> Privileges such as telephone cards, cigarettes, shoes, and 
canteen purchases have been revoked. 
    <li> Newspapers, magazines and athletic equipment have been 
barred. 
    <li> Family visits have been denied since the beginning of the 
Intifada. Visits were permitted on 2 October 2000, for a period of 
four days and then banned again. This has caused severe 
psychological distress in children.  </ul>

<b>Ongoing violations against Palestinians during the Intifada</b> 
<p>
Israeli Authorities have used several methods in their attempt to 
crush the Intifada, some of which have not been used before while 
others have been used on a larger and more intense scale than 
previously witnessed. These include:
<p>-- The use of heavy weapons (artillery, tanks, attack helicopters, 
etc.): Israeli authorities have utilized disproportionate force and 
targeted Palestinian civilians and residential areas during the 
Intifada, killing and injuring scores of Palestinian civilians in their 
residencies or work sites and damaging whole residential blocks.
<p>-- Targeting and intentional killing of Palestinian children and the 
targeting of schools.
<p>-- The use of snipers and the use of firearms with silencers: From 
the very beginning of the clashes the Israeli army has provided 
soldiers with automatic guns and rifles that have silencers attached 
to them.
<p>-- Assassinations: The Israeli military campaign to assassinate 
Palestinians whom they have termed  'field leaders' is not a new 
practice. Israel has used such extra-judicial executions or 
assassinations in the past against political or military opponents 
within the occupied territories or in other countries. A well-trained 
assassination division has existed since the founding of Israel but 
this is the first time this policy has been implemented in such a 
wide-scale and open manner.
<p>-- Bulldozing Agricultural Areas: During the recent period Israeli 
authorities have launched a campaign to destroy and bulldoze 
agricultural land on an unprecedented scale. Thousands of acres of 
Palestinian agricultural land has been bulldozed and destroyed. In 
Gaza complete areas had been leveled including houses of farmers.
<p>-- Military closure: The prolonged implementation of a military 
closure on Palestinian villages and towns has turned these areas 
into cantons, isolating them not only from each other but from the 
rest of the world. This has caused severe damage to Palestinians 
in all spheres including the economy, education and health.
<p>-- Targeting Journalists: Israeli authorities have systematically 
targeted journalists during the recent conflict. More than 40 
journalists have sustained injuries during the Intifada either from 
live 
ammunition, plastic-coated-metal bullets or through beatings by 
Israeli soldiers or settlers.
<p>-- Settlements and Settlers violence: Settlement activities have 
escalated since the beginning of the Intifada and a green light has 
been given to settlers to activate their own settlement plans and to 
launch attacks on Palestinians. Settler attacks on Palestinians 
have become more frequent and armed militias of settlers have 
been formed to carry out attacks on Palestinians.
<p>-- Arrest Campaigns and House Raids: Israeli forces have escalated and 
widened 
their arrest campaign against Palestinians. Arrests are being conducted 
on 
military checkpoints and border crossings or by night raids on houses. 
Some 
common phenomena have been reported during night raids on houses, 
including:
<p>-- Raids are conducted after midnight and before dawn with large 
numbers of 
army troops and special units.
<p>-- Houses of targeted people within the same neighborhood or village 
are raided 
at the same time as the entire neighborhood is surrounded.
<p>-- Residents of the house and neighboring houses are forced to leave 
their 
homes during the raid which may continue for hours. This includes 
forcing 
children, elderly and even the sick to leave their homes.
<p>-- Trained dogs are sent into the houses after residents are forced out 
and 
before soldiers go in.
<p>-- Intentional damage is caused to furniture and house property during 
the raid.
<p>-- Abusive body searches of arrested persons and sometimes of their 
relatives 
are carried out. These have included forced strip-searches outside of 
the house.
<p>-- In most cases arrested persons are severely beaten, kicked and 
punched during arrest.

<p>The issue of Palestinian prisoners forms an integral part of the 
general Palestinian question and the struggle of Palestinian people 
to achieve their rights of freedom, independence, self-determination 
and return. These rights are guaranteed by international laws and 
conventions and by a series of United Nations Security Council and 
General Assembly Resolutions. Addameer Association condemns 
Israeli violations against Palestinian prisoners and their families as 
part of the continuing violations against the whole Palestinian 
people.
