<p>NEW YORK, US



<p>In New York, thousands of demonstrators virtually shutdown Times 

Square,

the hub of New York's theatre district, on Friday afternoon protesting 

the

killing of at least 80 Palestinians by the Israeli forces in Gaza and 

the

American support for Israel. They also offered their Juma prayers in 

the

Times Square. 



<p>Protesters carried Palestinian flags and banners saying "Stop The 

Israeli

Massacre of Palestinian Children" and "Stop the Bloodshed" as they 

chanted,

"End the Occupation Now." Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting 

for

the last nine days throughout Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 

The

conflicts have left 77 dead, and more than 1,900 injured, most of them

Palestinian.



<p>On countless posters they hoisted the photocopied image of 12-year-old

Mohammad al-Durrah in his father's arms, fatally wounded in the 

crossfire

in Gaza between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Marchers chanted "We're

Muslims, we're Americans and we vote," a message the protesters said 

they

were particularly eager to send to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the 

Democratic

candidate for Senate from New York.  



<p>"I'm here because I'm an anti-racist," said Shiko Bihar, a Jewish 

Israeli

graduate student at Columbia University. "This is state terror. " The

violence in the Middle East began after a Sept. 28 visit by Ariel 

Sharon,

the leader of the hard-line opposition Likud party, to the Jerusalem 

site

called Noble Sanctuary by Muslims and Temple Mount by Jews.



<p>To articulate their sorrow over children killed in the Mideast 

violence,

many protesters brought their children to the rally. They held flowers, 

sat

under police barricades, and pressed forward to share their thoughts.

Several said they would not forget the image of Mohammad slumped in his

father's arms, an image shown frequently on television and in the 

nation's

newspapers this week. 



<p>The presence of the massive crowd had police shutting the area down to

vehicle traffic during the evening commute. Hundreds of officers lined 

the

streets, and put up barricades to keep the demonstrators within one 

street

lane.



<p>AMMAN, JORDAN



<p>In Amman, Jordan, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets to 

protest

the Israeli massacre of Palestinians, clashing with hundreds of riot

police. Police blocked the streets leading to the Israeli Embassy in 

the

affluent district of al-Rabieh, firing tear gas at more than 1,000

protesters, who tried to march from the Kalooti Mosque after Muslim 

noon

prayers to the embassy. For several hours, police continued to fire 

tear

gas cannisters at the crowds, which repeatedly dispersed and regrouped,

trying to break the police barrier to reach the Israeli Embassy without

success. 



<p>Demonstrators chanted "Allah Akbar," (God is great), "We want to 

liberate

al-Rabieh from the Zionist boots," and "We are saying clearly, close 

the

Jewish embassy." They hurled stones at police, calling them "pigs of 

the

Zionists" as residents in the fancy buildings and small children gave 

away

onions to the demonstrators to reduce the effect of tear gas, a trick

learned from the Palestinians.



<p>Helicopters hovered over the capital, which witnessed a number of such

confrontations between angry protesters demanding the closure of the

Israeli Embassy and heavily-geared police in the first such widespread

demonstrations since the anti-U.S. protests during the 1991 Gulf war

against Iraq. Major intersections in Amman resembled a battle ground

littered with stones and tear gas cannisters, with black smoke from 

burning

tires and white smoke from the tear gas rising over Amman's valleys.



<p>Several police tanks and armored vehicles were mobilized in one main

intersection, carrying scores of riot police who fired bullets in the 

air

and tear gas cannisters into the crowds, which shouted: "Turn your guns

against the Jews."



<p>Friday's widespread protests, which also included similar moves in the

country's 13 Palestinian refugee camps after Friday noon prayers, came

despite pleas by government-appointed mosque imams (speakers) to 

refrain

from street protests and eventual clashes with police. One imam said:

"Don't turn the sacrifices of our people in Palestine into a 

confrontation

of Muslim against Muslim and Arab against Arab while the Jews 

watch...May

God take his revenge against the Jews, and may the White House be 

draped in

black."



<p>Osama Abdul Karim (18) was shot by anti-riot police who resorted to 

live

ammunition to disperse thousands of demonstrations at the entrance of 

the

camp. Camp residents said over 50 residents were hurt in the clashes.



<p>"A bullet hit me in the hip," said Ahmad Hussein, showing his injury 

and

adding that he feared going to hospital for treatment in the wake of a

police round up of suspects.



<p>On Friday night the Jordanian government issued a ban to the wave of 

street

protests against Israel, saying hooligans among disciplined protesters 

were

exploiting a public outpouring of emotions to vandalise public 

property.



<p>Scores of anti-riot police remained positioned on the main highway 

leading

to the camp in a show of force against renewed trouble, witnesses said.

Over the last few days, the government deployed hundreds of anti-riot

police with dozens of armoured personnel carriers and fired tear gas to

control hundreds of stone-throwing youths in the largest Palestinian 

camps

of Wihadat and Beqaa.



<p>Witnesses said scores of youths took to the streets, smashed traffic 

lights

and burnt tyres in various parts of the city after police used teargas 

to

disperse marches that planned to march on the Israeli embassy in Amman.



<p>THE HAGUE, THE NETHERLANDS



<p>In the Dutch city, the Hague a demonstration in front of the Israeli

embassy turned violent after provocative action from the Dutch police. 

Some

700 Palestinians, Arabs and Dutch gathered at 15.30 in front of the 

Israeli

embassy, across the Dutch parliament. There seemed to be a

misunderstanding about the police permit which said that only some 100

people were allowed on the square in front of the embassy and that 

others

should have stand in front of the parliament. However, at 15.45 some 

700

people gathered in front of the Israeli embassy and were stopped by the

Dutch police who were in full force with police on horses and riot 

police.



<p>When some Israeli flags were burned the police dismissed the 

demonstration

and started to disperse the demonstration. People were forced into the

direction that lead to the American embassy in the Hague, some 100 

meters

away from the Israeli embassy in the city's center. Palestinians 

chanted

slogans against the Israeli agression against Palestinians and against 

the

killing of children. Again, the Dutch police started to disperse 

violently

the demonstration. Some Palestinians and others were hit. 



<p>One of the protesters, a Palestinian after he was beaten by the Dutch

police with clubs said: "I expect this attitude and behaviour from the

Israeli occupation, but not from the Dutch police". He came to Holland 

in

1992 for medical care after he was released from

administrative detention in which he was severely tortured by his 

Israeli

interrogators.



<p>At one point some people responded to the police by throwing stones.

Passing the French embassy some windows were damaged. The Palestinians 

and

their supporters demonstrated against the Israeli violence against

Palestinian civilians. Most of the crowd came directly from the mosques

after attending Friday prayers.



<p>Three protestors were injured and four were arrested.



<p>SYRIA, DAMASCUS



<p>On Friday 6 October, Syrian security forces clashed with demonstrators 

in

Damascus and prevented them from approaching the U.S. Embassy. The

demonstrators, who came from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk 

near

Damascus, were protesting the Israeli attacks against

Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Hundreds of

Syrian anti-riot policemen and Army soldiers, who brought 

reinforcements to

the area and blocked all roads leading to the U.S. Embassy, clashed 

with

protestors who tried to force their way.  



<p>They dispersed the demonstrators, using tear gas and water, according 

to

witnesses who said a number of people were wounded "as blood stains 

trailed

on the ground" and a number of cars were damaged. Earlier, witnesses 

said

that anti-riot policemen and Army soldiers, wearing helmets and holding

clubs, cordonned off the area and blocked access to the U.S. Embassy, 

the

residence of U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and The American School.  



<p>They said four ambulances and four fire engines were seen in the area 

since

morning, while the security forces placed steel blocks on the ground.  

The

security measures were meant to prevent demonstrators from approaching 

the

embassy which came under stone-throwing attacks by angry Syrian 

protestors

on Wednesday. The embassy closed down after Wednesday's attack which

inflicted light material damage to the building. 



<p>BEIRUT, LEBANON



<p>Thousands of Palestinian refugees staged protests Friday in shantytowns 

in

south Lebanon, calling for resuming the armed struggle against Israel 

and

urging the Arabs to end normalization. More than 5,000 refugees

demonstrated inside the refugee camp of Ein el-Helweh on the outskirts 

of

the port city of Sidon in southern Lebanon, shouting "Yes to Jerusalem" 

and

"Jihad (armed struggle) should continue." The demonstrators included 

100

armed guerrillas of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas movements who paraded 

in

the camp. Most of the guerrillas had black hoods and wore on their 

backs

empty black boxes on which were written TNT explosives. They also 

carried

symbolic Soviet-made Katyasha rockets with banners that read: "With 

this

weapon, the enemy (Israel) understands." 



<p>The protesters in Ein el-Helweh waved Palestinian flags and banners 

that

called for backing the "Intifada" (uprising) of the Palestinian people 

in

the West Bank and Gaza. Jihad spokesman Abu Imad Rifai denounced the

"massacres" committed by Israel against the Palestinians and called for 

an

emergency Arab summit to prevent Israeli attempts to "Judaize 

Jerusalem."

Rifai said armed struggle was the only way to liberate Palestine and 

Holy

Jerusalem, saying the "Muslims in the Arab world would come to the 

rescue

of Palestine and will liberate Jerusalem." 



<p>Similar protests took place in refugee camps near the port city of Tyre 

in

southern Lebanon where thousands of angry demonstrators burned an 

effigy of

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. The protesters called on Lebanese

President Emile Lahoud to open the border in south Lebanon before 

military

operations by Palestinian guerrillas.  A camp leader in Rashidiyeh, 

Sheikh

Ali Daoud,on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to immediately stop the 

peace

talks "because they led us to where we are now." 



<p>On the Lebanese-Israeli front, dozens of Lebanese and Palesinian 

students

staged a sit-in for the second consecutive day in the Abbad post to 

express

solidarity with the "Intifada" of the Palestinian people. The students

performed prayers and waved to Israeli soldiers on the other side of 

the

fence with Palestinian flags and pictures of Palestinian children 

killed by

Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank. Security sources said Gen. 

Gaby

Ashkinazi, Israeli commander of the northern region, was inspecting the

Abbad area at a time of the protest and ordered his soldiers to move to

another position.  



<p>In Beirut, some 400 Lebanese gathered after the midday Muslim prayers 

while

Muslim Sunni Mufti (religious leader) Mohammed rashid Qabbani called 

for

Jihad to help the Palestinian people. Shortlly before, some 50 Lebanese

children protested in front of the U.N. House and handed a memorandum 

to

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan denouncing the killing of Palestinian

children by Israeli forces. According to UNICEF, 17 Palestinian 

children

were killed in a week of bloody confrontations in the West Bank and 

Gaza

while 40 percent of the injured were below the age of 18.



<p>KHARTOUN, SUDAN



<p>Thousands of Sudanese Muslims burning Israeli flags and chanting 

"Jerusalem

is ours!" demonstrated in Khartoum on Thursday in protest against 

Israel's

killing of more than 60 Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. Shouting 

"Allahu

Akbar, Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest),

the demonstrators demanded the return of Jerusalem to Arab control, 

with

some calling for holy war to "liberate" the city after violence over 

the

past week in the West Bank, Gaza and Israeli Arab towns.



<p>The protesters -- who included representatives of political parties, 

trade

unions, students and women -- demanded pro-Palestinian action from 

Muslim

governments and people, saying words were not enough. "The Arabs and

Muslims should no longer rely on negotiations but on the force of arms 

and

on the struggle for the liberation of Jerusalem," said the Secretary

General of Sudan's ruling National Congress party, Ibrahim Ahmed Omar.



<p>"Arab and Muslim governments should open up their seaports and airports 

so

that young people can go to Palestine to wage jihad (holy war)," one

protester shouted. The governor of Khartoum state, Majzoub al-Khalifa, 

said

Khartoum would put all its resources at the Palestinians' disposal for 

the

"liberation of the holy Jerusalem."



<p>The demonstrators marched to the local United Nations compound and 

handed

over a communique condemning the recent Israeli-Palestinian violence. 

"The

United Nations that speaks all the time about human rights and peace 

and

the struggle against terrorism is now turning a blind eye to the most

brutal human rights violations and terrorism," the statement said.



<p>REYKJAVIK, ICELAND



<p>In Iceland's capital Reykjavic, the Association Iceland-Palestine 

organised

a demonstration in down-town Reykjavik and a march to the Israeli 

Consulate

Friday Afternoon October 6th at 5pm, condemning the massacre by the 

Israeli

occupying force in Palestine and demanding an immediate halt to the

bloodbath. Over 100 participated, and the event was covered by radio,

television and newspapers.



<p>KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA



<p>Three hundred University of Malaya students Friday staged a peaceful

demonstration against Israeli violence towards Palestinians on the West

Bank and the Gaza Strip. The undergraduates assembled after Friday 

prayers

at the Ar-Rahman Mosque in Lembah Pantai here and then marched towards 

the

Kerinci LRT station carrying banners and shouting anti-Israel slogans.



<p>A spokesman of the university's Muslim Students Union said it denounced

cruelties committed by the Zionist regime against Palestinians, 

including

children. Policemen were on standby and monitored the situation. A

spokesman of Brickfields police headquarters here said there were no

untoward incidents and arrests. Meanwhile, PAS Youth wing vice chief

Salahuddin Ayub handed a protest note denouncing Israel cruelties 

against

Palestinians to a United Nations official here Anis Yusal Yussuf.



<p>VIENNA, AUSTRIA



<p>More than one thousand people protested in the centre of Vienna on 

Friday,

against the Israeli massacres. The demonstration was supported by a 

broad

coalition of Islamic, Christian and anti-imperialist forces while the

participants were predominantly Arab and Muslims from other countries.

After the mass rally the anti-imperialist forces continued the 

demonstration

with about 300 people passing at the El-Al office and calling for the

liberation of entire Palestine from imperialist and Zionist occupation.



<p>JAKARTA, INDONESIA



<p>Politicians, students and diplomats in Indonesia condemned on Friday 

the

"barbaric" attacks launched by Israeli troops against Palestinian

protesters. Indonesian news agency "ANTARA" reported that hundreds of

university students gathered in front of the United Nations office in 

the

capital city chanting anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans and urging the 

UN to

sanction the

killing of some 76 people, including children, by Israeli troops.

Meanwhile, thousands of Moslems performed the "ghaib" prayer at the

Istiqlal mosque in Central Jakarta.



<p>At the Al-Azhar Mosque, members of the Justice Party organized a 

protest as

soon as they finished performing Friday prayers. Justice Party 

secretary

general, Imam Nugraha, and a number of ulemas and Muslim figures 

gathered

at the mosque to express solidarity with the victims.

According to ANTARA, another Islam-based party, the Crescent and Star 

Party

issued a statement regretting the attacks and calling the UN to take 

stern

measures to bring the provocateur of the attacks --Israeli opposition

leader, Ariel Sharon -- before an international tribunal.



<p>The party also slammed the hypocrisy of the US and its allies for 

applying

double standard in observing human rights. The party also called the

government to refrain from establishing any relations with the state of

Israel.



<p>BERLIN, GERMANY



<p>Some 4,000 Palestinians staged a peaceful anti-Israel demonstration on 

the

streets of the German capital Friday following a week of violence in 

the

Middle East, police said. Earlier police reports said there had been 

2,500

demonstrators in central Berlin. Participants from

several Arab states chanted "Israeli aggression and the robbery of

Palestinian land" at a rally in front of city hall. Demonstrators said 

they

later planned to march to Berlin's landmark Brandenburg Gate about two

kilometres (one mile) away. Police said the event had passed without

incident, although they had confiscated several knives and Israeli 

flags

from demonstrators.



<p>KANO, NIGERIA



<p>More than 10,000 members of a Nigerian Islamic movement staged a

demonstration on Friday in northern city of Kano calling for the 

government

to cut diplomatic links with Israel. The demonstrators, members of

pro-Iranian Islamic group, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, said

they were making the call in protest against the upsurge of violence in 

the

Middle East. The protesters, who carried placard including "We condemn

Israeli massacre of Palestinians", and "Israel -- blood-thirsty demon,"

marched from the Fagge Juma at mosque to several parts of the ancient

Muslim-dominated city. When they reached the central mosque in the 

city,

they burnt Israeli and American flags.



<p>SHARJAH, UAE



<p>More than 10,000 people marched on Friday on the main streets of 

Sharjah to

denounce Israel's "massacres" of Palestinians, the state news agency 

WAM

said. Protesters "called on the international community to act quickly 

to

stop the Zionist butchery perpetrated against our brother Palestinians

people," the agency said. The march included Emirati nationals along 

with

foreigners from other Arab and Muslim countries, including 

Palestinians.



<p>LONDON, UK



<p>On Friday, a picket was being held outside Britain's Prime Minister's

office at Downing Street 10, expressing outrage at the failure of the 

UK to

condemn the Israeli killing of more than 60 Palestinians. Blair has yet 

to

make a statement since the massacres began over a week ago. Foreign

Secretary Robin Cook has deplored the killings but has avoided 

criticising

Israel in any way. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain was quoted saying

Thursday that the responsibility for the atrocities is "clear to 

everybody,

but issuing public denunciations gets us nowhere in the urgent quest 

for

peace." 



<p>BAGHDAD, IRAQ



More than 5000 Iraqi students on Saturday, Oct. 7, 2000, protest in 

Baghdad

against the latest Israel-Arab violence. The group burnt Israeli and

American flags and held up slogans demanding revenge for what they see 

as

Israeli-American aggression policies that are biased to Israel. 

Violence

across the West Bank and Gaza Strip, sparked by a visit by hard-line

opposition leader Ariel Sharon to a Jerusalem shrine holy to Muslims 

and

Jews, has so far claimed 80 lives, most Palestinian.



<p>ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN



<p>Demonstrators in the Pakistani capital on Friday condemned the killing 

of

Palestinians by Israeli security forces during a week of confrontations 

in

Israel and the occupied territories. A group of about 20 Palestinians,

representatives of about 200 Palestinians studying in Pakistan, burned 

US

and Israeli flags in front of the Faisal Mosque following Friday 

prayers.

Beside them about 150 Pakistanis participated in a rally by

Jamaat-e-Islami, the main Islamists party in the country. The 

organisation

said it was also holding demonstrations in other Pakistani cities. 



<p>Public demonstrations are relatively rare in the Pakistani capital and

about 30 police carrying sticks stood by as the protest against Israel 

was

held in front of the mosque, the largest in Asia. A total of 69 people,

almost all of them Arabs, have died in a week of clashes with Israeli

security forces that began with the visit of rightwing Israeli 

politician

Ariel Sharon to a site - called the Temple Mount by Jews and the 

al-Haram

al-Sharif by Muslims - that is sacred to both religions.



<p>DUBAI, UAE



<p>Men, women and children marched in Dubai on Friday to protest the 

violence

taking place in the occupied territories. Shouting slogans against 

Israel,

Zionism and Ariel Sharon - the Israeli opposition leader who triggered 

the

violence - the marchers showed their deep resentment of the Israeli

soldiers who shot Palestinians as they performed prayers at the Al Aqsa

mosque. Students from Ajman University began a protest march at 

Sharjah's

Khalid Lagoon but were stopped by the police and told they were not 

allowed

to march.



<p>Raad Fayed, an Ajman University student, told Gulf News that the 

Sharjah

Police patrol asked the protesters to stop their march and leave 

because it

is the weekend and they could cause a traffic jam. "When we were trying 

to

march early this afternoon, the Sharjah police stopped the march by a 

few

students from the Ajman University," he said.



<p>"My friends and I decided to come to Dubai to make our protest march 

and

were welcomed by a Dubai Police patrol who cleared the traffic for our

march, which started from the Corniche opposite the Hyatt Regency 

Hotel."



<p>He added that by the time they started their protest march in Dubai, 

they

were joined by more people from the street. "In a matter of minutes, 

people

had parked their cars and joined us, as also did passers-by. There 

weren't

just Palestinians in the protest march, but UAE nationals, Saudis, 

Iraqis

and Egyptians. Batoul Zaidan, another student at Ajman University, said

that on Wednesday when they attempted a protest march in the University

just as in many other

Arab countries, the university security stopped them. When they 

attempted

to go into the streets, Ajman police arrested a few students and took 

away

the the drivers' licences of the rest. "Apparently someone tipped off 

the

police about our intention to conduct a protest march because the 

patrols

were near the University just waiting for us, and normally they do not 

post

more than one patrol nearby," she explained.



<p>Elsewhere, hundreds of Palestinians and members of other communities 

took

part in a procession in Ras Al Khaimah yesterday. Protesters burned 

Israeli

flags and expressed messages of warm support for families and relatives 

of

Palestinians in the occupied territories. They also chanted slogans in

support of the Palestinians and expressed their anger at Israeli 

troops.



Kamal Abdul Rahman, who took part in the procession, said the 

Palestinian

community, in coordination with other Arabs and friends in Ras Al 

Khaimah,

would hold many other such processions. Also, members of the 

Palestinian

community would begin raising funds to support Palestinians in the 

Occupied

Territory.



<p>CAIRO, EGYPT



<p>Several policemen and students were injured as security forces tried to

stop demonstrators marching on the Israeli embassy on Friday. The 

clashes

followed a protest in Cairo against the Israeli massacre of Palestinian

civilians. The demonstration took place after Friday prayers.



<p>TUNIS, TUNIS



<p>Some 10,000 people gathered at a rally near Tunis on Friday, to voice 

their

support for Palestinians as clashes continued in Jerusalem. The crowd

shouted slogans at an officially-sanctioned rally in Kram, 10 

kilometres

north of the capital of this North African nation. "With our souls and 

our

blood, we will sacrifice ourselves for you, Palestine," the people 

shouted.

The rally was attended by officials, opposition parties and

non-governmental agencies.



<p>MUSCAT, OMAN



<p>In Muscat, for the third day running, more than a 1,000 demonstrators,

mainly students, marched for two hours in the heart of the capital near 

the

Sultan Qaboos Mosque. Policemen were present but did not intervene in 

the

march, a rarity in the sultanate. An Omani teacher, who was among the

protestors, said anything short of an independent Palestinian state 

with

Jerusalem as its capital would be unacceptable to the Arabs.  "Today, 

we

are precisely demanding this loudly

and collectively," said the teacher who requested anonymity.



<p>TEHRAN, IRAN



<p>In Tehran, some 10,000 people took to the streets to protest the death 

of

the Palestinians. "The only way left for the liberation of Palestine is

resistance and jihad (holy war) against the Zionist occupation," 

parliament

speaker Mahdi Karrubi told the demonstrators in the city's Palestine

Square. "Experience has shown that talks and reconciliation with Israel 

is an

exercise in futility," said Karrubi. Behind the podium from which he 

spoke,

a large banner said: "Death to America." The demonstrators also burned 

an

American flag.



<p>RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA



<p>In Riyadh, the imam of one of the Saudi capital's largest mosques 

called

for jihad against Israel and its supporters. "Washington supports 

Israel

blindly. American embassies, companies and individuals are legitimate

targets and must be targeted by Muslims all over the world," said the 

imam,

Sheikh Mansour bin Ali Al Hussein. His call for jihad coincided with a 

U.S.

announcement yesterday that its diplomatic missions in the Middle East

would be closed to the public for several days due to mounting Arab 

protests.



<p>KUWAIT, KUWAIT



<p>In Kuwait, human rights activist and candidate in the upcoming

by-elections, Omran Hassan Mohammad, will lead demonstrations which 

will be

held in front of the embassies of the permanent Security Council 

members to

protest the violence against the Palestinians. "A whole nation is

oppressed. We need to speak out against it," Mohammed told Gulf News in 

a

telephone interview. 



<p>Mohammed, who is a Shiite activist and teaches chemical engineering at

Kuwait University, was picked up by state security officers on Sunday 

when

he staged a one-man protest against the violence in front of the 

parliament

building. He said he was not charged and was released after 28 hours. 

He is

running for the seat of Al Adiliya constituency which was vacated in 

August

upon the death of liberal legislator Sami Al Munayes.



<p>Mohammed charged any protests against America or Israel are 

particularly

sensitive. "There are so many secret agents among us and they appear 

when

we speak out about America or Israel.  We live among fragile regimes 

who

are afraid that people will join in if I or others set up a protest," 

he

said. Mohammed was arrested twice in 1998 for demonstrating against 

U.S.

policies in the region. Today, Mohammad and other activists will stand 

in a

silent protest in front of the American, British, French, Russian and

Chinese embassies.



<p>TORONTO, CANADA



<p>Some 200 protested in Toronto on Friday. Dressed in an Israeli army

uniform and helmet, his hands and face covered in fake blood and 

standing

three feet higher than usual on makeshift stilts, the 30-year-old

contractor waved banners and paced up and down University Ave. across 

the

street from the U.S. consulate Friday to protest the recent violence

between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.



<p>As dozens of police officers stood ready, the Toronto protesters burned

American and Israeli flags and waved Palestinian flags outside the

University courthouse across from the consulate and carried two mock

coffins draped with Palestinian flags.



The coffins were for 12-year-old Mohammad Al Durra, who was shot and 

killed

by Israeli soldiers in Gaza during a clash this week between Israeli

soldiers and Palestinian protesters, and the ambulance driver who tried 

to

rescue him.



<p>"The stalling of the peace process and our frustration with that added 

up

with Ariel Sharon's visit ... and the killing of the 12-year-old boy 

are

the reasons we are here," said Ali Mallah, president of the Toronto 

chapter

of the Canadian Arab Federation.



<p>"We want peace back, but a fair peace," said Aikholani. "We want to 

show

people were are democratic," he said. "I am trying to do something for 

the

Palestinians. These are my cousins who died. They are your cousins 

because

together we are all human beings," he said. Mallah said U.S. policy in 

the

region favours Israel. "We are here to send a message to the U.S. to 

say

it's about time to stop the one-eye blind policies in the Mideast," 

Mallah

said.



<p>Concurrent pro-Palestinian demonstrations were also held in Hamilton,

Waterloo and Ottawa, Mallah said. The Toronto protest was the second in 

the

last two days.



<p>SAN FRANCISCO, US



<p>About 3,000 demonstrators in front of San Francisco City Hall later 

marched

to the Israeli consulate on Montgomery Street yesterday to protest the

Israeli forces' treatment of Palestinians during the violence in the 

Holy

Land. Protesters -- including this young girl

waving Palestinian flags -- burned Israeli flags, made impassioned 

speeches

and shouted anti-Israel slogans. San Francisco police said there were 

no

arrests.        



<p>PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC



<p>Some 250 people have demonstrated peacefully in front of the Israeli

Embassy in Prague, Radio Prague reported on Saturday. The 

demonstrators,

primarily Palestinians living in the Czech     

Republic, were protesting recent violent clashes in the West Bank and 

Gaza,

in which over 60 people, predominantly Palestinian have died, Radio 

Prague

added.



<p>CALGARY, CANADA



<p>In front of the City Hall of Calgary, more than 400 people protested 

Friday

against the latest

Israeli massacres in Palestine. All arabs (muslims and christians),

Canadians and non-arab muslims marched towards the American Consulate 

at

the Rocky Plaza Mall down town Calgary.  Tens of young guys with 

coffeyyahs

and Palestinian flags stood at the traffic lights and delivered 

leaflets

that described the latest massacres and pictures of the Martyr Rami Al

durrah and his father under the gunfire. The high one man-like cry in 

the

air was " Allahu AKbar"  . In English, the one we used most was Calgary

Calgary hear us cry Tell us why our kids must die.



<p>Police men walked around just making sure it was a peaceful rally.

Canadians pedestrians and drivers were very interested in taking the

leaflets and finding out what all this was about, and I think that was 

the

most important thing , spread awareness.  One Canadian guy, in his 

middle

age maybe 40, stopped me and said: "That is what you should have done 

long

time ago, and more often, we're sick of all this Israeli arrogance in 

front

of out noses, may God bless you".
