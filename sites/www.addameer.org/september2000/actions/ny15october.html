Pro-Palestinians stage demo against US policies </H2>









<p> 
(Times of India, 15 October 2000)

<p> NEW YORK: About five thousand Palestinian sysmpathisers staged
demonstrations here denouncing the United States' "pro-Israeli" 
policies
and demanded an end to the current violence in the middle east. 

<p> This was third straight day of demonstrations, pro Palestinians having
staged a protest on wednesday followed by a pro Israeli protest on 
thursday. 

<p> Carrying Palestinian flags and anti-Israeli placards, the protesters 
staged
a noisy demonstration friday in front the Israeli consulate and later
marched to the nearby United Nations building where one of the largest
pro-Palestinian rally and prayer service were organised.Marching along 
with
them were about a dozen anti-orthodox Jews to express their support for 
the
Palestinian cause. 

<p> The participants, who included a large number of women, criticised 
first
lady Hillary Clinton as also her Republican rival Rick Lazio for the 
senate
race from here and other leaders who had attended the pro-Israeli rally
thursday. 

<p> They said they want the American government to be just and even handed.
While every one in U.S. is upset over the Israeli soldiers
death.Consideration should be give to about one hundred Palestinians 
who
have been killed due to "Israeli violence," the protesters demanded. 

<p> But unlike thursday's pro Israeli demonstration which attracted about 
eight
thousand proestors and hordes of political leaders seeking support from
Jews who constitute twelve per cent of voters here, the pro-Palestinian
rally did not attract any major political figure. 

<p> No untoward incident was reported during the two-hour demonstration.
