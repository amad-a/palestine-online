<h3>THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2000</h3>
<hr>

<P>A call to Muslims worldwide to fast on Thursday November 2, 2000 to
show our support for Al-Aqsa
Mosque from the Muslims for Al Quds


<p>USA: A network of organizations is calling for a national week of teach-ins
and public forums to discuss “The Question of Palestine” during the week
of November 2-9  We are asking our chapters, activists, and local
affiliates to join with one another and with other concerned
organizations to hold public events, panels, speakers and films during
that week.  We urge all those who support the rights of Palestinians to
join these events -- or to take the initiative to organize an event in
your own community.

This week of teach-ins is co-sponsored by:  American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, Christian Peacemakers Team, Fellowship of
Reconciliation, Peace Action, War Resisters League, and Womens
International League for Peace and Freedom. U.S. branch.  Several other
peace organizations are also discussing becoming co-sponsors.

The current crisis makes this a good time to reach a wide public
audience whose interest has been newly awakened.  While there have been
many local activities already, a coordinated national day of educational
forums which bring together a variety of communities will have a wider
impact and more likely to draw media attention.

The teach-ins should address the current situation and show its roots in
the more than years of occupation and the more than 50 years of
dispossession. November 2 is the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration,
which some may find a timely moment in which to put the current crisis
into its historical perspective. In the current atmosphere, it is
essential that we help people look beyond the daily violence to the
history of injustice which lies at the root of the conflict.  This can
be an occasion for both political analysis and for the statement of
grief over the loss of life and the statement of support for all those
working for
peace in the region.

We ask organizations and individuals to reach out to one another and to
the public.  It is especially important to reach the media and provide
alternative voices to counteract the biased and too-often anti-Arab
coverage.  ADC can supply a packet of  information and resources to
use.  ADC is also working on producing a video of the recent clashes.
Please join in and plan one or more events during the week of November
2-9.  Please keep us informed of your activities.

plans for events during November 2-9, please contact:

asked to carry a light (supplied) to represent one of the men, women

<P>AUSTRALIA:
We here in australia are organising for Sunday Dec 10th (international 
human rights day) starting at noon exactly to be a day of protest. We 
hope to call out thousands upon thousands into the streets of sydney, 
melbourne & canberra in order to express solidarity and make certain 
that this cause is not lost in the image war that's also taking place 
at the moment. it would be fantastic if this was internationally 
coordinated and groups all around the world protest at this specific 
point in time. 

We are also working on that day (sunday) to be announced as 
International Black Ribbon Day for a Free Palestine. I am hoping that 
we will be able to make it truly international through our own 
individual grass roots organisations, amongst other networks we may 
belong to. it is essential that we try and coordinate this as much as 
is possible. we here in australia already have committments from 
groups in lebanon, indonesia and perhaps malaysia as well (including a 
few groups in Palestine) to coordinate on this front. If we can manage 
this it will be a resounding coup.
