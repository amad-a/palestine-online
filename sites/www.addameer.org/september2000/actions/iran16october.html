Iranian students call for Annan's support for Palestine </H2>



















<p> 

(IRNA, 16 October 2000)

<p> Tehran, Oct 16, IRNA -- Iranian university students on Monday called on
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to support Palestinians and
condemn the Zionist regime's crimes. In a letter delivered to United
Nations Representative Office in Tehran, the students asked several
questions from the secretary general. "Do you think the people who 
stage
demonstration to restore their trampled rights and are being subject to
heavy military attacks from the air, ground and the sea are not human 
being
and have not the right to live on the earth?" the letter asked Kofi 
Annan. 

<p> "Which statement from the Human Rights groups can justify shooting to 
kill
the demonstrators who throw stones to display their protest against
continued occupation of their lands?" The letter said the world 
conscience
is aware and shows its protests against Israel and its supporter, the 
U.S.
by holding worldwide demonstrations. Is not the time now for the United
Nations to comply with the world's public opinion?, it said. 

<p> "What the students of Iranian universities expect from you is that, as 
a
dignitary, support the Palestinian nation and condemn the Zionist 
regime as
a step to free the United Nations from the hegemony of the 
superpowers,"
the letter said. The students criticized the U.N. secretary-general for
focusing his mission to the region on three Israeli soldiers kidnapped 
in
Southern Lebanon rather than the Zionist regime's violent military 
action
against civilian demonstrators in Holy Qods, al-Khalil and other 
occupied
territories of Palestine since September 28, the day on which the 
Zionist
convicted war criminal Ariel Sharon made a publicized visit to holy 
Qods.
