 Palestinian-Americans Protest Violence</H2>

     <p>Palestinian-Americans angry over the reported American
     support of the Israeli military demonstrated Friday in front of
     the Federal Court Building in downtown Phoenix.

     <p>"We are here to tell the U.S. to stop helping the government
     that is committing genocide against our people," said Marwan
     Ahmad, one of the organizers of the demonstration.

    <p> Nearly 300 people flanked First Avenue holding placards
     reading "Zionism is Racism" and "Stop the Killing of
     Palestinians," to call attention to what they say is U.S. aid to
     Israel and to the Palestinian plight in the Mideast where more
     than 100 people have been killed and more than 2,000
     people have been injured in three weeks of fighting.

    <p> The United States is contributing to the killing, said Hafez
     Turk, another organizer, by funneling billions of tax dollars
     into Israel's military.

     <p>An employee of the Federal Court Building who agreed to
     speak on anonymity said that the protest on Friday, which
     was supposed to be the first day of a truce agreed upon by
     Israeli and Palestinian leaders, was the second peaceful
     Palestinian protest in front of the court building in the past
     week.

    <p> Ahmad said Valley protesters were part of a larger national
     effort being staged in other cities throughout the country
     including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. He said that
     nearly one million people are expected to rally Oct. 28 in
     Washington D.C. for a one million person march to bring
     awareness to the problem in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
