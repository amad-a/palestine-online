<p>Dear Editor, CNN Interactive,

<p>I noticed on your site that CNN Interactive is not sure about Israel's 
occupation of Palestinian land. In your report you stated "what they 
see as Israel's occupation of their land" (October 17, 2000).

<p>http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/10/17/mideast.summit.04/index.html

<p>Not only terms the United Nations Israel as "the occupying Power" (UNSC 
1322, October 2000) also the Israeli Supreme Court sitting as a High 
Court of Justice, considered the Hague Convention to be fully applicable 
to the occupied Palestinian territories and that Israel is bound by its 
provisions as a belligerent occupant.

<p>Since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 
wake of the 1967 war, the international  community continues to consider 
Israel as the occupying power of these territories. CNN used to write 
captions such as "occupied Westbank" when it reported in the early 90s, 
however after the signing of the Oslo Accord, it seems that CNN has 
wrongly suggested that the territories are not occupied.

<p>Both Meir Shamgar, the former President of the Supreme Court of Israel 
and Professor David Kretzmer of the Hebrew University, believe that the 
Fourth Geneva Convention continues to apply and that Israel remains 
ultimately the belligerent occupant.

<p>The international community regard the Gaza, Westbank including 
Jerusalem, occupied by Israel as a result of the 1967-war and as such, subject 
to provisions of both the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Fourth 
Geneva Convention of 1949 (see UNSC 242, 338, UN Doc. S/INF/29). The 
Israeli annexation of Jerusalem following its occupation was also declared 
illegal by the international community (see UNSC 465, 904).

<p>Since the Oslo "peace process" did not end the Israeli occupation, the 
Westbank and Gazastrip including Jerusalem cannot but be termed as 
occupied territories until that occupation comes to an end. Therefore, to 
uphold CNN's status as a non-partisan news source, CNN must add 
"occupied" in front of any caption that includes "the Westbank", "Gaza" or 
"Jerusalem". Please let me know about the steps CNN takes in this respect.

<h3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="arjan"></a></font>Letter to the 

  Editor of the Montreal Gazette</h3>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"><p> by Arjan El Fassed
<p>
Dear editor,

<p>I was shocked to read L. Ian McDonald's "Missed Opportunity" (Montreal
Gazette, 16/10/2000) in which he opposes UN resolution 1322 (National 
Post,
10/10/2000) in which the international community raises its concern 
about
the use of excessive force against the Palestinian population, 
including
the indiscriminate use of automatic weapons, exploding bullets, 
helicopter
gunships, tanks and rockets.

<p>For Mr. McDonald there is obviously no place on this world for 
Palestinian
children. Probably Mr. McDonald wishes that Palestinians did not exist.
Didn't he saw how the Israeli's shot and killed little Mohammed, 
two-year
old Sarah and 18-months year old Rania? 

<p>What happens when the Montreal Gazette readers discover that your good
friend Israel is killing children? What happens when your readers know
about the brutal occupation? What happens when they discover that Mr.
McDonald's good friend Israel is committing crimes against humanity and 
war
crimes? What happens if your readers see images of a Palestinian beaten
with clubs and burned to death by Israeli settlers? What happens if 
your
readers hear the sounds of live ammunition coming from Israeli guns 
killing
more than hundred, wounding thousands? What happens if your readers
discover that the Canadian government sustains these excessive actions 
by
Israel by not having Israel comply with international law and human 
rights.

<p>Do you believe in the sanctity of life? 

<p>Yours,

<p>Arjan El Fassed

<h3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="arableague"></a></font>Letter to the 

  Arab League</h3>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
<p>Secretary General Dr. Esmat Abdel-Meguid League of Arab States <p>Al Tahrir Square, 

  P.O. Box 11642, Cairo, Egypt <p>Telephone: +20-2-575-0511, +20-2-575-2966 <p>Facsimile: 

  +20-2-574-0331

<p> <b>Subject: Emergency Arab Summit on Al-Aqsa Intifada</b> <p>Dear Dr. Abdel-Meguid:<br> 

  On behalf of the martyr's of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, please accept the following 

  text to be included in the preamble of the final communiqué to your upcoming 

  Emergency Arab Summit:



<p> 1.That the rule of Palestine should revert to its inhabitants, 

  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and that 

  the Palestinians should alone have the right to determine their future.



<p> 2.This 

  state of affairs is threatening to spread to the neighboring Arab countries, 

  where feeling is running high because of the events in Palestine. The Governments 

  of the Member States of the Arab League and the United Nations are exceedingly 

  worried and deeply concerned about this state of affairs. <p>3.The Governments 

  of the Member States of the Arab League and the United Nations had hoped that 

  the United Nations would have succeeded in finding a peaceful and just solution 

  of the problem of Palestine, in accordance with democratic principles and the 

  provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, so that peace, security and 

  prosperity would prevail in this part of the world.



<p> 4.The Governments of the 

  Arab States, as members of the Arab League, a regional organization within the 

  meaning of the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, 

  are responsible for maintaining peace and security in their area. These Governments 

  view the events taking place in Palestine as a threat to peace and security 

  in the area as a whole and also in each of them taken separately.



<p> 5.Therefore, 

  as security in Palestine is a sacred trust in the hands of the Arab States, 

  and in order to put an end to this state of affairs and to prevent it from becoming 

  aggravated or from turning into a state of chaos, the extent of which no one 

  can foretell; and in order to stop the spreading of disturbances and disorder 

  in Palestine to the neighboring Arab countries; the Governments of the Arab 

  States have found themselves compelled to intervene in Palestine solely in order 

  to help its inhabitants restore peace and security and the rule of justice and 

  law to their country, and in order to prevent bloodshed.



<p> 6.The Governments of 

  the Arab States recognize that the independence of Palestine, which has so far 

  been suppressed by Israel, has become an accomplished fact for the lawful inhabitants 

  of Palestine. They alone should exercise the attributes of their independence, 

  through their own means and without any kind of foreign interference. The governments 

  of the Arab States emphasize, on this occasion, what they have already declared 

  before the United Nations, that the only solution of the Palestine problem is 

  the establishment of a Palestinian State, in accordance with democratic principles, 

  whereby its inhabitants will enjoy complete equality before the law, and whereby 

  minorities will be assured of all the guarantees recognized in democratic constitutional 

  countries and whereby the holy places will be preserved and the rights of access 

  thereto guaranteed.



<p> 7.The Arab States most emphatically declare that their intended 

  intervention in Palestine is due only to these considerations and objectives, 

  and that they aim at nothing more than to put an end to the prevailing conditions 

  in Palestine. For this reason, they have great confidence that their action 

  will have the support of the United Nations; that it will be considered as an 

  action aiming at the realization of its aims and at promoting its principles, 

  as provided for in its Charter.<p> Dr. Abdel-Meguid, with the above preamble text 

  already drafted, we hope that all of your time and efforts at the upcoming Emergency 

  Summit will be focused on the necessary actions required to establish an independent 

  State of Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital and securing the legitimate 

  rights of all Palestinians as stipulated in numerous UN resolutions and International 

  Law. <p>Lastly, given our brethren in Palestine, and that Arab World in its entirety, 

  are still mourning, among others, martyrs Mohammed Aldura, 12 years old, and 

  Sara Abdel Haq, 1-1/2 years old, both who were murdered in cold blood last week, 

  we did not have the ability to imagine new text. Thus, each and every item listed 

  above is nearly verbatim, from your past meetings/statements - - preciously 

  from the Statement by the Arab League States Following the Establishment of 

  the State of Israel 15 May 1948. With all due respect, and given the seriousness 

  of the moment, we only ask you to take real action - if not for the sake of 

  Mohammed and Sara, then for the sake of the rest of the children of Palestine 

  and the Arab World who are still yearning for a normal childhood, free from 

  occupation, poverty, and repression.

<a name="ali2"></a> <b>URGENT: JEWISH EXTREMIST GROUP TO MARCH ON AL-AQSA, LAY 

CORNER STONE FOR "THIRD TEMPLE"</b> 



<p>The Temple Mount 

Faithful, an extremist Jewish  group committed to destroying the Aqsa Mosque 

and Dome of the Rock at the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem has announced its 

intention to march on the Haram on Monday and "lay the cornerstone" for a 

Third Jewish Temple. The seriousness of this threat cannot be  overstated. 

<p>If Israel does not prevent this action, as it is required to  do as an Occupying 

Power, it will solely bear the consequences,which could be  disastrous 

for everyone in the region. The Temple Mount faithful connived with the 

Netanyahu government in 1996 to open a tunnel under the Al-Aqsa in 1996, 

sparking clashes which killed over 60 Palestinians and 15 Israeli occupation 

soldiers. <p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 271 of September 

15, 1969 passed in the wake of an arson attack on the  Al-Aqsa Mosque by a 

pro-Jewish fanatic stated that, " that any act  of destruction or profanation 

of the Holy Places, religious buildings and sites in Jerusalem or any encouragement 

of, or connivance at, any such act may seriously endanger international peace 

and security," and condemned the failure of Israel to protect the Holy  

Places as it is bound to do under the Geneva Conventions. <p>The group 

claims that "The event has the approval of the Israeli authorities and will 

be protected by the Israel security forces." If Israel does act to prevent 

this, will they  use live ammunition and rockets against Jews, as they insist 

they must against Palestinians, or are such measures only for Arabs?  

Below, for reference, I have included the full  text of the Temple Mount 

Faithful Statement, and the text of UN  Resolution 271.

<center>STATEMENT FROM "TEMPLE MOUNT FAITHFUL" FOLLOWS BELOW</center>

<p> The Temple Mount and Land of Israel 

Faithful  Movement<br> Jochanan Horkanos <br>4, P.O.Box 18325 Jerusalem, Israel<br> Tel: 

6251112 Tel/fax 6251113    

 <p><i>You are invited to march with The Temple Mount  and Land of Israel 

Faithful  Movement to the Temple Mount and participate in the ceremony of the 

anointing of the cornerstone for the Third  Temple. We shall march from the 

Temple Mount to the  City of King David where the  ceremony of the anointing 

will take place. Then we shall march to the Pool of Siloam for the ceremony 

of the Pouring of  the Water will take place as it  was done in Biblical times. 

The marble cornerstone, untouched by iron,  weighing four and a half tons, 

will be carried  on a flat-bed truck, covered  with Israeli flags together with 

the reconstructed vessels for the Third Temple, a priest in the original garments, 

and Levites who will play music. This historical event will take place on 

Monday 16th October 2000, the third  day of Sukkoth, at 09:00 AM. We shall 

meet at  the Western Wall plaza close  to the western (Mugrabi) gate of the 

Temple  Mount.  The event has the approval of the Israeli  authorities and 

will be protected by the Israel security forces.  Israel, the Chosen People 

of G-d, is now living in the most exciting time in  their history. These are 

the godly, prophetic end-times and G-d is redeeming the people of Israel. 

The biggest dream and  vision of the G-d and people of  Israel is becoming a 

reality in the great time  in which we are living in the  sight of all nations. </i>

<h3>Letter from Ali Abunimah to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan</h3>

<b>October 12, 2000</b> 

<p>Dear Mr. Annan, 

<p>I have been following with interest your intense activities in the Middle East. 

  Like many people, I welcomed your involvement. Now, however, I find myself confused 

  as to what your goals are. 

<p>We are hearing reports that you had lately brokered a meeting of Israeli and 

  Palestinian "security" officials to be chaired by the head of the United States 

  Central Intelligence Agency. Is this now the role of the United Nations? 

<p>Last week, the Security Council passed Resolution 1322, which, "Calls upon 

  Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations 

  and its responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 

  Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949." 

<p>And yet, Israel has continued its flagrant violation of this convention, and 

  continues to use its armed forces against the civilian population in the occupied 

  territories. 

<p>We have not heard from you what steps you intend to take to implement this 

  Resolution, nor the countless other Resolutions protecting the Palestinian people 

  against their occupier, which sit gathering dust in UN files. 

<p>Mr. Annan, there is an occupation which must end. The Security Council has 

  said so. It is your role to seek an end to the occupation, not to arrange meetings 

  between "security" officials in order to make the occupation more pleasant for 

  the occupier. 

<p>There are many people in the Middle East who are surprised that you have been 

  rushing from capital to capital to secure the release of three Israeli soldiers 

  taken prisoner in Lebanon. They ask themselves why dozens of Lebanese prisoners, 

  and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held for long years in Israel did not 

  motivate you to seek their release. 

<p>They wonder why you have allowed yourself, and the United Nations whose lofty 

  Charter gives hope to millions, to be reduced to nothing more than a Federal 

  Express service for the Americans. 

<p>As I am sure you are aware, the United States has for years excluded you, and 

  the whole international community from any role in the Middle East, because 

  they claimed that they alone know how to make peace. Because they supported 

  only the strong, sidelined justice, scorned international law, and ignored the 

  suffering and pleas of the Palestinian people, we have arrived at this ugly 

  place. 

<p>They send you in when they have failed, so that you can take the blame. I hope 

  you will find your courage to go back to New York and stand before the world. 

  Tell them what you know: occupation does not bring peace. Human rights abuses 

  do not bring security. And meetings with the CIA are not a substitute for international 

  law. 

<p>Sincerely, Ali Abunimah <a href="http://www.abunimah.org">http://www.abunimah.org</a>

<h3> Letter from Marwan Tarazi to Mike Hanna, CNN: Biased Reporting is unprofessional</h3>

<p>Mr. Hanna, 

<p>Your biased reporting is totally unjustified! Why has it become a "matter of 

  fact" that the two Israeli soldiers "strayed" into PA territory. Who gave you 

  or CNN the right to make this decision? BASIC reporting dictates that you should 

  give the facts to your viewers and not make the decision for them. Your version 

  of the story is that of the Israeli Government, which you very well know is 

  a master in deception and in twisting facts. 

<p>Further more, why did you give the mob killing by two soldiers so much coverage 

  and media attention? Why didn't you do the same about the Palestinian who was 

  murdered pretty much the same way only a few days ago by Israeli settlers? Why 

  didn't you make reference to that murder in your reports? 

<p>Sir, the death of the two soldiers was mob action. The death of the majority 

  of the Palestinians during the past two weeks is a systematic "execution" following 

  an official State policy for a people under siege. This is atrocious and unacceptable 

  under any international law or by any civilized society. Why do you choose not 

  to highlight this fact in your reporting? 

<p>Please act according to your professional code of ethics and stop your biased 

  reporting Marwan Tarazi, Jerusalem
