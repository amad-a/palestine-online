SA feels heat of Middle East as protesters take to street </H2>



















<p> 

(BusinessDay, 16 October 2000)

<p> SA MIGHT be thousands of miles away from the fire consuming the Middle 
East
but the heat the decades-old conflict has generated was felt locally 
this
weekend when Muslim communities took to the streets to pledge their
solidarity with the Palestinian cause.

<p> As government moved to set up a task group last week to monitor the
situation locally and internationally, Jewish and Muslim religious 
leaders
called on their respective followers at the weekend to remain calm.

<p> Early reports yesterday indicated that a McDonald's outlet was attacked
after a peaceful march in Cape Town. In Pretoria, another march by 
about
1200 to the US and Israeli embassies almost turned nasty when there was 
a
brief stand-off between marchers and the police.

<p> An organiser of the march in Pretoria, Imthiaz Jhetani, said a police
superintendent provoked the stand-off by jumping into the crowd, "and 
then
pandemonium broke out when police said they would not allow the march".

<p> The situation, he said, was saved by foreign affairs representative 
Jerry
Matsila, who offered to accompany the marchers to the Israeli embassy,
where they made a political statement rather than hand over a 
memorandum to
an "illegitimate Israeli government".

<p> Jhetani said: "Israel is an imperial power (and) more than 50% of the
people who have been killed in the conflict in Palestine are children. 
As
an organisation we were educating people about that."

<p> The African National Congress also organised a solidarity meeting in
Lenasia, Johannesburg, last Saturday, where the Palestinian ambassador
outlined the roots of the conflict.

<p> The Palestine Solidarity Committee said at the weekend it was a 
travesty to
reduce the struggle of the Palestinian people to a religious struggle
"their struggle is a struggle for democracy", said its chairman, Salim 
Vally.

<p> This followed the steady escalation of violence in the past weeks 
between
Palestinian protesters and the Israelis, culminating in the latter 
bombing
what they called military targets.

<p> Domestically, Israel's action has been denounced by the Muslim 
community
and sympathisers of the Palestinian cause, with several demonstrations
organised in larger cities.

<p> A senior Jewish student at the University of Cape Town, who asked not 
to be
named, said a lunchtime march on the campus last Wednesday had been
peaceful until the "about 50 or 60 marchers started shouting 
inflammatory
statements".

<p> She said: "It was something along the lines of long live Hezbollah and
Hamas'. Basically, we are fully for freedom of expression because we 
want
to keep the peace, but Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorists and these
utterances go against what we as Jews believe."

<p> She also said that while "there was not a huge turnout" for the march, 
"I
believe that it was attended by people from outside the university".

<p> Vally stressed in an interview that he does not speak on behalf of 
Muslims.

<p> He said that many Muslims, Christians and a lot of Jewish people who 
did
not support Zionism, supported the Palestinian cause.

<p> "It is important to remember that the Palestinian struggle is a 
struggle
for liberation, human rights and a struggle against racism. We in the
committee believe that Zionism is racism.

<p> "If we look at our own country, the Zionist government of Israel
collaborated fully with apartheid SA. In the past they shared 
intelligence
information, they collaborated militarily and went as far as developing
nuclear devices as well," he said.

<p>The committee believes Israel is an apartheid state: "it has been 
founded
on pillage and is predicated on exclusivity. Rights in Israel flow from
ethnic and religious identity." He said for almost five decades,
Palestinians had faced numerous massacres.

<p>"The point is that the Oslo peace accords are about setting a dependent
Bantustan alongside an apartheid state, and it is a mockery of
self-determination," Vally said.

<p>"In SA, we fought long and hard," he said. "For us, minimum justice
required the dismantling of the apartheid state and replacing it with a
democratic secular state, so why should it be different in Israel?"

<p>He said the committee was calling for the replacement of Israel with a
democratic, secular Palestine, "where Jews and Arabs, Christians and
Muslims live together with equal rights and opportunities".

<p>"I think people are very clearly saying you cannot have peace without
justice. Apartheid Israel cannot exist without the US treasury; since 
1948
the US has spent more than $150bn of US tax money to finance Israel."

<p>Israel, he said, was a state that had been built on expulsion,
dispossession and subjugation.

<p>"There is a real hypocrisy because Israel invaded another country, 
Lebanon,
and the US did nothing against that. But look what happened to Iraq 
there
were sanctions against Iraq," Vally said.

<p>"The committee calls on government to suspend all diplomatic, trade,
political and military links with apartheid Israel.

<p>"We cannot remain neutral in this struggle. To be neutral means to be 
an
accomplice to oppression. To be silent means complicity," he said.

<p>The Jewish Board of Deputies said the domestic Jewish community did not
necessarily feel threatened, "but we are taking the necessary 
precautions.
We are concerned at what is taking place in Israel." Its spokesman, 
Yehuda
Kay, said: "We pray for peace in Israel and we feel that the only way 
to
end the violence is through negotiations."
