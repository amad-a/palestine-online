<H2>   Demonstration against Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians<br> in

Palestine turns violent after provocative action by Dutch police<br>

  Friday 6 October, 8.00PM GMT +2 </H2>









<p>THE HAGUE, 6 October - In The Hague (Holland) a demonstration in front 

of

the Israeli embassy turned violent after provocative action from the 

Dutch

police. Some 700 Palestinians, Arabs and Dutch gathered at 15.30 in 

front

of the Israeli embassy, across the Dutch parliament. There seemed to be 

a

misunderstanding about the police permit which said that only some 100

people were allowed on the square in front of the embassy and that 

others

should have stand in front of the parliament. However, at 15.45 some 

700

people gathered in front of the Israeli embassy and were stopped by the

Dutch police who were in full force with police on horses and riot 

police.

When some Israeli flags were burned the police dismissed the 

demonstration

and started to disperse the demonstration.



<p>People were forced into the direction that lead to the American embassy 

in

the Hague, some 100 meters away from the Israeli embassy in downtown 

The

Hague. There Palestinians chanted slogans against the Israeli agression

against Palestinians and against the killing of children. Again, the 

Dutch

police started to disperse violently the demonstration. Some 

Palestinians

and others were hit. One of the protesters, a Palestinian after he was

beaten by the Dutch police with clubs said: "I expect this attitude and

behaviour from the Israeli occupation, but not from the Dutch police". 

He

came to Holland in 1992 for medical care after he was released from

administrative detention in which he was severely tortured his Israeli

interrogators.



<p>At one point some people responded to the police by throwing stones.

Passing the French embassy some windows were damaged. The Palestinians 

and

their supporters demonstrated against the Israeli violence against

Palestinian civilians. Most of the crowd came directly from the mosques

after attending Friday prayers.
