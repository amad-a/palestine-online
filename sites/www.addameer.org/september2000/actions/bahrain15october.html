Bahrainis march to protest West Bank killings </H2>

Latheef Farook (Gulf News, 15 October 2000)

<p> The U.S. Embassy in Bahrain and 21 other U.S. diplomatic missions in 
the
region will be shut until tomorrow due to rising anti-American 
sentiments
in the wake of killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza by
Israeli soldiers and the attack on a U.S. Navy destroyer.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to streets in peaceful processions
following Friday prayers carrying posters of Al Aqsa Mosque and 
shouting"
Death to Israel and" Death to America".

<p> One such rally set out from the Hamad Kanoo Grand Mosque and ended with
speeches by number of Islamic scholars who spoke of the significance of 
Al
Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and condemned Israel for killing Palestinians.

<p> Special prayers were also offered in many mosques during Friday prayers
when both Israel and its supporters, especially United States, came 
under
criticism.

<p> As a mark of solidarity with Palestinians, the Chairman of Bahrain
Journalists Association Nabeel Al Hamer has urged the BJA members to 
donate
their one day's salary to extend support to the Palestinian people.
