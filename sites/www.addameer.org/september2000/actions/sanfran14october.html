Israeli Attacks Against Palestinians Protested in San Francisco</H2>



















<p> 

By Richard Edmondson (San Francisco Liberation Radio, October 14, 2000)

<p>More than a thousand people rallied and marched in downtown San
Francisco today in opposition to a wave of Israeli military violence
against Palestinians that has shocked the world over the past two 
weeks.

<p>Proliferating throughout the crowd were a number of signs and banners,
including several containing a photographic triptych depicting the
shooting of Muhammed al-Durrah, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who
perished, along with his father, in a hail of Israeli gunfire.

<p>The same series of snapshots also appeared upon thousands of post cards
which were addressed to California Senator Barbara Boxer and which were
circulated throughout the crowd.

<p>"Not in our name!" the postcards proclaimed, additionally calling for
support for an international commission of inquiry and an end to U.S.
aid to Israel.

<p>One of the speakers who addressed the crowd was Hatem Bazian, a former
student body president at San Francisco State University who now 
teaches
at U.C. Berkeley.

<p>"This may not do anything," Bazian said of the post cards. "But I want
people to remember this. I want every politician to know that they
cannot say, 'I didn't know about this.' Yeah, you did-and not only 
that,
you voted for more aid for Israel, so when you get to the Nuremberg
trial you can't say, 'I was just following orders.' You were giving the
order. This is what we need to tell these people."

<p>The entire rally will be broadcast tape-delayed at 9 p.m. Pacific time
tonight on San Francisco Liberation Radio (SFLR), an unlicensed radio
station with a 4-5 mile broadcast radius operating in the city of San
Fancisco.

<p>Other speakers at the rally included Radia Hajezzi, a student at U.C.
Davis, Dr. Dwight Simpson, professor of International Relations at San
Francisco State University, Richard Becker of the International Action
Center, and SFLR DJ Jeffrey Blankfort. But perhaps the most poignant
moments of the afternoon came with short speeches given by two
Palestinian children, 12-year-old Kamal, and 7-year-old Mesa.

<p>"All I say is stop killing these kids that are just like me," said
Kamal. "When I saw the picture (of the killing of Durrah) I started
crying. And I'm about to cry right now. So let me just say, 'Long live
Palestine!'"

<p>Palestinian flags were much in evidence throughout the crowed, while
passing motorists frequently honked in solidarity.

<p>"There's no peace without justice, and this is the message we have to
give also to the American media," said Palestinian journalist Lamis
Andoni, a correspondent for Middle East International who has also had
articles published in the Financial Times of London and Le Monde
Diplomatique. "The American media has been engaged in complicit
dehumanization and a complicit and systematic campaign for the control
of the Palestinian people."

<p>Andoni's criticisms of the U.S. corporate-controled media were echoed 
by
numerous other speakers.

<p>"They call it-the New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the
rest of them-they call it lynching and murder when they see two Israeli
soldiers killed. But no such terminology is ever used when a hundred
Palestinians are shot and killed," said Becker. 

<p>He added:

<p>"I just wanna say this in closing-that in all of the developments,
including, I have to say, what happened to the U.S.S. Cole, there is
something that isn't being brought up. Everyone is sorry to see young
people killed. But someone has to raise the question: 'What was the
U.S.S. Cole doing, and where was it going?' It was going to the Gulf to
enforce the blockade, the genocidal blockade against Iraq."

<p>The protest today is the latest in a series of San Francisco protests
which have targeted Israel for its military assaults, including
helicopter gunship attacks, against the mostly unarmed Palestinian
population.
