(IRNA, 14 October 2000)

<p> New Delhi, Oct 14, IRNA -- Activists of the Indo-Palestine Friendship 
Society today went on a day-long hunger strike outside the Israel     
Embassy here to demand withdrawal of Israeli army from the entire     
Palestine area including Jerusalem.

<p> The activists, led by Jammu and Kashmir Panther's party chief Bhim
Singh, demanded implementation of resolutions passed by the Security  
Council of United Nations and the agreement reached at Oslo. They also
submitted a memorandum for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak asking him to apologise for the massacre of Palestinians and    
pay for the death and destruction caused by Israeli army.

<p> Urging Barak to give peace a chance, the memorandum asked for a   
complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied areas,        
including Golan heights.                                              

<p> The activists were, however, detained by police in the afternoon  
and later released.
