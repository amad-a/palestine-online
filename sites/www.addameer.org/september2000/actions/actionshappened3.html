<p>Refugees' demonstrations call for end to all contacts with Israel<br>
By Dalal Saoud (UPI, 21 October 2000)</h3>

<p>BEIRUT, Lebanon, Oct. 21 (UPI) -- Thousands of Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon and Syria swarmed into the streets Saturday, calling on Arab
leaders meeting in Cairo to immediately sever all contacts with Israel 
and
back the al-Aqsa intifada (uprising) in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
In
Beirut, Lebanese demonstrators, mostly university students, marched 
towards
the Arab League office, waving Palestinian flags and placards 
denouncing
peace treaties concluded by some Arab countries with Israel. They 
placed a
placard on a donkey that read: "I believe in peace with the Jews,"
according to witnesses. 

<p>In the nearby refugee camp of Chatila, Palestinians burned an Israeli 
flag
as well as U.S.-made products and symbolic coffins of Israeli 
ambassadors
to Jordan and Egypt, the two Arab countries that have peace treaties 
with
the Jewish state. Several hundred Palestinian protestors demonstrated 
in
the refugee camps of Ein el-Helweh and Rashidiyeh in southern Lebanon 
where
they set ablaze Israeli flags and an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud
Barak. 

<p>The representative in Lebanon of the Hamas Islamic militant body, 
Oussama
Hamadan, said the jihad (struggle) will continue until the liberation 
of
Palestine and pledged to take revenge on Israel for what he called its
massacres of Palestinians. In Syria, the Palestinian refugees staged a
protest in the Yarmouk shantytown near the capital, Damascus. They 
marched
inside the camp, shouting for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to expel 
the
Israeli ambassador to Egypt and holding up pictures of al-Aqsa mosque 
in
Jerusalem and others reading, "Let's severe all ties with the Zionist
enemy" and "Farewell Oslo (peace accords) and go to Hell." (Thanaa Imam

<H3>MIAMI, US

<p>Florida Protesters Rally for Palestinians <br>
(Reuters, 21 October 2000)</h3>

<p>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - More than 125 Islamic religious leaders,
community members and students from South Florida rallied on Saturday 
near
the city's Holocaust memorial to show their solidarity with 
Palestinians.
Supporters came in buses from as far away as 100 miles away to chant, 
pray
and voice their anger at the violence in the Middle East. Protesters
hammered "tombstones" into a grassy plot to make a point that the war 
is
affecting children. At one point in the rally a group of protesters 
raised
a child, draped in a Palestinian flag, over their heads as if he was 
dead.
"The immediate thing I want to see," said G. Murtaza Kakli, president 
of
the Muslim Community of Palm Beach County, "is Israel withdraw soldiers
from the Palestinian area they are occupying at once." 

<p>Arab leaders angrily condemned Israel and declared solidarity with
Palestinians at a rare Arab League summit in Cairo on Saturday as four 
more
people were killed in fierce clashes in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
Three
teenagers were among the dead, scores of people were hurt and a 
13-year-old
youth was seriously wounded by a bullet to the head on a "day of rage"
called by militant groups after a U.S.-brokered agreement failed to 
stop
the violence. Saturday's fatalities took the death toll in more than 
three
weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence to 121, all but eight of them
Palestinians or Israeli Arabs.

<H3>MOMBASA, KENYA

<p>Anti-Israel protests rock Mombasa <br>
(Times of India, 21 October 2000)</h3>

<p>MOMBASA: Thousands of Muslim demonstrators marched through the streets 
of
Kenya's second biggest city to protest against Israel's role in the 
ongoing
violence in the Middle East. Chanting anti-Israel slogans, the
demonstrators brought Mombasa's lunch-time traffic to a standstill 
after
midday prayers on Friday. The marchers, in three groups totalling more 
than
5,000 according to police estimates, chanted the name of Osama bin 
Laden,
the Saudi Islamic underground leader wanted by the United States for 
the
August 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. 
Some
demonstrators carried placards to register their disgust over the 
failed
ceasefire accord this week by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Some placards read: "The Sharm 
el-Sheikh
Conspiracy. The Shame of the Sheikhs. Puppets of the West." One 
protester,
Mohammed Abdalla, told AFP: "We are chanting death unto Israel because 
the
UN only protects the rights of Jews and Christians." Women dressed in 
black
from head to toe also joined in the protest held in the predominantly
Muslim city on Kenyatta Day, a holiday commemorating Kenya's 
independence
heroes. (AFP)

<H3>SANAA, YEMEN

<p>Yemenis march for Palestine<br>
(SAPA, 21 October 2000)</h3>

<p>SANAA - Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis, most carrying weapons,
demonstrated on Saturday in the Yemeni capital in support of the
Palestinians, demanding strong decisions from the Arab summit, an AFP
reporter said. The official news agency Saba estimated the crowd at one
million people and the organisers put the number at 1.5 million, as 
similar
protests were reported across the country. In Sanaa, they called on 
Arab
leaders meeting in Cairo on Saturday and Sunday "to open the path to 
jihad
[holy war] against the Zionist enemy" and to "take strong decisions on 
the
Israeli force of occupation". 

<p>A committee led by parliamentary speaker and head of the Islamist 
Al-Islah
party, Sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, organised the protest. He strode out 
at
the head of the demonstration alongside several ministers, MPs and 
other
party leaders. "Our duty is to liberate Jerusalem," demonstrators 
chanted.
"No peace, no normalisation," they shouted, many carrying Kalashnikov
assault rifles, some copies of the Muslim holy book the Koran. Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh called at the opening of the Arab summit 
for
an international force to be set up to protect the Palestinians on the 
West
Bank and Gaza Strip. He also urged fellow Arab leaders to lift 
sanctions
that have been imposed on Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in 1990. 

<p>"I am for international forces to ensure the protection of women and
children" in the Palestinian territories, where more than 120 people 
have
been killed since clashes erupted with Israeli forces on 28 September, 
he
said. Saleh also said the Arabs should provide military and financial 
aid
to the Palestinians. "I am for jihad, for resistance, for arms and 
money to
be sent to fight the Jews and not for [verbal] condemnations," the 
Yemeni
leader said. - Sapa-AFP

<H3>NEW YORK, US
<p>Demonstrators call for Arabs to cut ties to Israel<br>
by Mohamad Bazzi (Newsday.com, 21 October 2000)</h3>


<p>Calling for Arab leaders to cut ties with and boycott Israel, about 150
pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched Friday outside the Israeli 
Consulate
and the Arab League offices in Manhattan.

<p>The rally took place on a day when the Palestinian-Israeli truce 
brokered
by President Bill Clinton appeared to have collapsed after as many as 
10
Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in clashes across the West 
Bank.

<p>It was the smallest in a series of rallies organized by Arab-Americans 
and
other Palestinian supporters since violence broke out in the Middle 
East
three weeks ago. Last Friday, more than 15,000 Arab-Americans marched 
on
the United Nations after holding an outdoor prayer service.

<p>Organizers of Friday's protest geared their demands to an emergency 
summit
of Arab leaders in Cairo set to begin Saturday.

<p>"We do not want Arab countries buying Israeli products when the 
Israelis
continue to kill Palestinians," said Mary Nazzal, 21, a
Palestinian-American and a student at Columbia University.

<p>Out of the 22 members of the Arab League, only Egypt and Jordan have 
formal
ties with Israel. Other Arab countries like Morocco have informal ties.

<p>Echoing recent protests in many Arab capitals, the New York 
demonstrators
called for severing all ties with Israel and for a broad boycott of 
Israeli
products.

<p>A spokesman for the Israeli Consulate said those wanting peace should 
focus
on restarting negotiations.

<p>"We hope that all parties interested in peace will do everything in 
their
power to make a positive contribution to the restoration of calm on the
ground, rebuilding trust between their leaders and returning their 
parties
to the negotiating table," said spokesman Yehuda Yaakov.

<p>The demonstrators, standing behind police barricades outside the Arab
League offices on Third Avenue and 46th Street, also directed their 
anger
at Arab leaders. They chanted in Arabic, "The Arab traitors must fall."
"Come down from your comfortable offices and join us," shouted Aisha
Ibrahim, 76, a Palestinian immigrant who lives in New Jersey. "How can 
you
just sit there when our children are being murdered?" The two-day Cairo
summit will seek a joint stand against what Arabs see as Israel's 
failure
to honor deals with the Palestinians and its excessive use of force to
quell three weeks of protests in which at least 115 people have died, 
the
majority of them Arabs.

<p>Marchers held aloft pictures of Palestinians killed, including Mohammed
al-Durra, the 12-year-old boy fatally shot before news cameras while he
sought shelter in his father's arms.

<p>"Our youths only have stones," said Samia Halaby, a 
Palestinian-American
from Brooklyn. "But they are still fighting for their land."

<H3>CHICAGO, US

<p>Protest Outside Israeli Consulate Decries anti-Palestinian Violence <br>
(Chicago Tribune, October 21, 2000)</h3> 

<p>More than 1,500 Palestinian activists gathered downtown Friday to
demonstrate against the ongoing conflict between Israelis and 
Palestinians
in the Middle East. Organizers said the rally was designed to show
Palestinian unity and to urge the U.S. government to rethink its
pro-Israeli position. The protesters gathered outside Tribune Tower, 
waving
Palestinian flags and holding signs denouncing Israel's role in the
violence. At 5 p.m. the protesters marched across the river to the 
Israeli
consulate, 111 E. Wacker Drive, where they stood in the street and 
chanted.
"We want peace and we want to show our solidarity," said Navade Khader, 
a
21-year-old student at DePaul University. "This rally is full of 
Indians,
Palestinians, Afghanistanians, African Americans, and so many others. 
They
are all here because they believe what Israel is doing is unjust." The
rally, the third this month, ended with several speeches from 
Palestinian
and Muslim leaders. Organizers said it likely would be the last of its
kind. "We feel that we have gotten our message across," said Raeed 
Tayeh,
the event's coordinator. "Now we need to do more at the practical 
level. We
need to unite to urge our Congressmen that they should stop funding
Israel's attacks on our people."

<H3>LEICESTER, UK</H3>

<p>As part of the ongoing campaign against injustice in Palestine, UK
organisation Friends of Al-Aqsa organised three demonstrations, in
Leicester, Bolton and Swansea. All three passed off peacefully; the 
officer
in charge of the police operation in Leicester praised the conduct of 
the
5000-strong Muslim protesters, calling the whole day, “brilliant”.

<p>The Chairman of Friends of Al-Aqsa, Ismail Patel, was elated at the
response of the community to the crisis in Palestine. “Muslims in three
cities of Britain have shown today that they care about the struggle 
for
justice in Palestine,” he said, “and they have done so in a way that
illustrates the Islamic concern for the rights and property of others 
in
every respect.” When asked what the organisation will do next, he said 
that
it all depends on how the crisis develops. “We shall use all legal 
means
necessary to liberate Al-Aqsa Mosque from the yoke of Zionism and to 
obtain
justice for our brothers and sisters. Don’t forget, Palestinians have 
spent
the past 52 years oppressed by a country sponsored and armed by Western
governments.” Where, he asked, is the British government’s “ethical 
foreign
policy” over Palestine?

<p>Speakers at the Leicester rally included Sheikh Riyadh ul Haq who told 
the
enthralled audience of the need to defend Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque
against Zionist aggression. “Religion cannot be taken out of the 
equation
when discussing this issue,” he said, “the rabbis of Israel have made 
their
position clear for all the world to see: they regard the lives of
Palestinians – Muslims and Christians alike – as less valuable than 
those
of Jews, and thus expendable.” This, added Sheikh Riyadh, is 
unacceptable
and everyone, of whatever faith, should campaign against such racist
attitudes.

<p>It was also pointed out by Ismail Patel that if the Palestinians were
‘black’, the USA and Europe would be leading the call to dismantle the
apartheid state of Israel. However, because Palestinians are Arabs, and
mostly Muslims, Western taxes pay for Israel’s oppressive policies. The
marches were silent to convey the message that: Muslims show respect 
for
all who have lost their lives, men, women and children; Palestinian
children have been cruelly silenced; World leaders have largely been 
silent
about the Palestinian cause and the human rights abuses committed by 
the
only so-called democracy in the region. Coffins were carried by 
marchers at
the front of the demonstration, symbols of the young lives cut short by
Israeli bombs and bullets.
