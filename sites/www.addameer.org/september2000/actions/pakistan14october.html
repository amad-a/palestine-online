Palestine massacre: Pak protesters hold Clinton responsible </H2>

(The Independent (Pakistan), 14 October 2000)
<p>
KARACHI, Oct 14: Pakistani Muslims on Friday torched an effigy of US
President Bill Clinton and protested over Israeli gunship attacks on
Palestinians, police and witnesses said, reports AFP.About 100 
activists
from the radical group National Islamic Front (NIF), staged a rally in 
an
industrial district of southern Karachi, witnesses said, chanting 
slogans
against Israeli forces and burning Clinton's effigy."Clinton is 
responsible
for the murder of Palestinian people," said NIF leader Usman
Siddiqui.Political and religious leaders joined forces around Pakistan 
to
condemn the "atrocities" committed by Israeli forces over the last two
weeks as the Mideast crisis escalates.

<p>Meanwhile, clerics urged Muslim countries, particualrly those in the 
Arab
world to settle their differences and formulate a united policy to 
counter
"Israeli aggression." "Jehad (holy war) is (a) must against Israel," 
Mufti
Jamil, a central leader of the fundamentalist Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam 
party
said."Why there has been so much hue and cry against the killing of 
three
Israeli soldiers when the world remained silent over the genocide of so
many Palestinians," Ghafoor Ahmed, a senior leader of the 
Jamaat-i-Islami
party asked.

<p>On Thursday, the Israelis fired rockets on Ramallah, Gaza City and 
Jericho
after a Palestinian crowd lynched to death Israeli soldiers in
Ramallah.Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in a letter to 
Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said: "Our prayers are with you as you lead the
Palestinian people to face this new challenge."Bhutto, who lives in
self-exile in London, called for a "quick and just" action by the
international community to restore peace, her party here said.Pakistani
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar on Friday condemned "the Israeli use of 
heavy
arms and air power against the Palestinian people and civilian targets 
in
Ramallah and Gaza.""Israel must immediately cease all aggressive 
attacks
and abide by the Security Council resolution of October 6, calling for
(the) cessation of violence and resumption of negotiations for an early 
and
final settlement of the Middle East issue," he added.Nearly two weeks 
of
violence in the Mideast has so far claimed more than 100 lives, leaving 
a
peace initiative hanging by a thread.Diplomatic hopes to defuse the 
crisis
are pinned on a summit that could take place in Egypt as early as 
Saturday.
