<H2>   15,000 Rally Against Israeli Actions</H2>









<p> 
By JOSH GETLIN (LA Times, 14 October 2000)

<p>NEW YORK--More than 15,000 people marched to the United Nations on 
Friday
to protest Israel's crackdown on Palestinian demonstrators and to urge
President Clinton and others to take a balanced approach to the Mideast
dispute. 

<p>The noisy but peaceful rally, which included grocers, cab drivers,
teachers, religious leaders, activists and others from the Muslim
community, filled Dag Hammerskjold Plaza. Many displayed grisly photos 
of
children killed in confrontations with Israeli soldiers; others waved
Palestinian flags and chanted angry slogans. 

<p>Similar but smaller rallies were held Friday in the Southland. The New 
York
gathering lasted five hours and was notable for the absence of 
political
VIPs--such as First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York Mayor 
Rudolph
W. Giuliani--who attended a similar rally here Thursday for Israel. The
irony was not lost on organizers. 

<p>"Of course we feel neglected and overlooked by American politicians," 
said
Akhmed al Hatib, president of the National Muslim Merchants Assn. "But
politicians and the media must remember--we vote and we do not forget." 

<p>Many New York-area mosques closed for the day, enabling members to 
attend
the event. Some protesters came on buses from as far as New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and upstate New York. 

<p>Pausing twice during the rally for afternoon prayers, many participants
expressed anger over news stories about the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict.
The reporting "is not to be believed, because we are criticized, and we 
are
not the ones shooting children," said Nisreen el Hashemiate Mohamed, an
activist. 

<p>To change U.S. foreign policy, speakers said, Palestinians and other
Muslims must increase their economic and political clout. That means 
voting
in greater numbers and making sure that their voices are heard, said 
Siraj
Wahaj, the imam from the Al Daqwaa mosque in Brooklyn. 

<p>"This is the only way the government will ever be evenhanded in the way 
it
treats Palestinians and Israelis," he said. "But there is another 
lesson we
must never forget: You fight back when someone hurts you. You never 
give
up. And sometimes, brothers and sisters, you fight to the death." 

<p>In the Southland, about 100 Arab Americans rallied in front of the 
Ronald
Reagan Federal Building in downtown Santa Ana for about three hours 
Friday
afternoon. They chanted slogans such as "Stop the killing, stop the 
crime,
save the children of Palestine." 

<p>About 35 Santa Ana police with helmets and gas masks at the ready had
expected a crowd of as many as 1,000 protesters. They surrounded the
smaller group, and no disturbances were reported. An Arab American 
march
that attracted 600 people in Riverside on Friday also was peaceful, 
police
said.
