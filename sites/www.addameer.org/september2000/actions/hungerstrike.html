    Report from Washington DC Hunger Strike </H2>









<p>
  
 

Dear Friends: 

<p>The Hunger Strike in front of the White House ended at 8 AM Friday 
morning. We had a candle light vigil yesterday evening where members 
of the Washington, DC area with the support of the ADC came to show 
their support for the children of Palestine, 

<p>The morale over this past week was pretty high, and the strikers were 
determined to getting the message through despite all the restrictions 
imposed on us by the secret service and the park police, and the 
blackout of the media. 

<p>The support from the local DC community was great, people dropped in 
all the time to show their support and solidarity. The nights were 
special where people would come and spend their evenings with us in 
Lafayette Park. We would share hot water and sugar together and sing 
the 70s and 80s patriotic songs. "Ish-had ya 3alam ya 3alaina o 3a 
beirut" and "bism il 7orriyya" brought back some dear memories and 
lifted up our spirits. 

<p>Unfortunately, the strike didn't receive the media coverage it 
deserved. There was a total blackout by the media on this issue. None 
of the major papers or News agencies bothered to check or report on 
what was going on despite the numerous calls they have received. 
European media has been more responsive however, so was the Arabic 
one. We had coverage from Canada, Ukraine, Germany, France, Abu Dhabi, 
ART, MBC, Aljazeera, and Al-Ssafeer. CNN finally showed up last night 
for the vigil. 

<p>The Secret service and the park police developed a belligerent 
relationship with us, they didn't spare a moment to come harass us and 
restrict our activity and movement. A threat of arrests and permit 
provocation was made at more than one occasion. 

<p>Tourist groups from as far as China, Japan, Bosnia, France, Spain, 
Italy, several US states, and many other countries have come forward 
to speak with us and show us their support. 

<p>Last night we were visited by a group representing the Churches for 
Peace in the Middle East. They presented us with roses and a letter of 
support from the all the churches they represent. Moreover yet, they 
will issue a call to all their members to join us in our fast 
tomorrow, 11-4. 

<p>The letters of support we have received kept us focused and determined 
to take this struggle till the end. Thank you to everyone who sent an 
email of support and to all of you who had kept us and the palestinian 
people at these times in their minds. 

<p>Although we ended our hunger strike today and have left Lafayette 
Park, tomorrow is still going to be an international day of a 
solidarity fast with the Palestinian people. We urge all the peace 
loving people to join us in this day and remember the children of 
Palestine. Please spread the word out and inform your friends and 
acquaintance of why are you fasting. 

<p>Thank you for all your support. <br>
We Shall Return
