<p><B>No Smile this Morning - my notes</B>


<p>
Thu, 16 Nov 2000

<p>Dear Colleagues,

<p>Those of you who have visited my office during the past years will,
most probably, remember Abu- Jad.  Yes, he is the janitor at our
Ministry who is in charge of cleaning our Department and making
coffee. Many of you have said to him, and to me, that he made the
best
coffee in Palestine.

<p>Normally, I get to work in the morning around 7:45 a.m. Every
morning,
I would find Abu-Jad there ahead of me. He would have, by that
time,
cleaned our offices and brewed the morning coffee. As soon as I
enter
into my office, he would follow me, greeting me with his pleasant
smile and a fresh cup of his delicious strong coffee. He arrives to
work at 7:00 a.m. He is very hard working, organized, punctual and
very clean. He has a strong sense of belonging to the Ministry. He
takes pride in his work and is very pleased to get compliments
about
his good work, especially from our visitors. He is a great asset to my
Department. When he takes a leave from work, even for a day, I feel
handicapped without his coffee and without the quick service he
provides to my daily numerous visitors.

<p>Today, I got to work as usual, before 8:00 a.m. My office was still
closed. There was no smell of Abu-Jad's coffee. I was not surprised.
Today seems to be one of the worst days since the beginning of Al Aqsa
Intifada in terms of Israeli-imposed closure on Ramallah and on other
cities, towns, refugees and villages. Normally, the Israeli army has
roadblocks on the roads leading to Ramallah. Palestinians use
alternative dirt roads to get in. We always feel that the Israeli army
knows about the dirt roads, but does not close them. Today, the army
has put heaps of dirt and rocks on dirt roads.

<p>Abu-Jad got to work at 9:10 a.m., more than two hours late. He left
home at the same time he does every morning but had to get out of the
shared taxi from his village (Beit 'Anan) at each heap of dirt and
walk to catch another taxi to the next heap. He did this several times
in order to reach the Ministry. He spent more than two hours getting
here (normally it takes him 20 minutes), and much more money. He was
already exhausted, psychologically and physically.

<p>He came to greet me, with the delicious cup of coffee, but without the
daily pleasant smile. He was worried about the way back home and about
his daughter who, also, commutes to Ramallah  daily to study at
women's technical college next door to our Ministry. Later on, he told
me that he was pleased to hear from home that his daughter was safe at
home. She did not succeed to leave the village, as he did, to go to
Ramallah. She did study, yet he was pleased that she was safe.

<p>Three out of eight of my colleagues in our Department did not make it
to work today. Two came very late, like Abu-Jad. When I asked about
other colleagues at the Ministry, I was told that more than 60% were
absent. Most government schools in Ramallah whose students come from
surrounding areas had similar rates of absence today.

<p>Abu-Jad left work very early today hoping to find transportation back
to his village.  I wonder if I will see him on Saturday.
