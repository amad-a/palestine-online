<p> Shooting in our Backyard<br>
 By Siham Al Masri<br>
 (15 years old)<br>
 Ramallah

 <p>They call it another Intifada, and perhaps it
 is, but how does it affect us? We go to bed
 hearing shooting and helicopters hovering
 overhead, and we wake up to see Israeli
 soldiers just yards from our homes, killing
 Palestinians in cold blood and depriving us of
 every human right to which we are entitled,
 whilst blaming us for the situation and making
 us look like the villains. So, how does it
 affect us? In short, it makes us angry. Can you
 blame us?

 <p>All over Palestine, Palestinian villages and
 cities are facing the same brutality and the
 same acts of violence, and I ask you, what on
 earth can  justify the murder of innocent
 Palestinian children? What kind of logic can
 possibly explain all this killing and cruelty?
 No wonder I am sad and angry! My friends, be
 they in Jerusalem, Ramallah, Nablus, Tulkarem,
 Qalqilya or Gaza are all suffering. We all want
 justice, but nobody seems to be doing anything
 to stop the bloodshed, so it is only natural
 that we are gradually despairing, believing
 that that light at the end of the tunnel that
 so many once spoke of is becoming more and more
 distant.

<p> I used to hear my parents talk about the wars
 they had been through, but I never really
 thought that I would go through one myself,
 yet, here we are, facing what is by all
 accounts a war situation. Some would argue
 otherwise, saying that this isn't a war, but I
 would like to ask them: How do you define war?
 Isn't war a term for a situation whereby
 innocent people including children are killed
 by a foreign occupier? Isn't it war when
 Israeli soldiers shoot at Palestinians too
 young to understand the 'crime' for which they
 are being punished? Yes, the Palestinians are
 throwing stones - do you blame them? - but how
 many Israelis have died or even been seriously
 injured as a result of being hit by a stone,
 and how can anyone justifying punishing those
 responsible for throwing them by killing them?

<p> I was an eyewitness to some of the shootings
 that took place and I know for a fact that many
 of the Israeli bullets were directed not
 towards people in the street, but towards
 Palestinian homes. I myself was in my house in
 Beitunia when I saw Israeli bullets penetrate
 the walls of my neighbor's building. How am I
 supposed to feel after witnessing such a thing,
 and how am I supposed to have faith in a peace
 process that cannot even promise me safety
 within the confines of my own home or a good
 night's sleep for my younger siblings who are
 being woken up every night by the sound of
 light bombs being fired in our neighborhood?
 How can I be expected to convince a tiny child
 that everything will be okay when I am not
 convinced myself?

<p> Even attempting to save someone's life seems to
 have come to be considered a crime by the
 Israeli soldiers who do not hesitate in firing
 at ambulances and first-aid teams as they go
 about their business. With this in mind, I find
 it impossible to believe that we should
 continue to negotiate with the State of Israel,
 which, from my point of view, has stooped to an
 all-time low in its treatment of the
 Palestinian people. No, on the contrary, we
 should have no dealings with the Israelis
 whatsoever. It is they who are terrorists, and
 it is they who are killing every hope of peace.

<p>A Stone Hurts BUT a Bullet Kills<br>
  By Nadine Abu Ata<br>
  14 years old<br>
  Jerusalem, Palestine
<p><br>
<p> Not long ago the extreme right wing Israeli
 leader, Ariel Sharon visited the Holy Aqsa
 Mosque in Jerusalem accompanied by some three
 thousand Israeli soldiers. Due to his visit,
 many Arabs worldwide felt obliged to take
 action to protect the sanctity of the Holy
 Mosque and that of Jerusalem. Some might ask,
 "Could it really be that this one visit caused
 all this trouble?" Well, the truth is, that it
 was not the visit itself that resulted in such
 chaos, but rather the fact that it served as a
 reminder that the Palestinians can no longer
 put their faith in the so-called peace process,
 which, for the past eight years, has been
 unsuccessful in fulfilling the hopes and
 ambitions of the Palestinian people. In short,
 the visit simply obliged us to wake up from our
 dream and accept the fact that our lives are
 constantly being jeopardized.

<p> Imagine how Palestinians in general and
 Palestinian youth in particular feel right now,
 knowing that the Israeli occupier remains
 intent on destroying their hope of a better
 future, challenging our attempts to live in
 peace and security and killing those we love.
 As a Palestinian youngster, I am well aware of
 the fact that my life is in danger, so how
 should I cope with such a realization? How can
 I encourage others to be optimistic when I know
 that the danger to our lives is as real as ever
 before?

<p> The recent clashes involved a fully armed
 Israeli army - one of the most heavily armed
 armies in the world - and Palestinian civilians
 who, in the vast majority of cases, possessed
 nothing but stones. Tell me, I beg you, what
 match are Palestinian  stones for Israeli tear
 gas canisters, live and rubber bullets and
 tanks? Israeli snipers aim at the hearts and
 heads of innocent Palestinians, so how can we
 possibly carry on having faith in the so-called
 peace process? Am I supposed to ignore what I
 see on TV, to ignore the fact that the children
 who are dying had as much right to reach
 adulthood and lead normal lives as other
 children throughout the world? Like my friends,
 I have come to the realization that losing
 one's life in this country has become an
 ordinary thing, and that makes me afraid -
 afraid of what occupation is doing to me, my
 family, my friends, and to Palestinians all
 over the county.

<p> I am acquainted with some Israeli youngsters
 who inevitably find excuses for what the
 Israeli soldiers and government are doing. They
 say, for example, that the soldiers are merely
 defending the Land of Israel, while one went so
 far as to suggest that if I didn't like what
 was happening, I would be wise to move with all
 the other Palestinians to one of the many Arab
 countries in our region, bearing in mind that
 the Israelis have nowhere to go except 'Eretz
 Israel'. Could it possibly be that, after all
 this time, Israelis have still failed to come
 to terms with the fact that this is OUR
 country?

<p> Returning to the demonstrations of support on
 the part of certain groups of people in various
 Arab countries, yes, it is nice to see them
 stand by the Palestinians and voice their
 opinions by demonstrating and trying to show
 the media and the world the truth. It is good
 to know that others are ready to defend the
 Holy Land, which is considered sacred by all
 Palestinians, be they Muslims or Christians.
 But, the fact remains: the Palestinians are
 still dying, while those still alive have come
 to believe that there is no way out of the
 terrible situation we are facing except to
 sacrifice our lives, hoping that the media and
 the international community will eventually
 come to realize the full extent of our
 suffering and put pressure on Israel to bring
 it to an end.

<p> A stone can hurt, it is true, but, the fact is,
 that Israeli soldiers are shooting not to
 defend themselves, but in order to kill as many
 Palestinians as possible, and it is this fact
 upon which the world should now concentrate.

<a name="saleem"></a>
<p> The Shattered Dream<br>

 Saleem Habash<br>
 (18 years old)<br>
 The Youth Times)<br>
 Ramallah


<p> I once believed in peace. I even took part in
 the efforts to help it materialize, truly
 believing that the day would soon come when
 peace would prevail all over the world. Yes, I
 believed in peace, and I dreamt about it every
 night*but as everyone knows, dreams have a
 nasty habit of never coming true, and now, I no
 longer dream of peace. Why? Because even as I
 write, I hear the sound of shooting, and no
 matter how hard I try, I can't get the sound of
 the 'zaghrouteh' of a martyr's mother out of my
 head.

<p> Many young Palestinians had dreams similar to
 mine. Asel Aseli, 17, for example, dreamt of
 peace. In fact, he was shot whilst wearing a
 Seeds of Peace T-shirt. This same T-shirt in
 which he was buried, was about to be delivered
 to around 300 other youngsters whom he was
 hoping would, with a little encouragement, soon
 come to believe in his idea of peace. He lived
 in Arrabeh, a Palestinian village  in what is
 now known as Israel, and it was there that he
 endured the bitter life of an Arab-Israeli, a
 life marked by discrimination and an inability
 to have at least the voice of a minority, in
 spite of the fact that the Arabs in Israel
 account for more than 25 percent of the overall
 population. When Asel was killed, his dream was
 killed too, as was mine*

<p> Another story that helped in dispelling the
 myth called peace is that of 12-year-old
 Mohammed Al-Dorrah, who died whilst taking
 shelter behind his father, Jamal. Sadly, the
 huge amount of live ammunition being fired in
 their direction made it impossible for Jamal to
 fulfill his fatherly duty and protect his son,
 who died in his lap amidst the voices of
 reporters, standing but a few meters away, and
crying trough their tears, "The boy has died,
 the boy has died." What was Mohammed's crime?
 Accompanying his father whilst he tried to gain
 a fair price for the family car, which he had
 been obliged to put up for sale in order to
 secure the school expenses of Mohammed and his
 brothers and sisters.

<p> Yet another story, another child*Sara Abdel-Haq
 was only two years old when Israeli bullets
 shattered her skull as her father and cousin
 were driving her to hospital for treatment for
 a lung infection. The cousin, who was also
 shot, survived, but Sara died. She, too, has
 helped in spreading the truth.

<p> Other stories*other children*other martyrs*yet
 the tears are all as bitter. To date, 90
 Palestinians have died in the 'days of anger',
 whilst some 3,000 - 40 percent of whom are
 under the age of 18 - have been injured. It is
 ironic that Israel, a country that has signed
 the Convention of the Rights of the Child, sees
 nothing wrong in pointing its guns at innocent
 children, children who appear to have no rights
 whatsoever, least of all the right to live, and
 whose lives are characterized by fear and pain,
 which is gradually turning into anger.

<p> Right now, the 11th day of the 'days of anger',
 our lives are at a standstill. The gates of our
 schools and universities remain closed, as do
 those of the vast majority of Palestinian shops
 and factories. What this means, amongst other
 things, is that our children are being deprived
 of something that can never be replaced - their
 childhood. Even were the schools to open today,
 could the classmates of Mohammed Al-Dorrah be
 expected to return to their studies without
 displaying any signs of psychological torment
 after seeing the footage of the last moment's
 of their friend's life and then his
 cold-blooded murder over and over again?

<p> Over the past 11 days, the Israelis have
 violated the rights of Palestinian children
 according to the Convention on the Rights of
 the Child in several ways. Looking at Article
 54 of the Convention, however, I realized that
 the various violations could be summarized in
 one, namely, the violation of a child's right
 to life. That right has been taken away from
 the Palestinian children, and here I refer not
 only to those who have died, but also to those
 who still live, for all of them are fighting in
 order to survive, if not the Israeli bullets,
 then certainly the fear and anguish that haunts
 them every minute of the day.

<p> We, the Palestinians, young and old, are sick
 of the huge 'joke' that Israel and the rest of
 the world seems intent on playing on us, which
 is why I say to the international community,
 listen to the pleas of Palestinian children and
 stop Israeli guns from shedding more blood NOW!
 If - and I hope this is not the case - my words
 have failed to move you, then take another look
 at the footage of Mohammad Al-Dorrah as he dies
  in his father's lap and remember that you are
 looking not at a criminal, not at a terrorist,
 but at an innocent, 12-year-old child. Can you
 hear us now?

<p> "Gaza Bends Only to God"

<p> By: Tareq Shehadeh<br>
  (16 years old)The Youth Times<br>
  Gaza
<p><br>
<p> I am a 16-year-old boy from Gaza. I lived
 through the Intifada, and now I am living
 through the so-called state of peace, yet like
 before, my eyes are full of tears and my head
 of terrible news. I ask you, what difference is
 there between the Intifada years and now?

<p> We, the people of Gaza, did enjoy a period of
 peace and tranquility, but no longer. No,
 suddenly, everything changed, and now we go to
 sleep to the sound of the ambulances racing
 along our streets and the sound of shooting and
 the helicopters above our heads, so close that
 we can see their occupants clearly. The world
 is far away from these things, yet I live only
 five kilometers from the Martyrs' Junction, the
 scene of but one of many Israeli massacres, and
 while the world listens about what is going on
 here on the radio or watches it on TV, I
 actually live through the events that provide
 the world with so much entertainment.

<p> It certainly doesn't appear that the recent
 wave of clashes is about to end. On the
 contrary, people say that the number of bullets
 fired over the past five days exceeds the
 number shot during the entire Intifada. All we
 are doing is asking for our rights - nothing
 more, nothing less - but look at the Israeli
 response! An Israeli commander, for example,
 said the following: "The one who stands under
 the rain will get wet." But what about all the
 innocent people, men, women, and children, who
 got wet whilst not even standing in the rain?

<p> I want to know, will my younger brother learn
 to understand why my father has let his beard
 grow, or why my mother buries her head in her
 hands and cries? What horrible crime did my
 sister, who wakes up every night and cries for
 her mother, commit?
<p> Let the world come and see what is happening to
 us, and let it come now. Let it see for itself
 how the hospitals in Gaza are full of wounded
 and are no longer able to accept new patients,
 of which there are many, thanks to the Israeli
 soldiers who beat up people in their homes and
 attack everyone in sight, even innocent
 journalists.

<p> Whoever said that the people of Gaza don't want
 peace is a liar! They - including my relative,
 who was unable to bury his martyred son because
 of the closure, yes, even him - all want peace,
 but they want a just peace, not the kind of
 peace that makes men cry, those same men who
 now say to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
 "Gaza bends only to God."

<p> My Eyesight is the Price<br>
  By: Murad Bustami<br>
  The Youth Times<br>
  (19 years old)<br>
  Jerusalem
<p><br>
<p> In order to understand the extent of the eye
 injuries sustained during the recent clashes, I
 visited the Saint Joseph Hospital in Jerusalem,
 which specializes in treating eye problems.
 During my visit, I spoke to a few of the
 patients there, whose stories you can find
 below.

<p> Hashem Al-Salymeh, 29, from the Old City of
 Jerusalem, was shot in the eye during the
 recent clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque. "The Israeli
 soldiers, special squads and border police
 positioned themselves in the streets and
 alleyways of the Old City prior to the Friday
 prayer on 29 September," said Al-Salymeh. "As
 soon as the prayer ended, the soldiers started
 firing in all directions, making no distinction
 between men and women or young people and old
 people.  As I tried to assist the wounded, a
 rubber bullet hit me in my left eye, and now
 the doctors at St. Joseph tell that because it
 damaged my retina, there's a good chance I'll
 lose the sight in that eye."

<p> Al-Salymeh continued, saying, "By visiting
 Al-Aqsa Mosque, Sharon intended to refresh his
 memory of the massacres he committed against
 the Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila in
 Lebanon. As for the soldier who shot me, I have
 the following message: 'Don't laugh too hard.
 Although you are armed with all kinds of
 weapons, you have no just mission. Unlike you,
 we fight to defend our holy places, and
 although today is yours, tomorrow will
 definitely be ours.'"

<p> Omar Shalowdi, 31, who is also from the Old
 City of Jerusalem, became another victim of
 Israeli bullets. He told me, "On Friday 29
 September 2000 I was shot by a rubber bullet
 that damaged my retina and caused internal
 bleeding. I say to the soldiers, if you want to
 save Israeli lives, then you have to act in a
 legal way, not fire at innocent victims like
 you did at Al-Aqsa. It is totally unacceptable
 for you to violate the holiness of our holy
 places and provoke our people."

<p>Ahmad Fararjeh, 20, from Dheisheh refugee camp
 in Bethlehem was hit by three bullets, two in
 the eye and one in his arm. "A sniper fired at
 me twice during the clashes at the northern
 entrance of Bethlehem," said Fararjeh," who
 went on to say, "We will have our revenge,
 sooner or later."

 <p>Fararjeh, who praised the Palestinian Authority
 and its role in evacuating the wounded,
 concluded by saying, "I gave up the most
 precious part of my body for the sake of
 Al-Aqsa and I am ready to give up more for the
 sake of Palestine."

<p> Omar Diab, 26, was hit in the left eye by a
 rubber bullet. "One day Islam will reign
 victorious and regain control of the holy
 places," said Diab.  "I am ready to give more
 for the sake of Palestine and I ask the entire
 Arab and Muslim worlds to refrain from keeping
 silent when faced with the provocative Israeli
 measures and instead, to join us in fighting
 the occupation," he added.

 <p>Alla' Badran, 12, from the Old City of
 Jerusalem lost the sight in one of his eyes
 after being shot. Said Badran, "Whilst visiting
 my relatives in Qalandia, I went to fetch some
 things from a shop and was hit in the eye by a
 bullet." At this point, his mother interjected
 to say that only one day before the incident,
 Badran's five-and-a-half-year-old brother had
 been hit in the face by a rubber bullet.


<p> Khaled Khamis, 26, from Beit Ommar, Hebron, was
 also shot during the clashes at the northern
 entrance of Bethlehem. The bullet that hit him
 left him with both a broken nose and a damaged
 retina. "People have to fight," said Khamis,
 "knowing that whatever the soldiers do, they
 shouldn't be able to stop us."

<p> One of the nurses at the hospital noted that
 the number of casualties who arrived at the
 hospital on Saturday 30 September 2000 reached
 eight, and that of the eight, five lost the
 sight in one eye. She added that all of the
 wounded were hit by rubber bullets in the left
 eye.

<p> A Different Kind of Support<br>
 By: Dina Awwad<br>
 (17 years old)<br>
 The Youth Times<br>
 Beit Sahour


 <p>It is hard to convey my feelings concerning the
 current situation but I feel I need to try.
 After all, people are dying for their country,
 while their homes are being destroyed. As for
 the schools, they remain closed, and children
 are obliged to stay at home wondering when - or
 even if - they'll go back to school and,
 instead of studying, spent most of their time
 watching the news, trying to keep abreast of
 what is going on. Even as they do so, the
Israeli soldiers continue their attacks,
 sparing little or no concern for who they kill
or injure in the process: children, young men,
 old men, women, journalists*. these days, no
 one can consider himself excluded from the list
 of potential targets, not even a small child,
 surrounded by the arms of a parent.

 <p>People are afraid, and they don't know what to
 do, except hope that they don't lose their
 children or more of their land and that one
 day, the land they have already lost will be
 returned. Some 90 young men have already died
 in the recent clashes. How could that happen?
 How could the Israelis slaughter them like
 animals and get away with it? .

 <p>It is true that the Arab countries are
 supporting us by providing us with medical
 supplies, but we need another kind of support
 now, namely, political support, which, if
 comprehensive, should help us succeed in
 kicking the Israelis out of our homes and our
 land. That is what we need now, nothing more,
 nothing less.
