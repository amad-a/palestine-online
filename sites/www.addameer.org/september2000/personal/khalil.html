<p><B>Bantustanization and Decentralization - my notes</B>
<p>Dear Colleagues,

<p>I guess that if you are a senior official in a ministry of education
and want to sound  à la mode in educational management, then
you have
to say that you believe in and, preferably, work for decentralization.
For a person like me, the fund-raiser at the Ministry, it was always
a
delight to listen to my boss, the Deputy Minister, talk to donors
about our Ministry's efforts to move towards decentralization in
managing education . He did not  talk about the subject to please
donors. He, and senior Ministry officials, believed in it. In fact, it
is one of the major activities in our Ministry's Five-Year Educational
Development Plan for the period 2001-2005. We finished the final
draft
of the Plan just before Al Aqsa Intifada started. Almost all programs
and activities envisaged in the Plan, however,  are put on hold at the
moment, waiting for donors to fund them and for the present
situation
to ease up and to allow for their implementation. Decentralization,
however, did not wait for money. It went ahead at supersonic speed
because, ironically, the situation did not ease up but, rather,
worsened.

<p>In response to the closures and siege imposed by the Israeli army on
Palestinian cities, towns, villages and refugee camps, the Ministry of
Education put together an emergency plan to make it possible for
schooling to go on. In short, the emergency plan divides each of the
16 educational administrative districts in the West Bank and Gaza into
smaller geographical units. A unit is defined based on the roads and
availability of public transportation lines or ease and safety of
walking between population centers in each unit.  The District
Education Office assigns a coordinator for each unit from the school
principals, supervisors or district staff living in that area.
Whenever closure or siege is imposed on that area for more a long
period of time, the teachers who cannot reach their normal schools,
report to the nearest school to their area of residence. They teach
there and replace the missing teachers. Pupils do the same. They go to
the nearest schools and are helped by teachers in that school in their
studies. Volunteers from the local community in that area are called
upon to fill the shortage in teachers whenever it occurs.

<p>Qalqilya is one of the 16 educational administrative districts. The
city of Qalqilya has a population of 32,000. It has 9 government
schools, 7 private schools and 3 private schools. Outside the city of
Qalqilya, the district consists of 28 villages with 46 government
schools. Total number of pupils in government schools is 20,824.  The
Israeli army closed the major roads in the district and strictly
besieged the city since 8th November. Even dirt, side, roads leading
to the city are closed. This literally turned a number of geographical
areas in the district into Bantustans.

<p>The Director of Education in the district of Qalqilya, Mr. Mohammad
Alya, normally commutes to his office in the city from a village
(Irtah) in another district (Tulkarm). Although he tries every day, he
has not been able to reach his office since 8th November. He wisely
decided to implement the emergency plan which he has drawn. He and his
staff divided the District into 8 units, each with its own
coordinator. The coordinators redistributed teachers and located and
assigned volunteers. Had they not done this, 162 teachers would have
been sitting at home every day because they could not reach their
normal schools. Many pupils would have faced a similar fate. Now,
attendance of pupils is full. Around 99% of the teachers are working
in their normal schools or in alternative locations.

<p>Three of the employees of the central Ministry of Education in
Ramallah and a number of those from the Qalqilya District Office are
teaching in schools. Some of you may know one of these employees: Mr.
Amjad Masri. He is a computer engineer who works in the Instructional
Media Department at our Ministry. He is in charge of
World-Bank-sponsored project to link schools to the Internet (I*Earn).
He is presently teaching computer studies in one  of the schools in
Qalqilya city (Madrasat Al-Salam - School of Peace, in English).

<p>Volunteers from the local communities are of great help. Some of them
are newly-graduated university or high school students, presently
unemployed. Some are employees in other Ministries or institutions or
university lecturers or students who cannot report to their normal
work or studies. Some are retired teachers. Others are housewives. One
of the latter, teaches in the school village ('Atmeh). While she is
giving science lessons to pupils, her baby sleeps in the
administration room!

<p>I will not write to you in today's notes about the immense
difficulties that some of these teachers have to go through while on
their way to their daily work stations. I will not relate some of the
instances of humiliation at Israeli army roadblocks, especially near
the Israeli settlement of Alfei Menashe, which the Director of
Education narrated to me over the phone yesterday.

<p>Since he cannot reach his office, where does Mr. Alya go every day and
what does he do, you may ask.  Well, he uses the time to do something
he likes very much: visit schools in villages he can reach. He also
teaches some classes, sometimes whenever there is an emergent need.
The eight units are functioning relatively very well without his
direct intervention. He just receives reports from the coordinators;
gives guidance, feedback and directions; handles emergencies;
encourages people in schools  and raises their moral. He, even,  has
time to ask questions about and implement activities related to the
quality of schooling provided in his district. He managed to
reorganize a training course for schools principals on the integration
of curricular materials in grades 1-4, so that it is held in two
locations instead of one in order to accommodate the present
difficulties.

<p>The Bantustanization forced Mr. Alya to decentralize. It has forced
him to become, not only a manager who delegates and empowers his
employees, but also a potential educational leader. And he is only one
example,  out of many strongly determined educators and administrators
I could report about so far.
