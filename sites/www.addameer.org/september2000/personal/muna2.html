Dear Diary:
</P>

<P>
The electricity went out in the Bethlehem area between 7:00 p.m. -
11:00 p.m. Soon we found out that the Israeli army had bombed - or
fired at - an electric generator in Bethlehem. The Palestinian side
asked the Israeli side to provide protection - meaning not to shoot
at - Palestinian fire fighters so they could go in and put out the
flames which engulfed the generator. The Israeli side refused - of
course. 
</P>

<P>
How the electricity came back on at 11:00 p.m., we don't know but it
looks like the electricity just went out again in parts of Bethlehem
because both the radio and TV - which were both on - just went
silent. </P>


<P>
The black-out seemed to culminate the sense of deep depression we've
all been feeling since it was announced that Arafat was meeting with
Barak in Paris. So many of us could have bet that Arafat wouldn't do
it. Nobody here wants him to. </P>


<P>
And now the morning brings with it this heavy cloud of gloom. The
revolutionary songs and the sounds of the sirens outside, and the
reports about the clashes yesterday and last night - which resulted
in 7  additional deaths - aren't sounds that anger us. Rather they
are sounds and reports that push us forward, that make our blood
boil, allowing to feel angry enough to survive through another day. </P>


<P>
But reports of an agreement isn't something we can handle or want to
hear. So what if Israel pulls back its heavy artillery? They will
still use live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas to kill
innocent civilians. We will still wake up the next day in the
apartheid state we live in. And that's why the adamancy this time
around to see matters through. No one wants to go back to the
situation as it stood prior to al-Aqsa Intifada. </P>


<P>
As hard as these past few days have been, with a week feeling more
like an entire decade, people here are amazingly determined to fight
to the end. How can this momentum be allowed to subside????</P>


<P>
It was half-heartedly that I turned on the radio and TV this
morning, thinking that all the stations would be talking about the
agreement. Surprise..oh sweet, lovely precious, wonderful and
energizing surprise!!! </P>


<P>
Listening to the broadcasts you wouldn't think anything happened in
Paris last night. Interviews with various Fatah people, and Hamas,
and whoever else indicate that the battle is still alive. Everyone
interviewed is talking about the massacre against the Palestinians
and that the fight hasn't seen an end yet. </P>


<P>
The camp is so quiet this morning. Little movement outside. I went
out on the streets with a BBC reporter yesterday afternoon and it
was so calm. A few kids in my alley - 3 year olds - were playing a
war game, throwing pebbles at each other and firing toy guns.
Another group of 5 year olds were playing soccer with a flat soccer
ball....poor kids. 
</P>

<P>
The sound of radios and TVs emanated from the open windows and
blended in with the smell of fried tomatoes, boiled rice and fresh
baked bread......the sweet smells that gives the camp such a safe,
homey feeling. </P>


<P>
The high volume of the radio and TV startled me just now...so the
electricity is back on in Bethlehem. The radio announcer is
announcing that the PA has released 11 Hamas political prisoners
from its jails. What about the rest? 11 doesn't sound like the
correct figure of all political prisoners in PA jails!!!! </P>


<P>
Another correspondent is filing his reports about clashes and
demonstrations in the Bethlehem. I type as he speaks: </P>


<P>
"Last night in Bethlehem.....intense clashes in Rachel Tomb
area...heavy exchange of gun fire.....Israeli bullets penetrated
Palestinian homes and heavily damaged top floor of Paradise
hotel......four Israeli soldiers were wounded and an army chopper
evacuates them to Hadassah Hospital in West Jerusalem. An American
tourist was shot by Israeli gunfire near Tantur (opposite Bethlehem
check-point)....he's reported to be in critical condition....Israeli
soldiers also fired shots in the direction of Gilo settlement
(around corner from Bethlehem checkpoint).....</P>


<P>
Also last night in Beit Sahour, a 1-1:30 hour exchange of gun
fire....3 Israeli soldiers wounded.... Meanwhile at the Beit Jala
Tunnel, shots were fired by Palestinians at an Israeli bus. Driver
wounded.</P>


<P>
In the village of Husan (south of Bethlehem), severe confrontations.
2 Palestinians wounded by live ammunition....One of them in the
chest, one in the leg. </P>


<P>
Shot fired by armed Palestinians at the Israeli settlement of Bitar
Elit....settlers took to the streets and started pelting
Palestinians with stones...soldiers stormed into the village at
night and acted brutally with people....Shots also fired shots fired
by armed Palestinians at an Israeli military target in the village
of al-Khader (south of Bethlehem). </P>


<P>
Two Israeli tanks are now at Rachel's Tomb....high velocity Israeli
guns ready to use in al-Khader, Beit Sahour, Rachel Tomb, the Beit
Jala Tunnel, and the near the Israeli settlement of Efrat. </P>


<P>
Palestinian demonstrator set an Israeli settler car on fire in the
village of Husan.</P>


<P>
The Israelis are now ready to snipe the guys in Bethlehem because
several soldiers were injured during clashes in Bethlehem and Beit
Sahour.....and one soldier was killed in Beit Sahour....So the
Israelis are now out for revenge in Bethlehem....they're planning
something for Bethlehem. </P>


<P>
One Palestinian was killed in Hebron yesterday at 1 am when Israeli
under cover units, attempting to enter Palestinian territories,
fired at Palestinians and also at Palestinian homes. Exchange of gun
fire was also reported near Halhoul and in Yata (2 villages south of
Hebron). </P>


<P>
All this was from Radio Bethlehem 2000. 
</P>

<P>
I switch to Palestine Radio (government station). the reporter is
saying:</P>


<P>
"There is another martyr this morning in Jericho from wounds he
sustained the day before yesterday. 7 martyrs in the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and inside the Green Line yesterday and last night. Apache
choppers fired at demonstrators at Nitsarim junction in
Gaza.....they also fired LAW missiles. </P>


<P>
In Nablus this morning, a huge march called for by Palestinian
Women's Union this morning in Nablus. Loud speakers asking people to
head toward Israeli checkpoints.....the demonstrators are chanting:
"Abu Ammar (Arafat), Mr. President.....come home from Paris....to
the checkpoints young guys....the blood of the martyrs isn't
cheap...."</P>
 

<P>
Oh yes!!!! our people are coming through, they're holding on,
they're moving forward. No one wants agreements or "cease-fires" -
as if we're an army!!! They want to continue with the fight to the
end.
</P>

<P>
Thank God! I'm no longer depressed. The sun will shine today after
all. We're back to where we were, fighting up, standing up and
making our voices heard......</P>


<P>
Oh sweet smell of victory...could you be ours someday soon. Does a
people deserve it more than we do? It has been too long. 52 years of
aggression, of suffering, of sacrifice, of martyrs, of a life in the
Diaspora is too long....</P>


<P>
Perhaps this will be our last battle and our last war......it is
either our death or our liberation. There is no third way.....we
don't want a third way.</P>
