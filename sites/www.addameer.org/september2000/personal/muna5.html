Dear Diary:
</P>

<P>
Everyone woke up talking about Hizbullah's operation in Southern
Lebanon and their capture of three Israeli soldiers. It was the first
time in ten days that Palestinians here found something to smile
about. So what if the operation made Israel go crazy, threatening to
drag the entire area into a regional warfare? </P>


<P>
No one here is counting on the Arab states to take any action if
Beirut or Damascus are bombed. If they wanted to take action, as so
many people here in Dheisheh say, then they could have responded to
Israel's on-going massacre of the Palestinians by closing all Israeli
embassies, trade offices, or whatever they call them, in all the Arab
capitals that have ties with Israel. They could have also stopped
pumping oil to the West...for one week, or one month, to pressure
western governments into taking stern action.</P>


<P>
No one here counts on the Arab regimes, but they know - with their
eyes closed - that they can count on Hizbullah to masterfully plan an
operation and then carry it out. True, two Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon had to die in order for the operation to succeed, but such is
always the case when a people are fighting a war for freedom, for
existence.....death and destruction have to pave the way. </P>

  
<P>
The shooting death of Hasan Hassanein, 23, a Palestinian refugee from
Shatila refugee camp (shot in the chest & stomach), and Shadi Anas
from Bourj al-Barajneh refugee camp (shot in the heart), led to the
capture of the three soldiers and the rapid progress of events. By
nightfall yesterday (Oct. 7), Israeli tanks and artillery were
suddenly directed toward Palestinian towns, an exchange of gunfire was
heard in different parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli
settlers went on a vicious rampage against Palestinians in the West
Bank, Gaza and inside the Green-line, and Barak was suddenly giving
Arafat a 48-hour deadline to stop the al-Aqsa Intifada.  </P>


<P>
But if Barak really wants to know whether or not the Intifada will
stop, or can be stopped, he should talk to Palestinian women here,
rather than direct his threats to the Palestinian leader. Has Barak
wondered why Palestinian women are absent from the confrontation lines
this time around? With few exceptions here and there, and aside from
partaking in the funeral processions of martyrs, the women are staying
home. The obvious reason seems to be the fact that there are exchanges
of gunfire, making it unsafe for the women to be present.</P>
 

<P>
But the women are the unknown soldiers, the ones holding the fort in
every Palestinian household. They're the ones calming their kids and
tending to them while keeping their eyes glued on their TV screens. I
don't know a single woman in Dheisheh who isn't closely following
every single development. Even my 77 year-old mother-in-law sits in
her room with the radio always close to her ear. And all the women
talk about how they are unable to go about their everyday chores, that
they are not in the mood to clean, that they have lost weight in the
past ten days, that they suffer from headaches, that they can't sleep
well at night, that they are frightened for their husbands and their
children....</P>


<P>
And what do these women have to say to Barak? What do they have to say
about today's breaking news telling us that Israel and the
Palestinians have reached a cease fire agreement?</P>

 
<P>
"This Intifada must continue.....The death of our people isn't going
to be without results......let every Palestinian household give one
martyr and lets see this through to the end.....news of a cease fire
agreement depresses us; it isn't what we want to hear.....we can't
have an Intifada every few years and then slumber into a deep sleep
until we wake up again some years later to do it all over
again.....this time it has to be a fight till the end....till we
win.....</P>


<P>
Of course if Israel thinks it doesn't have a choice here, it certainly
does. It isn't a complicated choice but rather a choice which would
bring an end to the confrontations now and forever: Withdraw
completely from the entire West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem -
the territory it forcefully occupied in 1967; dismantle all Israeli
settlement in these territories; release all Palestinian political
prisoners from jail; recognize the right of return of Palestinian
refugees and enjoy the real fruits of peace resulting from the
establishment of a truly independent Palestinian state....rather than
the bantustan state Israel has been wanting to create.</P>
 

<P>
But this choice is still pre-mature for Israel apparently. It hasn't
used the full potential of its military might against the Palestinians
yet. And meanwhile, governments around the world have yet to put any
pressure on Israel. Can you imagine the U.S., and Britain bombing Tel
Aviv like they've bombed Baghdad? Can you imagine sanctions against
the government of Jerusalem? My oh my!!!!!! </P>


<P>
As the 48-hour deadline descends on us tomorrow, the Fateh Movement
(Tanzim Fateh) has issued a leaflet today calling for the Intifada to
continue. At 11:30 p.m. last night marchers walked through our camp's
alleys and then continued their march outside the camp. Churches in
the Bethlehem area rang their bells in unison around noon and a
sizable march called for by area churches marched through the streets.</P>


<P>
With schools back in session today, busloads from area schools
descended on Mustafa Farrarjeh's house to give their condolences to Um
Hazem. Pre-schoolers wearing green head-bands chanted as they walked
up to Um Hazem and shook her hand.....And tomorrow, all Dheisheh's
families who originally come from the village of Zakaryia - same
village that Mustafa Fararjeh came from - will come together and bring
food to the martyr's house to feed all those present. For three days
now, somebody has been bringing food to the family home....the first
day, food was delivered by the Palestinian Authority, the next day by
the Islamic Waqf, and today by the Fateh Movement.......such
solidarity, such support.</P>


<P>
And of course, none of us are able to leave the Bethlehem area yet.
For ten days, those of us who work in Ramallah, or Jerusalem, or
Hebron, or Israel, have been sitting at home...waiting,
watching....anticipating.</P>


<P>
And a general feeling persists.......we all feel that this fight this
time around is our very last with the Israelis. After 52 years of
resistance, dispossession and occupation, everyone is ready to either
witness  the total destruction of the land of Palestine, or the
emergence of a fully independent Palestinian state.......which path we
take is now Israel's choice.</P>
