Dear Diary:
</P>

<P>
I don't know what came over me this morning!!! For some reason, I
couldn't stop crying. I hardly could see the cups and plates I was
washing. Tears just kept blocking my vision. I started to slowly bang
my head against the cupboard and ask myself: what is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me? </P>


<P>
Was I crying because I was planning to go visit Akram Shafout in the
hospital today and was afraid of what I would see? Or was I crying
because of the bad dream I had last night about a close friend in Gaza
getting hurt? Or did the events of this past week finally catch up
with me and force me to lose my cool? Maybe it was all these reasons
combined. But the tears just wouldn't stop. Unable to sit at the
computer and write, I started to viciously scrub everything in sight,
the cupboards, the chairs, the floor.....everything in sight. </P>


<P>
Two hours later, I was physically exhausted and then the damn daily
headache was back to bother me some more. I tried to sleep but
couldn't. Sooner or later, no matter what I did, I had to go see Akram
in the hospital.</P>


<P>
And so I went with my friends Manal, Hanan and Amal. We walked up to
the third floor in the Intensive Care Unit at al-Hussein Government
Hospital in Beit Jala. As we approached the door, I spotted Abdullah,
Akram's cousin and my next door neighbor. I wanted to cry but didn't.
Abdullah looked exhausted standing there and greeting everyone who
came to see Akram. You can go in only two at a time, and please,
you're not allowed to speak to him, he told us. Hanan and Amal went in
first and came back out five seconds later. Hanan murmured something
about not being able to handle it. </P>


<P>
Then Manal and I walked in. It was a long hall and Akram's bed was in
the very far end. A screen blocked him from our view as we approached.
I felt my heart sink as he came into view. Tubes extended from his
mouth and nose and he wasn't awake. His right leg was in a cast and a
sheet covered his body, all the way up to his bare chest. Small spots
of perspiration filled his forehead. My lips began to shiver and so
did Manal's. All we could do was to murmur poor Akram! Hi body had
endured three surgeries, one after the next. One bullet had damaged
his kidney but a quick operation was able to save it. Another bullet
had totally destroyed his spleen, and he was operated on to remove it.
the third operation was to save his badly hit leg. According to the
doctors, if Akram had arrived at hospital five minutes later than he
did, he would have died of excessive internal bleeding. He lost so
much blood. </P>


<P>
Manal and I lingered at the foot of his bed, neither of us wanting to
leave. Then suddenly, Akram opened one eye and looked straight at me.
I waved and whispered hello. He nodded and closed his eye again. We
left him feeling so disheartened. </P>


<P>
Next we went to al-Manama Hospital near Dheisheh to visit Nasser,
another friend in Dheisheh who had gone through a serious surgery in
his spinal cord. A medical lab technician, and father of two, Nasser
was hurt during the gunfire exchange in Beit Sahour on Thursday,
October 5, 2000, only a few hours after Mustafa Fararjeh and Akram
Shafout were shot.  Though he had gone through a serious surgery for
four hours, Nasser was in very good spirits and very happy to see us.
He told us what happened:

<BLOCKQUOTE>This friend and I climbed up on the roof of a building and joined in
the exchange of gunfire. Within seconds, the Israeli army fired heavy
high-velocity machine gun fire in our direction. Instead of jumping
off the roof from the direction I had climbed, I jumped from the
opposite direction. I kept thinking 'I'll reach the ground now, I'll
reach the ground now'....but the distance was farther than I expected
on the that side of the building. I fell from a distance of 7 meters
and landed on my feet and started running. When we reached safety, my
leg started going numb and I started screaming from the pain.
apparently I hurt the nerve in my spinal cord and they decided to
operate on me right away so that I wouldn't become paralyzed. My
friends insisted on bringing a video camera and filming the entire
operation.</BLOCKQUOTE> </P>


<P>
Nasser laughed and started wiggling his toes. I'm OK now and I'm not
going to be paralyzed. </P>


<P>
We were planning to go visit the family of martyr Mustafa Fararjeh but
visiting Akram and Nasser left us so emotionally drained and we
postponed the visit till tomorrow. We opted to go to Manal's house for
coffee. All we could do was talk about the situation. Nobody wants the
situation to calm down if the Palestinians don't get any political
gains, but no one is optimistic that they are going to.</P>
 

<P>
As we sat there talking about the events of the past week, the TV
announcer interrupted his news show to say that Hizbullah fighters had
just kidnapped three Israeli soldiers, with their tank, in Shab'aa
farms in Southern Lebanon. We all cheered! We had heard the news about
the two Palestinian refugees in Lebanon who were shot dead by Israeli
troops during a demonstration at the Lebanese border and we  were so
proud of Hizbullah responding so quickly. Then the announcer said that
Israel was threatening to bomb Beirut and Damascus. Lebanon then
responded by asking Israel to release all Lebanese prisoners from its
jails.  </P>


<P>
The events have suddenly taken a different twist. Are we heading
toward a regional war? It all depends on how Syria and Lebanon will
respond if they're bombed by Israel. No one here expects the Arab
countries to respond to an Israeli aggression and the anger toward the
Arab regimes is immense...as it is toward the U.S. and the United
Nations.</P>


<P>
By 7:30 a.m., my headache had gotten terribly worse and I decided to
go to sleep. 15 minutes later, I awoke to the sound of a very heavy
exchange of gun fire. I laid in bed and listened. It sounded very
close, at the Beit Jala Tunnel near the village of al-Khader, only
some meters away from Dheisheh. The shooting persisted, off and on,
for nearly 40 minutes or more. In between, I could hear the sound of
long whistles and cheers coming from somewhere in Dheisheh. I smiled
in the dark. I was a kid in Amman, Jordan during the 1967 war, and
also a kid during the black September war in Jordan in 1970, and in
Palestine during most of the Intifada.....but this was the very first
time in my life ever that the sound of gunfire didn't frighten me. And
for the first time in my life I fully understood why the Palestinians
who've lived through occupation al their lives, have always gone out
and fought the Israelis.....facing their bullets with stones. I guess
after you live under oppression, brutality, and force for so long,
fear becomes your least concern. Rather, you think of wanting an end
to the atrocities, and Israel doesn't seem to understand any language
if it isn't the language of force. Perhaps the Palestinians will learn
from Hizbullah...and from the Vitenamese....just how to go about it.</P>
 

<P>
The shooting suddenly ceased. I couldn't sleep and realized that I
hadn't eaten all day nor written my diary entry.......</P>


<P>
I checked on the kids next door. Kholoud, 11, was in hysterics. She
doesn't sleep well at night and goes nuts when she hears the sound of
gunfire. The events of the past week have certainly left their mark on
the kids. The healing of the psychological scars that the kids have
been left with after watching the cold-blooded murder of Muhammed
al-Dura, will take a long time to heal. But then again, they will grow
up knowing that they have to carry on the struggle, until the
Palestinians are able to have anauthentic state and genuine peace.</P>
