<H3>Bare Chests</H3>

<p>
My guest for dinner was Larry Towell, a Canadian photographer.

With his professionalism and experience, he is famous in the world 
of

photojournalism. I came to know him during the first Intifada through

another friend who recommended him to me. At the time, it was his

first visit to Palestine, which attracted him by the pictures of

children fighting an army and challenging machine guns.
<p>

Palestinian enthusiasm affected him. With his camera in hand, he

roamed the streets and fields between settlements and army

garrisons. He took pictures of angry faces, sad tears, mournful

good byes, and a lot of stones.
<p>
When we departed last time, anger had caught on to him. He was

sad. Afterwards, he published a photo book telling the story of

heroism and arrogance, the song of freedom and guns of tyranny in a

great epic. One of the pictures in the book won a "picture of the

year" award.

<p>
Before coming to Palestine the second time, he asked me, "What

is going on over there? The whole world thought that you are very

close to peace and freedom." I tried to explain to him our anger,

humiliation, feeling of rebellion, and longing for a day of freedom,

even if it came one day before dying.

<p>
Larry came with his camera that seems to weave magic in his

hands. After touring the area for a few days, he said, "Nothing

changed. It is still the same faces behind the barricades shooting

bullets at freemen. It is still the same arms chasing dreams with

rocks." With sudden anger in his voice, he continued, "Don't you

Palestinians learn from your past experiences how to avoid defeat? Did

you not learn from your enemies how to achieve victory?"

<p>
"How?" I asked.
<p>

He put his camera aside and drank some water before saying,

"Why don't you invite youth from all over the world to your farms,

villages, and refugee camps? Why don't you establish Palestinian

Kibbutzes? Don't you know that Israel invites youth from all over the

world to visit their Kibbutzes? They make them offers to attract them

to come, and use their presence in two ways. First, they participate

in the work at the Kibbutz. Second, they fill their heads with Israeli

propaganda. Since its establishment, Israel has done this and has made

hundreds of thousand of people ambassadors for Israel in their

respective countries. Some of these people have become ministers,

parliamentarians, professors, or journalists."

<p>
Larry noticed that I was impressed by the idea. He looked at me

and I said, "this is a great idea."

<p>
With increasing anger, he shouted, "Did you wait for the likes of me

to tell you that you have a rich heritage of heroism, and that you

should think of how to win and not just fight, before more of your

young die?"

<p>
I replied, "how to win and not just fight. But our enemy is well

armed and America supports it. We don't have what they have."
<p>

Firmly, he said, "You have the belief in your just cause. You just

have to change your methods and learn from your experience and that of

others. Let me ask you, how did the USSR crumble? Before that, did

anyone expect the defeat of apartheid in South Africa? Did anyone

think that Vietnam could defeat a superpower like the US? What is the

difference between you and those that won? They changed their methods

and did not rely on the gun alone. They relied on their strong belief

and on alliances with the forces of peace. They achieved breakthroughs

with the world media when people we sympathetic with them. Did you

know that after the incident of Mohammad Al-Durra, the world became a

strange place for everyone? But you negated that with the lynching of

the Israelis, the burning of Joseph's tomb, a tomb for one of your

prophets, and when you started to shoot and kill like them."

<p>
Wondering, I asked him, "Did you want us to stand them with bare

chests without any resistance, and not to meet bullets with

bullets?"
<p>

He replied calmly, "No my friend. I want you to resist and to win with

your bare chests. Do you know how the world would react if you held a

peaceful rally without stones and bullets led by great people like

Carter, Mandella, Mary Robinson, and other advocates of justice, some

of whom are Jewish? How would the world react if Israeli soldiers

tried to stop this rally in front of TV cameras and tried to fire

teargas? Why don't you have a world peace movement under the title of

'justice now' in comparison to the 'peace now' camp in Israel? Why

don't you unite with them?"

<p>
I thought long on what the man said. He wasn't a magician; and his

ideas are not new. Maybe we are afraid to try something new. Maybe we

were born and raised believing that killing, bullets, and revenge are

the lone path.

<p>
Maybe we have to think of how to win and not just fight.
