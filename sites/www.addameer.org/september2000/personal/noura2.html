<H2>Personal Testimonies</H2>

<p><H3>From: Noura Erekat<br>
In the home of Mohammed al-Surkhy</H3>



<p>New posters had begun to go up in Abu-Dis. It was a picture of a young 
man 
with a strong jaw and a half smile, he is the newest shaheed: Mohammed 
al-Surkhy, 21 years old from neighboring Sawahre. 

<p>By the third day I had heard stories about his Mother, “She’s 
amazing…Allah has blessed her with patience…she was asking for a 
girl’s hand for Mohammed the night he was martyred….” And 
so I asked around and finally got a ride to see the Surkhy family. 
<p>From the outside the shaheed’s home was indistinguishable. No flags 
hung from their home, no huge pictures… in fact, other than the many 
posters of Mohammed that filled all of Sawahre’s streets nothing 
adorned the honored shaheed’s home. Once inside, the shaheed’s 
Mother was just as indistinguishable because everyone’s eyes brimmed 
with dried tears and a newly discovered loneliness. But Mohammed’s 
family noticed my confusion and pointed out ‘Alia, his Mother. A 
young-looking woman who clenched her “masbiha” (a beaded chain 
used for “thikr” or “to remember Allah”; some 
describe it as the Muslim rosary) and whose exhausted body was willing 
to sit 
with yet another visitor. At first we sat alone, but Mohammed’s loved 
ones filled the room by the second, his aunt on his Mom’s side, his 
sister, his other sister, his sister’s son, two of his brothers, his 
aunt on his father’s side, a neighbor, more visitors&#8
230;

<p>As the room filled with loved ones, ‘Alia questioned my 
credibility—who are you? Why are you here? You want to record 
Mohammed’s story? Where’s your press card? Not a journalist? You 
know there was a young woman here last week who said she was Lebanese 
but 
turned out to be Israeli…can’t trust everyone you know, 
especially at a time like this…after a good 30 minutes of grilling, 
Umm-Mohammed began to unfold Mohammed’s inevitable story of 
martyrdom…

<p>LIVING WITH A GHOST

<p>“I never felt his compassion—he had so much compassion it scared 
me but he never let me feel it.” 

<p>Unlike other Mothers of shuhada’ (plural of shaheed), Umm-Mohammed did 
not rave about her son’s loveable appeal or irresistible charm. 
Mohammed was cold, aloof, and even hostile. To talk to him was to annoy 
him. 
If his parents ever tried to induce him to speak he’d snap at them, 
“Be quiet—don’t ask—why do you keep 
asking—leave me alone!” 

<p>‘Alia laments that unlike other boys, he never sat down to breakfast, 
never wanted to be surrounded by his affectionate family. He’d pass 
through the house so quickly and so briefly that his Father, Fawzi, 
would 
often plead for Allah’s intervention: 
    
<p>“Oh Allah, all I crave is a simple gift, to sit with my son and hear 
him speak 
    to me for five minutes.”

<p>But Mohammed wouldn’t even give them that much, he would pass through 
the house like a shadow—coming home at 3 or 4 in the morning and 
leaving less than 5 hours later. ‘Alia’s description of her 
heart-wrenching quest to feel her son’s warmth elicited the images of a 
woman striving to hold a ghost whose physical presence is no more than 
that. 

<p>But Mohammed wasn’t always like that—he stopped talking at around 
12 or 13. That year marked violent and deadly clashes at al-Haram 
al-Sharif, 
(what we are currently witnessing is not a new phenomenon of Israeli 
military 
aggression). Then like now, the Israeli military prevented ambulances 
from 
entering al-Haram to carry out wounded Palestinians. Mohammed had just 
come 
out from school and was aware of the situation, so with his school bag 
still 
on his back he ran into al-Haram to carry the wounded to the waiting 
ambulances. As he ran with a wounded man in his arms, an Israeli 
officer shot 
the victim with a racing bullet to his head spilling his brain out onto 
Mohammed’s leg and then to the floor. Mohammed quickly picked up the 
brain in fear that someone would step on it, placed it in his pocket 
and kept 
trekking towards the ambulance. 

<p>Who was going to explain to a 13-year old boy,—BOY—who should 
have been studying or playing soccer or enjoying an after-school TV 
show, why 
the man he was trying to save was shot in the head? What did the man do 
to 
deserve his brain to be blown out of his head? How come the police and 
the 
military were shooting at them instead of protecting them like they 
were 
supposed to do? 

<p>HIDING HIS PASSPORT

<p>It was impossible to rationally explain to Mohammed what happened to 
him that 
day or what continued to happen around him in the land he always knew 
as 
“Falasteen.”  Is there a rational explanation for bulldozing a 
home while its inhabitants watch themselves become homeless? Is there a 
rational explanation why Palestinians have to sacrifice their land so 
that 
the Israeli regime can create bypass roads that they never get the 
privilege 
to use? Is there a rational explanation why the Palestinian Authority 
is 
pressured from the United States and Israel to incarcerate and torture 
its 
citizens in order to protect the largest nuclear power in the Middle 
East, 
the 17th richest country in the world? Neither Mohammed nor his family 
could 
answer these questions so instead of talking, Mohammed decided that the 
only 
answer was resistance. And he made the ultimate vow of resistance—he 
would die a shaheed—he would die standing—die fighting and 
standing in the face of oppression’s bulldoz
ers. 

<p>His Aunt says that that’s the reason for his coldness. He knew his 
destiny and did not want anyone to suffer when he was gone, 
    
<p>“He wouldn’t let anyone get attached to him because he knew what 
was in
    his self…we understood that he didn’t want to attach himself 
to anyone so 
    that no one would attach themselves to him…”

<p>But Mohammed’s plan backfired—instead of detaching themselves 
from him his family only loved him more; they always wanted more of him 
but 
never got enough. His Mother expresses her unfulfilled affection for 
Mohammed 
by describing him as a mystery, “I felt that he wasn’t from this 
planet—he wasn’t even from the same universe that we are 
from.” 

<p>And like the rest of the family, ‘Alia was well aware of her 
son’s passion for justice. He would declare his plans to go to Chechnya 
to fight with the Muslims under attack or to Afghanistan, or to India…. 
“I was so afraid that he’d really go that I would hide his 
passport.” ‘Alia described her daylong efforts to find the 
perfect hiding spot for his passport but all to no avail. Almost 
effortlessly, Mohammed would go through the room and uncover his 
passport’s hiding place, and without speaking he’d place it in 
his pocket and walk out the door. 

<p>“HIS SISTERS ARE LIKE HIS SOUL”

<p>Despite his aloof character, Mohammed could not deceive his family as 
he 
wished. Just because he stopped talking to them did not mean that he 
stopped 
caring for them. Mohammed is the eldest son of 9 children, only 23-year 
old 
Dalal is older than he is. As a result of the lack of Palestinian 
economic 
development (largely due to Israeli occupation), his Father could never 
make 
ends meet. ‘Alia imploringly asked us all, “What’s his 
Father going to be able to accomplish with 9 kids? Feeding, drinking, 
clothing, educating….?” Mohammed was painfully aware of this and 
only felt that he himself was a burden. So at 14 he dropped out of 
school and 
began working. 

<p>‘Alia comments that he never spent any money on himself in his effort 
to help his Father because he knew that there was “No one else to stand 
by his Father’s side.” The family lived with Fawzi’s 
parents for a long time and when he finally bought a piece of land to 
build a 
home on, Mohammed gave his Father 12,000 dinars—“Every month 
he’d give him all he could and hated asking for anything.”  

<p>Mohammed sacrificed his educational and professional future to help his 
family survive but never forgot the importance of an education. So he 
constantly encouraged his sisters to study hard and he promised that if 
they 
did well in school he would pay for their college education. In fact 
when 
Shema’, 20 years old, passed her matriculation exams with flying colors 
and her older sister Dalal failed one subject, Mohammed bought them 
both gold 
bracelets. His Mother asked him why he spent money on two bracelets 
when only 
one sister had passed and he responded that “I don’t want Dalal 
to believe that she is a failure.” (Today, Shema’ is enrolled in 
the Al-Quds University studying Law and Dalal is the proud Mother of 2 
taking 
vocational courses in Abu-Dis). ‘Alia describes his dedication 
perfectly when she says, “His sisters are like his soul.” 

<p>THE UNIRONED SHIRT  

<p>Despite her exhaustion, ‘Alia never gave up on Mohammed. She never 
stopped believing that somehow she could hold him in this world that he 
so 
rejected. She decided that if he were engaged to a “good girl,” 
he would become more grounded, stay around the house more often, share 
with 
them the feelings he never showed. Umm-Mohammed asked him what he 
thought 
about getting engaged and in his characteristic manner, he answered, “I 
guess so, whatever.” So ‘Alia searched for the bride herself and 
says she found the perfect woman for Mohammed. She described her to the 
non-interested groom-to-be who said he was willing to meet her. That 
was the 
most he ever said about his prospective marriage and for 20 days, ‘Alia 
would talk to the girl’s family about her son because he was never 
around to do it himself. 

<p>Finally she told Mohammed that he should visit the girl for himself and 
they 
arranged to do so the next day at 6 PM. Little did ‘Alia know that for 
the past 4 nights Mohammed had been busy carrying fallen and injured 
Palestinian youth to the hospital in his car and in his effort he had 
been 
shot 7 times with rubber bullets. She noticed his contorted walk but of 
course Mohammed only pushed her away when she asked, “What’s 
wrong? What’s going on?” 

<p>On the day of their plans Mohammed was no where to be seen. His friend 
kept 
answering his Mother’s frantic phone calls asking him to come home and 
get ready. But his friend only assured her that Mohammed had gone out 
on a 
trip and wasn’t going to be back for a while. So in the meantime she 
decided to iron his clothes for him and for some reason the iron would 
not 
press down on his shirt and in frustration she laid it on the bedroom 
floor 
and placed the table on top of it in hope that by the time her son came 
home 
to get dressed the shirt would be ready. 

<p>It was already 6 PM and Mohammed was not home yet, so ‘Alia and Fawzi 
decided to go to the bride’s home and hoped that Mohammed would be 
there soon But Umm-Mohammed describes the visit as excruciating, 

<p>“Something was juicing my insides and turning my heart 
over…I’m looking around at the bride, at the people, I could hear 
them speak but I had no idea what was going on…I kept dialing 
Mohammed’s phone but no one picked up so I put the phone down, looked 
up and told the family that I wanted to recite a poem: Do not depend on 
this 
world and what is in it, Because death will undoubtedly ruin it and 
ruin us, 
And how many brides did they decorate for their husbands, And her soul 
was 
stolen on her fateful night, Increase your fear of God because if you 
go to 
bed, You don’t know if you’ll live until dawn. A woman who has 
gone to the home of her son’s fiancé and she says something like 
that?”

<p>Mohammed had not shown up and at 9 PM, ‘Alia and Fawzi went home. At 
12:30 am, ‘Alia was woken up by the phone and it was Mohammed’s 
friend looking for her brother’s phone number. Like a drunken person 
she recited it and went back to sleep only to be woken up ten minutes 
later 
by another phone call. ‘Alia picked up the phone and before hearing the 
voice on the other line she asked, “Mohammed is dead isn’t 
he?” The crying voice on the receiver said that he had just been 
injured and that his Father should come to the hospital. But ‘Alia 
didn’t believe him, “I said ‘No, Mohammed is dead’ 
and hung up the phone, and my eye hit the iron, the turned over table, 
and 
the shirt—Allah didn’t permit the iron to work because he knew 
that the shirt’s owner would never be wearing it again.” 

<p>‘Alia and her husband rushed to the hospital but they stopped by at her 
brother’s home to bring him with them. She woke him at 1 am telling him 
that he should get dressed quick because they had to attend Mohammed’s 
wedding at the hospital, don’t waste time, “I swear tonight is 
his wedding.” Palestinians regard the martyrdom as a young man’s 
wedding to the land. At the hospital, no one wanted to let ‘Alia in in 
fear that she would not be able to handle the emotional shock of seeing 
her 
lifeless son. But despite their protests she pushed her way in and went 
straight to see Mohammed for the last time as he lay in his cold blood 
in a 
refrigerator drawer. ‘Alia asked to see him and after being assured 
that the Israeli bullet had not torn apart her son’s face she let out a 
“zaghrouta” (in Arab tradition, a celebratory cry created by 
rapidly moving one’s tongue from side to side; it is commonly made 
during weddings). ‘Alia was celeb
rating her son’s marriage to the land and his ascension into 
Allah’s embrace. And with her steady hands and head she went home to 
mourn her loss alone, away from the gaze of the comforting public. Her 
6-year 
old son, Taha sees her and urges her not to cry, “Mama, Mohammed is 
lucky to die a shaheed, I only hope to be so blessed.” 

<p>Yep, Barbara Boxer was right on. It’s those Palestinian mothers sending 
their kids out to die. It has nothing to do with the Israeli military 
teaching the Palestinian youth to hate them by sending their brothers 
home 
draped in cold blood.
