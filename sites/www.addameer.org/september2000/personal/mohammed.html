Subject: Constructive anger
</H3>

<p>My wife Khawla decided to go last Thursday to her parents home in
Issaweya in Jerusalem.  My father drove them, and I was looking for a
quiet weekend to catch up with my work and maybe sleep a bit, since my
son Fares and my daughter Malak always give us an early start every
morning.

<p>On Friday I started calling every two hours because I missed them
already, but in the afternoon, I couldn't get of the hook because
Khawla's brother Khaled was injured in the Al-Haram Al-Sharif events.
Issaweya was closed by Israeli police forces and I couldn't go to bring
them back.  Things went tense by the moment as I heard Fares's
descriptions of what went on.  He wanted me to buy him a gun (remember,
he is only five years old) to go and defend Al-Aqsa, and to prevent any
harm to his grandmother.  He went on and on describing his uncle's
bloody clothes, and how Khaled was shot while carrying one of the
Palestinian Martyrs.  Malak who is only 4, described how she joined in
collecting stones in plastic bags and gave them to the <I>Shabab</I> who defied
the well-armed soldiers.  The interesting thing is that they were not
afraid.

<p>My parents and friends in the Nazareth area were we live, demanded that
I change the plan and rush to bring them back from the war zone.
Together with my wife we decided to let them experience the reality of
their family in Jerusalem, as harsh as it could be.  After all we are
part of the same Palestinian nation, and they should learn the full
meaning of it.

<p>Today I went to Jerusalem to bring them back, but before doing so, I
took Fares with me to Al-Maqased hospital to donate blood, and met with
Dr. Khaled Qrei, the Director of the hospital who told me how happy he
was when more than 2000 Palestinians from all over Palestine donated
blood following the first call from the hospital.  He complained, though,
of the lack of space and equipment and stressed the need to raise funds
to be able to answer the needs of the local Palestinian community.

<p>After consulting with some friends we decided to initiate a Friends of
Al-Maqased Hospital in the Galilee, to raise funds and equipment to
help this establishment which has treated, over the last 3 days, more than 500
Palestinians wounded in the clashes with the Israeli forces.

<p>I call on every friend who gets this message to take a part in this
effort.  Let us turn our anger into constructive action.  Anyone
interested in joining me in this effort please contact me.

<p>Now we are back in our home in Iksal, Nazareth, waiting for what
tomorrow is carrying for us.  It looks as if, after having martyrs from
Umm El Fahem and many injured youths from many of the Palestinian
villages inside Israel, that the Palestinian cause is once again uniting with
the mixing of Palestinian blood.

<p>Israeli brutality against our people must end.
