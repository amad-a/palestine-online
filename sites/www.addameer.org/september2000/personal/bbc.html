<p><H3>Letter from Bethlehem</H3>

<br>by Alex and Brenda, Bethlehem Bible College



<p>Dear Friends,

<p>Thank you for continuing to write us and encourage us through your
support and prayers! As you know, we have been undergoing trying
times
during the last three and one half weeks.  The College has been
closed
a large part of this time due to strikes, demonstrations, and
closures.  We were hopeful that the cease-fire negotiated at Sharm
el-Sheik would be able to turn the tide in the cycle of violence that
has permeated this land. Unfortunately, it appears that neither side
was willing to implement fully the understanding that was reached
at
Sharm el-Sheik, each waiting on the other to move first.    The
Palestinian communities are in shock and grief  over the drastic and
disproportionate use of force against them, a force which has killed
over 150 civilians and injured over 7000.  All the Palestinians are
seeking is independence and self-determination in areas over which
Israel was never granted sovreignty.

<p>Since the  summit, there has been a determination on the part of
many
Palestinians to continue their resistance of the occupation by
voicing
their dissent in a variety of ways. These include:  informing the
outside world through information technologies, marches, stone
throwing or light gun fire.

<p>Living among Palestinians makes us all too aware of the siege
under
which Palestinians live.  At this time, due to the shelling of
outlying areas in Beit Sahour by the Israeli military, we were asked
by GBGM to move to Jerusalem.  We feel a sense of guilt at being
thus
"over privileged", knowing that we can leave the conflict and our
Palestinian neighbors cannot. Right now we are staying at Tantur
(ecumenical theological center) just outside of Bethlehem.  The
phone
number is 972-2-676-0911. We are also carrying our cellular phone
with
us (972-2-52-723-545).

<p>Several homes in Beit Sahour, the village where we live, have been
hit. These homes are near the edge of Beit Sahour.  It seems the
Israeli military are determined to crush the Palestinian uprising,
even if it includes attacks on civilians. Yesterday around 5:30 PM
Beit Sahour was shelled again, and we heard this morning that it
was
one of the worst nights thus far.  We can never tell when or how
often
the Israelis plan to do this, as they have been carrying out military
actions off and on for the last 3 and one half weeks, especially after
dark.  Three nights ago, the helicopters were directly over our
house,
we assume en route to their target.  The Israeli military have been
calling on Beit Jala residents in outlying areas to evacuate their
homes so they can shell them indiscriminately.  Where are these
people
supposed to go? Last night, a lot of damage was inflicted in the Beit
Jala area.

<p>Ideally, and as Christians, we know that violence is not the answer
to
resolving conflicts, but it is hard to tell this to a refugee from a
camp who has never been free to determine his or her own destiny
due
to a brutal and repressive occupation.  Peace talks have not
achieved
for the Palestinians the hope of a better future.  The Oslo Peace
Accords have led from one false hope to another false hope.
Palestinians have been treated like children who have been given
pacifiers, while the Israelis and other powers dictate their future.
They woke up to realize that what they aspired to was simply a
mirage,
and they have run out of hope that agreements will lead to anything
other than a continuation of Israeli aggression against them.  As we
watch Palestinian mourners bear their dead on open coffins through
their towns and villages, we realize just how deep is their anguish,
anguish at losing a loved one and anguish at being victimized and
delegitimized as a people.

<p>We urge you to do whatever you can to stop this aggression. Israel
must not be above international laws.  US unconditional support of
the
State of Israel makes the US an accomplice in Israel's crimes
against
humanity. We call on all of our friends in the US to voice their
rejection of a US policy that encourages aggression by not
standing up
against it.

<p>Isaiah 59:14:  So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands
at
a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets; honesty cannot enter.
Isaiah 59: 15 (b). The Lord looked and was displeased that there
was
no justice.

<p>Please continue to pray for good to triumph over evil!

<p>In Christ's love & service,

<p>Alex & Brenda
