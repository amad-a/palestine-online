<p><B>Planting Geraniums ... just in case! - my notes </B>

<p>Dear Colleagues,

<p>Last Friday (17th November), around lunchtime, I took my son to
the
barber's across the street from Al Bardauni Restaurant in Ramallah.
Most of the international visitors to the Ministry of Education, and
to Palestine in general, have been to Al Bardauni. It is the
restaurant on the main street leading downhill to the west (towards
Tel Aviv) out of Ramallah town center. It is the one with the
magnificent garden, full of multi-colored seasonal blooms most of
the
year round. It is, also, the one with the fireplace in winter, with
the small fish tank on top, in the indoors dining hall with the
unplastered old stone walls coated with transparent silicon to make
them damp-proof.

<p>Two of Al Bardauni's waiters were planting Geraniums in the isle in
the middle of the street. As soon as I stopped the car, they looked at
me and greeted me with a wave of the hand and broad smiles. They
immediately reminded me of the first intifada of 1987.

<p>For more than four years during the first intifada, Al Bardauni was
closed down. The waiters and cooks lost their jobs. The owner, Adel,
survived by shifting to a number of alternative odd jobs. He moved the
tables and chairs out of the beautiful garden and turned the space
into a small farm to breed and sell German Shepard dogs and into a
plant nursery and green house. He fermented and sold natural plant
fertilizer. He landscaped and maintained gardens around Ramallah. He,
also, fixed leaking roofs of houses. He taught gardening on a
part-time basis at the Ramallah Friends School and gave seedlings for
the School's garden in return for the tuition fees of his son. This
was not the first time Al Bardauni was closed down. It happened once
before, in June 1967, when the war broke out and Israel occupied the
West Bank and Gaza. At that time Adel was only six years old.

<p>Adel's father started the Restaurant in 1963, from his savings as a
contractor in Kuwait. Previously, in 1961, he started another
restaurant in Jericho. He named both after Al Bardauni River in
Zahleh, Lebanon, where he and his wife spent their honeymoon. The
Jericho Al Bardauni had children’s outdoor games and a small zoo!  It
was a success story. Adel's mother liked the animals and took care of
them. She especially liked a female one-eyed ape. The ape was very
friendly and moved freely outside her cage among the customers of the
restaurant. One day, she snatched four-month-old Adel from the arms of
his mother, hugged him and ran up a tree. She was lured back, with
Adel, to the ground with food offered by Adel's frightened mother. In
June 1967, the Jericho Al Bardauni was looted. The animals
disappeared. More than a year later, Adel's family were visiting the
famous Tel Aviv zoo. In a cage, a one-eyed ape recognized Adel's
mother and started jumping frantically around and uttered deafening
shrieks. Adel's mother cried. She could do nothing more than go back
home to Ramallah, very sad. After 1967, the Ramallah Al Bardauni
reopened. But it was not until 1983 that it really picked up again,
this time under Adel's modern-style management, until the first
intifada started in 1987.

<p>In 1992, Al Bardauni started operating again, with one cook and one
waiter, with Adel. Slowly, it picked up and the old staff started
returning to the Restaurant, one by one. The boom happened after the
setting up of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994. Just before
Al Aqsa Intifada started on September 28th, Al Bardauni had 42
employees altogether, during both summer and winter. They had the
capacity to serve 370 people all at once. On average, the Restaurant
had 150 customers per day. It generated a daily income of US$ 2,000.
Adel believes that the biggest asset in Al Bardauni was his employees.
They had a strong sense of belonging to the place. This is why most of
the old employees came back after the first intifada. The secret in
this is that Adel uses a collaborative and participatory approach in
management (to use some of our jargon at the Ministry of Education).
They hold weekly meetings to discuss issues freely and openly. He also
treats them like friends and takes good care of them. He provides them
with training, locally and internationally. Many of them had, at least
one, crash course in psychology.

<p>Now, Al Bardauni is empty and quiet. No commotion and excitement like
when Robert di Nero  or  Dennis Ross dined here. No more music, no
more colored lights till dawn every day. No smell of barbecued
well-marinated lamb and kebab and narghiles with good tobacco. No more
smoke gushing out of the kitchen’s chimney. All through last month,
October, its total income was less than US$2,000, i.e. one day's
income before the present intifada started. Thirty of the employees
could not come to work from their villages and towns in the West Bank
because of the Israeli-imposed closure and siege on Ramallah. They,
however, received half of their October salaries from Al Bardauni. The
remaining twelve live in Ramallah. They work in two shifts per day,
half the normal working hours only. They receive two thirds of their
salaries. At any time, there are more waiters in the Restaurant than
customers, Adel says. He has already turned half of the garden space
into a green house. No German Shepard dogs, as yet. He has the
financial ability to go on like this for three more months. Meanwhile,
he and his employees are planting the seasonal plants in preparation
for spring.They do this dressed up in their usual clean black trousers
and bright white jackets, with the name tags on their chests. "We have
to keep the hope and we have to be prepared for the return of normal
life and for spring, and for customers ... just in case".
