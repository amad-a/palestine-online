<p>A strict Israeli imposed internal closure remains in place throughout the West 
  Bank and Gaza Strip. 4 Palestinians were killed today and 110 injured as a result 
  of injuries sustained in clashes and attacks with tanks and heavy machine gun 
  fire by the Israeli military within the occupied Palestinian territories of 
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian residents 
  either travelling on major roads, attempting to harvest olive orchards, or in 
  residential areas continue, in addition to the destruction of Palestinian agricultural 
  lands.

  by live ammunition to his back.

  killed today by injuries sustained from tank shell directly hitting him while 
  working 250 meters from Tufah Junction in Gaza.
<p>Amjad 'Azmi Mohammad 'Abadi, 21 years old from Jenin, was shot and killed today 
  by live ammunition to his abdomen during clashes on the Nazareth-Jenin road.
<p>Abdel Men'em Mohammad 'Izzedin, 18 years old from 'Arrabi, Jenin, was shot

  At least 30 Palestinians were injured as a result of attacks by the Israeli 
  military with tanks and heavy machine gun fire on the western area of Khan Younis 
  Refugee Camp. At least 2 Palestinians were reported in critical condition as 
  a result of the attacks. Severe damage was sustained by houses in the camp as 
  a result of the attack, including a nearby office of the Palestinian National 
  Security Forces. The Israeli military also attacked with heavy machine gun fire 
  and tanks residential areas of the Beit Hanoun region, causing damage to a number 
  of homes in Sudania and Beit Lahiya, in addition to an office of the Palestinian 
  National Security Forces.
<p>This morning, at least 6 Palestinians were injured by live ammunition during 
  clashes at Tufah Junction in Khan Younis. At approximately 4pm in the afternoon, 
  the Israeli military fired tank shells from a nearby military post at Tufah 
  Junction. One shell hit 18 year old Tayseer Adnan Hammad Abu Al 'Arraj, causing 
  injuries to his chest and killing him immediately. He was unloading sacks of 
  flour from a truck 250 meters away far from from the Israeli military post and 
  the site of clashes in the morning. Two of his fellow workers, 18 year old Raed 
  Fayez Abu Aker 18 year old Hammad Fayez Abu Al 'Arraj, were also injured by 
  shrapnel from the same shell. Another shell directly hit the truck they were 
  unloading, resulting in a hole 18cm in diameter hole to the truck. Two ambulances 
  were also hit by shells at a distance of 150 meters from the post, injuring 
  first aid medic Sami Ibrahim Abu Namous, 30 years old, and ambulance driver 
  'Awni Hamdan Al Agha, 47 years old. Another 30 Palestinians, many of which are 
  children, were also injured by shrapnel to different parts of their bodies as

  areas. 24 houses were either destroyed, partially damaged or caught on fire 
  during the past two days of attacks with tanks and heavy machine gun fire.

  another, preventing the majority of workers reaching their places of work, students 
  from reaching schools and universities primarily located in the central northern 
  areas of Gaza, in addition to the movement of goods. In addition, Amnesty International
