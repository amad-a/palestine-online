<H2>Latest Developments No. 7 - Tuesday 3 October 2000,

Web posted 6:45 PM (GMT+2), Ramallah, West Bank</H2>

<p>In Gaza, tanks and helicopters are shooting into crowds of civilians at Netzarim Junction and the surrounding

  neighborhoods on the border of Gaza.  Reports coming in state that Israeli helicopters are shooting down

  exploding fragment bombs, which have caused 21 serious injuries thus far.  The total injuries reported so far in

  Gaza today are 85 due to live ammunition.



  <p>Three Palestinians are confirmed to be dead as a result of clashes at Netzarim:

<ul><li> Fahmi Abu Amouni, 30 years old, Nusseyrat Refugee Camp

<li>Mahmoud Abu Obeid, 18 yeas old, Gaza City (his head was blown in half by ammunition fired by Israeli

  helicopters).

  <li>Omar Mahmoud Abdel Rahman Suleiman, 20 years old, Jabalya Refugee Camp (died after a rocket fired from

  Israeli helicopters hit him in the head) </ul>



  <p>Tanks and helicopters are shooting into Palestinian neighborhoods in Rafah, including areas under Palestinian

  Autonomy (Area A).  Details are not available at this point.



  <p>Clashes continue to take place at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, in which Israeli troops have been using helicopters

  and snipers from nearby mountains.  So far, there are 25 injuries from live ammunition, 3 of which are critical.

  Helicopters have also been shooting down into Palestinian neighborhoods in the area.



  <p>In Beit Sahour, intermittent exchange of fire has been taking place all day.  Within the past half-hour, Israeli

  troops have brought in helicopters that are shooting into Palestinian neighborhoods in the area.  No further

  details are available at this date.  However, in the Bethlehem area (Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Aida Refugee Camp,

  Hussan, Tqu'), the total number of injuries is reported to be 50.



  <p>Radio reports confirmed that Khadra Ahmad Hussein Salameh, 56 years old, from Faqu'a in the Jenin area, died

  today from injuries sustained on Friday.  She was buried today, after which clashes resumed in the Jenin area,

  where 55 injuries have been reported to date.  (Please note that in previous updates she was listed as being

  from Bethlehem).



  <p>Muhammad Younis Ayash Az Zama'ari, 17 years old from Halhoul, died today of injuries sustained from

  Saturday.  The Israeli Authorities have yet to hand over Muhammad's corpse to his family as he died in

  Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem.



 <p> In Rammalah, clashes took place near the Beit El settlement after the funeral of Muhammad Nabil Da'oud, who

  died on Sunday.  45 injuries were reported, 4 of which are critical.



 <p> The heaviest clashes today occurred in Hebron, where 3000 Palestinians participated in protests. Undercover

  Israeli units entered Palestinian controlled areas trying to arrest and shoot at civilians.   In the Palestinian

  controlled part of Hebron, Israeli troops invaded the home of a Palestinian family, who were evacuated and the

  home turned into an Israeli military outpost.  The total number of injuries from the Hebron area (Hebron, Samu',

  Yatta, Beit Uma, Ithna) are 60, 37 of which were sustained from live ammunition.  Helicopters are presently

  circling over the area as clashes continue through the evening.



 <p> In Tulkarem, 16 injuries have been reported thus far, with reports of undercover Israeli units using weapons

  with silencers to shoot at protesters.  This is particularly dangerous, as it is now dark and difficult to identify

  individuals within crowds, allowing Israeli snipers to shoot at protestors.



  <p>Updated list of Palestinian deaths from today:

<ul>

  <li> Fahmi Abu Amouni, 30 years old, Nusseyrat Refugee Camp

  <li>  Mahmoud Abu Obeid, 18 yeas old, Gaza City (his head was blown in two by ammunition fired by Israeli

  helicopters).

  <li>   Omar Mahmoud Abdel Rahman Suleiman, 20 years old, Gaza City

  <li>  Muhammad Younis Ayash Az Zama'ari, 17 years old, Halhoul

  <li> Khadra Ahmad Hussein Salameh, 56 years old, Faqu'a</ul>



<p>  According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the total number of injuries reported from today's clashes

  throughout the West Bank and Gaza is 285.
