<H3>CASUALTIES FROM TODAY'S ROCKET ATTACKS ON PALESTINIAN AREAS</H3>

rocket attacks on Gaza. In addition, 30 Palestinians were reported injured
in Gaza, and 17 in Ramallah.</P>


<P>
In Nablus, a building of the Palestinian Authority National Security Force

a police station near Joseph's Tomb.</P>

<BR>
<BR>


<H3>CONTINUING ATTACKS</H3>


<P>
Despite Israeli PM Barak's announcement at a press conference earlier this
evening that attacks have ceased, attacks in fact continued this evening in
Nablus, Salfit, Hebron and Jericho. In Jericho, Israeli Cobra helicopters
attacked a police training centre with missiles.</P>


<P>
Both Israeli Cobra helicopters and Jewish settlers are reportedly attacking
Palestinian neghbourhoods in Hebron, with 3 Palestinians reported injured.
By midnight, Palestinian Time (GMT+2), clashes were continuing.</P>

<H3>MORE INFORMATION ON THE KILLING OF ISRAELI SOLDIERS
</H3>

<P>
Media reports widely quoted Israeli government spokesmen claiming that the
Israeli soldiers killed this morning in Ramallah Police Station were
reservists who had accidently driven into Ramallah:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The latest incident began when the reserve soldiers made a wrong turn as
they were driving to a military base and ended up in the
Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem."
<BR>
<BR>

-- from "Palestinian mob kills Israelis, drags bodies through the street"<BR>
    <A HREF="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20001012_1369.html" TARGET="_blank">http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20001012_1369.html</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>
Palestinian sources report that the soldiers were members of one of the many
Israeli undercover units that reported to be active around Palestinian areas
and have been responsible for many of the killings since clashes begun on 29
September. 
</P>

<P>
An Associated Press image of one of the captured soldiers appears to back
this claim up, showing him wearing a Palestinian scarf and plain, not
military clothes:<BR>

<P>
Ramallah has had Israeli checkpoints set up around the entrances to the city
for one week now, and the town is clearly marked with large red street signs
written in Hebrew that warn drivers they are about to enter Ramallah. These
factors would seem to make an accidental entry unlikely.</P>

<H3>ADDAMEER WEB SERVER DOWN</H3>


<P>
Addameer's Web server connected via the Israeli Internet is still down as of
this morning. It is not clear whether this is the result of Israeli
government interference, hacker attack, or problems with the Palestinian
ISP. For those interested, you can observe the traceroute path to this
server at <A HREF="http://www.above.net/cgi-bin/trace?www.addameer.org" TARGET="_blank">http://www.above.net/cgi-bin/trace?www.addameer.org</A></P>
