<p><a name="2"></a><b>2. The effects of closure on Kherebtha Bani Hareth (a village west of Ramallah) 
  </b> 
<p>Since the start of the clashes that began at the end of September, Israeli occupation forces have implemented a policy of collective punishment against the Palestinian population. Imposing tight closure on Palestinian villages and towns was one of these policies. These measures have had disastrous effects on the lives of Palestinians, particularly those living in villages that are heavily dependent on their connection to towns.  



<p>Kherebtha Bani Hareth to the west of Ramallah has been suffering under closure for more than four months. Since the beginning of the clashes, Israeli military forces blocked all the entrances to the village including both paved and unpaved roads. This has isolated the village not only from the town of Ramallah but also from surrounding villages. The village is located on the edge of the 1948 areas and more than half of its residents previously worked in the area. Thirty-five stores in the village were forced to close as they depend on trade from the 1948 areas. 



<p>The long period of closure has forced the villagers to attempt to open alternative roads but the hilly nature of the area made it impossible to do so. The villagers are now required to use a 4-km long road, passing through hills and a deep valley, in order to reach the closest village of Ni'lin. This road can be used only on foot or on the back of animals, mainly donkeys. As not everyone owns a donkey, villagers are often forced to bring supplies from the village of Ni'lin on their backs. It is almost impossible to take someone out for medical care or treatment. 



<p>Villagers state that it is especially difficult to carry pregnant women on their shoulders through the valley in order to take them to Ni'lin and then to Ramallah. Many women have given birth in the valley itself while attempting to reach Ni'lin. 



<p>Dr. Mahmoud Daraghmeh from Ni'lin village, who has a long experience with the medical and health situation in Kherebtha and the other surrounding villages, underlined that the most difficult problem is to get patients outside the village of Kherebtha since the Israeli military forces are banning ambulances from reaching the village. Dr. Mahmoud said that isolated villages to the west of Ramallah are facing an extremely difficult situation as a result of the lack of medical equipment and staff. 



<p>The closure on this village has disrupted the education process since teachers cannot reach the village and its two schools. It is estimated that the schools are at least two months behind the emergency schedule of the educational year. 



<p>The extremely difficult situation in this village is not an isolated example and many other Palestinian villages like Ras Karkar, Deir Nitham, Deir Ibzi, Silwad and Rantis in Ramallah area are facing similar conditions due to the Israeli-imposed closure and policy of collective punishment.
