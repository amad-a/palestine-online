<H2>Latest Developments No. 41 - 24 October 2000 Web Posted 11:30 PM  (GMT+2), 

  Ramallah, West Bank </H2>






<br><br>A strict internal closure re-imposed by the
Israeli Authorities yesterday on the West Bank
and Gaza continues, with the majority of villages
and cities isolated from one another.  Clashes
erupted this afternoon in areas in the West Bank
and Gaza, as mass protest rallies marched towards
checkpoints separating the West Bank and
Jerusalem.  The Israeli military used tank
missiles to attack residential areas in Ramallah,
Tulkarem and Hebron and Jericho.

<br><br>Nidal Mohammad Zuhdi Al Dbeiki, 16 years old,
from Gaza City, was shot and killed today by live
ammunition to his chest.  

<br><br>Nimr Youssef Nimr Mari', 22 years old, from Kufur
Dan, Jenin, was shot and killed today from high
velocity live ammunition to his heart.  

<br><br>Iyad Osama Sha'ath, 13 years old from Khan
Younis, Gaza died today from injuries sustained
four days ago from rubber coated steel bullets to
his head.  He was previously announced clinically
dead.    

<br><br>Ramallah<br>
Clashes erupted this afternoon on the borders of
Palestinian Authority controlled Area A
('Ma'loufiyeh', where the majority of clashes
took place in Ramallah in 1996 after the opening
of a tunnel by the Israeli Authorities under the
Al Aqsa Mosque Compound) after mass protest
rallies attempted to march towards Jerusalem. 
Israeli tanks fired 3 missiles at a residential
area on the eastern border of Al Bireh late this
evening.  No injuries were reported.  

<br><br>Hebron<br>
Clashes erupted this afternoon after the funeral
of 55 year old Abdul Aziz Mahmoud Taha Abu
Sneineh, who was killed yesterday in his home by
a direct hit from tank missiles launched at his
home last night.  Exchange of fire was reported
late this evening in the village of Sa'ir.  The
Israeli controlled areas of Hebron remain under
curfew for the 25th consecutive day.  

<p>Jericho<br>
Aqbet Jaber Refugee Camp was attacked this
evening by heavy machine gun fire from the nearby
Israeli settlement of Vered Yeriho.  Heavy
machine gun fire at the Palestinian waiting area
('Istirahah') on the border crossing to Jordan
was also reported.  

<p>Bethlehem<br>
Israeli tanks fired missiles this evening on
residential areas in Beit Sahour, damaging at
least 3 homes.  A number of light injuries were
reported. 

<p>Nablus<br>
In the village of Huwarra, an Israeli imposed
curfew was lifted briefly after 17 consecutive
days.  Residents attempted to reach their olive
orchards to harvest olive crops, at which point
Israeli settlers attacked the farmers. 
Palestinian residents were forced back to their
homes and the curfew was re-imposed.  

<p>Jenin<br>
Clashes erupted this afternoon in Jenin, with a
number of Palestinians reported injured. 
Eyewitnesses state that the Israeli authorities
did not use tear gas or rubber coated steel
bullets to fire on protesters.  Only live
ammunition was used.  A state of emergency was
announced in all hospitals in Jenin this
afternoon.  

<p>Gaza<br>
Clashes erupted this afternoon in Beit Hanoun,
Khan Younis, Deir Al Balah and Rafah, with at
least 53 Palestinians reported injured, 6 in
critical condition.  Mohammad Abu Taha, 13 years
old from Khan Younis, is reported to be in
extremely critial condition.  

<p>Tulkarem <br>
The Israeli military launched 4 tank missiles at
residential areas in Tulkarem late this evening,
injuring at least 1 Palestinian.  


<p>Restriction of movement of medical vehicles
Ambulances continued to be denied freedom of
movement throughout the West Bank and Gaza this
afternoon.  In areas in the north, ambulances
were prevented from transporting injured
Palestinians to hospitals.  As a result of the
strict Israeli imposed internal closure,
ambulances were prevented from tranferring needed
medical equipment and medicines from hospitals
throughout the West Bank and Gaza.  Palestinian
residents in villages are denied access to
hospitals within main cities for regular medical
treatment.  In addition to restrictions on
movement within Palestinian areas, ambulances
have also been restricted from transferring
critical injuries for immediate medical treatment
outside of the country.  

<p>Destruction of agricultural lands<br>
The Israeli Authorities today continued to
destroy Palestinian agricultural lands throughout
the West Bank and Gaza.  At least 4 dunums of
olive orchards were bulldozed this afternoon near
Netzarim Junction in Gaza, uprooting hundreds of
olive trees. Olive orchards were bulldozed in the
village of Hossan, Bethlehem, Salfit, Nablus, in
addition to a banana plantation in Jericho.  The
destruction of olive orchards and agricultural
lands comes at a time when Palestinian farmers
harvest crops tended to over the year, a form of
income sustaining a great majority of the
Palestinian population.  The destruction of olive
crops holds serious economic ramifications for
the majority of Palestinian villages whose main
economic production is dependent on olives and
olive by products.
