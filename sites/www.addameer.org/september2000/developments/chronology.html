Interpreted as an apparent show of force to undermine Netanyahu’s influence, more than 1,000 Israeli police were reported to have surrounded the Haram and to have opened fine  on the worshippers who tried to stop them. At least 7 Palestinians were killed and 255 injured (LAW).

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Violent demonstrations erupted in most of the major districts and towns of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, particularly in the towns of Hebron, Ramallah and Gaza. Reported Israeli use of live ammunition, dum-dum bullets, rubber coated steel bullets was considered evidence of Israeli excessive and unnecessary use of force against demonstrators. According to various Palestinian medical sources and field researchers of local human rights groups, the majority of the injuries sustained were to the upper parts of the body, including chest, neck, head or eyes. Moreover, in a press release, Defense Children International/Palestine section confirmed that out of the 550 injuries, 175 cases were children aged 9-18 years. The release also mentioned that the day’s clashes resulted in 6 more Palestinian deaths, 4 of which were minors. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>The final moments of the assassination of 12 year old Mohamed El Durra as he attempted to hide with his father behind a concrete block in GAza, (caught on film by a French camera crew), brought about an International wave of condemnation of Israel’s disproportionate use of force and shoot to kill” policy. The Israeli army released a statement that it would look into the incident, but also accused Palestinians of “making cynical use of children and women by bringing them to flashpoints” !? (Dallas Morning News).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Meanwhile, Barak had an emergency meeting with senior defense officials and ministers Shlomo Ben Ami and Amon Lipkin-Shahak to discuss the recent developments.  According to Ha’aretz, Barak stated that “our restraint is the best proof that we do not wish further confrontation”. He was also quoted to have assured that “no one doubts who is stronger or more capable of sustaining s fight”. Israel also accused the leaders of the Palestinian youth paramilitary group Fatah and leading members of the Palestinian security apparatus to be directly responsible for staging the disturbances in the West Bank. </LI></P></UL>

Moreover, a fierce gun battle broke our when Palestinian police was said to have returned fire at Israeli soldiers. Two soldiers died as a result in separate incidents.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>According to the Jerusalem Post, the funeral of the eldest son of the Palestinian Authority governor of Nablus attracted thousands of demonstrators and resulted in more clashes with Israeli soldiers at Joseph’s Tomb, killing 2 Israeli soldiers, a member of the Palestinian National Security Forces and injuring 65 other Palestinians. Eyewitnesses account that Israeli helicopters were also seen firing on demonstrators in the area and firing flares. Israeli forces were sharply criticized by several human rights groups for deliberately targeting those not directly involved in the clashes, such as medical personnel and journalists. According to Al Haq, ambulances were constantly denied, roads to hospitals obstructed (press release 56/2000). </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Major roads throughout the West Bank and Gaza were sealed off to civilian traffic. Arafat demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from the entrances of Palestinian towns and called upon the UN to form an international committee that would investigate the events of the past few days. </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>According to a statement by the International Press Institute, Israeli helicopters were reported to have fired missiles on the Voice of Palestine station, forcing it off air. The attacks also targeted Palestinian Authority headquarters, in what was interpreted as an act of retaliation for the killing of two Israeli soldiers during separate clashes in Ramallah. A number of news reports stated that the soldiers who were in custody of Palestinian police force at the Ramallah/Al-Bireh police headquarters, were attacked by a large number of civilians who entered the station and had them killed. Holding the Palestinian Authority responsible, a statement by the Israeli Defense Force asserted that “this operation was a symbolic warning to the Palestinian leadership to let it know we will nor stand idly”, and threatened to further bomb Palestinian military posts. Meanwhile, Arafat is said to have ordered an investigation into the killing of the two captive soldiers (Reuters report).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI> Following the Israeli retaliation, which resulted in the complete destruction of the central police station and the injury of 16 people, Amnesty International expressed grave concern for the safety of Palestinian civilians.

According to the same official “in addition to the written declaration read by President Clinton, the two sides reached a mutual understanding on security issues that will be kept secret”.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Several incidents of settler attacks against farmers were reported in various locations throughout the West Bank, such as the town of Qalqilya, and the villages of Beit Fouriq and Salim, where farmers were prevented from picking their olives (a vital part of the local economy). So far 3 others had died as a result of settler attacks. With this incident, the death toll rose to 95, and more than 4,000 injured (Palestine Center for Human Rights, press release). </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Eyewitnesses report the use of specialized rifles fitted with silencers by Israeli snipers to “take out” ringleaders of demonstrations and riots. According to an article in the Times (London), “victims just flopped down and bled, sometimes unnoticed”. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Israeli forces were also reported to have used live ammunition against Palestinian laborers in Erez Industrial Zone, wounding several. Denying access to its 3,000 workers, the move triggered protests by the laborers, to which Israeli forces hence responded with tear gas and live ammunition. 13 were wounded by rubber bullets. </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Meanwhile, Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza remains in full force, preventing the transfer of goods, medical supplies and people in and out of the Occupied territories, thus “effectively imprisoning residents” (Defense Children International, Release). </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Human Rights Watch released results of the investigation that it conducted in the Palestinian territories (4-11 October 2000). The report condemned Israeli police and security for a pattern of using excessive, lethal force with demonstrators. It also strongly denounced incidents where Palestinian police were reported to have shot at Israeli from positions where civilians were present. However, it also noted that in cases when Palestinian security forces fired on Israeli soldiers, Israeli forces had failed to abide by international standards requiring them to direct lethal force at the source of the threat. Finally, it called on the special session of the UN Commission on Human Rights meeting this week in Geneva, to authorize the High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson to conduct an impartial investigation into human rights violations in the territories. Senior Israeli army officials had turned down repeated requests for a meeting to discuss the organization’s findings.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>Similarly, UN investigator to the Palestinian territories Giorgio Giacomelli was quoted by Reuters to have stated that the scale of Palestinian deaths at the hands of Israeli forces during the recent wave of disturbances was “unprecedented”. In the report on his mission (11-15<SUP>th</SUP> October 2000), he asserts that Israeli killings of Palestinians exceeded the first four months of the 1987 Intifada that had gripped the Palestinian territories. Furthermore, the report, which was issued to the human rights commission at a two day special session in Geneva, also said  that at least “40% of an estimated 2,000-3,700 Palestinians wounded by Israeli occupation forces  were under the age of 18 and that at least half of the injuries resulted from the use of live ammunition”.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>In its statement in front of t he Commission, the World Organization for Torture stressed that “Israel’s choice of weaponry was the type usually reserved for battlefield military engagement and not for civilian demonstrations”. Moreover, “Israel has made no single investigation into the use of force against Palestinians or the death of Palestinians occasioned by such force. No forensic evidence has been collected and no inquiry has been made”. </LI></P></UL>

Clashes also continued around most of the major cities of Jenin, Ramallah, Tulkarem, Al-Bireh and Hebron, in addition to several villages. One Palestinian was killed. (Al Haq, Release). According to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, clashes between demonstrators and Israeli soldiers in several areas of the Gaza Strip, particularly in the vicinity of the settlement of Kfar Darom, which  resulted in the injury of more than 50 Palestinians by live ammunition. Villagers from Khirbet Qalqis also reported the expansion of a nearby settlement by clearing their land nearby for expansion. Rockets were allegedly also fired. In Jerusalem on the other hand, a peaceful rally was dispersed with tear gas by Israeli police, which also resulted in clashes, and a mass arrest campaign (Addameer, Update)</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI> The International Federation of Human Rights releases the findings of its mission to the Occupied Territories. It established excessive and indiscriminate use of force. It also stressed that the impunity of Israeli forces is “in sharp contrast tot he judicial and administrative actions taken against Palestinians held in Israeli custody”, and demanded the establishment of an international independent commission of enquiry.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>In a statement by Habitat International Coalition to the Special Commission on Human Rights on the situation in the Palestinian Territories convening in Geneva, the organization’s representative called the commission’s attention to the violation of the right of “adequate housing”. Israeli soldiers have reportedly occupied the homes of Palestinian civilians  and “converted them into military positions, resulting in their destruction and/or eviction of the resident families”.  Moreover, the statement welcomed the Sharm El Sheik agreement’s intention to establish a fact finding mission to investigate the sources of the crisis, however, it stressed that “like Security Resolution 1322, it offers no assurance that the human rights norms, or the requisite degree of objectivity would be applied”. Moreover, it charged that “the indispensable human rights ingredients are so far lacking in the much hailed peace process led by the United States and even…the Sharm Al Sheikh meeting apparently still has missed the point”.  </LI></P></UL>

(On September 25<SUP>th</SUP>, the Defense Department announced the possible sale of what the Israeli newspaper Haaretz had described as the “largest helicopter sale of the decade”, involving both Apache and Blackhawk attack helicopters).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>In a separate report, Amnesty revealed the findings of its delegation’s visit to the Occupied Territories (October 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 2000), to investigate the use of force by Israeli security forces). According to the report, there has been a repeated resort to “excessive use of force in circumstances in which neither the lives of the security forces nor others were in imminent danger”. And although it did confirm that “some of the Palestinians killed were members of the Palestinian security forces armed with firearms and shooting at Israeli security forces , however, the majority of people killed were taking part in demonstrations where stones were the only weapon used”. Also, according to the information gathered by Amnesty International, “it appears that a wide variety of non-lethal means of dispersal were readily available, but were not apparently used.”</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>  9 Palestinians killed during clashes. According to the organization, “the Israeli government has been using US-supplied helicopters to commit human rights violations during its recent round of conflicts with the Palestinians and the US government must accept some responsibility for how such weapons are used”.</LI></P></UL>

A total of 9 Palestinians were killed (Al-Haq, news update). There were also reports that Israeli forces shelled quarters in Beit Jala, Beit Sahour and the village of Za’atara, using tanks and cohelicopters, resulting in the damage of several houses and the destruction of an electricity generator (Palestinian Center for Human Rights, release).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>UN Commission on Human Rights narrowly endorsed Resolution E/CN.4/S-5/L.2/Rev.1 condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force Israel against Palestinian civilians. It also requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to undertake an urgent visit to the occupied territories to facilitate the work of the commission and take stock of the violations. The resolution also referred to the on-going closure of the Palestinian territories, house demolitions and collective punishment as crimes against humanity. It was adopted by a vote of 19 in favor, 16 against (including the US, Canada, the EU and Israel), and 17 abstentions (Badil, release).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>General Assembly also condemned the violence, and the excessive use of force against Palestinian citizens, by adopting a related resolution by a vote of 92 in favor, 6 against and 46 abstentions. The resolution also expressed support for the understandings reached at the Sharm El Sheikh summit, urging all parties to implement them without delay.  Furthermore, it reiterated that Israeli settlements were illegal, and presented an obstacle to peace, and called upon Israel to abide by its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. </LI></P></UL>

In Khan Younis refugee camp, clashes broke out near an Israeli military post. At least 60 were reported injured. Other clashes were reported in the cities of Hebron, Al-Bireh,  Qualquilia, Nablus, and Bethlehem resulting in the injury of more than 60 people and the death of 3 civilians. In Jenin, settlers were reported to have attacked the residents of a nearby village and to have cut off electricity to it.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><LI>In its final declaration, the Arab emergency summit convened in Cairo, stopped short of calling for breaking ties with Israel (Associated Press).  However, it allocated funds to support the Palestinian population in the Occupied Territories and called for a United Nations-led "international war crimes tribunal" to investigate actions committed by Israeli soldiers during the recent clashes, and requested a U.N. presence in Gaza and the West Bank to prevent future Israeli-Palestinian clashes. Arab leaders were also said to have agreed to end all steps toward normalization of relations with Israel, stopping just short of calling for the cutting of all existing ties. Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the other hand was reported to have informed his Cabinet that Israel would take a "time out" and reassess its position, while continuing with the Palestinian peace process (CNN). </LI></P></UL>
