  Ramallah, West Bank </H2>

<P>Qalqilya <br> In the village of Azoun near Qalqilya, clashes that began last night 
  after the attack of settlers and soldiers on the village are continuing. Ali 
  Sweidan was shot in the head with live ammunition during these clashes and surrounded 
  by Israeli soldiers until the morning. The soldiers prevented Palestinians from 
  reaching him and in the morning he had bled to death from his injuries. Six 
  injuries were reported from these clashes - two of these injuries were live 
  injuries to the head and they are in extremely critical condition. 

<p>In the village 
  of Umm Safa near Ramallah, a Palestinian resident Issam Judeh, 40, left his 
  house at 4:30pm last night in his car. Eyewitnesses saw settlers in an Israeli 
  military car follow him, stop his car and take him to an unknown location. In 
  the morning his body was discovered on the side of a road near his house. He 
  was taken to Ramallah Hospital where doctors revealed that he had been severely 
  tortured with both his arms and legs broken and his skull smashed with a sharp 
  object. He had burns all over his body and his car was also found burnt, outside 
  of the village. During the time of his disappearance the village was raided 
  and attacked by settlers. 

<p>In Nablus area, settlers last night isolated and surrounded 
  the villages of Salem, Beit Fouriq and Beit Dajan. They attacked these villages 
  and prevented anyone from entering or leaving. No further details available 
  at this point. Also in Nablus city, thousands of Palestinians marched to the 
  offices of UNRWA and handed the Director of the Nablus office a letter addressed 
  to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan demanding the intervention of the UN to protect 
  Palestinians from Israeli settlers and attacks by soldiers. In the Northern 
  entrance of Nablus near the village of Beit Eba, clashes erupted and Israeli 
  soldiers and at least 5 injuries have been reported from live ammunition. In 
  Hiwara, a village to the south of Nablus, a curfew continues for the second 
  day.

<p> Marches today in all of the major Palestinian towns and villages were held 
  in support of Palestinians in Nazareth who have been under attack by Israeli 
  citizens for the last two days. These attacks have resulted in the deaths of 
  two Palestinians. In Nazereth today, funerals were held for Issam Yazbaq and 
  Omar Akkawi who were killed last night by Israeli citizens. Nazareth is still 
  closed by Israeli police who are preventing people from entering or leaving 
  the city. More attacks have been carried out by Israeli citizens with no intervention 
  by Israeli police.

<p> In Ramallah, the funeral of Abdul Hameed Taya Abdul Hammed 
  who died yesterday from earlier clashes was held today. During this funeral 
  the news about the kidnapping and brutal murder of Issam Judeh from Umm Safa 
  was announced after which those participating in the funeral headed towards 
  the Israeli military headquarters in Beit El to protest against the continuation 
  of these murders. Clashes erupted between protestors and the Israeli army who 
  started shooting at protestors. Forty five injuries have been reported and the 
  clashes are continuing at the moment.

<p> In Gaza, the funeral of Yusef Khaled, 
  killed yesterday, was held today. Protest marches followed the funeral.

<p> In Hebron, 
  the Israeli-imposed curfew within the Israeli-controlled areas continues. The 
  Palestinian Red Crescent Society has reported 54 injuries in Gaza and the West 
  Bank including Jerusalem from today. Many of these have been sustained from 
  live ammunition. The number is expected to rise and reports of clashes are coming 
  in from all around the West Bank and settlers for the third day in the row under 
  the protection of Israeli soldiers are cutting off roads and attacking Palestinians. 
  In 1948 areas a general strike is currently underway in protest against the 
  murders last night in Nazareth. There is a demand from Follow-Up Committee for 
  Arab Affairs in Israel addressing the UN and the international community to 
  call for UN and international protection of Palestinian citizens both in the 
  Occupied Territories and Israel itself. <BR>
