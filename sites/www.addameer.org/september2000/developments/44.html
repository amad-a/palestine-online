  Ramallah, West Bank </H2>



<p>28 October marks one month since the provocative
visit by Israeli Likud MK Ariel Sharon to the Al
Aqsa Mosque compound, and one month of
unprecedented violence in the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and 1948 Palestinian areas.  At least 130
Palestinians have been killed and over 6000
injured.  A strict Israeli imposed internal
closure remains in place on all of the West Bank
and Gaza.  Thousands of Palestinians have been
prevented from reaching their place of work, and
a large majority of Palestinian children are
unable to reach their schools as result of the
closure.  At least 700 Palestinians from the West
Bank, Gaza and 1948 Palestinian areas have been
arrested by the Israeli Authorities within the
past month.  

<br><br>Aziz Youssef Ibrahim Tannah, 32 years old, a
correspondent and director of the Bethlehem
office of WAFA, the official Palestinian news
wire, died this morning in Jordan as a result of
injuries sustained 2 weeks ago from live
ammunition to his chest.  He was transferred to
Jordan for immediate medical attention, which
proved unsuccessful.  He was later declared
clinically dead, and died this morning in
hospital in Jordan.  

<br><br>Abdel Rahim Hasan Basharat, 35 years old from
Tammoun village near Jenin, who was reported
missing earlier, was found dead late this evening
by a nearby settlement, shot and with evidence of
torture on his body.  

<br><br>Bethlehem<br>
Clashes were reported this afternoon in
Bethlehem, Al Khader, where there were several
injuries, and Hossan.  Clashes continued late
into the evening in both Hossan and Al Khader.  A
large number of Israeli settler attacks were
reported this afternoon throughout the Bethlehem
area, particularly targeting families attempting
to pick olives in their orchards.  Late this
evening, the village of Beit Jala was subject to
unprovoked attacks from the nearby settlement of
Gilo, with the Isaeli army firing heavy machine
gunfire at residential areas, including at the
Talitha Kumi school in the north of Beit Jala. 
Israeli attacks last night resulted in severe
damage to a number of homes in Beit Jala.  

<br><br>Gaza<br>
Clashes erupted this afternoon in Gaza after the
funeral of 23 year old Jaber Ahmad Jaber Al
Mishal from Beach Camp, who was shot and killed
yesterday as a result of live ammunition to his
chest.  Clashes taking place at the Beit Hanoun
crossing today resulted in at least 3
Palestinians injured from live ammunition.  In
Mentar (Karni Crossing), clashes went on late
into the evening, with at least 5 Palestinians
injured from live ammunition.  Clashes in Deir Al
Baleh, near the Israeli settlement of Kfar Darom,
resulted in at least 10 Palestinians suffering
from injuries from live ammunition.  In Khan
Younis, near the Tufah Checkpoint, 22
Palestinians were injured as a result of live
ammunition.  Clashes in Rafah occurred today near
the Egyptian border, with at least 3 Palestinians

Clashes erupted this afternoon throughout the
Jenin area, with at least 30 Palestinians injured

Mohammad Abu Farha, is in extremely critical
condition.  Fadi Amin Mohammad Dabaya, 20 years
old from Jenin Refugee Camp, who was in critical
condition yesterday, was announced clinically
dead today as a result of live ammunition to his
head.  In the nearby village of 'Arrabi, at least
5 Palestinians were injured from live ammunition
during clashes.  The Israeli military opened fire
this afternoon using heavy machine guns at
residential areas in Jenin, provoking Palestinian
police to fire back.  Palestinian security
sources stated this evening that the Israeli
military has threatened to shell the headquarters
of the Palestinian Security Forces in the center
of town, and has warned Palestinian civilians to
evacuate the area.  Electricity was cut off from
a suburb of Jenin, after which heavy machine gun
fire was reported.  

<br><br>The body of Abdel Rahim Hasan Basharat, 35 years
old from Tammoun village near Jenin, who was

Shalala Street in Hebron, female school teachers
were attacked by Israeli soldiers and settlers,
and prevented from reaching the school.  The
curfew imposed on Israeli controlled parts of
Hebron remains in place for the 4th week.  As a
result of the curfew, at least 30,000 Palestinian
school children are unable to reach their
schools.  Although the schools are officially
open, both pupils and teachers are prevented from
reaching the schools, effectively closing all
schools in Hebron.  In the nearby village of
Yatta, the Israeli military shot at Palestinian

closing off access to the orchards.  Arrest
campaigns by the Israeli authorities continue
throughout the Hebron area.

the lands are closed off to all residents.

one another.  Israeli settlers and soldiers
continue to bulldoze agricultural lands and
