<H2>Latest Developments No. 31 - Saturday 14 October 2000, 11:30PM GMT+2, Ramallah, 
  West Bank </H2>



<P>

The West Bank and Gaza were witness to mass rallies yesterday protesting the recent Israeli attacks on areas
throughout the West Bank and Gaza. Clashes erupting yesterday in Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jenin, Salfit,
Nablus, and Gaza resulted in a total of 217 injuries, 6 of which are in critical condition. Two Palestinians were
killed in Hebron, with another declared clinically dead. 

<P>A breakdown of injuries from yesterday include: 
35 Bethlehem 
30 Hebron 
20 Salfit and Qalqilya 
66 Khan Younis 
49 Jenin 
17 Ramallah, including Samer Soubhi Zayid, 15 years old from Jalazone refugee camp, who lost his leg from the
knee down resulting from live ammunition from heavy machine-gun fire. 

<P>Shadi Mohommad Al Wawi, 24 years old, from Fawar Refugee Camp, Hebron was shot and killed yesterday by
live ammunition to his chest. Shadi was standing on the roof of his home when he was shot. A Red Crescent
ambulance trying to transfer him from his home to the hospital was prevented from moving for over an hour,
during which Shadi bled to death from his injury. 

<P>Mansour Tahah Sayed Ahmad, 22 years old, from Dura, Hebron was also shot and killed yesterday by a
Dum-Dum Bullet to his stomach. 

<P>Ibrahim Mohamad Abu Turki, 22 years old, from Khirbet Qalqa, Hebron, is reported to be clinically dead as a
result of live ammunition to the head shot from the nearby settlement of Haji. He was traveling between Hebron
and his village Khirbet Qalqas getting food supplies when he was shot in the head. Residents of the village
report that Israeli settlers from Haji Settlement have been regularly shooting at the entrance of Hebron from the
settlement for the past week. 

<P>An ambulance traveling from Ramallah Hospital to Alia Hospital in Hebron transferring blood needed to treat
injured in Hebron was prevented from leaving Ramallah by Israeli checkpoints set up along the main roads. The
Israeli controlled areas of Hebron remain under curfew for the 15th consecutive day. 

<P>In Salfit and Nablus, clashes erupted late in the afternoon yesterday. Shooting was reported to be initially
directed at houses within Palestinian neighborhoods in the area, before clashes erupted. Clashes ceased in the
Nablus area early in the evening, with reports from a number of areas of electricity and phone lines being cut. 

<P>Following the funerals of the two Palestinians killed yesterday, brief clashes erupted in Hebron today, resulting
in two injuries. 

<P>In Jenin, Tulkarem, Nablus and Qalqilya mass rallies took place this afternoon in protest of the Israeli closure of
main roads leading to and from all major cities in the West Bank. The internal closure has prevented thousands
of Palestinian school children from reaching their schools and workers from reaching their place of work, with the
Palestinian Authority estimating an economic loss of $10,000,000 US each day the internal closure is imposed. 

<P>This evening, the situation is relatively calm, with residents throughout the region unsure as to what tomorrow
will bring. 

<P>Corrections to previous updates: <br>
1. We reported on 12 October that the Israeli media announced 4 Palestinians were killed and 30 injured in Gaza
as a result of rocket attacks. Upon trying to confirm this, field workers in Gaza stated that no deaths occurred in
Gaza as a result of the rocket attacks.<br> 
2. In Latest Developments No. 30 - Friday 13 October 2000, 5:33PM GMT+2, we reported in the third to last
paragraph that Psagot settlement was in Hebron. This was a typo. Psagot is actually in Ramallah. <br>
3. As a result of the loss of our server for the past two days, some of our updated information has been lost. We
are currently in the process of re-checking the website and updating information as needed. Updates will be
completed by our time tomorrow morning.
