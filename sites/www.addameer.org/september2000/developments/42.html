<p>Bethlehem area<br>
  The village of Beit Jala and nearby Aida Refugee Camp were shelled twice by 
  tanks this evening from the bordering settlement of Gilo. Residential areas 
  in the village of Beit Sahour were shelled once by tank fire and attacked by 
  heavy machine gun fire this evening, burning down one home. No injuries have

  were fired on and prevented from reaching injured residents, injuring two medics 
  in the process. Armed confrontations were reported late this evening in Bethlehem. 
  Israeli settlers attacked the villages of Hossan and Tqu' this afternoon.

  Israeli settler attacks were reported throughout the day in villages in the 
  Hebron area. In nearby Beit Awwa, the Israeli military raided the village, destroying 
  personal property and homes and arresting a number of residents. Clashes were 
  reported in Hebron in the evening. In the old city of Hebron, a number of Palestinian 
  residents were evacuated by the Israeli military and their homes used as new 
  military outposts. A large number of homes have been evacuated in this area, 
  adjacent to an Israeli settlement, and converted into Israeli military outposts. 
  In addition, a number of Palestinian houses bordering Israeli settlements throughout 
  the West Bank and Gaza have been evacuated for weeks now as a result of regular 
  Israeli attacks by tanks and heavy machine gun fire from the bordering settlements. 
  The Israeli controlled areas of Hebron remain under curfew for the 26th consecutive 
  day.

  Intermittent clashes were reported this afternoon in Rafah, Khan Younis, Beit

  Clashes erupted this afternoon in Jenin following the funeral of Nimr Youssef 
  Nimr Mari', 22 years old from Kufur Dan, Jenin, who was shot and killed yesterday 
  as a result of high velocity live ammunition to his heart. At least 33 Palestinians 
  were reported injured. In a number of villages in the Jenin area, the Israeli 
  military fired tear gas into olive orchards where farmers were harvesting olives, 
  forcing the villagers out of the orchards. Attacks on farmers and confiscation 
  of agricultral lands continued throughout the day. A mass arrest campaign by 
  the Israeli authorities of Palestinian residents was conducted in the Jenin

<p>Correction<br>
  Yesterday, we reported that clashes took place in Ramallah at the "'Ma'loufiyeh', 
  where the majority of clashes took place in Ramallah in 1996 after the opening 
  of a tunnel by the Israeli Authorities under the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound". The 
  tunnel was in fact opened alongside the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound. For further 
  information on the clashes in 1996, visit the "On The Ground In Ramallah Website
