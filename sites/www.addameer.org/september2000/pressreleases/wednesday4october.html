<p><b>Israel/Occupied Territories: Amnesty International sends delegates to Israel</b> 
<p>Following the deaths of demonstrators in Israel and the Occupied Territories, 
  including the areas under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, Amnesty 
  International is today sending delegates to investigate the circumstances of 
  the killings and to make recommendations to the Israeli Government. 
<p>The delegation includes Elizabeth Hodgkin, a staff member in the International 
  Secretariat of Amnesty International and Dr Stephen Males, a former senior UK 
  police officer who has worked extensively in training police in Nepal and other 
  countries. Stephen Males has a doctorate in police management and has made extensive 
  studies of sensitive control of public order. 
<p>Meanwhile Amnesty International regrets the refusal of Israel to cooperate 
  with the proposed US-headed commission of inquiry. The organization continues 
  to call for the setting up of a commission of inquiry composed of independent 
  and impartial investigators which should have the power to make on-site visits 
  and question all those involved, including members of the security services. 
  The findings of such an inquiry should be made public.

</b> <b> A nine-year-old child is shot dead<br>
The Israeli Occupying Forces escalate their violations</b> 
<p
Date: October 4, 2000><br>
  Time: 16:00 GMT 
<p>At about 14:00 GMT, the Israeli Occupying Forces shot dead a nine-year-old 
  child. The child, Mohammed Yousef Abu A'asi, 9 years old from Bani Suheila near 
  Khan Younis, was shot with a bullet which penetrated his back got out his body 
  through the chest at the junction of Netzarim Settlement "Al-Shohada' Junction" 
  in one of the most bloody scenes of the Israeli Occupation Forces' crimes. He 
  immediately died. It is another evidence of the crimes committed by the Israeli 
  Occupation Forces. It seems that the child was walking in an opposite direction 
  to the Israeli Occupation Forces, which had no mercy on his childhood; they 
  shot him dead from behind. The child's body was transferred to Shefa' Hospital 
  where he was identified. 
<p>PCHR's field officers at the area of the junction have reported that, in the 
  afternoon, the Israeli Occupying Forces escalated their flagrant violations 
  as they intensified shooting and launching missiles at the junction of Netzarim 
  Settlement "Al-Shohada' Junction," which resulted in injuring ten people. At 
  the moment, in another escalation, the Netzarim Settlement is a source of intensive 
  shooting at Palestinian civilians. Smokes are ascending out of an adjacent steel 
  factory, it was bombed by a shell. 
<p>At the time of writing this release, PCHR has learned that the Israeli Occupying 
  Forces escalated their flagrant violations in the West Bank. Alla' Hassan Barghouthi, 
  24 years old from A'boud of Ramallah Governate was shot dead by the Israeli 
  Occupying Forces. He received a bullet in the chest. In addition, more than 
  50 people were injured today throughout the West Bank. 
<p>Until now, the number of martyrs who were killed by the Israeli Occupying Forces 
  since Thursday, September 29, 2000, has increased to 56, including 17 children 
  and youngsters under 18. Among the martyrs, there are a child who is less than 
  two years old, a nine-year-old child, two 12-year-old children and two 14-year-old 
  children.

<p><b>URGENT APPEAL</b> <B>Israel's War on Palestinian Children</B> 
<p>October 4, 2000, 5:00 PM 
<p>More than 60 Palestinians have lost their lives and 2,000 have been injured 
  in attacks by Israeli forces. Now in their seventh day, these attacks on Palestinian 
  civilian demonstrators throughout the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza have 
  assumed a disturbing pattern. Hundreds of Palestinian children have been injured 
  by the army's indiscriminate use of force and many have been killed. Israel 
  is waging a war against Palestinian children. 
<p>The Ministry of Health reports that since Saturday, a startling 44% of injured 
  patients seen in hospitals in the West Bank and Gaza have been children under 
  the age of 18. The MoH reports that many children have died as a result of injuries 
  sustained at the hands of Israeli Forces. Some of those children are: ¨ Muhammad 
  Al-Dura, age 12, killed on Saturday in Gaza by Israeli snipers. The world watched 
  in horror as television cameras recorded his father's vain attempts to protect 
  him and signal the soldiers to stop firing. ¨ Muhammad Muhammad Bade' Ibrahim 
  Al-Utla, age 16, killed on Saturday. ¨ Iyad Muhammad Al-Khashashi, age 17, killed 
  Sunday in Nablus by a bullet to the chest. ¨ Mohammed Nabil Daoud, age 16, killed 
  Sunday in Al Bireh by a bullet to the head. ¨ Samir Tabanja, age 10, killed 
  Sunday in Nablus by machine-gun fire from an Israeli helicopter. ¨ An unidentified 
  16-year-old boy, killed on Monday in Nablus. ¨ Omar Muhammad Abdel-Rahman Suleiman, 
  age 18, killed Tuesday. ¨ Ammar Khaled, age 18, killed Tuesday. 
<p>Specific cases of children injured by Israeli assaults vividly illustrate the 
  brutal force used against the Palestinians. For example, Ala' Imad from Jerusalem, 
  age 12, sustained extensive injury to her eye when she was hit by a rubber bullet. 
  The bullet perforated her eye twice and caused numerous bone fractures. The 
  bullet became lodged in her sinus and could be seen in the upper jaw, protruding 
  behind the teeth. 
<p>10-year-old Muhammed Jabar Raafi was killed in the Gaza Strip, shot in the 
  head with an explosive high-velocity bullet. This type of bullet shatters upon 
  impact to inflict the greatest possible damage and is outlawed by international 
  conventions. 
<p>The youngest victim, one-and-a-half-year-old Sara Abdel-Azeem, was killed in 
  Nablus when Israeli settlers shot at her father's car. 
<p>Children have been disproportionately affected by Israel's deplorable attacks 
  against unarmed Palestinian civilians. The UPMRC urges the international community 
  to condemn Israel's violent acts, particularly against children.

  army's use of force against Palestinians over the past seven days, visit the

<h2>LAW Demands That Israel Be Tried In the International Criminal Court for War 
  Crimes</h2>
<p>October, 4, 2000 
<p>For the sixth consecutive day, the Israeli Occupation Forces continued their 
  aggressive and lethal actions against Palestinian civilians. 56 Palestinian 
  civilians have been killed by Israeli Occupation Forces since the beginning 
  of the violence on Friday September 29, 2000. The four killed today are: Muhammed 
  Fauzi Al Sarkhi, 22, from al Sawahre Jersualem, Mamoud Ibrahim Emwasi, 23, from 
  Betuina, Ramallah, both shot when Israeli Military Forces attacked them at dawn 
  in Betunia, and Ala Hassan Jabber Al- Barghuthi, 24 from Abud, Ramallah, shot 
  in the chest by soldiers in Beit El near the City Inn. In Gaza, 12-year-old 
  Muhhamed Yousef Abu Asi from Beni Suhaila, was shot in the chest by a bullet 
  fired at him at the Shuhada Triangle, near the Netzarim Settlement. 
<p>Israeli Helicopters continued firing at civilians with 500 mm machine guns 
  and Israeli Occupation Forces bombed an iron factory with rockets fired from 
  the air and land. In a disturbing development, settlers from the Netzarim settlement 
  fired at civilians as well, with out the intervention of the Israeli Occupation 
  Forces. 
<p>According to information collected by LAW's field researchers in Bethlehem, 
  Nablus and Ramallah; Israeli snipers are using silencers when shooting at Palestinians. 
  Direct hits are only noticed after ambulances arrive to collect the dead and 
  injured. It was also reported that the Occupation Forces left the City Inn in 
  Ramallah, only to situate themselves at Occupation Headquarters nearby. They 
  are reported to have installed new fortified protective barriers from which 
  they fire at Palestinian civilians. 
<p>The Israeli Occupation Forces continue their fierce attacks against the Palestinian 
  civilians despite international outcry. Their actions are in direct violation 
  of international law, specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
<p>LAW would like to reiterate the following: 
<ol>
  <li>The Israeli occupation forces are using fatal force against Palestinian 
    demonstrators. This is illegal under international law 
  <li> Israeli Settlers are firing at Palestinian civilians without intervention 
    by the Israeli Occupation Forces. 
  <li> The Israeli Government alone is responsible for this massacre and for the 
    rising tension in the occupied territories. 
  <li> LAW strongly denounces the actions taken by the Israeli occupation forces 
    against unarmed Palestinians. 
</ol>
<p>In light of the above, LAW demands the following: 
<ol>
  <li> A total cessation of the lethal aggression carried out by the occupying 
    power against Palestinian residents. 
  <li> The formation of an international investigation committee to investigate 
    the crimes that are being committed by the Israeli occupation authorities 
    in the Palestinian territories and bringing those responsible for trial. 
  <li> That those responsible for these crimes be tried in the International Criminal 
    Court of Justice. 
  <li> Calls on the international community to pressure the Israeli Government 
    to bring it to compliance with UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 
    and to totally withdraw from the occupied territories including East Jerusalem. 
  <li> LAW calls for international protection against the Israeli occupation troops 
    in the occupied territories. 
  <li> LAW calls on the international, regional and local human rights organizations 
    to denounce Israeli violations and aggressive policies.

<H2>The Union of Health Work Committees</H2>
<p>Dear Friends, 
<p>The incidents of the last 7 days show us clearly the fragility of the entire 
  situation in the occupied territories. Public perception of Middle East "peace" 
  has been shattered by reports of intense violence, bloodshed and death. At some 
  level, the present reality differs from the Intifada of 1987 - 1993. At another 
  level, however, it is similar. 
<p>The use of live ammunition and heavy artillery (helicopters, 500 mm machine 
  guns, anti-tank missiles and Lao Missiles) is new. The manner of shooting is 
  different - mostly direct shots by snipers aiming at the head and chest. In 
  many cases, shots were fired at random regardless whether the victim is a Palestinian 
  policeman or a child. Israeli soldiers have been choosing their targets from 
  a "safe" distance. 
<p>It is impossible to forget the picture of young Mohammed hiding with his father 
  behind a barrel. The boy is screaming, holding on to his father and the father 
  is shouting and waving with his hands to stop shooting. The astute French cameraman 
  had ample time to film the entire devastating story. Seconds after sudden, direct 
  shots raised the dust and blurred vision, Mohammed lay dead on the lap of his 
  father, who himself had been immobilized by 8 bullets. The father survived. 
  The paramedic who hurried to help both was immediately shot dead. 
<p>In seven days, 64 people have been killed, 54 Palestinians from the West Bank 
  and Gaza, and 10 Palestinians inside Israel. Over 2000 have been injured, many 
  of them children. According to Ministry of Health statistics, 33% of the casualties 
  are children. In statistics compiled by Nasser Hospital in Gaza on 1 October 
  2000, there had been 40 casualties, 24 of whom under 18 years of age. Eleven 
  had been shot with "rubber" bullets, 16 with live ammunition, and 13 victims 
  of tear gas. Twelve people have been shot in the head, 2 in the chest, 4 in 
  the abdomen and 19 in the limbs. In Gaza's Shifa Hospital, reports from 30 September 
  2000 indicate the following: 110 casualties (46 children, 64 adults). Of these, 
  19 had been shot with "rubber" bullets, 62 with live ammunition and 29 victims 
  of tear-gas. Thirty-two had been shot in the head, 8 in the chest, 3 in the 
  abdomen, and 32 in the limbs. 
<p>The Israeli Occupation forces shot at ambulances, thus preventing them from 
  reaching the wounded. Paramedics and physicians have been injured. Physicians 
  are continually prevented from reaching their workplaces. A UHWC anesthesiologist 
  at the Beit Sahour Medical Center was prevented from getting to work and was 
  forced instead by the Israeli soldiers to clean the street. The house of the 
  physician Tayseer Zahdeh in Halhoul, has been occupied by Israeli soldiers, 
  using it as a shooting site and wounding more than 90 people. Many houses are 
  being demolished by rocket attacks and many others are being damaged by bullets, 
  even inside the bathrooms. In addition, many families who live in "border areas" 
  are being moved out of their homes and forced to stay with family or friends. 
<p>The wave of violence is seemingly endless. When the shooting ends, the grief 
  and pain will most certainly be overwhelming as we start counting our dead and 
  injured. 
<p>All Palestinian cities are under siege. The first signs of shortages are evident 
  in fuel, heating diesel oil and medication. Electricity has been cut from the 
  village of Husan. News that Israeli soldiers are landing on the shores of Gaza 
  have been reported on the BBC this morning. Tanks are at the entrances of Bethlehem. 
<p>The Israeli government is solely responsible for this escalation and for all 
  the bloodshed and violence. All 64 victims have been killed with live ammunition 
  and "rubber" bullets, and using tanks and helicopters. This suffering must stop. 
<p>As the situation is worsening and the possibility to remain steadfast is as 
  diminished as the reservoirs of medical supplies and medication, we urge all 
  countries and organizations to recognize their role and responsibility to put 
  an end to the Israeli assault. 
<p>We urge you to take immediate action by intervening actively in your countries 
  to end this massacre.

<b>The Massacre Continues: 55 Palestinians Killed by The Belligerent Israeli Occupation 
Forces</b> 
<p>All over Palestine, the Palestinian civilians continue to bury the bodies of 
  their martyrs. 55 Palestinians have been killed by the belligerent Israeli Occupation 
  Forces. 
<p>For the sixth successive day, since last Friday (29/9/2000), the Israeli Forces 
  are still performing carefully planned massacres against the Palestinian civilians 
  both in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and inside Israel itself with equal ruthlessness. 
<p>Israel has dangerously increased the level of aggression in an unprecedented 
  way. Its use of certain weapons against the Palestinian civilians and non-military 
  buildings Is totally out of proportion with the capacity of its victims to retaliate. 
  This is evidenced by the shelling of the houses at Al-Shuhada’ crossroad near 
  Gaza and in Rafah, as well as the use of assault helicopters to attack civilians 
  using a whole range of weapons. Moreover, the Occupation Forces are using the 
  “ Special Forces”, which constitute armed Israeli soldiers disguised as Palestinian 
  civilians, for the purpose of killing Palestinians. These forces were responsible 
  for killing tens of Palestinians during the Intifada ( 1987-1994). 
<p>The belligerent Israeli Military Forces seem to be still determined to kill 
  Palestinian children. 77% of the casualties among the Palestinians during the 
  last five days were children. No one will forget the images of the 12-year old 
  Mohammad Al-Durrah from Al-Bureij refugee camp in Gaza Strip who was savagely 
  killed by the Israeli soldiers. No one also can forget the picture of the 1.5-year 
  old Sarah Abd-Al-Azeem Hasan from Nablus in the West Bank killed by a bullet 
  that penetrated her skull. Tens of similar incidents against children took place 
  away from the journalists and correspondents’ cameras. 
<p>In the light of the highly dangerous situation in the Occupied Territories, 
  AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights ascertains the following: 1. The international 
  community is not interested in the application of the principles and obligations 
  dictated by the International Law. On the contrary, it continues to either watch 
  the situation quietly in acquiescence with the massacres or respond with an 
  insufficient criticism. 2. The United States of America (USA) as well Israel 
  are equally responsible for the massacres. The USA’s position in regard to what 
  is now taking place is clearly biased. Since it continues to prevent any effort 
  initiated by the United Nations (UN) or any other party to stop the massacres. 
  Besides, the USA considers the unarmed Palestinian victims equally responsible 
  for the current situation. Moreover and most important, it continues to supply 
  Israel with the most sophisticated and highly effective weapons. These include 
  assault helicopters, automatic rifles, missiles and even the bullets. 
<p>For these reasons, AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights calls upon the international 
  public opinion, civil community organizations, and religious agencies in Europe, 
  the USA as well as all over the world to exert pressure upon their governments 
  to stop their incriminating silence and fulfill their legal and moral obligations 
  towards the Palestinian civilians.

<b>Child Fatalities in the Recent Clashes</b> 
<p>Please find below our urgent report on Child Fatalities in the Recent Clashes. 
<p>The protection of civilians and children in situations of armed conflict is 
  one of the most basic and vital principles of international and humanitarian 
  law. It is a universally accepted principle that children should not be the

<p>The PHRMG has followed with alarm the growing number of child casualties in

  of four children as examples, and lists a further eleven children (below the 
  age of 18) that have been killed in the clashes. 
<p>Regardless of who is responsible for the current clashes and violence being 
  experienced, child fatalities are a grave violation of human rights and simply

  report is intended to draw attention to the suffering experienced by children, 
  the most vulnerable members of our society, whose right are being seriously

  sympathies for the families and relatives of the children who have tragically 
  lost their lives in the last few days. 

<p>Child Fatalities in the Recent Clashes


<p>Introduction

	<p>The protection of civilians and children in situations of armed conflict is one of the most basic and vital principles of international and humanitarian law.  It is a universally accepted principle that children should not be the targets of military action, and that their safety and welfare should be protected in any situation of armed conflict.

	<p>The PHRMG has followed with alarm the growing number of child casualties in the recent clashes.  Regardless of who is responsible for the current clashes and violence being experienced, child fatalities are a grave violation of human rights and simply unacceptable.  In issuing the following report, it is not the intention of the PHRMG to express a political opinion on the recent disturbances.  Rather, this report is intended to draw attention to the suffering experienced by children, the most vulnerable members of our society, whose right are being seriously and unacceptably violated.  In addition, the PHRMG wishes to express its deepest sympathies for the families and relatives of the children who have tragically lost their lives in the last few days.


<p>International Standards on the Protection of Children in Armed Conflict

	<p>International standards state explicitly that children should never be the targets of any armed action.  The Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention, adopted in 1977, extends full protection to children as civilian from all military actions.  In particular, Article 51: Protection of the Civilian Population, states that:

<p>The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.
<p>The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.

<p>Children are also given special protection in situations of armed conflict under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted 2nd September 1990 and recognized by almost every country in the world, including Israel.  Of particular note is Article 38, which deals expressly with situations of armed conflict.  Sections 1 and 4 of Article 38 state that:

<p>State Parties undertake to respect and ensure respect for rules of international humanitarian law applicable to them in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child.
<p>In accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts, States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure protection and care of children who are affected by armed conflict.

<p>Thus, it is clear that under international humanitarian law, parties to armed conflict must ensure that children's rights are respected and protected, and that their safety and welfare, as well as their right to life, are ensured.


<p>Israeli Army Firing Regulations

	<p>The regulations for Israeli army firing procedures are contained in the "Pocket Booklet for Soldiers Serving in the Central Command", distributed to all soldiers.  Under the regulations, it is required that "firing at women and children will be avoided as much as possible."  It seems questionable whether this "as much as possible" provision is strong enough to fulfill the standards set by international humanitarian law and meet Israel's obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.


<p>Child Fatalities in the Conflicts

	<p>The PHRMG has received several reports of children who have been killed in recent conflicts.  The following cases represent a sample of the child fatalities that have been reported.


<p>Case #1: Mohammed Jamal al-Dirreh, the child who died in his father's arms  in
               Gaza
		
<p>The well-publicized story of 12-year-old Mohammed Jamal al-Dirreh is perhaps one of the saddest incidents of the clashes.  Young Mohammed was killed in his father's arms on Saturday 30th September after they had taken shelter behind a cement block to avoid Israeli army gunfire.  Mohammed and his father were trapped for over forty minutes by heavy gunfire before Mohammed was fatally injured, while his father shouted and begged for help.  Mohammed's father was also shot numerous times and seriously injured.  It is worth noting that the ambulance driver, Bassam Belbeisi, was also shot and killed when he tried to cross the street to provide medical help to the child and his father.

<p>The PHRMG has attained the following testimony on the events from Mohammed's uncle, Na'el Mohammed Ahmad al-Dirreh:

<p>"On Saturday 30th September, Mohammed's father didn't go to work in Israel as usual.  He took his son who had just come back from school to the car market, south of Gaza city, to buy a car.  Mohammed hoped to come back home to Bureji camp in a new car with his father.  The father told his wife before going out to prepare herself and the children for a ride in the new car upon their return.  But the father didn't find a suitable car, so they took a taxi back home, which stopped near the Netzarim (Martyrs) junction because of the Israeli checkpoints.  The father and his son got off the taxi at the crossroads near Netzarim settlement.  They tried to escape the gunfire from the Israeli army [who were there] because there were Palestinian youths throwing stones protesting against the killing at al-Aqsa Mosque the day before, following the provocative visit of the extremist Ariel Sharon to the Mosque on Thursday 28th September 2000.

<p>So the father took his son by the hand and crossed a piece of land to go around away from the clashes, but suddenly found themselves caught in the middle between the stone-throwers and Palestinian troops from one side, and the Israeli army from the other side.  There was very heavy gunfire, especially from the Israeli soldiers on top of the military post.  The father pulled his son behind a cement block and tried continuously to protect him with his own body.  First the father was hit with a bullet in his right leg.  He shouted from the pain and the child cried with fear.  Then the father was shot again in his right thigh, and he shouted for help.  Then the child was shot in his right foot.

<p>They were both bleeding and crying and holding each other.  The child assured his father that he was fine, but the gunfire became heavier and heavier.  The father shouted again and again begging for help, but his voice and cries vanished, and they remained there crying and bleeding for more than forty minutes.  No one dared to come near them inside the circle of death.  The shooting continued extensively like rain.  Eight bullets hit the body of the father, and one bullet hit the heart of Mohammed.  The father could no longer protect his son, but there was no need for it anymore.  He gathered his remaining strength and shouted: "My son has died, my son is dead, please help me!" but no one heard him.

<p>The father managed somehow to use his mobile phone to call one of his relatives (his brother in law, Sami) who was a journalist covering the clashes at that site.  Sami called an ambulance from the Palestinian Red Crescent.  But when the driver of the ambulance, called Bassam al-Belbesi, 45 years, crossed the road to carry Mohammed to the ambulance, he was shot and killed by the Israeli army.  So Mohammed is now a martyr, and his father has been transferred to Amman for medical treatment.  He is in critical condition.  Mohammed's mother is in total shock and suffers from a nervous breakdown."


<p>Case #2 - Samer Tabenjeh, killed by an Israeli helicopter

	<p>12-year-old Samer Tabenjeh died after being shot by an Israeli helicopter in Nablus.  Samer's family said that he loved airplanes of all kinds, so that when he heard the sounds of an Israeli Cobra military helicopter flying overhead, he rushed outside to see it, like many other children in the area.  Outside, however, Samer was cut down by gunfire from the helicopter, which struck him in the abdomen, killing him instantly.  His aunt, who had remained indoors, heard the cries of the other children who had witnessed Samer's death.


<p>Case #3 - Iyad al-Khashashi, killed by an Israeli Sniper 

	<p>17-year-old Iyad Al-Khashashi was found dead in a building near Jerusalem road in Nablus.  It is likely that Iyad was shot by an Israeli sniper who saw him hiding in the building.  It is obvious that the unarmed Iyad, from his position, could not have posed a serious enough threat to warrant such targeting, even if he was throwing stones.  Iyad's body was only discovered after his family spent the night searching for him at all the hospitals and police stations in the area.


<p>Case #4 - Mohammed Nabil Ali Hamed, 14 years old, killed by an Israeli sniper

	<p>14-year-old Mohammed Nabil Ali Hamed was killed by an Israeli sniper at the road junction north of al-Bireh.  Relatives of Mohammed said that he had spoken to his father, who was traveling to Kuwait, only two hours previously.  Mohammed had asked his father on the phone to bring him new pajamas from Kuwait.


<p>Other children and boys killed in the clashes:

<p>Khaled Adli al-Bazyan, 14 years old, from Nablus<br>
Hussam Naim Bakhit, 15 years old, from Balata Camp near Nablus<br>
Nizar Mohammed Eida, 15 years old, from Deir-Ammar near Ramallah<br>
Khaled Hamid "al-Souri", 16 years old, from Rafah<br>
Mohammed Jaber Rabi, 10 years old, from Rafah<br>
Mohammed Nawaf Abu-Owemer, 13 years old, from Deir-el-Balah<br>
Sarah Abdel-Azim Hasan, 2 years old, from Qasra village near Nablus<br>
Wa'el Tayseer al-Qatawi, 15 years old, from Balata Camp near Nablus<br>
Amjad Maher al-Zarei, 17 years old, from Jenin<br>
Musleh Hussein Ibrahim Jarad, 16 years old, from Deir-el-Balah<br>
Sami Fathi Taramsi, 17 years old, from Gaza<br>


<br><br>Conclusion

<br><br>Children are particularly vulnerable in situations of armed conflict.  As such, special care must be taken to ensure their safety and well-being.  The number of child fatalities in the recent conflicts, whether they have occurred by accident, or at the hands of Israeli snipers, are a direct violation of international human rights law and must be stopped.  The PHRMG calls for Israeli officials to recognize their obligations to uphold the rights stated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international standards and take immediate steps to prevent further child casualties.
