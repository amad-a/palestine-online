<b>Palestinian military court issues another death sentence</b>

<p>
In the evening of Sunday 11 February 2001, a Palestinian military
court in Hebron sentenced 59 year-old Colonel Hassan Musalam, a 
member
of the Palestinian National Security Forces, to death by firing squad
after he was found guilty of collaborating with the Israeli
Intelligence Services since 1994. The bill of indictment brought
against Hassan, which was read in a closed session on Saturday 
10
February, stated that he had confessed of collaborating with the
Israeli Intelligence Services from whom he had twice received the 
sum
of NIS 1,800. The bill of indictment also included testimony by a
witness who was himself a collaborator and alleged that Musalam had 
voluntarily collaborated with the Israeli Intelligence.
<p>
The military court, presided over by Captain Fawzi Auda, based its
sentence on Article 131 Paragraph A of the 1979 Palestinian
Revolutionary Penal Code. However, the sentence is subject to appeal
and requires the President of the PNA’s ratification before being
carried out. Prosecutor Nasser Ishish and defence lawyers Samir Al
Tamimi and Tariq Fakusi (appointed by the Court) also attended the
hearing.
<p>
LAW condemns acts of collaboration with Israel as detrimental to the
Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation. However, LAW demands
that individuals suspected of acts of collaboration be tried according
to internationally recognised standards of fair trial and opposes the
death penalty as the ultimate violation of the right to life.

<p>* LAW urges President Arafat not to ratify any death sentences issued
by Palestinian courts.

<p>* LAW calls for the prohibition of the death penalty in the PNA.

<p>* LAW calls on President Arafat to order a retrial for Musalam before
a court operating in accordance with international fair trial
standards.

<b>Israeli army bombs Palestinian residential areas</b>



<p>
For three days running the Israeli army bombed residential areas in
Palestinian towns, especially Al Bireh. They bombed the Jinan and
Satah Marhaba areas, the offices of Al Hayat Al Jadida newspaper, 
the
headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society and the 
Ministry
of Local Governance.
<p>
According to LAW's documentation, at 10pm on 8 February 2001 
Israeli
soldiers stationed at Pisagot (a settlement built on Jabal Al Taweel
east of Al Bireh) began bombing the Jinan and Satah Marhaba areas. The
bombing went on until 3am the next day, causing the following damage:
<p>
* The home of 50 year-old Abdul Salam Al Adasi and his family of
fifteen (including three children) was burnt down.
<p>
* The home of 28 year-old Mustafa Abdul Kadir and his family of six
(including four children). The furniture, entrance, windows and
electricity and water system were all destroyed.
<p>
* The home of 32 year-old Salah Daragmi and his family of five
(including three children) was bombed, destroying the balcony, windows
and doors and severely damaging the walls.
<p>
* The Al Wahidi building, which contains 15 separate apartments, was
hit and the walls, roof and sewage system partially destroyed
<p>
* The offices of Al Hayat Al Jadida newspaper were also targeted,
destroying three windows, two doors and a printing press. In the
editorial suite, six windows, three PCs, a stone pillar, the newspaper
sign and the lights were destroyed.
<p>
* The Palestinian Red Crescent headquarters and emergency room was
also bombed, burning part of the top floor and destroying the
furniture and equipment contained within. The PRC minibus, used for
transporting the handicapped, was also destroyed, as were three water
tanks and the telephone system.
<p>
Israeli forces had already bombed the same places on Wednesday 7
February. On 9 February, they bombed residential areas in Al Balo'a,
northern Al Bireh, severely damaging the Ministry of Local Governance
building, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, and the Fateh
High Command offices.
<p>
According to LAW's documentation of the incident, Israeli forces used
more than 15 artillery shells as well as machineguns in their attacks
on the Ministry of Local Governance and Fateh offices. The 5th floor
of the Ministry of Local Governance building was burnt down, its
eastern façade partially destroyed and the water and electricity
systems destroyed completely. The repairs have been estimated by the
city engineer as more costly than rebuilding the building in its
entirety. This was the 15th time that Israeli forces have bombed the
Ministry of Local Governance building since 29 September 2000.
<p>
The 1949 IV Geneva Convention and its Additional Protocols prohibit
attacking civilians and civilian properties, as well as acts of
violence or threats aimed at terrorising civilians. Article 33 of the
IV Geneva Convention stipulates:
<p>
"No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not
personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures
of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited. Pillage is prohibited.
Reprisal against protected persons and their property are prohibited."
Article 53 prohibits destroying property, stating:
<p>
"Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property
belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the
State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative
organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is
rendered absolutely necessary by military operations."

<p>Article 51 of Protocol 1 (Protocols Additional to the Geneva
Conventions) prohibits attacking civilians. Articles 18, 19, and 20 of
the IV Geneva Convention prohibit attacking hospitals and medical
centres.

<p>LAW demands:

<p>* The Israeli Government to immediately stop the use of excessive and
indiscriminate force and collective punishments against Palestinian
civilians.

<p>* The establishment of an international investigation committee based
on United Nations Security Council resolutions 1322 of Oct 7, 2000, to
investigate the violations of international humanitarian law committed
by the Israeli forces inside the occupied Palestinian territories.

<p>* The international community must hold a conference for the High
Contracting Parties of the Fourth Geneva Convention in order to take
practical measures to ensure Israel's adherence to the convention.

<p>* The international community must pressurise Israel to immediately to
immediately put an end to the occupation of the Palestinian
territories and effectively support the implementation of the
Palestinian right to self-determination.

<h3> <a name="hra">Arab Human Rights Association</a></h3>
<b>Reactions to the Arab Boycott</b>
<p>
The Arab Minority in Israel affirmed its solidarity through the
decision of boycotting the Israeli Prime Minister Elections, or
casting a blank ballot. This decision was a reaction to  “Black
October” events. People from Upper Galilee to the unrecognized
villages in the Negev felt so isolated from the Israeli community and
therefore, a call for unity was heard.
<p>
Commentators and Columnists in the Arabic newspapers of this 
week,
express their thanks in different ways to the Arab voters who either
chose not voting or voting for none of the two candidates (blank
ballot).
<p>
Azmi Bechara in Fasl Al-Maqal sees the Elections’ results as “an
“Earthquake” which is an indication of the important turn in the
Patriotic Awareness and the Awareness of the citizenship of Arab
minority in Israel”
(9 February).
Bechara refuses as well the claim that the boycott will lead to
National Isolation of the Arab community, but on the contrary it will
lead to a new turn in self-esteem.
<p>
Al-Sabar’s editorial resembles this election to the one after the
“Land Day clashes”, 25 years ago, when Arab people contributed in
having the Labour party out of government. But the author wonders if
this boycott will be a “passing protest step where its main aim is to
punish Ehud Barak,” or is it “a beginning of new era away from the
Labour party?” (February 7th).
<p>
The poet Samih Al-Qasem in the editorial of kull Al-Arab, is amazed at
the Israeli attitude towards the Arab’s choice. His editorial’s title:
“once more- Arab you are responsible”, where he refers to the Israeli
Left such as Yossi Sarid who claimed in the Israeli television on the
election day “that Arabs are the main reason of Barak’s fall and
Sharon’s victory”, while Amos Oaz -an Israeli writer- do not hesitate
in saying that “Sharon, is Arafat’s gift to the Israeli people and to
the Palestinians as will”. But towards the end, Al-Qasem do not forget
to thank his readers for their political awareness.
<p>
On the other hand, Al-Ein, Al-Ittihad and Al-Sinnara, refer to this
subject in a different manner. Salem Jubran claims that “the Arab
parties committed a crime by calling for boycotting or casting a blank
ballot, firstly cause it helped the Likud party success, and secondly
by asking people to give up their right of voting”. Al-Ittihad columns
see “the boycott as a passive act and wish that the Arab voters will
not get used to it”. However Al-Sinnara’s editorial thinks that Arab
leaders who called for boycott, wish inside themselves that this act
will be for once only.

<p>

The Parents committee of “Black October’s” Victims.
<p>
One of the important voices of boycotting the Israeli election was
heard from the Parents Committee of “Black October’s” victims. Mahmod
Yazbek, Uncle of the victim Wessam Yazbek from Nazareth stated in his
interview in Al-Sabbar, “we asked for boycotting but not casting a
blank ballot in order to punish Ehud Barak for his attitude towards
our children in “Black October’s” events, and towards the Arab
Minority through his rule”. The committee was established after
determination the date of the Election Day. The Committee reacted to
the boycott in a statement titled “a call for Dignity”. Where it
thanks Arab Minority in “punishing the Executioners of their
children”.

<p>
On the other hand, “Adalah”, the Legal Center for Arab Rights In
Israel is calling for accepting a member of the Parents Committee in
The Investigation Committee. Adalah’s advocates Mr. Hassan Jabarin and
Mr. Riad Anis, came back from Ireland where a 13 persons where killed
by the British Police in 1972. (Al-Ittihad, February 9th). The
Advocates meet with the victim’s parents who struggle for years
against the decisions of the Investigation Committee, which were taken
in 1972, till having another committee on 1998. The important
difference between the two committees that the second one contains
representatives from the Parent’s committee. Mr. Jabarin stated that
their main aim is learning from the similarity of the two events in
order to achieve better results.

<p>
Kul Al-Arab published in its last issue that an IDF soldier changed
his testimony regard Rami Garah who was killed in “Black October” in
Jat village. The soldier admitted that Garah did not participate in
the clashes and wasn’t a threat to Police that day, as he claimed in
his first testimony.

<b>DISCRIMINATION IN COURT</b>
<p>
Tomorrow, 13 February, at 8:30 A.M., human rights supporters will 
hold
a demonstration at the Jerusalem District Court in protest against 
the
sentence imposed on Nahum Korman
<p>
Nahum Korman killed Hilmi Shusha, a twelve-year-old Palestinian, by
kicking him in the head. District Court judge Ruth Orr found him
innocent, despite eyewitness testimony and the results of the autopsy
performed by Prof. Hiss at Israel’s forensic medicine center, in
Abu-Kabir. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision,
convicted Korman of manslaughter, and returned the case to the
District Court for sentencing. The State Attorney’s Office
surprisingly agreed to a plea bargain in which Korman would be
sentenced to six months community service, fifteen months’ probation,
and payment of  NIS 70,000 compensation to the victim’s family.
<p>
Judge Orr’s decision to accept this outrageous plea bargain continues
Israeli law enforcement policy, which extends from the police and army
to the State Attorney’s office and courts and the President’s office.
For many years, these authorities have ignored cases where Israeli
have injured innocent Palestinians, and have even justified the
perpetrators. This attitude stands in stark contradiction to the
authorities’ response to cases where Palestinians harm Israelis. In
these cases, the system suddenly operates forcefully and efficiently
and employs all available means, including flagrant human rights
violations.

<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, at 8:30 A.M., the District Court will convene a
hearing on the community service imposed on Korman. At that time,
members and supporters of the above-mentioned human rights
organizations will demonstrate, in protest of the sentence, opposite
the Jerusalem District Court building, located on Salah-a-Din Street.

<b>Al-Haq Condemns the Israeli Practices of Willful and Extra 
Judicial Killing and Calls Upon the UN Human Rights 
Commission to Stress the Need for Immediate UN 
Intervention to Protect Palestinian Civilians</b>
<p>
 

Today, 12 February 2001, at 6:30 am the Israeli Occupying Forces 
killed Ziad Ali Mohammad Abu Sowai, age 24, from al-Khader 
near Bethlehem in cold blood. According to eyewitnesses, Israeli 
forces positioned at a checkpoint near the al-Khader schools 
asked the mini-bus in which Ziad was traveling to stop.<p> The 
driver obeyed this order at which time he was told to return to 
where he had come from. The driver turned the bus around, but 
when he was 30 meters from the checkpoint the soldiers opened 
fire upon the bus without giving prior warning, killing Ziad.<p>
In a similar development, Atif Ahmed al-Nablusi, age 23, from 
Rafat near Ramallah was killed at approximately 8:00 am this 
morning when Israeli forces located at a roadblock set up near 
Rafat during the previous night opened fire upon his Ford Transit. 
No verbal warning was given and no warning shots were fired. 
Al-Nablusi was struck by numerous bullets. He was driving 
through an Israeli controlled area when he was shot. The soldiers 
prevented medical personnel who immediately arrived at the sight 
of the shooting from providing aid to al-Nablusi. The ambulance 
was forbidden from approaching the checkpoint for thirty 
minutes. When the ambulance was finally allowed to approach 
the checkpoint it was stopped again and searched by the soldiers, 
preventing the aid workers from providing assistance for another 
thirty minutes. The Israeli Forces also delayed the ambulance’s 
departure for approximately one-half hour at which time they 
ordered the driver to accompany them to the Ofer Settlement 
near Betunia. Al-Nablusi died as the ambulance and soldiers 
reached the entrance to the settlement. In total medical aid was 
delayed for one and a half hours, if al-Nablusi had been allowed to 
receive treatment during this time his life might have been saved.
It should be noted that soldiers at the same location seriously 
injured three other individuals today. Two were shot and one was 
beaten until his back was broken. Al-Haq is currently 
investigating these cases.

Al-Haq views with grave concern the continued willful killings 
committed by Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians. In light 
of the continued gross human rights violations committed by 
Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians al-Haq demands that:


<p>1. The Israeli Military investigate the circumstances 
surrounding the unjustified firing of live ammunition without 
warning at Palestinian civilians. The events of today took 
place at times during which no clashes were reported. Al-Haq 
therefore calls for the trial of the perpetrators of these willful 
killing. </paraindent>

<p>2. States Parties to the Fourth Geneva convention of 1949 
immediately move to provide protection for Palestinian civilians 
living under Israeli Occupation and that they also place 
pressure upon Israel to stop its continued violations of the 
convention as is their duty under Article 1 that calls for them 
“to respect and ensure respect for the present Convention in 
all circumstances.” </paraindent>
<p>3. The UN Human Rights Commission currently visiting the 
Occupied Territories stress in its report the need, in light of the 
recent increased aggression by Israeli forces, for intervention 
by the UN in the form of a protection force provided for the 
Palestinian people.

<p>


Israeli attacks on Al Bireh and Bethlehem on Sunday and Monday 
11 and
12 February 2001 left two dead and many wounded. 22 year-old

<b>WORLD ALLIANCE RESPONDS TO CRITICISMS OF REPORT 
OF INTERNATIONAL YMCA TEAM VISIT TO PALESTINE</b>







<p>
The World Alliance of YMCAs has received some reactions from

individuals and organizations calling into question the report of the

International YMCA team's visit to Palestine in November 2000. In

summary, these reactions have suggested that: <p>· The report is

one-sided, biased, does not include issues as viewed from the

perspective of the Israelis, and is based on views from Palestinians <p>
·

It fails to show concern and sympathy for the loss of Israeli lives<p> ·

It makes no mention whatsoever of Palestinian violence <p>· It is

inflammatory in nature and has cast a shadow of hatred and is

therefore detrimental to the cause of peace and non-violence <p>The 
World

Alliance has written replies along the following lines: The YMCA has

long held the view that if there is to be a settlement of the conflict

in the Middle East, it can only happen when there is justice for the

Palestinians and security for the people of Israel. We are also

convinced that our mission as a Christian organisation compels us to

work for reconciliation between people who are or have been in

conflict. Yet we know that justice is the pre-condition of

reconciliation. Our positions have been developed over many decades of

involvement with the people of the region. The recent report was based

on the visit of an international team who for reasons of time and

circumstances did not also visit Israel.<p> In the past however our

international groups have visited Israel and this is certainly

foreseen for future visits to the region. None of the members of the

recent team has any quarrel with the people of Israel. Perhaps they

will disagree with the methods now being employed in the context of

violence in the region by the Israeli government but the report was

based on visits to villages, towns and cities, and on meetings with

many people who have been victims of Israeli aggression. We have a

long history of service to refugees and victims of war.It has always

been non discriminatory in nature. <p>Anyone who suffers falls within the

scope of YMCA work. It is in this context that our current involvement

among the Palestinian people must be seen. Several international

figures from YMCAs in Europe, USA, Canada, Asia, Africa and Latin

America have visited the YMCAs in Palestine and Israel to study the

situation and to examine ways of a global YMCA response to it. We are

sure that you are familiar with the fact that United Nations

representatives and parliamentarians from a wide range of religious

and ideological beliefs have also visited the region. Other

international NGOs have also sent study teams into the region. The

World Alliance of YMCAs' standpoint on the question of Palestine is

similar to the positions of many organisations. It also does not

differ from what Peace Movements within Israel advocate and argue for.<p>

The international community broadly takes the view that the

Palestinians are the victims of the ongoing tensions and lack the

basic and legitimate right to a homeland and to live in dignity as all

other people and nations. Having said this, we also hasten to state

that our position is not against the Israeli people. We condemn all

violence, Palestinian or Israeli, as a means of resolving conflict.

The death or injury of anyone in conflict is cause for sadness. The

YMCA has always been inclusive. Around the world, it is a model of

people from different religious, economic, ethnic, social and

ideological backgrounds working together to make a better world. We

pray and yearn for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which

will provide the grounds on which Jews, Muslims and Christians can all

live together - with and for each other. <p>Allow us to share an excerpt

from our mission statement: the YMCA "seeks to share the Christian

ideal of building a human community of justice with love, peace and

reconciliation for the fullness of life for all creation". Such a

framework implies that our view of conflict resolution can, and will,

only revolve around methods of dialogue and non violence. <p>The World

Alliance reaffirms that it is unequivocally committed to the cause of

a peaceful, just and lasting settlement of the conflict between the

Israelis and Palestinians.<p> The World Alliance reiterates its

understanding that Israelis and Palestinians must live in peaceful

co-existence. It reaffirms its long held view that Israel has the

right to exist within safe and secure borders. At the same time, the

Palestinians have their right to a state and nationhood. The World

Alliance believes that the peace that is required must be based on

justice for the Palestinians and security for Israel and that both

tasks must be undertaken in parallel.
