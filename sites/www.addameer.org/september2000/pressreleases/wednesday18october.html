<b>The Israeli occupation forces continue their aggression against Palestinian 
  civilians: A child is wounded in the head, and an ambulance driver is wounded 
  in the knee</b> 
<p>  Since the morning, 
  the Israeli occupation forces continued shooting towards Palestinian civilians 
  in several areas of the Gaza Strip. More than 16 Palestinian civilians were 
  wounded in the vicinity of the settlement of Kfar Darom near Deir El-Balah, 
  including the child Ismail Mohammed Abu Jayyab, 13 years old, from Deir El-Balah, 
  who was wounded by a bullet in the head, and was evacuated to Shifa' Hospital 
  in Gaza in a critical condition. A driver of a UN ambulance, Mohammed El-Danaf, 
  47 years old, was also wounded by a bullet in the knee, while he was relieving 
  the wounded. <p>PCHR's field officer in Deir El-Balah reported that the Israeli 
  occupation forces used live ammunition against youth and children, and that 
  he saw some people, including the child Abu Jayyab, being wounded without hearing 
  the sounds of shooting, as the Israeli occupation forces used silencers. The 
  PCHR's field officer added that Jewish settlers threw stones towards Palestinian 
  cars, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces, and that they also 
  participated in aggressions against Palestinian demonstrators. <p>In Khan Yunis, 
  clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation 
  forces near the Israeli military outpost, known as "Al-Nouria Outpost," to the 
  west of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis. PCHR's field officer in Khan Yunis reported 
  that the Israeli occupation forces used tear gas against demonstrators and the 
  adjacent houses to the Israeli military outpost. As a result, dozens of Palestinian 
  civilians, including some children, were hurt due to inhaling tear gas.<p> In the 
  area of Erez to the north of the Gaza Strip, clashes broke out this morning 
  between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces which responded 
  using tear gas bombs. PCHR's field officer in the area reported that a tear 
  gas bomb hit and damaged an ambulance of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. 
  <p>In Rafah, PCHR's field officer reported that sounds of shooting and explosions 
  were heard last night in the area adjacent to Salah El-Din Gate on the borders 
  with Egypt. The PCHR's field officer added that 3 people were wounded by splinters 
  of shells unleashed by the Israeli occupation forces, and that facades of two 
  houses were damaged. <p>The Israeli occupation forces continued to reinforce their 
  presence in the Gaza Strip. Yesterday afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces 
  established a new military outpost on a 2-donum area near Kissufim Road which 
  links Gush Qattif Settlement Block with the Green Line. Eyewitnesses stated 
  that two tanks in addition to a large number of troops were deployed in the 
  new military outpost, and that Israeli military patrols were seen moving along 
  the mentioned road. It is worth mentioning that the new Israeli military outpost 
  is the forth of its kind along the road leading to Kissufim Border Crossing 
  between the Gaza Strip and Israel. <p>The Israeli occupation continue to impose 
  a total siege on the occupied Palestinian territories, and Gaza International 
  Airport is still closed contrary to the Israeli claims that it was reopened 
  this morning.

<h3>The Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace</h3>
<b>

It is Time for International Protection for the Palestinian People<br>
It is Time for a Complete Israeli Withdrawal</b>


<p>Dear Friends,

<p>We thank the honorable friends throughout the world that stood in 
steadfastness with the Palestinian people as they face, with bare hands, 
Israel's military machine and extremist settlers. We gratefully appreciate 
your solidarity with the just cause of our people who have been 
fighting for dignity, independence and freedom against thirty-three years of 
belligerent occupation.

<p>We salute the braves in the Israeli peace movement who held firm to the 
struggle for a just and permanent peace driven by a certainty that a 
prompt end to the Israeli occupation is the only option to achieve peace 
and peaceful co-existence in this part of the world.

<p>Dear Friends,

<p>Since it inception, the Barak government represents the Center of 
Israel's political mainstream. This government proved beyond doubt it only 
wants to impose its own concept of peace on the Palestinian people and 
the Arab World in accordance with Israeli conditions. Barak's government 
is influenced by remnants of the dying ideology of Greater Israel and 
driven by a conceited military might of a super power believing that it 
can coerce the region into accepting its custom-made designs.

<p>The course championed by Barak poses a real threat to the concept of 
peace in the region. This also poses a grave danger to the Israeli 
society. It would weaken Israeli peace movement and intensify extremist and 
radical Israeli forces. The Israeli government does not want to see an 
independent Palestinian state. Rather, it wants a disfigured 
protectorate with a permanent presence of its occupation forces on Palestinian 
soil under alleged security pretences. Israeli politicians do not 
recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine and do not wish to recognize 
Palestinian refugees' right to return although they form a majority of 
the Palestinian people. Instead, the current Israeli government reneged 
its own signature on several transitional agreements. In the current 
muscle-flexing military operation Israel's government hopes to impose its 
self-tailored designs through bombardment, killing and maiming 
thousands of Palestinian civilians.

<p>The Palestinian reaction was obviously decisive and affirmed their wish 
for a just peace. Yet, they will persevere in their struggle for 
national dignity and independence within their own state with Jerusalem as 
its capital and for Palestinian refugees' right to return in accordance 
with United Nations Resolutions 242, 338 and 194.

<p>Dear Friends,

<p>All indicators prove that Barak's government does not wish to carry on 
with the peace process in a manner that would accede to the minimum of 
Palestinian aspirations. The Palestinian people have already conceded 
to an historic compromise when they accepted to establish a state on 
1/5th of Historic Palestine.

<p>The policies by Israel's leaders who want to fragment that 1/5th even 
further are pushing the Palestinian people and leadership into a corner. 
These policies are responsible for any form of extremism that may 
surface in the Palestinian society. Israeli occupation with its immoral, 
illegal punitive measures such as willful killings, arbitrary 
imprisonment, house demolition, vandalizing crops, daily humiliation and despising 
of Palestinians driven by Israeli superiority complex, continue 
undeterred. Extremism and violence are a direct result of such practices. The 
belligerent occupation is the root cause of all these tragedies and 
thus it must end.

<p>Meanwhile, and in light of the absence of international will to effect 
implementation of international legitimacy, and the Israeli failure to 
generate a new political leadership capable of making peace with the 
Palestinian people, a ceasefire and redeployment of Israeli troops are no 
more than superficial measures. The situation continues to be explosive 
as long as the Israeli occupation remains and as long as the 
Palestinian people are left alone to face the barbaric Israeli military machine.

<p>The Palestinian people, in light of the horrible situation, calls upon 
the international community of states and the Arab and international 
solidarity movement, to continue with their efforts to end Israel's 
campaign of aggression and terror against the Palestinian people. The only 
approach to ensure this goal is the prompt provision of international 
protection for our people. The international would not only safeguard 
Palestinian lives, it would help the resumption and continuance of 
negotiations and ensure its successful completion. As the negotiations 
progress the international forces would ensure honest implementation of any 
agreements reached.

<p>Dear Friends,

<p>We thank you for the much-appreciated efforts to express solidarity 
with the Palestinian people. Your indispensable valuable role proves that 
our people are not alone under this brutal siege. Let us forcefully 
struggle together for an international protection for the Palestinian 
people. The Israeli occupation must leave.

<b>COMMON POSITION PAPER
OMCT, FIDH, LAW, ARAB ASSOCIATION OF
LAWYERS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS</b> 


<p>Press Conference<br>
5th Special Session<br>
Commision on Human Rights



<p>The Commission has to maintain and to evaluate the human
rights situation according to the standards under its mandate.

<p>The political process has failed to secure the human rights
benefits that are fundamental to a just and lasting peace. The last
two weeks of violence are the evidence of this.

<p>The Commission's position is and should remain that the
advancement of peace in the Middle East can only occur with an
improvement in basic human rights and the guarantees of respect
in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights
law and the relevant resolutions.

<p>The Sharm el Sheikh memorandum will certainly advance the
dialogue between the parties in the peace process but it is not
intended to tackle human rights issues that rest at the heart of the
conflict between these peoples.

<p>The Commission, as the pre-eminent human rights institution,
should not forego its responsibilities but take opportunity to
address the current violence and its causes, and cannot therefore
rely upon this political process to deal with this.

<p>We urge the Commission to establish a human rights mandated
body to conduct an independent inquiry into the recent violence
of the last weeks. A mechanism that can and will be seen to act
justly and thus advance the cause for peace.

<h3>Palestinian Center For Human Rights</h3>
<b> The Israeli occupation forces escalate their aggression on the 
occupied
  Palestinian territories, and reinforce their military outposts in the
                               Gaza Strip</b> 


<p>The Israeli occupation forces continued to shoot fire towards
Palestinian civilians in several areas of the Gaza Strip.  This
afternoon, several areas of the Gaza Strip, specially Rafah, Khan 
Yunis,
the vicinity of the settlement of Kfar Darom near Deir El-Balah and the
area of Erez in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, witnessed clashes
between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces.  
As
a result, more than 100 Palestinians were wounded by live ammunition 
and
rubber-coated metal bullets shot by the Israeli occupation forces.  The
wounded were evacuated to hospitals in Khan Yunis and Gaza.

<p>Clashes in the vicinity of the settlement of Kfar Darom have continued
up to the time of issuing this press release.  Since this morning, more
than 59 Palestinians have been wounded in the mentioned area by live
ammunition, nine of whom are in critical conditions.  In the area of
Erez, 8 Palestinians were wounded by live ammunition and rubber-coated
metal bullets shot by the Israeli occupation forces, and more than 30
Palestinians were hurt due to inhaling tear gas.  According to PCHR's
field officer in the area of Erez, clashes are still continuous there.
In the area adjacent to the Israeli military outpost, known as 
"Al-Noria
Outpost," to the west of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis, More than 50
Palestinian civilians were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets, and
dozens, including some children, were hurt due to inhaling tear gas as 
a
result of clashes with the Israeli occupation forces.   In Rafah, 
PCHR's
field officer reported that the Israeli occupation forces shot fire at
Palestinian demonstrators and wounded two of them.

<p>The Israeli occupation forces fenced an 80-donum area in Al-Mawasi area
in Khan Yunis, near the settlement of Neve' Dekalim on the southern
side, with barbwire, and annexed it to the settlement.  PCHR referred 
in
a previous press release to sweeping the mentioned areas by the Israeli
occupation forces to annex it to the mentioned settlement.  This action
threatens the safety of Palestinian civilians who pass along the way
leading from Khan Yunis to the seacoast as a result of expanding the
mentioned settlement.  The Israeli occupation forces are now sweeping a
jungle area along the public road near the area of Erez in the northern
part of the Gaza Strip.

<p>PCHR is deeply concerned about escalating the excessive use of force by
the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians.  PCHR
observes the Israeli occupation forces' reinforcement and expansion of
their outposts contrary to the claims of the Israeli mass media about
decreasing the friction with Palestinian civilians.  PCHR asserts that
the Gaza Strip is still under total siege, as the Israeli occupation
forces continue to close all border crossings and Gaza International
Airport.
