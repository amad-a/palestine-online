<p><b>AL-HAQ URGENTLY APPEALS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNTY FOR IMMEDIATE INTERNATINAL PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIANS UNDER ISRAELI OCCUPATION
</b></p>






<p>Al-Haq is gravely concerned about the lives of the Palestinian population in the Palestinian Territories, especially in view of the recent upsurge in arbitary and summary executions perpetrated by the Israeli Authorities. As the attention of the world community focuses on the implementation of the so called cease-fire between Israel and the PNA, the circumstances on the ground in the Occupied Territories continue to deteriorate.<p> Since the provocative visit of Sharon at al-Haram al-Sharif on 29 September 2000, the Israeli military have continuously resorted to the use of excessive force, resulting in a marked escalation in the number of deaths and serious injury.<p> This has occurred despite the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights’ Ms. Mary Robinson's visit to Israel/Palestine.<p>Today, al-Haq has documented the second incident in the West Bank town of Biet Sahour, where 3 Palestinians where summarily executed.<p> Israeli Occupying Forces bombed with helicopter missiles a Palestinian civilian car in the town of Biet Sahour. The bombing killed Husain Muhammad Salim ‘Bayyat, 39, a father of 7 children, Rahmeh Rashid Shahin, 53, mother of three orphan children and Azezeh Muhammad Dannoun, 52, mother of six children. Another ten Palestinian civilians were injured, ranging from light to very serious.<p> Summary of today’s events<p>According to al- Haq’s documentation, ‘Bayyat, accompanied by Khalid Salahat, entered their car which was parked at the eastern entrance of Biet Sahour at 12:00 noon today. Shortly after, witnesses saw an Israeli helicopter bomb the car with missiles causing complete destruction of the car. The helicopters were seen circling the area for two hours prior to the attack. In the explosion, ‘Bayyat was killed and Salahat was seriously wounded. Moments later an Israeli helicopter targeted another car driven by Ibrahim Musa ‘Bayyat and Nasir ‘Bayyat, who were accompanying Hussein ‘Bayyat and Khalid Salahat before they got into their car. The missile struck and exploded in an area close to the car killing civilian bystanders Rahmeh Shahin and Azezeh Dannoun and seriously injuring Ibrahim ‘Bayyat and Nasir ‘Bayyat. Jamal al- Wahadneh Yousef Muhammad ‘Allan, Salahiddin Sha’Bayyat and his wife who were in the area were also injured.<p>In a separate but nearby attack, an Israeli helicopter launched a missile at the Palestinian ambulance trying to provide aid to killed and injured people. The ambulance was demolished as the missile exploded near the ambulance. The medical team including Dr. Nidal Salameh, nurse Samir As’ad and the driver Adnan Taha Hmied were injured. <p> Al-Haq confirms that the documentation that has been gathered, comprising Affidavits taken from eye witnesses, contradicts the official Israeli version about the incidents, including assertion that the Palestinians who were bombed where ‘preparing to carry out terrorist act.<p>The evidence proves that Palestinians were intentionally bombed by Israeli military authorities, despite having shown no resistance. Two of the deaths were civilian Palestinian women, who where standing next to their homes in area "A" (Palestinian Authority Territory).<p> Willful killing is an international crime, being a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention which places a legal obligation upon all States Parties to prosecute in its domestic courts those who commit such breaches or order them to be committed (Article 146- 147).Responsibility for these willful killings encompasses the chain of command responsible for the operation. <p>Israeli willingness to use its massive superior military force to target and execute Palestinians inside areas "A" necessarily endanger the entire civilian population and render them utterly vulnerable unless they get international protection.<p> Al-Haq calls on all High Contracting Parties to the IV Geneva Convention to signal to the Israeli authorities that it will not abide death missions. High Contracting Parties can actively communicate this by asking their judicial authorities to open prosecution briefs on willful killings in the Palestinian occupied territories.<p> Al-Haq is committed to make available all its documentation in relation to these matters to those Parties to the Convention who wish to fulfill their obligations in domestic and conventional law.<p> Al-Haq also calls on the international community of states to exercise its role under international law and to adopt effective measures, including economic sanctions, to oblige Israel to adhere to UN resolutions, and to pressure the Israeli government in order to put an end to its aggressive actions in the Occupied Palestinian territory.<p> Such officially sanctioned brutal murders as occurred in Beit Suhour, carried out by Israeli military personnel, must be stopped.<p align=right><a href="#top">return to top</a>

<p><b>DAY 41:
         ISRAELI ARMY ASSASSINATES PROMINENT FATAH ACTIVIST,
TWO OTHERS KILLED
</b></p>



<p>At 11:30 this morning in Beit Sahour, an Israeli helicopter gunship
fired a missile at the car of prominent Fatah activist Hussein
‘Abayat, killing him instantly.  Khaled Salahat, a passenger in the
car, was seriously wounded. The helicopter gunship fired two more
missiles, killing two women - Aziza Mahmoud Danoun Jubran, 58,
and
Rahma Rasheed Shaheen Hindi, 54, Palestinian residents of Beit
Sahour.
 Three other civilians were injured.


<p>In Gaza in Khan Younis, the Israeli army shot and killed Mahmoud
Sharab, 18, with live ammunition during clashes that took place after
the funeral of Mohammad Abu Ghali.  Abu Ghali was killed yesterday.

<p>
LAW condemns the assassination that took place today in Beit Sahour,
and particularly regrets the death of the two civilian bystanders.
Israeli military officials stated today that the Israeli army killed
Hussein ‘Abayat because of his involvement in the exchanges of fire in
the Bethlehem area a few days ago which resulted in the death of two
Israeli soldiers.  This marks the beginning of a new strategy of the
Israeli army – to deter violence through terrorizing a captive
population.

<p>LAW demands that the international community ensure that the
Government of Israel complies with the provisions of the Fourth Geneva
Convention, aimed at safeguarding the rights of protected persons in
situations of belligerent occupation.

<p>LAW further demands the immediate implementation of all UN resolutions
concerning the conflict, and for international protection for the
Palestinian people in the West Bank including Jerusalem, and the Gaza
Strip.
