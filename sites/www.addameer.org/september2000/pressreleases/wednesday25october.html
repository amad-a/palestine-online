<h3>The East Jerusalem YMCA Rehabilitation program 
(YMCA Beit Sahour)</h3>



<p>In the 22nd , 23rd and the 24th of Oct, the Israeli soldiers 
intensively fired more rockets and bullets at the YMCA neighborhood in Beit 
Sahour causing more and severe damage to many houses and created more misery 
and horror to the families and the children in particular. Five people, 
including four children (three from one family aged 8, 10 and 13) were 
injured in these brutal acts, by the fragments of the rockets fired 
from Israeli choppers.  All these children are YMCA beneficiaries, and 
participate in the play and art therapy activities organized for the 
victimized children in the recent clashes.   

<p>Few bullets hit the YMCA building as well, causing more damage in the 
windows, roof and the walls of the Training and Play therapy room. One 
of the bullets settled in the white board used by the children for 
drawing and for training sessions.

 <p>By a miracle, two children saved by moving them five minuets before 
the artillery micelle hit the family house of one of our staff in Beit 
Jala. Severely damaged the house and our colleague's car besides the 
neighbor's houses and properties. 

<p>This new shelling to the houses has caused severe psychological and 
behavioral difficulties to all the children and their families living in 
the area. Many adults have developed psychological difficulties as well. 
This created more difficulties to the YMCA staff in dealing with these 
affected children and families. 

<p>Israel has also placed the Palestinians under severe siege, whereby 
people and goods can not move between cities and villages. This has also 
added more burdens on the people and YMCA staff who works with the 
affected persons as well. 

<p>All these new Israeli measures came after the moderate decisions of the 
Arab Summit Conference, to show more signs on the Israeli aggression 
and brutality against the Palestinian People and that Israel is violating 
all the international conventions. This is an additional indicator that 
Israel is not concerned in any just and lasting peace with the 
Palestinians.

<p><b> Delusions of coexistence in the Galilee:
The aftermath of the events of October among the Arab community in
Israel </b></p>




<p>Ali took a drag on his cigarette and stared at the ceiling. He was part
of the 90% of the Arab community who voted for Barak and his peace
platform. Although proud of his Arab heritage, the previous evening Ali
had talked enthusiastically about his student days in Tel Aviv and the
Jewish friends he made there. 'Their politics doesn't stop us being
friends' he told me. This evening, Ali had seen a man killed in front 
of
him by the military forces of the Israeli society that he had believed
he was part of. Two hundred youths from the neighbouring Jewish town 
had
begun to attack homes on the edge of Nazareth. As a crowd of Arabs
gathered to protect their homes and families, the army intervened to
prevent direct confrontation with the armed Jewish group. Two Arabs 
were
shot dead and over thirty injured as Israeli forces stood with their
backs to the Jewish aggressors. Official sources blame Jewish
vigilantes, but eyewitnesses testify to the fact that the bullets
emanated from the guns of army snipers positioned above the scene. In
the face of Arab land confiscation, housing demolition, education and
employment discrimination, Ali had continued to hold out hope for a
future more integrated society. One night destroyed that optimism,
unleashing resentment and despair.

<p>State forces have killed 13 Palestinians from the Arab community during
the Al-Aqsa Intifada in Israel. 540 have been reported injured and
hundreds more are not seeking help for fear of police investigation.
Jewish citizens have turned against their neighbours, attacks against
Arabs, their homes, businesses and places of worship have spread across
the country from Nazareth to Haifa to Jaffa. Racially motivated 
attacks,
ironically reminiscent of anti-semitic pogroms in 1930s Europe, have
sent a clear message to the Arab community that they are outsiders to
the Jewish state and society.

<p>Targeting non-demonstrators<br>

My neighbour peeled back the tarpaulin to show me the blood covered car
seat. The previous day an Arab family had been driving home when their
car was hit by 12 IDF bullets. The woman in the front seat received 
near
fatal injuries from two live bullets to the upper body. Like many of 
the
injured she was not even taking part in the demonstrations. Another
neighbour was standing on his balcony to watch as demonstrators dodged
live ammunition down our Nazareth street. When the soldiers demanded
that he return inside, he refused to move. They shot him in the chest.

<p>Arabs in Israel began to protest in solidarity with Palestinian anger
over the deaths at Al-Aqsa, but this anger was combined with a deep
rooted frustration at their own status as second class Israeli 
citizens.
<p>Arabs in Israel, families of the minority of the Palestinian community
that was granted citizenship in the state of Israel in 1948, face
discrimination in all areas, from housing to employment to education.
The Israeli state continues to confiscate land and demolish Arab
property in order to build Jewish settlements and highways. The anger
built up in the community was expressed in riots that surfaced in Arab
towns and villages across the country. In 1976 Israeli armed forces
killed six Arab citizens protesting against land confiscation in the
Galilee, but people believed that the current political climate was 
more
tolerant of people exercising their right to criticise government
policy.

<p>They were wrong. Within hours of the protest beginning, Israeli forces
were using tear gas and rubber bullets in an effort to disperse
demonstrators. On the second day, the army was shooting live ammunition
including the internationally outlawed 'dum-dum' bullets. This tiny
bullet penetrates the skin and then fragments, tearing organs and flesh
as it spreads into the body. Injuries were largely sustained in the
upper body and chest, revealing a clear intention to kill.

<p>Sakhnin<br>

Sakhnin is a small Arab town north of Nazareth. Despite its size, it
maintains a very close knit community in which the suffering of 
anyone's
family is shared by all. Political protest is not new to Sakhnin. Every
year, Arabs in Israel and Palestine commemorate the 1976 Land Day that
originated amongst the people of Sakhnin. This March, on Land Day 2000,
the residents of Sakhnin went to protest at the site of the 
construction
of an army base on the edge of the town. Border Police troops attempted
to disperse protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets. Many people
were injured and one woman died after being overcome by tear gas. One
demonstrator remains under house arrest, awaiting trial for his part in
the demonstrations seven months ago.

<p>Despite their experience of political protest, the community in Sakhnin
were not expecting the harsh clampdown of Arab protesters in the
demonstrations of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. 'I was standing by the corner
shop watching to see what the police were going to do' said one woman. 
'
I was with a small group of women and nobody was holding any stones.
Suddenly bullets came whistling over our heads. These could not have
been aimed at anyone else except us, a small group of unarmed
observers'.

<p>Two men from Sakhnin were killed in the demonstrations. ' We believe
that these boys were executed' said another resident. 'There were Arabs
killed in each of the towns and villages across the region, all at 
close
range and in the head or upper body. This indicates an intended policy
to send a fatal warning signal that would personally touch the lives of
every member of the Arab community here in Israel. We as Arabs mean
nothing to the state and any means are used to silence us'. Wafaa, a
teacher from Sakhnin High School, spoke of the devastating effect that
this events had on the children of Sakhnin. Every child knows the two
who died, or has family and friends that were injured. Daily life 
cannot
go on because the situation has changed forever. The students want to
talk about the deaths of the two men, to express their grief and
disbelief. The Al-Aqsa Intifada has made everyone politically aware to
some level. The national situation and the fate of the Palestinian
community in the occupied territories of 1967, has been once more
entwined with the people of the occupied territories of 1948.

<p>Coexistence?<br>

Rasmiyya is the coordinator of a women's organization in Sakhnin. In an
effort to work towards coexistence between Arabs and Jews, she had
organized workshops with local Jewish women's groups to try to improve
understanding between the two communities. The results before the 
recent
crisis were not always positive. 'We talk about cooking and music and
everybody smiles, yet nobody wants to talk about the demolition order 
on
my house' said one woman from the village. 'The Jewish women complain
that politics is divisive, yet this is my life. If these women cannot
face that, and cannot share in the responsibility of their society, I
don't want to know'. Despite the difficulties that Arab women faced in
encounters with Jewish women, Rasmiyya had continued to believe that 
she
could work towards Arab-Jewish coexistence.

<p>Yet now, Rasmiyya feels that pursuing coexistence is tantamount to
accepting a subordinate, dependent role for her community. In spite of
her reservations Rasmiyya spoke at a women's meeting organized by a
Jewish feminist group, two week after the crisis began. Although this
meeting was supposed to reflect a join Jewish-Arab struggle to end the
violence, the meeting was totally dominated by Hebrew language showing
no respect for Arab sensibilities and suffering. 'I don't want to hear 
a
Hebrew protest song' said a woman from Sakhnin. 'It is the Arabs who 
are
suffering. Despite their claims to share our struggle they are trying 
to
integrate us into Hebrew culture and not working to help us live as
Arabs in a tolerant multicultural state.'

<p>Rasmiyya was one of the Arab speakers at this event and for the first
time in her work with the coexistence movement she insisted on speaking
Arabic. The deaths of 13 members of her community have led her to
totally reassess her relationship with the Israeli left wing. She was
disappointed with the reaction of the audience, feeling that nobody
addressed the concerns that she brought from an Arab perspective. 'The
Jewish women's groups have told me that this does not effect our joint
struggle for women's rights. Yet how can I work with them when they
refuse to acknowledge their part in the Zionist society that has killed
13 of my people?'.

<p>Betrayal<br>

The Arab community supported Barak in his electoral challenge against
Netanyahu. He wooed Arab support by promising to pursue the peace
process which had reached stalemate with Likud. Yet under Barak, land
confiscation and housing demolition continued, and now state forces 
have
killed Arab citizens in order to prevent them demonstrating their
dissatisfaction with the government. 'My hand shook when I voted for
Barak but I did it' said one Arab voter from Nazareth, 'Now he has
betrayed us and over and over again I curse the day I went out to
support him'. The events of recent days have led many Arabs to become
disillusioned with Israeli politics of any kind. The prospect of an
emergency government uniting left and right wing, has left many Arabs
feeling that irrespective of small differences in policy, there is no
left and right wing, only Zionist politicians with the aim of 
protecting
a state for Jewish citizens.

<p>No one here has hope of real justice resulting from any Israeli led
inquiry into police brutality. Through their actions the state has sent
a harsh warning that dissent will not be tolerated. Arab citizens do 
not
have the right to freedom of thought and public assembly. Israeli 
forces
have used excessive violence against the Palestinian community in the
territory occupied in 1948, as they have been doing for years against
Palestinians in the occupied territories of 1967, and as they have not
against violent Jewish demonstrators. Despite efforts of human rights
organizations to call for international support for this minority
community, nobody is optimistic about the future. People here have
suddenly grasped reality and it is a state in which they are totally
vulnerable. The state has demonstrated that not only will it fail to
protect Arab citizens, it will support aggression against them.

<p>Nazareth was silent as the sun rose on the day following the attack of
the citizens from Natzrat Illit. Ten thousand people attended the
funerals but there were no more mass demonstrations. Before this
country-wide outbreak of anti-Arab pogroms and police brutality, many
Arabs believed that, despite their status as second class citizens, it
was possible to work hard and achieve a place within Israeli society.
The Intifada of 2000 has shattered that illusion. For the moment the
killing here is over, but the situation of the Palestinians within the
Green Line has now gone way beyond merely the discrimination of second
class citizens. The Israeli state and many of its Jewish citizens have
sent a clear message that Arabs are the enemy within. The community 
must
face the future in this knowledge and nobody is quite certain what this
will mean.

<p><b>Israeli Forces Continue Aggressive Campaign Against Palestinians</b></p>
<p> Yesterday, October 24, 2000, Israeli forces killed two Palestinians. Nidal 
  Ali Dbeiki, 16, from the Al Mudaraj Neighbourhood in Gaza, was shot in the stomach 
  with live ammunition during clashes at Erez Checkpoint, and Nimer Miri’, 22, 
  from Kufur Dan near Jenin, was shot in the heart with live ammunition. </p>
<p>Israeli tanks fired at the Al Kahdouri polytechnic building in Tulkarem. Law 
  is currently investigating the damages. Last night in Al Bireh, Israeli forces 
  opened fire with heavy machine guns on a 2- story building that was under construction. 
  The Palestinian death toll as of today is 123. Of these, 39 are children. The 
  total injured is 5,862. </p>
<p>LAW reiterates the following: </p>
<p>. The Israeli government is fully responsible for the situation that has developed 
  in the Occupied Territories and the violence committed against Palestinian civilians 
  by the Israeli Occupation Forces and Israeli settlers.</p>
<p> . LAW demands that the international community, including members of the United 
  Nations Security Council, take immediate action to protect Palestinian civilians 
  and force Israel to comply with the Fourth Geneva Convention </p>

<p><b>ADC:</b></p>
<p> <b>Hunger Strike Begins This Weekend </b></p>
<p>Twenty Arab Americans will be starting a hunger strike in LaFayette Park on 
  October 28, 2000. They will be joined by other Arab Americans from California, 
  Florida, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and 
  Washington, DC. The Hunger Strike will commence Saturday, October 28, 2000 at 
  10:00 a.m. and will end on November 3, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p> The Hunger Strikers hope that this statement of solidarity will help humanize 
  the plight of the Palestinian people who are being subject to brutal Israeli 
  attacks and occupation of their land. This is a struggle for basic human rights, 
  freedom, and an end to 33 years of occupation and 50 years of dispossession. 
</p>
<p>Dr. S.M. Budron, of the Arab Americans for Peace and Justice, organized and 
  planned this event. Dr. Budron emphasizes that now is the time for all peace 
  loving Americans to protest the blatant injustices against the Palestinian people. 
  Over the past four weeks, more than 120 Palestinians have been shot dead and 
  3,500 injured by Israeli soldiers, policemen and armed settlers. That is a massive 
  loss for a Palestinian population of 4 million living under Israeli control. 
</p>
<p>Silence at this critical time is tacit approval. Therefore, we invite you to 
  lend support to the national hunger strike in front of the White House. When: 
  October 28, 2000 - November 3, 2000 Time: 10:00 a.m. Where: LaFayette Park (Across 
  from the White House) The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) 
  and the Arab Americans for Justice and Peace lend their full support to the 
  Hunger Strike. For further information, please contact ADC (202) 244-2990 or

<p><b>Palestinian Ministry of Education</b></p>
<p><b>Report on Press Conference</b></p>
<p>The Ministry of Education held a press conference today in its offices in Ramallah 
  for local media. Deputy Minister, Dr. Naim Abu Hommos, talked about the general 
  political situation and about the challenges facing the education sector at 
  present. Following is a summary of the most important points he raised. For 
  the past seven years, the Palestinian people have talked about peace and the 
  possible final status agreement. </p>
<p>The Palestinians were deeply frustrated when they discovered that their actual 
  situation on the ground has not in fact changed. Different forms of Israeli 
  oppression persisted and were augmented. The peace process broke down. There 
  are one million pupils in Palestinian schools in the West Bank and Gaza. On 
  30th September the Ministry of Education (MoE) decided to suspend schooling 
  for a week in the aftermath of the eruption of the mass uprising / Intifada, 
  in order guarantee the security and safety of children. </p>
<p>The MoE discussed plans for the continuation of schooling under the ensuing 
  general conditions. Schooling was resumed on 8th October 2000. It was, however, 
  disrupted by the closure imposed by Israel on Palestinian villages, towns and 
  cities (see press release issued on 14th October regarding this subject). Around 
  13,000 students and 500 teachers cannot reach their schools in areas closed 
  by the Israeli military, especially in the city of Hebron where curfew was imposed 
  for the past 22 days. The Israeli army took over a number of schools and used 
  them as military camps or posts. </p>
<p>There were cases when schools were besieged or attacked with tear gas, live 
  ammunition and even with rockets. Most severely attacked was the UNRWA Deir 
  Balah Elementary School in Gaza School which serves 1,951 pupils in two shifts. 
  In response, the MoE drafted an emergency plan giving wide responsibilities 
  to District Education Offices to deal with the situation in each governorate 
  in the way they see most fit. Priority was give to guarantee the safety of students. 
  Some schools had to be moved to alternative locations or had to convene in after-school 
  hours in other school buildings. To date, 29 pupils have been shot dead by the 
  Israeli army and settlers and 1,221 were injured. Many of these were hit outside 
  the areas of confrontation, sometimes while walking to school or back home. 
</p>
<p>Our children are living in fear from Israeli army attacks and from Israeli 
  settlers who attack their homes and towns. The present situation will have deep 
  psychological impact on them. We are looking into the best ways to allay their 
  fears and heal their psychological scars. We are discussing means to help children 
  who will have permanent physical disabilities. We are looking into plans to 
  make up for the lost time and to overcome the lowering of educational standards 
  which will result from disruption of normal schooling. </p>
<p>We demand international protection for our children and for our unarmed people. 
  We appeal to international agencies, especially UNESCO and UNICEF, and human 
  rights organizations to provide assistance to the children of Palestine. We 
  appeal to Arab countries to provide concrete assistance to Palestinian children 
  to help them rebuild and rehabilitate their schools. </p>
<p>We hope that the international community will pressure the Israeli army and 
  settlers to stop killing children and unarmed civilians and attacking their 
  homes and schools, and to withdraw to the June 1967 borders. We hope, as well, 
  that it will support the steadfastness of the Palestinians on their land and 
  to establish an independent state. We will do our utmost to keep schools open 
  and the educational process going on. We have looked into alternative plans 
  to reorganize schools and protect children in case the situation moves towards 
  further escalation or deterioration. Ramallah, 25 October 2000 </p>

<p><b>Democracy and Workers Rights Center</b></p>
<p><b>A Deaf World; War Crimes are committed by the Occupation state of Israel 
  against Children, Women and the Elderly Palestinian People. </b></p>
<p>In the City center of Hebron, there are 400 extremist and criminal settlers 
  living and imposing themselves among 100,000 Arab residents. At10:00 p.m. on 
  Monday dated October 23rd, 2000, The Israeli Occupation soldiers, who are supporting 
  these settlers, started shooting with their machine guns (500 mm) to kill The 
  Palestinian citizen Abdul Aziz Mahmmoud Taha Abu Snaineh (aged approx. 60 years). 
</p>
<p>The wife of the deceased said: "I had a strange feeling during my stay in Jordan, 
  so I came back home immediately to be with my husband, their bullets distorted 
  his face". The martyr's daughter, Amal added by saying, "As the shooting started 
  and penetrated through the walls of the house, the telephone was ringing so 
  I went to answer the call, meanwhile my father asked us to go to the kitchen 
  and we did. The phone continued ringing, we thought that my father would answer 
  it. I went to the living room and found my father in a pool of blood, his skull 
  was crushed and his brain was scattered all over the place. I hugged him and 
  started screaming. My brother had a nervous breakdown and both were taken to 
  hospital. I will never forget what happened, and wish to have the ability to 
  shout for ever"</p>
<p> Furthermore, The intensive shooting and heavy shelling of various types of 
  weapons on the houses near the settlement quarter at the city center of Hebron 
  and the houses in Beit Jala nearby Gilo settlement is aiming at evacuating the 
  Palestinian citizens from their houses. The late events were only a chine of 
  criminal attacks and provocations by the Israeli settlers against the Palestinian 
  residents. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the Democracy and Workers' Rights Center perceives the mechanism 
  for putting an end to these crimes is by securing an International protection 
  of the Palestinian people. Moreover, we call upon all supporters of peace and 
  justice to provide us with International protection, which is urgently needed.
