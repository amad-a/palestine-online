<h3>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section</h3>
<p><b> Article from The Jerusalem Post</b></p>
<p> 31 October 2000

<p>Dear friends,

<p>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section would like to
extend its thanks to all of you who have written letters to "The
Jerusalem Post" to protest their role in perpetuating the myth that
Palestinian adults are to blame for the deaths of Palestinian
children.  Today, "The Jerusalem Post" (print edition) published a
slightly edited article that DCI/PS submitted to counter such
accusations (see full text below).

<p>While DCI/PS is pleased that the article was published, we realize
that there is much work to be done in this regard, and that such
depictions of Palestinian children are not restricted to "The
Jerusalem Post."  As such, we ask that people continue to monitor
the
media and respond to coverage that skews the reality of the current
situation and attempts to further victimize Palestinian children.

<p>FULL TEXT:

<p>(Please note:  This text was re-produced by DCI/PS based on the
article published in the print edition.  The article does not appear
in the internet edition of the newspaper.)

<p>THE ARAB VOICE (Pg. 7)
<p>Children not put on the frontline
<p>Do Palestinians send their children to die?  No, says George Abu
Al-Zulof, Director of Defence for Children International/Palestine
Section

<p>The question of whether or not Palestinian parents send their children
to die at the hands of Israeli military forces is one that is
receiving increasing attention in the international community.

<p>From articles published in The Jerusalem Post, to the discourse
surrounding
comments made by Queen Sylvia of Sweden, the theory offered is that
Palestinian adults use children as human shields in confrontations
with Israeli military forces.

<p>The fact that the international community is entertaining the issue is
disturbing, given its attempt to de-humanize the Palestinian people
and divert attention away from the roots of the problem--ongoing and
systematic abuses of Palestinian human rights, resulting from the 33
year long Israeli military occupation.

<p>The issue highlights Israel's non-compliance with the obligations it
willingly assumed as a party to the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights
of the Child.  Not only has Israel failed to implement the CRC in the
occupied territories, it has failed to submit the required report to
the UN.

<p>The notion that Palestinian parents send their children to die is the
latest reincarnation of a well-known scapegoating strategy known as
"blaming the victim."  It is used to shift attention from the real
causes of a particular issue or act and direct animosity or suspicion
toward the victim, thereby justifying or excusing the violation.

<p>Similar to the rape victim who was wearing a short skirt, or the
battered wife who "drove" her spouse to physical abuse, Palestinian
adults are blamed for the death and injury of their children.
Palestinian parents are accused of placing their children in dangerous
situations, the implication being that Palestinian parents do not
value the lives of their children in the same way that other parents
do.

<p>Such an approach is racist and tends to draw attention from why these
children are being killed and wounded.  Attention is thus turned
towards the parents, and the Israeli soldier who points his weapon and
fires at the child, along with the Israeli government that sanctions
such actions, escapes all accountability. The end result is that
Palestinians are blamed for their own victimization.

<p>SUCH a simplistic and twisted logic provides an easy and palatable
explanation for those children who died during demonstrations, but
fails to explain the deaths of children who died as they were walking
to school or who were seeking medical attention?  Are the parents of
12-year-old Samer Tabanja, who was killed by a Israeli helicopter
gunship in his backyard on October 1, responsible for his death
because he was allowed to play outside that day?  Are the parents of
14-year-old Mo'ayyad Al-Jowareesh responsible for his death because
they allowed him to walk to school on October 16? Moreover, are the
parents of 10-year-old Alaa Hamdan, who died of a severe lung
infection on October 13, responsible because Israeli soldiers refused
to allow them to take her to the hospital?

<p>Moreover, such logic fails to answer why the overwhelming majority of
Palestinian children who died had been hit in the upper body with
Israeli ammunition.  Are we to believe that Israeli soldiers are such
poor marksmen, that they are firing without caution, or that they are
implementing a policy of shoot to kill or seriously injure?  43 dead
children in one month suggest the latter.

<p>Shifting the blame to Palestinian adults also allows for the
downplaying of other violations of children's rights, which are a
result of the ongoing Israeli presence in the occupied territories.

<p>Thousands of Palestinian children suffer as a direct result of Israeli
military attacks on their cities and towns.  Others are virtual
prisoners in their homes, due to a curfew in the area of Hebron.

<p>Over 30 Palestinian schools have been closed, and three have been
transformed into Israeli military installations, effectively depriving
Palestinian children of their right to education.  Approximately
13,000 Palestinian students and 500 teachers are unable to reach
school because of the closure imposed on Palestinian areas.

<p>IN CONCLUSION, it is worth noting that official statements from the
Swedish Consul General in Jerusalem indicate that some press reports
concerning Queen Silvia's remarks were inaccurate.  Moreover, the
Consul General reminded concerned parties of the statement of the
Swedish Foreign Minister of Affairs, which noted that "the extreme
violence used by the Israeli side goes far beyond the bounds of what
is acceptable."

<p>It is indeed regrettable that any child is forced to live in violent
circumstances, but the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip have made this a fact of life for approximately 1.5 million
Palestinian children.

<p>Parents do not send their children to confront soldiers. Such contacts
is unavoidable due to a  military presence in front of schools, homes
and community centers throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  As
long as this continues, both children and adults will continue to be
at risk.
