and machine guns</b></p>
 
<p>
Today 13/12/2000 at 2:00 a.
m. (24:00 GMT), the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces attacked
houses located near Attuffah junction in Khan Younis. In this
context,
<p>Israeli military tanks moved towards the houses, and shelled them
using missiles and machineguns.  In doing so, the Israelis were
trying
to occupy the junction and the houses located near it. It is worth
mentioning that the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces asked the
residents of these houses to evacuate them. The Israeli shelling and
shooting resulted in the injury of more than 40 Palestinian civilians
and the death of several others. <p>The dead were: 1. Mohammad
Jamal Abu
Al’ula, a 25 year old resident of Rafah, who was shot in the chest.
<p>2.
Ahmad Ismaeel Mtair, a 44 year old resident of Rafah, who was shot in
the head. <p>3. Mahdy Mohammad Akkilah, a 35 year old resident of Khan
Younis, who was shot in the chest. <p>4. Jabr Asab’, a 25 year old
resident of Beit Hanoun, who was shot in the head. Several houses were
damaged during the incident.
<p>
The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continued to destroy houses
and bulldoze agricultural lands owned by Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories. Yesterday 12/12/2000, in the evening, these forces
bulldozed agricultural lands and destroyed houses located near Deir
Albalah. These are owned by: 1. Khaleel Basheer: His house was
bulldozed. Besides, 10 dunams planted with tomatoes, pepper, and beans
were destroyed and 50 date trees eradicated. Moreover, the water
irrigation system as well as a plant medication pump were damaged, and
10 beehives were destroyed. 2. Yousif Salman Basheer: His 200 m2 house
was destroyed. 3. Abd Alhameed Altawaishah: A one- dunam green house
was destroyed. 4. Imad Ismaeel basheer: The foundations of his 300- m2
house; which is under construction, were destroyed. 5. Rushdy Abu
Samrah: His houses wall, which measures 6 meters long and 2 meters
high, a garage, and a 20 m2- room were bulldozed.

<p>These new Israeli attacks take place while the Palestinians suffer
from a continued severely tightened siege imposed on their cities,
villages and refugee camps by the belligerent Israeli Occupation
Forces, separating them from each other. We, at AL-MEZAN Center for
Human Rights, stress that the Israeli use of excessive and lethal
force, and collective punishments against the unarmed Palestinian
civilians constitutes a war crime. In the light of this, we request
the international community to end its quietness and indifference in
regard to what is taking place in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories. We call upon all the international and regional
organizations, especially those concerned with human rights, to exert
pressure on the countries of the world urging them to provide
protection for the Palestinians and to try the Israeli war criminals.

The massacre continues: Since the 1st of December, the
belligerent
Israeli Occupation Forces kill 27 Palestinians, injure hundreds, and
bulldoze 500 dunums of agricultural land.</b></p>


<p>
The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have continued to use
excessive and lethal force against the Palestinian civilians in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories. The number of Palestinians killed
by
the Israelis since 29/9/2000 is 289, while the number of those
wounded
during the same period is about 10,000. 27 of the martyrs, including
11 children, lost their lives during the period extending from the
beginning of December 2000 till today 12/12/2000. Hundreds others were
wounded during the same period. This reflects clearly the deliberate
killing policy of the Israeli Occupation Forces; a policy that has
been widely condemned by the international community. The names of the
Palestinians killed yesterday were: 1. Anwar Mahmoud Hamran, a 28 year
old resident of Arrabah/ Jenin, who was shot in different parts of the
body with 19 bullets. 2. Ahmad Ali Darweesh Alquasmy, a 15 year old
resident of Hebron, who was shot in the head on 8/12/2000. The
belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have also continued their
attacks against the Palestinian property. In this context, they have
continued to bulldoze agricultural lands, clearing trees and crops and
damaging green houses, and to shell and damage houses. The total area
of agricultural land bulldozed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since
29/9/2000 is 3,500 dunams. The area of agricultural land bulldozed in
the Gaza Strip since 1/12/2000 is 500 dunams. Yesterday, 12 dunams of
agricultural land were bulldozed northern to Beit Lahia. These lands
are owned by: 1. Ahmad Hasan Taha Ashanty: 5 dunams were planted with
citrus fruits trees and 4 dunams planted with tomatoes and cucumber
(in green houses). In the same incident, the irrigation system was
destroyed. 2. Nasry Shukry Assoury: 3 dunams planted with olive and
fruit bearing trees. In the same incident, the water pump as well as
two stores (which area is 27 m2 ) containing several agricultural
utensils and plant medications were destroyed.<p>

The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have, moreover, continued to
attack Palestinian civilian premises. In this context, 800 houses have
been attacked. Many of them, especially those located near Israeli
settlements and/ or military points, have been attacked almost on a
daily basis. Since 1/12/2000, 40 new houses, apart from those which
have been attacked on a daily basis, have been attacked in the Gaza
Strip. These houses are located near Attuffah junction (Khan Younis),
Salah Addeen border gate (Rafah), Tal Zu’rub military base (Rafah),
and Kfar Darom settlement (Deir Albalah). The Israeli Occupation
Forces not only attacked the houses, but also occupied a number of
them. In this context, Israeli soldiers occupied a house owned by
Husein Al’aidy yesterday. The house is located next to the road that
connects Almuntar/ Karny crossing with the Nitsareem settlement. In
the West Bank, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces occupied the
upper story of a house owned by Khaleel Mohammd Khamees Abu Fannounah.
The house is located in Alhalayiq neighborhood in Hebron (near Hagay
settlement). The 13-member family was forced move from the upper story
down to the ground floor. The Israeli soldiers broke the windows of
the upper story and positioned their machine guns on them. On 10/12,
the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces fired a shell at a “red
Volvo”- model truck owned by Sameer Rajab Ibraheem Alharazeen, 42
years old resident of Ashujaiah neighborhood in Gaza. The truck was
directly hit with the shell, resulting in setting it to fire.
Fortunately, the driver managed to escape the truck a few seconds
before the incident.
<p>
The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have continued to impose the
comprehensive closure on the Occupied Palestinian Territories,
isolating them from the rest of the world on one hand and separating
them from each other on the other hand. A Palestinian woman, Oraib
Younis, a 28 years old teacher, resident of Askar near Nablus, was
prevented from reaching the hospital. The ambulance that carried her
was delayed for two hours despite the fact that she was in labor pain.
The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continue to close Salah
Addeen road, the main road that connects the southern provinces of the
Gaza Strip with the northern ones. This road has been closed since
20/11/2000. Later on, since 5/12/2000, Salah Addeen Road (through the
Alhiker round road) has been opened for a few days, for a few hours
each day. The road is repeatedly prone to closure. The eastern road
(the 86 road) continued to be partially closed. The Israeli forces
open it from 8 a.m. till 4 p.m. each day, but the actual time during
which the passage of cars and travelers is allowed is less than half
of that period. The passengers have been prone to the threats of the
Israeli soldiers positioned along this road, who opened fire on them.
Last Wednesday, 6/12/2000, two Palestinians were injured in the legs
while crossing the road as a result of such shooting. The Israelis
continued to limit the number of working hours (to 10 hours during
daytime only) in the international airport of Gaza and the Rafah
border crossing. Sofa and Beit Hanoun crossings continue to be
completely closed whereas Almuntar crossing is partially closed. This
lead to huge material losses and hindered the movement of passengers
and goods. Yesterday11/12/2000, at 10:30 a.m. (8:30 GMT), the Israelis
closed the Rafah border passage; which constitutes a closure of the
international airport of Gaza as the checks of the passengers who
travel by plane as well as their luggage take place in the border
passage.
     <p>It is worth mentioning that the closure of the Palestinian
     Occupied
Territories has prevented the Palestinian students residing the Gaza
Strip from joining the universities and colleges in the West Bank at
which they study. The separation of the Gaza Strip into two isolated
parts has also prevented thousands of students and teachers from
joining the colleges and universities in Gaza.
<p>
AL- MEZAN Center for Human Rights perceives the continuation of the
Israeli violations to human rights in the Palestinian Occupied
Territories as highly serious. These violations, according to the
international Law, constitute war crimes. In the light of this,
AL-MEZAN requests the international community, especially the high
contracting parties of the 4th Geneva Convention, to fulfill their
legal and humanitarian responsibilities dictated by the above
mentioned convention. They must immediately intervene to arrange for
the application of the above- mentioned convention in the Occupied
Palestinian Territories, and to stop the Israeli massacres committed
against the unarmed Palestinian civilians (that take the forms of
collective punishment, extra judicial killing, and willful killing).
AL-MEZAN stresses that the inquiry committee that arrived in the
Palestinian Territories on 11/12/2000 lacks the conditions and
circumstances, which enable it to fulfill its task in an honest and
unbiased manner. The most important among these conditions is that the
reference/ basis for the work of the committee should be the relevant
UN resolutions, and the international humanitarian law, especially the
4th Geneva Convention relevant to the protection of civilians during
time of war.
