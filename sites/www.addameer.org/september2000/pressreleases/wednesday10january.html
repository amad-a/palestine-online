<b>Freedom of Expression Denied: 
Israel Bars Leading Palestinian Activist from Taking Part in Televised 
Debate   </b>

<p>
Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi, President of the Union of Palestinian Medical 
Relief Committees has been prevented from leaving the country by 
Israeli authorities. Dr. Barghouthi had been invited by the 
German/French television station ZDF/Arte to take part in a 
Palestinian-Israeli debate on a three-hour program to be broadcast in 
Berlin the evening of January 11th. Dr. Barghouthi will not be able to 
take part in the debate because he was denied the exit permit, which 
Israel requires of all Palestinians wanting to leave the country. 
<p>
Barring Dr. Barghouthi from taking part in an important debate on the 
Palestine/Israeli issue is a clear violation of his right to free 
expression * a right continuously and systematically denied to 
Palestinians by the Israeli State. The permit system, closures and 
siege imposed by Israel upon the Palestinian people are forms of 
collective punishment and are illegal according to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention which stipulates the responsibilities of military powers 
imposed during periods of prolonged occupation. 
<p>
We urgently appeal to the international community to insist that 
Israel lift the siege on the Palestinian population and adhere to the 
international laws that stipulate the state's responsibilities as 
military occupier. 
<p>
For more information, contact Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi at +972 
50-254-218 or visit www.palestinemonitor.org.

The Women and Children Weren't Shooting  </b>
<p>
by Rebecca Johnson and Bob Holmes 
<p>
When eleven year old Moath Ahmed Abu Hadwan left the house 
December 31st, he was still wearing the new shirt and trousers his 
mother bought for him in celebration of Al Eid, the end of Ramadan. He 
told her he was going to play in the school yard with his friends 
Abdel, Naji and Muhammed. On January 3rd Palestinian journalist 
Kawther Salaam and Bob Holmes sat in the small two room house in the 
old city of Hebron, surrounded by 30 women, family and neighbours, as 
his mother and the three boys told the story. 
<p>
Heading home after playing, the boys heard shooting and decided it 
wasn't safe so went instead to the mosque for afternoon prayer which 
was just beginning. After prayer they were almost home when shooting 
started again. They felt safe in the narrow street with houses two 
stories high on the right and three stories high on the left. But an 
Israeli tank or rocket shell hit the top of the three story building 
and shrapnel filled the street wounding both Moath and Abdel. A man 
picked up Moath and ran with him, but blinded by the blood spurting 
from his head and mouth, tripped and fell. Others helped and both boys 
were taken to the hospital. Earlier, the boys showed Salaam and the 
CPT members the blood-soaked ground, now circled by rocks, a small 
martyr's shrine. 
<p>
Naji ran to tell Moath's mother huddled with her other children for 
safety . Moath's father was protecting his nieces and nephews nearby. 
Both parents went immediately to the hospital. Moath had died. Abdel, 
who is mute, had his head and arm wounds treated and was released. As 
he sat, his wounds shouted out the insanity of the situation. The aunt 
of the new "martyr" asked, " Who will defend our right to live in 
freedom without bombing and killing? It is not justice to live like 
refugees in our own land." 
<p>
Meanwhile, Rebecca Johnson accompanied Yusra, a neighbour, to 
the hospital to visit the child of a friend also wounded in the 
shelling attack on New Year's eve. Fourteen year old Abir Salema 
Kharami lay in bed with an IV hookup and bandages around her stomach 
and left hand. Abir had been on the steps of her home, about to head 
out to visit her two cousins in the hospital when the shrapnel sprayed 
her. Her grandmother held up her shirt and undershirt, full of holes 
and bloodstained. Upon leaving, Yusra reiterated the comments of 
others, "Everyone is against us, and what have we done? We just want 
to live in peace." 
<p>
These are not isolated tragedies. At 4:45 pm on January 5th, nineteen 
year old Ahlam Al Jabali went up to the rooftop of their four story 
building to help her husband's sister, eighteen year old Areeg Al 
Jabali take in the laundry. From the roof there is a clear line of 
sight to the Israeli settlement of Beit Haggai, but the family had 
never been fired on before. When the machine-gun bullets started to 
hit, the two women ran into the stairwell and hugged each other. The 
bullet entered Areeg's back and went through her body to lodge in 
Ahlam's abdomen. Trailing blood on every step they ran down to the 
second floor where the family was preparing supper. They fell through 
the door, where Areeg died. The bullet was removed from Ahlam in the 
hospital where Salaam heard and recorded her story. Ahlam died two 
days later. 

<p>Areeg's fiancé arrived from Haifa January 6th, bringing gold jewelry 
to finalize the marriage (an Arab custom). He attended her funeral 
instead.
