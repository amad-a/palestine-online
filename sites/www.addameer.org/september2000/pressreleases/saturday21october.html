  <b> 

ISRAELI MILITARY FORCES ESCALATE THEIR ATTACK ON THE CIVILIAN 
POPULATION IN
SPITE OF UN RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNING ISRAEL'S DISPROPORTIONATE USE OF 
FORCE</b>

<p>In spite of a growing number of developments on the international 
level,
including the passing of UN Security Council Resolution 1322 and the 19
October resolution of the UN Commission on Human Rights
(E/CN.4/S-5/L.2/Rev.1), condemning Israel's disproportionate use of 
force,
Israeli military forces have escalated their attack on the Palestinian
civilian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  In the period 
since
the conclusion of the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit on 17 October, 17 
Palestinians
have been killed, including 4 children.  Moreover, tens of Palestinians
have been wounded, among them, 18 year old, Sa'ed Al-Tambour from 
Nablus,
who was declared clinically dead yesterday after being shot in the head
with live ammunition.  Yesterday's casualties bring the total of
Palestinian children martyred since the outbreak of clashes to 31, with 
6
declared clinically dead.  All of these children died after sustaining
wounds to the upper part of the body.  According to a random sample of
injuries sustained by Palestinian children, and documented by DCI/PS,
approximately 50% of the injuries are located in the upper body, 
indicating
an Israeli policy to shoot to kill or seriously injure.  Such practices 
not
only contravene international standards, but also highlight the 
spurious
nature of official Israeli claims that soldiers open-fire only when 
their
lives are in imminent danger.   

<p>In addition to the increasing number of Palestinians killed or injured, 
the
Israeli occupation authorities have maintained the internal closure on
Palestinian areas at the same time as escalating their attacks against
Palestinian residential areas.  Yesterday, Israeli helicopter gunships
fired missiles into the West Bank cities of Nablus, Beit Sahour, and 
Beit
Jala, resulting in the forced evacuation of tens of Palestinian 
civilians
from their homes.  According to DCI/PS fieldwork, in Beit Sahour alone, 
at
least 6 Palestinians were injured in yesterday's attack, among them, 3
children, ranging in age from 5 to 9 years.  Among the children injured 
is
Palestinian girl-child, Fadia Issam Al-Huwash, who was admitted to
Al-Hussein Hospital after being struck in the neck with shrapnel.
Moreover, 15 houses sustained severe damage, including shattered 
windows
and partially destroyed walls, as a result of intense Israeli gunfire,
affecting at least 90 Palestinian civilians, including 30 children.  In
addition, approximately 100 other houses in the area sustained mild 
damage.
<p> Moreover, illegal Israeli settlers continue to attack Palestinian
residents and their property, terrorizing Palestinian civilians, and
inhibiting the carrying-out of daily activities, such as harvesting the
olive crop and moving freely from one area to the next.  Attacks are
particularly intense in rural villages and isolated areas. These 
attacks
continue to take place with the full knowledge, and frequently, under 
the
protection of the Israeli military.  

<p>In response to the 19 October resolution of the UN Commission on Human
Rights, the Israeli government publicly stated its refusal to cooperate
with the international commission of inquiry, called for in the 
resolution.
<p> DCI/PS views Israel's refusal to cooperate with the international
commission of inquiry not only as an attempt to cover-up its gross
violations of human rights, but also as yet another indicator of 
Israel's
blatant disrespect for UN resolutions designed to ensure implementation 
of
international human rights and humanitarian law.   

<p>In light of Israel's refusal to cooperate and the deteriorating human
rights situation, DCI/PS demands the following: 
<ol>
<li> That the UN:<br>
a. use all means at its disposal to ensure that Israel cooperates with 
the
international commission of inquiry, called for by the Special Session 
of
the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  In the case that Israel
continues its refusal to cooperate, DCI/PS demands that UN Member 
States
apply the same punitive measures against Israel that it would against 
any
other country that acts so blatantly in defiance of UN resolutions and
international law.<br>
b. That the UN immediately take concrete and effective action designed 
to
safeguard the lives of the Palestinian population, in particular 
children,
against the escalated Israeli assault on civilian persons and property.  <br>
c. That the UN initiate the necessary mechanisms for the establishment 
of
an International War Crimes Tribunal, in order that the individuals
responsible for the ongoing and gross violations of Palestinian human
rights be brought to justice.   
<li> That High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention 
Relative
to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War act immediately to
fulfill their article 1 duty to respect and ensure respect for the 
Convention.
<li> That the leaders of the Arab countries, currently meeting in Cairo,
utilize all means at their disposal to pressure Israel to cease all
violations of Palestinian human rights and immediately end the siege
against the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<h3>Al Haq</h3>
<b> 

Al-Haq Drafts Letter to Emergency Arab League Summit Urging Immediate 
Action
</b>
<p>



<p>Al-Haq drafted an open letter to the Secretary-General of the Arab 
league,
Ismat Abdul Majeid and to all of the Arab leaders participating in the
Emergency Arab Summit in Cairo on October 21 and 22. The letter was 
written
in Arabic and below are key excerpts translated into English.

<p>Since 1993 and the start of the Peace Process, Palestinians were 
optimistic
that there would be an end to the human rights violations and an end to 
the
violence and humiliation they had experienced but instead land
confiscation, settlement construction, house demolition and willful 
killing
continued. The latest move on the part of the Government of Israel, the
provocative visit of the Likud Party Chairman Ariel Sharon to the Haram
al-Sharif in Jerusalem, has led to 115 Palestinians killed by Israeli
Military forces and Settlers, 32 of which were children, and 5000
Palestinians injured.   

<p>The Israeli Military actions constitute grave breaches of the Fourth 
Geneva
Conventions. The excessive use of lethal and disproportionate force by 
the
Israeli Military against Palestinian protestors is a violation of
international humanitarian law and the principles of proportionality. 
The
large number of injuries to the head and chest indicates the deliberate
intention of the Israeli forces to inflict the highest number of 
casualties
and unnecessary suffering among civilians. The Israeli forces' 
excessive
force was used without distinction  bystanders, journalists and medical
personnel were deliberately targeted. The excessive use of 
disproportionate
force, using live ammunition, deploying snipers, using anti-tank 
missiles,
armored personnel carriers and assault helicopters to disperse 
Palestinian
demonstrators is unjustifiable and an aggravation of the situation
resulting in the escalation of violence. 

<p>The Sharm al Sheikh summit failed to address the legitimate rights of 
the
Palestinian people and portrayed the perpetrators and the victims as
equals. Al-Haq urges the Arab League to implement the following:
  <ol>
<li> Cut off all diplomatic, economic and trade relations with Israel and
impose economic sanctions against Israel in accordance with Chapter 6 
and 7
of the UN Charter. 
<li> Draft a special resolution at the Summit that ensures the protection 
of
the Palestinian People, to be submitted to the Security Council. 
<li> Call for the reconvening of the adjourned meeting of July 15, 1999 
of
all High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention. As High
Contracting Parties, the Arab League are obliged by Article 1 of the 
Fourth
Geneva Convention "to respect and ensure respect for the present 
Convention
in all circumstances." Furthermore Article 146 states that High 
Contracting
Parties are committed "to enact any legislation necessary to provide
effective penal sanctions for persons committing or ordering to be
committed any of the grave breaches of the Convention" and "… and shall
bring such persons regardless of their nationality before such courts." 
<li>Establish a special Arab Human Rights Unit in order to report
effectively to the United Nations and its member states.
