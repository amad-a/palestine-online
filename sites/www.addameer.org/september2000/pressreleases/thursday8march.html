<b>Israeli military authorities block Birzeit from the outside
      world </b>

<p>

       

          <p> March 7, 2001 (update: March 8, 2001) <br>
      On the eve of Sharon’s swearing in at the Knesset, the Israeli
      military authorities have been exercising harsh methods by
      blocking more roads in towns and cities in the West Bank, 
making
      it almost impossible for people to commute.At around midnight
      last night, the authorities went a step further, and dug up two
      trenches in between Ramallah and Birzeit, cutting it off
      completely from the outside world. In addition to the trenches,
      the authorities broke off water pipes and cut off the telephone
      lines, prohibiting any kind of communication between the
      residents. The two trenches are about 4 meters long, three
      meters wide, with a depth of 3 meters each. Beyond the two
      trenches, the bulldozer ruined another 100 meters of the road,
      by removing the asphalt, and digging up the road. The only way
      for people to reach Ramallah is to walk along the edges of the
      trenches, and take a car going in that direction. The trenches
      and the ruined road fall in Area B. 

      <p>The students and staff of Birzeit University are on a four-day
      holiday due to the Eid Al-Adha. The staff are supposed to come
      back to the University on Saturday, March 10, while the students
      are due back on the 17th of March when the second semester
      starts. 

      <p>If the trenches are not closed off before Saturday, the staff
      will not be able to reach the University. All the roads leading
      to the University from Al-Jalazon and northward have been closed
      for months, and the road dug up was the only link between the
      villages of Surda, Abu Kash, Birzeit, Jifna, Kobar and other
      villages with Ramallah. 

      <p>Birzeit University condemns this act perpetrated by the Israeli
      authorities, and considers it an act of inhumanity and cruelty,
      aiming at imprisoning thousands of people in their own homes and
      towns, while at the same time prohibiting the students of
      Birzeit University from reaching the University campus to pursue
      their education. 

<p>
      The Ramallah-Birzeit main road: two Israeli-dug trenches and
      destruction in between March 8, 2001: The road to Birzeit is
      still closed, and thousands of people are imprisoned in their
      own homes. Today, even worse than yesterday, four armored
      vehicles are patrolling the area where the trenches were dug,
      and people are forbidden to even cross on foot. So far, none of
      the residents of that area know what is going on, and why the
      Israeli authorities have gone to such extreme and inhumane
      measures.

<b> The Changing Role of Non-Governmental Organizations in 
Palestine, and
the Impact of the Ongoing Crisis on the Palestinian Nation-Building
Process </b>


<p>

 <ul><li> Since the 1960's, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) 
have
  played a key role in meeting the basic needs of the Palestinian
  community in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The absence of 
a
  government has left an enormous responsibility for NGO's to provide
  essential services in the fields of health, education, agriculture,
  psychological and physical rehabilitation, community services, and
  economic development. <li> The establishment of the Palestinian
  National Authority (PNA) in 1994 was a catalytic factor in the
  transformation of NGO's from primary 'providers' into complementary
  agencies to the central role of the Palestinian public sector. <li>
  NGO's continue to cater for 60% of primary health care services, 42%
  of hospitals, 90% of handicapped rehabilitation centers, and 95% of
  pre-school education. They serve the needs of more than one million
  people in the Palestinian agricultural sector, they have rescued
  25,000 dunums of Palestinian land from the threat of Israeli
  confiscation, and they employ over 25,000 Palestinian citizens. <li>
  With the outbreak of the Palestinian Uprising (Intifada) in late
  September 2000, the role of NGO's has shifted towards responding to
  the immediate and short-term needs of the Palestinian people across
  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. <li> In the health sector, NGO's
  are playing a central role in providing first aid services to the
  injured and absorbing them into emergency centers, providing
  essential medical supplies, and appealing to the donor community for
  financial support to meat the needs of their medical relief process.
  <li> NGO's are taking an equally important responsibility in
  providing mental health services and counseling for victims of the
  Intifada, an aspect which is essential to the various families
  (especially women and children) that are increasingly traumatized by
  the political, economic, and social hardships of the current crisis.
  <li> In addition, NGO's are having to provide emergency funds to
  maintain various community-based centers in refugee camps and
  isolated areas in the Palestinian territories. This is due to the
  fact that users of such centers are unable to provide the necessary
  funds in light of the economic hardships facing the majority of the
  Palestinian people. <li> Although the mentioned services of NGO's are
  indispensable and essential at this time of crisis, there is an
  urgent need to highlight an underlying crisis facing the general
  process of the NGO sector in Palestine, let alone the Palestinian
  nation-building process. <li> Since late September 2000, the majority
  of NGO's in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have had to increase
  their spending to meet the immediate needs of the Palestinian people
  in light of the ongoing crisis. Major NGO's have been drawn to
  disburse significant amounts of their annual budget to swiftly meet
  short-term demands, raising serious doubt as to whether they will be
  able to sustain their regular programs in the near future. <li>
  Without the availability of regular and systematic funding, it is
  unlikely that NGO's in Palestine will be able to carry out their
  mainstream duties, the consequences of which will have detrimental
  economic, political, and social effects on the Palestinian people.
  Thus, within the context of the current circumstances, the changing
  role of NGO's into relief and short-term providers will leave
  serious and long-term problems. <li> Even an overall improvement in
  the political situation will leave the majority of NGO's with
  significantly fewer resources than required to maintain the
  Palestinian development process. <li> The effect of this problem on
  Palestinian civil society is equally disturbing, since a significant
  number of NGO's is directly conducive to the political structure of
  Palestinian society. Various NGO's are leading the Palestinian quest
  to promote pluralism, rule of law, democracy and human rights in the
  Palestinian territories. Therefore, a shortfall in the capacity of
  such institutions will have direct and detrimental effects on the
  general process of Palestinian political development and the
  fostering of civil society. <li> This problem reinforces the need for
  Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
  and to pave the way for the Palestinian nation-building process to
  continue undisturbed, in order to ensure peace and security for both
  sides of the conflict. <li> Equally, there is an urgent need for the
  international community to realize the importance of sustaining the
  NGO sector in Palestine, and to take concrete and immediate steps to
  ensure the continuity of this indispensable aspect of the
  Palestinian nation-building process.</ul>
