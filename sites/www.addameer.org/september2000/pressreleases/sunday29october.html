<p>The Zionist occupation Authorities swept away (162) dunums,
which are
basically agricultural lands owned by the citizens of Gaza Strip as
follows:
<ul>
<li>(45) dunums in Beit-Lahia area that is planted with citrus fruits,
Jawava & olives.

<li> (32) dunums located in the Al-Shuhadah
crossroads
near Netsarim settlement. This land is planted with citrus fruits &
olives, in addition to demolishing water well used for irrigation &
drinking.

<li> (40) dunums in Alqararah area, near Kfar Daroum
settlement, which was planted with olives, palm trees & citrus
fruits..

<li> (45) dunums  located in the area between Alqararah &
Deir
Al-Balah, planted with olives, palm trees & citrus fruits. The
Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture stated that Israeli occupation
army destroyed (2000) trees. The estimated cost is $(200,000).
Moreover, the amount of damaged equipment & buildings is approx.
$(150,000). In addition to destroying grafts that costed an amount of
$(100,000). The Zionist Occupation Government is aiming at controlling
the lands of the Palestinian peasants & farmers besides destroying the
production infrastructure, so that the Palestinians will emigrate from
their country seeking jobs & livelihood.
</ul>
<p>The Democracy and Workers' Rights Center is calling upon the
supporters of human rights, justice, peace, democracy & environment to
pressure on the occupation government & its ambassadors in your
countries to stop the atrocities committed against the unarmed
Palestinian nation.

CLOSURE UPDATE NO. 25
29 October 2000
Report by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights 
on the Closure Imposed by Israel
on the Gaza Strip

<p>This is the 25th in a series of updates published by the Palestinian 
Centre for Human Rights on the closure imposed by Israel on the Gaza 
Strip.  This update documents the effects of the ongoing total siege that 
has been imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip since September 29, 2000.  
The Israeli occupying forces have also continued to isolate Jerusalem 
from the entire occupied Palestinian territories, denying the access of 
Palestinians to the city's holy sites.  In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli 
occupation forces extended the siege to include single cities and 
villages.  On October 26, the Israeli occupation forces separated the 
southern part of the Gaza Strip from its northern part.  Consequently, 
residents of the south (Khan Yunis and Rafah governates) were unable to 
return home from Gaza City.  This action affected employees, students, 
families of the wounded and even the handicapped who receive services in 
Gaza City.  The continued siege has negatively affected all aspects of 
life in the occupied Palestinian territories for the fourth consecutive 
week.
 
<p>1.	Further Deterioration of the Economic Situation in the Gaza Strip:

<p>Daily large losses in the Palestinian economy have consistently 
increased under the siege that has been imposed on the occupied Palestinian 
territories since September 29, 2000.  This has resulted in further 
deterioration of the Palestinian economy on all levels – commercial, 
industrial, agricultural, etc.

<p>a)	Continued Prevention of the Gaza Strip's Commercial Transactions:

<p>Contrary to the claims of the Israeli occupation authorities in regard 
to completely opening border crossings, especially the Karni Outlet, 
PCHR staff members entitled to observe the movement of goods at border 
crossings reported that Israel continued to hinder the import and export 
of all kinds of goods as it did during the first days of the siege.  
Israel also restricted the movement of local products between the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank.  In this regard, an official Palestinian source 
at Karni Outlet stated that these abusive and unjustified measures 
caused large daily losses for traders.  Only 50 percent of the trucks that 
were allowed to pass through the outlet before the siege was imposed 
are allowed to do so now.  The allowed goods are limited to meat, dairy 
products, fruits and furniture.  The Israeli occupation forces also 
prevent the entry of construction raw materials into the Gaza Strip.

<p>The administration of the Israeli harbor, Ashdod, continued to block 
more than 2,800 containers of different goods imported by Palestinian 
traders.  Gazan traders imported 850 of these containers.  The harbor 
administration also blocked three ships loaded with construction raw 
materials and 900 cars imported by Gazan traders.  The other commercial 
border crossing, Sofa Outlet, is still closed for trucks used to transport 
construction raw material.

<p>b)	Continued Deterioration of the Industrial Sector:

<p>The industrial sector faces enormous problems under the total siege on 
the Gaza Strip.  This sector imports 90 percent of raw materials from 
other countries and Israel denies its clearance from Israeli harbors.  
As a result, the productivity of the industrial sector has decreased.  
For example, foodstuffs have been reduced by 80 percent, industrial 
construction by 90 percent, chemical and plastic industry decreased by 75 
percent, textile industry by 100 percent, professional industry by 85 
percent, etc.  Some industries have completely been halted.  In addition, 
blocking raw material in Israeli harbors necessitates paying additional 
amounts of money for each day of delay, thereby increasing the cost of 
imports.

<p>c)	Continued Deterioration of the Agricultural  Sector:

<p>The agricultural suffers great damage under the total Israeli siege on 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for several reasons including:<br>
·	The siege coincided with the season for cultivating olives, guava and 
strawberries.<br>
·	Many tracts of agricultural land are adjacent to Israeli military 
posts.<br>
·	The increased number of donums planted with plants like guava, 
cucumber, potatoes and tomatoes to meet the need of the market.<br>
·	Sweeping and destroying hundreds of donums of agricultural land and 
uprooting thousands of fruit-bearing trees by the Israeli occupation 
forces.

<p>The Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture has estimated the loss of the 
agricultural sector in a report PCHR received at about $3.7 million 
daily.  This means that the total loss has been more than $100 million 
since imposing the current siege.  This does not even include the loss 
caused by destroying and damaging property and the imposition of taxes on 
Palestinian importers for imported goods blocked in Israeli harbors.

<p>In the Gaza Strip, there are 17,000 hothouses.  Planting each of these 
hothouses cost JD 1,500 this season and because of the current 
situation farmers cannot recover these costs.

<p>d)	Continued Denial of Laborers' Access to Their Work Places:

<p>The Israeli occupation authorities continue to deny the access of about 
100,000 Palestinian laborers from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to 
their work places.  More than 80 percent of the laborers who work inside 
the occupied Palestinian territories have been also negatively 
affected.  The Palestinian Ministry of Labor has estimated the daily loss of 
labor at $6,500,000 (this number covers the loss of labor in Israel and 
inside the occupied Palestinian territories).  The total loss since 
imposing the current siege has been $187,500,000, in addition to tax and 
health insurance collected from laborers by the Palestinian National 
Authority which is $5 million monthly.

<p>The following table illustrates the losses that have affected the 
Palestinian economy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank during the 30 days 
of closure and is based on reports published by the Palestinian 
Ministries of Economy and Labor:


<p>Sector&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Loss in millions	<br>
Labor&nbsp;&nbsp;	187.5		<br>
Agriculture&nbsp;&nbsp;	103		<br>
Transportation	&nbsp;&nbsp;5		<br>
Industry&nbsp;&nbsp;	60		<br>
Tourism	&nbsp;&nbsp;30		<br>
Trade&nbsp;&nbsp;	30		<br>
Imports	&nbsp;&nbsp;75		<br>
Total&nbsp;&nbsp;	490.5		<br>


<p>2.	Further Deterioration of Health in the Gaza Strip:

<p>The policy of the Israeli occupation authorities in imposing 
restrictions on the entry of medicines into the Gaza Strip has not changed.  
Dozens of patients are deprived of their right to get treatment outside the 
Gaza Strip.

<p>Palestinian Minister of Health Dr. Riadh El-Za'noun stated that several 
planes loaded with medicines, medical equipment and ambulances from 
Qatar and Saudi Arabia landed at Al-A'rish airport in Egypt because the 
Israeli occupation authorities denied their access to Gaza International 
Airport.  The cargo was unloaded into stores near Al-A'rish airport. 
El-Za'noun added that two Saudi planes dedicated to transfer a number of 
the wounded in clashes with the Israeli occupation forces from 
hospitals in Gaza to hospitals in Saudi Arabia were forced to land at Al-A'rish 
airport as Gaza International Airport was closed by the Israeli 
occupation authorities.

<p>An official source of the Palestinian Ministry of Health stated that 
some Israeli hospitals dealt inhumanely with some Palestinian casualties 
transferred to those hospitals.  In this context, a Gazan woman 
appealed to the Palestinian Minister of Health through local newspapers not to 
send any of the wounded to Israeli hospitals.  She asserted that she 
received maltreatment when she accompanied her paralyzed nephew, Nasser 
Al-Rizi.  

<p>On October 21, 2000, the Israeli occupation forces blocked an ambulance 
of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society that was transporting Mohammed 
Nasser Abu Zeid, seriously wounded in the chest, at Al-Krama border 
crossing (King Hussein Bridge) into Jordan.  The Israeli occupying forces 
claimed that he was wanted. 

<p>On October 25, 2000, the Israeli occupation forces prevented seven 
cancer patients from the Gaza Strip from traveling to Asota hospital in 
Israel for treatment.  PCHR learned that these patients were receiving 
chemical treatment in the mentioned hospital twice a week.

<p>On October 27, the child Dheeb Ibrahim Al-Najjar, wounded by a 
rubber-coated metal bullet in the head, was transferred from Shifa' hospital in 
Gaza into a hospital in Jordan.  The Israeli occupation forces allowed 
the travel of the child, but denied the travel of his father although 
the child is 13 years old and necessarily in need of an adult companion.

<p>3.	Continued Prevention of Visiting Prisoners:

<p>Despite the agreements signed between the Palestinians and the Israelis 
on the release of Palestinian prisoners, the Israeli occupation forces 
continue to detain thousands of Palestinian prisoners in their jails.  
These authorities have prevented families of these prisoners from 
visiting them in Israeli jails.

<p>4.	A Shortage of Foodstuffs:

<p>The Gaza Strip suffers a shortage of foodstuffs under the siege that 
has been imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities for the fourth 
consecutive week.  Many basic goods, such as lentils, beans and some other 
legumes, have been lacking in commercial stores.  The continued siege 
has also caused a relative shortage of wheat used in making flour.  The 
Israeli occupation forces continue to prevent the entry of alimentary 
assistance.  It is worth mentioning that dozens of trucks loaded with 
foodstuffs have been stopped at the Palestinian-Egyptian border and are 
awaiting permission for their entry into the Gaza Strip.  In this 
context, the Palestinian Minister of Supplies warned of possible damage to 
these foodstuffs and held the Israeli occupation authorities responsible 
for this.

<p>5.	Continued Blockage of Visits to Holy Sites:

<p>More than one million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been deprived 
from exercising their right of worship, especially Muslims who could 
not visit Jerusalem on October 24, 2000, on the anniversary of Prophet 
Mohammed's ascension to the seven heavens.  More than 3,000 Christians 
have also been deprived from visiting the Christian holy sites in 
Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

<p>6.	Complete Cessation of Construction Sector:

<p>Since imposing the current siege on the Gaza Strip no material entered 
the Gaza Strip either through Israel or through Rafah border crossing 
on the Palestinian-Egyptian borders.  The Israeli occupation forces have 
continued to block cement cargo of three ships in the Israeli Ashdod 
harbor.  This has resulted in the complete cessation of the construction 
of houses, mosques, institutions and other facilities.

<p>7.	Restrictions on Free Movement:

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have continued to deny the right of 
Palestinian citizens to free movement throughout the areas under the control 
of the Palestinian National Authority.  They have prevented movement 
between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  They have also continued to 
exercise provocative actions against Palestinian citizens in the Gaza 
Strip.  They have positioned roadblocks between the cities of the Gaza 
Strip and have continued to check cars and citizens.  They have 
confiscated some cars and firearms of members of Palestinian security services.  
The Israeli occupation forces have reinforced their presence on the 
main road between the north of the Gaza Strip and its south (Salah El-Din 
Street) at the following points:
<ol>
<li>	The entrance of a branch road leading to Morag settlement in the 
east and the entrance of a road leading to Gush Qatif settlement block 
(Rafah).
<li>	Gush Qatif junction and the entrance to Kissufim (Khan Yunis).
<li>	Near Kfar Darom settlement (the middle area of the Gaza Strip).
</ol>
<p>Under such measures, on October 26, 2000, the Israeli occupation forces 
separated the north of the Gaza Strip from its south.  Citizens have 
not been able to move freely inside the Gaza Strip.  In this context, the 
staff of Atfalona (Our Children) Society for the Deaf stated that the 
Israeli occupation forces denied some deaf children who receive the 
services of the society from returning to their homes despite the 
intervention of some international organizations.  The Society was forced to 
transport these children to their relatives in Gaza City after 
consultation with their families.

<p>Conclusion:

<p>The Israeli occupation authorities have imposed a total siege on the 
occupied Palestinian territories.  The Palestinian people have 
increasingly suffered from the deterioration of living conditions.  In the Gaza 
Strip, citizens face an unknown future.  They are frustrated by the 
brutal actions, collective punishment and starving carried out by the 
Israeli occupation authorities on a premeditated basis.  

<p>PCHR warns of an economic, social, political and humanitarian disaster 
in the occupied Palestinian territories in light of the current total 
siege.  PCHR believes that the policies adopted by the Israeli 
occupation authorities against the Palestinian people contradict all human 
rights conventions.  PCHR calls upon the international human rights 
community to immediately intervene to lift this oppressive siege.
