Illegal and Morally Reprehensible

<b>The Israeli Shelling: 
Illegal and Morally Reprehensible</b>

<p>Since the eruption of the Palestinian Intifada Israeli forces have 
shelled many civilian Palestinian areas on a nightly basis killing 
and injuring numerous Palestinians and destroying their property. 
Indiscriminately fired Israeli shells make no distinction between 
civilian homes and facilities and legitimate military targets. Over 
the last five months al-Haq has been carefully following and 
documenting these developments. After intensive bombing 
campaigns during the first few months of the Intifada, Israeli 
forces, under intense international pressure, began to limit their 
use of tanks and helicopters in strikes against Palestinian targets 
during January. Unfortunately this reprieve proved to be only 
temporary. During the last several weeks, Israeli missiles have 
once again begun to rain down on Palestinian civilian areas. What 
follows is a case study of one of these attacks based on 
information gathered by al-Haq’s fieldworkers.<p>
The National School for Blind Girls in al-Bireh came under fire 
from Israeli tanks and heavy weaponry on 20 February 2001. 
The school was shelled for more than three hours causing 
extensive damage to the building. However, of greater 
significance is the psychological impact that the shelling had on 
the disabled children in the school. "The crime is doubled when it 
is committed against disabled children who can hear the sound of 
the explosions, but can not see what is happening around them. 
We do not know what to do now in order to protect the children " 
said the school’s headmaster Mr. Hayyan al-Idrisi. <p>
The National School for Blind Girls was established in 1978 under 
the initiative of the Friends of the Blind Association in Palestine 
with the objective of providing an education for children whose 
parents cannot afford the expense of educating their disabled 
child. The school works hard to integrate the students into the 
wider Palestinian society in an attempt to provide them with every 
opportunity given to student without disabilities. It currently serves 
75 blind female students ages 4-18 and is primarily dependent 
upon charitable donations given by local community members. 
The school provides educational, artistic, and counseling services 
for its students. It doubles as a home for many of the students 
who board there. Teachers treat students with motherly affection 
and the students feel safe while they are at the school.Both 
students and their teachers believed that the school was a safe 
location in which the students could receive a good education. 
Unfortunately, the Israeli shelling changed this belief causing 
many students and staff to feel worried and on edge. <p>
Ten-year-old Isra’ Ziedan told of the shelling as follows, "I was 
awakened by the sounds of shelling. I began crying and woke up 
the rest of the children to escape. None of the children could 
move out of fear. Our teacher came and asked us to move to the 
staircase, as it is the safest place in the building. All of the 
students rushed to the staircase and, as they cannot see, many fell 
down out of panic and fear. After I left my room I started looking 
for my brother who attends the school with me, but I could not 
find him. Our teacher then asked us to pray for the shelling to stop 
and to ask God to protect us. Ulfat, who is only 4, would not stop 
crying until our teacher Suhier came and hugged her" Ulfat said 
that at first she tried to calm down other children, but being only a 
child herself she was also scared of the shelling and needed 
someone to comfort her. After a short time she said that she 
could not contain her fear and began to cry. Her teacher said that 
she cried throughout the rest of the Shelling, which lasted for 
three hours.<p>
The Israeli authorities often talk about "purity of arms", but then 
defile this “purity” when they use force indiscriminately against 
civilian targets, including innocent disabled children. In so doing 
the Israeli forces have violated international treaties and norms 
related to the rights of children, and all commonly held ethical 
standards. <p>
For years al-Haq has repeatedly warned the international 
community about the consequences of Israel’s continuous 
violations of International Humanitarian Law and Palestinian 
civilians’ human rights. We would now like to express deep 
concern regarding these most recent developments and Israel’s 
continued grave violations in the Occupied Territories. Local and 
international human rights organizations have repeatedly called 
upon the United Nations Security Council to provide a protection 
force for the Palestinian people. Unfortunately their requests 
have fallen upon deaf ears and no action has been taken. In order 
to stop the Israeli authorities from continuing their illegal 
campaign, which has instilled terror in the local Palestinian 
population, al-Haq now calls upon the international community to 
place pressure upon the members of the Security Council to take 
immediate action. To wait can only serve to further Israel’s goal 
of terrorizing the Palestinian people and will lead to an increased 
number of human rights violations. The Palestinian people both 
deserve and require the assistance and protection of the 
international community
