<H2>Palestinian Center for Human Rights</H2>
<B>Statement under oath by a photographer of the French TV, France 2</B> <br>
<B> The killing of the child Mohammed Al-Durreh by the Israeli Occupying Forces 
was intentional and happened in cold blood</B> 
<p>The live film by the photographer of the French TV France 2, Talal Abu Rahma, 
  which showed the shooting of the child Mohammed Jamal Al-Durreh, 12 years old 
  from Al-Boreij, and his father by the Israeli Occupying Forces, which resulted 
  in his death and injuring his father severely, is one of the most prominent 
  evidences of the grave and blatant human rights violations of the Israeli Occupying 
  Forces against Palestinian civilians. The child and his father sheltered behind 
  a concrete block of about 70cm high set against a wall. Despite the fact that 
  the child and his father were crying for help, the Israeli Occupying Forces 
  continued to shoot at them and ultimately killed the child with no mercy. 
<p>This incident constitutes another crime added to the list of crimes and violations 
  of international humanitarian law committed by the Israeli Occupying Forces. 
  The dramatic scene was broadcast all around the world and certainly watched 
  by millions of people. The Israeli government had therefore no choice but to 
  investigate the incident. As expected, the outcome of the investigation recalls 
  past investigations of crimes committed by the Israeli Occupying Forces; the 
  victim bears responsibility even if it was indirect. The Israeli government 
  does not establish that the Israeli Occupying Forces are responsible for the 
  crime, and therefore did not undertake any legal action against the perpetrator 
  (s) of the crime. 
<p>The following is a statement under oath by Mr. Talal Abu Rahma, a photographer 
  of the French TV France 2, to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights on October 
  3, 2000, giving details of what he had seen: 
<p>"I, the undersigned, Talal Hassan Abu Rahma, resident of the Gaza Strip and 
  who bears ID no. 959852849, give my statement under oath and after having been 
  given legal warning and choice by Lawyer Raji Sourani, on the killing of Mohammed 
  Jamal Al-Durreh and the injuring of his father Jamal Al-Durreh both shot at 
  by the Israeli Occupying Forces. 
<p>"I work as a correspondent for the French TV France 2. On September 30, 2000, 
  as part of my duties, I was at Netzarim area from 7:00a.m reporting on the clashes. 
  At noon, when I was about to finish work and go back to the broadcasting studio, 
  I heard intensive shooting from all directions. At that moment, I was at the 
  northern part of the road leading to Al-Shohada' Junction (Netzarim Junction). 
  I was in a position which enabled me to see and observe the Israeli military 
  outpost at the northwest of the junction, and the two Palestinian apartment 
  buildings located to the north of the junction. I could also see the outpost 
  of the Palestinian National Security Forces, located south of the junction, 
  and another Palestinian outpost 30m away, which was a temporary booth where 
  members of Palestinian forces were resting. 
<p>"Suddenly, intensive shooting started across the road which is of 30m width. 
  Shams Oudeh, Reuters photographer caught my attention, as he was sitting besides 
  a man and a child (Jamal and his son Mohammed). They were all sheltering behind 
  a concrete block. What the journalist was observing attracted my attention. 
  I was trying to focus on the outpost of the Palestinian National Security Forces, 
  from where shooting was directed, and at which the Israeli army was shooting, 
  during the first minutes. Suddenly, I heard a cry of a child. Then, I focused 
  my camera on the child Mohammed Jamal Al-Durreh who was shot in his right leg. 
  His father tried to calm, protect and cover his son with his hands and body. 
  Sometimes, the father Jamal was raising his hands asking for help. Other details 
  of the incident are as they were apparently shown at the film. I spent approximately 
  27 minutes photographing the incident which took place for 45 minutes. After 
  the father and the child were evacuated by an ambulance to the hospital, I stayed 
  30-40 minutes. I could not leave the area, because all of those who were in 
  the area, including me, were being shot at and endangered. 
<p>"Shooting started first from different sources, Israeli and Palestinian. It 
  lasted for not more than 5 minutes. Then, it was quite clear for me that shooting 
  was towards the child Mohammed and his father from the opposite direction to 
  them. Intensive and intermittent shooting was directed at the two and the two 
  outposts of the Palestinian National Security Forces. The Palestinian outposts 
  were not a source of shooting, as shooting from inside these outposts had stopped 
  after the first five minutes, and the child and his father were not injured 
  then. Injuring and killing took place during the following 45 minutes. 
<p>"I can assert that shooting at the child Mohammed and his father Jamal came 
  from the above - mentioned Israeli military outpost, as it was the only place 
  from which shooting at the child and his father was possible. So, by logic and 
  nature, my long experience in covering hot incidents and violent clashes, and 
  my ability to distinguish sounds of shooting, I can confirm that the child was 
  intentionally and in cold blood shot dead and his father injured by the Israeli 
  army. 
<p>"On the following day of the incident, I went to Shifa Hospital in Gaza, and 
  interviewed the father of child Mohammed Al-Durreh. The interview was videotaped 
  and broadcast. In the interview, I asked him about his reason and circumstances 
  of being at the place of the incident. I was the first journalist to interview 
  him on this subject. Mr. Jamal Al-Durreh said that he was going accompanied 
  by his son Mohammed to the car market, which is about 2km away to the north 
  of Al-Shohada' Junction, to buy a car. He told me that he failed to buy a car, 
  so decided to go home. He and his son took a taxi. When they got close to the 
  junction, they could not move forward because of the clashes and shooting there. 
  So, they got out of the taxi and tried to walk towards Al-Bureij. As shooting 
  intensified, they sheltered behind a concrete block. Then the incident occurred. 
  Shooting lasted for 45 minutes. 
<p>"I am a professional and specialized journalist. I have worked in this field 
  for many years. I am committed to the principles of journalistic work, and to 
  convey reality indiscriminately, objectively and neutrally. This is why I am 
  a distinguished journalist. I have my own press office, and I work as a correspondent 
  for the French TV France 2. I work also for CNN through Al-Wataneya Press Office. 
<p>"I have hereby given my testimony under oath and after being legally warned 
  and granted the choice. I swear that all the above * mentioned statement is 
  right and consistent with reality and law."

<p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"><b>URGENT PETITION! WE DEMAND INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION 
  FOR PALESTINIANS!</b> </font></p>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> 
<p>Israel's recent unleashing of military forces, including tanks and helicopter 
  gunships, against unarmed or lightly armed Palestinian civilians has underscored 
  the Palestinians' urgent need for international protection. 
<p>Evidence from various hospitals indicates that Israeli forces have been using 
  lethal ammunition since the first day of the conflict, and are targeting civilians' 
  heads and chests. Clearly, this implies that soldiers have been given "shoot 
  to kill" orders, a contravention of the Fourth 
<p>Geneva Convention. 
<p>Unlike all other refugee groups in the world today, Palestinians--the world's 
  largest and oldest refugee population--are not accorded legal protection under 
  existing international conventions, nor by the United Nations High Commissioner 
  for Refugees (UNHCR). Furthermore, Israel has consistently refused to recognize 
  its obligations under the Geneva Conventions, particularly those clauses that 
  protect civilians under military occupation. 
<p>To date (6 October) nearly 70 Palestinians have been killed, half of them children 
  under the age of 15, while more than 1000 have been wounded, many suffering 
  serious and incapacitating injuries, such as loss of eyes, limbs and grave damage 
  to internal organs. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Barak threatens further 
  violence if the Palestinian Authority does not resume the "peace process." If 
  demonstrations continue, we must expect Palestinian casualties to continue on 
  the same scale as the first week, or perhaps to increase. 
<p>Even if demonstrations subside, it is certain that intransigent Israeli policies 
  will lead to more confrontation, and more slaughter, in the weeks and months 
  to come. 
<p>This dangerous and violent situation continues because U.S. diplomatic, economic, 
  and military backing allows Israel to behave like a "rogue state" without suffering 
  the penalties other states so termed have been subjected to. Permitting Israel 
  to continue to kill and maim civilians without being submitted to a UN commission 
  of inquiry makes a mockery of international law and undermines UN resolutions. 
<p>We, the undersigned associations and individuals, submit this petition to the 
  UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, requesting that he dispatch, without delay, 
  UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson to Jerusalem, Gaza, the West Bank, 
  and Arab communities in Israel to write a report on the recent events. 
<p>We call on the UN Human Rights Commission to extend the same levels and types 
  of protection to Palestinians as is extended to other refugees. 
<p>Failing this, we call for the formation of a special subcommittee within the 
  UN Commission for Economic and Social Rights to maintain a permanent monitoring 
  function in relation to abuses of the inalienable rights of Palestinians. Palestinian 
  refugees' rights must be considered no different than the rights and needs of 
  any other refugee group under the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Furthermore, 
  the rights and needs of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, who remain stateless 
  seven years after the inception of the Oslo Accords, must also receive special 
  consideration.

  Second Follow-up to Case ISR 021000 
<p> <b>The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention 
  in the following situation in Israel.</b> 
<p>New Information 
<p>The International Secretariat of OMCT has received the following reports over 
  the last few days from the Palestinian Society for the Protection for Human 
  Rights and the Environment (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, detailing the 
  deaths of and injuries caused to Palestinians, including children, by Israeli 
  forces using live ammunition. 
<p>The International Secretariat of OMCT repeats its grave concern over these 
  killings and injuries and call on the Israeli authorities to put an immediate 
  end to this use of excessive force against Palestinian demonstrators. 
<p>On October 3 2000, in Gaza, Fahmi Abu Amune, 28, from Al-Nusairat Refugee Camp 
  died from missile fire. Omar Abdlerahim Sulieman, 20, from Jabalyia Refugee 
  Camp died from a gunshot to the head. A third unidentified civilian died after 
  being shot in the face. Ismail Shehdeh Ismail died from a gunshot wound to the 
  head and Sharif Abdullah Ashour was pronounced clinically dead. 
<p>According to the information, in Hebron, Muhammad Younis Mahmoud Ayaish Al- 
  Zama'reh, 21 from Halhoul, died of injuries sustained on Friday. 60 people were 
  injured. In Jenin, Khadra Ahmad Hussein Salameh, 57, from Jenin, died from complications 
  of tear gas inhalation. 
<p>In Israel, Ramez Abbas Bushnaq from Kufur Manda were reported dead. 
<p>As a result of the shooting, 20 people were reported injured in Nablus. 
<p>LAW's field worker in Nablus has reported that the Israeli Forces raided a 
  home near Josephs Tomb. 7 were injured as a result. In Tulkarem 17 were reported 
  injured, including. Bader Yousef Deeb Ahmad, who was seriously injured in his 
  hand and stomach. 
<p>Another three persons were identified the next day as having been killed: Mohannad 
  Fares, 24, from Deir Al Ghusoun in the district of Toulkarem and a member of 
  the Palestinian national forces, died from gunshot wounds in his liver, lungs 
  and abdomen. Ayman Aloh, 20, from Hai Adurj, was shot in the chest and died 
  instantly. Inside the green line, Mohammad Khamaiseh, from Kufur Kana, died 
  from injuries sustained the previous day. 
<p>Another 15 people were reported injured in Ramallah and another 50 in Bethlehem. 
<p>Reports of October 4 2000 noted the deaths of four persons: Muhammed Fauzi 
  Al Sarkhi, 22, from al Sawahre Jerusalem, Mamoud Ibrahim Emwasi, 23, from Betuina, 
  Ramallah, both shot when Israeli Military Forces attacked them at dawn in Betunia, 
  and Ala Hassan Jabber Al- Barghuthi, 24 from Abud, Ramallah, shot in the chest 
  by soldiers in Beit El near the City Inn. In Gaza, 12-year-old Muhhamed Yousef 
  Abu Asi from Beni Suhaila, was shot in the chest by a bullet fired at him at 
  the Shuhada Triangle, near the Netzarim Settlement. 
<p>Israeli Helicopters continued firing at civilians with 500 mm machine guns 
  and Israeli Occupation Forces bombed an iron factory with rockets fired from 
  the air and land. In a disturbing development, settlers from the Netzarim settlement 
  fired at civilians as well, with out the intervention of the Israeli Occupation 
  Forces. 
<p>According to information collected by LAW¹s field researchers in Bethlehem, 
  Nablus and Ramallah; Israeli snipers are using silencers when shooting at Palestinians. 
  Direct hits are only noticed after ambulances arrive to collect the dead and 
  injured. It was also reported that the Occupation Forces left the City Inn in 
  Ramallah, only to situate themselves at Occupation Headquarters nearby. They 
  are reported to have installed new fortified protective barriers from which 
  they fire at Palestinian civilians. 
<p>The total injured on 4 October 200 was noted as 117 persons, making a grand 
  total of 2657 persons. 
<p>October 5 2000: LAW reported the death of three more Palestinians making a 
  total of 64 to this date: Mustafa Al Fararja, 22, from the Dheisheh Refugee 
  Camp in Bethlehem, Mahmoud Istayeh, 26, from Gaza, and Arafat Al Atrash, 18, 
  from the city of Hebron. Al Fararja, a member of the Palestinian National Forces, 
  was shot in the chest by an Israeli sniper as he was standing in the vicinity 
  of the Beit Jala Tunnel. His colleague, Akram Sha'fout, was also hit with a 
  bullet in the chest in the same location. 
<p>A Palestinian who had sustained serious injuries died yesterday. Salameh Zeyadat, 
  20, from the Aqabet Jaber Refugee Camp in Jericho, was injured on 2 October 
  2000. 
<p>Actions requested 
<p>Please continue to write to the authorities in Israel urging them to: 
<ol>
  <li> put an immediate end to the use of excessive force and the use of live 
    ammunition against demonstrators in accordance with international human rights 
    standards, in particular Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the United Nations Basic 
    Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; 
  <li> ensure that all law enforcement agencies conform to international human

<h3>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section</h3>
<b>THE EXECUTION OF 17 YEAR OLD, 'ASEEL 'ASSALIH:<br>
A Murder in Cold Blood </b> 
<p>DCI/PS views with grave concern the brutal slaying of 17 year old, Aseel Hassan 
  'Assalih, from the town of 'Arrabeh in the Upper Galilee. On 3 October 2000, 
  Aseel died after having been severely beaten and shot in the neck by the Israeli 
  military. 'Aseel is one of 18 Palestinian children killed and hundreds injured 
  by Israeli military forces since the outbreak of confrontations on 28 September 
  2000. 
<p>According to a statement given to DCI/PS by his older sister, Nardine, 'Aseel 
  was attending a demonstration in 'Arrabeh on 3 October with friends. His parents, 
  who were viewing the demonstration from a nearby hill, attest that 'Aseel was 
  neither throwing stones nor holding any signs during the protest, but, rather, 
  he was chanting slogans with his friends. At some point, during the demonstration, 
  Israeli soldiers advanced their position and Palestinian protestors dispersed 
  in all directions. 'Aseel ran into a nearby olive grove for protection, but 
  Israeli soldiers followed him, caught him and began to severely beat him. After 
  subjecting him to two separate beatings, he was shot with one bullet, at close 
  range, in the neck. The soldiers then left the area and alerted by-standers 
  to his location. 
<p>When the group reached him, he was bleeding seriously. The group called an 
  ambulance, however, given restrictions set by Israeli police and soldiers, the 
  ambulance was unable to get through quickly, so 'Aseel was placed in a private 
  car and transported to Al-Hayaat Medical Center in 'Arrabeh to receive emergency 
  first aid. There, medical center staff gave 'Aseel CPR and stabilized him. He 
  was then transported via ambulance to a nearby hospital, but, once again, Israeli 
  military presence in the area made it impossible to transport him quickly. The 
  ambulance was not allowed through quickly and was forced to stop at numerous 
  checkpoints established along the way. Once at the hospital, he was immediately 
  taken to surgery, but after approximately 10 minutes, the surgeon ended the 
  procedure as there was no possibility of reviving the child. The hospital reports 
  indicate that marks of serious beating were evident all over 'Aseel's body. 
<p>According to Nardine 'Assalih, 'Aseel was a bright, gregarious boy, and extremely 
  active in the Seeds of Peace program, which attempts to bring Israeli and Arab 
  youth together. 'Aseel had participated in the group for several years, traveling 
  with them to both the United States and Switzerland. At the time of his brutal 
  killing, 'Aseel was wearing a Seeds of Peace tee-shirt. 
<p>According to his sister, 'Aseel was a strong believer in non-violent struggle 
  and the possibility of peaceful co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians, 
  at the same time as allowing both peoples to express their own national identity. 
  'Aseel's violent death at the hands of Israeli soldiers and police has caused 
  many members of the community to re-examine the ideals that 'Aseel held so high 
  and to question what is the role of Palestinians living inside Israel? If the 
  life of a Palestinian child and citizen of Israel can so easily be destroyed 
  by Israeli forces, how ready and willing is Israeli society for peaceful co-existence? 
<p>DCI/PS condemns the brutal killing of 'Aseel 'Assalih and calls for the following: 
<ul>
  <li>That an investigation into the circumstances surrounding 'Aseel's murder 
    is immediately launched and that the persons responsible, both the individual 
    actors and their commanding officers, be brought to justice. 
  <li>That the Israeli military immediately cease its brutal assault on Palestinian 
    civilians and uphold its commitments under international law, in particular, 
    the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Fourth 
    Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
    War. 
  <li>That the international community immediately utilize all powers at their 
    disposal to force Israel to abide by international humanitarian and human 
    rights law.
