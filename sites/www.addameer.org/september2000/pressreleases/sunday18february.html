<h3> <a name="pcjp">Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace</a></h3>
<b>Terry Larsen:   International Protection for the Palestinian People is

an Urgent Must</b>

 <p>In a press conference, held in 
Gaza on

13 February 2001, the Special Representative of the United Nations

Secretary-General Mr. Terry Larsen urged the international 
community

to seriously consider providing international protection for the

Palestinian people. Mr. Larsen described the situation as very 
urgent

as never before. He said: “The Palestinian people need international

protection today. It was one of several issues discussed in the UN

Security Council in addition to other important issues related to the

economic situation”.

<p>
Mr. Larsen added: “The living conditions for the Palestinians are 
very

difficult. A reduction in violence is only possible through the

lifting off all restrictions imposed, by Israel, on the Palestinian

Territories. The Palestinian economy has suffered great losses”. He

affirmed: “According to data collected by different United Nations

agencies estimate about 50% of the Palestinians live below poverty

line. The World Bank estimated that at least 32% of the Palestinians

live under poverty line and that this ratio had increased to 50% since

the beginning of the current crisis”. Mr. Larsen affirmed that over

250000 Palestinians are unemployed.

<p>
The Special Representative noted the Israeli-imposed closures are

futile and jeopardize Israel’s security. He affirmed the Palestinian

Authority faces a severe financial crisis because Israel currently

withholds millions of dollars in tax levies it collects on behalf of

the Palestinian Authority. He called upon the international community

to put financial aid to the PA on top of its agenda. Mr. Larsen warned

regional tension would intensify should the present conditions persist

leading to more losses.

<p>
The Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace reiterates its calls to

the international community to expedite international protection for

the Palestinian people who face a campaign of genocide by the longest

belligerent occupation ever known. Israeli occupation forces intensify

its grip and siege over Palestinian cities, towns and villages by the

day. Israeli Special Forces units assassinate Palestinians in their

homes or cars in front of their children. The Israeli army is using

its mighty arsenal including helicopter gun-ships, tanks and naval

vessels to bombard Palestinian residential neighborhoods killing

unarmed Palestinian civilians. Israeli military used internationally

prohibited nerve gas against civilians in Gaza. Dozens of victims lay

in Gaza hospitals as a result of the brutal attack.

<p>
We call upon the international community, especially, the States Party

to the 1949 4th Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of

Civilians at Time of War to: - Honor its commitments and

responsibilities provided for in the Convention towards the

Palestinian people; - Intervene immediately to expedite international

protection for Palestinian civilians under the 33 year-old Israeli

occupation; - Ensure Israel’s respect of relevant resolutions of

international legitimacy.

<b>GCMHP Team Meets the UN Human Rights Inquiry Commission to 
the

Occupied Palestinian Territories</b>

                         

<p>



Dr. El-Sarraj:
<p>

“The Israeli military trapped the Palestinians.”

“The Israeli military establishment brought Sharon to power.”

“The Intifada started peacefully and spontaneously; but Israel’s

excessive use of force pushed Palestinians towards using arms.”

“Settlements are friction points, symbols of occupation and

humiliation.”

<p>
On 12 February 2001, a team from the Gaza Community Mental Health

Programme met the UN Human Rights Inquiry Commission to the Occupied

Palestinian Territories. The team consisted of Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj

(Director-General), Ms. Rawya Hamam (Community Mental Health

Specialist), Mr. Rafik Musalam (Legal Advisor), and Mr. Husam

El-Nounou (Public Relations Coordinator).

<p>
Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj gave a detailed explanation of the psychological

effects of Israeli violence on the Palestinian people. He stated that

exposure to traumas such as bombardment, loss of property, loss of

family members and friends, and\or injury has caused many

psychological and behavioral disorders to all sectors of society, but

especially to children. Dr. El-Sarraj indicated that Israel has

frightened civilians with unprecedented long hours of shelling unlike

anything it has done in years. He also explained that the Intifada is

part of the circle of violence in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. He

said that the conflict started because Jews, who were victims of

persecution, were now victimizing others as they expressed their

identification with their own aggressors.

<p>
Dr. El-Sarraj said that the cause for the eruption of the Intifada is

the wish for the Israeli right and military establishment to put an

end to the option of peace. He asked, “why did Sharon visit Al-Aqsa

for the first time in his life? Why was the extraordinary harsh

response to demonstrations in the days that followed the visit?” He

also pointed that the Intifada was a civilian uprising in the first

two weeks. However, Israel’s excessive use of force and the large

number of dead and wounded people had its desired reaction; that the

Palestinian would resort to arms. Dr. El-Sarraj also pointed to the

unprecedented level of anger and frustration prevalent among

Palestinians, which pushes the people towards more radical options.

<p>
On the other hand, the use of arms by Palestinians has intensified the

fear in Israel and radicalized the public mood. The goal was achieved;

Israel elected Sharon; and the peace process was paralyzed.

<p>
Dr. El-Sarraj indicated that the root of the conflict is the Israeli

occupation and settlements on Palestinian land. These settlements,

which are illegal according to international law, are a message of

humiliation to Palestinians, and a reflection of classical Zionist

ideology that is based on occupying Palestinian land by force and

uprooting its inhabitants. These Settlements are points of friction

and will continue to hinder any initiative to peace or living in peace

with the Palestinian people.

<p>
In reply to Israeli claims that Palestinians are pushing their

children to death, Dr. El-Sarraj said that such a claim is unfounded

and inhuman. It is based on the assumption that Palestinians are a

people not equal to others. This claim also degrades basic human

emotions of the Palestinian people. Instead of making this claim,

Israelis should ask themselves as to why Israeli soldiers are shooting

children in the first place and why they killed 13 peaceful Arab

Israeli citizens who were demonstrating in Israel itself. He pointed

that the occupation policies are a result of prevailing feelings of

racism. To them, everything is fair game, including killing children,

uprooting trees, and demolishing homes as long as they do not belong

to Israelis.
<p>

Ms. Rawya Hamam stated that in light of her work with children a large

percentage of them are suffering from a number of psychiatric

disorders. They include loss of concentration, isolation, poor school

performance, bedwetting, behavioral problems, and others. These

problems are caused by direct or indirect exposure to violence, being

around other victims of violence, or hearing about or watching

violence on radio or TV. She also indicated that GCMHP research shows

that 55% of children watched their fathers being beaten by Israeli

soldiers in the first Intifada. This shattered the image of the father

as a symbol of protection and power; thus leading to different mental

health problems among children.

<p>
Ms. Hamam said that Israel has violated children’s rights of life and

security by killing Palestinian children and frightening them. Israel

also violated their rights to education by bombarding schools. The

subsequent traumas will have long-term effects on children.
<p>

Mr. Rafik Musalam, the GCMHP Legal Advisor, talked about Israel’s

human rights violations of the 4th Geneva Convention which hold Israel

responsible for the safety of civilians at times of war. Contrary to

the Convention, Israel has destroyed property and used force in a

disproportional way to the perceived threat, and without

discriminating between civilian and non-civilian targets. These

violations had severe psychological and economic consequences of the

Palestinian people. Mr. Musalam submitted to the Commission samples of

high caliber bullets used against Palestinians.

<p>
Dr. El-Sarraj pointed that the closure and siege of towns, villages,

and camps created a number of social problems in Palestinian families.

Some of these problems are separation due to closures, increase in

domestic violence because of stress and unemployment, and an increase

in women’s problems. He also pointed to the effects of closures on the

professional work of the GCMHP and other Palestinian governmental and

non-governmental institutions.

<p>
At the end of the meeting, the GCMHP team submitted to the Commission

documents of Israeli human rights violations in general, and

especially with regard to the psychological and social aspects. These

documents included reports and pictures of cases treated by GCMHP and

reports of other organizations documenting these violations.

<p>
*
<p>
*35 year-old Anwar Mar’ee, a member of the Palestinian intelligence
services from Karawat Bani Hasan in Salfeet, died when a mob 
attacked
him and stabbed him to death. Mar’ee’s brother, Jalal, 32, stated to
LAW that he was killed at 4am on Friday 16 February 2001, when 
a mob
of masked men attacked him with sharp tools at his home near the 
main
road between Karawat Bani Hasan and Bedia, Salfeet. Mar’ee, a father
of 2, was a Fatah activist. PNA sources reported that collaborators
working for Israel forces killed Mar’ee.
<p>
*29 year-old Isam Al Taweel, a father of 3 from Hebron, was killed on
the same day when he was shot in the chest. According to eyewitness
statements to LAW, Isam was on the way to his home in Al Karantina
opposite the Jewish Avraham Avino enclave in Hebron when he got caught
in Israeli bombing of Al Karantina. He bled for some time before
anyone could reach him. According to LAW’s information, five other
Palestinians were wounded in the attack.
<p>
*Shakir Al Manasra, 23, from Bani Na’eem, Hebron, also died on Friday
16 February, when Israeli forces bombed the cow farm where he worked.
Eyewitness Jalal Faraj, 26, told LAW that he and three of his
colleagues were sitting in a room in the farm at 8:30pm when Israeli
forces started bombing. Ahmad Faraj Allah, 33, who was shot in the
stomach during the attack, died on Sunday 18 February. Ahmad had a
brother named Faraj who was killed in the first Intifada, and Ahmad
had married his dead brother’s wife. Also injured in the attack was
Manasra’s brother Yusif Mawas, 30, who was shot in the right shoulder
and left arm.
<p>
*With the death of Faraj Allah, the number of victims claimed by the
Israeli bombing of Palestinian residential areas since 6 October 2000
has reached 42 and the number of injured has reached 11,000.
<p>
*76 year-old Abdul Rahman Jum’a from Beit Leid in Tulkarem died when
Israeli soldiers delayed the car taking him to hospital for one hour.
Eyewitness Muhanad Jum’a told LAW:
<p>
“At 10am on Friday, we took Jum’a in a car to hospital in Tulkarem
after he felt a severe chest pain. When we arrived at the checkpoint
at the entrance of Tulkarem, we told the Israeli soldiers there that
we had with us a very ill man who needed to be hospitalised. They
refused to let us pass, but held us at the checkpoint for an hour.
Finally, when we arrived at the hospital an hour and a half later, the
doctor told us that Jum’a had passed away half an hour ago. The road
to the hospital normally takes half an hour.”
<p>
*Mohammad Al Hawamda, 25, from Al Samou’a, Hebron, and Omar Abu
Tarash, 20, from Al Kiya in Bir Al Sabia’a, died when Israeli police
chased Al Hawamda’s car, which hit that of Abu Tarash. Ismail Al
Hawamda, 25, was injured in the incident. Al Hawamda’a was on his way
home after a working day in Bir Al Sabia’a (within the Israeli
borders).

<p>*84 Palestinians were injured when Israeli forces attacked Palestinian
protesters in Hebron, Al Bireh and Deir Nitham and in the bombing of
Al Bireh. 6 of the injured were shot, 33 hit by steel bullets, 14 by
shrapnel and the rest suffered teargas inhalation.

<p>*LAW demands:<p>
1.   The Israeli Government to immediately stop the use of excessive and
indiscriminate force    and collective punishments against Palestinian
civilians. <br>2.   The establishment of an international investigation
committee based on United Nations    Security Council resolutions 1322
of Oct 7, 2000, to investigate the violations of    international
humanitarian law committed by the Israeli forces inside the occupied
   Palestinian territories. <br>3.   The international community must hold a
conference for the High Contracting Parties of the    Fourth Geneva
Convention in order to take practical measures to ensure Israel's
adherence    to the convention. <br>4.   The international community must
pressurize Israel to immediately put an end to the    occupation of the
Palestinian territories and effectively support the implementation of
the    Palestinian right to self-determination.
