<h3>Arab Cause Solidarity Committee</h3>
                         <b>DENOUNCING THE ATTEMPS TO DEMOBILIZE 
MADRID SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS IN SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINE PEOPLE BY THE SPANISH 
GOVERNMENT DELEGATE IN MADRID AND THE ISRAELI EMBASSY IN CONNIVENCE WITH UNCONTROLLED 
PSEUDO-ISLAMIST GROUPS</b> 
<p>The Arab Cause Solidarity Committee (Comité de Solidaridad con la Causa
Árabe) called for a demonstration today in front of the Israeli Embassy
in Madrid in order to protest for the brutal repression of the Israeli
Army against the Palestinian People, in support for the Palestinian
national rights and demanding the immediate stop of the occupation of
the Palestinian Territories as well as the evacuation of the Israeli
forces of the Palestinian Autonomous Areas.

<p>1.- For the second time in two weeks, the Spanish Governmental
authorities had denied the permit for the concentration —that was
requested by CSCA through the administrative urgent proceeding— 
invoking
that the current circumstances "does not justify the urgency for such
concentration". CSCA has lodge an appeal against such decision in front
of the High Court of Justice in Madrid, appeal that has been also
rejected by this judiciary body. In doing so, the Governmental Delegate
in Madrid and the High Court of Justice do not only contravene the
criteria of the Spanish Government and the European Union, that have
declared that the critical situation in Middle East is of extreme
danger, but also are showing with their decisions a clear political
backwards to the right in the public freedoms of this country, 
forbidden
the right of meeting and demonstration that the Spanish Constitution
guarantees for all citizens. Besides this, the Government authorities
are showing a lack of sensibility to the dramatic facts that are
happening in Palestine since the last two weeks.

<p>2.- Early in the morning the Israeli Embassy called to the media, TV’s,
radio stations and news papers saying that the concentration announced
for today Saturday, 14th by some media, was not  for today but for
tomorrow, Sunday, 15th. Fortunately, the most important media, 
surprised
by the fact that the Israeli Embassy was itself calling for the
demonstration of Sunday, disregarding the Israelis, went to the
concentration and covered it.

<p>3.- In fact, tomorrow, Sunday, 15th there will be another concentration
in front of the Israeli Embassy that CSCA will not support since it is
organized by some individuals that not represent neither the Arab 
and/or
Muslim community in Madrid not any organization but their hidden
interest. The fact that this groups have been using other calls and
demonstrations for launching certain Islamic slogans that have nothing
to do with the Palestinian claims neither with the solidarity of the
Spanish social organizations with Palestinian people, nor with the
ideology of the majority of the Arab community in Madrid, has created
tension and even clashes between demonstrators in previous
demonstrations. This groups are using an image of Islam stereotyped and
ridiculous that spoil the legitimate and historic claims of the
Palestinian people: their right to an independent, sovereign, 
democratic
and no-confessional Palestinian State. Curiously, this demonstration
previewed for Sunday, 15th , has been allowed by the Governmental
Delegate in Madrid.

<p>CSCA wants to call the attention to this three linked facts —denied
permit of the Madrid Government Delegate, the attitude of the Israeli
Embassy calling off the demonstration organized by CSCA and announcing
that of the Islamists for tomorrow, as well as the own demonstration of
such provocative groups— . Three of them have the same clear aim:
demobilize the social organizations in Madrid that want to express
—according with the above mentioned Palestinian historical claims and
rights— their solidarity with the Palestinian people in this days, 
their
condemnation of the brutal Israeli Army aggression against the
Palestinians and their demands for an immediate stop of the  Israeli
military occupation.

<p>The concentration organized by CSCA finally took place —all the
demonstrators, Spanish and Arab citizens, surrounded by a big 
contingent
of police— disregarding the decision of the  Government Delegate and 
the
answer of the High Court of Justice in Madrid, and despite the attempts
of the Israeli Emabssy in Madrid to cancel the cover up of the
demonstration by the media.

<p>Mr. Ehud Barak<br>
Prime Minister and Minister of Defense         ISRAEL

<p>Fax.: 00972 2 5664838
11 October 2000
<p>Dear Sir,
It is with grave concern that we have taken notice of reports of violations of medical neutrality related to the recent violent 
clashes 
in your country, and notably in the Gaza and West-Bank area.
The reported blocking of the Augusta Victoria and the Makassid 
Hopsitals 
in Jerusalem, the shooting at ambulances at Al-shuhuda's crossroad 
by 
the Nitsarim settlement nuear Gaza City and the reported shooting at 
medical personnel which resulted in killing 3 and wounding several 
others, are examples of violations of the Geneva Conventions to 
which 
Israel is a party. In particular, Article 9 (Protection of medical 
and 
religious personnel) of Part III of the Protocol Additional to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection 
of 
Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), states 
that 
"Medical and religious personnel shall be respected and protected 
and 
shall be granted all available help for the performance of their 
duties`.." and Art. 11 (Protection of medical units and transports) 
states that "Medical units and transports shall be respected and 
protected at all times and shall not be the object of attack".
The International Federation of Health and Human Rights 
Organisations 
(IFHHRO) is deeply concerned with
these developments and trusts that you will commission a proper 
independent investigation into the reported incidents. The IFHHRO 
also 
urgently requests you to agree to and cooperate with an 
international 
investigation into the reported incidents, as suggested by major 
human 
rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights 
Watch.
Furthermore, IFHHRO urges that all Israeli security forces respect 
the 
rights of civilians to unimpeded access to medical services and to 
the 
protection of medical neutrality at all times and in all places.
<p>Yours Sincerely,<br>
Adriaan van Es, MD, secretary

<b>Israeli Sniper Kills Young Man</b> 


<p>In Al-Fawar refuge camp at 11:00 pm last night, 13 October 2000, Shadi
Al-Wawi, 21, was shot by an Israeli sniper while he was on the roof of 
his
home.  No clashes were occurring at the time.  He died from two live
bullets, one to his head and one to his chest, apparently fired from a
distance of up to 250 meters.  Noting the circumstances surrounding 
this
attack, it was clearly an unprovoked, shoot-to-kill act of aggression 
by
Israel against a Palestinian civilian.  His death increases the 
Palestinian
death toll since 28 September 2000 to 91.

<p>LAW deplores this attack and calls upon the Israeli government to cease 
its
attacks against Palestinians civilians.


<p>Correction:
In our press release of 13 October, 19.20, we stated that Israel bombed
Jenin.  Actually, Israel bombed Jericho, and no bombs fell in Jenin.  
Please
accept our apology.

<h3>Democracy and Workers Rights Centre</h3>
<b>Palestinian Victims of the Israeli Racialism</b> 
<p>

The worker Abdullah Ramadan Abdullah Fayad, 22 years old and the worker
Mohammed Fatehi Hamdan Al-Najar, 21 years old are from Beni Shailah
village, Gaza Strip. Both of them are working in Tel-Aviv and living 
with
three other workers from the West Bank in a house rented by their 
employer.
Our fieldworker took their complaint as follows:

<p>On Monday October 9th, 2000 around 2:00 P.M., while we were staying
over-night inside a house in Shkhonat Tekva area, we were attacked tens 
of
settlers, wearing civilian clothes with hand guns (pistols), and others
with knives and axes. Some of the attackers intruded the house and the
others stood next to them. Incidentally, I saw one of them wearing 
civilian
clothes, carrying a pistol and hand cuffs.
The attackers broke in the house, and started beating and stabbing us,
shouting " We want no Arabs here".  We were five workers.  I was 
attacked
and tried to defend my self as much as I could, using a table which
protected me partially, nevertheless, I was stabbed in the right, left 
hand
finger, right hand, face, and feet, the wounds total 50 stiches. The 
attack
lasted 15 minutes continuously.
<p>No one came to help us, so we crawled  for about 30 minutes until we
reached the street whereby afew residents, one of them is Jewish and we
convinced him to call the police, few minutes later the Ambulance 
arrived,
and we were transferred to Tel Hashmir Hospital, and my collegue was
transferred to Ukhlef Hospital.
<p>The police took our statement, and we do not know what happened since 
then.

<p>Stated by The injured / Mohammed Al-Najjar                                            <p>  Received by
                        Nidal Ghaban
<p>Thursday 2:10 P.M.


<p>The Democracy and Workers' Rights Center holds the Israeli government 
and
the Histadrut responsible for the lives of the Palestinian workers who
could not till this moment return back to their houses due to the 
strict
Military closure imposed on the Palestinian occupied cities, villages 
and
refugee camps. DWRC call upon all human rights supporters and 
International
trade unions movements to stop these practices which is done by 
Israelis
against Palestinian workers.<p align=right><A HREF="#top">back to top</A>

<h3>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section</h3>
<b>DCI/PS VIEWS WITH GRAVE CONCERN THE EXISTENCE OF MUNITIONS REMNANTS
IN PALESTINIAN RESIDENTIAL AREAS</b> 





<p>DCI/PS views with grave concern the recent Israeli attack against
Palestinian civilians throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territories 
and
inside Israel proper.  Of particular concern to the organization is the
existence of munitions remnants, which have been found in areas where
confrontations are taking place between Palestinian protestors and the
Israeli military.  

<p>Since the clashes began over two weeks ago, numerous Palestinian 
civilians
have found munitions remnants, including grenades, sound bombs, 
missiles,
and bullets.  According to eyewitness testimony, at least one 
Palestinian
was injured after touching artillery fired by the Israeli army at the
Netzarim Junction in the Gaza Strip.  In a separate incident, 
Palestinian
children from Silwad village, near Ramallah, found a grenade that had 
been
partially deployed and was subject to explosion upon touch.

<p>DCI/PS research on the magnitude and effects of the problem of 
landmines
and UXO in the West Bank revealed that tens of Palestinians fall victim 
to
landmines and UXO each year, with an estimated 2,500 injured or killed
since 1967.  Moreover, the research indicated that the majority of 
these
victims are children. Since 1997, DCI/PS has documented 37 Palestinians
injured or killed by landmines or UXO.  Of those, 30 were children, 
with 7
killed and 23 injured.  In the past four months, 4 Palestinians have 
been
killed, including 3 children, and one injured as a result of UXO 
explosions.  

<p>DCI/PS reiterates its call for international intervention in the
deteriorating situation. In particular, DCI/PS calls on the 
International
Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and States Parties to the 1997 Ottawa
Treaty to utilize whatever means available to intervene  on behalf of
Palestinian civilians and to exert pressure on Israel to end its 
violent
attack on Palestinian civilians.

<p>Moreover, DCI/PS strongly urges all Palestinians residing in affected 
areas
to make their children aware of the danger and to avoid touching or 
picking
up suspicious objects. 

<p>For more information regarding the problem of landmines and unexploded
ordnance in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, please contact Ayed
Abueqtaish, Coordinator, DCI/PS Mine Action Project, at 240-7530.

<h3>Palestinian Center for Human Rights</h3>
<b>PCHR condemns attacks against private properties </b> 
<p>Israeli occupation forces continue their use of excessive force against
Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories, in which 
90
people have been killed and 2300 injured. Local, Arab and international
reactions have condemned this use of excessive force, including the use 
on
Thursday of combat helicopters to shell several areas in the West Bank 
and
Gaza Strip. The occupied Palestinian territories remain under military 
siege
and comprehensive closure resulting in social and economic suffering by
Palestinian civilians.

<p>In this context, PCHR is shocked by and deeply concerned about attacks
carried out yesterday afternoon by some people in Gaza City against 
private
properties. These properties were burned, apparently, because it was
believed that alcohol was sold on the premises.

<p>PCHR condemns these actions, which undermine the rule of law and place 
both
civilians and their properties in danger.

<p>Yesterday afternoon Palestinian people and national and Islamic forces
demonstrated peacefully to express their anger at the Israeli 
occupation
forces’ actions and crimes against Palestinian civilians. Some 
participants
in one of these marches in Gaza City attacked Al-Tahoona Hotel and
Restaurant (‘Windmill Hotel’) and burnt it.  They also attacked two 
houses
and one store and burnt them, with disregard for the safety of any 
civilians
present. According to information gathered by PCHR’s field officers, 
these
buildings were targeted because it was believed that alcohol had been 
sold
on the premises.

<p>PCHR strongly condemns such attacks against citizens’ properties, which
could threaten the lives of people on the premises.  Such actions 
cannot be
justified for any reason. PCHR calls on the Palestinian National 
Authority
to take the necessary legal steps to protect citizens’ lives and 
properties.
<p>PCHR calls also on all national and Islamic forces and NGO’s to 
denounce
such actions, particularly at this critical time, when efforts must be
concentrated on facing continued aggression by the Israeli occupation 
forces
against the Palestinian people.

<h3>Palestinian Center for Human Rights</h3>
<b>PCHR receives the UN Special Rpporteur to the occupied Palestinian and Arab 
territories</b> 
<P>The UN Special Rapporteur to the occupied Palestinian and Arab 
territories
Mr. Georgio Giacomelli, accompanied by Dr. Amin Mekki, representative 
of the
High Commissioner for Human Rights; Josef Shechla and Darka Topali 
visited
PCHR as part of his mission to the occupied Palestinian territories to
evaluate the current situation and report to the UN Commission for 
Human
Rights, which will convene a  special session in October 17-19, 2000 in
Geneva to solely discuss the conditions of human rights in the occupied
Palestinian territories.

<P>Raji Sourani, Director of PCHR, and PCHR’s staff met with Mr. 
Giacomelli and
briefed him on the Israeli blatant violations of human rights, 
specially in
the current crisis, providing him with legal documents and reports on 
the
Israeli occupation forces’ crimes against Palestinian civilians, in 
which 91
people have been killed and more than 2300 injured.


<P>Sourani emphasized the following legal demands to Mr. Giacomelli:

<P>1. A clear and crucial international condemnation of bloody, savage 
actions
by the Israeli occupation forces and settlers against Palestinian 
civilians,
and calling on Israel to immediately halt such actions in the occupied
Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem.

<P>2. Providing international protection for the Palestinian people in the
occupied Palestinian territories through international forces and the 
de
jure implementation of international law.

<P>3. The de jure implementation of Geneva Fourth Convention to protect
Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories, and 
urging
the High Contracting to reconvene the adjourned conference to pressure
Israel through practical and diplomatic steps to implement de jure the
Convention in the occupied Palestinian territories.

<P>4. Establishing an independent international commission of inquiry to
investigate the Israeli occupation forces’ crimes in the occupied
Palestinian territories.

<P>5. Sending the UN special rapporteurs to the occupied Palestinian
territories, specially the UN Special Rapporteur for the rights of the
Child, the UN Special Rapporteur for Extrajudicial Killing and the UN
Special Rapporteur for Judiciary,

<P>6. the UN Special Rapporteur for Non-Discrimination, and other relevant 
UN
special rapporteurs.

<P>7. Calling on the member European states to activate Article 2 of 
EU-Israel
Association Agreement, which calls on Israel to respect human rights, 
and to
adopt actions against Israel.

<P>8. Increasing the presence of the International Committee for the Red 
Cross
(ICRC) to protect civilians.

<P>Sourani called also on UNRWA to increase its services to assist the
Palestinian people in the current situation.  He strongly criticized 
UNRWA
for reducing its services and staff in the Gaza Strip in the past few 
years,
and transferring its administration to Amman.  Sourani condemned Kofi 
Anan’s
recent selective statements on the current situation in the occupied
Palestinian territories.

<P>PCHR called on Mr. Giacomelli to consider the meeting as a testimony by 
PCHR
before the UN Commission for Human Rights, as PCHR cannot be present to
deliver its testimony directly before the Commission, because of the 
closure
imposed on the Gaza Strip.

<P>Sourani thanked Mr. Giacomelli for his insistence to visit the occupied
Palestinian territories despite the pressure to cancel such visit.
