<b>PRCS HQ Catches Fire Due to Shelling
</b>


<p>Last night PRCS headquarters and central 
ambulance
dispatch in Ramallah were fired upon and hit several times with 
heavy
& explosive cannon fire causing the top floor to catch fire.  Israeli
army gunners from the nearby hilltop settlement of Psagot fired
continuously into the area for over 3 hours.  Ambulance dispatch 
was
paralyzed during this period. However, during this period, 
paramedics
managed to respond to a call from a nearby home that was on fire.  
The
crew evacuated the residents, extinguished the fire (fire trucks could
not reach the area due to heavy shelling) and provided first aid.
<p>
All telephone lines and the central 101 telephone for ambulance
dispatch were also hit and cut for the Ramallah region.  Other damages
included 3 water tanks on the roof top, and the PRCS mini-bus for the
disabled. PRCS HQ was also hit and damaged on Dec 31, 2000.  No
injuries were reported.
<p>
PRCS is dismayed at this pattern of behavior by the Israeli army
showing complete lack of respect for our medical humanitarian mission
and activities.  However, as we have always stated, we will continue
to provide emergency medical services to all in need, both Israeli and
Palestinian.
<p>
We again ask Red Cross/Red Crescent societies, the movement, and the
ICRC to protest these actions in the strongest of terms.

<b>Four Palestinians killed, more attacks on civilians and their property
</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
Preface
<br><br>
The first week of February 2001 witnessed more violations of
Palestinian rights in the occupied territories. Israeli forces
maintained excessive and lethal force in the face of Palestinian
protests, as well as other grave violations such as house 
demolition,
tree uprooting and arrests. On 6 February, Israel elected a new 
Prime
Minister: Ariel Sharon, whose provocative 28 September 2000 visit 
to
the Noble Sanctuary triggered the current crisis. Israel’s siege of
the Palestinian territories intensified during the election. This
week, Israeli forces killed two Palestinians, a third died of wounds
incurred on 29 January, and a Palestinian woman died as a result of
being prevented from reaching a hospital for treatment.

<br><br>
First: violating the right to life and security of person
<br><br>
* 20 year-old Ahmad Shihada from Jabalia refugee camp died after being
shot in the head on 2 February. According to LAW’s information, forces
stationed at Al Mintar (Karni) border crossing opened fire at a group
of Palestinian demonstrators. Shihada was hit from a distance of 600
metres by seven bullets in the stomach, chest, legs and head, although
he was not taking part in the demonstration.
<br><br>
* 21 year-old Abdullah Abu Karsh from Gaza was pronounced dead on 3
February after being wounded on 29 January by Israeli forces stationed
at Al Mintar (Karni) border crossing, who shot Abu Karsh in the head
while he was replacing a barricade that had been removed by Israeli
bulldozers.
<br><br>
* On 4 February Israeli soldiers stationed near the ‘Kisofeem’
settlement east of Khan Younis opened fire at 23 year-old Shadi Al
Kahlut from Gaza, hitting him ten times. He was left to bleed to death
and then his body was handed to the Palestinian District Coordination
Office. Israeli forces claimed that Al Kahlut had been trying to sneak
into Israel.
<br><br>
* At 3.45 pm on 5 February, 65 year-old Khadra Ishtawi from Kufr
Kadum, Qalqilya, died of a heart attack after being unable to cross an
Israeli military checkpoint to reach hospital in time for treatment.
Mahmoud Ishtawi, 44, stated to LAW that his mother had become ill at 2
pm. Mahmoud and his brother Nasir put her in a car and headed for
Nablus. As the road to Nablus was blocked, they had to take a
mountainous route, but were forced back by Israeli soldiers stationed
in the area. Khadra died in the car on the way back to Qalqilya. The
road to Nablus should normally take 12-15 minutes.
<br><br>
The wounded
<br><br>
Mohammad Swailim, 12, and Kamal Khadeer, 18, were wounded on 2
February 2001 near an Israeli military post south of Qalqilya.

custody. Mohammad Samha, 16, and Baha Hamad, 15, from Deir Nitham,

Gaza in the left thigh, Issa Al Amour, 14, from Deir Al Balah, in the
waist and Mazin Al Rifi, 35.
<br><br>
At 5 am on Saturday 3 February 2001, Israeli forces opened fire at the

wounding three: Mahmoud Al Awaysa, 17, who was shot in the face;
Muta’ab Al Jabareen, 23, shot in the left leg, and Raed Al Jabareen,
17, shot in the right leg. On the same day, Israeli soldiers attacked
Tahsin and Ismail Abdullah, two brothers from Burkin, Salfit.
<br><br>
On 4 February, 21 year-old Ashraf Al Asi was shot in the head during a
protest by Palestinian labourers at the Erez Industrial Estate. The

in Khan Younis, Al Barazil residential quarter, a Palestinian National
Forces post in Rafah and the town of Al Zababdi in Jenin. The bombing
wounded 16 year-old Nadi Al Fathawi and 14 year-old Ahmad Al Awadi,

<p>
Fourth: Settlement expansion, uprooting trees, harassment by settlers
<p>
On 5 February 2001, Israeli troops and armed settlers bulldozed 40
dunums of land belonging to the Al Alami and Ayash families in Beit
Umar, Hebron, with a view to building a new settlement for the
settlers of ‘Gush Izion’. Moreover, on 6 February armed settlers from
Ma’on placed caravans on the western hill of Yata, Hebron, with the
protection of the Israeli army.
<p>
At 3.55 pm on Thursday 8 February, a 7-passenger Palestinian service
taxi was travelling from Ramallah to Nablus when an Israeli Egged Bus
coming out of the Israeli ‘Yitzhar’ settlement overtook them. As the
bus went by, settlers inside it opened their windows and threw stones
on taxi, breaking several of its windows and damaging the car itself.
Fortunately, none of the passengers was hit. Neta Golan, a Canadian
peace activist married to a Palestinian, was in the taxi at the time.
She described the experience as frightening and dangerous.

<p>
Fifth: Detainees
<p>
At 11 pm on 5 February, a group of Israeli military, including several
masked men, broke into the home of Aisha Suleiman in Beit Hanina,
Jerusalem. They forced the residents out and arrested 29 year-old
Yasser Suleiman.
<p>
60-year-old Aisha told LAW that she, her son Shadi and his pregnant
wife were made to stand outside in the cold for two hours as the
masked agents physically assaulted Yasser. In the process, they also
smashed the furniture in the family’s kitchen and bedrooms.
<p>
An Israeli court placed two Palestinians under house arrest: Saliba
and Luay Khuri. Thair Halahla, detained at Nafha prison, informed LAW
that ten Palestinian prisoners have gone on hunger strike in protest
at being locked up with common criminals.

<p>
Sixth: Siege
<p>
41-year-old Musdik Al Sanuri, administrator at the Patients’ Friends
Society in Jenin, told LAW that on 3 February he received a call from
Dr. Abdul Razik Stati from Nazareth, general physician at the
Patients’ Friends Society clinic, saying that Israeli soldiers at Al
Jalami checkpoint had prevented him arriving at Jenin. The doctor
tried to convince the Israeli soldiers to let him through, but in
vain.
<p>

Seventh: Harassment and Intimidation
<p>
On Thursday 8 February at 12.30 am, 10 Israeli army jeeps and a
carrier ambushed Marda, a village in the Salfit district near Nablus,
throwing sound bombs and using their vehicles’ amplifiers. The
soldiers forced entry to several houses; when people opened their
doors the soldiers threw sound bombs inside, saying, “You are not
supposed to sleep quietly while your neighbours are having stones
thrown at them from here!”
<p>
1.   Hasan Said and four sons were interrogated by soldiers, who then
photographed his son Muneer, who works with the Palestinian National
Guards.<p> 2.   Fateen Khufash, the village councillor, was brought out of
his house with his two young children into the ain to be informed that
the village would be attacked if stones continued to be thrown at
nearby Israeli settlements. <p>3.   Israeli soldiers fired sound bombs into
the house of Jabr Ahmad Khufash, terrorising his small children. His
young daughter was severely traumatised by the noise and cannot stop
crying. <p>4.   Nasr Ja’afar Khufash and his 3 sons were dragged out into
the rain. <p>5.   Farouk Shakeeb Khufash was brought outside with his
daughters. <p>6.   Ryad Abdel-Rahma Khufash was brought out side with his
five sons. <p>7.   Soldiers broke down the door and threw sound bombs into
the house of Ra’ ed Faisal Khuffash. <p>8.   Shaher Khaffash, his 3 sons
and his sick brother were made to leave their home for almost ½ hour.
The soldiers took pictures to one of the sons, saying that they
thought he looked like a ‘terrorist’.
<p>
Nasfat  Abu Hassan from Marda and secretary of the Land Defence
committee told LAW that the ambush lasted 2 hours, during which time
the soldiers fired more than 60 bombs.

<p>

<p>
1.   Israeli forces are committing increased crimes against Palestinian
civilians. <p>2.   They are using the Israeli war arsenal against unarmed
Palestinian civilians. <p>3.   They continue to bomb and shell Palestinian
residential areas. <p>4.   They continue to use collective punishment
against Palestinians and deprive them of their basic human rights.

collective punishment against Palestinians. <p>2.   An international
investigation committee to be set up, working according to UN
Resolution 1322. <p>3.   The Contracting Parties to the 4th Geneva
Convention to ensure Israel’s compliance with the Convention.
