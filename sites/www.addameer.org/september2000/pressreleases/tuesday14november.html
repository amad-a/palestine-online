<p><b>   Three Palestinian civilians, including two children, killed by the
      Israeli occupation forces, and a fourth killed by settlers:
   More shelling of houses and continued leveling of agricultural land
                   owned by many Palestinian families
</b></p>


<p>The Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian civilians this
afternoon, killing a child from Gaza, a child from Al-Ama'ri refugee
camp, and a young man from Rafah.  Eyewitnesses stated that two of the
martyrs were not participating in any protest activities.  On
Ramallah-Nablus road, Jewish settlers attacked a resident of Askar
refugee camp, killing him immediately.  In the past 24 hours, the
Israeli occupation forces renewed the shelling of houses and civilian
facilities in the occupied territories.  They also swept a 155-donum
area of agricultural land in Khan Yunis.

<p> 1. Shooting at Palestinian Civilians

<p>This afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian
demonstrators in Khan Yunis, killing Rae'd Fahmi Shaqfeh, 23 years old,
from Rafah, with a live bullet in the side that settled in the back.
PCHR's field officer in Khan Yunis reported that, at about 15:00 local
time, Shaqfeh was on his way home.  After he passed by Al-Tuffah
roadblock between Khan Yunis city and Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area
which is under the security control of the Israeli occupation forces,
the Israeli occupation forces at the roadblock shot him from distance 
of
about 70 meters, using a gun provided with a silencer.    Clashes broke
out near Al-Tuffah roadblock between Khan Yunis city and Al-Mawasi
(agricultural) area which is under the security control of the Israeli
occupation forces, after the funeral procession of three martyrs from
the city, two of whom were killed yesterday and the third of whom died
from a previous injury incurred on November 11, 2000.  PCHR's field
officer reported that 16 Palestinian civilians, mostly children, were
wounded with live ammunition and another one was wounded with a
rubber-coated metal bullet, when the Israeli occupation shot at them.
He added that dozens of Palestinian civilians, including some children
and women in nearby houses, suffered from suffocation and fainting due
to inhaling tear gas used by the Israeli occupation forces.  Among the
wounded are:

<ul>
<li>Hassouna Walid Barbakh, 10 years old, wounded with a live bullet in
the right side of the chest;
<li> Rae'd Khali Al-Regeb, 18 years old, wounded with a live bullet in 
the
chest;
<li>Yousef Majdi Barbakh, 9 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the
right shoulder;
 <li>Jamal Sha'ath, 18 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the head.
 <li> Fayez Shehdeh Al-Najjar, 18 years old, wounded with a live bullet in
the right thigh, cutting an artery there; and
 <li>Mohammed Fathi A'rram, 16 years old, wounded with a live bullet in
the abdomen.</ul>

<p>In the area near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza City,
clashes broke out this afternoon between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces.  These forces shot at Palestinian
demonstrators from a distance of about 150 meters, killing the child
Mohammed Khater Al-E'jleh, 13 years old, from Al-Shojae'ya neighborhood
in Gaza, with a live bullet in the head.  In addition, nine Palestinian
civilians were wounded with live ammunition.  Among the wounded are:
 <ul>
<li> Hammam Edrees Maqat, 15 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the
abdomen;
<li> Mou'men Sae'id Baker, 16 years old, wounded with a live bullet in 
the
testes; and
 <li>Alla' Saleh El-Wadia, 18 years old, wounded with a live bullet in 
the
abdomen.
</ul>
<p>In the West Bank, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators
and the Israeli occupation forces at the northern entrance of Al-Bireh.
The Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian demonstrators, 
killing
the child Saber Khamis Ebrashi, 15 years old, from Al-Ama'ri refugee
camp, with a live bullet in the heart.  Eyewitnesses stated that the
child did not participate in the clashes.

<p>2. Attacks by Jewish Settlers against Palestinian civilians

<p>Jewish settlers have continued to attack and threaten the lives and
safety of Palestinian civilians.  In the latest escalation of this,
Jewish settlers attacked Mustafa Mahmoud Mousa Oleyan, 54 years old,
from Askar refugee camp near Nablus, with stones, while he was 
traveling
by his car from Ramallah to Nablus.  He was hit and killed by a huge
stone in his chest that was thrown from a short distance.

<p>3.  Shelling of, and Shooting at Houses

<p>Yesterday evening and this morning, the Israeli occupation forces
shelled residential neighborhoods in Deir El-Balah more than 600 meters
away from Kfar Darom settlement to the east of the town.  Eyewitnesses,
residents of the area, said that that the Israeli occupation forces
fired shells and heavy and medium bullets starting from 23:00 local 
time
until 1:00 this morning.  As a result, three Palestinian civilians were
wounded with splinters of live ammunition and shells.  They are:
<ul>
<li> Mohammed Daoud El-A'beet, 27 years old, wounded with splinters in 
the
left leg while he was passing by;
<li> Reem Yousef Al-Namrouti, 18 years old, wounded with splinters of
shells in the left arm while she was at home; and
 <li>the child Ahmed Yousef Al-Namrouti, slightly wounded under the left
eye by splinters of a shell, that hit his family's house.
</ul>

<p>Additionally, eight houses were damaged as follows:
<ol><li> The house of Ahmed Abdel-Aziz Boulan, 38 years old.  In his 
testimony
to PCHR, Boulan said: "At about 23:00 (local time), and while I was in
my house, which is about 600 meters away to the north of Kfar Darom
settlement, I heard sounds of shooting and explosions very close to my
house.  I, with my 11-member family, escaped to my brother's house,
which is 300 meters away to the west.  Shooting from the settlement
lasted for about an hour.  Then, I went back to my house, finding that
it was hit with shells and bullets.  Two shells penetrated a wall of 
the
house, making two holes 30 centimeters in diameter.  Interior windows
and walls were also hit by bullets."  He added that furniture in the
house was severely damaged, and that members of the Palestinian 
National
Security Forces who came to the house discovered that the remnants of
the shells proved that these were 400-millimeter shells.
<li>The house of Abdel-Hamid El-Naqla, 70 years old.  The house was hit
with five shells.  In his testimony to PCHR, El-Naqla said: "While my
wife and I were on the first floor of the house, and my daughter-in-law
and her two children on the second floor, I heard sounds of shooting 
and
explosions at about 23:00 local time yesterday, coming from the side of
the settlement.  We all escaped and sheltered behind trees in the
northern part of the house, away from the source of shooting.  Shooting
lasted for an hour.  Shooting and shelling renewed again and lasted
until 1:00 on Tuesday.  Then, we came back home, finding that one shell
hit the kitchen on the first floor, breaking its external window and
hitting the refrigerator; a second shell hit the kitchen of the second
floor, breaking its door, windows and some of its cooking utensils; and
a third one hit the stairs and entrance."
<li>The house of Yousef and Zakeya Mousa Al-Namrouti.  In her testimony
to PCHR, Zakeya Mousa Al-Namrouti, 43 years old, said: "At about 23:00
(local time) on Monday, my husband (Yousef), my seven children and I
were on the second floor of our house, which is 700 meters away to the
north of Kfar Darom settlement.  Suddenly, we heard sounds of shooting
and explosions.  We immediately escaped to the ground floor for
shelter.  We stayed there until 1:00 (local time) on Tuesday, November
14, 2000.  In the meanwhile, a shell penetrated a wall of the ground
floor, where we were sheltered.  We were very afraid.  My son Ahmed,
four years old, was slightly wounded under the left eye, and my 
daughter
Reem, 18 years old, was slightly wounded in the left arm with
splinters.  Then, we left home and went to a neighboring house about 
250
meters away to the west."
<li> The house of Mohammed Rajab Al-Khreibi, 65 years old.  His two-story
house was hit with three shells that penetrated the ceiling of its
stairs and destroyed a television reception network on its roof.
<li>The house of Hassan E'id Al-Enjili, 62 years old.  The house was hit

two shells in the wall on the roof.
<li>  The house of Mohammed El-Sayed Hammad, 24 years old.  It was hit
with heavy bullets that penetrated a television reception network on 
the
roof.  Bullets also penetrated the back glass of his car in front of 
the
house.
</ol>
<p> Sweeping of Agricultural Land

<p>Yesterday, at about 20:30 local time, a large number of Israeli
occupation troops swept vast areas of agricultural land measuring
150-300 meters wide on the sides of the road branching from Salah

<p>5. Continued Reinforcements and Blocking of Roads

<p>The Israeli occupation forces continued to reinforce their presence
throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.  In the Gaza Strip,
tanks and armored vehicles of the Israeli occupation forces have been
stationed on Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the north and
south of the Gaza Strip), near the roads leading to Gush Qatif
settlement block and the settlements of Kfar Darom and Morag, and on 
the
road leading to Kissufim Crossing in the east.  This morning, the
Israeli occupation forces closed Salah El-Din Street near Kfar Darom
settlement, preventing the movement of Palestinian citizens and
transportation in both directions.  The road is still closed.  The
Israeli occupation forces have continued their actions of collective
punishment by continuing to impose a total siege on the occupied
Palestinian territories, and by closing Gaza International Airport and
Rafah Border Crossing.


<p>PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to immediately
intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the
Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians.  PCHR calls in
particular for:

<p> 1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out
a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and killings
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian
civilians.
 <p>2. Convening a conference of the High Contracting Parties to the 
Fourth
Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure Israel's compliance with its
obligations under the Convention.
 <p>3. Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces
and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of these
forces.
 <p>4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic measures with
reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association Agreement which
calls for the respect of human rights.
<p> 5. Providing humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian
people whose living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because 
of
the continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on
the entire occupied Palestinian territories.

<h3>LAW</h3>
<p><b>Israeli settlers continue to attack Palestinian 
civilians
</b></p>



<p>Today, the 14 November 2000, Mustapha Ayl'an (54), was hit and killed 
by a
stone thrown allegedly by Israeli settlers. Ayl'an was driving his 
private
car from Ramallah to Nablus when he was fatally struck by a stone. Two 
year
old La'th Hosam Shukri was also attacked, allegedly by settlers, while
standing with his mother in the vicinity of Hawara village in the West 
Bank.
Shukri was badly injured in his left leg and was taken to Rafidieh 
hospital
in Nablus.

<p>Moreover, a curfew was imposed by the Israeli security forces on the 
village
of East Baka in the Tulkarem region, after clashes erupted between 
Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian youths.

<p>The establishment and maintainance of Israeli settlements in the 
Occupied
Territories strikes at the very core of the protective provisions of 
the
Fourth Geneva Convention. Settlements are prohibited pursuant to 
article 49
which states the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of 
its
own civilian population into the territory it occupies. Thus, Israel 
should
be held accountable for attacks against Palestinian civilians by 
settlers
because settlements have been built willingly and illegally by the
government of Israel, in blatant disregard to the security and rights 
of the
Palestinian civilian population. Indeed, by establishing and 
maintaining
Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories, Israel has increased 
the
risk of Palestinians having their fundamental rights violated, such as 
the
right to protection against all acts of violence, as stipulated in 
Article
27 of the convention.

<p> The imposition of curfew as a form of collective punishment is 
outlawed in
Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. This implies that no person
should be held responsible for acts that he or she did not commit. This
general principle prohibiting all forms of collective punishment has 
been
consistently  violated by the Israeli security forces.
<p>
LAW demands the immediate implementation of all the relevant provisions 
of
international humanitarian law (the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 
Hague
Regulations).

<p>LAW demands that Israel implement United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338 and General Assembly resolution 194.

<h3>The Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees</h3>
<p><b>Appeal Update<br>
Schools Shelled in Tulkarem
</b></p>




<p>Today the Israeli government imposed another closure on the West Bank 
and
Gaza Strip.  Once again, Palestinian cities and towns are surrounded by
tanks and Israeli military personnel and travel between towns is nearly
impossible.  The IDF is also threatening to institute a policy in which
citizens would be required to apply for permits to travel from one
Palestinian city to another, further imprisoning the captive 
population.

<p>In the past week, Israeli Forces shelled one college and four schools 
in
Tulkarem.  In one school, the top floor was significantly damaged and 
there
were holes approximately 1-2 meters in diameter in the walls from the
missiles.

<p>According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education, 40 schools 
throughout
the West Bank and Gaza have been closed, leaving 20,000 children unable 
to
attend classes.  The schools were shut because of the Israel army's 
closure
on Palestinian areas; students were simply not able to reach their 
schools.
In Hebron, the Israeli army has occupied 4 schools for more than 35 
days,
using them as temporary military bases.

<p>These attacks constitute a grave violation of Palestinian children's
educational rights.  The attacks also disrupt the educational process 
by
psychologically terrorizing the students.

<p>Photos of the shelled schools in Tulkarem can be viewed on the UPMRC 
website
http://www.upmrc.org.


<p>The UPMRC is deeply concerned over the attacks on Palestinian schools.  
We
call upon the international community to insist that Palestinian 
civilians
receive international protection from a military that is waging war 
against
an unarmed population.
