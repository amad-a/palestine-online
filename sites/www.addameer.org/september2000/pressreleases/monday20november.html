<p><b>The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continue to besiege the 
Palestinian cities in the Occupied Territories, and prevent the 
entrance of fuel in the Gaza Strip </b></p>




<p>In the most dangerous deterioration of the situation in the Occupied 
Territories since 29/9/2000, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces 
have reinforced the military siege imposed on the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. They have maintained the closure of the crossings and 
international airport in the Gaza Strip, and continued to isolate the 
cities of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from each other. They also have 
completely blocked the entrances of the Palestinian cities and 
villages. Moreover, they have prevented the entrance of fuels to the 
Gaza Strip since 17/11/2000. Since Thursday, 16/11/2000, the 
belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have prevented two ships from 
unloading 4200 Tons of gas, imported by Palestinian companies for the 
use of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in the harbors of Ashdod and 
Ashkelon. The daily needs of the Gaza Strip of gas are 100 Tons, while 
its daily needs of car petrol is 500.000 liters. This situation will 
lead to complete paralysis of the public life. It will prevent the 
functioning of hospitals including the operating theatres and 
ambulances, bakeries, and factories, which all need fuel to function. 

<p>The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have continued to destroy 
the property of Palestinian civilians. This morning (20/11/2000), they 
have bulldozed tens of dunams of agricultural land near Kfar Darom 
Jewish settlement and Almuntar/ Karny crossing in the Gaza Strip. They 
also have closed all the roads which connect the southern half of the 
Gaza Strip with its northern half. Moreover, they have randomly opened 
fire on Palestinian civilians near Salah Addeen border-gate in Rafah 
leading to the injury of: 1. Rafat Mohammad Abu Libdah, 35 years old, 
injured in the chest. 2. Bassam Abd Assalam Alqadhy, 21 years old, 
critically injured in the chest. 3. Mohammad Mousa Zurub, 15 years 
old, injured in the thigh. 

<p>We, at AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights, stress that the Israeli 
aggression against the Palestinian civilians in the Palestinian 
Occupied Territories reflects a general/public policy aiming to impose 
collective punishments upon the Palestinian civilians and create a 
state of starvation among them. This policy constitutes a grave breach 
to the international humanitarian law. Based on this, we stress our 
previous requests that the international community should immediately 
intervene to provide protection for the Palestinian civilians and to 
put an end to the Israeli violations of human rights in the Occupied 
Territories.

<p><b>IUrgent Appeal to the International Community as Gaza Strip is Under Heavy Bombardment, Collective Punishment of Palestinian Civilians Borders Crisis Levels 
</b></p>

 
<p>At the time of writing this press release there were reports that the Israeli Occupying Forces, at 6:00pm this evening, had begun a heavy missile bombardment of the Gaza Strip, striking by helicopter gunships at Palestinian military and civilian locations. Electricity has been cut and the Palestine TV, the Preventive Security and the National Security was also damaged by missile attack. All areas of the Gaza Strip have been under attack. Many people have left their homes and are running in the streets in panic. The number of casualties and damage to property has not yet been reported but al-Haq will continue to monitor the situation. <p>Al-Haq again is appealing to the international community with a sense of urgency regarding the fate of the Palestinian people under Israeli Military Occupation. The safety and security of Palestinians continues to be threatened by punitive measures implemented by the Israeli Occupying Forces and their unwillingness to stop and/or prevent acts of Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians.<p> The Israeli Forces’ continued military closure of the Occupied Palestinian Territories is a punitive action, illegal under international law. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states: <p> No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. <p>Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited. <p> Pillage is prohibited. <p>Reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited. <p> The Israeli Forces, once again, have reinforced and intensified the military closure completely isolating Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Entrances to Palestinian cities and villages have been blocked (in some cases by Israeli Settler blockades). Areas near the Kfar Darom settlement in the Gaza Strip have been bulldozed destroying Palestinian property. The Israeli Forces have closed the Karni Crossing since November 17, 2000 resulting in the exhaustion of supplies of car petrol, gas for cooking and oil for heating. Without these supplies, the Gaza Strip will be completely immobilized. Without gas, Gaza vehicles will stop, Gaza hospitals and operating rooms cannot function, ambulances cannot move, and bakeries and factories cannot operate. <p>We also urge the international community to take the necessary steps to provide food and essential supplies to those Palestinians under siege in the Gaza Strip and to pressure the Israeli Occupying Forces, by any means necessary, to lift the siege imposed on the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Israeli Occupying Forces must take full responsibility for the deterioration for the respect of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

<h3>American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee</h3>

<p><b>ADC Press Release: 
Israel Again Bombs Defenseless Palestinian Cities; 
International Protection for Palestinians Urgently Required 
</b></p>




<p>Washington, D.C., Nov. 20 - - The American-Arab Anti- Discrimination 
Committee (ADC), the nation’s largest Arab-American membership 
organization, has reiterated its urgent call for international 
protection for the Palestinian people following another air raid 
against Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. Israeli 
helicopter gunships fired missiles at several civilian targets in Gaza 
today, knocking out power in much of the city. These attacks appear 
to be official Israeli vengeance for the bombing of an Israeli settler 
bus in Gaza yesterday. Palestinian officials deny any connection with 
the bus attack and Israel has not accused the PA of responsibility for 
it, yet Israel has chosen to respond by attacking civilian and public 
targets connected to the authority. This bombing is the latest 
escalation of Israel’s violent suppression of Palestinian protests 
against 33 years of Israeli occupation in East Jerusalem, the West 
Bank and Gaza. 

<p>In a letter to President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright, ADC 
President Hala Maksoud called upon the U.S. government to use its 
influence to allow the international community to extend the necessary 
protection to the defenseless Palestinian people. She wrote that 
“this outrageous attack seems designed to undo any possibility of a 
lowering of tensions and a peaceful end to Israeli occupation. There 
can be no further doubt about the urgent need for an international 
force to protect the Palestinian people from these continuous attacks 
by Israel’s occupation troops. Israel has gone from using live fire 
and tanks against protesters, to assasinating Palestinian leaders, to 
repeatedly bombing defenseless Palestinian cities. It is clear that 
the Israelis will stop at nothing to enforce their occupation. The 
international community can no longer stand by and watch this 
slaughter continue. The Palestinians need protection now.” 

<p>More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in 
recent weeks, many of them children. Yesterday, Israeli soldiers shot 
three more Palestinians, including a 14 year old child. The Israeli 
newspaper Ha’aretz reports today that Israel has given its soldiers 
“shoot to kill” orders against all Palestinian protesters over the age 
of 12. On Oct. 19, The UN Human Rights Commission voted to condemn 
Israel for ``widespread, systematic and gross violations of human 
rights” and ``the indiscriminate use of force in violation of 
international humanitarian law.” Amnesty International has also 
condemned the "excessive use of lethal force" by Israel and the 
killing of large numbers of unarmed children. On October 7, the UN 
Security Council condemned "acts of violence, especially the 
excessive use of force against Palestinians, resulting in injury and 
loss of human life" and "called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to 
abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities 
under the Fourth Geneva Convention."

<p>Out of the common human values between Islam and Christianity which 
defend> human dignity and rights, Al Azhar and the Christian Churches 
in Egypt reject the aggression of Israel on the Palestinians and their 
properties and the unjust and murders of the innocent. 

<p>We Muslim and Christian leaders reject and denounce the inhuman 
practices of the Israeli Army on Islamic and Christian Holy places in 
the Palestinian cities especially El Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. We, the 
Islamic and Christian leaders agreed unanimously that all the sraeli 
aggressive practices against the Palestinians is against all human 
rights, religions and all International Laws.We plead to all Nations 
and Governments of the world and all International organizations to 
intervene immediately to stop the Israeli wild attacks on Palestinians 
and to withdraw from the occupied territories allowing the 
Palestinians to have their rights in resisting Israeli occupation and 
establishing their independent country with Jerusalem as its capital. 

<p>We appeal to the leaders of the Arab and Islamic and all Nations, 
Governments all over the world, the leaders of the Churches and 

international organizations that work in human relief to offer their 
urgent humanitarian help and support to the Palestinians as they face 
all kinds of humiliation and starvation by the Israeli Government."

<p>
This evening, the Israeli army launched intensive air strikes on the
Gaza Strip. The attacks, which were carried out with helicopter
gunships, started at around 6 pm local time and lasted for over an
hour. A number of missiles were fired on Gaza City, Khan Yunis,
Rafah
and Deir Al-Balah. During the attacks, electricity was knocked out
in
Gaza City. A power station under construction, the building of the
Palestinian TV station, the Fatah headquarters in Gaza City and a
number of buildings housing different Palestinian security services
were hit. Gaza harbour was also slightly damaged. As result of the air
strikes, 26 people were reportedly wounded, two of them seriously.

<p><b>PALESTINIAN CHILDREN CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION ON THE 11th 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE UN CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
</b></p>



<p>Today marks the 11th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of 
the Child (CRC), the most widely-ratified human rights treaty in 
history. The CRC, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 
resolution 44/25 on 20 November 1989, constitutes the main legal 
framework outlining the universal rights of children. Article 2 of the 
Convention, which entered into force in Israel on 2 November 1991, 
obliges States Parties to ensure the rights contained therein, both in 
the territory of the state itself, and in areas under its control. 
Moreover, article 4 requires that States Parties take "all appropriate 
legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation 
of the rights recognized" in the Convention. To date, Israel has not 
only failed to submit the required country report to the UN Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, as required by article 44, it has engaged 
in a pattern of gross and systematic violations of Palestinian 
children's rights. 

<p>In the period since 28 September alone, 66 Palestinians under the age 
of 18 have died as a direct result of Israeli military and settler 
presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. An additional 6 Palestinian 
children have been declared clinically dead and over 2,000 have been 
injured. Moreover, thousands of Palestinian children have been 
traumatized as a result of the daily exposure to violence and repeated 
attacks by Israeli military forces on Palestinian residential areas. 
It is important to note that the events of the past two months are an 
intensification of violations of children's rights committed 
throughout the over 33 years of Israeli occupation of Palestinian 
territories. Moreover, they are the manifestation of the 
international community's failure to ensure that Israel comply with 
its obligations under international law. 

<p>In commemoration of the anniversary of the CRC, over 1,000 Palestinian 
children in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Jenin and Bethlehem 
participated in children's marches designed to raise international 
awareness of Israel's ongoing violations of Palestinian children's 
rights. The marches, which were organized by DCI/PS, in coordination 
with numerous local and international organizations, called for an end 
to such violations by Israeli soldiers and settlers and urged the 
international community to take immediate action to ensure that Israel 
uphold its obligations under international law as well as provide 
temporary international protection for the Palestinian people. Letters 
highlighting the human rights violations suffered by children daily, 
with special attention to Israel's violations of the CRC, were 
presented by participating children to the offices of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross in each town, as well as to 
local media. The marches culminated in children's festivals, during 
which the letters were read to all present. 

<p>DCI/PS views with grave concern the ongoing and systematic violations 
of Palestinian children's rights by the Israeli occupation authorities 
and joins Palestinian children in calling for temporary international 
protection for Palestinian civilians residing in the West Bank, 
including Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip.

<p><b>Daily report on settler's violence against Palestinians 
</b></p>





<p>-There were further violent incidents in the village of Hares near the 
settlement of Ariel. A settler damaged one of the villagers' cars and 
then called the Ariel police, who proceeded to attack the villagers 
with tear-gas. The settlers then congregated at the western entrance 
of Hares in an attempt to seal the entrance to the village. The IDF 
were present at the site but did not take action. 

<p>-In the Baka valley the Jaber family was attacked by settlers from 
nearby Qiryat Arba and Givat Harsina settlements for the fifth time in 
three weeks. Hundreds of settlers threw stones at the houses, 
destroyed fields, pulled up plants and pipes and broke irrigation 
sprinklers. They also made a fire on the road in order to block it 
off. 

<p>-Ayman Abdel Majid (aged 32) from Bani Na'im near Hebron was attacked 
and severely beaten by Israeli settlers. He was taken to hospital. 

<p>- In Hebron Israeli settlers attacked the Cortaba Elementary Girls' 
School , entering the school and beating a number of students. The 
Israeli military then arrived at the school and shot gas cannisters 
into the school as well as live ammunition. 

<p>-In the Qalqilya area, Salem Shawahneh (aged 19) was injured by live 
ammunition when Israeli settlers from the nearby settlement of Kari 
Shabon shot at him unprovoked. 

<p>-Near the village of Kufr Kadom, Israeli settlers uprooted a 
large number of olive trees and destroyed agricultural lands. 

<p>-Mohammad Abdel Khalik, from Ya'abad (near Jenin) was shot by Israeli 
settlers from the settlement of Shafi Shamron, while driving near them 
on his way to take his wife to a hospital in Nablus. Settlers opened 
fire on the car, hitting and injuring him several times with live 
ammunition. 

<p>-In Ya'bad a number of residents were prevented from reaching their 
olive orchards and were beaten by Israeli settlers and soldiers.

<p><b>Gaza Strip attacked at 18:00 by Israeli occupation forces: 
Dozens of injured reported at Shifa’ Hospital 
</b></p>




<p>PCHR wants to inform readers that Gaza came under rocket attack at 
18:00 local time. Explosions were heard throughout Gaza City. Gaza 
City had its electricity cut and this could only be sent through the 
use of a private generator. Dozens of wounded people have been taken 
to Shifa’ Hospital. Attacks have also been reported in Rafah, Khan 
Younis, and other locations in Gaza. 

<p>PCHR’s normal press release will not be distributed today but should 
be sent out tomorrow morning. A Palestinian youth was shot dead in 
Rafah earlier in the day. A man in his fifties died as a result of 
inhaling tear gas in an incident that took place last week. Many 
Palestinian civilians were injured in the upper body. Leveling of 
Palestinian land continued. 

<p>PCHR condemns this enormous escalation of violence on the part of the 
Israeli occupying forces. PCHR calls on the international community 
to take immediate steps to protect Palestinian civilians. 

<p>PCHR calls on all concerned readers to contact their political 
representatives and to urge them to support an immediate international 
protection force for Palestinians civilians suffering under occupation 
and a grossly disproportionate military attack from Israeli occupation 
forces. Shelling, missile attacks, and willful killing of Palestinian 
civilians are absolutely unacceptable and should not be allowed to 
become a part of daily Palestinian life.
