<b>AL-RABAT CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFUGEES:
Press release (CIHR) and Al-Rabat Declaration</b>

<p>

1. CIHRS Press Release:
Human Rights Organizations Call for Expelling Israel from the 
United
Nations
<p>
The Third International Conference of the Human Rights Movement in the
Arab World called upon the League of Arab States to take the practical
measures necessary for expelling Israel from the United Nations. This
is based on Israel's violation of one of the conditions for accepting
its membership to the UN in 1949, that is its failure to implement the
UN Resolution 194 of 1948 that requires it to allow the return of the
Palestinian refugees to their homes and to pay compensations.
<p>
This was part of the recommendations of the Rabat Declaration on the
Rights of the Palestinian Refugees. The Rabat Declaration was adopted
by the conference organized by the Cairo Institute for Human Rights
(CIHRS), in coordination with the Moroccan Organization for Human
Rights and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, from 10 to 12
February 2001 in Rabat, Morocco.
<p>
The conference started with keynote addresses by Mr. Muhammad Ugar,
the Moroccan Minister for Human Rights, and the representatives of the
organizers. The inaugural session was chaired by Mr. Khaled el-
Nassery, Chairman of the Arab League's Permanent Committee for Human
Rights. The conference was attended by human rights organizations from
7 Arab countries and from Palestine of 1948, Arab and foreign experts,
academics, jurists, officials, in addition to representatives of
international human rights organizations, the United Nations, and Arab
and foreign diplomats.
<p>
The conference discussed 13 papers on five themes. Four major 
international human rights organizations gave statements on their
positions on the Palestinian refugees issue. They were: Amnesty
International, The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, The
International Federation for Human Rights, and Human Rights Watch.
<p>
In its closing session, the Conference discussed the Rabat 
Declaration (attached) setting out the main recommendation. Moreover,
the conference made three practical recommendations:
<p>
1- Charging the CIHRS with submitting the conference's 
recommendations as embodied in the Rabat Declaration to: the 
Secretary General of the Arab League, for presentation to the next
Arab summit in March in Amman; the Secretary General of the United
Nations; the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; the
United Nations Human Rights Commission; Sweden, in its capacity as the
president of the European Union during this period; and the
international human rights organization.
<p>
2- Calling upon the Palestinian organizations in the West Bank, Gaza
and Palestine of 1948, to follow up the conference's recommendations,
in coordination with the Arab networks in Europe and the United States
concerned with the implementation of the right of return.
<p>
3- Calling upon the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency
and Refugee Rights, Palestine, to continue its work for documenting
all the information and documents pertaining to the refugees, in
cooperation with the concerned organizations and networks.

2. Future of the Palestinian Refugees under the Current Political
Settlement
<p>
The Third International Conference
of the Human Rights Movement in the Arab World
<p>
THE RABAT DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIAN REFUGEES
<p>
The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS), in cooperation
with the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights and the Euro-
Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN), with the participation of
experts and representatives of Arab and international human rights
organizations, and with generous facilitation from the Moroccan
government, organized the Conference on the Future of the Palestinian
Refugees under the Current Political Settlement/the Third
International Conference of the Human Rights Movement in the Arab
World from the 10th to the 12th of February, 2001, in Rabat, Morocco.
<p>
The participants,
<p>
Having reviewed the relevant international human rights declarations,
conventions and covenants and the Casablanca Declaration issued by the
First International Conference of the Human Rights Movement in the
Arab World, 
<p>
Having reviewed the papers presented to the Conference, 
<p>
Having examined the tragic and inhuman conditions of the Palestinian
refugees and displaced persons in the homeland and the Diaspora for
more than fifty-two years,
<p>
Having considered Israel's intransigence and refusal to comply with
the resolutions of international legality on the refugees' right to
return and compensation, and the Israeli continuous practices of
banishment, displacement and human rights violation,
<p>
Having considered the attempt by some international parties to 
circumvent the resolutions of international legality by suggesting
permanent settlement in the host countries and compensation as an
alternative to compelling Israel to comply with the will of the
international community,
<p>
Decide to adopt the following declaration.
<p>
The Conference affirms that:
<p>
First: Israel bears full responsibility for creating the Palestinian
refugees issue, through systematic expulsion, whether direct or
indirect, massacres, killings, terror and intimidation. These acts are
corroborated by Israeli documents as well as testimonies by some
Israeli officials and historians. Israel bears the responsibility in
full also because of its persistent rejection of the return of the
Palestinian refugees.
<p>
Second: According to the UN General Assembly Resolution 194, the
Palestinian refugees' right of return to their homes and property is a
personal right for every individual and a collective right for the
refugees as a whole. No one is to be authorized to conclude any
agreement that denies refugees, individually or collectively, their
right of return.
<p>
Furthermore, the establishment of the Palestinian state, or a 
refugee's acquiring of another nationality, does not deny refugees the
right to return to their own towns and villages.
<p>
Third: Compensation for property usurped and for the grave 
psychological, economic and social suffering of Palestinians for more
than fifty-two years is not an alternative to the enforcement of the
right of return. Indeed, as the UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of
1948 sets out, compensation should be paid in addition to return.
<p>
Fourth: Any political settlement that does not ensure the rights of
the Palestinian refugees will not lead to a lasting, comprehensive
peace in the region. The Conference reaffirms that the international
community bears the main responsibility for enforcing resolutions
adopted by its institutions concerning the Palestinian people's
enjoyment of their right to self-determination, the return of the
Palestinian refugees to their homes, and providing them with
international protection until their return.
<p>
Fifth: Pending the implementation of the Palestinian refugees' right
of return, they must enjoy their human rights to the full, namely
their civil, social, economic and cultural rights, in the (temporary)
Arab host countries. The Conference further reaffirms that
safeguarding these rights is not the same as permanent settlement in
host countries, which is rejected by Palestinians and Arabs in
general. Nor does it mean relinquishing the right of return. Rather,
it helps support the refugees' resistance to attempts to eliminate
this right.
<p>
Sixth: Arab host countries are responsible for enforcing the relevant
Arab League resolutions, conventions and recommendations. The
Conference calls for putting an end to the gross infringements of the
international and regional resolutions on the rights of Palestinian
refugees in a number of Arab host countries. It is incumbent upon
international and Arab human rights organizations to dedicate more
attention to such condition.
<p>
Seventh: The Conference urges international and regional development
agencies and donor states to provide the necessary financial support
to:
<p>
1- The Arab host countries, in order to realize all of the economic
and social rights of the Palestinian refugees.
<p>
2-Civil society institutions in the Palestinian communities, so as to
be able to carry out their role in improving their conditions.
<p>
3- The Palestinian National Authority, so as to enable it to 
accommodate the Palestinians displaced in the wake of the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip
after the June 1967 war. 
<p>
4- The UNRWA, in support of its role concerning the Palestinian 
refugees.
<p>
Eighth: The Conference reaffirms the right of the Palestinians 
displaced within Israel to return to their original towns and 
villages, to reclaim their property, and to be compensated for their
damages and suffering. Institutions working towards the implementation
of these rights should receive support.
<p>
Ninth: Israel's continued rejection of the implementation of UN 
General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948, which was one of the 
conditions for its admission to the UN according to General Assembly
Resolution 273 of May 11th, 1949, leads in effect to annulling the
decision to accept its membership. This makes it obligatory that the
United Nations expel Israel and impose sanctions on it until it
complies in full with UN resolutions. Accordingly, the Conference
calls upon the League of Arab States to start forthwith taking the
practical measures necessary for implementing this recommendation.
<p>
Tenth: The forced displacement of millions of Palestinians because of
the acts of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Israel, which included
slaughters and acts of brutal terrorism, are crimes against humanity
to which statutory limitations do not apply. The relevant civil
society institutions as well as international and Arab human rights
organizations should perform their duty to work for bringing
perpetrators of such crimes to international justice, including
working for the establishment of an ad hoc criminal tribunal.
<p>
Eleventh: The Conference reaffirms its profound appreciation of the
international organizations and networks that took a principled stand
in supporting the Palestinian refugees' right of return, and urges
them to further their efforts in this regard. The Conference also
calls upon the international and Arab human rights organizations to
coordinate their efforts in this regard with the networks organizing
the international campaign for the implementation of the Palestinian
refugees' rights to return and compensation.

<b> Press Review:
Preventing Arab workers from using their mother tongue</b>

                         

Long reports and testimonies were published during this week 
documenting the discrimination against Arab workers in a 
restaurant company called “Yehuda Afazi”. The company has 
restaurants in Haifa, Hertzelia, Holon, Tel-Aviv, Kfar Saba and 
Natanya. <br><br>
“The Voice of worker Association” in Nazareth had published a 
full coverage of testimonies of Arab workers in this restaurant 
after “Black October” clashes. <br><br>
Fasl Al-Maqal published the first part of the Association’s report 
about the Arab workers’ suffering. The workers claim that the 
request of “not speaking Arabic during work came up after the 
Black October clashes, when they became a target (see Weekly 
Press Review-No.6).<br><br>
Ibrahim Mahajna from Umm Al-Fahm town says in his testimony: 
“After I was injured by Jewish mobs in Tel-Aviv and after 
calming the situation, I tried to come back to work, but the boss 
refused saying that he does not want any Arab workers in Tel 
Aviv and do not w ant to hear the Arabic Language”. <br><br>
Mahajna said as well that their Arabic names were switched to 
Hebrew names in order not to be recognized as Arabs by the 
restaurant customers, for example: worker with family name such 
as Jabarin was switched to “Gabi” and this was a condition in 
order to not be fired”. <br><br>
Assad Ailie, another worker from Umm Al-Fahm reported “he 
was working in this company for about 4 years. After the October 
clashes new instructions were given due to work’s conditions. 
The most important and insulting one refers to preventing us 
speaking Arabic between us or with Arab costumers.” <br><br>
A serious discussion developed between the worker and his boss 
as Ailie says: “I refused speaking in Hebrew with my friends and 
declared that we are Arabs, we will remain Arabs and we will die 
as Arabs. The next day I was fired”. (Ayyam Al-Arab, Friday 
16). <br><br>
Al-Sinnara (Friday 16) resembles the Arab workers’ situation in 
this company to the Apartheid government. 
Faruq Mahajna from Umm Al-Fahm was a witness to this 
discrimination. 
Farug attended the restaurant as a costumer. The waiter was 
Arabic from Umm Al-Fahm, which he recognized. “We start 
speaking in Arabic when the shift responsible came to the waiter 
and ask him to speak in Hebrew.” 
The managing-director of the company, Mr. Tsfvika Wolf refuses 
all those testimonies claiming that “they never prevented their 
Arab workers from speaking their mother tongue, but they just 
asked them to speak with low tone”. This reaction was received 
in “The Voice of worker Association” in February 11. 
Moreover two Arabic partners in this company, Jamel Mahajna 
and Adnan Mahajna, called Al-Sinnara and Sawt Al-Haqq Wal-
Hurriya reacting to the workers: “We have 220 Arabic workers 
which is about 80% of our workers in the company. We love and 
respect them. We do prevent screaming and shouting but we 
never prevent them speaking in Arabic.” 
“Switching Arabic names to Hebrew names is a slander.” Jamel 
claims. 

<br><br>The District Court permits Arabic Advertisings<br><br>
The District Court in Haifa permits the Arab students in the 
“West Galilee College” to advertise in Arabic. 
“The College prevented the Arab students from publishing in 
Arabic unless translating the whole text to Hebrew”. Sawt Al-
Haqq Wal-Hurriya (Friday 16.) 
The students appeal to “The Association for the Right of the 
Citizen”.<br><br>
Mr. Yosseff Jabarin, the Advocate of this association appealed to 
the District Court on 1999. (Al-Sinnara, February 13). <br><br>
Judge Yitzhak Shveli in his decision on Monday to permit Arabic 
advertising with a translation of the title only, wrote in his decision: 
“the right of speaking and expression must be taken as a primary 
right of human being; moreover, publishing an advertising in 
Arabic or using the Arabic language can not be used as an excuse 
or allegation to prevent the use of Arabic Language”. (Al-Ittihad, 
February 13). 

<br><br>The Lack in Arab Special Education System<br>
In our “Weekly Press Review”, No.11 we referred to the lacking 
in the system. <p>
We referred as well to Advocate Awni Banna’s petition to the 
Ministry of Education on behalf of the Association for the Right of 
the Citizen. <p>
Al-Sinnara and Al-Ittihad in there Tuesday editions reported about 
the Supreme Court decision by Judge Yakov Terkel to transform 
the petition to a form of three judges in the couple of weeks. 
Al-Ittihad Friday’s edition published a full coverage of the topic. 
Banna expressed his bitterness: “in spite the fact that 5 months 
passed since our petition to the Ministry of Education, and in spite 
the recommendation of opening new classrooms, nothing has been 
done yet”. <p>
The article review the system needs, which is missing in the Arab 
Education system such as: <br>
1. Specialist teachers. <br>
2. Special schools with special needs <br>
3. Lack of special therapy. 


<p>Autopsy files on Martyrs of “Black October” Clashes<br>
Another petition by “Adalah” – Legal center for Arab Minority 
Rights in Israel- and “The Physician Association for Human 
Rights” reflected the Arabic press in this week. 
Sawt Al-Haqq Wal-Hurriya, Al-Ittihad, Al-Sinnara, and Kull Al-
Arab (Friday 16), 
exclaimed that families of Mohammad Jabarin (Umm Al-Fahm), 
Ahmad Jabarin (Umm Al-Fahm), Rami Gharra (Jatt), and Mesleh 
Abu-Jarad (Der El-Balah),appealed to the Supreme Court in order 
to get the autopsy files from “Abu-Kabir” –the Criminal Forensic 
Institute-, which were privileged by the police.
Hassan Jabarin, a lawyer from Adalah stressed Morocco on the 
importance of this files both to families and to the Investigation 
Committee. “Refusing to supply families with this files offend their 
dignity and the Martyrs ‘ dignity as well”, Jabarin claimed in his 
petition. 
<p>
The investigation Committee starts today the testimony hearing. 
Al-Ittihad, in its Monday edition disapproves of the fact that "the 
committee did not declare the beginning of its work even to the 
martyrs' parents". 
"This make it even harder to the martyrs' advocators to get 
ready".

<p>Arab reactions to the Azur bus attack.<br>
Many Arab and Hebrew newspapers this week, chose the bus 
attack as their main topic. However just few Arab columns did 
react actually to the attack, even if it was mentioned as a topic. 

Kull Al-Arab’s front page presents the two sides of the story: The 
Azur (a town south to Tel-Aviv) bus attack and a dead teenager 
from Gaza. The headline: “Victims here and victims here, but no 
solution without an end of the occupation”.
The journalist Kaywan relates this attack to “the murdering of 
Massoad Aiad, a Palestinian officer who was murdered at the 
same day in Gaza by IDF’s helicopter”. 
<p>
Panorama relates to the same topic from the same point of view; 
the attack, background, and reactions. Sharon, the elected prime 
minister claims that “terrorist attacks do not separate between Tel-
Aviv, Holon or Hedera, but its main goal is to strike Israeli 
wherever they exist”. 
<p>
On the other hand and from a different point of view, Ayyam-Al-
Arab editorial, Mr. Walid Yassen says, “the bus attack strike our 
feelings the same as the murder of the Palestinian Officer 
Massoad Aiad, and of Mohamed Al-Durra whose murdered was 
photographed last October”.
Yassen says as well: “that he can’t bare discrimination between 
Arabic blood and Jewish blood, or tears of a Jewish mother or of 
an Arabic woman, cause this will brings both sides to more hate, 
specially if those words were President Moshe Katsav’s words. 

<p>Discriminations in Law Application<br>
Hussin Abu-Hussin in his report in Al-Ittihad Friday edition refers 
to Israeli law application especially against Israeli Arab Minority 
and Palestinians. 
Abu-Hussin stresses his point of view by giving different 
examples : "Mr. Mawtner, a researcher and lecturer in Haifa 
University concluded through his research work that chances of 
conviction an Arabic citizen by Israeli court are higher than a 
Jewish citizen; moreover, the punishment of Arabic citizen will be 
much cruel than of Jewish citizen". 
Hussin refers as well to other aspects such as law of Return, 
social discriminations such as attending public places or flying with 
Israeli flight company, where you are treated as a bomb that 
might explode any minute" 
(Al-Ittihad- February 16). 

<p>The Ribat Conference of Refuges Rights<br>
The conference, which was held in Ribat-Morocco between 10-
14 February 2001, discussed the Palestinian refuges' issue. 
A delegation of Arab organizations participate in this conference. 
The conferees explained the importance of keeping the 
Palestinians inside Israel as a main part of the refuges' problem". 
(Al-Ittihad - February 16). <p>
Advocate Khalid Zuabi, chairperson of Arab Association for 
Human Rights comment on the conference saying: "our 
participation was very important in order to strengthen our 
relations with Human Rights organizations in the Arab world". 

<p>A Meeting with an Investigation Committee - The United 
Nations.<br>
A delegation of different institutions and human rights 
organizations took a part in this meeting. 
The main discussion issues: overuse of force by police, occupation 
and its effects, property destruction and abusive arrests. 
Mohammed Zeidan- director of Arab Association for Human 
Rights stated in an interview in Al-Ittihad: "the committee work 
was limited in occupied territories since 1967, but due to the fact 
and the resemblance of "treatment" of October clashes, we 
decided to brought this issue to the committee, in order to be 
discussed". (Al-Ittihad, February 16).

<h3> <a name="pcat">Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI)</a></h3>
<b>Jehard Shuman first report </b>

<p>
*
<p>
The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) would like 
to
inform the international community of the continued detention and
possible torture of William Jehard Shuman, a British citizen, who 
was
arrested on 5.1.2001 on suspicion of being an agent of the 
Hezbollah
sent to Israel to plan and carry out terrorist attacks. 
<p>
A gag order imposed on this case was partially lifted on by the by 
the
President of the Jerusalem Magistrates Court, Judge Amnon 
Cohen on
11.2.2001.
<p>
Mr. Shuman complained to his attorney Lea Tsemel, the court and 
a
representative of the British consulate that he was tortured during
his interrogation. Among other things, he claims that he was beaten
wounded and threatened during his interrogation. An independent doctor
determined that Mr. Shuman did not receive proper medical care. 
<p>
According to the newspaper "Yediot Ahronot" who published a letter
sent by Attorney Tsemel on 27.1.2001 to the Attorney General she
stated Mr. Shuman's complaints against his interrogators and demanded
that an investigation be immediately initiated. In her letter attorney
Tsemel wrote that Mr. Shuman was not informed of his rights and told
that he had had no rights and that in Israel those interrogated must
confess to all accusations raised against them. She further stated
that Mr. Shuman complained that he was beaten, kicked, threatened and
tied for many hours to a small chair in painful positions. Because he
was not able to move after this ordeal he was sent to a hospital where
while tied to his bed he was physically abused by his guards. Mr.
Shuman also complained that he was not allowed to sleep for several
days and that when he showed signs of exhaustion a guard would take
him to the shower and pour cold water on him forcing him to sit for
hours in the cold while wet all over. Because Mr. Shuman has a history
of sinusitis he suffered as a result of the above from severe
headaches and sinus pains. Attorney Tsemel also wrote that although
Mr. Shuman knows only Arabic and English his interrogators forced him
by threatening him to sign documents written in Hebrew. He also
complained that he was threatened and verbally abused throughout his
interrogation.
<p>
According to the newspapers "Yediot Ahronot" and "Ha'Aretz", Attorney
Tsemel stated that Mr. Shuman denies all the accusations raised
against him. The newspapers also reported that the British Foreign
Office confirmed the arrest and released a strongly worded complaint
that Shuman had been mistreated by the Israeli Security services, was
not getting proper medical attention and not receiving regular visits.
The Foreign Office officials also said that an independent doctor sent
on their behalf to visit Shuman claimed that there are signs that he
underwent "physical maltreatment". These officials did not comment on
the accusations raised against Shuman but said that he should be
either charged or freed. The Israeli Foreign Ministry rejected the
complaints of the British Foreign Office stating that Mr. Shuman's
investigation had been dealt with through diplomatic channels since
his arrest and that the British authorities received all information
relevant to his arrest and a consul, doctor and lawyer have all been
allowed to visit him. 
<p>
 On 12.2.2001, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, which
 has further details but cannot publish them at this time, called on
 Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein to fully lift the gag order on
 Mr. Shuman's complaint. In PCATI's view the gag order must be lifted
 in order to carry out a fair and democratic legal process due to
 international legal standards and in order to prevent instances of
 unlawful torture. The gag order must be fully lifted so that the
 matter can come under public scrutiny and an investigation can be
 carried out to whether illegal methods were employed, and if found to
 be so also to bring those responsible to justice. 
From the ministry of justice state attorney office we were informed
that the gag order still stands.

<b>Deteriorating conditions at Megiddo Prison</b>



<p>
LAW’s lawyer Labib Habib has filed a complaint on behalf of LAW
Society with the Israeli army officer in charge of Palestinian
detainees. The complaint was pursuant to the lawyer’s visit to 
Megiddo
prison and the complaints LAW received from detainees about the
deterioration of living conditions inside the prison. In his
complaint, LAW’s lawyer described and demanded an explanation 
for the
extremely bad conditions in the prison, including insufficient and
poor quality food, inadequate healthcare, frequent electricity and
water cuts, and, since the beginning of the current Intifada,
prisoners being deprived of receiving visits from their families.
<p>
The prisoners’ representatives have complained many times about the
conditions inside the prison, especially since the spread of a
contagious skin disease that infected 20 detainees.
<p>
LAW’s lawyer also demanded immediate intervention to improve the
situation inside the prison and reiterated the texts of the
international human rights conventions in this regard.
<p>
Megiddo military prison, inside the borders of Israel, holds 800
Palestinian prisoners including 500 detainees and 15 administrative
detainees.
