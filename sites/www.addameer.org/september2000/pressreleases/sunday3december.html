The Israeli occupation continue to reinforce their presence and to 
impose restrictions on movement: Israeli forces shell Khan Yunis and 
Hebron, wounding seven</b></p>


<p>Despite a significant decrease in clashes between Palestinian 
civilians and the Israeli occupation forces in the occupied 
Palestinian territories, the Israeli occupation forces have continued 
to perpetrate serious abuses against Palestinian civilians. Near 
Al-Mentar (Karni), to the east of Gaza, this morning, the Israeli 
occupation forces wounded a 15-year-old child seriously with a live 
bullet in the chest. Yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces 
shelled Khan Yunis and Hebron, wounding a number of Palestinian 
civilians. Palestinian residential neighborhoods, adjacent to military 
posts of the Israeli occupation forces, are continuously threatened. 
Shooting and shelling have come to be a part of their daily life. In 
the past 24 hours, no change has taken place in the strict siege on 
the occupied Palestinian territories imposed by the Israeli occupation 
forces. These forces have continued to reinforce their presence at 
the main junctions and at the entrances of cities, restricting the 
movement of Palestinian civilians. The Israeli occupation forces have 
also continued to close the main road between the north and south of 
the Gaza Strip. As a result, the suffering of Palestinian civilians 
has increased and their living conditions deteriorated with the 
ongoing violation of their economic, social and cultural rights. 

<p>This morning, at about 8:00 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
shot at A’ssaf Suleiman Abu Hassan, 33 years old, from Wadi El-Salqa 
in the middle area of the Gaza Strip, wounding him with a live bullet 
in the left foot. Abu Hassan was with his children crossing the 
alternative road to Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the 
north and south of the Gaza Strip), which has been closed near Kfar 
Darom settlement. When Abu Hassan and his children approached a 
roadblock of the Israeli occupation forces established on the 
alternative road, the Israeli occupation forces shot at him. 

<p>This morning, at about 9:30 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
shot at about 20 children near Al-Mentar (Karni), to the east of Gaza 
City. As a result, the child Alla’ A’adel Abu Hujeila, 15 years old, 
from Al-Shojae’ya, was wounded with a live bullet in the chest. The 
child was evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in serious condition. 

<p>Yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces fired heavy and 
medium bullets and artillery shells at Palestinian civilians and their 
houses in the refugee camp of Khan Yunis. PCHR’s field officer 
reported that at about 22:30 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
fired heavy and medium bullets and six shells from their military 
posts in the vicinity of Al-Tuffah roadblock and Neve Dekalim 
settlement. A shell fell near a number of Palestinian civilians who 
were approximately 300 meters away from the posts of these forces. As 
a result, four Palestinian civilians were moderately to slightly 
wounded with shrapnel from the shell. They are: 1) Nedhal Mahmoud Abu 
Shammala, 30 years old, wounded with shrapnel throughout the body; 2) 
Jamal Mohammed Khalifa, 45 years old, wounded with shrapnel in the 
chest – he was transferred from Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis to 
Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City this morning; 3) Mohammed Darwish Meqdad, 
28 years old, wounded with shrapnel throughout the body; 4) Ibrahim 
Abdel-Rahman El-Trshawi, 28 years old, wounded with shrapnel 
throughout the body. 

<p>Yesterday evening, at about 18:30 local time, the Israeli occupation 
forces fired shells and heavy and medium bullets at Palestinian 
residential neighborhoods in Hebron. The shelling targeted the areas 
of Sinjar, Doberian, Al-Harayeq, Al-Zaytoon and Bab El-Zawia, and 
resulted in wounding: 1) Fayza Mustafa A’amer, 24 years old, with 
shrapnel in the head; 2) Mahmoud Mahel Fataftah, 17 years old, with a 
medium caliber bullet in the pelvis; and 3) the child Hani Mazen 
El-Joulani, 15 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the back. The 
shelling affected 12 houses, causing severe damage to walls, furniture 
and windows. 

<p>Along the road connecting Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction, to the 
south of Gaza City, and Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza 
City, the Israeli occupation forces have continued to reinforce their 
presence. Twelve tanks of these forces have been positioned in the 
area since yesterday morning. These forces have continued to close 
the mentioned road, shooting at anyone attempting to cross. PCHR’s 
field officer reported that at midday, the Israeli occupation forces 
shot at a farmer, but he was not wounded. PCHR’s field officer added 
that the Israeli occupation forces have swept large areas of land in 
the past few days and that it is difficult to reach the area due to 
security dangers. 

<p>
PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to 
immediately intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian 
civilians. PCHR calls in particular for: 

<p>1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in 
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and 
killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians. <p>2. Convening a conference of the High 
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure 
Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Convention. <p>3. 
Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the 
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces. <p>4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights.<p> 5. Providing 
humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose 
living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the 
continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
entire occupied Palestinian territories. <p>6. Use by the international 
community and relevant bodies, including ICRC, of necessary measures 
to ensure the access of medical supplies and equipment and other 
humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. The Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to deny entry of this material 
through Rafah Border Crossing (into the Gaza Strip).

ISRAELI ATTACK ON PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS ON THEIR WAY
TO THE MOSQUE
</b></p>



<p>Today, 3 December 2000, 26 Palestinians were injured at the
entrance
of the mosque in the West Bank village of Hussan near Bethlehem.
Five
of them were hit in the upper part of the body and seriously injured
by live ammunition, namely Raid Muhammad Hamarari (24), Ismat
Tareq
Ali Hamarari (16), Sabri Shoshi (27), Bilal Fahri Hamarari (19) and
Hassan Salih Ali Noufal (20). According to information collected by
LAW, a man was hit when shots were fired from a white van at
worshipers entering the Hussan mosque for 6 o’ clock prayers.
Village
residents believe that the attack was carried out by Israeli settlers.
 After the incident, confusion and unrest arouse. Israeli soldiers,
who were standing near the mosque, reacted by throwing tear gas on the
worshipers and opening fire on the crowd.

<p>Ambulances and medical personnel attempting to evacuate the injured
were hindered. This was confirmed by Peter Qumri, the director of Beit
Jala hospital, who stated that ambulances were facing serious
difficulties in reaching  the wounded. The village of Hussan has been
under closure and thus completely sealed off for a month.  At the time
of writing, clashes, which erupted after the incident, continue and
power has been cut off in Hussan and the nearby village of Nahaleen.

<p>In the village of Al Khader, also near Bethlehem, heavy machine
gunfire by the Israeli army caused damage to 10 houses and to the main
power station.

<p>At 4 p.m., the Al Ram checkpoint near Dahyat al Barid, on the
Jerusalem-Ramallah road, was closed and so were the side roads.
Palestinians on their way to the Iftar (breaking the fast) were thus
effectively prevented from reaching their homes. In some instances
harassment of Palestinians walking through the checkpoint was
reported; 2 men were detained at Al Ram checkpoint.

<p>At 6 p.m. the Israeli army launched missiles on Khan Younis in the
Gaza Strip. As a result of the attack, 4 Palestinians were reported
injured by shrapnel, namely Nidal Mahmoud Abu Shamal (30); Jamal
Muhammad Khalifa (40); Muhammad Darwish Miqdad (25) Ibrahim Abed al
Rahman al Darshawi (28).

<p>Yesterday evening, 2 December 2000, the Israeli army used
tank-missiles and heavy machine guns in Hebron. A Palestinian woman
and 3 men were reported injured: Feisa Mustafa Amro (27) was injured
by shrapnel in the head; Mahmoud Mahil Fatalfta (17) was hit by a
bullet and 15-year-old Hani Mazen al Julani was seriously injured by a
bullet in the back.  During the attack on the Hebron neighbourhoods of
Dwerban, Sanjar and Dahyat al Zeitun 12 houses were damaged.

<p>LAW is deeply concerned about the attack on peaceful Palestinian
worshipers attending the mosque who according to international
humanitarian law a high level of protection.

<p>LAW condemns the excessive use of force by the Israeli security forces
and the policy of closure as a form of collective punishment.

<p>LAW condemns the destruction of Palestinian property by the Israeli
occupying forces. The destruction of property of the occupied civilian
population, which is not of military necessity, is a violation of
international humanitarian law.

<p>LAW calls on the international community to pressure Israel to respect
the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and to implement UN
resolutions 242, 338 and 194.
