<p>"They were shooting from helicopters, tanks, soldiers, everywhere,
and
we were so afraid," explains Najib, a Palestinian boy from the town
of
Beit Jala, in a simplistic and confused manner. Marwa, an 11-year
old
girl, also from Beit Jala, paints a picture of Al-Aqsa Mosque and a
church, between them a crying boy, lifting the Palestinian flag.

<p>These images have come to haunt the children of Palestine, the
children of another world. A world in which the purity and sanctity of
childhood is replaced with fear, frustration, and uncertainty.

<p>As the daily Israeli strikes continue to grow fiercer against
Palestinian towns and villages, there is an alarming indication of a
traumatized generation. Palestinian children are being faced with the
daily horrors of Israeli gunshots, tank shells, helicopter missiles,
and most frequently, the ongoing images of killings and funerals,
whether on television or in real life.

<p>Of the 270 Palestinians killed over the past two months, almost 90 are
children below the age of 18. Of all those injured, 40% are also
children, some with critical injuries and disabilities. What impact
would that have on Marwa's innocent little world?

<p>Even indirectly, the lives of most Palestinian children have been
severely affected by Israel's ongoing siege of Palestinian towns and
villages. Many Palestinian schools have been shut down due to the
closures, and some even evacuated and turned into Israeli army posts.

<p>Palestinian children constantly see their elders humiliated, injured,
and, in many cases, killed by Israeli soldiers; they feel unprotected
and vulnerable, they feel insecure.

<p>There is an urgent need to bring all this to an "end."

<p>"Stop killing Palestinian children" (physically and emotionally) is
not merely a slogan; it is a desperate call for Israel to respect the
universality of children's rights, and the fragility of childhood.

TWO KILLED IN WEST BANK CLASHES

<p>According to information garnered by LAW, Abdel Khader Omar Jib
Abu
Khattan (22) from Dheishe refuggee camp, was killed this afternoon
during clashes in the vicinity of El khader village in the West Bank.
According to un-confirmed reports, Khattan was shot by Israeli
soldiers using live ammunition.

<p>Ramzi Adil Betnha (15)was also killed today in clashes near the
City
Inn Hotel on the outskirts of Ramallah. Betnha was fatally wounded
by
a rubber coated metal bullet. <p>The current situation demands a
particularly strong response from the international community. Despite
strong international critism in a number of international arenas,
including the United Nations Security Council, Israel continues to use
excessive lethal force in situations that do not pose an imminent
danger to soldiers. Many of those killed have been minors. The conduct
of the Israeli Military forces has been outside all the relevant legal
frameworks, from international humanitarian law to international
guidelines on the use of force for law enforcement officials. <p>LAW
calls on the High Contracting parties to the fourth Geneva Convention
to act on the convention's article 1 obligation and ensure Israel's
compliance to all relevant provisions. <p>LAW further calls for the
prosecution of those who have committed grave breaches of the
Convention. In the case of the current intifada, wilful killing.

ISRAEL SHELLS PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS in Bethlehem

INCREASING VIOLENCE BY ISRAELI SETTLERS
</b></p>


<p>
For the last two nights (December 3 and 4), the Palestinian town of
Beit Jala and the adjacent refugee camps of 'Aida and Beit Jibrin
('Azza) have been targets of massive Israeli shooting and shelling
from Israeli army positions located on the opposite hill just below
Gilo settlement and next to the entrance of 'Aida refugee camp
(Bilal
Bin Rabbah Mosque) on the main Bethlehem-Hebron road, as well
as from
Israeli gunship helicopters.<p> In the night of December 3, the Israeli
attack started at approximately 8:00 p.m. and lasted for more than
six
hours. The densely populated refugee camps were shelled with heavy
ammunition and bombs. Two LAU missiles shot from an Israeli gunship
helicopter at around 1:00 a.m. hit the home of Yahya, Omar, and Jamal
Da'ajneh in 'Aida camp destroying three floors and their car. Damages
were caused to dozens of family homes in the two camps and to the only
community center in Beit Jibrin camp. The home of Aiman al-'Azza
caught fire and was completely destroyed. Six persons were injured by
shrapnel, many elderly and children suffered from shock and anxiety
attacks. The night-time raid was preceded by an attack of Israeli
settlers, supported by the military, on the Palestinian village of
Hussan, located south-west of Bethlehem. Some 30 Palestinians
villagers were injured in this attack, seven of them seriously.
According to Israeli press reports, Israeli settlers also decided to
patrol the main Jerusalem-Hebron highway (Road No. 60), thus posing an
additional threat to the safety of Palestinian travelers.
<p>
Gilo settlement was established in the 1970s on lands confiscated from
the Palestinian town of Beit Jala following the Israeli occupation of
the West Bank in 1967. Today, the settlement houses almost 30,000
Jewish immigrants, many of them originating from the former Soviet
Union. Residents of Beit Jibrin camp (1,500) and  'Aida camp (3,500)
are Palestinian refugees evicted by Israeli forces in 1948 from their
original villages (al-Malha, al-Walaje, Beit Jibrin, a.o.) located in
the former districts of Jerusalem and Hebron. Implementation of their
right of return, restitution and compensation according to UN
Resolution 194 is one of the major issues yet to be resolved in a
future comprehensive solution of the historical Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
<p>
In the meantime, and in response to the rapidly deteriorating
situation in the 1967 occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
Municipality of Bethlehem has announced the cancellation of this
year's Christmas celebrations. Since 29 September, some 280
Palestinians have been killed and some 10,000 injured; the Palestinian
economy, especially tourism, has collapsed as a result of Israel's
repressive military and economic policies. Palestinian hopes that,
this time, the international community would intervene effectively and
enforce UN resolutions and international law in the region, are fading
rapidly. According to Israeli press reports today, the Israeli
government will reject cooperation with the US-led Commission of
Investigation, approved by the 17 October Sharem Al- Sheikh Emergency
Summit and headed by former US Senator George Mitchell, if the
Commission's mandate "is based on UN resolutions and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights." (Voice of Israel Radio, 5 December
2000).<p>

Violations
                                of Palestinians' Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights
<p>
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights this afternoon
agreed on the contents of a letter to be sent to the Government of
Israel requesting it to submit its second periodic report to the
Committee as well as additional information concerning the current
situation in the occupied Palestinian territories.

<p>The Committee noted that Israel's second periodic report, including
issues referred to and information requested by the Committee in its
concluding observations on Israel's initial report which was
considered in December 1998, should be ready for submission no later
than March 31 2001.

<p>In light of all the circumstances, including the Committee's
concluding observations and the current crisis in Israel and the
occupied Palestinian territories, the Committee decided to consider
the situation in the occupied territories in its next session with a
view to assisting the State party in conforming to its obligations
under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights. The Committee decided to discuss the situation at a meeting on
4 May 2001 in the afternoon.

<p>The Committee reminded Israel that its previous concluding
observations and recommendations had requested the submission of
additional information in time for the Committee's present session. It
acknowledged receipt of a note verbal from Israel dating 3 November
regarding this issue. Further, the Committee wished to emphasize that
some of the additional information, especially the material concerning
the occupied territories, was requested "in order to complete the
State party's initial report and thereby ensure full compliance with
its reporting obligations".


<p>The Committee said that in light of the current crisis in Israel and
the occupied territories, it was particularly unfortunate that Israel
had not provided the additional information by the time requested. In
that regard, the Committee noted the report of United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson on her recent visit to the
Middle East from 8 to 16 November 2000. The Committee said it was
deeply concerned by accounts that Israel's recent actions in the
occupied territories had resulted in the widespread and gross
violations of Palestinians' economic Social and cultural rights.

<p>Among the reports that were of grave concern to the Committee, the
following were highlighted: the Israeli military and security forces
both inside Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories had
prevented medical aid and personnel from reaching injured Palestinians
and had attacked clearly marked medical vehicles and personnel in
violation of international humanitarian law; wide spread restrictions
imposed by Israeli authorities on the movement of persons and goods,
including medicines, food and essential fuel; children travelling to
and from school had come under Israeli fire and many schools in the
occupied Palestinian territories had been forced to close; the Israeli
Defence Force had destroyed many acres of Palestinian agricultural
land in the occupied Palestinian territories; unemployment in the
territories had tripled during the crisis, causing severe economic
hardship, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups
in the population; and the incidence of house demolition and land
confiscation in the occupied Palestinian territories had increased,
including the destruction of civilian homes through the use of heavy
weapons.

<p>The Committee urged Israel to comply fully with its obligations under
the Covenant. Also this afternoon, the Committee discussed the time
interval at which States parties should submit their periodic reports.
Committee members also discussed how to improve their working methods
concerning the submission of country reports. Normally, a State party
should provide a periodic report at five-year intervals following its
ratification of the Covenant. The Committee discussed the possibility
of asking for periodic reports at shorter intervals. The States
parties whose reports were mentioned as examples were overdue by more
than five years.
<p>
When the Committee reconvenes at 10 a.m. on Friday, 1 December, it
will finalize its three-week session after having a discussion on
remaining issues.
