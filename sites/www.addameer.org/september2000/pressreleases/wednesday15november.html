<p><b>  The massacre continues: The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continue imposing siege
on
          Palestinian cities and killing Palestinian civilians
</b></p>

<p>The belligerent Israeli Occupation Army has continued to
implement the
policy aiming at isolating the Palestinian cities in the Occupied
Territories. In this context, the Israeli occupation forces have
continued to block/close the entrances of the Palestinian cities with
large cement blocks and military tanks. A curfew has been
imposed on
the old city of Hebron and Houarah village since 30/9/2000. In
addition to the closure of passages and the international airport in
the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army has continued to block Salah ad-
Din
road that connects the two halves of Gaza Strip resulting in the
deterioration of the health and economic conditions of the
Palestinian
civilians in the Occupied Territories. There is a lack of food and
drug supplies.

<p>Today, 15/11/2000, at noon, the Israeli army has opened fire on
unarmed Palestinian civilians near Almuntar crossing to the east of
Gaza. As a result, Ahmad Sameer Basal, a 20-year old resident of Tal
al-Hawa in Gaza has been killed with a bullet to the heart. In the
same incident, another Palestinian civilian, whose name is not known
till this time, has died after being shot in the right frontal area of
the head. In Rafah, an Israeli military tank has randomly opened fire
on Palestinian civilians resulting in injuring 15 of them. Fathy Oudah
Jum’ah Salim, 18-year old , and Samy Khairy Ahmad Khadhr, a 29-year
old policeman, have also been killed in Tulkarm today. The first was
shot in the chest while the latter in the head. Now, the Israeli army
is bombarding Der al-Balah near Kfar Darom Jewish settlement.
Yesterday, 15/11/2000, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces
opened fire on Palestinian civilians leading to the death of:<p> 1.
Mohammad Khatir Alijlah, a 13 year-old resident of Ashujaiah
neighborhood in Gaza who was shot in the head.<p> 2. Raid Fahmy Abu
Shaqfah, a 23 year-old resident of Rafah who was shot in the abdomen.
<p>3. Sabir Khamees Ibrash, a 15 year-old resident of Alama’ry Refugee
Camp near Ramallah who was shot in the heart. <p>4. Mostafa Mahmoud
E’lian, a 50 year-old resident of Nablus. He was beaten to death by
Jewish settlers while on the way back to Nablus from Ramallah. A very
big stone hit him in the chest fracturing his ribs which lead to his
immediate death. <p>5. Jamal Ibraheem E’lwan, a 34-year old resident of
Sanjal who died after inhaling gas fired by the Israeli army and
delaying his transfer to hospital.




<p>We, at AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights, stress again that the Israeli
siege upon the Palestinian Occupied Territories, destruction of
properties, and intentional killing of Palestinian civilians
constitute, according to the international law, war crimes. Based on
this, we stress our previous requests that the international community
should fulfill its legal obligations towards the Palestinian civilians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by providing international protection.
The non commitment to do so can only be viewed as a reward for the
crime perpetrated.

<p><b>Day 48
Israeli Forces and Settlers Continue their Assaults on Palestinians
November, 15, 2000 3:30pm GMT+2
</b></p>




<p>Throughout the West Bank and Gaza today, Israeli forces and
settlers
carried out attacks on Palestinian civilians. In Gaza, Israeli forces
fired on Palestinian demonstrators at the Al Mintar crossing.
Fifteen-year-old Ahmad Basal from the Ashuja’ieh neighborhood,
was
shot and killed by live ammunition to his chest. A second and
un-identified young man was killed by a shot to his head.

<p>In Khan Younis and Rafa, 16 Palestinians were injured, two
critically.
Ashraf Abu Dayeh, 20, from Ashate’ Refugee Camp and Ahmad Al
Mughrabi,
13, from Azaitoun neighborhood, were both shot by live ammunition
in
the neck. Israeli shelling coming from the Kfar Darom and Kosafim
settlements damaged several houses in Deir Al Balah. One home owned by
Hamdi Al Ja’farawi  was destroyed.

<p>In Hebron, the Israeli Border Police opened fire on 3 Palestinian
laborers from the village of Sourif.  Hussein Baradi was listed in
critical condition , Yousef Ghneimat was injured and his brother
Khaled Ghneimat, was detained and taken to an unknown destination.

<p>Settlers from Kharsina and Kiryat Arba settlements south of Hebron,
attacked property belonging to Naim Jaber and Abed Al Jawad Jaber.
Settlers uprooted a 4 -dunum plot planted with various crops and
confiscated irrigation pipes. According the owners, Israeli soldiers
witnessed the property destruction and did not intervene.

<p>Near Ramallah, it was reported that at 10:30 this morning, settlers
near the Nabi Saleh junction shot Sami Arar, 18, from the village of
Qarawet Bani Zeid. He was shot in both legs. Due to the Israeli
imposed closure on Ramallah, he was unable to reach the local hospital
and was instead taken via the back roads, to Rafidia hospital in
Nablus.

<p>At 3:00 this afternoon, Israeli forces shelled an empty building at
the entrance to Al Birch causing extensive damage. An exchange of fire
is continuing at this time.

<p>In Toulkarem, Israeli soldiers shot Fathi Salem, 18 and Sami Khader,
29, during a clash in the western part of Toulkarem. Both were hit by
heavy machine gun fire in the chest.

<p>Near Nablus, Israeli troops searched and ransacked a number of houses
in the Qasra village. According to residents, Israeli forces arrived
at 8 pm last night and continued their attacks on the homes until 6:00
am this morning. At least five homes were ransacked.

<p>In the Qalqilya area, Israeli forces have ransacked at least 15
properties.

<p><b>On Palestinian
Independence Day, Five More Palestinians Shot Dead by the Israeli Occupation Forces and

Al-Haq Reiterates Its Call to the International Community for International Protection for
Palestinians Under Israeli Military Occupation
</b></p>




<p> 

<p> On this day, Palestinian Independence Day, al-Haq
is appealing to the international community with a sense of urgency regarding the fate of the Palestinian people
under Israeli Military Occupation. Acts of aggression perpetrated by the Israeli Occupation Forces continue
unabated - including the excessive use of force, willful killing, arbitrary and summary execution and collective
punishment. Israeli settlers continue to conduct their rampage of violence with the support of the Israeli
Occupying Forces. Despite the unprecedented number of Israeli soldiers in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories, it appears that the Israeli Occupying Forces have made no real attempt to stop settler violence.
This indicates a double standard that is carried out by the Israeli Occupying Forces in implementing their duties
in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Palestinians live under the constant threat of terror from Israeli settlers
as a result of the Israeli Occupying Power’s failure to provide the necessary protection in accordance with its
legal commitments under international law.<p> Today five more Palestinians were killed. Jaddou’
Badiy’a Jaddou’ Abu Ikbash, 16 from Hebron/ Al-Samoa Village was shot from live ammunition to the heart by
Israeli Occupying Forces. Abdelhafez Mohammad Ghrouf, 20 from Jericho. Ahmad Sameer Basal, 20 from
Gaza. Fathi Odeh Obeid, 18, from Tulkarem Refugee Camp and Samer Sabri Ahmad Khader, 29 Palestinian
National Police from Kufr Romman/Tulkarem. <p> Yesterday, Mustafa Mahmoud I’lian, 50 from Askar Camp
near Nablus was stoned to death on the road to Nablus by Israeli settlers from Kowkab Assabah Settlement.
His son Ala’a, aged 22, and their friend Hussein Msallam, were also injured. Jamal Ibrahim Elwan 34 from
Sinjel suffocated to death as a result of tear gas on the entrance of his village (this case is still under
investigation by al-Haq fieldworkers).<p>In Gaza, Mahmoud Khater al-Ijleh, 13 was shot and killed from a live
ammunition wound to the head. Raed Fihmi Shaqfeh, 23 from Rafah was shot in the abdomen and died from his
injuries.<p> Saber Idriss, 14 from Amari Camp in Ramallah was shot in the chest by live ammunition and died.<p> Yesterday, the Israeli Occupation Forces implemented an even tighter siege on the Palestinian Occupied
Territories.<p> The lives of Palestinians living under this siege their social, economic and cultural life has
been severely obstructed, even halted. Palestinian children have been denied their right to education as the H2
area in Hebron remains under military curfew virtually imprisoning 35,000 Palestinians and denying over 12,000
Palestinian children their right to an education. Palestinians remain cut-off from primary hospitals and
health-care centers. Commercial life continues to deteriorate and the movement of goods and produce
restricted. Government Ministries are operating at a diminished capacity. Freedom of movement has been
denied to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <p>Al-Haq reiterates its call to all High Contracting
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to signal to the Israeli Occupation Authorities that it will not tolerate
grave breaches of the Convention.<p> Al-Haq urges the international community to pressure the Israeli abide by
the numerous international instruments that Israel has willingly ratified such as the International Covenant of
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms if Racial Discrimination;
the Covenant on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. In light of ongoing settler violence, and the continuing failure of the Israeli Occupying Forces to ensure
the safety of the Palestinians, al-Haq again calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva
Convention to provide and/or guarantee protection for Palestinians living under Israeli Military Occupation.

Hebrew University bans political activity 
</b></p>



<p>In a gross violation of the democratic rights of students, 
the administration of the Hebrew University has banned all 
political activity by students. This act is designed to silence 
criticism of the Israeli government's repression of the 
Palestinian uprising. 

<p>A group of Jewish and Palestinian students, including CWI members, 
organised a silent demonstration today against the ban on political 
activity. Demonstrators wore gags to protest the univerities attempts 
to silence the students. 

<p>The students who took part in this demonstration have been summoned to 
disciplinary meetings with the Dean of the university. This is a crude 
attempt to intimidate students into submission. 

<p>The denial of the right to free speach, the right to organise, and the 
right 

to demonstrate is contradicts the universities own charter which 
claims to be "committed to the values of the equality of rights and 
opportunities, to academic freedom and freedom of expression...". 

<p>The repressive methods of the university adminstration must not be 
allowed to succeed. Send messages of protest to 

<p>Avigdor Shinan, Dean of Students, 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem 
Fax: ++ 972 2 581 2738 
Email: shinan@hum.huji.ac.il 

<p>Messages of support for students to:

<p>Please send copies to us: info@maavak.org.il 

<p>UPDATE 15/11/2000 
Update on Jerusalem university administration's attack on students, 
and call for messages of protest/support. 

<p>Yesterday, 20 students demonstrated against the university 
administration's ban on political activity, including some of our 
student comrades. The ban is an attempt mainly to silence criticism by 
Palestinian students and Left Jewish students against the killing of 
13 Israeli Palestinians by Israeli police, during demonstrations 
within Israel a month ago. 

<p>Security guards who broke up the demonstration demanded the names and 
identity numbers of all students who participated. Some students 
refused to give their names. Unbeknown to the students, every student 
on the demonstration was photographed, and the pictures were handed 
over to the Dean. 

<p>That same evening, the students were summoned to individual 
disciplinary hearings by the Dean. After receiving legal advice, the 
students refused to attend the hearings, claiming that the individual 
hearings were an attempt to divide and weaken them, by isolating and 
threatening individual students. The students stressed the importance 
of waging a united struggle against the attempts at intimidation by 
the administration. 

<p>The Dean is now threatening the students with a joint disciplinary 
hearing. All students are accused of breaking the ban on political 
activity. In addition, some students are being accused of refusing to 
give their details to security guards. . The students are refusing to 
be intimidated by the university's threats, and are organizing their 
defense and struggle. 

<p>30 lecturers have already signed a petition protesting the university 
administration's intimidation of students exercising their right to 
free speech, and the students have set up committees for continuing 
the struggle, and for getting legal support. 

<p>At the start of the academic year, the Dean promised that the ban on 
political activity would only last 2 weeks. However, 2 and a half 
weeks later, the ban is still in place. 

<p>The students were very encouraged to hear that we are organizing 
international messages of protest to the Dean. 
We ask comrades, especially those with positions in student bodies or 
within universities, to send messages to the Dean, protesting the ban 
on political activity and the intimidation of students. Please also 
send messages of support to the struggling students.

Settlers' Aggressions against Palestinians</b></p>



<p>At 3AM Settlers threw a Molotov cocktail at Daoud 'Alayyan's house in 
Beit Safafa (Jerusalem area). The bottle entered a room in the house, 
causing a fire and destroying furniture. This is not the first time 
that the house has been under settler attacks; last week three 
settlers stopped their car outside the house and threw two Molotov 
cocktails at it. 

<p>About one hundred olive trees were uprooted in the village of Dair 
Netham (Ramallah) by settlers from Halameesh settlement. 

<p>During an attack by settlers, Ya'qoub Abed-Allateef Arabasi from the 
village of Jamma'een (Nablus area) was injured in his head when a 
stone was thrown at him. He was taken to Rafidya Hospital in Nablus. 

<p>Settlers from Shekadeem settlement in the north of the West Bank 
opened fire on Palestinians from the village of Toura. One villager 
was injured in his shoulder. 

<p>Fawzee Abed-al'Azeez (aged 40) was injured when a stone hit his face 
and was taken to hospital, after eight settlers attacked him and his 
wife Muyassar while they were working on their land.

<p><b>
    EIGHT PALESTINIANS KILLED TODAY</b></p>

      

              


<p>This afternoon four more Palestinians were killed by the Israeli
security forces in different towns of the West Bank. This raises the
number of Palestinians killed today in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip to eight. Among those killed, 3 were under the age of 18 and 2
just 18. Moreover, according to information gathered by LAW, 10
Palestinians were injured, among them an expectant mother.

<p>Ahmad Sha’ban (20), from Al Jalama village near Jenin, was fatally
hit
by live ammunition, which reportedly penetrated his abdomen and
exited
his back. Sha’ban was brought to Jenin hospital where he
underwent
medical surgery but his life could not be saved.

<p>In clashes at the entrance of Asamou’ village near Hebron, Munaya’ Abu
Al Kabash (16) was killed and Karim Abu Awwad (17) was seriously
injured. Al Kabash was shot in the abdomen. Abu Awwad was hit in his
left shoulder and sustained serious injuries in the main artery of his
arm; he is currently receiving treatment at Al Makassed hospital in
Jerusalem. Both youths were allegedly hit by bullets, which exploded
inside their bodies.

<p>20-year-old Abed Al Hafeth, from Jericho, was killed by live
ammunition at the southern entrance of the city.

<p>In Qalqilya, 15-year-old Ibrahim Jua’di was killed during clashes with
the Israeli security forces. Jua’di was hit in the chest by live
ammunition. According to officials of the local UNRWA clinic, he was
also hit by a dum-dum bullet, which penetrated his left kidney.

<p>Ni’meh Janem (22), a nine months pregnant woman from Fahah in the Gaza
Strip, was injured by live ammunition in her left thigh. The young
woman was not involved in any sort of violence. She was standing at a
distance of 2 kilometres from the Rafah border fence where clashes
between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli security forces were
taking place. Janem was transferred to Abu Yusef Al Najar hospital for
treatment.

<p>LAW condemns the consistent use of excessive and disproportionate
force by Israel, which is causing a large number of casualties among
Palestinian civilians, the vast majority of whom is unarmed.

<p>LAW urges the Israeli government to comply with its obligations under
the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect the civilian population of the
occupied territory and to guarantee their physical integrity and
safety. In this regard it must be noted that expectant mothers are an
especially vulnerable group, who even require a higher degree of
protection.

<p><b>
In another arbitrary action, the Israeli occupation authorities 
paralyze the work of the Palestinian Legislative Council </b></p>


<p>Arbitrary measures that have been taken by the Israeli occupation 
forces since the breakthrough of Al-Aqsa Intifada have included 
official institutions of the Palestinian national authorities, most 
notably the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). Members of the PLC 
from the Gaza Strip have been denied access to Ramallah to participate 
in the sessions of the PLC. Furthermore, PLC Members from other 
cities and villages in the West Bank have been denied access to 
Ramallah to participate in the activities of the PLC, as movement 
between these cities and villages has been restricted. 

<p>Consequently, parliamentary activities have been halted, as sessions 
of the PLC could not be convened periodically, regularly and in 
quorum. PLC Members were forced to convene separate sessions on 
October 26 and November 6, 2000 both in Ramallah and Gaza. They 
discussed the latest serious developments of the aggression launched 
by the Israeli occupation forces; particularly, use of heavy weapons, 
tanks, combat helicopters and gunboats to shell defenseless civilians 
in Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps throughout the 
occupied Palestinian territories. They also called on the 
international community to exert efforts in order to immediately 
provide international protection for the Palestinian people, and to 
establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate the 
horrible crimes perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians. 

<p>Following prolonged negotiations between the Palestinian National 
Authority and Israeli authorities after the imposition of a total 
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip on February 25, 1996, all PLC 
members were issued VIP Category 2 cards. The closure included tight 
restrictions on the movement of people, goods and vehicles between the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, including on that of PLC members traveling 
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip in order to attend the sessions 
of the PLC. These restrictions caused the postponement of sessions 
and obstructed the work of the PLC and its committees on numerous 
occasions. 

<p>According to the stipulations on the VIP Category 2 card, “the bearer 
of (the) card is a V.I.P. in the Palestinian Authority, who is 
authorized to enter Israel and the territories under the 
administration of [the] Israeli Military Government and is not 
required to obtain a personal permit …No routine searches of the 
bearer of this card or his vehicle will be conducted at the 
checkpoints …” 

<p>Despite having such VIP cards, PLC Members have not been immunized 
from arbitrary measures adopted by the Israeli occupation authorities 
against the Palestinian people since the outbreak of Al-Aqsa Intifada. 
They have been prevented from movement between the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip. As a result, the activities of the PLC and its committees 
have been halted. 

<p>PCHR reiterates its condemnation of the rampant abuses and crimes 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation authorities against Palestinian 
civilians, and asserts the following: 

<p>1. The right to free movement is a basic human right, which is ensured 
by relevant international conventions and covenants. <p>2. PCHR condemns 
measures taken by the Israeli occupation authorities preventing PLC 
Members from moving between Palestinian cities and villages in the 
West Bank, and between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Such 
measures disparage the simplest concepts of immunity and free movement 
commonly held by elected deputies. <p>3. Such measures will hinder the 
duties of the PLC in legislation, review and accountability. It is 
irrational that the main interest of PLC Members becomes how to move 
between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has been impossible in 
the past six weeks, and maybe will be so in the future.<p> 4. PCHR calls 
on world parliaments, especially the Parliament of the European Union, 
to immediately intervene to stop arbitrary measures by the Israeli 
occupation forces against PLC Members and their making of Palestinian 
legislation, and to demand the free movement of PLC Members in order 
for the PLC to exercise its duties.
