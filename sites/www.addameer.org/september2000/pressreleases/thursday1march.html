<b>AGAIN, TWO PALESTINIAN HOMES DESTROYED
AKABA VILLAGE CLINIC THREATENED</b>

 
<p>GUSH SHALOM - pob 3322, Tel-Aviv 61033 - http://www.gush-
shalom.org/

 
<p>
Last night, viewers of the Israeli Channel 1 TV News were treated to
the edifying sight of military bulldozers demolishing two Palestinian
homes at the West Bank village of Rafat. As with most of the 450
houses destroyed since the outbreak of the present Intifada, the
Palestinian inhabitants got no prior warning, and were offered 
neither
a possibility of appeal nor any compensation. 
<p>
The official explanation is "security" - i.e., that the houses might
provide cover to Palestinian guerrillas. The same rationale is offered
for the cutting down of tens of thousands of trees all over the
Occupied Territories, severely damaging the livelihood of many
Palestinian peasants and turning vast tracts to virtual deserts. It
is, in fact, the same  brutal logic which once led American generals
to defoliate the rain forests of Vietnam - and will ultimately prove
as futile.
<p>
Meanwhile, the military government's "Civil Administration" persists
in its "normal" policy of denying building permits to Palestinians
living under Israeli rule and then issuing demolition orders when
they, having no other choice,  nevertheless build on their own land. A
recent case in point is the tiny village of Akaba, in the Nablus
District. Last week, a Civil Administration officer arrived to hand
the village headman an order for the demolition of the village clinic
- a small  building, recently built to provide a minimum of medical
services to the 200 inhabitants. 
<p>
With this kind of demolition, there is at least a possibility of
appeal - though the military committees which hear such appeals are
not particularly noted for their fairness or impartiality. The case of
the Akaba clinic was taken up by Adv. Netta Amar of ACRI (Civil Rights
Association), as well as Gush Shalom, Physicians for Human Rights and 
the Committee Against House Demolitions.  
<p>
The Akaba villagers' appeal was fixed for 9:00 on Tuesday, March 13,
at the West Bank Military Headquarters in the settlement of Beit El.
An effort is being made to have as many Israelis present during these
proceedings. For transportation arrangements call Rabbi Arik Asherman
of  Rabbis for Human Rights  050-607034, 02-5637731.  
<p>
The Rabbis' group is also collecting  funds for replanting trees
uprooted or cut down by the army, and supporting the Palestinian
owners for the 6-10 years necessary for a new tree to give fruit or
for a cut tree to regenerate (for details call phone numbers above).

<b>Palestinian dies in Military Intelligence custody in Nablus</b>

<p>
In the evening of Tuesday 27 February, 30 year-old Salem Al Akra’a
from Kabalan near Nablus died at Al Watani Hospital in Nablus after
being transferred there from the town’s Military Intelligence Service
prison.
<p>
Al Akra’a’s cousin Ashraf Nofal, 27, stated to LAW that the Military
Intelligence Services had arrested Al Akra’a from a taxi rank east of
Nablus on 6 February 2001. He was held in custody and deprived 
of all
visits before being admitted to hospital five days ago.
<p>
In his statement to LAW, Ashraf added that he had seen Al Akra’a’s
body in the hospital morgue; there were signs of beating on the right
side of his head as well as sloughs in his wrists and ankles and
severe bruising on his back.
<p>
Based on the statement of Ashraf Nofal, LAW Society believes that the
deceased may have been subjected to ‘Shabeh’- shackling in a contorted
position - and beating by the Military Intelligence Services in
Nablus.
<p>
LAW Society demands the concerned parties in the PNA to form a neutral
inquiry commission to investigate the death of Al Akra’a, make the
findings of the commission public along with the autopsy results, and
bring the perpetrators, if proven that the deceased was tortured, to
justice. LAW further demands that the PNA implement the law preventing
the detention of civilians by military intelligence.

<b>LAW Weekly report 21-28 February 2001</b>
<p>
In the last week of February, Israeli forces continued to shoot at,
beat and abuse unarmed Palestinian civilians, shell Palestinian
residential areas and hold Palestinian towns and villages under 
siege.
Israeli soldiers shot dead two Palestinians and killed two others
through shelling Palestinian towns, and a woman who was five 
months
pregnant suffered a miscarriage due to tear gas inhalation.
<p>
First: Violating the right to life and security of person
<p>
1.   Deaths
<p>
·   21 year-old Ra’id Musa from Al Khader near Bethlehem died in the
afternoon of Friday 23 February after being shot in the chest from a
distance of 100 metres when Israeli soldiers broke into the western
entrance to Al Khader and opened fired at a group of Palestinian
civilians holding a peaceful protest.
<p>
·   44-year-old Mohammad Jalad was shot in the head and killed on
February 25 by Israeli soldiers stationed southwest of Tulkarem.
Eyewitness Mazin Abu Zaru (20) from Tulkarem stated to LAW that he had
seen Jalad sitting in his car talking to a bystander:
<p>
“Suddenly I heard gunfire. Jalad, who had been reversing his car, was
shot in the head and his car went into a wall. I rushed towards his
car and opened the door; a bullet hit me in the right hand and another
hit Jalad in the shoulder. The bullets were fired from a distance of
three hundred metres.”
<p>
The Israeli soldiers then also fired at the ambulance that came to
Jalad’s aid. Amar Al Jary, a paramedic for the Tulkarem Palestinian
Red Crescent Society, told LAW that he, Udai Jalad and Jamal Balayta
had gone at 7:25 pm to the place where Jalad was shot. When they
arrived, Israeli soldiers opened fire at the ambulance, hitting it
twice.
<p>
·   On February 26, 15 year-old Husam Al Disi from Samir Amees near
Jerusalem died after being shot four times with one bullet in the
chest and three in the back. Eyewitness Tha’ir Kisbah (18) from
Qalandia refugee camp told LAW that violent clashes had broken out at
9am between Palestinians and the Israeli soldiers stationed by
Jerusalem Airport. The soldiers fired teargas and rubber-coated steel
bullets at the crowd, until 2:30 pm when they began firing live
ammunition. At 3:30pm Al Disi fell on the ground, although no gunfire
was heard at that moment, and it became obvious that he had been shot
in the chest by a sniper with a silencer on his gun. He was taken to
Ramallah State Hospital but pronounced dead on arrival. On the way to
hospital, it was observed that Al Disi had also been shot three times
in the back. Tha’ir Kisbah added that he had seen Israeli
reinforcements arriving and a sniper climbing a tower approximately
one hundred metres from the place where Al Disi fell.
<p>
·   On February 27 at 9:10 pm, 53 year-old Na’em Al Kaisi from Al Balo’a
in Al Bireh died during the violent Israeli shelling of some
residential and commercial areas in the city. According to LAW’s
documentation, the shelling of Al Kaisi’s house forced his family of
13 down from the third floor to the ground floor to seek protection.
Two shells hit the second floor and began a fire, which Al Kaisi went
up to extinguish. While he was in the kitchen the soldiers fired
another shell, which directly hit Al Kaisi, blowing him into pieces.
He died instantly. Another shell hit the third floor of Al Kaisi’s
house burning the furniture and causing extensive damage.

<p>
2.   Injuries
<p>
Based on LAW’s documentation, at 4pm on Thursday 22 February clashes
between Palestinian civilians and Israeli forces broke out in the
Palestinian town of Ya’bad near Jenin. Israeli soldiers randomly fired
teargas at the houses of the village, two of which landed at the home
of Samir Hamarsha, two hundred metres from the clashes. Three of his
children; Mohammad (10), Mansour (12) and Sajida (6) suffered severe
teargas inhalation and fainted. When their mother, five months
pregnant Wafa’a Hamarsha (35), rushed to their rescue, she also
suffered teargas inhalation and fell to the ground. Hamarsha’s two
oldest daughters, Abrar (15) and Haneen (14), called an ambulance that
took Wafa’a to Jenin State Hospital. Unfortunately, doctors were
unable to save her unborn baby.
<p>
30 year-old Majida Dabour, seven months pregnant, was also wounded in
the incident, but miraculously escaped miscarriage. However, the
teargas she inhaled still causes her severe headaches, chest pains and
nausea.
<p>
In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers stationed at Al Mintar (Karney)
crossing opened fire at a group of Palestinian demonstrators in the
evening of Thursday 22 February, wounding the following people:

attached to it. When he touched it, it exploded, taking off two

<p>

Second: Shelling
<p>
In the evening of Thursday 22 February, Israeli forces stationed at
eight military outposts in the ‘Nitsar Hazatni’ settlement  south of
Rafah shelled Al Bar’a area of Deir Al Balah, which is only 400 metres
away. The shelling destroyed Deir Al Balah Vocational School, Abdullah
Iben Rawaha Basic Girls School, and the two-story house of Yusif Abu
Shamas.
<p>
On Friday, Israeli forces stationed around ‘Netsarim’ settlement
shelled Gaza’s water desalination plant 500 metres away, breaking the
pipelines and creating holes in the walls. That was the fifth time
Israeli forces have shelled the plant. Israeli soldiers stationed
opposite Saladin Gate in Rafah opened fire and shot 17 year-old Talal
Abu Areeda in the head as he stood next to his store 1,200 metres from
the Israeli military outpost. He is in a critical condition.
<p>
On Friday afternoon Israeli forces stationed at ‘Dogeet’ and ‘Ali
Sinai’ settlements west of Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip shelled two
outposts for the Palestinian National Security Forces, completely
destroying one of them and severely damaging the other.
<p>
Israeli forces in Bet El shelled the residential area north of Al
Bireh, wounding Mamoun Abu Shama in the left hand.
<p>
On Friday evening, Israeli forces in ‘Psagot’ settlement renewed the
shelling of Al Bireh. The shelling went as far as Kadura refugee camp,
wounding 15 year-old Mohammad Al Roum as he sat inside his home. The
boy is now in a critical condition.
<p>
On Tuesday February 27, Israeli forces shelled Ramallah and Al Bireh
again. Information gathered by LAW Society indicates that Israeli
forces in Bet El and the northern entrance to Al Bireh violently
shelled the area between 6:30 and 11pm. The affected areas included
the middle of Al Bireh, Al Irsal, as well as Al Baloa’a. Israeli
forces in ‘Psagot’ settlement shelled Al Jinan quarter, Al Hashimi
Street, the cemetery and the area around the Grand Park Hotel,
destroying the office of the Minister of Local Governance and the
houses of the following Palestinians:
<p>
·   Fawzi Alees (58): The shelling hit water tanks and burned the carpet<p>
·   Khamees Abu Abeed (50): The shelling destroyed the satellite dish,
water tanks and windows ·   Khalid Taleb (55): The shelling destroyed
three windows and a water tank ·   The shelling hit a block of
apartments destroying the property of Omar Al Tahan (28) and Hanan
Karoush (30).
<p>
Al Burj area in the Palestinian town of Silwad near Ramallah was
shelled at the same time from Israeli military outposts near the
area’s bypass road, damaging many houses in the town.

<p>
Third: Siege & Curfew
<p>
The Israeli policy of siege and collective punishment deprived eleven
Palestinian pilgrims from crossing the Rafah border on February 24.
The pilgrims were family members of some of those who have been killed
during the current Intifada. The Israeli forces continue to impose a
strict arbitrary military siege over the entire Palestinian
territories.
<p>
On Monday 26 February, Israeli forces in Al Almaniya quarter in Jenin
prevented two ICRC vehicles carrying food supplies to the eastern
villages of Jenin from crossing a checkpoint. The two vehicles were
traveling to the people. The Israeli soldiers reportedly held the
vehicles and the ICRC staff from 9am until 12 midday, finally, the
ICRC crew had to take a mountainous road to reach the Palestinian
villages.
<p>
Israeli forces imposed a curfew on Rafat late Tuesday night under the
pretext that the vehicles of two Israeli settlers had been shot at
from the village. The town is still under curfew.
<p>
LAW Society reiterates the following:
<p>
1.   Israeli forces are committing increased crimes and using the
Israeli war arsenal against unarmed Palestinian civilians.<p> 2.   They
continue to shell Palestinian residential areas. <p>3.   They continue to
use collective punishment against Palestinians and deprive them of
their basic human rights. <p>4.   Israeli forces use settlements as bases
from which to bomb Palestinian areas <p>5.   Israeli settlers, aided by
Israeli forces, still assault Palestinian civilians <p>6.   The
international community, its organizations, and the High Contracting
Parties of the 4th Geneva Convention have so far failed to take action
to ensure Israel’s compliance with the international resolutions and
the Convention


<p>LAW demands:

<p>1.   The Israeli government to immediately stop its crimes and
collective punishment against Palestinians.<p> 2.   An international
investigation committee to be set up, working according to UN
Resolution 1322. <p>3.   The Contracting Parties to the 4th Geneva
Convention to ensure Israel’s compliance with the Convention.
<p>4.   Palestinians to be placed under international protection. <p>5.   The
international community to put an end to these crimes and the Israeli
occupation. <p>6.   The international community to investigate the killing
of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers. The investigation shall be in
compliance with Article 146 of the 4th Geneva Convention, which
stipulates “The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any
legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions for persons
committing, or ordering to be committed, any of the grave breaches of
the present Convention…” <p>7.   The Security Council to set up an
international war crime tribunal to bring the Israeli war criminals
and those in charge of them to justice
