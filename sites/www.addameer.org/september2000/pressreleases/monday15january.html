<b>ISRAELI OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REFUSES TO
INVESTIGATE
ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE ON GROUNDS THAT IT IS NOT A
MATTER OF PUBLIC
INTEREST</b>
<p>
Yesterday, 14 January 2001, LAW learnt from the office of the
Israeli
Attorney General that an investigation into allegations of torture
brought forward by Rami Iz'oul, an 18-year-old Palestinian detainee,
would not be carried out. The reason given for the refusal to
investigate the case was that it did not constitute a matter of
"public interest". The letter by the office of the Israeli Attorney
came in response to a complaint filed by LAW, through its attorney
Labib Habib, with the Department for Investigation of Police
Misconduct on 3 December 2000. LAW had demanded an
investigation into
the interrogation of Rami Iz'oul.
<p>
Rami Iz'oul was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his home in the West
Bank village of Husan near Bethlehem on 30 October 2000 and has been
kept in detention since. Iz'oul claims that he was beaten and had
ice-cold water poured over his head during the interrogation by the
Israeli police (see LAW's press releases of 30 November and 16
December 2000).
<p>
Due to the torture suffered during interrogation, Iz'oul had to be
transferred to Hadassa hospital in Jerusalem and was hospitalized for
one night. After his release from hospital, the 18-year-old reported
that he was beaten again and threatened into signing a false
confession.
<p>
On 6 September 1999, the Israeli High Court issued a judgment
outlawing specific interrogation methods amounting to torture. The
High Court further stated that a reasonable interrogation was
necessarily one free of torture, cruel and inhuman treatment. The
Court highlighted that "brutal and inhuman means" were prohibited
during interrogation and that human dignity includes the dignity of
the suspect being interrogated.

<p>LAW believes that the practices used during the interrogation of Rami
Iz'oul amount to "brutal and inhuman means" and are therefore in
contradiction of the High Court ruling of 6 September 1999.

<p>For this reason, LAW maintains that an investigation into the
allegations of torture brought forward by Rami Iz'oul is of the utmost
importance and will further pursue the issue with the Israeli State
Prosecutor's Office. LAW is concerned that if a proper investigation
into the case is not carried out, it will be seen by Israeli
interrogators as a signal that acts of torture and ill treatment will
go unpunished.

<p>Under international law, interrogation methods which constitute
torture or ill treatment are absolutely prohibited and subject to
universal jurisdiction.

Adalah: The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel </a></h3>
<b>Israeli Court Approves Administrative Detention of Palestinian Citizen 
of Israel</b>

 

 
<br><br>
The President of the District Court of Nazareth, Justice Yehuda 
Abramovich, yesterday approved a six-month administrative detention 
order against Mr. Ghassan Athamleh. The order, issued on 4 December 
2000 by Prime Minister And Minister of Defense Ehud Barak, is the 
first such administrative detention order to be issued against an Arab 
Palestinian citizen of Israel since 1997. The Court's decision was 
based on 'secret evidence,' presented to the Court by the State's 
prosecuting attorney, Ms. Esther Gofer and the General Security 
Services (GSS) ('Shin Beit'). Neither Mr. Athamleh nor his defense 
team was allowed to see the secret evidence or respond to it. 
<br><br>
Mr. Athamleh was detained on 21 November 2000 and subjected to GSS 
investigation for ten days before the Defense Minister issued an 
administrative detention order. During this period, Mr. Athamleh was 
held in 'incommunicado detention,' not permitted to meet with his 
lawyers or family members. The Emergency Powers (Detention) Law (1979) 
authorizes the government to order the administrative detention of 
individuals for up to a six-month period, which may then be renewed 
repeatedly. 
<br><br>
Mr. Athamleh lives in Reineh village in the Galilee (near Nazareth). 
He is 38 years old, and is married with four children. He is a 
political activist and a Central Committee member of the Balad party 
(National Democratic Alliance). Mr. Athamleh was administratively 
detained on two prior occasions, once in 1988 and once in 1995. He is 
being held in the Kishon "Jalamee" prison in isolation, denied contact 
with the other detainees and forced to remain in his cell 23 hours per 
day. 
<br><br>
Adalah lawyers, Mr. Hassan Jabareen (General Director) and Mr. Jamil 
Dakwar, represent Mr. Athamleh. They argued that administrative 
detention severely violates Mr. Athamleh's due process rights, in 
clear contradiction with the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom 
(1992), which provides for the right To liberty and the right to 
dignity. If the State believes that Mr. Athamleh committed offenses, 
the State should initiate a criminal prosecution and submit an 
indictment, which informs Mr. Athamleh and his lawyers of the charges 
against him and allows them to challenge the State's allegations. They 
also charged that Mr. Athamleh's detention was politically motivated. 

<p>Justice Abramovich rejected the argument that the goal of issuing the 
order against Mr. Athamleh was to stop his political activity. He 
found that there isn't and wasn't 'even the shadow of a shadow of any 
political act' in the Defense Minister's issuance of the detention 
order. Justice Abramovich also stated that the initiation of a 
criminal prosecution was impossible due to the State's need to protect 
its sources, as well as the methods used to obtain such information. 
Justice Abramovich agreed that the State Prosecutor could not allege 
facts sufficient to criminally charge and detain Mr. Athamleh, and 
that alternative measures - such as house arrest or other restrictions 
on movement - would be insufficient to ensure against Mr. Athamleh's 
dangerous activities. Adalah will appeal this decision to the Supreme 
Court.

<b>Israeli Settlers Attack Palestinian Civilians and their Properties in 
Khan Younis </b>

<p>
In one of the most recent attacks, perpetrated by Israeli forces and 
settlers against Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, 
more than 150 settlers attacked the Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area West 
of Khan Younis. The area is under Israeli military control. They set 
fire to a number of houses and civilians buildings. 
<p>
According to eyewitnesses, at about 12:30 this afternoon, 150 armed 
settlers from the settlements of Kfar Yam, Netzer Hazani, and Neve 
Dekalim under full protection from Israeli soldiers attacked and set 
fire to six beach front coffee shops owned by Palestinians from Khan 
Younis. Two houses, belonging to Ibrahim Yousef Al-Laham, and Said 
Abdulla Al-Najar, were burned down. Settlers also burned a cattle 
barn, and many green houses owned by Palestinian civilians. Much 
agricultural land was also destroyed by settlers in the attack. The 
settlers fired guns in the air intimidating local residents and 
forcing them to remain in their homes. The attack lasted until 2:00 
pm, when Israeli soldiers intervened and forced the settlers to leave. 
Because the Israeli Occupation forces have closed the area PCHR has 
not been able to gather further informaion about this attack. 

<p>Last night and early this morning Israeli occupation forces brought 
more forces into the Al-Mawasi area. Palestinian houses were 
searched. Sabri Said Al-Najar (the son of Said Al-Najar) was 
arrested. Civilians were forced to stay in their homes due to an 
unofficial curfew. The two main roads leading from Khan Younis and 
Rafah to the Al-Mawasi area were closed by Israeli forces (the 
crossings at Al-Tufah and Tel-Sultan). In additional all of the 
smaller roads leading to the area were blocked by Israeli occupation 
forces. 

<p>PCHR calls upon the international community to intervene immediately 
to stop the grave human rights violations perpetrated by Israeli 
forces and settlers against Palestinian civilians. PCHR reiterates 
its demand that the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention of 1949 take effective measures to ensure the 
implementation of the agreement by Israel in the Occupied Territories, 
and to live up to their own obligations, by providing protection for 
Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Territories.
