stress our previous requests that the international community should
immediately intervene to stop the Israeli massacres against the
Palestinian civilians and provide international protection for them.
We also call upon the regional and international organizations,
especially those concerned with the human rights aspect, to exert
pressure on their governments in order to punish the Israeli war
criminals.

<h3>LAW</h3>

<p><b> Day 51<br>
Israeli Forces Continue Repression of Palestinians
</b></p>



<p>In an effort to further restrict Palestinian movement, the Israeli
military tightened the internal closure around West Bank cities and
in
Gaza, the Israeli forces continue to block off the northern part of
the strip from the southern part. Palestinian land also continues to
come under attack by Israeli bulldozers.

<p>Israeli forces in the West Bank used bulldozers to close off several
side roads used by Palestinians to get to and from work, reach
essential services and visit family.

<p>Closure is also still in force on the villages of Sinjil near
Ramallah, and Baka Al -Sharkiyeh near Tulkarem. Israeli soldiers
arrested five young men from Baka Al-Sharkiyeh, Mahmoud
Mohammed Sadik
Salid, Omar Sukaila Majadala, Ayman Majed Al Musaed and Ahmad Mohammed
Khaled Odeh.

<p>At 1:30 pm this afternoon, Israeli forces stationed at Beit Hadassah
and on the hills overlooking Hebron fired heavy machine guns at
Palestinian demonstrators. On the border between Israeli occupied H2
and Palestinian controlled Hebron, Israeli forces injured 8
Palestinians. Three were hit with live ammunition and 5 with rubber
coated metal bullets.

<p>For the 51st consecutive day the, Israeli military continued its
24-hour curfew on the Israeli Occupied H2 area of Hebron, confining
approximately 40,000 Palestinians to “ house arrest.”

<p>In Jenin, 5 Palestinians were taken to the Jenin Governmental Hospital
with injuries sustained during clashes.  Four men are from Jaba near
Jenin. Two of them, Ali Saleh Ibrahim Alouna, 23, and Mohammed Mansour
Jarrar, 25, sustained injuries to their legs. Rubber-coated metal
bullets hit two other unidentified men. A fifth man, Subhay Hamad
Kabaha, 50 from the village of Tura Al Gharbiyeh was beaten
unconscious by Israeli forces as he tried to stop them from entering
his village.

<p>Also in Tura, Israeli bulldozers uprooted 16 olive trees and levelled
8 dunums of land owned by Mustafa Abdel Jabbar, and Sami Azeid.
Israeli bulldozers also dug a 3-meter deep trench across the road
leading to the village, preventing the villagers from leaving or
entering.

<p>Last night in Gaza, Israeli military bulldozers levelled both sides of
the road between the Mintar Crossing and the Al Shuhada Junction.
Fifty dunums planted with olive trees belonging to the El Ja’arzin, El
Showwa, El Gharabli, Dahduh, Abu Arja and Hajjaj families were also
levelled.

<p>Two brick factories owned by Mospah Kashko and Mohammed Yousef Malkeh
were completely demolished by the Israeli forces. The estimated value
for each factory is  $95,000. A garage and two cars owned by Malkeh
were also destroyed. LAW continues to demand that the international
community ensure that the Government of Israel complies with the
provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention, aimed at safeguarding the
rights of protected persons in situations of belligerent occupation.
LAW further demands the immediate implementation of all UN resolutions
concerning the conflict, and for international protection for the
Palestinian people in the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and the
Gaza Strip.
