Five More Palestinian Civilians Summarily Executed by Israeli Forces</b></p>
<p>


Last night Israeli Forces killed five Palestinian civilians in an ambush near Qalqilya.<p> The bodies of Qosay Faisal Zahran, aged 22, Mahmoud Yousef al-Abel, aged 30, Mohammad Mansour Adwan, aged 18, Ziad Ghaleb Salmi, aged 22, and Mahid Qasim Jaber, aged 17, were discovered at 6:00am this morning.<p> An Israeli Army spokesman alleged that the men killed were members of the Fateh movement, but local Fatah officials deny that the men were connected to the organization.<p> The Israeli government has declared all Fatah Intifada Leaders legitimate targets and has executed a number of individuals over the last month.<p> The bodies of the men were found 150 to 200 meters from each other in a field approximately three kilometers from the Israeli settlement “Alfe Manashe”, in the southeast region of Qalqilya.<p> It has been reported that three helicopter gunships and foot soldiers were used in carrying out the killings.<p> Al-Haq fieldworkers are conducting an investigation into the incident.<p> Willful killing constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as defined by Article 147.<p> Article 146 imposes an obligation on the States Parties to the Convention, especially those who have incorporated it into their domestic legislation (as the Government of Israel continues to conduct itself in a manner totally in disregard of international humanitarian law and international human rights principles) to search for and prosecute in their domestic courts those who commit or order committed grave breaches of the Convention.<p> Therefore, al-Haq calls upon the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to fulfill its legal obligations by calling upon High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to reconvene the conference in order to decide on effective measures to pressure the Israeli government to abide by its obligations under the Conventions and in order to stop summary and arbitrary executions of Palestinian civilians, lift the siege of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, halt the excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians, collective punishment and other grave breaches.<p> Al-Haq urges the international community to send an international protection force to ensure the safety and security of Palestinian civilians as previous experience has proven that a monitoring force is not able to protect Palestinian civilians from continuing grave breaches committed by the Israeli military forces.

SECRETARY-GENERAL'S MESSAGE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE </b></p>




<p>Following the text of the Secretary-General's message on the occasion 
of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, 
commemorated on 29 November: 

<p>On this important day, I am pleased to convey my greetings to the 
Palestinian people and to all who strive for a comprehensive, just and 
lasting settlement of the question of Palestine. I wish to also 
express my deepest sympathies to the bereaved families of those killed 
and wounded in the violence of the past two months. I pledge to seek 
an end to the violence and a restoration of trust between the parties 
with all the means and resources at my command. 

<p>This year's day of solidarity with the Palestinian people falls at a 
very sensitive and difficult time. During the past year, the parties 
have continued to make a determined effort to overcome decades of 
suspicion and animosity in order to build bridges of reconciliation 
and partnership. Regrettably, following the September events in East 
Jerusalem, the situation on the ground began to escalate, rapidly 
reaching crisis proportions and putting on hold the prospects of 
further negotiations. 

<p>As the situation deteriorated, I appealed to the leadership of the two 
sides to refrain from making emotional public statements, and to weigh 
their words with great care. The same should apply to the wider 
international community. We all should do our best to assist the 
Palestinians and the Israelis in their truly historic quest for peace. 
I would like to seize this opportunity to call upon the parties once 
again to preserve the achievements of the past nine years and to move 
steadily ahead along the path of peace and reconciliation. 

<p>The worsening of the situation on the ground in the past few weeks has 
had an extremely damaging effect on the Palestinian economy. As a 
result of the conflict, the unemployment and poverty rates have risen 
considerably after several years of improvement. There is a growing 
sense of despair, frustration and anger among Palestinians. This is 
why it is essential to restore calm as soon as possible, and to revive 
the peace negotiations in order also to restart the economy. 

<p>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the full commitment of the 
United Nations to supporting the parties through the peace process. I 
can also assure you that the United Nations will continue to provide 
the assistance to the Palestinian people until a comprehensive, just 
and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine is achieved, and 
peace and prosperity at last prevail in the Middle East.

Settlers' aggression against Palestinians 
Daily report </b></p>


<p>-Settlers from Qiryat Sefer used big rocks to block the way linking 
villages in the Ramallah area to villages in the west, forcing 
Palestinians to use the long routes. 

<p>-Settlers from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip burned a house belonging 
to Abed al-Mu'tee Abu-Ghayyada, while other settlers opened fire on 
Waheed Thabet's house in the Aldeek section. They then prevented 
ambulances from reaching the houses.
