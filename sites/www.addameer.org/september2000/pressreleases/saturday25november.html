                                  continues to cause casualties</b></p>
<p>Last night, the 24 November 2000, Sami and Nahed Amer were
killed by
Israeli tank fire in the village of Kufur Qalil. The two killed were
brothers. According to reports, there was an exchange  of fire
between
the Israeli security forces and armed Palestinians in the vicinity of
the village. The brothers were apparently killed during the exchange
of fire. Sami Amer (32) was married with 3 children and his brother
Nahed (26) was also married and was the father of 2 children.
During
the shelling, 5 residents of Kufur Qalil were also injured. Juhad Amer
(18) was injured in the head and right arm by shrapnel. Ghada Amer,
Nasser Sayel, Mahmoud Ghazawi and Hasan Amer also sustained injuries
as a result of Israeli tank fire.

<p>In Gaza, Eyad Abu Jazar (21) from Rafah was shot and killed yesterday
evening while standing outside his home. Jazar's home was
approximately 150 meters from the Salah al Din Gate which has been a
familiar flash point. Jazar was physically and mentally handicapped.

<p>As the daily toll of deaths continue, with the vast majority of those
killed being unarmed civilians, the urgency of the situation
increases. The Israeli security forces have been responsible for the
use of excessive, indiscriminate and lethal force, which has been
condemned by international human rights organisations such as Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch. The United Nations Security
Council in its resolution 1322 of the 7 October 2000 condemned
"Israel's use of excessive force against Palestinians resulting in
injury and loss of life". Many of the acts carried out by the Israeli
security forces may well be war crimes. The killing of unarmed
civilians in a deliberate manner in circumstances where they do not
pose an imminent threat to the life of soldiers is wilful killing.
Wilful Killing is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and
is subject to prosecution under the principle of universal
jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is particularly heinous to fire upon
targets in civilian areas, which the Israeli security forces did in
the case of the Kufur Qalil killings. International humanitarian law,
of which the Fourth Geneva Convention is an integral part, is intended
to safe guard the interests of the civilian population in times of
belligerency and occupation, and prohibits attacks on places of
civilian habitation.

<p>LAW condemns, unreservedly, the violation of the right to life.

<p>LAW strongly urges the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva
Convention to ensure Israel's respect of all its relevant provisions.

<p>LAW calls upon the United Nations Security Council to act upon
resolution 242 and 338 in order to ensure Israel's compliance with its
stipulations concerning the inadmissibility of the acquisition of
Territory by force. LAW also calls upon the world body to ensure
Israel's compliance with resolution 194, (the right of return and
compensation of the Palestinian refugees).

<h3>ICCP</h3>

<p><b>November 29 - International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People <br>
United Nations 
New York </b></p>



<p>Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, 

<p>We are gathered for this solemn meeting in the House of Peace at a 
moment of unparalleled peril for the Palestinian people. In my 
capacity as the chairman 

of the ICCP, I have had the honor of representing the world's network 
of NGOs actively committed to the question of Palestine at this 
honorable event on several occasions since 1982. I have heard 
eloquent appeals for solidarity 

with the people of Palestine for many years. But rarely has there 
been a time in the struggle for Palestinian individual and national 
rights when the costs have been so grave. At this time, international 
protection for the 

Palestinian nation must be on the daily agenda of the United Nations 
and on the priority list of every member state committed to peace and 
justice in the Middle East. Survival of the people may literally 
depend on the clear, 

focused attention of the world's states and the gathering place they 
have 

created, the United Nations. 

<p>Each day the world's media reports the grim and steadily increasing 
number of dead and wounded in occupied Palestine. Each day the toll 
rises in both 

columns. Each day the antiseptic press admits that "most of those 
killed or wounded are Palestinian". In this chamber and among NGOs 
dedicated to support the creation of the state of Palestine, the harsh 
realities of such reporting 

are written in the names, ages and description of the injuries that 
Palestinians are suffering each day. Many Americans think that the 
daily 

clashes that have become almost monotonous to most of them are 
occurring in Israel. The fact of the occupation is now lost on a world 
preoccupied with a thousand distractions including monitoring the 
world's global financial 

markets. The issue of Palestine and peace in the Middle East is not 
foremost 

in the global public's mind. The raw and protracted injustice of this 

reality does not command the sustained interest of a 
cyber-preoccupied, 

self-indulgent world. 

<p>First and foremost, the immediate issue before us must be saving 
lives, so that parents and their children may actually be able to live 
that peace all of us daily dream of, and strive for,in thought, word 
and deed. Today peace is an orphan, almost a myth among the reports of 
gunships destroying buildings, reports that it is the Palestinians who 
have Israel under siege, 

and the inexorable daily tally of the dead and wounded, most of them 
young 

and disfigured for life. The scars of this national, sustained cry for 

independence and for assistance are indelibly written on the faces and 
maimed bodies of children of Palestine. 

<p>NGO's have been speaking, writing, gathering, lobbying and 
demonstrating 

about the impact of this injustice, and proclaiming their support for 
UN resolutions on peace and justice in the Middle East for many years. 
There has been a close association between the NGO movement and the UN 
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian 
People since the 1983 UN International Conference on the Question of 
Palestine. NGOs have assumed 

increasingly relevant roles on international issues and the work of 
the UN. The Secretary General reminded us earlier this year that it 
is in collaboration among nation-states, international organizations 
and NGOs that an effective, active coalition can be assembled to 
tackle the problems of the planet that eclipse the ability of any one 
actor to satisfactorily resolve. 

<p>NGOs remain unswervingly committed to the United Nations and its 
relevant 

resolutions as the only effective pathway to peace. The collapse of 
the peace process,which conspicuously bypassed the UN, clearly 
confirms the accuracy of this NGO vision. One nation alone, even a 
superpower, can produce this peace between the parties when its 
policies and relations are consistently and 

overwhelmingly biased in favor of one party. 

<p>The NGO network firmly believes that it is time to return to the 
United 

Nations as epicenter of any international search for peace, and for 
the UN to step forward and fulfill the convener role. Any serious path 
to peace has been directly or indirectly connected to Resolution 242 
and to the UN. 
It is 
time to return this global organization to its rightful place at the 
center 

of new resolve. And there is not a moment to spare. Though it is 26 
years old, the land for peace formula squarely addresses the 
illegality of protracted occupation and reminds us that, despite 
sophistry to the contrary, 

whole sections of international law, the law of responsible nations, 
squarely 

apply to the question of Palestine. 

<p>This is Day ___ of the new intifada and the number of dead and wounded 
will increase at the expense of Palestinian youth and their mourning 
families. 

<p>For many NGOs this stark reality means that genuine progress to end 
the 

confrontation by seeking a real and workable peace must emerge as the 
top priority of the UN and each of its members each and every day. 
And for every member state there are numerous non-governmental 
organizations in all parts of the world actively striving to produce 
that result. 

<p>Bring the quest for peace back to this House dedicated from its 
inception to the pursuit and maintenance of peace. NGOs are eager to 
assist in mobilizing 

civil societies to demand support from their governments for such an 
initiative. Since 1982 and the UN Conference on Palestine, NGOs, as an 

emerging network, have toiled as civil partners of the United Nations 
in championing the rights of the Palestinian people. The securing of 
the right to a state with East Jerusalem as its capital, the right to 
return, the right to freedom from want and fear, and the right to live 
a normal life, is the common bond that links NGOs to one another and 
to this international organization. 

<p>It is time to introduce a new generation to international law, to 
Resolution 

242, and to a United Nations striding into a new era with confidence 
and 

competence. The fate of the Palestinian people is the issue before us. 

<p>Respectfully submitted, 

<p>Don Betz<br> 
Chair, ICCP <br>
International Coordinating Committee <br>
for NGOs on the Question of Palestine

                           ISRAEL’S USE OF HEAVY ARTILLERY
CLAIMS 4
                           LIVES</b></p>

                          

<p>Today, the 25 November 2000, four Palestinians were killed by the
Israeli security forces.

<p>During clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
security
forces at the Al Jalami checkpoint in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers
entered agricultural land south of Al Jalami village where Amjad
Abadi
(21) from Jenin and Bashar Samoudi (17) from Al Yamon were
working.
The Israeli soldiers fired four bullets into the direction of the two
Palestinians. Abadi was hit in the stomach by live ammunition.  He
died in Jenin Hospital shortly after the incident. Samoudi was shot in
the chest and is reported to be in serious condition.

<p>At 5 p.m. this afternoon, 17-year old Abad Az-Aden from Araba village
near Jenin was killed during clashes at the entrance of the village
close to the Israeli army base of Dotan. Az-Aden was reportedly shot
by a bullet which entered his mouth and exited through his head.

<p>In Nablus, Fouad ‘Adnan Doweikat (27), an administrative employee of
the Palestinian Ministry of Health, from Balata village, was hit and
killed in the back by live ammunition on the Nablus-Jerusalem road. In
the same incident, Israeli security forces injured three more
Palestinian civilians. Fadi Mohammad Aouda (18) from Tamoun was hit in
the back by live ammunition and severely injured. Amjad Hussein (18)
from Balata refugee camp and Atif Yusef Hamaisha (26) from Beit Djan
were both hit in the left leg.

<p>In the Gaza Strip Israeli security forces fired two missiles at a
grocery shop located at a distance of 250 meters from the Tufah
checkpoint. According to information collected by LAW, Israeli forces
fired two missiles aimed at Palestinian demonstrators hiding behind
the shop. The missiles hit the grocery shop and killed Taisar Adnan
Hamad Abu Araj (18) from Khan Younis. At the time of the attack Araj
was standing inside of the grocery shop. Moreover, at the same
location, Israeli security forces attacked an ambulance of the
Palestinian Ministry of Health. Both the driver of the ambulance, Awni
Al Agha (40) from Khan Younis, and paramedic Sami Namus (35) suffered
injuries from shrapnel.

<p><b>Settler Attack in the Beqa'a</b></p>
 
<p>By Bourke Kennedy 

<p>As dusk settled over the Palestinian fields and homes in the Beqa'a 
Valley, men in kippahs began to gather at the intersection of route 60 
and the road leading to Givat Ha Harsina settlement. White cars 
parked on the settlement road. Women with small children in their 
arms, pre-teen boys and girls, teenaged boys and men carrying M- 16s 
continued to swell the settler ranks to around 100 people. 

<p>They lit two bonfires on Route 60 opposite the settler road. There 
was singing and chanting-a family outing atmosphere. Suddenly, a cry 
went up and the young people dashed up the street and began throwing 
stones at a couple of approaching Palestinian cars. 

<p>Two Israeli police jeeps drove after the group. A loudspeaker called 
them to desist. Some of the mob began throwing stones at a house near 
the road. Another cry went up and the mob started running down route 
60 in the opposite direction. Four army jeeps joined the police vans 
in trying to keep the settlers on the road. About three dozen settler 
youth climbed over the guard rails and began breaking off sprinkler 
heads and cutting irrigation pipes in the surrounding vineyards. They 
threw what they had pulled up into the bonfires. They then set a 
bonfire in the vineyards and the mob cheered. 

<p>Two hours later, most of the settlers had gathered near the Kiryat 
Arba road. Police and army vehicles began a "round up" and slowly 
drove the settlers back --women, children, people on bikes, people 
with M-16s, some singing, some laughing, some chanting--to the 
intersection where they began their ascent to their homes on the Givat 
Ha Harsina hill.

<h3>SHAMS TV Consortium</h3>

<p><b>Emergency Appeal from Private Palestinian Television Stations</b></p>

<p>
Ever since the current conflict began, local Palestinian television
stations have been in the forefront in carrying a major brunt of the
burden of communicating what is happening to the Palestinian
public.

<p>At a time when major television stations were busy covering the
story
as a news event, local Palestinian TV stations were busy providing
up
to date news of what is happening in their own community as well
as a
wide assortment of counseling and other community related
programming.
The service provided by local Palestinian television stations has
been
credited by many as a major source of encouragement and moral
support
at a time of deep trauma. People felt at ease knowing what was
happening and where as well as how to get help and advice.  A survey
conducted by Bir Zeit University showed that Palestinian media
received 80% approval rating from the Palestinian public.

<p> This has not been easy, though. Our stations and crews have been shot
 at, shelled, threatened and forced off the air. Our vidoe cameras
 have been destroyed, many nights our crew had to sleep in when
 getting home was impossible. In Jenin, Farah Tv was shelled. In
 Ramalla Wattan TV was forced off the air shortly after Israel
 threatened to bomb them. Even the home of the owner of one of our
 stations in Bethlehem was devastated by an Israeli missile.
 Nevertheless we have continued broadcast in order to keep our people
 informed.

<p> Local Palestinian television stations, however, are now facing dire
 straits. As private non governmental stations, these stations depend
 solely on advertisement and program sponsorship. This crucial source
 of income has all but disappeared in the past six weeks as the
 Palestinian economy has come to a standstill. The economic pressure
 has caused the closure or major curtailment of programming for a
 number of local television stations.

 <p>SHAMS, a consortium of seven  television stations covering major West
 Bank and Gaza cities, has been working hard during these times to
 stay afloat. We have done that by cooperating between our stations
 and by exchanging programs. The continuation of the difficult
 situation is endangering our consortium despite our efforts at
 cooperation and sharing our resources.

 <p>The stations included in the Shams consortuim are:

 <p>Farah TV (Jenin), Nablus TV, Wattan TV (Ramallah), Al Quds
 Educational Television (Jerusalem), Bethlehem TV, Majd TV (Hebron),
 and Ramattan TV (Gaza)

 <p>While we normally prefer to be self reliant, depending on
 advertisement income for our survival, the present situation is
 threatening our very existence as truly democratic and independent
 voices in Palestine.

 <p>We are therefore sending out this emergency appeal for help with the
 hope it will find listening ears.  Our needs can be summarized as
 follows:

           <p>1. Direct financial support to cover the salaries of our staff
           or to sponsor programs and spots.

<p>2. Support in replacing our equipment (Super VHS or Digital Cameras and
editing equipment)

<p>3.                  Video tapes

<p>4.                  Protective gear for our camera persons (helmets
and bulletproof vests).

 <p>Your support is crucial to keep this free and democratic voice alive
 in Palestine. You can support us directly by contacting the rotating
 chairman of Shams consortuim, Mr. Tareq Kayyal of Majd TV in Hebron
 at majdtv@hebronet.com. You can call Majd TV at 00972 2 2225458

<p>If you wish you can contact us through the Danish partners INROADS who
have taken a lead role in supporting the Shams consortium long before
the latest events. Mr. Christan Jessen is the Inroads coordinator in
Jerusalem. You can contact him by email at Jessen@inroads.net.

 <p>You can also contact me at 00 972 2 2959274 or by email at
