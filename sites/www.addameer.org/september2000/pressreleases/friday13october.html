Investigation into Alleged Abuses</font></h3>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> 
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br>
  October 13, 2000 
<p>(Washington, DC) -- Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) today activated its membership 
  to call for an independent international investigation by the United Nations 
  into the serious human rights abuses in Israel and the Occupied Territories, 
  including the areas under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, and 
  urged the US government to support such a call. 
<p>"It is the responsibility of both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to 
  respect and maintain the rule of law, which includes the protection of human 
  life and safety at all times," said William F. Schulz, AIUSA Executive Director. 
<p> Amnesty International members in the US are writing to Secretary of State 
  Madeleine Albright urging that she support an independent and impartial international 
  investigation, which should report to the Commission on Human Rights, the General 
  Assembly and the Security Council. The authorities concerned should be obliged 
  to cooperate with such an investigation. 
<p>"There should be no impunity for individuals who carry out unlawful killings 
  and other human rights abuses, which both Palestinians and Israelis have fallen 
  victim to in the last two weeks," said Schulz. 
<p>Amnesty International condemned the torture and killings of the Israeli soldiers 
  in Ramallah/al-Bireh yesterday, and called on the Palestinian Authority to ensure 
  that the killings are promptly and thoroughly investigated and that the perpetrators 
  are brought to justice in trials that meet international standards. 
<p>Amnesty International also condemned the punitive attacks on Palestinian facilities 
  carried out by Israeli forces yesterday in the wake of the killings, and which 
  resulted in the injury of at least 25 people. 
<p>Over the last two weeks the organization has consistently condemned the excessive 
  and extensive use of lethal force in situations where lives were not at imminent 
  risk, and which has resulted in the deaths of about 100 people. 
<p>Amnesty International reiterates its call for a United Nations investigative 
  team. This investigative team should be independent and include criminal justice 
  and other experts known for their impartiality and integrity, and should investigate 
  all serious human rights abuses that took place since September 29th in Israel, 
  the Occupied Territories and south Lebanon.

<b>DCI/PS VIEWS WITH GRAVE CONCERN THE EXCESSIVE AND DISPROPORTIONATE USE OF FORCE 
BY THE ISRAELI MILITARY</b> 
<p>For immediate release 13 October 2000 
<p>DCI/PS views with grave concern yesterday's excessive and disproportionate 
  Israeli attack on Palestinian civilian areas. In the past 24 hours, the world 
  has watched as Israeli military forces launched an unprecedented missile attack 
  on Palestinian cities throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, leading to a 
  further escalation in the ongoing confrontations between Palestinian protestors 
  and the Israeli occupation authorities. Beginning yesterday afternoon and continuing 
  through the evening, Israeli helicopter gunships fired numerous missiles into 
  the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Gaza. In addition, Israeli helicopter 
  gunships hit locations in Hebron, Salfit, and Jericho, in the West Bank, with 
  missiles and ammunition. The attack, which Israeli Prime Minister and Minister 
  of Defence Ehud Barak justified as retaliation for the killing of two Israeli 
  soldiers in Ramallah yesterday, targeted locations in densely populated residential 
  and commercial centers. Over 25 people were injured in the attack, including 
  4 Palestinian children. Palestinian homes and businesses surrounding the areas 
  targeted in the attack suffered damage, including shattered windows and structural 
  damage. Moreover, Palestinian residents, in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
  experienced power outages throughout the evening. 
<p>Yesterday's attack was the latest show of force in what has been an ongoing 
  siege against the Palestinian civilian population of the Occupied Palestinian 
  Territories. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection 
  of Civilian Persons in Time of War prohibits the implementation of collective 
  punishment or reprisals against protected persons and their property. Since 
  the outbreak of confrontations over two weeks ago, Israeli military forces have 
  routinely utilized excessive and disproportionate force against Palestinian 
  civilians. Such uses of force include firing live ammunition into groups of 
  Palestinian protestors and firing into Palestinian residential areas with high-velocity 
  ammunition and missiles, both from the ground and from helicopter gunships hovering 
  over Palestinian cities. The affects of the siege on the Palestinian civilian 
  population have been extensive. In just over two weeks, over 100 Palestinians 
  have been killed, including 26 children, with an additional 4 declared clinically 
  dead. Recent statistics indicate that over 3,000 Palestinians have been injured, 
  including over 1,100 children. 
<p>Moreover, the Israeli occupation authorities have placed an internal closure 
  on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, effectively imprisoning Palestinian civilians 
  within their immediate city or town. The Old City of Hebron has been under complete 
  curfew for 13 days. In the Palestinian village of Selit Al-Thaher, near Jenin, 
  the Israeli army, yesterday, fired tear gas towards a secondary school, one 
  canister of which entered a classroom, suffocating 20 Palestinian students. 
  In the Old City of Hebron, Israeli military forces have transformed a Palestinian 
  girls school into a military installation. 
<p>In addition, illegal Israeli settlers continue their attacks against Palestinian 
  civilians, shooting towards Palestinian residents and destroying private property. 
  These attacks are carried out with the full knowledge of the Israeli military 
  forces, and, often, under their protection. Attacks have been particularly intense 
  in the Hebron District. Last night, in the village of Sa'ir, settlers attacked 
  and damaged five homes. Near the illegal Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba, 
  to the northwest of Hebron, settlers fire bombed a Palestinian car, totally 
  destroying it. In the same area, Palestinian cars were set on fire in the area 
  near Ta'lim settlement, and, settlers from Kufr Eztion, to the north of Hebron, 
  stoned Palestinian cars, injuring one civilian. In the village of Dura, settlers 
  from the nearby settlement of Hagai fired towards Palestinian homes. Thus far, 
  five Palestinian civilians have been killed as a result of settler attacks in 
  the past two weeks. 
<p>In light of the above and the escalation of events in the past 24 hours, DCI/PS 
  calls for the following: 
<ol>
  <li> That the Israeli government immediately cease its ongoing siege against 
    the civilian population of the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip 
    and put an end to its brutal use of force against the Palestinian people. 
  <li> That the international community immediately intervene and utilize the 
    powers at their disposal to fulfill their duty under common article 1, of 
    the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
    in Time of War (1949), to respect and ensure respect for the convention in 
    all circumstances. 
  <li> The establishment of an independent commission of inquiry to examine Israel's 
    recent and ongoing violations of international humanitarian and human rights 
    law in order that the individuals/institutions responsible be brought to justice, 
    in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1322.

<b>DCI/PS SUBMITS SUMMARY REPORT TO UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR OF THE COMMISSION ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS</b> 
<p>Today, DCI/PS submitted its summary report regarding the recent Israeli attack 
  on Palestinian civilians to Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, the UN Special Rapporteur 
  of the Commission on Human Rights. The following is an excerpt of the report 
  highlighting the findings of DCI/PS fieldwork. PLEASE SEE THE COMPLETE REPORT 
  ATTACHED. 
<p>Since the outbreak of the clashes, DCI/PS has documented the deaths of 24 Palestinian 
  children. These children ranged in age from 18 months to 18 years old. According 
  to DCI/PS fieldwork, each one of these children died after being hit with live 
  ammunition, including one child whose head was ripped in two after being hit 
  with a missile. All of them were shot in the upper parts of their body, with 
  at least 12 of them being shot in the head. At least 3 were hit with dum-dum 
  bullets, which explode upon impact. There are an additional 5 Palestinian children, 
  ranging in age from 9 to 17, who have been declared clinically dead after being 
  shot with live ammunition in the head. 
<p>According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (West Bank) and the Ministry 
  of Health (Gaza Strip), as of 11 October 2000, 1, 148 Palestinian children have 
  been injured as a result of the Israeli attack. DCI/PS has full information 
  regarding 474 cases. Of those, 84 were wounded with live ammunition, 313 with 
  rubber coated steel bullets, and 67 suffered suffocation from tear gas (please 
  see tables below). In addition, Israeli military forces beat 10 children. The 
  age distribution is as follows: 25 children 8 years and under; 67 children between 
  9 and 12; 167 children between 13 and 15; and, 215 children from 16 to 18 years 
  of age. Breaking down the figures of the total number of children injured by 
  live ammunition or rubber coated steel bullets, 397 cases, we see that 198, 
  or 49.87% were hit in the upper part of their body, while 199 were injured in 
  the other parts of the body, including the limbs (166) and pelvic area (8). 
  112 children were hit in the head; an additional 20 in the eyes; 16 in the back; 
  11 in the neck; 19 in the chest; and 20 in the abdomen. Six children were wounded 
  in both the limbs and upper body. These figures reflect that the Israeli military 
  forces are successfully targeting the upper part of the body with an apparent 
  intent to kill or seriously injure.

<h3>LAW</h3>
<b>Settler Attacks on Palestinian Civilians 13 October 2000</b> 
<p>Israeli settlers have been attacking Palestinians in Israel and the occupied 
  territories with total support from the Israeli occupation troops. 
<p>Since the time clashes began between the occupation troops and Palestinian 
  civilians on 28 September 2000, after the provocative visit of Likud opposition 
  leader Ariel Sharon, the region has been witnessing unprecedented activity of 
  the Israeli extreme right in both Israel and the occupied territories. The result 
  has been devastating: 5 Palestinians have been shot dead, 3 by settlers in the 
  occupied territories and 2 shot by the Israeli police in Nazareth during the 
  clashes that took place when settlers from Upper Nazareth launched their attack 
  against the Palestinian community in the city. Eyewitnesses say that settlers 
  have taken part in the shooting. 
<p>Settlers and Jewish racist extremists have been waging attacks inside the green 
  line since 6 October 2000. These orchestrated attacks are meant to terrorize 
  Palestinian civilians and target their lives and property. Reports say that 
  settlers have used live bullets in many cases under the cover and eye of the 
  Israeli occupation troops and in total impunity. 
<p>In light of this dangerous turn in the events, LAW has prepared this report 
  to describe these dangerous attacks. The report deals with the features of these 
  attacks and describes some of the events that took place despite the difficulties 
  faced by the field researchers to monitor and document these incidents. Field 
  researchers have also found it difficult to move around due to the military 
  siege imposed by the Israeli occupation troops in the West Bank and the Gaza 
  Strip. 
<p>First: Murder of Civilians Settlers have used live bullets against Palestinians 
  in a 'shoot to kill' policy. They also employed other means such as severe torture 
  and deliberate running over. Palestinians have unfortunately fallen victims 
  to this policy such as Sara Hasan, 1 and a half year old from the village of 
  Qasra, Isam Hamad, 39, from the village of Um Asafa, Mohammad Bouzieh, 39, from 
  Kuful Hares, all from the occupied West Bank. Meanwhile, 2 Palestinians, Omar 
  Akawi, 42, and Wisam Yazbak, 26, were killed in the city of Nazareth. 30 other 
  civilians were injured, 5 of whom sustained very serious injuries after the 
  clashes with the Upper Nazareth (Nazaret Ilit)settlers. 
<p> On 1 October 2000, one a half year-old Sarah was taken to the hospital by 
  her father HasanOn the way home, fully armed settlers opened fire on their car, 
  instantly killing Saran and injuring Hasan's 20-year-old niece. 
<p>On 8 October 2000, the body of Isam Hamad, 36, from Um Safa, Ramallah, was 
  found in a field near his village located near the Halmeesh settlement. His 
  brother, Basam, stated that Isam was driving to his village when an Israeli 
  military vehicle ordered him to stop. He was then taken in the direction of 
  the Halmeesh settlement. Hamad was found dead the next morning in a field near 
  Pisgot settlement. When the family members tried to take the body, they were 
  fired at from the settlement. They managed to take the body to their house and 
  later to the hospital in Ramallah. Preliminary examination has shown that he 
  was hit with a sharp tool in the head, his face was burned and his hands were 
  broken. He had bruises on his back and his left leg had been burned with an 
  iron. Evidence of electrocution were also found. 
<p>On 8 October 2000, an estimated one thousand Israeli extremist settlers from 
  Natzeret Illit (Higher Nazareth), supported by the Israeli police, attacked 
  East Nazareth; they broke into the homes of the Palestinian residents, and fired 
  at Palestinian civilians killing Omar Ikawi, 42, and Wisam Yazbik, 26, and wounding 
  thirty people, five of them critically. The deaths of Ikawi and Yazbik raise 
  the death toll of Palestinians within the Green Line, (in Israel) to 13. 
<p>On 11 October 2000, Mohammad Bouzieh, 39, from Kuful Hares in the district 
  of Salfit was overrun by a settler. An eyewitness stated that a car carrying 
  an Israeli license plate was spotted driving away from the accident site. 
<p>Second: Blockage of Roads As the oppressive operations by the Israeli occupation 
  troops were gaining momentum, settlers in the West Bank took to the streets 
  blocking exits and entrances to the major towns and villages and assaulting 
  Palestinian civilians and their property. During the attacks, settlers used 
  all sorts of weapons including stones, axes and batons. They rampaged villages, 
  destroying cars and property. On 6 October, settlers opened fire at a car wounding 
  the passengers at the Za'tara junction in the district of Nablus. On the same 
  evening, two Palestinian civilians, Tha'er Said, 21, and Amjad Safarini, 25, 
  from the village of Safarine in Toulkarem, were brutally assaulted and wounded 
  in the shoulders and face by settlers and had their car smashed. 
<p>On 8 October 2000, in another incident, a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance 
  was attacked smashed by settlers near the settlement of Shilo. The ambulance 
  received a call that settlers had beaten Palestinians. Upon arrival to the area, 
  the paramedics found out that the report was false. On their way back, a military 
  Jeep offered to accompany the ambulance into Ramallah saying that there were 
  settlers on the road that could assault them. Along the way, settlers did stop 
  the ambulance and the jeep. The soldiers got out of their jeep to speak with 
  the settlers and the settlers ran top to the ambulance and attacked it. 
<p>On 10 October 2000, two Palestinian reporters on their way back to Nablus were 
  pelted with stones thrown by settlers. The two Palestinians reported the incident 
  to Israeli troops but nothing was done about it. On the same evening, settlers 
  from Ofra assaulted Mustafa Qasem from Silwad hitting him with a sharp tool 
  on the head. In another incident, settlers also assaulted Mohammad Qasem, from 
  the village of Beitin. The two Palestinians were transferred to hospital for 
  treatment. 
<p>Third: Assault on individual and property Armed, protected and supported by 
  Israeli troops, the Israeli settlers have waged a number of attacks and assaults 
  on the civilian Palestinian population particularly the cities and surroundings 
  of Jerusalem, Hebron, Al Bireh and other parts of the West Bank. 
<p>Settlers tried entering and sealing off the Orient House in East Jerusalem 
  under the protection and sight of the Israeli occupation troops. However, angry 
  Palestinian youth challenged them and pushed them off. The settlers also took 
  to the Azahra Street, of East Jerusalem and sealed off the exits and entrances 
  of the city. In another incident, Hussein Atawil, 20, was wounded as young Palestinians 
  took to the street to prevent the settlers from gaining access to the Shu'fat 
  Refugee Camp. In other incidents, settlers rampaged motorway # 1 and stoned 
  Palestinian cars. 
<p>Settlers attacked the village of Bidya near Nablus. They burned shops and destroyed 
  electric power lines. Meanwhile, Israeli bulldozers blocked the roads and installed 
  make shift checkpoints preventing villagers from leaving. They also fired at 
  Palestinian houses. 
<p>In the village of Huwara, settlers attacked Palestinian houses and broke the 
  windows with stones and bullets. They also attacked the new built mosque, burning 
  copies of the Holy Koran and other religious books. The mosque 's carpets were 
  also set on fire. 
<p>In the district of Hebron, three Palestinian civilians from the village of 
  Sourif were wounded when settlers opened fire on them at the Beit Ummar junction. 
  Settlers in the city of Hebron hassled Palestinian residents, pelting them with 
  rocks, beating them or setting dogs on them. 
<p>On October 4, Aqel Awad's house came under fire from the nearby settlement 
  of Pisgot. Aqel's daughter stated that she and her family members were in the 
  house in the evening when live bullets were fired at the house. She stated, 
  ' I was ironing my clothes at that time, so I stopped. My father, 80 years old, 
  was in his room that overlooks the settlement. He is an old man partially paralysed. 
  I went to check on him. When things calmed down, I went out to the balcony to 
  close the door and I was hit with a bullet in the eye, but I did not hear the 
  shot. I fell to the floor and I shouted for rescue. I tried to crawl into the 
  room. My mother and brother came to my rescue. I was later transferred to the 
  Ramallah hospital. The injury was close to the eye. I was later taken to the 
  Arazi Ophthalmic hospital for further treatment especially as glass blisters 
  had filled my eye. I was later discharged. When I arrived home, I found out 
  that my brother was also hit with a bullet in the same place where I had been 
  hit before. No one heard any shots. The bullet hit him in the stomach and exited 
  through his back. He was in critical condition but is believed to be improving. 
  My brother is 54 years old. He lives in the States and he was here on a visit.' 
<p>The following is a list of a number of Palestinians whose property or being 
  had been assaulted: 
<ol>
  <li> Mahmoud Al Uqueili / Raboud village / Doura /Hebron 
  <li> Hamed Al Uqueili / Raboud village / Doura /Hebron 
  <li> Rizek Al Habiyat/ Raboud village / Doura / Hebron 
  <li> Eid Abul Kabash, 40, was hit with a bullet in his left leg at the Asamou' 
    junction. 
  <li> Samar Asharabati, old city in Henron was shot in the eye. 
  <li> Jamal Hammoud , 40, was beaten and suffers a fracture in the skull.
</ol>
<p>LAW reiterates the following: 
<p>. The Israeli government is fully responsible for situation that has developed 
  in the Occupied Territories and the violence committed against Palestinian civilians 
  by Israeli settlers 
<p>. LAW demands that those responsible for this aggression against Palestinians 
  be investigated and brought to trial. 
<p>.We demand that the United National Security Council take immediate action 
  to protect Palestinians civilians and force Israel to comply with articles of 
  the Fourth Geneva Convention
