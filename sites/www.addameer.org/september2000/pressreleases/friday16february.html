<b>Two Palestinians Killed and Scores Injured in Attacks by 
the 
Israeli Occupying Forces</b>

<p>While the UN Human Rights Inquiry Mission carries out its 
investigation, the Occupied Territories have witnessed an 
intensification of Israeli systematic human rights violations. Tanks 
and other heavy weaponry are once again being used against the 
civilian Palestinian population. Israeli Forces in the Occupied 
Territories continued their excessive use of force against 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday killing 
two Palestinians and leading to the deaths of two others. Al-Haq 
fieldworkers’ reports also indicate that scores of people were 
injured, including two foreign journalists. Those left dead were:

<p>Issam Rasheed al-Tawil, 29, from Hebron died of a gunshot 
wound to the belly sustained while at work on a farm on the 
outskirts of Hebron.
<p>Shaker Sulleman al-Manasra, 25, from Hebron died of a 
gunshot wound to the neck sustained while he was in his home.
<p>Mohammad Khader Ismael al-Hawande, 26, from al-Samu’ 
in the Hebron District died in a car crash while being pursued by 
Israeli forces.
<p>Abdul Rahman Makhmoud Juma’, 79, from Beit Le’id near 
Tulkarm died while being held for several hours at an Israeli 
checkpoint. At the time of his death he was attempting to reach a 
hospital. This case is still under investigation.
<p>
None of the above mentioned individuals were involved in clashes 
at the times of their deaths. These deaths bring to 358 the 
number of Palestinians killed since the outbreak of the al-Aqsa 
Intifada. Almost one third of those killed have been children 
under the age of 18. Fifteen Palestinians have been either 
assassinated or summarily executed.
<p>
In addition to the deaths reported yesterday Israeli forces once 
again shelled civilian areas in Hebron, El Bireh, and the Gaza 
Strip.<p>From 8:30 to 11:30 pm Israeli Forces in Hebron shelled 
and directed heavy machinegun fire at Palestinian controlled areas 
of the city. During this shelling and shooting both al-Tawil and al-
Manasra were killed. Seven other individuals were also seriously 
injured in these attacks. Yesterday afternoon Israeli tanks fired 
shells at protesters in El Bireh near Ramallah causing extensive 
damage to the Ministry of Local Government and an apartment 
building. At least ten civilians including two foreign journalists 
were injured. Finally, Khan Younis and Rafah in the Gaza Strip 
were shelled extensively throughout the night causing extensive 
damage to civilian property and numerous injuries. These attacks 
followed intense shelling in Khan Younis Thursday during which 
Jihan Qanan was struck in the belly by an Israeli bullet while in 
her home. Jihan was six months pregnant when shot, and the 
bullet that struck her lodged in the head of the fetus killing it and 
causing her to miscarry. She remains in the hospital in critical 
condition.
<p>
These actions come upon the heals of an intensification of the 
sieges and closures imposed as forms of collective punishment 
against the Palestinian people. Israel continues to act in total 
disregard of international humanitarian law, international human 
rights principles, and the demands of the international community. 
Al-Haq views with concern the Israeli aggression against 
Palestinian civilians, and reiterates the following demands:


<p>1. The United Nations Security Council should take the 
necessary measures to pressure the Israeli Government to 
stop its excessive use of force and aggression against 
Palestinian civilians. 

<p>2. The Security Council should reconsider its decision 
regarding the deployment of an international protections 
force for the Palestinian people and should immediately take 
steps to form such a force to ensure Israeli compliance with 
United Nations Resolutions and international law. </paraindent>
<p>3. Immediate action by the States Parties to the Fourth 
Geneva Convention to bear responsibility towards atrocities 
committed against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories,<bold> </bold>and 
to fulfill their legal obligations as High Contracting Parties of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention under Article 1 of the 
Convention that states that states must act “ to ensure respect 
for the present Convention in all circumstances”.

<p>
Since the beginning of the Intifada (the Palestinian Uprising) on 28
September 2000 and the strictly enforced hermetic closure and siege,
Israel has not permitted any family visits from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip to  political prisoners in Israeli prisons. As all parcels
for the prisoners can only be brought to the prison by the families,
the prisoners did not receive any warm clothing. Therefore WOFPP tried
personally to bring some winter clothes to the prison, but met with
refusal. WOFPP tried to obtain information as to who may grant
permission to bring clothing to the prisoners. There was no answer.
WOFPP then wrote to the Head of Israeli Prison Authorities, but again
no answer was given. 

<p>Neve Tirza Prison<br>
On 13 February 2001 lawyer Hisham Abu Shehadeh visited the prisoners
on behalf of WOFPP. From his report we learn that  
<p>
1)      The prisoners have not received any newspapers since the
beginning of February.
<p>
2)      During wintertime the daily recreation period in the prison is
supposed to start at 9 am. The prisoners complain that the wardens do
not allow them to start their recreation before 10 or even 11 am.
<p>
3)      The time allowed them to buy their necessities in the prison
canteen has been limited to the point of practically preventing them
from making their purchases.  (Due to the fact that the families
cannot help the prisoners, WOFPP has increased the canteen allowance).


<p>4)      The prisoners claim that new books in Arabic have been
supplied, but the prison authorities maintain that the wardens do not
have the time to take the prisoners to the library. 

<p>Suad Ghazal,  17 years old, from Sebastia. Suad's trial took place on
21 January 2001 in the Military Court in Dotan. She was condemned to 6
½ years in prison, of which she has purged 2 years. (For a minor it is
a harsh verdict). Suad wishes to continue her school studies, which
she was unable to do up to now. The prison authorities claimed that
she could not receive any books for studying purposes before being
sentenced. It is to be hoped  that the prison authorities will now
grant her permission to obtain the books she needs for her studies. 

<p>Nasreen Taha, 28 years old, from Bidiya near Nablus, mother of three
children. On 29 November she appeared before the Parole Board, but
they refused to release her before the end of her sentence. No reason
was given. She wishes to study for her matriculation and needs the
relevant books and material. 

<p>Maha Al-'Aak, 22 years old, from 'Aaida Refugee Camp near Bethlehem.
On 10 February she was brought to court in Jerusalem; her trial will
be continued at a later date. Her mother brought a letter from Maha's
sister. The letter was given to the warden accompanying her, but she
has not received it.

<p>Suna Gh'ai, 33 years old, from Tulkarem, mother of one child. Suna
complains that the criminal prisoners still continue harassing her and
the other political prisoners.



<p>New Detainee<br>
Amna Mona, 25 years old, from Bir Naballah near Jerusalem, was
arrested in mid-January. We do not have any details about her
whereabouts, because all the information concerning her is classified.
Only after her lawyer appealed to the High Court he was allowed to see
her, but not to speak with her. We learned from the newspapers that
her lawyer, Jawad Boulus, presented a petition seeking to prevent her
interrogators from depriving her of her rights, especially depriving
her of sleep. The High Court issued  a ruling that it was legal for
interrogators to deprive a suspect of sleep, if this was needed to
advance an investigation, "but not to exhaust the suspect or break his
or her spirit".
