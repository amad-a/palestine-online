SECRETARY-GENERAL, NOTING RECENT TURMOIL, SAYS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
MUST HELP PALESTINIANS, ISRAELIS IN 'HISTORIC QUEST FOR PEACE'  </b></p>
<p>

 



<p>Solidarity Observance Told of 'Despair, Frustration' in Occupied 
Territories; PLO Chairman States Terms on Which Authority Still 
Committed to Peace Process 


<p>On the occasion of the observance of the International Day of 
Solidarity with the Palestinian people, Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
this morning called on the international community to assist the 
Palestinians and the Israelis in their "historic quest" for peace. 

<p>Addressing a special meeting of the Committee on the Exercise of the 
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, the Secretary-General 
underscored the "growing sense of despair, frustration and anger" 
among Palestinians. It was absolutely essential to restore calm as 
soon as possible and revive the peace negotiations, in order to 
restart the economy. He further called on both sides to preserve the 
achievements of the nine-year peace process and steadily progress 
along the path to peace and reconciliation. 

<p>In a statement read on his behalf, Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and 
President of the Palestinian Authority, said the expectation had been 
that today's commemoration would be marked by the celebration of 
Palestine's admission as a Member of the United Nations. Instead, the 
Palestinian people were being subjected to a "bloody military 
campaign" waged by the occupying Power in an apparent attempt to break 
the political will of the Palestinians and its leadership and impose 
on them unacceptable solutions. He called for a United Nations 
observer force to be deployed in all localities occupied by Israel 
since 1967. He said the Palestinian Authority remained committed to 
the peace process on the basis of Security Council resolutions and the 
principle of land for peace. 

<p>The Chairman of the Committee, Ibra Deguene Ka (Senegal) drew 
attention to the "brutal interruption" of the peace negotiations in 
September. He said a settlement of the conflict required the parties' 
acceptance of and respect for all relevant United Nations resolutions. 
Only the full implementation of the recommendations produced at Sharm 
el-Sheikh and the immediate resumption of peace talks could end the 
crisis. 

<p>The President of the General Assembly, Harri Holkeri (Finland), said 
the year 2000 should have been special, in the sense that a final 
status agreement should have been reached. Instead, the situation had deteriorated 
sharply in recent weeks, challenging the very foundations of the peace 
process. He said the Assembly and the Security Council had responded 
with urgency and determination, and in accordance with the Assembly's 
position, the United Nations should retain a permanent responsibility 
towards the question of Palestine until it was effectively resolved in 
all its aspects, in accordance with international law and justice. 

<p>The President of the Security Council, Peter Van Walsum (Netherlands), 
stressed that the recent outbreak of violence was a grave concern and 
preoccupation of the Council, which had acted promptly in response to 
the situation on the ground. The parties should implement 
understandings swiftly and fully, and together confront the common 
problems associated with their unavoidable coexistence. 

<p>Statements were also made by the Chairman of the Special Committee to 
Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the 
Palestinian People and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; by the 
representative of South Africa on behalf of the Movement of 
Non-Aligned countries; by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia 
in his capacity as Chairman of the 27th Islamic Conference of Foreign 
Ministers; by the representative of Togo, on behalf of the 
Organization of African Unity (OAU), and by a representative of the 
League of Arab States. 

<p>An additional statement was made by a representative of the 
International Network of Non-Governmental Organizations on the 
Question of Palestine. 

<p>Messages of support and solidarity, in observance of the occasion, 
were received from the heads of State of Venezuela, Guinea, Brazil, 
Philippines, Afghanistan, Namibia, Cyprus, Lao People's Democratic 
Republic, Viet Nam, Tunisia, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Senegal, United 
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Morocco, Egypt, Algeria, Russian Federation, 
Cuba, Iran, Peru, and Turkey. 

<p>Messages were also sent by the heads of the Governments of Lesotho, 
Thailand, China, Mauritius, India, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Belarus. 
The observance was acknowledged by the Foreign Ministers of Oman, 
Hungary, Japan, Romania, Madagascar, Colombia, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, 
and Argentina. 

<p>Messages were received from the Governments of Uruguay, Central 
African Republic, Burkina Faso, Yemen, Pakistan, and Guyana, and from 
the Permanent Mission of Zimbabwe to the United Nations. 

<p>The European Union, the OAU, and the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference (OIC) and several NGOs also sent messages. 

<p>The head of the Political Department of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, also spoke.

AN URGENT APPEAL FROM THE WOMEN OF PALESTINE TO
THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD<br>

Join Hands for the Right to Life, Peace and Justice </b></p>




<p>Ramallah, Palestine -- On this day declared by the United Nations
General Assembly as a day of international solidarity with the
Palestinian people, the women of Palestine issue an urgent appeal
to
our sisters around the globe to join hands to defend the right of
Palestinian women, men and children to life, peace and justice under
international resolutions and international law.   As international
human rights day approaches on December 10, we specifically ask that
women throughout the world engage in lobbying, educational and protest
activities to demand:



<p>        ·          International protection for the Palestinian people
        as a responsibility of the international community under the
        Fourth Geneva Convention.

<p>        ·          Implementation of binding United Nations
        Resolutions, particularly 194, 224 and 338, calling for a
        total withdrawal of Israeli forces (including settlers) from
        the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza, including
        East Jerusalem and for the affirmation of the right of return
        of Palestinian refugee and a just solution to the refugee
        problem.



<p>As the death toll mounts daily, Israel's excessive force has already
resulted in the loss of 25O  Palestinian lives as of 25 November,  67
of which are children of seventeen years or younger, and 25 of which
are under the age of 14.   About 8000 Palestinians have been injured.
International protection is a right of the Palestinian people and a
responsibility of the international community under the Fourth Geneva
Convention.  We appreciate the call of United Nations Human Rights
Commissioner Mary Robinson to the High Contracting Parties of the
Geneva Convention to activate their responsibility and her support for
an international monitoring force and urge women around the world to
add their voice to this call for an effective international force to
protect the Palestinian people.



<p>Our letter to Mary Robinson during her visit to Palestine is attached
to our appeal to provide more information on what we call the
"invisible suffering" of Palestinian women.  We urge our sisters to
use this information to make the world aware of the daily sufferings
and struggles  of Palestinian women as they keep families together,
struggle to live on severely reduced income and resources, visit the
injured,  march with candles held high to commemorate the dead and
affirm the right to life, mourn their and other mother's children, and
fight for a better future in an independent Palestine.



<p>We also greatly appreciate the upcoming visit of Italian women to
Palestine under the banner "I, A woman, am going to Palestine," where
women aim to serve as witnesses "in defence of Palestinian civilians,"
and for "the right to life, land and freedom of the Palestinian
people" and for "peace between Israelis and Palestinians."  We
appreciate their courage and commitment and welcome women from around
the world  to join in similar initiatives.

<p>We urge you to conduct information campaigns and educational
activities in your community, as well as to lobby your government for
international protection for the Palestinian people and the
implementation of United Nations resolutions calling for a total
withdrawal of Israeli forces to the 1967 borders and a just solution
to the refugee problem.



<p>To join the Women for Women network,  please send an email to Women's
Affairs Technical Committee, the coordinating network for Palestinian
women's organizations at watcorg@palnet.com   Please send us news or
your activities, petitions and events and we will pass them on to
other women.

Israeli occupation forces continue killing Palestinians: 
More sweeping and demolition by the Israeli occupation forces  </b></p>
<p>The past 24 hours witnessed more victims among Palestinian civilians 
as a result of shooting by the Israeli occupation forces. These 
forces opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators near Al-Mentar (Karni) 
Outlet, to the east of Gaza City, killing a young man with a live 
bullet in the head. In the village of Rammoun in Ramallah, a young 
man died as a result of inhaling tear gas used intensively by the 
Israeli occupation forces when they raided the village. A child from 
Rafah died from a previous wound, incurred on November 23, 2000, 
caused by an exploding bullet in the head. In Amman, yesterday 
evening, a young man from Gaza was pronounced dead from a previous 
wound with bullets in the neck and the chest that were shot by the 
Israeli occupation forces on November 19, 2000. Today, although there 
was a significant decrease in clashes with the Israeli occupation 
forces, these forces continued to shoot at Palestinian civilians. In 
addition, these forces continued to reinforce their presence, to sweep 
more areas of agricultural land and to demolish more houses in the 
Gaza Strip. 

<p>1. Shooting at Palestinian Civilians 

<p>This morning, clashes broke out between Palestinian civilians and the 
Israeli occupation forces. In the area near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, 
four Palestinian civilians were wounded with live bullets shot by the 
Israeli occupation forces. Near the borderline in Rafah, the Israeli 
occupation forces shot at Palestinian civilians in Al-Barazil 
neighborhood, wounding four. In the eastern area of Al-Boreij refugee 
camp, this afternoon, a Palestinian civilian was wounded with a live 
bullet shot by the Israeli occupation forces. 

<p>Yesterday afternoon, in the area near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, the 
Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian civilians demonstrating 
more than 100 meters away from these forces. As a result, Emad Adib 
El-Dayeh, 19 years old, from Al-Shati refugee camp, was shot dead with 
a live bullet in the head. El-Dayeh was evacuated to Shifa’ hospital, 
but was pronounced dead at about 20:00 local time. 

<p>Yesterday evening, a large number of Israeli occupation troops raided 
the village of Rammoun in Ramallah, where Palestinian civilians faced 
them. The Israeli occupation forces used tear gas intensively against 
Palestinian civilians. As a result, Ibrahim Abdel-Jabber Kuhleh, 24 
years old, died from inhaling tear gas. Eyewitnesses stated that 
Kuhleh was evacuated to a hospital in Ramallah due to difficulty 
breathing. He died before reaching the hospital. 

<p>Also yesterday evening, Karam Fathi El-Kurd, 14 years old, died at 
Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City from a previous wound caused by an 
exploding live bullet in the head, incurred on November 23, 2000, when 
the Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian civilians 
demonstrating near Salah El-Din Gate on the borderline in Rafah. 

<p>Yesterday, Ashraf Abdel-Karim El-Basous, 19 years old, from Gaza, died 
from a previous wound with live bullets in the neck and chest shot by 
the Israeli occupation forces near Al-Mentar (Karni) outlet, to the 
east of Gaza City. El-Basous was transferred to a hospital in Jordan 
on November 22, 2000, and was pronounced dead yesterday. 

<p>Yesterday evening, Israeli occupation troops, positioned in a military 
post in the vicinity of Gani Tal settlement, to the north of Al-Amal 
neighborhood in Khan Yunis, opened fire on Palestinian civilians, 
wounding two, one of whom was seriously injured. Eyewitnesses stated 
that the incident took place at 22:30 local time when there were no 
clashes in the area. The two wounded persons were near their houses 
when they were hit by bullets. They are: 
<p>
1) Amin Mohammed Abdel-Qader Abu Mosallam, 24 years old, wounded with 
a live bullet in the thigh; and 2) Sami Abdullah Ahmed, 18 years old, 
wounded with a live bullet in the right thigh that caused a cut in an 
artery. He was evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City. 

<p>2. Continued Sweeping of Agricultural Land 
<p>
Yesterday, at about 22:00 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
swept more areas of agricultural land on the northern side of the road 
branching from Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the north 
and south of the Gaza Strip) leading to Kissufim Border Crossing in 
the east. The swept areas are about 1,000 meters from Salah El-Din 
Street. PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that the sweeping 
included: 1) A two-donum area of agricultural land, on which two 
greenhouses planted with vegetables were established, owned by Awadh 
El-Semeiri. In addition, an irrigation network was destroyed. 2) A 
one-donum area of agricultural land, on which a greenhouse planted 
with vegetables was established, owned by Aae’d Abu Haddaf. 3) A 
10-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Suleiman El-Semeiri. 4) A 10-donum area of agricultural land planted 
with olives, owned by Mohammed Abu Haddaf. 5) A 120-square-meter, 
one-story house owned by Ismail El-Saffi. 
<p>
While the Israeli occupation forces continued to close the road 
between Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction, to the south of Gaza City, 
and Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza City, PCHR’s field 
officer in the area reported that yesterday, at about 17:00 local 
time, these forces started to sweep more areas (approximately 200 
meters worth) along the road. Because of the heavy presence of the 
Israeli occupation forces in the area, reinforced with six tanks, 
PCHR’s field officer could not reach the area to check on the swept 
areas. According to a resident of the area, the sweeping included: 
<p>
1) An eight-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned 
by the El-Thalathini family. <p>2) A 12-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with citrus, owned by the El-Ghefari family. In addition, a 
well and an 80-square-meter house were destroyed. 

<p>PCHR’s field officer stated that the Israeli occupation forces have 
been building a new settlement road for more than one week, connecting 
the road branch of Al-Shuhada (Netzarim) junction and Al-Mentar 
(Karni) Outlet with the borderline. 

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have so far swept: 
<p>1) A 7.5 donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Baker Oleyan El-Heraqli. <p>2) An eight-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with olives, owned by Mohammed Mahmoud Hajjaj. <p>3) A five-donum 
area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Ne’man Hajjaj. 
<p>4) A seven-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned 
by Mohammed Muheisen Hajjaj. <p>5) An eight-donum area of agricultural 
land planted with olives, owned by the Abu El-Atta family. 

<p>Also yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces swept areas of 
agricultural land and demolished buildings along the road branching 
from Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the north and south of 
the Gaza Strip) leading to Gush Qatif settlement block (Al-Matahen 
Junction). PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that the sweeping 
and demolition included: <p>1) A 10-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with olives, owned by the heirs of Jbara Ismail El-Farra.<p> 2) A 
60-donum area of agricultural land planted with vegetables, owned by 
the heirs of Rafiq Jbara El-Farra. In addition, a well, two water 
pumps, two rooms and an irrigation network were destroyed. <p>3) An 
eight-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Sae’b Mustafa El-Farra. <p>4) A 150-square-meter house, in which four 
people lived, owned by Abdel-Mou’ti Abu Ghayyadh. <p>5) A 
500-square-meter tin house, in which 13 people lived, owned by 
Mohammed Salim Hussein Abu Hassan. <p>6) A 120-square-meter house, in 
which seven people lived, owned by Mohammed Suleiman Boreis. <p>7) A 
148-square-meter house, in which eight people lived, owned by Salim 
Suleiman El-Musseeb.<p> 8) A 120-square-meter house, in which 14 people 
lived, owned by Nayef Suleiman El-Musseeb. 

<p>In Al-Qarara, near Khan Yunis, the Israeli occupation forces swept 
areas of agricultural land and demolished houses, 250 meters to the 
east of Salah El-Din Street. PCHR’s field officer in the area 
reported that this particular action included: <p>1) A nine-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Fuad and Jamal Mabrouk 
El-Qedra. In addition, an irrigation network was destroyed.<p> 2) A 
15-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by the 
heirs of Mabrouk Ismail El-Qedra. <p>3) A 0.5 donum area of agricultural 
land planted with olives, owned by Kamel Mabrouk El-Qedra.<p> 4) An 
80-square-meter house, in which eight people lived, owned by Sami 
Ismail El-Qedra. The house was surrounded by 500 square meters of 
agricultural land planted with olives.<p> 5) A 90-square-meter house, in 
which eight people lived, owned by Suleiman Salem Abu Rezeq. <p>6) 
Cutting electricity and water to a number of houses in the area. 
<p>
3. Continued Reinforcements and Blocking of Roads in the Gaza Strip by 
the Israeli occupation forces 
<p>
The Israeli occupation forces have continued to reinforce their 
presence throughout the occupied Palestinian territories. In the Gaza 
Strip, tanks and armored vehicles of the Israeli occupation forces are 
still stationed on Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the 
north and south of the Gaza Strip). The Israeli occupation forces 
have closed this road and its branch and agricultural roads near Kfar 
Darom settlement. This has divided the Gaza Strip into isolated areas. 

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have continued to impose a siege on 
Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area in Rafah and Khan Yunis, increasing the 
suffering of Palestinian residents of the area. In Khan Yunis, the 
Israeli occupation forces have continued to close the road between 
Khan Yunis city and its Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area – under the 
control of these forces – at Al-Tuffah roadblock. Jarir El-Qedwa 
elementary and preparatory school is still closed because its 
teachers, most of whom are from Khan Yunis city, have not been able to 
reach the area. Agricultural products have been damaged because 
farmers have been denied access to their agricultural land. 

<p>In Rafah, the Israeli occupation forces have kept up their actions of 
collective punishment by continuing to impose a total siege on the 
occupied Palestinian territories and by closing Gaza International 
Airport and Rafah Border Crossing. On November 25, 2000, the Israeli 
occupation forces re-closed Al-Karama border crossing on the 
Palestinian-Jordanian border. Yesterday, Israeli sources stated that 
the Israeli occupation forces reopened Rafah Border Crossing, but 
after this statement was checked for accuracy, it was clear that 
yesterday, November 28, 2000, the Israeli employees at the Crossing 
completed the entry procedures for about 100 people from Egypt into 
the Gaza Strip, while no one from the Palestinian side was present 
save for the director of the Palestinian Civil Liaison. This morning, 
the Department for Crossing of the Palestinian National Authority 
refused to send any Palestinian staff to the Crossing in protest over 
the changing work conditions violating previously signed agreements. 
The new conditions that the Israeli occupation forces attempted to 
establish were the following: <p>1) Work will be limited to travelers 
coming from abroad, while residents of the Gaza Strip will not be able 
to travel abroad. <p>2) The reduction of Palestinian personnel from 320 
to seven. <p>3) Members of the Palestinian security services are 
prohibited from returning to their work at the Crossing.<p> 4) 
Palestinian personnel must undergo security checks by the Israeli 
occupation forces. <p>5) Work at the Crossing will continue for only 
seven hours per day, 8:00-15:00 local time, although the Crossing in 
the past was open 24 hours per day. <p>6) Cars of Palestinian personnel 
and VIPs will not be allowed to enter the Crossing. <p>*** PCHR 
reiterates its call for the international community to immediately 
intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the 
Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians. PCHR calls in 
particular for: 

<p>1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in 
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and 
killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians.<p> 2. Convening a conference of the High 
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure 
Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Convention.<p> 3. 
Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the 
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces.<p> 4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights.<p> 5. Providing 
humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose 
living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the 
continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
entire occupied Palestinian territories. <p>6. Use by the international 
community and relevant bodies, including ICRC, of necessary measures 
to ensure the access of medical supplies and equipment and other 
humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. The Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to deny entry of this material 
through Rafah Border Crossing (into the Gaza Strip).
