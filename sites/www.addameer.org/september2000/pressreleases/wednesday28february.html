<b>One Palestinian Civilian is Killed in his Home as
Israeli Occupying Forces Continue to Indiscriminately 
Shell Civilian 
Palestinian Areas</b>

 
<p>Israeli Occupying Forces launched punitive attacks upon civilian 
Palestinian areas following clashes between Palestinian 
demonstrators and Israeli Forces yesterday. From 6:00 to 10:00 
pm Israeli tanks located on a hill to the east of the Beit El Military 
Camp that overlooks the Palestinian city of El Bireh 
indiscriminately fired shells into residential neighborhoods of El 
Bireh.<p>
Fifty-Four year old Naim Ahmed Mohammad al-Badareen was 
killed by a tank shell that penetrated the wall of his home and 
struck him in the torso. His body was torn apart, and the 
collection of all of the pieces of his body took hospital workers 
several hours. Naim lived in a two-story building along with 
fourteen other members of his family including his children and 
grandchildren. His home was struck by a total of four shells, 
which caused extensive structural damage. According to initial 
Israeli reports shelling commenced in response to shooting by 
Palestinians located in El Bireh. However, documentation and 
affidavits collected by an al-Haq fieldworker show that there was 
no shooting anywhere in the vicinity of Naim’s house which is in 
the al-Balou’ neighborhood located on the northern side of El 
Bireh. The incidents to which the Israeli authorities claimed to be 
responding occurred across the city from al-Balou’ in the Rafat 
neighborhood located on the southern side of the city. This attack 
occurred exactly one week after Israeli Tanks opened fire upon 
Beit Jala, hitting the home of, and killing, Mohammad Ibrahim al-
Korbi, age 19.<p>
Soon after the outbreak of the Intifada the Israeli authorities 
began using helicopters and tanks to shell targets in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories both as a “preventative measure” against 
targets that it claimed were being used as staging points by 
Palestinian gunmen trying to launch attacks against Israeli soldiers 
and settlers and as a “retaliatory measure”, as was the case after 
the killing of two Israelis in Ramallah in October. Targets that 
have been hit have included, but are not limited to, buildings 
located near main flashpoints, police installations, residential 
neighborhoods, businesses, industrial sites, schools, and hospitals. 
Every major Palestinian city and many towns and villages have 
been shelled. Fire from helicopter gunships, tanks, and heavy 
machine-guns has been indiscriminately directed towards civilian 
homes and businesses. Evidence gathered by al-Haq fieldworkers 
contradicts Israel’s claims that attacks have only targeted 
“strategic” or military targets, or buildings used as staging points 
for attacks. Twenty-eight Palestinian civilians have been killed 
and many have been injured in these attacks.<p>
Israeli shelling of civilian areas is a clear violation of Article 53 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. It is also a grave breach 
of the convention under Article 147, which prohibits the 
“extensive destruction and appropriation of property”. 
Additionally, it violated Articles 22, 23, and 25 of the 1907 Hague 
Regulations. Israel has recognized the applicability and of both 
the Hague convention and the Fourth Geneva Convention to the 
Occupied Territories<p>
The Israeli authorities have ignored repeated condemnations of 
their use of tanks, gunships, and heavy weaponry against civilian 
areas, and will continue to do so until effective action is taken by 
the international community to end Israeli aggression. It is in this 
light that al-Haq reiterates the following demands:

<p>1. The international community should take appropriate action 
to sanction Israel for its continuous shelling of Palestinian 
civilian areas. Israel’s targeting of civilian areas is illegal 
under international law and constitutes a war crime that should 
be investigated. Those found responsible for committing or 
ordering the commission of such crimes should be tried. 

<p>2. States Party to the Fourth Geneva Convention should act 
immediately to provide the Palestinian people with protection 
from Israeli human rights violations and demand an end to 
abuses committed by Israeli forces. Israel continues to 
commit grave breaches of the convention that obligate States 
Parties to act under Article 1, which calls for them “to respect 
and ensure respect for the present Convention in all 
circumstances."
<p>3. The Security Council and the UN General Assembly must 
end their indefensible silence regarding Israeli’s blatant 
violations against Palestinian’s human rights.
<p>4. The international community should take the necessary 
measures to pressure the Israeli Government to stop its 
excessive use of force and aggression against Palestinian 
civilians and to end its belligerent occupation. 
<p>5. The Security Council should reconsider its decision 
regarding the deployment of an international protections force 
for the Palestinian people and should immediately take steps to 
form such a force to ensure Israeli compliance with United 
Nations Resolutions and international law.

<b>Settler Violence and Occupation<br>


23rd  – 27th of February</b>


<p>

23.02.01<br>

Dozens of settlers from Bita' Settlement (West of Bethlehem) threw

stones and other metal objects toward passing Palestinian cars on 
the

road between Husan and Nahhalin. Several of the cars' windshields 
were

damaged and broken.

<p>
24.02.01<br>

Settlers from Itamar Settlement (North of the West Bank) 
confiscated

livestock of about 150 sheep and goats, belonging to the residents 
of

the Akraba' village which is located in the east of Nablus.  The

settlers claim that these sheep entered the settlement's territory,

though the Palestinians insist that this land is within their

territory. Major Ghaleb Mayadema, from Akraba' Village, reported that

the settlers also attacked 3 of the sheep owners (Bilal Fahmi Mansour,

Tha'r Bani Jaber, Ahmad Shuhada). (All actions were conducted with the

use of arms.)
<p>

Settlers from the Gush Katif Settlement took over dozens of hectacres

of agricultural land belonging to Khanunis (Gaza), under the

protection of IDF soldiers. Previous AIC releases reported activity of

confiscation and leveling of land by bulldozers in this area. Land

expropriated from the Abadillah family is now leveled and surrounded

by a 2-meter high fence and will be used for expanding the Gush Katif

Settlement.

<p>
25.02.01<br>

Settlers from Alei settlement uprooted more than 1000 olive trees that

belong to the Awdalla family from Cariut village, in the east of

Nablus.

<p>
26.02.01<br>

In the Bethlehem area, bulldozers, guarded by soldiers, continued

opening roads and destroying Palestinian fields between the villages

of Kissam and Il Rashayda, as part of the expansion of Ma'aleh Amos

settlement.

<p>
27.02.01<br>

Settlers gathered at the Tunnel Road, linking from Jerusalem to 

Hebron, in order to demonstrate against the lack of security and lack

of military protection they receive. In direct response, the road was

completely closed to Palestinian vehicles.
<p> The AIC is a Palestinian-Israeli organization which disseminates information, 
  research and political analysis on Palestinian and Israeli societies as well 
  as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while promoting cooperation between Palestinians 
  and Israelis based on the values of social justice, solidarity and community 
  involvement.

<b>Al-Haq Demands a Full
Investigation into the Death while in Detention of Salim 
Hassan Aqra’</b>


<p>
Al-Haq is deeply concern by the death yesterday under unclear 
circumstances, and while being detained by the Palestinian 
Military Intelligence Service, of 33 year old Salim Hassan Aqra’ 
from Kablan in the Nablus district. According to information 
given by Salim’s brother, Salim was detained by the Military 
Intelligence Service in Nablus on 6 January 2001, and placed in 
detention in a Palestinian Military Intelligence prison. Requests 
for information regarding the reason for his detention made by his 
family were denied and no charges were filed. He was also 
forbidden to have visitors. Salim’s health quickly deteriorated, and 
on 22 February 2001 he was transferred to the National Hospital 
in Nablus. Salim’s brother reported that he was allowed to see 
Salim’s body prior to its transfer to Abu Dis where an autopsy is 
to be preformed. He stated that there were clear signs of torture 
upon his brother’s body. <p>
Al-Haq views with grave concern the continued use of torture in 
Palestinian detention centers under the administration of the 
Palestinian Security Apparatuses, and calls for a full investigation 
into this case.Al-Haq also calls upon the Palestinian National 
Authority to release the results of the autopsy to be performed 
upon Salim’s body. The PNA must establish clear guidelines that 
prohibit the use of torture and force against detainees. While a 
directive by the civil police commander in Gaza to this effect was 
released in 1995, it does not have the weight of law. Al-Haq has 
documented reports of beatings, sleep deprivation, burning, and 
other methods of torture used by various Palestinian security 
services.<p>
Al-Haq views with further concern the irresponsible disregard of 
the Palestinian Security Services of the repeated appeals that 
have been addressed to them by human rights organizations urging 
them to stop the use of torture and other cruel, inhumane, or 
degrading treatment or punishment. These actions are clear 
violations of international human rights instruments including the 
International Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on civil and Political rights.<p>
Al-Haq condemns these gross human rights violations and 
demands the following:<p>
1. That the Palestinian National Authority intervene to end these 
practices.<p>2.That an independent investigative committee be formed to 
look into the death of Salim Hassan Aqra’.
<p>3.That all steps be taken to investigate and, if it can be proven 
that torture has occurred, prosecute those individuals who were 
involved in carrying out the torture of prisoners and detainees.<p>
4. That the Palestinian National Authority take immediate 
measures to guarantee that the various Palestinian Security 
Apparatuses respect and apply the international conventions and 
agreements that deal specifically with the treatment of detainees 
and prisoners, specifically, the Convention Against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhumane or degrading Treatment or Punishment 
and the Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons Under 
Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment.
<p>5.That the Legislative Council form a Special Committee to 
Supervise and monitor the conditions of the detainees and the 
prisoners, in prisons and places of detention, in order to guarantee 
that the minimum international standards for the treatment of 
prisoners is being implemented. 
<p>6. That, keeping in mind the pressing situation brought about by 
the Intifada, and the proliferation of human rights violations 
committed by the Israeli Occupying Forces that affect all aspects 
of Palestinian life, the Palestinian Legislative Council immediately 
draft and adopt a law that specifically prohibits torture and other 
inhumane practices.
