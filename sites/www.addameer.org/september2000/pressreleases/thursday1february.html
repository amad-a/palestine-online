Occasional Bulletin No. 4
Published by 
BADIL Resource Center

<p>This Bulletin aims to provide a brief overview 
of issues related to Palestinian Refugee Rights
<p>
February 2000 

<p>
Refugee choice, often referred to as voluntariness, is the primary
principle governing the right of refugees to return to their homes and
the cornerstone of international refugee protection. What exactly does
the term "refugee choice" mean and what are the practical steps
required to ensure implementation of the principle of refugee choice? 
<p>
The following Bulletin provides a brief overview of refugee choice as
incorporated into UN General Resolution 194(III) affirming the right
of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and receive
compensation AND an overview of refugee choice as interpreted by the
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
<p>
UN RESOLUTION 194 AND REFUGEE CHOICE
<p>
The principle of refugee choice was the foundation for 
recommendations drafted by the UN Mediator in Palestine, Count Folke
Bernadotte, for durable solutions for Palestinian refugees. The
recommendations are contained in the Mediator's September 1948
PROGRESS REPORT to the UN General Assembly. (UN Doc. A/648, 1948). In
his report, Bernadotte writes that it was an "unconditional right" of
the refugees "to make a FREE CHOICE [which] should be fully
respected." (emphasis added). This language was eventually
incorporated into the final version of paragraph 11 of UN Resolution
194, 11 December 1948, in which the General Assembly "Resolve[d] that
refugees WISHING to return to their homes and live a peace with their
neighbors SHOULD be permitted to do so..." (emphasis added).
<p>
The emphasis on refugee choice (or the wishes of the refugees) 
reflected a number of factors. First, recognition of refugee choice -
i.e., their voluntary return - was considered by the General Assembly
to be appropriate remedy to their INVOLUNTARY departure. Bernadotte
touches on this point when he lists the reasons for the "exodus of
Palestinian Arabs," including: "panic created by fighting in their
communities, by rumors concerning real or alleged acts of terrorism,
or expulsion." The emphasis on refugee choice in Resolution 194 also
reflected post WWII developments in refugee protection. While many of
the bodies established in Europe to facilitate solutions for groups of
refugees during the first part of the 20th century (such as the Office
of the High Commissioner for Russian Refugees and the UN Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration) focused on repatriation, it was not
until the creation of the International Refugee Organization in 1947
that the international community recognized the principle of VOLUNTARY
repatriation. This came at a time of growing concern in the West about
forced repatriation of refugees to countries governed by Communist
regimes, and developments in human rights law with its focus on
individual rights. 
<p>
Reviewing the drafting history of Resolution 194, the UN Secretariat
confirmed that paragraph 11 "intended to confer upon the refugees as
individuals the right of exercising a FREE CHOICE as to their future."
(UN Doc. A/AC.25/W.45, 1950). (emphasis added). The legal advisor to
the UN Economic Survey Mission reached the same conclusion: "The verb
'choose' indicates that the General Assembly assumed that the
principle [i.e., the right of return] would be fully implemented, and
that all the refugees would be given a FREE CHOICE as to whether or
not they wishes to return home." (UN Doc. W/32, 1950). (emphasis
added).
<p>
The UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP), established to
provide international protection and facilitate implementation of
paragraph 11 also noted in numerous early reports that refugees would
require information about the conditions in their places of origin in
order to decide whether their wished to exercise their right of
return. The UNCCP also requested members of the Commission's Technical
Committee, established in the summer of 1949, to begin examining what
kind of mechanism would be necessary to determine the choices of each
refugee.
<p>
UNHCR AND REFUGEE CHOICE 
<p>
Refugee choice or voluntariness is the cornerstone of UNHCR 
repatriation programs and is dealt with extensively in the Office's
1996 HANDBOOK ON VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION: INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION. The
UNHCR notes that refugee choice is affected both by conditions in the
host country and by conditions in the country of origin.
"Voluntariness means not only the absence of measures which push the
refugee to repatriate," states the UNCHR HANDBOOK, "but also means
that he or she should not be prevented from returning, for example, by
dissemination of wrong information or false promises of continued
assistance." (emphasis added).
<p>
In other words, the denial of basic rights guaranteed under the 1951
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and pressure or threats
on refugees to leave by interest groups or HOST COUNTRY authorities,
inhibit refugee choice and potentially render decisions to be less
than voluntary. On the other hand, discrimination in domestic
legislation and provision of essential services, lack of guarantees
for the safety of returnees, and attempts to encourage anti-refugee
sentiment among the population in the COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, also prevent
refugees from making a free choice as to whether they wish to exercise
their right of return. 
<p>
INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO REFUGEE CHOICE. Refugees should be 
provided with as much information as possible concerning the 
conditions in their country of origin. Information should be 
disseminated via, among others, posters and leaflets, oral 
presentations, videos, refugee information committees, and through
counseling by international protection staff and reconnaissance visits
by refugee groups to areas of return. 
<p>
The UNHCR HANDBOOK further provides a list of the type of information
to be provided to refugees. This includes, for example, a description
of the conditions in the country of origin in general, as well as
details of the situation in specific area(s) of return, including the
level of security. Refugees should be further informed about what type
of protection will be provided upon their return in addition to the
type of assistance to expect (such as infrastructure rehabilitation
projects) and what not to expect.  Prior to making choices, refugees
should receive a text of guarantees or assurances provided by the
government of the country of origin, supplemented by explanations as
to their content and scope.
<p>
Details about the REPATRIATION PROCEDURE should also be provided. This
includes information on: customs, immigration and health formalities;
procedures for bringing personal and communal property; access to land
and restitution procedures; registration and documentation for
repatriation; the timing and phasing of the repatriation operation;
special arrangements for vulnerable groups such as women, children and
the elderly; de-registration procedures for assistance, if any; and,
procedures and options for those not wishing to repatriate. Refugees
should also be aware of how to contact international protection staff
in their country of origin in case of protection problems. 
<p>
REFUGEE CHOICE, PEACE AGREEMENTS, AND INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION
<p>
Determination of refugee choice cannot be undertaken prior to a peace
agreement, which explicitly recognizes the right of refugees to return
to their homes and provides guarantees for the voluntary character of
return - i.e., refugee choice. Without guarantees for implementation
of the right of return as codified in a peace agreement, refugees
cannot make an informed, free choice about whether they wish to
return. In other words, REFUGEE CHOICE CANNOT PRECEDE RECOGNITION OF
THE RIGHT OF RETURN BY THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, AND PROVISIONS FOR ITS
IMPLEMENTATION.
<p>
Numerous recent peace agreements affirm the principle of refugee
choice. Article 1 of Annex 7 to the 1995 Dayton Agreement, for
example, affirms the right of refugees and displaced persons from
Bosnia-Herzegovina "FREELY to return to their homes of origin." The
parties to the Agreement, moreover, "undertake to create in their
territories the political, economic, and social conditions conducive
to the VOLUNTARY RETURN and harmonious reintegration of refugees and
displaced persons." (Art. II). (emphasis added). The "FREE WILL on the
part of each refugee" to exercise their right of return to Rwanda, as
another example, is affirmed in article 2 of the 1993 Protocol of
Agreement Between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic
Front. (emphasis added).
<p>
Further provisions to ensure refugee choice are provided in 
tripartite agreements between the country of origin, country of 
asylum and the UNHCR in its role as the international protection
agency. The language of Article 7 of the UNHCR's sample tripartite
agreement (annexed to the 1996 HANDBOOK) is clear: "The Parties and
UNHCR hereby reaffirm that the repatriation of .... Refugees in
(country of asylum) shall only take place at their FREELY EXPRESSED
WISH based on their full knowledge of the facts." Article 8 further
states: "The Parties and UNHCR reiterate that the refugees SHALL BE
FREE to return to, and settle in, their former places of residence or
any other places of their choice with (country of origin)." (emphasis
added) The tripartite agreement goes on to describe the mechanism to
be established to facilitate the choice of the refugees and the host
of requirements already described above. 
<p>
Once all these agreements are in place, the appropriate conditions for
making a free choice exist in the host country and country of origin,
and refugees are supplied with adequate information, it is then
possible to proceed with the determination of refugee choice. In order
to carry out all these procedures there must be an international
protection body responsible for the refugees. International protection
staff must be assured access to refugees in host countries to verify
and facilitate refugee choice and they must have access to the
returning refugee population in the country of origin to ensure that
the rights of refugees are respected and the obligations of the
country of origin fulfilled.  
<p>
In the case of Palestinian refugees, however, there is no 
international agency that currently provides international 
protection. The UN General Assembly originally assigned this role to
the UNCCP, however, the mandate of the Commission has been devolved to
the point whereby Palestinian refugees have been effectively denied
the right to international protection as afforded to all other
refugees. THEREFORE, A FURTHER PRECONDITION EXISTS FOR DETERMINING THE
CHOICE OF PALESITNIAN REFUGEES – i.e., the ASSUMPTION OF INTERNATIONAL
PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIAN REFUGEES BY THE UNHCR (as provided for in
Article 1D of the 1951 Refugee Convention; again see BADIL Brief No.
1); OR THE CREATION OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION AGENCY.

<p>TO REITERATE, 
The principle of voluntariness or refugee choice is the cornerstone of
international protection and the search for durable solutions for
refugees. UN Resolution 194 affirms the right of Palestinian refugees
to choose to return to their homes. Refugee choice must be free and
voluntary. In order for refugees to make a free and voluntary choice
to return to their homes and places of origin:
<p>
(1) Peace agreements, which recognize the right of refugees to return
and provide mechanisms and guarantees for implementation, must be in
place prior to the determination of refugee choice. <p>(2) An
international protection body is necessary to verify refugee choice
and ensure its implementation through procedures set forth in a
tripartite agreement between the host country, the country of origin,
and the protection body. <p>(3) Refugees must not be compelled to leave
the host country or prevented from returning to their country of
origin.<p> (4) Refugees must be supplied with information about the
conditions in their country of origin, provisions for safety and
protection from the authorities in the country of origin, and details
about the procedures for repatriation.

Agenda items 40, 41 and 85

The situation in the Middle East

Question of Palestine

<p>Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices

Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other 
Arabs

of the Occupied TerritoriesSecurity Council Fifty-sixth year 


<p>Identical letters dated 1 February 2001 from the Permanent 
Observer


of Palestine to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General

and to the President of the Security Council



<p>
I wish to convey to you the serious concern of the Palestinian

leadership regarding the possible use by Israel, the occupying Power,

of depleted uranium shells against Palestinian targets, especially

during the more recent and intensified Israeli military campaign over

the last few months. Several reports have indicated that Israel has

used such ammunition, causing great anxiety among the Palestinian

people in the occupied territory.
<p>

In this connection, on 30 January 2001, the Israeli army issued a

press statement in which it stated that "the Israeli army has never

utilized these munitions against any civilian population". This

language can only indicate that the Israeli army does indeed possess

this kind of ammunition in its arsenal and that it has used it in the

past. Further, the issue of "civilian population" remains a matter of

definition, as Israel has repeatedly indicated in the past. In our

opinion, this press statement alone justifies raising the issue in a

serious way and calls for field inspection by appropriate, trained

inspectors.

<p>
We call upon the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in

cooperation with the Security Council, to give this important matter

the necessary attention, including looking into the possibilities of

the above-mentioned inspection.


<p>I should be grateful if you would arrange to have the text of this

letter distributed as an official document of the fifty-fifth session

of the General Assembly, under agenda items 40, 41 and 85, and of the

Security Council.
