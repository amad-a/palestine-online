<p><b>DESPITE CURRENT UNREST, ISRAEL LOOKS TO EXPAND
JERUSALEM SETTLEMENTS
</b></p>








<p>Yesterday, November 2, 2000, the Jerusalem municipality
discussed a
project for the construction of an additional 4,000 units in the Har
Homa settlement, near Bethlehem. To be named Har Homa "B",
these units
will be built on confiscated Palestinian land, as was the existing Har
Homa settlement.

<p>According to Ha'aretz newspaper, this project was presented to a
subcommittee of the local planning and construction committee
along
with plans for the private construction of 400 Jewish residential
units between Gilo and Har Homa, and the construction of a small
Jewish enclave near Palestinian Abu Dis.


<p>These projects, illegal under international law, come at an extremely
dangerous time as Israeli repression of Palestinians demonstrators
claims more and more victims each day. It must be fully understood
that the current situation is a direct result of the Israeli
occupation and the policies that Israel has carried out for the past
33 years, including the confiscation of Palestinian owned land for the
construction of Jewish only settlements, which ironically has
intensified since Oslo.

<p>The approval of these plans will only exacerbate the already deadly
situation in the Occupied Territories. Therefore we ask that people
write to those responsible for these decisions and demand that they
comply with their obligations as signatories to the Fourth Geneva
Convention and freeze immediately all plans to build more settlements
in East Jerusalem and its environs.
