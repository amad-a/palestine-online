<b>Israeli army continues violations in the Palestinian
Territories<br>
                              Fatah leader killed in West Bank</b>


<p>Forty-nine-year-old Thabet Thabet, Secretary General of Tulkarem's
Fatah branch was killed in the West Bank city yesterday morning.

<p>Palestinian eyewitnesses reported that at 9:30 am, an Israeli
military
unit hiding in a truck opened fire at Thabet as he reversed his car,
shooting him at least six times. He died in Tulkarem hospital at
10:30
am.
<p>
Eyewitnesses also reported that a nearby Israeli-registered car
sped
off after the attack and a military helicopter was hovering overhead.

<p>According to LAW's documentation, Thabet is the eighth Palestinian
victim of targeted assassination. The others were Hussein Abyat (37),
Jamal Abdul Razik (30), Ibraheem Bani Auda (34), Anwar Hamran (28),
Yusif Sawi (28), Abas Awiwi (26 ) and Hani Abu Bukra (32). According
to some commentators, these killings may well amount to extra judicial
executions, which is strictly prohibited under international law.
Further, some commentators have argued that the onus is on the Israeli
authorities to apprehend those they deem a risk to their security, and
not to resort to a policy that has as its rationale, intentional
physical elimination.

<p>At 5:00 am yesterday an Israeli military unit opened fire at a group
of Palestinian workers after the latter protested being searched in a
humiliating way. The injured were:

<p>Sa'id Al Harazin, 23, shot in the left knee,<br>
Mohammad Nasir, 23, shot in the left knee,<br>
Yasir Al Rantisi, 21, shot in the stomach,<br>
Salman Al Aruki, 37, shot in the head.<br>
Ambulance driver Ibraheem Shabat, 32, was also injured while trying to
rescue the wounded. He was shot in the left leg.

<p>Karar Shihada, 20, was shot in the head when a group of Israeli
soldiers opened fire at Palestinian civilians east of Al Braij refugee
camp in the Gaza Strip.

<p>Rafah also in the Gaza Strip, was bombed twice yesterday; first when
Israeli forces fired five artillery shells that hit barricades,
causing no damage or injury, then when they shelled Al Salam
residential area and wounded four Palestinians.

<p>LAW reiterates its call in the strongest terms to the High Contracting
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to act on their article 1 and
inter-state obligation and enforce the provisions of the convention.

<p>LAW notes the current negotiations, and urges states not to pressure
the PLO into accepting an agreement that may hamper the realization of
the rights of the Palestinian people as prescribed in public
international law. Any agreement must safeguard existing rights.

<p>LAW calls on Israel to implement forthwith U.N. resolution 242, 338
and 194.

<p><b> 
Can you feel their anger? </b></p>
 
<p>
By Rick Carter 

<p>It was 5:00 PM Thursday afternoon when I received a frantic phone call 
from Jowdy Jabber. Settlers were once again in his brother Atta's 
home, in the Beqa'a valley, east of Hebron. 

<p>The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) forced Atta to leave his home several 
weeks ago after a settler attack, and declared it a closed military 
zone. Soldiers are stationed there full time to keep settlers and 
Atta's family away. After Jowdy's call, we immediately called the 
Hebron police and learned the IDF had granted the settlers a one hour 
permit to hold a Hanukkah prayer service. Pierre Shantz and I 
immediately left to for the Jabber home. When we arrived, there were 
fires and candles burning all around the home and the settlers were 
dispersing. 

<p>As we watched from the porch of Atta's fathers home stones the size of 
softballs began crashing to the ground around us. The settlers were 
stoning the house from a 30 foot wall behind us. Ducking into the 
house for cover we called the Hebron police again to tell them of the 
attack and request assistance. We were told to go out and talk to the 
police across the street who are supervising the Hanukkah service. 
"That's not possible, we're under attack," we replied. Once the voice 
on the other end of the line decided that yes, it probably wasn't wise 
to leave the house, he dispatched police who stopped the stoning and 
came to the house to talk with the family. 

<p>The police assured us they were there to protect everyone, including 
Palestinians, offering their quick response as evidence of their 
protection. "What did you do with the settlers who were stoning," we 
asked. They were told to go home. (What happens to Palestinians who 
throw stones? They are shot.) "Why don't you make that 30 foot wall 
a closed military zone and keep settlers away?" We can't do that. 
They throw stones from there and attack this family every time there 
is violence against Israelis anywhere. This family is vocal about 
non-violence in the community and work closely with Israeli peace 
groups. "Why would the settlers even want to hold a service there if 
they didn't plan on claiming it? Why did you allow a prayer service at 
Atta's home if you don't plan to let them? You call this protection?" 
What if you were asking these questions about your home? Can you feel 
their anger? 

<p>The following morning on my way home I passed through a group of 
small boys, probably from eight to twelve years old. They looked 
mischievous. They possessed the smirk of just having done something 
they shouldn't have. The look that causes adults to be wary and look 
around for it's cause. Looking down the road I saw two soldiers, 
then eight more came running up. Ten heavily armed soldiers facing a 
group of unarmed boys. How would you feel if your local police 
responded to your children with lethal force? Can you feel their 
anger? 

<p>Later that day I was on my way to meet a friend for lunch. There was 
a clash between heavily armed Israeli youth (Israeli soldiers) and 
Palestinian youth armed with stones (Palestinian soldiers) in the 
street I was walking on, so I walked around it. But I got tear gassed 
anyway because the wind was blowing my direction. Cautiously looking 
down the street through my stinging and watering eyes, slinking across 
like some kind of fugitive, walking across the town square as close to 
the buildings as possible thinking about getting shot, the absurdity 
of the whole thing struck me. What if you had to do this just to go 
to lunch? Can you feel their anger? 

<p>This is a military occupation at the hand of a self proclaimed 
democracy, justified and supported by many other democracies around 
the world. These nations consistently turn a blind eye while the 
indigenous civilian population is brutalized, not only by the 
occupying military force but also by the occupier's civilian 
population who confiscate the land they are colonizing. This is a 
place where the civilian population is collectively punished in 
retaliation for resistance. This is a place where the occupying army 
seeks out and assassinates resistance leaders; where the occupiers who 
have guns and bombs are called soldiers and considered legitimate 
around the world, while those who resist with guns and bombs are 
considered criminal terrorists by the international community. 

<p>Can you feel their anger?
