<p><b>A Bloody day in the occupied Palestinian territories: 8 Palestinian civilians 
  are killed and hundreds are wounded by the Israeli occupation forces </b>
<p> Today, the Israeli occupation escalated 
  their aggressive actions against Palestinian demonstrators who demonstrated 
  in protest to the crimes and killings perpetrated by these forces in the occupied 
  Palestinian territories. In contrast with the claims of the Israeli political 
  circles and mass media, the last 48 hours witnessed additional reinforcement 
  of the Israeli occupation troops, and establishment of new military sites and 
  expansion of existing ones. It is worth mentioning that these military sites 
  are in direct friction with over-populated Palestinian areas, which increases 
  tension in these areas and constitutes a major factor of the continuity of clashes 
  between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces. <p>This afternoon, 
  the Israeli occupation forces fired at a peaceful demonstration which was organized 
  in Nablus in protest to the aggressive actions by the Israeli occupation forces 
  and Jewish settlers, who fired at some Palestinians yesterday and killed Zahi 
  Fathi El-A'arda, 34 years old, by a bullet in the abdomen. In the clashes of 
  this afternoon in Nablus, 4 Palestinian civilians were killed and 55 were wounded, 
  8 of whom are in a very critical condition, including the child Sae'd Tambour, 
  15 years old, who was wounded by a bullet in the head, and medical sources stated 
  that he is clinically dead. The four martyrs of Nablus are: 1. A'dnan Khairi 
  A'ziz Asa'd, 21 years old, wounded by a Dum-Dum bullet in the head; 2. Eissa 
  Abdullah Shteiwi, 32 years old, wounded by a medium bullet in the heart; 3. 
  Feras Khalil Mustafa Zeid, 26 years old, wounded by a medium bullet in the chest; 
  and 4. Amjad Ahmed Abu Eissa, 32 years old, wounded by a bullet in the chest. 
  <p>This afternoon too, in the town of Salfit the Israeli occupation forces fired 
  at Palestinian demonstrators and killed the child Alla' Bassam Abdullah Bani 
  Nemreh, 15 years old, by a bullet in the head. In Ramallah and Al-Bireh, the 
  Israeli occupation forces shot dead Thae'r Ali Daud Moa'lla, 20 years old, from 
  the refugee camp of Al-Ama'ri, by a bullet in the head, and wounded dozens of 
  civilians with live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets. In Qalqilya, 
  the Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian demonstrators and killed the 
  child Samer Talal Al-Oweisi, 16 years old, by a bullet in the chest, and wounded 
  dozens. In Tulkarm, the child Mohammed A'adel Ibrahim Abu Tahoun, 16 years old, 
  was killed by two bullets in the neck and the chest fired by the Israeli occupation 
  forces. This evening, the Israeli combat helicopters shelled some houses and 
  an electricity generator in Beit Sahour. As a result, electricity was cut off 
  in some quarters of the city. No casualties have been reported so far. In the 
  town of Rafah, clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation 
  forces are still continuous. <p>PCHR's field officer in Rafah has just reported 
  that the Israeli occupation forces unleashed two shells at houses in the area 
  adjacent to the borders with Egypt. It is worth mentioning that these houses 
  were evacuated of their residents due to frequent aggressive actions by the 
  Israeli occupation forces. During the past three weeks, this area was shelled 
  by the Israeli occupation forces several times, the last of them was last night 
  when these forces unleashed 6 shells. The Israeli occupation forces have used 
  live ammunition, rubber-coated bullets, tear gas and even shells indiscriminately 
  against Palestinian civilians in Rafah. PCHR's field officer in the town reported 
  that 15 Palestinian civilians were wounded by live ammunition shot by the Israeli 
  occupation forces, including the child Ibrahim Zannoun, 13 years old, who was 
  wounded in the foot, and Nazek Mohammed Qeshta, 32 years old, who was wounded 
  by splinters of a shell in the eye and hand. <p>In Khan Yunis, clashes between 
  Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces near an Israeli 
  military outpost to the west of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis are still continuous. 
  PCHR's field officer in the area reported that more than 135 Palestinians, mostly 
  children, were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets, and 5 people were wounded 
  by live ammunition as a result of indiscriminate shooting by the Israeli occupation 
  forces. The PCHR's field officer added that the journalist Abdel Rahman Al-Khatib, 
  a photographer of Al-Ayyam local daily newspaper, was wounded by a rubber-coated 
  metal bullet in the face.<p> In addition, dozens of Palestinian civilians were 
  hurt due to inhaling tear gas used by the Israeli occupation forces. Today also, 
  the vicinity of the settlement of Kfar Darom near Deir El-Balah, witnessed clashes 
  between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces, which responded 
  shooting rubber-coated metal bullets. As a result, two Palestinians were wounded. 
  The area of Erez in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation 
  forces fired at Palestinian demonstrators this afternoon. As a result, Jalal 
  Yssin Hmeida, 16 years old, from Gaza, was wounded by 3 bullets in the chest, 
  shoulder and arm. He was evacuated to Shifa' Hospital in Gaza. PCHR's field 
  officer in the area reported that 4 other Palestinians were wounded by rubber-coated 
  metal bullets.<p> PCHR is deeply worried about the escalation of excessive use 
  of power by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians, this 
  afternoon in particular. PCHR warns that more killings may be perpetrated by 
  the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians in light of reinforcing 
  the presence of these forces throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, 
  in contrast with the claims of the Israeli mass media that these forces decreased 
  the points of friction.

<p> In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation forces reinforced 
  their presence in several areas and took some aggressive steps by: <ol>

<li>Establishing 
  a new military site at the road leading to Kissufim Crossing. 

<li> Deploying tanks, 
  vehicles and troops along the main road of the Gaza Strip, as if they were going 
  to reoccupy the Gaza Strip.

<li> The use of silencers, and the excessive use of 
  rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas against Palestinian civilians and houses 
  near points of clashes. 

<li> The use of shells which became a systematic policy 
  during the past two days, for instance the town of Rafah was shelled last night 
  and today. 

<li>Sweeping some agricultural areas adjacent to Israeli military 
  sites and settlements. 

<li>Continuing to impose a total siege on the Gaza Strip, 
  as all border crossings are still closed, except for Gaza International Airport 
  which was reopened yesterday.</ol>


<p> PCHR reiterates its call upon the international 
  community and the High Contracting Parties to Geneva Fourth Convention for immediate 
  intervention to halt the crimes and killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
  forces, which have resulted in killing 105 Palestinians, including 27 children 
  under 18, and wounding more than 3,000, one third of whom are children. PCHR 
  believes that providing immediate international protection for Palestinian civilians 
  in the occupied Palestinian territories is the only way to stop the crimes perpetrated 
  by the Israeli occupation forces, and prevent more deterioration of the situation.

<b>Israel Continues Heavy Artillery Assault Against Palestinian Civilians </b>
<p> Israeli occupation forces continue to use missiles, helicopter gunships, tanks 
  and other heavy weapons against Palestinians and their homes in Nablus, Tulkarem, 
  Qalqilya, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Rafah and Khan Younis, resulting in 8 deaths 
  and at least 275 injuries. Israeli occupation forces opened fire on Palestinian 
  civilians at Kufar Khalil Junction, near Tulkarem, on the Nablus-Jerusalem road. 
  This resulted in four deaths: 
<ol>
<li>Feras Khalil Mustafa Zaid, 26 years old from Nablus, 
  bullet in the chest. <li>Amjad Ahmad Akram Abu A'isa, 32 years old from Kufar 
  Khalil village, bullet in the chest. <li>Atnan Keri Aziz Asad, 21 years old from 
  Ballata camp, a bullet in the head. <li>Isa Abdullah Shtawi Fa'ul, 32 years old 
  from Ballata camp, bullet in the heart. </ol>


<p>At the same location 35 were injured, 
  some of them severely, including Said Adnan Abdullah Tambour, 15 years, who 
  is clinically dead after he was hit by live ammunition in the head. Israeli 
  snipers shot at Palestinian civilians in Tulkarem and Qalqilya, killing two 
  youths. They were Muhammed Aidel Hassan Abu Tahum, 16 years old from Tulkarem, 
  hit by two bullets in the neck and chest and Samer Tallal Awasi, 16 years old 
  from Qalqilya, hit by live ammunition in the chest. This brings the number of 
  Palestinians killed by Israeli occupation forces and settlers since 28 October 
  2000 to 108.


<p> In Rafah, Israeli occupation forces continued to fire with heavy 
  weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles, into residential areas, injuring 
  55. In Khan Younis, 135 people were injured after live ammunition and missiles 
  were fired by Israeli occupation forces near El Matehan Junction. Most were 
  injured by live ammunition and shrapnel from the missiles. In Nablus, an Israeli 
  soldier fired on a Palestinian bus passing between Tal Village and Surah Village, 
  injuring the Abu Kaud family. One of the children, Arif, 2 years old, was hit 
  in his left leg. His mother, Ahlam, was hit in her leg and right arm. <p>Israeli 
  tanks stationed east of Beit Sahour and at the western entrance of Beit Jala, 
  along with two Israeli helicopter gunships, fired upon Palestinian neighborhoods 
  in Beit Jala, Beit Sahour and Za'atera village, causing damage to numerous homes 
  and cars and damaging the main electricity transmitter at Beit Sahour, causing 
  an electricity blackout to the Bethlehem region. At the time of writing, 8.00pm 
  Friday, Israeli artillery continues to fire at residential areas in Rafah, near 
  Salah El Din Gate, and at Beit Sahour, Beit Jala and Nablus. <p>
Israeli forces 
  are also preventing the return of farmers to their homes in Kufar Khalil, Huwara, 
  Beit Dajan and villages in Salfit. LAW reiterates the following:<ul>


<li>The Israeli 
  government is fully responsible for situation that has developed in the Occupied 
  Territories and the violence committed against Palestinian civilians. <li>LAW 
  demands that those responsible for this aggression against Palestinians be investigated 
  and brought to trial.

<li> We demand that the United National Security Council 
  take immediate action to protect Palestinians civilians and force Israel to 
  comply with articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention. </ul>

<b>

LAW Welcomes Human Rights Commission's Resolution for an Inquiry</b>



<p>Yesterday, 19 October 2000, a Special Session of the Commission on 
Human
Rights passed a resolution condemning what it said were "grave and 
massive
violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel", 
and
decided to establish a "human rights inquiry commission" to gather
information with the aim of preventing similar occurrences.

<p>In resolution E/CN.4/S-5/L.2/Rev.1 on grave and massive violations of 
the
human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the Commission 
strongly
condemned the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in 
violation
of international law by the Israeli occupying power against innocent 
unarmed
Palestinian civilians, causing the deaths of 120 civilians, including 
many
children, in the occupied territories, which constituted a war crime 
and a
crime against humanity; called upon Israel to put an immediate end to 
any
use of force against unarmed civilians; and called upon the 
international
community to take immediate effective measures to secure the cessation 
of
violence by Israel and to put an end to the ongoing violations of the 
human
rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.

<p>The resolution affirmed that the Israeli occupation in itself 
constituted a
grave violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people; also 
affirmed
that the deliberate and systematic killing of civilians and children by
Israel constituted a flagrant and grave violation of the right to life 
and a
crime against humanity; and decided to establish a human rights inquiry
commission whose membership should be based on the principles of
independence and objectivity, to gather and compile information on the
violation of human rights by Israel in the occupied Palestinian 
territories
and to provide the Commission with its conclusions and recommendations, 
with
the aim of preventing a repetition of such violations

<p>In addition, the measure requested Commission Special Rapporteurs on
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; torture; violence 
against
women; religious intolerance; racial discrimination; and right to 
housing;
its Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; and the
Representative of the Secretary-General for internally displaced 
persons to
carry out immediate missions to the occupied Palestinian territories 
and to
report their findings to the Commission at its fifty-seventh session 
and, on
an interim basis, to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.

<p>Law welcomes this as the only fair and impartial means to examine into 
the
human rights violations since 28 September 2000. The evidence of 
reliable
and independent international observers has shown that Israel used 
force
illegally and flagrantly violated the rights of Palestinians. Law asks 
all
States to submit to the democratic vote of the Commission, and to 
facilitate
and support the work of the human rights inquiry into recent events. 
The
resolution was adopted by a vote of 19 in favour and 16 opposed, with 
17
abstaining.

<p>LAW attended the Special Session along with a number of other local and
international human rights organizations. It called for such a 
commission of
inquiry and asked for UN human rights Special Rapporteurs to visit the
occupied Palestinian territory to support the work of such a 
commission.

  <b> IOCC Initiates Emergency Response to Victims of Violence in the Holy Land 
</b>
<p> BALTIMORE (IOCC) - Victims of the crisis that began three weeks ago in the 
  Holy Land will receive emergency assistance through a project announced by International 
  Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) today. IOCC will deliver emergency medical 
  supplies, food and other relief aid valued at $20,000 to children and families 
  affected by the turmoil in East Jerusalem, Ramallah, the West Bank and Gaza 
  beginning next week. More than 1,500 people will benefit from the emergency 
  supplies that will be distributed through seven hospitals and community organizations. 
  Over 3,600 people have been injured in the hostilities that began September 
  28 with casualties mounting each day that the fighting continues. Many of the 
  injuries, according to IOCC Jerusalem Representative Nora Kort, have resulted 
  in head, neck and chest trauma. Tragically, many of the injuries have resulted 
  in permanent disabilities, she reports. 
<p>    The St. John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem, which has seen 
patients seeking treatment for eye injuries, is one of the institutions 
that will
  receive assistance from the IOCC project.  Mr. Marwan Khader, the 
Hospital's Administrative Director, described the needs of over 20 
young 
people who have sought treatment-including some who have lost their 
sight 
and another patient requiring an eye transplant.
       "We appeal to the conscience of the world to help us alleviate 
the
  suffering of these innocent people," said His Eminence, Metropolitan 
Philip, Primate of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of 
North 
America. "It pains me beyond measure to witness the ongoing uncivil war 
in 
Palestine and Israel.  Please pray for peace in the Middle East," the 
Metropolitan added.
   <p>    In addition to those injured, the disturbances have begun to 
exact an
  economic toll on the population of the Holy Land, with many Israeli 
and
  Palestinian businesses forced to close and tourism, a mainstay of the
  economy, dramatically curtailed.  The fighting has also come during 
the
  annual olive harvest that is a central cash crop for many Palestinian 
towns
  and villages.   Even if efforts to restore the peace are successful, 
with
  the violence preventing many Palestinians from harvesting the olive 
crop,
  the effects of the skirmishes are sure to be felt for months if not 
years
  ahead.
       To this end, IOCC will also work with partners in the region to 
provide
  direct assistance to families and the elderly who have been adversely
  affected and are in need of assistance.  Emergency provision of food,
  personal care items and medical supplies will be distributed in the 
West
  Bank.
      <p> IOCC is appealing for donations to provide emergency medical 
supplies, food and other relief aid. To make a contribution, visit the 
IOCC 
website at www.iocc.org or call toll-free (877) 803 4622.  Gifts to the 
"Holy Land Crisis Relief Project" may also be sent to IOCC, P.O. Box 
630225, Baltimore, MD 21263-0225.
<p>       IOCC, the relief and development organization of Orthodox 
Christians
  worldwide, began working in Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1997.  In
  addition to the emergency relief effort, IOCC implements projects in
  education, computer training, small-enterprise development and the
  rehabilitation of schools in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  
Despite
  difficult working conditions and restricted travel, IOCC staff 
continue to
  implement the school rehabilitation and training projects.

SPECIAL SESSION OF COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ESTABLISHES INQUIRY
COMMISSION INTO ISRAELI 'ABUSES' IN OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES 
<br>
Resolution Urges High Commissioner for Human Rights, Special 
Rapporteurs to
Visit Occupied Palestinian Territories 
</b>
<p>GENEVA, 19 October () -- A special session of the
Commission on Human Rights condemned this evening by a margin of three
roll-call votes what it said were "grave and massive violations of the
human rights of the Palestinian people by Israel", and decided to 
establish
a "human rights inquiry commission" to gather information with the aim 
of
preventing similar occurrences. 

<p>A resolution to that effect was adopted by a vote of 19 in favour and 
16
opposed, with 17 abstaining. 

<p>The resolution also requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to
visit the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel, to take stock of 
the
situation after what it called "disproportionate and indiscriminate use 
of
force" by Israel in the course of confrontations beginning on 28 
September
that had led to the deaths of 120 civilians, including children. The 
High
Commissioner, Mary Robinson, was also asked to facilitate the 
activities of
Commission mechanisms in response to the events. 

<p>In addition, the resolution requested Commission Special Rapporteurs on
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; torture; violence 
against
women; religious intolerance; racial discrimination; the right to 
housing;
the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; and the
Representative of the Secretary-General for internally displaced 
persons to
carry out immediate missions to the occupied Palestinian territories 
and to
report their findings to the Commission at its fifty-seventh session 
and,
on an interim basis, to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth 
session. 

<p>The High Commissioner for Human Rights urged all parties to refrain 
from
words or actions that could exacerbate the current dangerous and 
sensitive
situation. She hoped all parties could soon succeed in halting all the
violence and would soon resume progress towards achieving lasting 
peace. 

<p>Shambu Ram Simhkada, the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, 
said
that the only way forward was through the process of dialogue and
discussion. He believed that in that sense, the session had made a
contribution. 

<p>A representative of Palestine said passage of the resolution had "saved 
the
reputation of human rights", which had been "repressed, suppressed,
trampled upon, even killed, in Palestine".

<b>STATEMENT ON THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS
</b> 

<p>We are pained and outraged at the carnage in the Middle East, which has 
now
claimed over one hundred lives, overwhelmingly Palestinian.  While 
every
death must be mourned, there is absolutely no moral equivalence between
Israel's use of its heavy weapons and advanced sniper equipment against
largely unarmed civilians.  No rationalization or media spin can 
justify
this one-sided use of force, unprecedented in the history of the 
region, to
vanquish stone-throwers.

<p>WE DEMAND:
<ol>
<li>The US Administration must urgently prevail upon Israel to honor a 
cease
fire, pull back its troops from confrontation points, and end the 
massacre
that its armed forces have been carrying out.

<p>The United States is Israel's one and only patron.  There is no way 
Israel
can resist even a minimal exertion of US will.  In 1998 Israel received 
$2.8
billion in economic aid, more than any other country.

<li>In view of the now-obvious failure of the US-brokered Oslo peace 
process,
the focus of mediation between Israel and the Palestinians must 
promptly
revert to the United Nations and be carried out according to the terms 
of
the new Security Council resolution (no. 1322, adopted October 7), 
which
incorporates relevant earlier resolutions.

<p>The Oslo Peace Accords were signed by Israel and the PLO in September 
1993
after being negotiated secretly under Norwegian auspices.  The Accords 
did
begin a needed dialogue, but were fatally undermined when the United 
States
assumed control over the negotiations.  This contributed to a long term
process whereby the US has been drawing responsibility for Middle East
issues out of the hands of the UN, the international authority whose 
Partition
Resolution of 1947 had provided for two states to be set up in 
Palestine.
The Oslo Accords postponed into the indefinite future implementation of 
UN
Resolutions 242 and 338.  Adopted in 1967 and 1973, these resolutions 
called
unambiguously for Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territories 
it
had occupied in 1967.  The new Security Council resolution reaffirms 
these older
resolutions as the basis for "a just and lasting solution" of the 
conflict.

<p>The Oslo Accords were adopted by negotiating partners severely unequal 
in
power.  Washington did nothing to maintain a balance in the 
negotiations.
This was to prove disastrous for peace; the Israeli Right was 
emboldened to
warp the negotiations so that the prospects for a sovereign Palestinian
state withered.  The final outcome was intact Israeli control over 
vanquished
Palestinians, who were to have limited "self rule" within an area 
carved by
Israeli roads and surrounded by Israeli settlements.  The Palestinians 
were
left with no state, no capital in East Jerusalem, no adequate access to
water and no right of return for refugees who had been expelled.  The 
frustration,
humiliation and anger wrought by unemployment, expulsions, home 
demolitions
and jailings without trial under the occupation finally burst on 
September
28.  On that day, Ariel Sharon, organizer a generation earlier of the
massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, was allowed by the 
Barak
leadership to venture with over 1,000 armed police onto Haram al 
Sharif, an
Islamic holy place, to emphasize Israel's claimed sovereignty over all
Jerusalem.  And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, alone among 
world
leaders, was unable to condemn this action or comprehend the explosion 
of
anger by the Palestinians.

<li> There must be an international investigation.  On October 9 Amnesty
International called on the UN to "establish urgently an independent
international investigation, to include criminal justice experts known 
for
their impartiality and integrity, to investigate all killings of 
civilians
that took place since 29 September in Israel, the Occupied territories 
and
South Lebanon."  In the context of strong support, we also urge that 
the
scope of the investigation be enlarged to include responsibility for 
the
crisis as a whole.
</ol>
<p>Finding the truth is essential for ending the conflict and bringing 
peace
with justice to the peoples of the region.  Accordingly, the emergency

past, is not a
fit arbiter in the new situation.

<h3>American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee</h3>
<b>Need for International Protection for Palestinians
Now Beyond Question
</b>
<p>Washington, DC, October 20 -- The nation's largest Arab-American
membership organization, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 
Committee
(ADC), today urgently reiterated its call on the international 
community
to act immediately to protect Palestinians living under Israeli
occupation in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.  According to
western journalists, today Israeli troops and helicopter gunships in
several occupied cities opened fire "absolutely without restraint"
against Palestinian demonstrators  leaving at least 6 dead, including
several children.  Given recent findings of the UN Security Council and
Human Rights Commission and the increasing use of deadly force against
Palestinian civilians, the international community must act now to
provide protection to this besieged and denfenseless population.

<p>Yesterday, the UN Human Rights Commission voted to condemn Israel for
``widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights'' and set
up an international inquiry into Israel's brutal suppression of 
protests
against its 33 year occupation.  The Commission strongly condemned 
``the
indiscriminate use of force in violation of international humanitarian
law by the Israeli occupying power'' during its crackdown in the
occupied Palestinian territories.  Amnesty International has also
condemned the "excessive use of lethal force" by Israel and said that
"impunity for those who commit human rights violations and the lack of
investigations into so many deaths at the hands of the [Israeli]
security forces has led to a breakdown in the rule of law."  On October
7, the UN Security Council condemned "acts of violence, especially the
excessive use of force against Palestinians, resulting in injury and
loss of human life" and "called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to
abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities
under the Fourth Geneva Convention ."

<p>During more than three weeks of intense violence, over one hundred
people have been killed, almost all of them unarmed Palestinians.
Although Israel has already been using exceptionally extreme measures
against Palestinian demonstrators, including indiscriminate gunfire,
tanks, rockets, helicopter gunships and the bombing of cities,
circumstances strongly suggest that the civilian Palestinian population
of the occupied territories are in ever greater danger from attacks by
the Israeli military.

<p>ADC President Hala Maksoud said "The international community has now
recognized the obvious fact that Israel is killing Palestinian 
civilians
under its occupation in a brutal and unjustifiable manner.  The world
cannot simply stand by and allow an unarmed and defenseless people to 
be
massacred by one of the world's most powerful armies.  The 
international
community, especially our own government, and the United Nations, must
act now to protect Palestinians from further attacks by the Israeli
army.  We have a clear obligation to intervene when a civilian
population, including children, living under a recognized military
occupation are being gunned down in the streets.  Israel must not be
allowed to kill a single further Palestinian child, and the Israeli
occupation, which is only being maintained by this uncontrolled 
violence
must be swiftly brought to an end."

<h3>"Interfaith Week For Peace in the Middle East" Planned</h3>



<p>Washington, DC—Today, Peace Action announced that, working with allied
peace and religious groups, it will organize a week of vigils, 
interfaith
services and email campaigns to President Clinton, Prime Minister 
Barak,
and Chairman Arafat, calling for a complete cease-fire in Israel and
Palestine, UN mediation, and a cut-off of U.S. arms shipments to Israel
and the Arab nations [see attached Call].

<p>"From Sunday to Sunday, October 22-29, our activists will work with 
people
of goodwill and friends in the faith communities, to make visible the 
deep
desire for a just peace in the Middle East," said Van Gosse, Peace
Action's Organizing Director.  "Americans have a special 
responsibility,
because we are not neutral parties in this conflict.  Israel is one of 
the
largest recipients of U.S. military aid in the world.  Israeli troops 
are
using American-made M-16 automatic rifles."

<p>In Seattle, Boston and many cities and towns in-between, Peace Action
activists will mobilize.  While the Muslim and Arab-American community 
has
been rallying for a peaceful solution over the past weeks in response 
to
the fighting, this is the first nationally-coordinated effort by the 
U.S.
peace movement.  "The terrible conflict in Israel and Palestine has 
been a
difficult issue for organizations like ours in the past," noted Gosse.
"But our National Board made up of grassroots activists across the 
country
feels strongly that we cannot remain silent.  Large numbers of 
Palestinian
civilians, as well as Jewish and Arab Israelis, and soldiers and 
policemen
on both sides, have been killed or injured.  Whether it's the Israeli
soldiers killed in Ramallah, or the more than twenty Palestinian 
children
killed by Israeli fire, it's wrong, and it's a direct result of U.S.
policies of supporting and exporting militarism."

<p>From 1992 to 1999, the U.S. shipped almost $42 billion in arms to the
Middle East, including $8.3 billion worth to Egypt, $7.4 billion to
Israel, and an astonishing $20.4 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia.  
"How can we possibly claim to be peace-makers, when we're keeping the
whole region armed to the teeth?" asked Gosse.

<p>In New York city, Peace Action has joined with others, including the
Quaker UN Representative, the Ribbons Project, and PeaceLinks, to 
organize
daily women's vigils across from the UN in support of peace and
reconciliation, starting on the afternoon of October 19.  "As the 
Security
Council debates the issue, we want to support Israeli and Palestinian
women in the Middle East who are reaching out to each other," said 
Peace
Action UN Representative Shirley Chesney.  "We'll be outside the UN at 
10
AM on Monday, and every day, until we're back on track to bring a just 
and
dignified peace to the region, and the killing stops."

<p>Peace Action, formerly SANE/Freeze, is the nation's largest peace,
disarmament and social justice organization, with 27 state affiliates 
and
70,000 members.  For more information, visit our website at

<p><b>PNGO Network:</b></p>
<p><b>PALESTINIAN NGOs PROTEST VIOLATIONS OF PALESTINIANS' RIGHT TO SECURITY AND 
  INSIST THAT NO LASTING PEACE WILL BE REACHED UNTIL SETTLEMENTS ARE COMPLETELY 
  DISMANTLED</b></p>
<p> In light of the recent escalation of violence and killing in the Palestinian 
  Occupied Territories and Autonomous Areas (including Jerusalem), the Palestinian 
  Network of Non-Governmental Organizations (PNGO) wishes to express its grave 
  concern and sorrow over recent events which have left the Palestinian population 
  feeling terrorized, helpless and insecure. </p>
<p>Responsibility for these developments lies upon the state of Israel, which 
  has acted in violation of its duty to conform to international standards of 
  conduct in regard to Palestinian civilians. Over the past two weeks, over 90 
  people have been killed and around 3000 injured, almost all of whom Palestinian 
  and, many, children. The perpetrators of these murderous acts have been mostly 
  Israeli occupation soldiers and armed Israeli civilians.</p>
<p> The fact that Israeli troops have used excessive force in contravention of 
  international law has been recognized and condemned by the international community 
  in UN Security Council Resolution 1322, adopted on 7 October 2000. However, 
  of equal or even greater concern to us is the rise of violence being carried 
  out against Palestinian civilians by Israeli settler civilians in the Occupied 
  Territories? </p>
<p>Israeli civilian violence: Since the night of 7 October 2000, gangs of settlers 
  have been attacking Palestinian towns, villages, automobiles, schools, homes 
  and shops, often under the cover of darkness, throwing rocks, shooting live 
  ammunition and setting firebombs. Particularly disturbing was the case of Isam 
  Hamad Judeh, 36, from the village of Um Safa, who was found dead on 9 October 
  near Pisgot settlement. Evidence suggests that he was tortured to death. Heartbreaking 
  was the case of Sara Abdul Haq, an 18-month old baby girl from Nablus who was 
  shot dead by a settler while sitting on her mother's lap. The perpetrator of 
  this crime was shooting at Palestinian cars passing through Za'atara junction 
  near the settlements of Elon Moreh and Ariel. Other members of the victim's 
  family were also injured in the attack. In almost all cases of settler attacks, 
  Israeli security forces have done little to nothing to protect Palestinian victims. 
  Indeed, in many cases, police and soldiers have sided with rioting settlers, 
  turning their gunfire on unarmed Palestinians trying to defend their homes and 
  property.</p>
<p> A history of illegal activity: As of last year, Israel was maintaining 158 
  settlements in the West Bank, at least 16 in East Jerusalem and 19 in Gaza, 
  with a total settler population of approximately 364,000. The impact of settlements 
  has been disastrous for Palestinians, fracturing the territorial integrity of 
  their lands, altering the demographic makeup, exploiting scarce water resources 
  and generally frustrating hopes of establishing a viable Palestinian state. 
  The construction and expansion of Jewish colonies on occupied territory in the 
  West Bank and Gaza strip have been illegal, under international humanitarian 
  law, from their inception. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states 
  unequivocally: "The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its 
  own civilian population into the territory it occupies." Moreover, the international 
  community has repeatedly denounced Israeli settlement policy. Twice in 1979, 
  1980 and again in 1994 the UN Security Council expressed concern over illegal 
  Israeli construction in the Occupied Territories as an obstacle to peace. </p>
<p>A threat to Palestinian security: Violent attacks by vigilante settlers against 
  Palestinians are not new. But the recent escalation of conflict has also seen 
  a rise in Israeli civilian violence. As a result, the Palestinian population 
  of the West Bank and Gaza Strip currently finds itself under siege, facing serious 
  violations of their right to security. While Israel has retained all functions 
  of authority over the Palestinian Territories at its own insistence, its continuing 
  violation of its duty to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians under occupation 
  cannot be justified by any plausible reason of military necessity. Both the 
  UN Security Council as well as independent, international observers concur that 
  during the events of these days, Israel has failed to conform to international 
  standards of acceptable conduct. Israel claims that a primary reason for establishing 
  settlements has been to ensure "security" but the exact opposite has been effected. 
  By constructing and populating Jewish colonies with armed, often fanatical residents, 
  and by failing to ensure the security of Palestinian civilians, Israel has nourished 
  a climate ripe for conflict and the perpetration of crimes against Palestinians.</p>
<p> In light of the above, PNGO demand:</p>
<p> That Israel comply with articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention obliging 
  it to ensure the security and protection of the Palestinian civilian population; 
</p>
<p>That High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions fulfil their OBLIGATION 
  to ensure compliance with the treaty by using all reasonable means to force 
  Israel to guarantee the security of Palestinian civilians; </p>
<p>That in the absence of adequate measures taken by Israel or by High Contracting 
  Parties, the UN Security Council take direct action to ensure the protection 
  of Palestinian civilians; </p>
<p>That Israel apprehend and prosecute its civilians who carry out acts of terror 
  and violence against Palestinian civilians. PNGO Network 18 October 2000 Jerusalem,

<h3>ARCI</h3>
<p><b>Message to Palestine</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p> In the last 20 days we have been following the news from Palestine with a 
  growing sense of anxiety and dismay. From 1989 we activated together with different 
  communities, NGOs and many communities projects supporting Palestinian Children 
  in their communities, in the hope that your Children may go back to play and 
  we hope that no soldier of an occupying country may make an attempt on their 
  lives. </p>
<p>We have witnessed important changes in these years and we have shared moments 
  of joy in Palestine with the resumption of peaceful life in the families, in 
  the villages, in the communities. After the Oslo agreements we had shared with 
  you the hope that peace could be one with justice and law. But we had already 
  had the possibility of observing and understanding the reasons of a possible 
  rebellion, and then it was clear to us the revolt was on the way even before 
  Sharon’s shameful provocation. What we witnessed was in fact a truce rather 
  than peace, with the suspension of fights together with the slow and hard building 
  up of an autonomous State of Palestine. It was sufficient to look outside the 
  window, to live in a refugee camp or to go just a few yards outside a village 
  or a town to understand that peace was far-away: road blocks and sub-machine-guns 
  and Israeli soldiers’ Jeeps and "by-pass roads" and again and again the provocation 
  of the settlements and the arrogance of the settlers and the humiliating waiting 
  at the check points.</p>
<p> We also witnessed the deny of Palestinian Rights: the right to East Jerusalem, 
  the Refugees’ right to Return, the right to the land and to the borders for 
  a Palestinian State, which also means stopping the settlements and dismantling 
  them by degrees. These are the substantial demands for any future talks and 
  for the building up of peace. The last 20 days of uprising of Palestinians, 
  people, young people and Children against the denial of human rights and of 
  International law, aimed at denouncing the inconclusiveness of a peace process 
  in fact worn-out. The criminal reaction from Israel, that is indiscriminate 
  slaying as the expression of that strength and arrogance which is merely contemptuous 
  of the agreements previously signed. Israel's military forces have been using 
  lethal ammunition since the first day of the conflict, and are targeting civilians', 
  using war instruments including tanks and helicopter gunshots, against unarmed 
  or lightly armed Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p>Clearly, this implies that soldiers have been given "shoot to kill" orders, 
  a contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The danger and the threats 
  posed by the Israeli Army the Jewish settlers whom indiscriminately attaching 
  the center cars while carrying the children prevented the ambulances from carrying 
  out their mission, and we know that in Al Fawwar Refugee Camp, where we are 
  running a project together with the Community of the camp, this caused definitively 
  the death of the young Palestinian, Shadi Elwawi, shot by Israeli Army. We know 
  that the same is happening in all other realities in Palestine. </p>
<p>The rights and needs of Palestinian refugees' rights must be considered no 
  different than any other refugee group under the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention. 
  As we wrote in a appeal to Mrs. Mary Robinson UN High Commissioner for Human 
  Rights "unlike all other refugee groups in the world today, Palestinians—the 
  world's largest and oldest refugee population--are not accorded legal protection 
  under existing International conventions, nor by the United Nations High Commission 
  for Refugees (UNHCR). Furthermore, Israel has consistently refused to recognise 
  its obligations under the Geneva Conventions, particularly those clauses that 
  protect civilians under military occupation". </p>
<p>Nobody has the right to ask Palestinian people to stop protesting and to appease 
  their revolt until their rights are denied and their country is occupied. We 
  hope that the International Community may vouch for your rights and your safety 
  and above all find the way to let Israel understand that the rules of internationals 
  law are the same for everybody. Our whole NGO, ARCI at national level, the regional 
  committees, local committees and groups are trying their best, together with 
  other NGO active on Palestine and other democratic groups organising mobilisation 
  in Italy. We have been trying to tell people in our country about all this. 
  Unfortunately, we don’t have any slots on national media broadcasts and we don’t 
  have any power to influence the official press which, with a few exceptions, 
  keeps on looking for an "equidistant" position, as if there was no military 
  occupation at all in the last 30 years. We are anyhow trying to pass on a different 
  kind of information, reminding people about the Palestinian right to East Jerusalem, 
  the Refugees’ Right to Return, the right to the land and to the borders for 
  a Palestinian State, which also means stopping the settlements and dismantling 
  them by degrees. </p>
<p>These are the substantial demands for any future talks and for the building 
  up of peace. Undoubtedly, what we do is surely not much. Our activities are 
  not sufficient in relation to the needs and to the responsibility that everybody 
  feels. Sometimes we really feel powerless. Though, we can’t give up. And we 
  don’t want to. And on these subjects we have proposed motions and made repeated 
  requests of support to our town councils; besides we have organised demonstrations 
  in favour of a stronger role that Italy and Europe may have to support internationals 
  protection for Palestinian people. We have been repeating over and over again 
  these days that we are directly concerned for the situation in Palestine. </p>
<p>The situation is one of greater difficulty and of course we want to offer our 
  solidarity and reassert our commitment and our unreserved support. We want to 
  be near you, so, please let us have news and opinions: do not hesitate to use 
  us through our representative in Palestine, Marco Grazia, or, if needed, directly 
  relating to the Italian offices of ARCI (see headed paper for co-ordinators), 
  so as to let other people know your reasons. Our commitment in Palestine as 
  Italian NGO, and as individuals, and our common action together, in order to 
  affirm the rights of the children in their Community, must be continued strongly 
  than before. </p>
<p>We hope that your Children may go back to play and we hope that no soldier 
  of an occupying country may make an attempt on their lives. In July 1988 we 
  activated a project supporting Palestinian Children and people. With SALAM CHILDREN 
  OF THE OLIVE TREE we had chosen to support you with concrete facts so that Palestinian 
  Children could grow up freely in their country. Even if the ways of intervention 
  have changed in these years, we think that our actions must still have the same 
  purpose: TOGETHER WITH PALESTINIAN CHILDREN, SO THAT THEY MAY GROW UP FREELY 
  IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. </p>
