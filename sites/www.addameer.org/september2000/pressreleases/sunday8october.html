<B>AL-HAQ CALLS FOR THE DISBANDING OF ISRAELI ‘SPECIAL UNITS’ CARRYING OUT SUMMARY 
EXECUTIONS IN THE ISRAELI-OCCUPIED TERRITORIES</B> 
<p>On Friday 6 October 2000, one Palestinian was wounded and one killed by Israeli 
  ‘Undercover Units’ at Al-Haram Al-Sharif in yet another case of willful and 
  unjustified killing amounting to summary execution. 
<p>According to al-Haq’s investigation into the incident, al-Haq has learned through 
  affidavits that the Israeli Occupying Forces have an undercover unit working 
  with them in the area of Al-Aksa. Kamel Amer Idkadek, 21, indicated in an affidavit 
  this past Friday that just before ‘evening’ prayer he was approached and shot 
  by what he thought were fellow Muslims coming for prayer. Kamel indicated that 
  he and other youths were preparing for prayer by washing themselves when a group 
  of masked men wearing all black with Islamic writing on there hoods greeted 
  them with typical evening Arabic pleasantries. As Kamel turned to respond, one 
  of the masked men shot him in the thigh. As he lay bleeding, another man in 
  the group told him not to shoot Kamel again with a live bullet but to use a 
  rubber coated bullet. The masked man then shot Kamel again, the second time 
  with a rubber bullet. Eyewitness accounts indicate that there were only 100 
  persons there for prayer in a very calm atmosphere with not a single person 
  throwing rocks. Even so, this undercover unit approached the small group of 
  youths preparing for prayer backed by a heavy showing of Israeli soldiers. Several 
  witnesses also indicated to al-Haq that the event occurred past 5 p.m. when 
  demonstrations and the atmosphere of the Friday morning prayer had long finished. 
  Members of the medical staff at Al-Aksa also reported that the assailants attacked 
  them. 
<p>Earlier, on the same Friday that Kamel Amer Idkadek was shot, similar undercover 
  units killed Majdi Samir Masslamani, 15, from Beit Hanina village. Eyewitness 
  indicated that Majdi was also shot by an undercover unit disguised as Muslim 
  coming to pray. After being shot, Majdi was seen alive and being handcuffed 
  by the undercover unit. It was only later that Majdi was discovered killed. 
  While still alive, bullets where fired at the ambulance that was attempting 
  to rescue Majdi. 
<p>The summary execution of Majdi Masslamani and the intentional shooting of Kamel 
  Idkadek is typical work of the special units. There purpose is to assassinate 
  ‘wanted’ or armed Palestinians without attempting to arrest them or bring them 
  to justice in accordance with the law. Al-haq is convinced, particularly as 
  a result of general reports concerning instructions issued to the special units 
  that there has been a recent escalation in the activity of these units as they 
  have begun shooting unarmed civilians. The danger of using undercover units 
  is multiplied when Israel already deploys a large number of police and other 
  security in the same area. In the past they have been shot and killed by other 
  Israeli Occupying entities. 
<p>Willful killing, used by the special units and the Israeli Occupying Forces 
  against Protected Persons, is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
  The use of lethal, excessive and intentional force without advance warning, 
  as occurred at Al-Aksa in the case of Majdi Masslamani, violates not only the 
  Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
  but also the IDF Open Fire Regulations. 
<p>Al-Haq calls on the Israeli authorities to immediately disband the so-called 
  Special Undercover Units, and to prosecute to the full extent of the law all 
  military and security personnel who commit willful killing. Al-haq notes that 
  Israel’s non recognition of the de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
  to the Occupied Palestinian Territories is secondary to the fact that such extra-judicial 
  execution is not only prohibited by customary law but by the dictates of public 
  conscience. 
<p>Al-Haq calls upon the Israeli Occupying Forces to: 
<ul>
  <li>Conduct a full, prompt and impartial investigation into the killing and 
    shooting at Al-Aksa mosque, and prosecute all persons responsible; 
  <li>Bring an immediate cessation to the willful killing of all Protected Persons; 
  <li>Act in full conformity with all rules concerning the use of lethal force; 
  <li>Dismantle immediately all undercover units.

<h2>Al Haq</h2>
<B>AL-HAQ CALLS FOR THE URGENT PROVISION OF PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIANS IN THE 
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND WEST BANK FROM ISRAELI SETTLERS' RANDOM VIOLENCE</B> 
<p>Al-Haq is deeply concerned over the seriously deteriorating situation in the 
  Occupied Palestinian Territories and West Bank resulting from Israeli settlers' 
  illegal, violent and unrestricted behavior. Al- Haq's concern is multiplied 
  by the failure of the Israeli Occupational Forces to take any effective measures 
  to put an end to settler practices. 
<p>Settlers are not hesitating to use lethal force; they have opened fire and 
  caused injury by live ammunition to at least four persons resulting in the death 
  of Fahed Mustafa Baker of Biddea village in the Nablus District. Fahed Mustafa 
  Baker, 21, a student at Al-Najah University was shot in the head as a result 
  of settler violence. After being shot, Israeli settlers would not allow an ambulance 
  to enter the area to treat Fahed Baker and four other wounded Palestinians. 
<p>Similar settler attacks occurred last night in al-Jeeb village located in the 
  Ramallah District. Settlers from Givat Zeev, located near al-Jeeb village burned 
  down stores and cars. Some of this activity occurred on Nablus Road leading 
  from Ramallah to Jerusalem. Most of the attacks by settlers throughout the region 
  occurred in the evening and late night. 
<p>In Jerusalem, settlers attacked the neighborhoods of Waldi Al-Jozz and Mussrara 
  and Street #1. These unlawful activities are organized, pre-planned, and directed 
  by the settler movement, which have been outspoken about its intent to continue 
  its escalation of violent and hostile activity, including murder. . Destruction 
  and vandalism by settlers of Palestinian property in all areas of the West Bank 
  and Occupied Territories are taking place in an almost unrestricted fashion. 
  This includes the burning and vandalism of homes, the burning and smashing of 
  cars, and the burning and uprooting of dozens of trees and other personal property. 
<p>Based on the above, al-Haq warns of more serious dangers to come if such practices 
  as described above continue, and if the Israeli authorities continue to fail 
  in taking serious measure to put a stop to these practices. Al-Haq calls the 
  attention of the international community to the increasing lawlessness of the 
  situation endured by Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. Palestinians 
  are living in a constant state of terror, as a result of the failure of the 
  Occupying Power to provide necessary protection in accordance with its legal 
  commitments under international law. 
<p>In light of ongoing settler violence, and the continuing failure of the Occupying 
  Israeli Forces to ensure the safety and security of Palestinians in the Occupied 
  territories, al-Haq calls on the international community, and in particular, 
  on the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, to provide 
  and/or guarantee immediate protection to these Palestinians. Serious and urgent 
  pressure must be brought to hear upon the Israeli authorities to take effective 
  steps to assure the safety of Palestinians. 
<p>Israeli settlers always armed and more than willing to use those arms freely 
  roam the Occupied territories. Israeli army instructions on the use of lethal 
  force by settlers, if they exist, are inadequate, and do not constitute any 
  real attempt to hold back settler excesses. Furthermore, sentences passed on 
  settlers convicted of improper use of firearms are ridiculously light, and do 
  not constitute an effective deterrent to the illegal use of lethal force. Many 
  settlers, convicted and sentenced of murder in the past, have been pardoned 
  and are now living in settlements. 
<p>According to international law, the Israeli Occupying Forces are responsible 
  for the maintenance of security and public order in the areas under their jurisdiction. 
  In practice, however, 'security' for Israelis, including that of illegal settlers, 
  has been a prime concern, while security for Palestinians is nearly non-existent. 
<p>Local and international human rights organizations, the UN, and governments 
  have often appealed to Israel to act in accordance with its obligations under 
  international law, particularly under humanitarian law protecting the lives 
  and well being of the civilians under its occupation, notably, the Fourth Geneva 
  Convention of 1949. Many UN Security Council resolutions have gone unheeded 
  by Israel, and the international community has not taken any effective measures 
  to implement those resolutions. 
<p>Al-Haq believes that measures to prevent further confrontation and bloodshed 
  must take the above factors into consideration. Unless fundamental solutions 
  are found to the endemic problems that inevitably result in human rights violations 
  and tragedies. 
<p>Severe restrictions must be placed on activities and behavior of Israeli settlers 
  in the Occupied Palestinian territories, including removal of weapons. Immediate 
  and effective measures to contain settler violence must be taken. Moreover, 
  measures must be immediately instituted designed to reduce contact and friction 
  between Palestinians and settlers, pending the removal of illegal settlements 
  from the West Bank and Occupied Territories in conformity with international 
  law.

<h3>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section</h3>
<b>Violence Continues as Israeli Settlers and Soldiers Randomly Attack Palestinian 
Civilians</b> 
<p>**PLEASE NOTE: FOR UPDATED STATISTICS REGARDING THE ONGOING ATTACK, WITH PARTICULAR 
  FOCUS ON THE SITUATION OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN, SEE www.dci-pal.org/clashes.htm** 
<p>The ongoing series of attacks against Palestinian civilians escalated yesterday 
  as Israeli soldiers and settlers rampaged throughout the West Bank and Gaza 
  Strip, attacking Palestinian civilians, destroying property, and randomly opening 
  fire. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces demolished 2 residential buildings, 
  leaving more than 240 Palestinian children without homes. As confrontations 
  continue at the northern entrance of Al-Bireh, most residents of the Belu'a 
  and Jebel Al-Taweel neighborhoods have fled after having been warned to do so 
  by the Israeli army. Similar warnings were issued to inhabitants of the Old 
  City of Hebron and in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip. Last night, Israeli settlers, 
  under the protection of the Israeli army attacked Palestinian cities and private 
  property throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, both in residential 
  areas and at crossroads between Palestinian towns. In the Qalqilyeh region, 
  over 8 villages were attacked, including Kufr Haris, Salfit, Deir 'Istiya, Al-Funduq, 
  Jeet, 'Azzoun, Masha, and Huwarra. In the latter of which, Israeli settlers 
  kidnapped 2 Palestinian civilians and burned the homes of Huwarra residents. 
  In nearby Bidiya, 22 year old, Fahed Mustafa Baker died after having been shot 
  in the head by Israeli settlers. Another Palestinian civilian from Al-Funduq 
  village remains in critical condition after being attacked by settlers with 
  a wooden plank studded with nails. 
<p>Since clashes erupted over one week ago, 21 Palestinian children have been 
  killed by Israeli military forces, including 18 year old, 'Alaa Nassar, from 
  'Arrabeh, in the Upper Galilee. According to his brother, 28 year old, Ja'afer 
  Nassar, on 2 October, 'Alaa was returning home with 2 friends after having attended 
  a demonstration in solidarity with Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories. 
  While walking home, a vehicle approached with 3 Israeli soldiers inside. The 
  soldiers called to the boys and when the group turned towards the vehicle, a 
  soldier shot 'Alaa in the chest from less than 10 meters away. An ambulance 
  was called immediately, but was unable to transport 'Alaa to the medical center 
  in time to save him. He was declared dead upon arriving at Al-Hayat Medical 
  Center. 'Alaa's murder came after that of his friend, 17 year old, 'Aseel 'Assalih, 
  martyred on the same day. Statistics available to DCI/PS indicate that over 
  1,000 Palestinian children have been injured as a result of the ongoing and 
  severe Israeli attack. According to DCI/PS fieldwork, no less than 48 children 
  were injured in confrontations on 6 October, and 52 on 7 October. 
<p>The ongoing attack on Palestinian civilians, in particular, the random and 
  violent acts of illegal Israeli settlers, clearly demonstrates the disastrous 
  effects of the international community's failure to insist that Israel abide 
  by international humanitarian and human rights law. Article 49 of the Fourth 
  Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
  War explicitly states that the "Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer 
  parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies." Irrespective 
  of this, since 1967, the Israeli government has facilitated the transfer of 
  approximately 366,000 Israeli civilians into the Occupied Palestinian Territories, 
  including Jerusalem, in clear violation of the Convention, and in defiance of 
  the international community. Article 1, of the aforementioned Convention, requires 
  all States Parties to "undertake respect and to ensure respect for the present 
  Convention in all circumstances." To date, the international community has unilaterally 
  failed to ensure Israel's respect for the convention by allowing it to continue 
  its blatant violations of the Convention. 
<p>As such, DCI/PS calls for the following: 
<ol>
  <li> That the Israeli government immediately end its assault against Palestinian 
    civilians and fulfill its obligations under international law, in particular 
    the Fourth Geneva Convention and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
    which came into effect in Israel on 2 November 1991. 
  <li> That the international community take immediate and effective action, either 
    individually or collectively, to ensure that Israel abides by international 
    humanitarian and human rights law.
