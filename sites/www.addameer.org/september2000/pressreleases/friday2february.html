<p>Weekly Roundup, 25 January - 01 February 2001




<p>
Israeli forces have maintained their violations against civilians in
the Occupied Palestinian Territories, as well as their indiscriminate
use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrations.
<p>
The Israeli army has sent further heavy machinegun and artillery fire
towards residential areas, maintaining the military siege on
Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps. In the past week,
Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinians and caused the death of two
others by preventing them from crossing checkpoints for emergency
medical treatment.

<p>
Violating the right to life and security of person.
<p>
Deaths:
<p>
On Sunday 28 January 2001, 66 year-old Husun Suleiman Daraghmeh from
Al Laban village near Nablus died after Israeli soldiers at the
checkpoint opposite the military liaison outpost in Huwara, south
Nablus, prevented her and her family from crossing to the town's
hospital. According to information gathered by LAW, Daraghmeh was
suffering severe chest pains so her sons attempted to drive her to the
hospital in Nablus. On the way, Israeli soldiers stopped their car for
more than 10 minutes before ordering them to turn back. The driver was
forced to take a very long and rocky route through the villages of
Burin and Tal, but Daraghmeh died in the car. Medical sources at
Rafidia Hospital confirmed that she had died just a few minutes before
arriving.
<p>
At around 11.00 am on Monday 29 January 2001, 21 year-old Muhammad Abu
Mousa from Khan Younis was shot in the chest. According to information
gathered by LAW, he had been walking near a military liaison (DCO)
outpost, 300m from an area where Israeli military bulldozers were
preparing the land for a new military outpost. Israeli soldiers opened
fire at him, puncturing his diaphragm with a bullet that killed him
instantaneously. According to eyewitnesses, no clashes were taking
place at the time.
<p>
At 4.30pm on Tuesday 30 January 2001, 67 year-old Falaah Ayyash from
Rafat near Salfit died of a heart attack fifteen minutes after
arriving at Rafidia Hospital in Nablus. Mufleh Ayyash, Falaah's son,
stated that his father had suffered the attack at 1.15pm, and Mufleh
attempted to take him to Rafidia in a private car. They reached Azoun
junction near Qalqilya at around 1.40pm, where they were kept waiting
for 30 minutes before being turned back. The car was forced to take a
long and unpaved alternative route around the checkpoint. At
approximately 2.40pm, they reached the Deir Sharaf junction in Nablus,
where they were kept waiting by Israeli soldiers at another checkpoint
for 40 minutes before being forced to turn back once again. They took
another long mountainous dirt track and eventually reached the
hospital at around 4.15pm. Due to the long delay, doctors were unable
to save Falaah's life. In normal circumstances, the journey from Rafat
to Nablus takes only 20-25 minutes.
<p>
At around 3pm on Tuesday 31 January 2001, Israeli soldiers at Netsarim
junction in Gaza shot at a Palestinian civilian taxi, mortally
wounding the driver, 50 year-old Ismail Al Tilbani from Al Zawaydeh
camp. According to information gathered by LAW, Ismail was driving his
taxi towards Gaza city. He reached Netsarim as an Israeli military
jeep was in the process of crossing from west to east. The jeep
stopped in the middle of the junction and fired three shots at the
taxi, hitting Al Tilbani in the chest.
<p>
At around 9.30 that night, 38 year-old Saber Abu Thaher, a
construction worker and father of 8 from Hajar Al Deek, died after
receiving at least ten bullets in different parts of his body.
According to information gathered by LAW, he crossed the street
leading to Netsarim junction on his way home. At that time, Israeli
soldiers were shooting heavily at the houses of Hajar Al Deek. Abu
Thaher was shot ten times and died instantaneously. His body was taken
to Al Shifa' Hospital through the DCO (military liaison).

<p>Assault on medical personnel

<p>On Thursday January 25, 2001, at the entrance of Surda in the Ramallah
district, Israeli soldiers restrained and brutally assaulted two
Palestinian medical workers: a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance
driver (Talal Ida, 40), and his colleague (Naji Al Barghouthi, 30).

<p>In a sworn affidavit, Talal Ida told to LAW the following: "At around
2pm on Thursday, January 25, 2001, I went to Qalandia collect an
injured person. He turned out to be Israeli, so he was sent to the
Israeli authorities. Then I returned to the Red Crescent center in Al
Bireh and then to Ein Yabroud to take another injured person to Al
Mustaqbal Hospital. I wanted to return to the center, but at 9.35pm I
received a telephone call telling me there was another patient in
Surda. Naji and went there, and we saw an Israeli military jeep parked
about 100m away from the patient's house. I stopped the ambulance and
four soldiers ordered us to switch off the engine, get out and put our
hands up. They searched us and ordered us to lie on the ground. It was
so cold and wet, because it had been raining hard that evening. We lay
down on the wet ground. Whenever we tried to move, soldiers pointed
their guns at our heads and ordered us to stay where we were. This
continued for almost an hour, until they began to beat us. I was hit
hard on the head, and then I realised I was being dragged along the
ground. They ordered Naji to help me, because I was in a bad
condition. Eventually I lost consciousness, and I woke up in the
Ramallah Hospital at 11.30am on Friday January 26."

<p>Once contact was lost, an ambulance officer, Muhammad Al Huwari, and
the driver, Muhammad Salem, were sent to the scene. According to
information from the Red Crescent, once the second ambulance arrived,
soldiers shouted at the driver to stop. As soon as Al Huwari saw the
first ambulance, and Naji and Abu Ida, he telephoned the center to
report that his colleagues had been captured. This was the last
message the center received, because the soldiers confiscated all
equipment before dragging the two new arrivals out of the ambulance
and ordering them to take off their Red Crescent jackets.

<p>The soldiers took their IDs and ordered them to strip to the waist.
The ambulance staff were forced, in the very cold weather, to sit on
the ground for more than 20 minutes. Abu Ida, by that point, was very
badly injured. He was on the edge of hypothermia, suffering severe
chest pains and his arms and legs were in spasms, so the soldiers told
Salem and Huwari to help him. Then an Israeli officer told Naji to
tell Abu Ida that he was to see the Israeli interrogation officer
Lu'ay in the Ofer military center near Bitunia at 9.00 on Monday,
January 29.

<p>At 12.45, Salem and Al Hawari carried Abu Ida to Ramallah Hospital. He
remains in intensive care.

<p>Salem returned with another ambulance driver to retrieve the ambulance
where Naji was being detained inside. The soldiers had left the scene,
after ordering Naji not to move for at least 30 minutes.


<p>Assault of press personnel

<p>At around 1pm on Sunday January 28, 2001, staff from Ramallah's Watan
TV station, including female journalist Duha Al Shami (22) and
cameraman Ashraf Katkat, were captured and assaulted by Israeli
soldiers at a military checkpoint west of Ramallah. According to
information gathered by LAW, while they were on their way to Ein
Qinyia to cover a story, Israeli soldiers prevented them from passing
through the checkpoint although they showed their press passes and
personal IDs. Soldiers assaulted Duha and confiscated the camera,
videocassettes and her ID. They also gave Al Katkat an order to see
the Israeli interrogation department in Hebron. Their detention
continued for some time before they were released upon the
intervention of the Palestinian DCO. All their belongings were
returned the following day (January 29).


<p>Closure and Siege (Residential Areas)

<p>At 6pm on Wednesday January 31, 2001, Israeli military forces imposed
another curfew on the H2 area of Hebron, just a few minutes after a
group of armed settlers from Abraham Avino committed a series of
terror assaults under the protection of the Israeli army. They opened
fire at houses in Al Qazazin and Al Sahleh quarters, attacked
citizens, stores and vegetable markets, destroyed vegetables and
fruits and broke windows.

<p>It is worth mentioning that the area has been continuously subjected
to such measures during the last four months.

<p>Israeli forces also re-imposed a curfew on Silwad, near Ramallah, on
the morning of Wednesday January 31 2001, after it had been lifted
only three days before. Soldiers also blocked all the roads leading to
and from the village.

<p>From Monday January 29 to Tuesday January 30 2001, Israeli forces
blocked a
great number of the roads between and entrances to Palestinian
villages and towns. For example, they placed cement blocks across
Arabeh junction in Jenin, as well as the northern entrance to Al Ram
(north of Jerusalem) and all entrances to Jib'a village. They also
blocked the southern entrance of Bethlehem and Qalqilya, restricted
military blocks and jeeps at the entrances of roads between different
Palestinian districts of the West Bank, and subjected citizens to
arbitrary inspections.


<p>LAW Remarks

<p>1. The Israeli occupation forces are committing increasing crimes
against Palestinian civilians. 2. They are using the Israeli war
arsenal against unarmed Palestinian civilians. 3. They continue to
bomb and shell residential Palestinian areas. 4. They continue to use
collective punishment methods against Palestinians and deprive then of
their basic human rights.


<p>In light of the above, LAW demands the following:

<p>1. The Israeli Government to immediately stop the use of excessive and
indiscriminate force and collective punishments against Palestinian
civilians. <p>2. The establishment of an international investigation
committee based on United Nations Security Council resolutions 1322 of
Oct 7, 2000, to investigate the violations of international
humanitarian law committed by the Israeli forces inside the occupied
Palestinian territories.<p> 3. The international community must hold a
conference for the High Contracting Parties of the Fourth Geneva
Convention in order to take practical measures to ensure Israel's
adherence to the convention. <p>4. The international community must
pressurize Israel to immediately to immediately put an end to the
occupation of the Palestinian territories and effectively support the
implementation of the Palestinian right to self-determination.

<h3> <a name="watc">Women's Affairs Technical Committee (WATC) </a></h3>
<b>Israeli Occupation Forces Torture Palestinian Women Prisoners
and Place Them Under Solitary Confinement</b>



<p>
The oppressive and terrorizing practices that the Israeli Occupation
Forces (IOF) are perpetrating against Palestinian prisoners are
escalating.  Since the beginning of the current Palestinian uprising
(Intifada), the IOF has placed five Palestinian women political
prisoners under solitary confinement, humiliating "security" 
measures
and degrading imprisonment conditions.  Furthermore, the women's
families are forbidden from visiting them, which adds to their
torture, sense of isolation and deteriorating psychological
situations.
<p>
We, in the Women's Affairs Technical Committee in Palestine, 
assert
our solidarity with these women political prisoners.  We appeal to the
international community, all human rights institutions and defenders
of justice around the world to intervene for the immediate release of
the five Palestinian women political prisoners. Moreover, we call upon
our Palestinian people and the Arab masses worldwide to join us in our
demand for the immediate release by the IOF of the five Palestinian
women Political prisoners.  We will not rest until these women's
voices are heard around the world, and until justice prevails.

The five Palestinian women political prisoners are:
<p>      Suna Mahmoud Ar-Ra'I from Qalqilya who was arrested at her
return from Jordan on Aril 12, 1997 <p>      Suad Hilmi Ghazal, 17 years
old from Sabastia in the suburbs of Nablus who was arrested on
December 13, 1998 and sentenced six years <p>     Nisreen Ya'coub Taha
from the village in Bidya, Salfeet, who was arrested on March 25, 1998
<p>    Maha Ibrahim Al'ikk from Bethlehem arrested on August 2, 2000 <p>
     Amneh  Jawad Muna from Bir-nabala in the suburbs of Jerusalem
arrested on January 24,2001
