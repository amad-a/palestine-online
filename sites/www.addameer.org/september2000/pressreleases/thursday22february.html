<b>IS ANYONE LISTENING?
Israeli Occupation Forces Attack School for Blind
Palestinian Children</b>

<p>
In the latest installment of the over four month Israeli
siege against
Palestinian civilians, Israeli occupation forces attacked
the Al-Wataniya
School for Blind Girl Children on Tuesday evening, 20
February 2001.  The
school, which provides education and housing to 75 blind
girls, ranging
between 5 and 18 years old and 15 teachers, is located
opposite the
illegall Israeli settlement of Psagot in Al-Bireh.  In
addition to causing
serious damage to the two-story building and its
surrounding wall,
Tuesday's attack succeeded in terrorizing tens of blind
children and the
school personnel.  
<p>
When the hour long attack began at approximately 9:45pm,
school officials
moved students from their second floor bedrooms on the
eastern side of the
building, opposite the settlement, to a safer place on the
western side.
Israeli ammunition, fired from Psagot settlement,
penetrated the windows of
the bedrooms where the children had been staying and
damaged beds and other
furniture.  In addition, an artillery shell was fired into
and destroyed
one of the rooms on the western side of the building, where
the students
were taking shelter.  All the windows of the building,
along with the water
pipes and, consequently, the heating system, were destroyed
as a result of
the attack.  Other Palestinian property in the area also
sustained damage
during the attack, particularly in the Al-Jinan, Jebel
Al-Taweel, and
Al-Sharafe neighborhoods adjacent to the settlement.  At
least one
apartment in the area was set ablaze and completely
destroyed as a result
of the heavy gunfire.  
<p>
Tuesday's attack is yet another manifestation of an
intensified, gross, and
systematic policy of child rights violations by the Israeli
occupation
authority.  Since the outbreak of the Intifada on 28
September 2000,
Israeli military forces and illegal Israeli settlers have
violated
virtually every right and principle enshrined in the 1989
UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which Israel willingly signed and
ratified.  Among
the most prominent of these are violations of the rights to
life, to an
adequate standard of living, to education, and to adequate
healthcare.  As
of 21 February 2000, 100 Palestinian children have been
killed, around
4,000 injured, and thousands of others traumatized by
Israeli attacks on
homes, businesses, and schools.  As Tuesday's attack
highlights, Israeli
practice does not distinguish between adult and child, home
and school,
armed and unarmed, civilian and military.   
<p>
Since the beginning of the Intifada, DCI/PS has
consistently re-iterated
the need for international intervention to protect the
safety and
well-being of Palestinian civilian residents of the
occupied territories.
DCI/PS has highlighted the fact that the current situation
is an
intensification of the pattern of gross human rights
violations that has
characterized the over 30 year Israeli occupation of the
West Bank,
including Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip.  Moreover, DCI/PS has
stressed that
the current situation is the result of Israel's continual
failure to comply
with international human rights and humanitarian law, and
the international
community's failure to insist that it do so.  In spite of
numerous pleas
and those of other organizations and institutions operating
in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian children continue to be
killed, maimed,
arrested, imprisoned, and terrorized on a daily basis by
Israeli military
forces and illegal Israeli settlers present in the occupied
territories.
Palestinian civilian residents under military occupation
have absolutely no
means of protecting themselves, their property, or their
children.  In
light of this, DCI/PS strongly urges each and every person
or institution
that receives this alert to take immediate action.

<b>LAW Weekly Roundup<br>
15-21 February 2001</b>

<br><br>
During the third week of February, Israeli forces continued
to shoot at,
beat and abuse unarmed Palestinian civilians, shell
Palestinian residential
areas, hold Palestinian towns and villages under siege and
pursue their
policy of extra-judicial execution.
<br><br>
In the past week, Israeli soldiers and police reportedly
caused the death of
eight Palestinians; four through shelling Palestinian
towns, one by
assassination, two during a car chase by the Israeli
police, and one who was
prevented from crossing an Israeli checkpoint.
<br><br>
First: Violating the right to life and security of person
<br><br>
1. Deaths
<br><br>
* 29 year-old Isam Al Taweel, a father of 3 from Hebron,
died on February 16
after being shot in the chest. According to eyewitness
statements to LAW,
Isam was on the way to his home in Al Karantina opposite
the Jewish Avraham
Avino enclave in Hebron when he got caught in the Israeli
shelling of Al
Karantina. He bled for some time before anyone could reach
him. According to
LAW’s information, five other Palestinians were wounded in
the attack;
Malaka Al Bakeri (42) was hit by shrapnel in the back, and
Nawal and Yacoub
Marar were hit by shrapnel in their home.
<br><br>
* Shakir Al Manasra, 23, from Bani Na’eem, Hebron, also
died on Friday 16
February, when Israeli forces bombed the cow farm where he
worked.
Eyewitness Jalal Faraj, 26, told LAW that he and three of
his colleagues
were sitting in a room in the farm at 8:30pm when Israeli
forces started
bombing. Ahmad Faraj Allah, 33, who was shot in the stomach
during the
attack, died on Sunday 18 February. Ahmad had a brother
named Faraj who was
killed in the first Intifada, and Ahmad had married his
dead brother’s wife.
Also injured in the attack was Manasra’s brother Yusif
Mawas, 30, who was
shot in the right shoulder and left arm.
<br><br>
* Usama Al Kurbi, 18, from Beit Sahour, was killed on
Thursday 20 February
when the rood of his house caved in on him due to shelling
by the Israeli
army. According to LAW’s documentation, many parts of Beit
Sahour such as Al
Iraq quarter, the environs of the Saint Nicholas cathedral
and the Orthodox
Centre were shelled by Israeli artillery and automatic
gunfire from Gilo
settlement. Usama was buried under the wreckage for several
hours before his
family and fire-fighters could pull him out.
<br><br>
* 76 year-old Abdul Rahman Jum’a from Beit Leid in Tulkarem
died when
Israeli soldiers delayed the car taking him to hospital for
one hour.
Eyewitness Muhanad Jum’a told LAW:
<br><br>
“At 10am on Friday, we took Jum’a in a car to hospital in
Tulkarem after he
felt a severe chest pain. When we arrived at the checkpoint
at the entrance
of Tulkarem, we told the Israeli soldiers there that we had
with us a very
ill man who needed to be hospitalised. They refused to let
us pass, but held
us at the checkpoint for an hour. Finally, when we arrived
at the hospital
an hour and a half later, the doctor told us that Jum’a had
passed away half
an hour ago. The road to the hospital normally takes half
an hour.”
<br><br>
* Mohammad Al Hawamda, 25, from Al Samou’a, Hebron, and
Omar Abu Tarash, 20,
from Al Kiya in Bir Al Sabia’a, died when Israeli police
chased Al Hawamda’s
car, which hit that of Abu Tarash. Ismail Al Hawamda, 25,
was injured in the
incident. Al Hawamda’a was on his way home after a working
day in Bir Al
Sabia’a (within the borders of Israel).
<br><br>
* Mahmoud Al Madani, 25, from Balata refugee camp, was
reportedly
assassinated in an ambush by Israeli Special Forces on
February 19. He was
shot and killed as he left the camp’s mosque accompanied by
his 21 year-old
brother at 2:30 pm. LAW Society’s documentation indicates
that Mahmoud and
his brother Nur Al Deen left Fatouh Mosque in Balata. As
they passed the
south-eastern entrance to the camp near Jerusalem Road on
their way to their
grocery store, Mahmoud was shot twice in the chest, once in
the waist, and
once in the left shoulder. He was taken to Rafidia hospital
in Nablus, where
he was pronounced dead at 6:30 pm. Mahmoud’s brother, Nur
Al Deen, stated to
LAW that the shots had been fired from very close range.
According to the
initial medical report, the distance was estimated at 15
metres. Nur Al Deen
added that the bullets had exploded inside his brother.
<br><br>
According to LAW’s investigation, immediately after Mahmoud
had been shot
soldiers at the nearby Israeli military outpost on Mount
Jirzeem  opened
fire, seemingly to cover up the work of the Special Forces
and aid their
retreat from the area. Later that evening, the official
Israeli media
declared, “A Special Forces unit south of Nablus today
opened fire at a
Palestinian man, wanted by the security services for being
involved in acts
of aggression such as explosions inside Israel, and
critically wounded him.”
<br><br>
2. Injuries
<br><br>
84 Palestinians were injured when Israeli forces attacked
Palestinian
protesters in Hebron, Al Bireh and Deir Nitham and in the

several chicken
farms. They invaded the home of Nasser Al Sha’er, held his
family hostage

also severely
damaged, and he is currently in intensive care. Yusif Abu
Rabee’a, 21, from
Al Fawar refugee camp, was severely beaten by Israeli
soldiers. 11 year-old
Munthir Abu Warda from the same refugee camp was hit in the

the cemetery wall
opposite the Avraham Avino Jewish enclave in Hebron with
another three girls
from my school - Al Yacobiya Basic School. We were on our
way to school and
there were soldiers on the street. Suddenly I felt
something hit me in my
right arm and left leg. I was taken to a nearby UNRWA

<p>
On the same day, Israeli forces shelled Maryland Theme Park

Martin Vwrgn from
South Africa. Vwrgn told LAW,
<p>
“Yesterday, 19 February, the workers of Maryland had a
break between 7 and
8pm. During that time, we heard gunshots coming from the
left of Maryland.
The shooting went on for at least an hour. Two or three
bullets came towards
us, so we started to run for safety. I realised that myself
and a friend had
been wounded. There was no shots at that moment; we just
felt a burning
feeling. My friend fell to the ground and I saw blood
coming from his leg;
then I realised that I was also bleeding. Some people found
more
gold-coloured bullets. Both of us had been hit by bullets
from the left. We
were taken straight to hospital for treatment. Everything
happened so fast
that we had no idea who was shooting at us. If the bullets
had been shot a
little higher the wounds would probably be much worse. We
are both ok now
but we will remember this for the rest of our lives.”

<p>The homes of the following peoples were hit during the
shelling of Beit
<p>Jala:

village, damaging the
homes of Sa’id and Mohammad Salah.
<p>
On Tuesday February 20, Israeli forces shelled Beit Sahour
and Bethlehem
from Gilo settlement, killing Ibrahim Usama Al Kurbi.

<p>
Third: Siege and curfew
<p>
The curfew of the occupied part of Hebron continues, with
40,000
Palestinians being held under curfew for two consecutive
weeks, including
12,000 students unable to go to school.

<p>The Israeli policy of siege and collective punishment has
deprived
Palestinians from travelling from one place to another and
Muslim pilgrims
from travelling to Mecca.

<p>LAW Society reiterates the following:

<p>1. Israeli forces are committing increased crimes and using
the Israeli war
arsenal against unarmed Palestinian civilians.
<p>2. They continue to shell Palestinian residential areas.
<p>3. They continue to use collective punishment against
Palestinians and
deprive them of their basic human rights.
<p>4. Israeli forces use settlements as bases from which to
bomb Palestinian
areas

<p>LAW demands:

<p>1. The Israeli government to immediately stop its crimes
and collective
punishment against Palestinians.
<p>2. An international investigation committee to be set up,
working according
to UN Resolution 1322.
<p>3. The Contracting Parties to the 4th Geneva Convention to
ensure Israel’s
compliance with the Convention.
<p>4. Palestinians to be placed under international
protection.
<p>5. The international community to put an end to these
crimes and the Israeli
occupation.
