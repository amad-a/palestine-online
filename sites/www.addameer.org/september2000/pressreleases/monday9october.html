<h2>World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)</h2>
<b> The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in 
the following situation in Jordan.</b> 
<p>Brief description of the situation 
<p>The International Secretariat of OMCT is gravely concerned by information received 
  from a reliable source concerning the use of excessive force on demonstrators, 
  expressing their support for the Palestinian people, in Jordan. These actions 
  follow a recent statement by the Jordanian Prime Minister to ban all demonstrations 
  held in support of the Palestinian people. 
<p>According to information collected by the reliable source, Usama Abdul-Karim 
  Ali Qasem, 18 years old was reported to have been killed on Friday 6th October 
  by a bullet in the chest from the anti riot police, while more than 20 persons 
  were reported injured, many with serious injuries. 
<p>Anti riot police heavily used tear gas bombs and rods against demonstrators 
  causing internal bleeding and broken bones among many injured persons who are 
  still in hospitals receiving necessary treatment. The Arab Center for Heart 
  Surgery Hospital reported that 4 among the five persons admitted in the emergency 
  department were women. One woman interviewed reported that 5 riot policemen 
  had beaten her on the head and face causing her internal bleeding and broken 
  cheekbones. The woman added that the police have used insulting language and 
  have irritated peoples' emotions by tearing up the Palestinian flags the demonstrators 
  were carrying. 
<p>In addition, riot police have detained many demonstrators throughout the city 
  Amman who have not been released until now. 
<p>In a statement issued by the Prime Minister of Jordan, Ali Abu Al-Ragheb, it 
  was stated that all demonstrations and marches in Jordan in support of the Palestinian 
  people were banned. Furthermore, in the statement the government threatened 
  to take harsh measures against any violation of the decisions and orders taken 
  by security departments and related authorities. The government claimed that 
  the ban was imposed due to violent actions undertaken by demonstrators. The 
  government spread tanks and riot police near all the mosques in the capital 
  city Amman as a preventive measure against any attempt by citizens to peaceful 
  expression of solidarity. 
<p>On the 7th of October, the government had also banned a children's march to 
  UNICEF in solidarity with Mohammad Al- Durah, (a child shot dead by Israeli 
  forces in recent demonstrations in Palestine) organized by the Children's Committee 
  of the Jordanian Women's Union and children were not allowed to reach the UNICEF 
  premises in Amman. Again insulting language was used against children and participating 
  women. 
<p>Action requested 
<p>Please write to the authorities in Jordan urging them to: 
<ol>
  <li>Put an immediate end to the use of excessive force against Jordanian demonstrators 
    and ensure that all law enforcement agencies conform to international human 
    rights standards and a thorough and impartial investigation into all deaths 
    and injuries in order to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and 
    apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions as provided by law; 
  <li>order the immediate release of those persons reportedly detained, in the 
    absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before 
    an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights 
    at all times; 
  <li>.guarantee compensation to the family of Usama Abdul Karim Ali and to all 
    injured people; 
  <li>guarantee the respect of human rights and the fundamental freedoms throughout 
    the country in accordance with national laws and international human rights 
    standards.

<p><b>Urgent Appeal to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for the protection of the 
  Palestinian national minority in Israel</b></p>
<p>2:00 A.M., Monday 9 October 2000 </p>
<P>Mr. Kofi A. Annan,<BR>
  Secretary General<BR>
  United Nations<BR>
  <BR>
  Honorable Mr. Kofi Annan, I write to you with an urgent appeal, as an elected 
  representative of the Palestinian national minority in Israel, to meet with 
  the leadership of the Palestinian national minority and call for immediate United 
  Nations intervention on our behalf and the protection of our rights as stipulated 
  in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
  Religious and Linguistic Minorities (1992).<BR>
  <BR>
  For the past eleven days, since the commencement of what has come to be known 
  as the 'Al-Aqsa Intifada,' we have been living in a grave state of danger.<BR>
  <BR>
  The official excuse for the current violent repression of the Palestinian national 
  minority in Israel is our public protest brought on by the visit of MK Ariel 
  Sharon to Haram al-Sharif in the old city of Jerusalem, and its bloody aftermath.<BR>
  <BR>
  Every national minority must have the fundamental right to civil protest.<BR>
  <BR>
  . September 29 - October 6, 2000: during civil protests on the part of Arab 
  citizens inside Israel in response to ongoing Israeli brutality against Palestinians, 
  the Israeli police killed 12 Arab citizens with live ammunition and rubber coated 
  metal bullets, and injured dozens.<BR>
  <BR>
  . October 7, 2000: in response to news of the kidnapping of 3 Israeli soldiers 
  by Hizballah, Israeli Jewish civilians began rioting, attacking Arab citizens, 
  most of them laborers at their places of work. Dozens of injured Arab citizens, 
  some critically, have bee hospitalized. Arab-owned businesses have been burned. 
  In Tiberias, rioters desecrated an ancient mosque. Despite the fact that rioting 
  by Jews included the use of knives and molotov cocktails, the police demonstrated 
  a negligent inability to defend Arab citizens and their property.<BR>
  <BR>
  . October 8, 2000: some 300 Jewish rioters attacked the home of MK Azmi Bishara 
  in Nazareth Ilit. <BR>
  The rioters, who stoned the house, were equipped with torches and declared their 
  intention to burn the house down.<BR>
  <BR>
  . A few hours ago: Jewish rioters from Nazareth Ilit began attacking the eastern 
  neighborhood of Nazareth, with live ammunition. The police, who have directed 
  their force at the Arab residents under attack instead of at their Jewish attackers, 
  have killed at least one civilian thus far, and injured countless others. Since 
  the Israeli authorities are unable to offer us protection, but rather are the 
  perpetrators of the violence directed against us, I see no choice but to ask 
  you to meet with us and call upon the international community to intervene on 
  our behalf.<BR>
  <BR>
  Sincerely,<BR>
  MK Azmi Bishara<BR>
  National Democratic Assembly</P>

</font></b> 
<p align=3DCENTER><font size=3D6 face=3D"Times New Roman"><b>Even in "Time of 
  War" - Not All Is Permitted</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">There have been reports of several violent incidents 
  during this past week in the Occupied Territories. In some cases both sides 
  acted as against international humanitarian law. The provisions of this law 
  place constraints on permissible acts during wartime, in order to minimize injury 
  to those who take no active part in the hostilities: prisoners of war, wounded 
  persons and civilians. Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Ehud Barak, said 
  on Saturday: "Up to now I have ordered restraint. Not to act, only to react. 
  But if we don't see a change within the next two days...we will instruct the 
  IDF and the security forces to take any means at their disposal to stop the 
  violence."</font></p>
<p><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">In view of this, B'Tselem would like to inform 
  all parties of the rules which bind them, according to = international law, 
  in these cases:</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Protection of&nbsp; civilians</font></b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: 
  Shooting at civilians is permissible only in cases of real and immediate danger 
  to llife. Shooting is permitted only against those who pose a threat to life, 
  and such shooting must be proportional to the threat and intended to put it 
  at a distance. Even in the case of real and immediate danger to life indiscriminate 
  shooting at civilians is prohibited.</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Distinction between armed and unarmed persons</font></b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: 
  Persons armed with firearms are forbidden to congregate with unarmed persons, 
  even if these be stone throwers. Interfusion of these two groups puts unarmed 
  persons at risk. Nevertheless, the fact that one side to the conflict does not 
  hearken to these prohibitions does not permit the other side to ignore the above 
  rules concerning injury to civilians.<u> </u>In view of this: Shooting by the 
  Israeli security forces at a crowd, from which they are being shot at and their 
  lives put at risk, must be directed, as far as is possible, to the source of 
  danger. Injury to unarmed civilians nearby must be curtailed even if they be 
  throwing stones. Such shooting must be proportional to the danger and it is 
  impermissible, for example, to react to gun-shooting with anti-tank missiles. 
  Furthermore, rubber-covered metal bullets are lethal. Therefore, they must be 
  used only in life-threatening situations and not for crowd dispersal. The Palestinian 
  Authority must ensure that people armed with firearms be placed separately from 
  civilians, even if these be stone throwers. This rule applies until such time 
  as this population must be defended against exaggerated use of force by Israeli 
  security forces which threatens civilians' lives. Shooting directed at settlements 
  by Palestinians, when there is no danger to life, is prohibited.</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Protection of wounded persons, medical personnel, 
  and ambulances</font></b><font size=3D2 =
FACE=3D"Arial">: It is absolutely prohibited to intentionally attack medical personnel 
  and ambulances, and they are to be permitted free movement for evacuation of 
  the wounded. In any case of casualties, shooting must be stopped at the earliest 
  possible circumstances to enable their evacuation.</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Violence perpetrated by Israeli civilians</font></b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: 
  Israeli security forces are obliged to protect Palestinians from violence perpetrated 
  by Israeli civilians.</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Freedom of movement</font></b><font 
=
SIZE=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: Passage of food and medical supplies to the territories 
  must be ensured, as well as freedom of movement, including into Israel, in cases 
  of humanitarian emergencies. Curfew will be administered only in extreme circumstances 
  and as a last resort. In no case will curfew be administered as a punitive measure. 
  In cases where curfew is administered, the population must be permitted to exit 
  their homes for provisions of food and medical supplies.</font><u> </u><font =
SIZE=3D2 face=3D"Arial">In view of this: the curfew administered since Oct. 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  on H2 areas in Hebron must be called off, Dahania Airport in Gaza must be reopened, 
  and Palestinians must be permitted to travel abroad. </font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Journalists</font></b><font =
SIZE=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: As far as is possible, under the circumstances, journalists 
  must be given freedom of operation to report. In no case may journalists, or 
  their equipment, be intentionally attacked.</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Damage to Holy Places</font></b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: 
  Both sides must protect the holy sites and refrain from their defilement. </font> 
  <br>
  <b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Collective punishment</font></b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">: 
  Collective punishment of civilian population - such as harm to water or electricity, 
  bombing of civilian infrastructure, or limitation of freedom of movement - is 
  absolutely prohibited.</font></p>
<p><b><font size=3D2 face=3D"Arial">Prisoners</font></b><font size=3D2

<b>Israel/Occupied Territories/Lebanon: Amnesty International calls for UN investigation</b> 
<p>* News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty International 
  * 
<p>"Since 29 September, Israeli security forces have frequently used excessive 
  force on demonstrators when lives were not in immediate danger," Amnesty International 
  said today. 
<p> In preliminary conclusions from Amnesty International's delegation in Israel 
  and the Occupied Territories the human rights organization reiterated its condemnation 
  of the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials. 
<p> "In many cases the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the Israel Police and the 
  Border Police have apparently breached their own internal regulations on the 
  use of force, as well as international human rights standards on the use of 
  force and firearms," Amnesty International said. 
<p>More than 80 people, including children, nearly all of them Palestinians from 
  the Occupied Territories and Israel, have died since clashes began on 29 September 
  2000 between Israeli security forces and Palestinian demonstrators all over 
  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as in Israel. There have also been 
  armed confrontations between the Israeli and Palestinian security forces. 
<p>An Amnesty International delegation is currently in Israel and the Occupied 
  Territories, including the areas under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, 
  to examine policing of demonstrations in view of the loss of life. The delegation 
  is composed of Dr. Stephen Males, a former senior Police officer of the UK police 
  with special expertise in sensitive public order policing, and Dr Elizabeth 
  Hodgkin, a researcher from the International Secretariat of Amnesty International. 
<p> The delegates have met NGOs, doctors and over 50 witnesses to the events. 
  They have visited to sites in Ramallah, Nablus, East Jerusalem, Nazareth, Arabah 
  and other parts of northern Israel, places where demonstrators have died after 
  the Israeli security forces fired on demonstrators and rioters. The delegates 
  have seen large quantities of expended and some live ammunition, rubber-coated 
  metal bullets, CS grenades and projectiles, during visits to sites of demonstrations, 
  as well as bullets embedded in surrounding homes and much bullet damage. 
<p>Amnesty International has compiled the following preliminary conclusions: 
<ul>
  <li>In many cases security forces apparently used firearms when their lives 
    and the lives of others were not in imminent danger. However, according to 
    internationally adopted principles, law enforcement officials shall only use 
    firearms, if other means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving 
    the intended result. Firearms may be used against people, after appropriate 
    warnings are given, only to prevent death or serious injury where less extreme 
    means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. The standards underscore 
    that law enforcement officials may resort to the intentional lethal use of 
    firearms only when strictly unavoidable to protect life.<br>
    <br>
  <li>In some instances, Israeli security forces impeded wounded persons from 
    receiving access to medical assistance. Security forces also reportedly fired 
    on people helping to remove the wounded, in two cases killing ambulance men. 
    The International Committee of the Red Cross has publicly appealed to all 
    parties to protect and assist the injured and all medical personnel in their 
    vital life-saving operations.<br>
    <br>
  <li>In instances where the security forces have not been deployed against demonstrators, 
    riots have generally not evolved and crowds have dispersed. For example, after 
    two days in which two Palestinians were killed in demonstrations in Um al-Fahm 
    in Israel on 1 and 2 October, on 3 October security forces did not arrive 
    to police a demonstration and demonstrators dispersed peacefully. 
</ul>
<p>Two Palestinian refugees were also reported killed in south Lebanon on 7 October 
  when Israeli troops opened fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border on demonstrators 
  protesting against Israel. 
<p> On 7 October, three Israeli soldiers were captured at about noon by the Lebanese 
  armed group Hizbullah. Amnesty International calls on Hizbullah to accord the 
  three soldiers prisoner of war status and to allow them immediate access to 
  the International Committee of the Red Cross. Amnesty International notes that 
  Hizbullah has publicly stated its intention to use the three Israeli soldiers 
  to secure the release of Lebanese and other Arab prisoners held in Israel. 
<p> Amnesty International reminds Hizbullah that hostage-taking is prohibited 
  by international law and is inconsistent with fundamental principles of international 
  humanitarian law. Amnesty International has long called for the release of Lebanese 
  detainees held in Israel as hostages, including Shaykh 'Abd al-Karim al-'Ubayd 
  and Mustafa al-Dirani. 
<p>A national commission established by the Israeli government will investigate 
  killings which occurred in Israel. However, it is important that all killings 
  are investigated which occurred in circumstances suggesting that they violated 
  international law and standards. Investigations should be conducted by an independent 
  and impartial body and by one which, in the current highly-charged political 
  atmosphere, is perceived as such. 
<p>Amnesty International is therefore calling on the United Nations to establish 
  urgently an independent international investigation, to include criminal justice 
  experts known for their impartiality and integrity, to investigate all killings 
  of civilians that took place since 29 September in Israel, the Occupied Territories 
  and south Lebanon. 
<p> "To ensure independence and impartiality of the international investigation, 
  its members should exclude persons whose background could appear to lack impartiality," 
  Amnesty International said. 
<p> "The investigation should be properly resourced and include ballistic, forensic 
  or other technical experts that may be required. It should report to the Commission 
  on Human Rights, the General Assembly and the Security Council, and the authorities 
  concerned should be obliged to cooperate fully with the investigation."

<h3>Defence of Children International - Palestine Section</h3>
<b>VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS CONTINUE: DCI/PS LAUNCHES CRISIS 
INTERVENTION PROJECT </b> 
<p>Israeli military violence against Palestinian civilians continues throughout 
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip and inside Israel proper. The last few days have 
  seen a dramatic escalation to the conflict, with Israeli settlers and soldiers 
  attacking Palestinian civilians and private property and confrontations between 
  Arab protestors and Israeli military forces at Bab Al-Fatima, the last Israeli 
  checkpoint on the Lebanese side before the Israeli border. On 7 October, Hizbullah 
  activists captured three Israeli soldiers who were serving in Occupied Arab 
  Territory near Shab'a farms. Yesterday evening, Israeli Jewish fundamentalists 
  attacked Palestinian civilians and property in Nazareth, killing 42 year old 
  Mohammed Omar Akawi. For the second evening straight, Israeli settlers, under 
  the protection of Israeli soldiers, rampaged throughout the Occupied Palestinian 
  Territories, destroying property and attacking Palestinian civilians and their 
  homes. In Um Safah, north of Ramallah, Israeli settlers attacked 40 year old, 
  'Assam Joudeh and set his body on fire. 
<p>DCI/PS views with grave concern the recent series of settler attacks, which 
  were preceded by demonstrations of Israeli settlers and right-wing fundamentalists 
  shouting slogans of 'death to the arabs'. Beginning with the killing of 18 month 
  old Sarah 'Abdel 'Atheem 'Abdel Haq by an Israeli settler on 1 October 2000 
  and continuing to the present, it is clear that Israeli settlers are actively 
  engaged in a war against Palestinian civilians, thus, turning the rhetoric of 
  slogans into tragic reality. To date, four Palestinians have been killed as 
  a result of settler violence and tens injured. Moreover, Israeli settlers destroy 
  Palestinian property, attack homes, and randomly open fire against Palestinian 
  civilians. These actions occur with the full knowledge of the Israeli army, 
  who rather than arresting the settlers, provide protection for them, and instead, 
  arrest Palestinian victims. 
<p>In the confrontations that have erupted following Israeli opposition leader 
  Ariel Sharon's provocative 28 September visit to the Al-Aqsa compound, over 
  20 Palestinian children have been killed, with an additional four declared clinically 
  dead after sustaining serious injuries in the clashes. Statistics reported thus 
  far indicate that over 2,000 Palestinians have been wounded, at least 18 of 
  whom sustained injuries to the eyes. Moreover, hundreds of Palestinian children 
  have been forced to flee from their homes in order to escape the random violence 
  of Israeli settlers and soldiers. In the midst of these ongoing attacks, an 
  atmosphere of fear permeates Palestinian residential areas. 
<p>DCI/PS joins the growing number of local organizations, institutions and individuals 
  that are calling for international protection for Palestinian civilians against 
  the violent assault of Israeli soldiers and settlers. Of particular concern 
  to DCI/PS are the long-term psycho-social ramifications the recent attacks will 
  have on Palestinian children. While the immediate violence may end, the negative 
  impact of the recent events will have lasting effects on Palestinian children. 
  Such afflictions affect the child's life in every sphere, often causing great 
  difficulty in their ability to concentrate at school, to relate to their peers, 
  to find employment, and to develop normally. 
<p>As such, DCI/PS has launched a crisis intervention project in all areas of 
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The project, which is being carried out in coordination 
  with the Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs, will be implemented within 
  the framework of DCI/PS's Social Program and seeks to reduce the adverse psycho-social 
  affects on Palestinian children of the ongoing violent clashes between Palestinian 
  civilians and Israeli military forces. Around 175 trained psychologists and 
  social workers will implement outreach crisis intervention to homes, hospitals, 
  schools, community centers, and clubs. In addition, individual, family, and 
  group counseling is available and a hot line for children and families in need 
  of psycho-social advice and/or counseling has been set up through the DCI/PS 
  offices in Ramallah and Hebron. 
<p>The project is being implemented with the assistance of numerous Palestinian 
  governmental and non-governmental organizations, and with the support of UNICEF. 
  DCI/PS continues to seek additional support for the project. 
<p>The project is currently seeking trained social workers and psychologists to 
  volunteer in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<h3>Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group</h3>
<b>The closure of Gaza International Airport threatens medical assistance to Palestinians 
</b> 
<p>Dr. Marwan al-Za'eem, Director of Public Relations in the Palestinian Ministry 
  of Health confirmed that several Arab countries sent medical assistance to the 
  PA since the eruption of the al-Aqsa Uprising. He told the PHRMG that "we received 
  medication and medical equipment from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, 
  Emirates and Qatar" 
<p>He clarified that those medications and equipment help hospitals in the PA's 
  areas to carry out their responsibilities, especially with regards to serious 
  injuries that occurred in the clashes because of the Israeli gunfire and sophisticated 
  weapons. 
<p>Planes that bring in this medical assistance usually return with seriously 
  injured Palestinians on board, because they need special medical care that local 
  hospitals cannot offer, due to the lack of facilities and equipment. Planes 
  coming from Arab States used to land in Gaza International Airport, but after 
  the decision of the Israeli government on October 7, 2000 to close it, planes 
  now land in al-Areesh Egyptian airport (south of the Gaza Strip) and trucks 
  transport the cargo into Gaza. 
<p>Dr. al-Za'eem added: "Of course, Israel delays the entrance of the medical 
  assistance on the border, which in turn delays the arrival of the medications 
  to hospitals, and this delay could expose the lives of the seriously wounded 
  Palestinian youths to death". He explained: "The Ministry of Health doesn't 
  suffer lack of medications or professional staff, on the contrary, it has a 
  reserve of medication sufficient for three months, according to the plan prepared 
  by the Ministry". But he pointed out that: "The toll of people being killed 
  and injured by the Israeli army is huge, which threatens to use up the precautionary 
  medications of the Ministry. Nevertheless, Arab assistance is very much appreciated 
  and would help pass this critical time". 
<p>Attached you will find a table of planes carrying medical assistance that are 
  expected to arrive in the next days at Gaza International Airport. 
<p>The PHRMG calls upon the Israeli authorities to respect its humanitarian duties 
  and to permit aircraft carrying medical assistance to land in Gaza International 
  Airport. Furthermore, we call upon the international community to continue its 
  pressures on the State of Israel to ensure that international humanitarian law 
  be respected throughout the Occupied Palestinian territories.
