<b>Weekly Press Review </b>

 

<p>
Druze Leaders are Calling for Canceling the Mandatory 
Military Service:


Many journalists and columnists wrote this week about the Druze 
community.<p>
The issue was brought up again after the testimonies of the young 
Druze soldier who is the suspect in killing Rami Garah in “Black 
October” clashes. Rami Garah’s father attacked this boarder 
patrolman at the first session of the Or Commission (see weekly 
press review No.20). 
<p>
The male members of the Druze community are subjected to 
mandatory military service in the IDF since 1950. 
Many Druze leaders are working those days on preparing a 
conference to demand cancellation of the mandatory military 
service. Jehad Saed, a member of the Druze Committee declared 
on Tuesday’s edition of Al-Ittihad (February 27): “it is very 
important those days to have an abolition from the military service 
in the IDF, and make it as an optional or voluntary service. We 
are going to sign petitions and send it to different officials”. 
<p>
Amir Makhul in Al-Sinnara Friday’s edition suggests “a civilized 
project: no Arabic conscript in IDF”. Amir distinguishes between 
two cases: the youngster of the Druze community who are 
bounded to serve in IDF, and Muslim and Christian youngsters 
who are collectively exempted from it.” Moreover, Amir stress 
on the fact that: “we do not need an Investigation Committee in 
order to know the truth, but we should remember that the killer is 
one of us, and that it is our weakness which we must prevent it in 
the future. Without this act, the boarders inside our community 
will widen and the government mission will be much easier in 
getting away from responsibility”. (Al-Sinnara, March 2nd). 
<p>
Al-Ittihad and Panorama Friday’s editions present the same point 
of view from different voices. Salah Dabaj in his report in Al-
Ittihad brings the Martyrs’ Families Committee’s announcement: 
“the media’s attempt to divide us under affiliation or sectarian is 
very impertinent. From our point of view, the police and the 
government are the suspects in this case”.<p>
Sameh Al-Kasem in Dabaj’s report defines the military service as 
a political, Zionism process, which its main target is to affect our 
people solidarity”. 
<p>
The poet Salman Nator clarify the fact: “that the Druze are Arab 
Palestinian, who must continue struggling until we get free from 
the tragedy of 1956”. <p>
Natour claims as well: “most of the Druze refuse military service 
by humane, ethical and initial position. Those who came back 
home after three years of service, physically and mentally healthy, 
his suffer will grow the minute he feels the racial, national and 
sectarian discrimination in his daily life”. (Al-Ittihad, March 2nd). 
<p>
Suhil Kblan refers to the same issue, but he focuses on the Or 
Commission, where the Druze soldier testify in front of the whole 
world, where the snipers of the special anti-terrorist police (Jews), 
testified behind a shield…” (Al-Ittihad, March 2nd). 
<p>
Salman Kheir, an attorney, declared in Panorama: “I refuse the 
use of Druze expression, the soldiers are soldiers of the 
government and they receive instructions from the army they 
serve in.” (Panorama, March 2nd). 
<p>
Druze leaders usually stress the military service imposed on them 
to legitimate their demands for equal rights, but It is more clear 
that the Druze Community is feeling outcasts from the Jewish 
Israeli society. <p>More Facts Regarding Education in the Negev 
communities:<br>

Another subject of concern reflected the Arabic press this week 
is the education in the Negev and in the unrecognized villages. 
Again Kull Al-Arab and Al-Ittihad revealed almost the same 
numbers, which were reported in August 2000. 
Maekel Al-Hwashli, education council of the unrecognized 
villages says: “we need more than 22 high school, cause there 
isn’t any school in any of the 45 villages, in spite the fact that the 
inhabitant’s number at this villages is up to 70 thousand. (Al-
Ittihad, March 2nd). Moreover, just 9000 pupils continue their 
education, cause 60% of 32798 students drop out of school.
Al-Hwashli gives an example from his village, only 1 teacher was 
graduated over the 20 past years, and there is no one finished his 
high school education for the last 3 years. 
Amal Al-Sana’ co-coordinator of the Orientation Committee for 
the Education of the Negev Arabs, declared: “the unconcern and 
the obliviousness by the government is its way to achieve two 
goals: ignorance which make the control over them much easier, 
and the second one is avoiding investment in order to force people 
leaving their lands”. (Al-Ittihad, March 2nd). 
<p>
Yaser Al-Aqbi’s report in Kull Al-Arab reveals some very 
frightening facts about the Bedouin youth. “50% of the Bedouin 
Delinquents are youth under the age of 18”. 
Yitzhak Ahronovitch, police commander of the Southern District 
said that 4254 criminal files were open in 2000, which is 20.5 % of 
the whole criminal files in the south. Ahronovitch warn from a 
Bedouin Intifada (upraising) very soon, if the situation continues 
the way it is now”. (Kull Al-Arab, March 2nd). 
<p>
Swat Al-Haqq Wal-Hurriya, reported only the meeting which was 
held in the Knesset last Tuesday. The Education Committee in the 
Knesset decided to build kindergartens inside the neighborhoods, 
and the Bedouin Education Authority declared its well to repair 
the rugged roads for the students”. (March 2nd). <p>A New Palestinian Feminine Council:
<p>
In the wake of the horrifying clashes that have occurred last 
October, the women’s absence was very notified. There was a 
very strong need for women’s rule inside this clashes in different 
ways. <p>
Nehaia Dawod, a lecturer in the Hebrew University in Jerusalem: 
“The political oppression of the Arabic women is a result of a 
social oppression”. “It is not a reasonable to have only male 
leaders at the beginning of the 21 century”. (Al-Ein, February 27). 
<p>
Fasel Al-Maqal reported that the first meeting of this council: 
“took place on last Friday – Saturday in Saint Gabriel Hotel in 
Nazareth. 150 women participated in this meeting under the title 
“women are taking decisions”.<p> 
Afnan Ajbaria, a teacher reported that: “Academic, working and 
housekeepers women gathered from all over the Arab towns and 
villages and from different parties, in order to participate in taking 
decisions”. (Fasel Al-Maqal, March 2nd). 
<p>
Al-Sinnara’s Friday edition gave a full coverage of this meeting. 
Amna Abu-Rass tried to summaries some of the important 
decisions: “The council will try to have an active rule inside the 
Follow-Up Committee, the Arabic Municipalities and the parents 
committees. Moreover the council will support each woman who 
decide to participate in any election”.
Arien Hwari, Women Human Rights programme Coordinator, 
shed a light on the Arab Association for Human Rights’ research 
regarding working women and she stress the fact that the council 
will deal with new ideas and new issues as well”. (Al-Sinnara, 
March 2nd). <p>The Supreme Court’s Decision regarding the Shbrentzak 
Area of Nazareth:
<p>
“The Supreme Court obliges Ministry of Interior to appoint a state 
Committee in order to solve the problem of the Shbrentzak area in 
Nazareth”. (Sawt Al-Haqq Wal-Hurriya, March 2nd). 
<p>
Panorama stress the fact:” that the municipality needs this area 
very badly in order to solve the housing problem in Nazareth. 
Moreover, the area has no geographic relation to Natzrat Illit, and 
it receives its infrastructure services from the Nazareth 
municipality”. (March 2nd). 
<p>
“Natzrat Illit is extended for about 34,000 dunam (land measure 
–1000sq. meters) with an about 45,000 citizens, while Nazareth is 
extended for about 14,500 dunam, with 70,000 citizens”. (Al-
Ittihad, March 2nd).<p>Tarshiha’s Land:<br>

Nakhla Tanus, a member in the local council of Tarshiha (a village 
in Upper Galilee), wrote to Arab MKs in order to help him in the 
council’s appeal to Ministry of Interior. 
“The council is trying to join back the Dabshi’s land which was 
taking from its area to Kfar Hvradim” (Panorama, March 2nd). 
<p>
“It is worth mentioning that MK Natan Sharnzki appointed a 
committee in order to discuss this problem and to extend the 
village’s territory from west, instead of doing that to Kfar 
Hvradim, which was built on Tarshiha’s expropriated lands”. 
(Ayyam Al-Arab, Friday 18).

<h3> <a name="sjp">Students for Justice in Palestine
</a></h3>
<b>Stand up to ethnic cleansing<br>


Students to Construct Palestinian Refugee Camp on UC Berkeley 
Campus<br>


Demand for UC Divestment Continues</b>

<p>
 In solidarity with one of the world's

oldest and 

largest refugee populations, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)

will construct a Palestinian refugee camp on the UC Berkeley 
campus.
<p>
On Wednesday, March 7, 2001, from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm, by 
Dwinelle

Hall, near Bancroft and Telegraph, SJP will rally in support of

Palestinian rights and demand that the UC divest from Israel
<p>

In response to the ongoing occupation and escalating military violence

against the Palestinian civilian population, SJP will reiterate its

demand that the University of California (UC) sever its financial ties

to the Israeli government. The UC invests at least $6.2 billion of its

$59 billion endowment in companies with sizeable operations in Israel.

Some of these investments directly support the Israeli military,

responsible for over 400 Palestinian civilian deaths since September

2000. One such investment is in General Electric. The UC invests $650

million in General Electric, which produces propulsion systems for

Israeli aircraft, such as the AH-64 Apache assault helicopters used

strike Palestinian villages with missiles. This direct connection

between the University and Israel's occupation and Apartheid against

Palestinians is unacceptable. Our public universities should not be

investing in occupation and massacres of civilians and SJP demands

that the UC immediately divest from all such companies.
<p>

The event on Wednesday, March 7, will dramatically portray the

dispossession and entrapment of the Palestinian refugees, displaced

since 1948, and now numbering over 4 million. During and after the

1948 establishment of the Israeli state, Zionist forces expelled

nearly 800,000 Palestinians out of an approximate 1.2 million

indigenous Palestinian population in a process that today would be

called ethnic cleansing.

<p>
These refugees and their descendants account for one of the world's

largest and oldest refugee populations. To date, over 3.7 million are

registered by the United Nations and another 2 million unregistered

Palestinian refugees live in neighboring countries or in internal

refugee camps sometimes within a very short distance of their original

homes and properties.
<p>

Israel's refusal to allow these refugees to return to their homes is

in violation of the Geneva Conventions, the Universal Declaration of

Human Rights, and UN Resolution 194 (1948), which specifically

addresses the rights of the Palestinian refugees. In light of the

Israeli "Law of Return" (Hak Ha Shevut), which grants Israeli

citizenship to all Jewish people worldwide wishing to immigrate to

Palestine, Israel's refusal to allow the Palestinian refugees to

return to their own homes can only be described as the continuation of

an ethnic cleansing policy and unabashed Apartheid.


<p>SJP is a diverse coalition of students, faculty, and community members

at the University of California, Berkeley with an interest in the

human rights of the Palestinian people and their struggle for

liberation under Israeli occupation. SJP also seeks to raise

publicawareness in the United States about the plight of the

Palestinian refugees. SJP conducts education, programming, information

distribution, and other coordinated efforts in order to counterbalance

anti-Palestinian biases in the American media

<b>EYEWITNESS REPORT:ISRAELI ARMY and SETTLERS SHOOT to KILL UNARMED 
PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS</b>




<p>
The Israeli army and settlers are increasingly and purposefully

targeting Palestinian civilian areas located in the vicinity of

illegal Israeli settlements, causing numerous deaths and injuries. 

This past week, a nine-year old boy was shot and killed while in his

bedroom, a woman was shot and killed while shopping with her 
family,

and a fifty-four year old man was killed by a rocket which was shot

into his home.

<p>
On March 2, 2001, nine-year old Obei Mohammed Darraj was killed as he

was helping his father paint a window frame at home. The Palestine

Monitor team visited the boy's family on March 4, 2001. Obei's father

confirmed that there had been no exchange of fire between Palestinians

and the Israeli army and settlers that day. The bullet that entered

the little boy's chest and exited from his back, was fired from the

illegal settlement of Psagot. Another bullet also entered the family's

living room.   Upon seeing his son collapse, Obei's father called an

ambulance but couldn¹t bear the pain of seeing his son bleeding to

death while he waited, so he decided to carry him to the hospital

himself. At 3:30 the boy was declared dead.

<p>
On March 3, 2001 at around 7:30 pm, Aida Daoud Moussa Fatiha was shot

dead next to the Quakers' Boys' Friends school by a 50-caliber,

anti-tank bullet fired from the illegal Israeli settlement of Psagot.

Aida Fatiha was walking in the street with her husband and children,

shopping in preparation for the Eid feast when she was killed. While

the settlement is relatively far from the mid-town area where Aida

Fatiha was shot dead, the type of guns and ammunition used by the

Israeli army against Palestinian civilians have an extremely long

range.

<p>
On March 4, 2001, the Palestine Monitor team visited the house of

54-year old Mohammed Badarin of Ramallah who was killed by an Israeli

rocket on February 27, 2001 as he was sitting in his living room.

Mohammed Baradin leaves behind a family of ten children.  The day the

shelling happened, there were some clashes between Palestinian youth

and the Israeli army at the City Inn Hotel and Beit Eil settlement

intersection. According to his brother, unusually heavy rounds of

bullets were fired into Palestinian residential areas facing the

nearby Israeli settlement of Beit Eil. The shooting was coming from

three different directions and civilians were caught in the crossfire

for an hour and a half, starting at 6 pm.

<p>
At 8:30 pm that same evening, Israeli tanks starting firing rockets at

the house of Mohammed Badarin, although the clashes had stopped an

hour before. An Israeli rocket hit Mohammed Badarin as he was sitting

in his living room. The rest of the family was dispersed in different

rooms, some of the men were attempting to remove cooking gas canisters

from the kitchen for fear that they would be hit by subsequent

shelling. According to testimonies by his family, Mohammed Badarin's

body was torn into several pieces. The Palestine Monitor team noticed

numerous pools of blood splattered over the walls and ceiling of the

living room. Shortly afterwards, the second floor of the Badarin

family's house was hit by a second rocket, although clashes had long

stopped by that time.
<p>

The Badarins¹ home is severely damaged and uninhabitable.  The façade

of the home is riddled with hundreds of bullet holes and there are

two-meter wide holes on each of the floors of the house.  Bullets and

rockets entered the home, causing severe damage to its contents.  The

Badarin family now has to sleep on makeshift beds on the floor,

scattered in the house's corridors. There are no longer any rooms that

can be utilized, except for the kitchen which has windows pierced by

several bullet holes.

<p>
On this same night of shelling, the nearby Ministry of Local Councils

was also hit by several hundred bullets and by a rocket, which

completely destroyed the top floor.

</a></h3>
<b>The Intifada Between Stability and Anarchy</b>


<p>When Sharon forms his aggressive unity government with Peres,

confrontation between the Israeli government, on the one hand, and 
the

PNA and the Palestinian people, on the other hand, becomes 
inevitable.

<p>This confrontation will be the result of the conflicting visions of

the peace process and its components. A brief revision of these

components will show us the gap that stands between the Palestinian

position and the Israeli one. Sharon’s government will still make the

gap less bridgeable. First: The Israeli position The terms of

reference of the peace process Sharon’s position vis-à-vis the peace

process puts an end to whatever has been agreed up in terms of

agreements or achievements. He thinks that agreements signed following

the Oslo Accord failed to achieve peace. In his view, this failure is

the result of the application of the international legality and the

principle of land for peace. The sponsorship of the peace process

Sharon sees no need for any kind of sponsorship including that of the

UN or even that of the US. Violence and terrorism Sharon claims that

there will be no negotiations unless “violence” stops. Security for

the Israelis comes first, and, in his view, this opens the way to

peace. The fait accompli To legitimize and, therefore, prolong the

Israeli occupation, Sharon suggests a long transitional phase. On this

basis, he writes off the Camp David and Taba negotiations concerning

the final status solution. He also stands against Clinton’s proposals

which dealt with sensitive issues such as the refugees, Jerusalem and

settlements. Second: The Palestinian position Terms of reference of

the peace process Palestinians will continue to adhere to

international legality which is in line with their national rights.

Although the Oslo Accord expired on May 4, 1999, negotiations have not

ceased. The Accord itself was based on UN resolutions 242 & 338 and

the principle of land for peace. These resolutions call for ending the

Israeli occupation including the full withdrawal of Israeli troops and

settlers from the territories occupied in 1967 including East

Jerusalem. UN Resolution 252 considers East Jerusalem an occupied Arab

territory. Other important UN resolutions include 465 which considers

Israeli settlements illegal, 194 which calls for giving the

Palestinian refugees the right to return and to be compensated for

their suffering, and 181which calls for the establishment of a

Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. The sponsorship of

the peace process The Madrid peace conference was held under the

sponsorship of the United States and the then-USSR. The collapse of

the USSR allowed the US to monopolize the process although signing the

Oslo Accord was made with the participation of some international

forces such as the European Union, Japan and some Arab countries.

Denis Ross and Martin Indyk represented this monopoly and they never

failed to achieve Isaac Shameer’s promise to make negotiations with

the Palestinians last for ten years without giving them any of their

rights. The Intifada as a way of confronting the Zionist aggression

The Intifada erupted as a public expression against the attempts of

Clinton and Barak to impose their proposals. Sharon’s visit to al-Aqsa

mosque was only the last straw element. The killing of Palestinians in

al-Aqsa premises by the Israeli troops made the Intifada spread to

other Palestinian territories including some of those occupied in

1948. The Israeli barbaric reaction was condemned by many countries,

and the PNA did not accept Barak’s call for a mutual cessation of

“violence”. Barak who first refused to negotiate “under fire”, found

his way back to the negotiating table. Sharon in his turn calls for

putting an end to the Intifada before sitting at the negotiating table

to negotiate a proposal that Palestinians have already rejected.

Sharon’s intransigence imposes on us a long war of liberation. The

fait accompli Taking into account Sharon’s terms for negotiations, the

region will witness some changes because of the aggressive approach of

Sharon’s government. This government should be isolated and boycotted

since it is impossible to negotiate with a government that does not

recognize UN resolutions as a basis for the peace process. And imposes

a blockade on our cities and villages. An end should be put to Israeli

assassinations and the use of internationally banned gas. Also, the US

monopoly on the peace process should come to an end to allow the UN to

play a much more effective role. Finally, no negotiations can be

started until the international investigation committee (Mitchel’s

Committee) decides who is the aggressor and condemns Israel’s criminal

acts. The international community is asked to provide protection for

the Palestinian people to ensure the continuation of the negotiations.

Future developments will be affected not only by Sharon’s aggressive

plans but also by how the PNA is going to confront these plans and how

it will employ the Intifada to defeat Israeli plans. To do so, the PNA

should take into account the following factors: The double language of

Sharon’s aggression government Sharon will use the defense minister as

the sword of deterrence and Peres as the branch of olive that

symbolizes peace. The resulting double discourse may entice those

Palestinians who favour to negotiate with Peres. They will justify

this tendency by citing the economic hardships and the deterioration

in the security situation that our people are suffering from. They

will also claim that by negotiation with Peres they can call the bluff

of Sharon. On the other hand, national and Islamic forces will

continue the Intifada despite the difficulties our people are living.

They will also stand against any dealing with Sharon’s government. If

the Israelis mange to coordinate their conflicting positions, we

should adhere to our basic principles. President Arafat’s statement

following Taba’s negotiations embodies the position that national and

Islamic forces have so far adopted. Any deviation from that position

which may be made by those who favour negotiations, is likely to

endanger our national unity. A united position by the PNA, the

national and Islamic forces, and the institutions of the civil society

will strengthen our Intifada against the Israeli occupation. This will

affect stability in the region as long as we are denied our rights.

Racial menace Barak attempts to weaken the Palestinian resolve has

failed especially when he thought he could subdue the PNA following

the Camp David negotiations. However, further deterioration will occur

if Sharon’s threats are carried out. The Israeli prime minister is

governed by his past actions. The man who stood behind the massacres

of Qibya, Sabra and Shatila is now threatening to reoccupy the PNA

territories and to assassinate Palestinians leaders. These threats

coincide with Israel’s tightening of its blockade of our cities and

villages. The blockade includes closing crossing points, preventing

people from getting in or out of their cities or villages, and banning

the import of food. Israel has also refused to transfer to the PNA

millions of dollars in taxes. These threats are aimed at pushing the

PNA to the verge of collapse. If such an aim is achieved, then anarchy

will prevail not only at the Palestinian level but also at the

regional level. US air strikes against Iraq will increase

deterioration. This racial menace has frightened some Israelis who

warned against the effects of such an approach on Israel at the

strategic level. A united front that consists of Arab and Islamic

countries is the only answer to the menace posed by Sharon and his

aggression government. Financial support should be increased to

strengthen the Intifada against the Israeli occupation. The key to the

stability or instability should remain in our hand. The concentrated

campaign against corruption Nobody denies that corruption exists at

the administrative, financial and moral levels. However, the worst

form of corruption is the presence among us of collaborators who help

the Israeli occupation murder some of our activists. The PNA has taken

certain steps towards the elimination of this kind of corruption.

Administrative corruption leads to both financial and moral

corruption. Despite the formation of some administrative reform

committees, corruption continues to result in a certain degree of

malfunction that characterizes the general performance of the PNA.

Self-immunity against corruption requires further administrative

reform to ensure a better, if not a more creative, performance of each

working individual. It also requires the removal of any power centers

that result from occupying a certain position for an indefinite period

of time. Conflicts among such power centers will distort the image of

the PNA. Having the right person in the right position will also help

maintain a stronger administrative structure. It is important to note

here that the continuation of the Intifada can only be guaranteed

through the ‘clean’ performance of the PNA. Revolution Until Victory.

<h3> <a name="uhwc">Union of Health Work Committees
</a></h3>


<p>Dear Friends 
<p>
The present situation in the Palestinian Occupied territories is
determined by two dimensions; the escalation of the Israeli 
pressure
on the Palestinians to submit to political concessions, and the
ability of the Palestinians to withstand the pressure and not to
surrender. In this frame the Health Work Committees is doing its
utmost to withstand the pressure. However we have to admit; it 
hurts.
What we have been going through in the last weeks is very hard to
describe and at the same time is very hard to imagine. The siege 
and
the closures are suffocating our work, especially in the villages. We
still go there no matter how much the Israeli Occupation forces are
tightening the noose. Admittedly it is very difficult for the medical
team to carry the medical equipment over the mountains of rubble and
blockades, and it is sometimes dangerous. But  still we go. Maybe the
translation of some of the headlines of the Palestinian newspapers can
give some insight.
<br><br>
12.2.?2001

<b>THOUSANDS RALLY WORLDWIDE TO DEMAND REFUGEES' 
RIGHT TO RETURN </b>
<p>
On 7 April 2001, thousands of Palestinians and people of 
conscience

will take part in marches and rallies to demand implementation of 
the

right of Palestinian refugees to return to homes and lands from 
which

theywere expelled.

<p>
Marches and rallies will take place in New York (US) and other 
cities

including those in Palestine, Canada, Spain and Australia. 
Protestors

will call for an end to five decades of exile and demand that

Palestinian refugees be permitted to return to their properties and

homes of origin. These events will coincide with the fifty-third

anniversary of the massacre of Palestinian civilians committed by

Zionist forces in the village of Deir Yassin.

<p>
Organizers intend to draw the public's attention to the human rights

abuses and suffering inflicted on the Palestinian people. They also

plan to send a strong signal of support to Palestinians in territories

occupied since 1948 and 1967. More than three hundred and fifty

Palestinian civilians have been killed, and over 11,000 injured by

Israeli occupation forces in the past few months. Many of those

injured and killed are children.

<p>
The April 7 marches and rallies follow from those successfully held in

September 2000 simultaneously in Washington DC, London, Lebanon and

Palestine. These events, spearheaded by Al-Awda, The Palestine Right

to Return Coalition, are co-sponsored and endorsed by thousands of

individuals and over one hundred and fifty organizations.

<p>
Palestinian refugees, numbering more than 5 million in this year 2001,

represent one of the oldest and largest refugee populations in the

world. Their suffering is magnified by Israel's ongoing denial of

their right to repatriation and restitution, as required by

international law and UN Resolution 194.


<p>Among the confirmed speakers for the forthcoming rally in New York

City are Dr. Souheil Natour, Muna Hamze, Dr. Sami el-Aryan, Rafael

Cancel Miranda, Sarah Flounders and son of Deir Yassin massacre

survivors Abbas Hamidah. The rally will also include a statement by

George Habash former Secretary General of the Popular Front for the

Liberation of Palestine. Internationally renowned musicians Marcel

Khalife and Simon Shaheen have been invited to take part.
