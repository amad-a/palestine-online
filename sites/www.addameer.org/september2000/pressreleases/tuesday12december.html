<p><b> The Israeli occupation forces carry out an assassination: 
Occupation forces shell Deir El-Balah and Khan Yunis and sweep more 
areas of agricultural land</b></p>
 
<p>
This morning, at about 8:30 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
opened fire from their tanks at the Palestinian-Egyptian border in 
Rafah. They shot at a number of children who were near their houses in 
Al-Salam neighborhood, adjacent to the borderline. PCHR’s field 
officer in Rafah reported that the child Mohammed El-Satari, 13 years 
old, was wounded with shrapnel in the leg. He added that the area was 
not witnessing any clashes when the Israeli occupation forces shot at 
these children. 
<p>
Yesterday afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces shot dead Anwar 
Mahmoud Hamran, 28 years old, from the village of A’rrabeh in Jenin. 
Hamran, a student at the Al-Quds Open University, was near the campus 
at about 13:30 local time when the Israeli occupation forces opened 
sniper fire at him from a military post of these forces on Jerzim 
Mount, 1000 meters away from the campus. Nineteen bullets hit him 
throughout his body. Field information asserts that the incident was a 
cold-blooded assassination of Hamran. 
<p>
PCHR condemns this crime of assassination and regards the recurrent 
assassinations and extra-judicial killings committed by the Israeli 
occupation forces as highly dangerous. 
<p>
More Sweeping of Agricultural Land 
<p>
Yesterday evening, at about 21:00, the Israeli occupation forces swept 
more areas of agricultural land to the north of a road branching from 
Salah El-Din Street (the main road between the north and south of the 
Gaza Strip) leading to Gush Qatif settlement bloc. The affected areas 
are 800 meters away from Al-Matahen junction in the middle area of the 
Gaza Strip. The sweeping lasted until 2:00 local time this morning. 
It included: 1) A 40-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
palms and guavas, owned by Salem Mohammed Abu Shmas. In addition, an 
irrigation network was destroyed. 2) A 10-donum area of agricultural 
land planted with vegetables, owned by Jehad Abu Madhi. 3) A 
three-donum area of agricultural land on which three greenhouses 
planted with vegetables were established, owned by Mohammed Abu 
Nahyeh. In addition, an irrigation network, a well and a water pump 
were destroyed. 
<p>
Also yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces swept more areas 
of agricultural land to the south of Dogit settlement in the north of 
Beit Lahia. The sweeping included: 1) A five-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with citrus, owned by Ahmed Hassan 
El-Shanti. 2) A two-donum area of agricultural land on which two 
greenhouses planted with vegetables were established, owned by the 
above citizen. 3) A three-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, palms and citrus, owned by brothers Suhail and Nasri Shukri 
El-Souri. In addition, an 80-square-meter building that included a 
well and an agricultural equipment store was destroyed. 
<p>
Shelling of Deir El-Balah and Khan Yunis 
<p>
Yesterday, at approximately 20:00 local time, the Israeli occupation 
forces positioned in a military post in the western part of Kfar Darom 
fired heavy and medium bullets at houses in Deir El-Balah. The firing 
lasted until midnight. The houses that were hit are 250-300 meters to 
the west of military posts of the Israeli occupation forces. This 
attack caused severe damages to the following houses: 1) The house of 
Ali Mohammed Abu Qassem, a 400-square-meter, two-story house in which

Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 16:00 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces positioned at Al-Tuffah roadblock fired a number of 
artillery shells at houses in the west of the refugee camp of Khan 
Yunis. These houses are always shelled and so their residents had left 
them in recent weeks. The Israeli occupation forces also fired heavy 
and medium bullets at Palestinian civilians and houses. As a result, 
Salem Ali Salem Abu Obeida, 25 years old, was wounded with a live 
bullet in the right leg, and Khalil Mohammed Al-Najjar, 37 years old, 
was wounded with shrapnel from a shell in the back. PCHR’s field 
officer in Khan Yunis reported that the two were passing the area. In

PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to 
immediately intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian 
civilians. PCHR calls in particular for: 
<p>
1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in 
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and 
killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians. 2. Convening a conference of the High 
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure 
Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Convention. 3. 
Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the 
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces. 4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights. 5. Providing 
humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose 
living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the 
continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
entire occupied Palestinian territories. 6. Use by the international 
community and relevant bodies, including ICRC, of necessary measures 
to ensure the access of medical supplies and equipment and other 
humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. The Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to deny entry of this material 
through Rafah Border Crossing (into the Gaza Strip).

A Young Man fatally shot in el Khader
                          Village
                                   December 12 2000 </b></p>
 
<p>
Today, Youssef Ahmed Abu Sawi (28) was shot dead in el Khader
village
by the Israeli security forces. According to information garnered by
LAW, Sawi was standing outside his home when a barrage of
shots were
fired in his direction. Sawi’s body was riddled with bullets and he
died immediately.
<p>
In Rafah in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers reportedly fired upon a
group of children from an armored vehicle wounding Mohammed el
Satri.
<p>
Yesterday morning Israeli security forces broke into the house of
Khaleel Abu Fanoona in the el Hara’ik neighbourhood on the southern
outskirts of Hebron. Israeli security personnel ordered Fanoona and
his family to vacate the top floor of their home and eventually used
force to vacate persons and property. The house has been effectively
turned into a military outpost with fifteen soldiers camped in and
around the property. Fanoona has a family of 13 who were all
reportedly taunted and humiliated by the soldiers.
<p>
LAW once again calls on the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth
Geneva Convention to ensure Israel’s compliance with the provisions of
the Convention.
<p>
LAW once again calls on Israel to abide by international guidelines
concerned with the use of force by law enforcement officials.
