<b>Israeli interrogators torture Palestinian detainees at Asqalan prison</b>



<p>
Israeli Shabak (the Israeli General Security Apparatus) interrogators
used torture against two Palestinian detainees at Asqalan prison.
The
detainees were subjected to shabih (bound and blindfolded), sleep
deprivation, being drenched in cold water, death threats and abusive
language.
<p>
Ayman Al Ajluni a 28 year-old father of three from Hebron currently
detained at the Russian Compound, told LAW Society’s lawyer
Labib
Habib that he had been arrested from his home in the area of
Hebron
still under Israeli control on 20 December 2000. He was taken to
Hebron’s Al Majnuna detention center before being transferred to
Asqalan for 17 days. Then he was taken to Al Jalami prison, where
he
spent seven days before being taken to the Russian Compound
detention
center.
<p>
El Ajluni stated that the Asqalan prison interrogators used torturous
methods for the first five days. During interrogation, he was forced
to sit blindfolded on a tiny chair with his hands bound behind his
back. He was prevented from sleeping, threatened with death and
subjected to abusive language.
<p>
Yunis Al Atrash, a 41 year-old father of 12 also from Hebron, told
LAW’s lawyer that special Israeli forces broke into his house in
Israeli-controlled Hebron on 8 January 2001, carried out a thorough
search and took him to Asqalan prison.
<p>
Al Atrash stated that Shabak interrogators at Asqalan prison used
torturous methods during the first five days of his detention. Al
Atrash was forced to sit blindfolded on a tiny chair with his hands
bound behind his back. He was drenched in icy water and subjected to
abusive language.
<p>
On15 January 2001, LAW learnt from the office of the Israeli Attorney
General that an investigation into allegations of torture brought
forward by Rami Iz'oul, an 18-year-old Palestinian detainee, would not
be carried out, under the pretext that it was not a matter of "public
interest". The Israeli Attorney’s letter came in response to a
complaint filed by LAW, through attorney Labib Habib, with the
Department for Investigation of Police Misconduct on 3 December 2000.
LAW had demanded an investigation into Iz'oul ’s interrogation.
<p>
Rami Iz'oul was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his home in the West
Bank village of Husan near Bethlehem on 30 October 2000 and has been
in detention since. Iz'oul claims that he was beaten and had ice cold
water poured over his head during interrogation. Due to the torture,
Iz'oul was hospitalized for one night in Jerusalem’s Hadassa hospital.
The 18-year-old reported that after being discharged from the hospital
he was beaten again and threatened into signing a false confession.
<p>
On 6 September 1999, the Israeli High Court issued a judgment
outlawing specific interrogation methods amounting to torture. The
High Court further stated that a reasonable interrogation was
necessarily one free of torture, cruel and inhuman treatment. The
Court highlighted that "brutal and inhuman means" were prohibited
during interrogation and that human dignity includes the dignity of
the suspect being interrogated.
<p>
LAW believes that the practices used during the interrogation of Rami
Iz'oul amount to "brutal and inhuman means" and are therefore in
contradiction of the High Court ruling of 6 September 1999.
<p>
For this reason, LAW maintains that an investigation into the
allegations of torture brought forward by Rami Iz'oul is of the utmost
importance and will further pursue the issue with the Israeli State
Prosecutor's Office. LAW is concerned that if a proper investigation
into the case is not carried out, Israeli interrogators will see it as
a signal that acts of torture and ill treatment will go unpunished.

<p>Under international law, interrogation methods that constitute torture
or ill treatment are absolutely prohibited and subject to universal
jurisdiction.

<b>Two Israeli verdicts unveil discrimination against
Palestinians</b>




    <p>                             
On 21 January 2001, two Israeli courts pronounced two different
verdicts, one sentencing a Jewish settler to 6 months’ community
service and a 70,000 Shekel (approx US $17,500) fine for the
beating
to death of a Palestinian child, and the other sentencing a
Palestinian girl who tried to stab a Jewish settler (resulting in
light wounds) to 6 and a half years’ imprisonment.
<p>
The Jerusalem Criminal Court pronounced the first verdict against
36
year-old settler Nahum Kurman, former head of security in the Bitar
Elit settlement for beating to death 11 year-old Hilmi Shusheh from
Husan village near Bethlehem.
<p>
On the same day, an Israeli Court sentenced 17 year-old
Palestinian
Su’ad Ghazal from Sibastia village near Nablus, to six and a half
years’ imprisonment for trying to stab a Jewish settler from the Shfi
Shamron settlement.
<p>
According to information gathered by LAW, at around 14:30 on Sunday 27
October 1996, Hilmi was playing with friends near his house adjacent
to bypass road no. 60. A blue jeep stopped, and Nahum Kurman got out
of the jeep and chased the children until he caught Hilmi. He kicked
and beat the child all over his body, using his arms and a weapon.
Afterwards Hilmi was taken to a nearby Israeli military camp, and then
to the Hadasa Ein Karem Hospital, where he died.
<p>
Tahreer Muhammad Hilmi, who was with Hilmi Shusheh, said, “while we
were walking down the road with Hilmi and other boys, we saw a jeep
driving very quickly towards us. We stepped aside, and a man jumped
from the jeep and chased us. He caught Hilmi and beat him till he fell
to the ground. Then he kicked Hilmi in the face and head before
putting his boot on Hilmi’s neck and hitting Hilmi’s forehead with his
gun. I panicked and started screaming until two or three women
arrived. One of them carried Hilmi to the settler’s car, shouting at
him to take him to hospital or a doctor for treatment. The settler
took him to the entrance of the Bitar Elit settlement.”
<p>
The child’s uncle, Muhammad Yousef, said, “ I got to where Hilmi was
lying on the ground with Israeli security officers trying to help him.
I heard them saying he was dead, so they brought an unequipped
ambulance. At that time, Hilmi was in a coma, with severe bruising on
his face.”
<p>
Israeli soldiers arrested Suad Ghazal on 13 December 1998, near the
Shfi Shamron settlement close to her village. According to a female
settler, Suad had tried to stab her. Suad was taken to the Qadomim
settlement police station where she was interrogated. Ghazal was later
transferred to Ramle prison where she was held in solitary confinement
for 17 days before being moved to a cell with four Palestinian
detainees. Suad was only 15 years old when she was arrested.
<p>
In light of the above, LAW confirms the following:
1.The above verdicts reflect discrimination in the sentencing handed
down by Israeli courts. 2.The verdict against the settler may
encourage other settlers to commit similar crimes against Palestinian
citizens.

<b>AN ASSESSMENT OF US INVOLVEMENT in the Palestinian-
Israeli Peace
Process Over the Last Seven Years</b>



<p>
Prepared by the Legal Unit of the PLO Negotiations Affairs
Department, 20 January 2001
<p>
No third party has been as involved and influential in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process over the last seven years as the
United States and, in particular, its Special Middle East
Coordinator,
Dennis Ross.  In view of the United States' inability to facilitate
the realization by Palestinians and Israelis of a just and lasting
peace in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 242 and
338 and
other sources of international law, it seems prudent, at the close of
the Clinton Administration, to assess US involvement and to identify
some of the reasons the United States' involvement has not yielded
better results.
<p>
PROCESS OVER SUBSTANCE
<p>
Under US supervision, the Palestinian-Israeli "peace process" has
become a goal in and of itself.  A false sense of normalcy has been
created because of the on-going process of negotiations.  The lack of
visible resistance to Israeli occupation from the Palestinian side,
except for temporary flare-ups, and Israel's ability to continue
negotiations while continuing to build settlements in occupied
Palestinian Territory has created the false impression that the
"process" of achieving peace could substitute for peace itself.  Thus,
the difficult substantial issues at the core of the conflict,
including acceptance that Israel's occupation of Arab territory it
conquered in the 1967 Israeli-Arab War is illegal, have been
constantly deflected in order to maintain talks without requiring
Israel to face up to its obligations.
<p>
In fact, the United States advocacy of "constructive ambiguity" has
had disastrous consequences for the peace process.  Both parties to
the conflict have mistakenly assumed at different times that either
the Israelis had accepted to end the occupation or that the
Palestinians had agreed to forego some of their fundamental rights as
a result of vaguely worded agreements.  Whereas such ambiguity made it
possible for both sides to sign agreements that they could interpret
in diametrically opposed manners to their domestic constituencies, the
facts on the ground of implementing opposing interpretations have led
to very little implementation at all.
<p>
This lack of implementation, combined with the ever-increasing number
of Palestinian-Israeli agreements brokered by the United States, has
caused Palestinians to become increasingly wary of US involvement in a
process that has brought some normalcy to Israel but none to
Palestinians.  The resulting lack of faith in the peace process and
the consequent distrust of US promotion of process over substance has
made securing a just peace all that more difficult.
<p>
NORMALIZATION BEFORE AN END TO THE OCCUPATION OF ARAB LANDS
<p>
US policy over the last seven years appears predicated on the need to
help Israel normalize its relations with the Arab and Muslim world at
large, as well as with many other nations around the world sympathetic
to the plight of Palestinians dispossessed by Israeli conquest.  The
peace process was used as an excuse to encourage states that had
foregone normal relations with Israel to begin the process of
normalization, with the argument that peace was just around the
corner.
<p>
Had the United States promoted the implementation of already signed
agreements between Israelis and Palestinians with the same zeal with
which it promoted new Israeli arrangements with Arab and other states,
it may have succeeded in actually promoting normalization.
<p>
Unfortunately, the US emphasis on process over substance has led the
domestic constituencies of many governments in the region to conclude
that the peace process was only a mirage designed to trick their
governments into prematurely establishing economic ties that would
help Israel break out of its regional isolation.  This has had the
added repercussion of promoting not only anti-Israeli sentiment in
countries that have established economic ties with Israel, but has
also promoted anti-American sentiment in all countries of the region,
as demonstrated by the grass-roots popular boycott of American
products in many states.
<p>
US negotiators in recent years never appeared to recognize that
normalcy was a state that existed between two free and equal peoples.
 As long as the occupation of Arab lands, including the Palestinian
Territories, continues, there can never be true normalization between
Israel and its neighbors.
<p>
ADOPTION OF ISRAELI PERSPECTIVE v. ACTING AS AN HONEST BROKER
<p>
The two bases for US involvement in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process have been 1) the physical fact that the United States is the
primary power in the Middle East and 2) that the United States has
promoted itself to the parties in the region as an honest broker
wishing to promote Israel's security as well as Palestinian national
aspirations.
<p>
Unfortunately, over the last seven years in particular, the US has
become increasingly identified with Israeli ideological assumptions.
Dennis Ross, for example, and some other members of his negotiating
team, have acknowledged having an emotional commitment to Israel and
have said they cannot distinguish between their personal and
professional involvement with it.  This has had a number of legal
ramifications that have affected the peace process negatively:
<p>
1. The United States began the peace process based on the goal of
implementing UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.  These
Resolutions, as repeatedly interpreted by the international community,
simply mean that Israel must withdraw from the Arab territories it
occupied in 1967 if it wants to have peaceful relations with its
neighbors.  After seven years of negotiations, the US negotiating team
now effectively advocates the position that the West Bank and Gaza are
Israeli territories, or at best disputed territories, for which the
Palestinians must bargain.  Settlements, for example, opposed by
Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Bush, have been tacitly endorsed by
recent US policy in the region.
<p>
2. Palestinian concessions to Israel have been made up front, as
demanded by Israel and the United States, for talks to take place
between the two sides.  However, those concessions were always viewed
by Israel as the starting point for negotiating further concessions.
This view appears to have been adopted by the United States of late.
US negotiators have implicitly blamed the Palestinians for not making
the same extent of "concessions" that Israel was offering.  Thus,
whereas Palestinians gave up their rights to all but 22% of historic
Palestine as early as 1988, they are chastised by the US negotiators
for wanting all of the Occupied Territories whereas Israelis have been
lauded for offering to dismantle only 20% of illegal settlements.
Israel's desire to continue occupying significant areas of Palestinian
territory is seen as a reasonable need by the US negotiating position
- morally and legally equating the illegal settlement of Palestinian
territory with the Palestinian right to reclaim that same territory.
<p>
3. US negotiators have accepted the Israeli world-view concerning the
primacy of Israel's security needs while ignoring the long-term
development of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the
improvement of the Palestinian quality of life. The result has been
that while Israel's security, including the security of its occupation
forces, have been the focus of each agreement, the quality of life of
Palestinians has continued to decline.  The dichotomy between the
comfort of Israelis, including those occupying Palestinian land in
settlements with green lawns and swimming pools, and the poverty and
misery of Palestinians, has only further inflamed an already volatile
situation.
<p>
Public support for one side over the other can also have negative
unintended consequences.  US negotiators' public criticism of the
Palestinian side at last summer's Camp David talks were intended to
provide domestic political support for the Israeli prime minister.
Instead, it allowed right wing extremists in Israel opposed to peace
all together to challenge the Israeli prime minister for having
offered "too many" concessions.  US inability to see past Israel's own
narrow perceptions of the conflict have further delayed concluding a
just and lasting peace.
<p>
US/ISRAELI DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONCERNS OVERRODE THE GOAL OF A LASTING
PEACE
<p>
Palestinians obviously have every interest in concluding a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace with Israelis as soon as
possible.  The original Oslo Accords had mandated that the peace talks
be concluded three years ago with a Palestinian state and an Israeli
state living in freedom, security, and equality side by side.
 Yet, as Israel attempted to colonize as much of the West Bank and
Gaza as possible before beginning final status talks, the Palestinians
were compelled to focus on Interim issues in negotiations, rather than
addressing the key permanent status issues.
<p>
Once mandated by domestic political considerations in Israel and the
United States, Palestinians have been placed under tremendous, and
sometimes unconscionable, pressure to sign weak and vague agreements
that could be used by political leaders to show progress to their
constituencies.  Rather than place a matter of such great existential
importance to both Palestinians and Israelis above the fray of
domestic politics, the timetable for reaching agreements has been
based on immediate domestic concerns even when the necessary
background work on substantive issues has not been done.
<p>
A comprehensive peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis must
not only be considered a valuable photo opportunity, but a matter of
great strategic importance for all the states of the region as well as
for those states that believe they have interests in the Middle East.
It has been obvious, especially over the course of the last year, that
the importance of a just and lasting peace has been overshadowed by
the need for yet another temporary or interim agreement that would
provide only short-term political gain to some of those involved - at
the risk of creating tremendous problems for the long-term stability
of the area.
<p>
CONCLUSION
<p>
US policy has not been static over the last decades.  It was the
United States that helped force Israeli, British, and French
occupation troops from Egypt in 1956.  President Jimmy Carter has
strongly advocated Palestinian rights, even during the Camp David
talks between Egypt and Israel, and repeatedly emphasized the
illegality of Israel's settlement policy.  President George Bush used
the position of the United States as a global leader to force Israel
to sit with Palestinians in negotiations for the first time and also
expended tremendous political capital to keep US aid to Israel from
being used to promote settlement building.  There is much the United
States can contribute to encouraging justice, peace, and stability in
the Middle East, but only if it can learn from the mistakes and
failures of the last seven years.  There remains much at stake, and
for every day that the Israeli occupation continues and settlements
continue to expand, peace becomes that much harder to achieve.
