<p><b>ISRAELIS SHELL PALESTINIAN NEIGHBORHOODS 
<br>'I want to send this missile back to Clinton' 
</b></p>




<p>

<p>[The following is the third report from a four-person delegation from 
the International Action Center from their humanitarian and 
fact-finding mission to Palestine during what is being called the Al 
Aqsa Intifada, or uprising. The delegation aims to bring back a 
first-hand report documenting the repression inflicted by the Israeli 
army and to bring medical supplies for Palestinian hospitals, which 
have been declared a state of medical emergency. The Emergency is 
caused by the dual problem of the heavy casualties inflicted by the 
Israeli repression and the inability of sick and wounded people to 
pass through Israeli checkpoints on their way to the hospital. The IAC 
delegation includes Richard Becker, Sara Flounders, Randa Jamal and 
Preston Wood.] 
<p>
************************** 

<p>Shelling from Israeli tanks and helicopter gun ships into Palestinian 
towns escalated Oct. 30 as the death toll from the repression rose to 
151 Palestinians by official count, plus eight Israelis. Scores of 
Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank were wounded. 

<p>Near midnight an announcement came over the television that everyone 
in the entire Palestinian nations was to go to the center of the town 
they lived in to demonstrate against the shelling by the Israeli army. 
It was a call for a massive national demonstration, taking place past 
midnight. 

<p>The four-person International Action Center delegation was in 
Ramallah, where they hoped to make their second delivery of 
medicines and dressings to the hospital the next morning. In the 
meantime Ramallah joined the list of towns targeted by the Israeli 
army. 

<p>From the rooftop near the family's home where they was staying, IAC 
delegation members could see and hear the step up in shelling from 
tanks. This is how IAC Western Regional Coordinator Richard Becker 
described it: 

<p>"At about 10:30 local time we saw a rocket attack from what we believe 
was an Apache helicopter some distance from the house that we're 
staying in. A plane that was flying over, we could see that, we saw a 
flare and then a large explosion took place possibly within a mile, 
mile and a half. 

<p>"We went immediately to the site and it turned out that a very small 
building from the Fatah organization had been rocketed in a 
residential neighborhood in Ramallah's twin city, El-Bireh. 

<p>"When we arrived on the scene there were many people on the streets. 
There's no other commercial or offices in this neighborhood, all the 
rest of the neighborhood was residential. The rocket hit the Fatah 
office, which is something like I would say six feet by 12 feet, a 
really a tiny office. 

<p>"Then we went immediately across the street to see the widespread 
damage to the residential apartments. We went inside to talk with the 
people inside the apartments, which all had the glass blown off in the 
front of buildings. There were pieces of the rocket inside the 
apartment, on the floor. 

<p>"By very great fortune none of the people were injured. We interviewed 
a 7-year-old boy who was very scared and a 13 year old and a 16-year- 
old girl who were terrified. Fortunately, their mother, a U.S. citizen 
who lives most of the time in Birmingham, Alabama, had heard the 
planes and the helicopters outside the house had brought the children 
into the center of the house in the hallway and had them on a 
mattress.

<h3>Al Haq </h3>
<p><b>Al-Haq calls for the Prosecution of Perpetrators of Extra- Judicial Killing of
Fourteen Year-Old Ala’a Mohammad Mahfouz
</b></p>



<p>Based upon an investigation conducted by al-Haq into the shooting
death of 14 year- old Ala’a Mohammad Mahfouz from al-Arroub Refugee Camp, north of
Hebron, al-Haq concludes that:

<p> 1. The Israeli soldier’s life was not in danger when
he shot Ala’a. The soldier in question was not acting in accordance with "IDF"
Regulations. <p> 2. The Israeli soldier was acting with the deliberate intent to kill,
constituting an extra-judicial killing.


<p>Al-Haq gathered the following
information from eyewitness testimonies surrounding the shooting death of Ala’a
Mohammad Mahfouz. Below is a summary of the testimonies: On October 6,
2000 there were confrontations in Al-Arroub camp between Palestinian protestors
and the Israeli Occupying Forces. Tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition
were being used by the Israeli Forces. Ala’a was throwing stones from his rooftop
when he hit an Israeli soldier, lightly wounding him. Another Israeli soldier
witnessed the incident. Ala’a’s father was afraid the soldier would take revenge on
Ala’a so he ordered him into the house. Fifteen metres away from the house of
Ala’a, an Israeli soldier stood waiting. The clashes continued for several
hours. Later, Ala’a went out on his porch with a cup of tea and was shot in the
head by an Israeli soldier standing 10 metres away (by the short distance in which
the shot was fired, it was clear that the soldier knew his target). Ala’a’s father was
standing nearby when the shooting took place and quickly took Ala’a to Ahli
Hospital. Ala’a was unconscious and bleeding badly.  At around 7 pm that
same day, an Israeli soldier stopped a young man Nasser Al-Badawi and spoke to
him in Hebrew, as Nasser speaks Hebrew well. The soldier asked Nasser where he
was going and Nasser replied that his friend was seriously injured and Nasser was
now returning from the hospital. The Israeli soldier replied that he was the one
who shot Ala’a because he was throwing stones. The soldier was certain that Ala’a
would die from the injury. Nasser gave a full description of the Israeli soldier and
this soldier has been seen many times shooting in al-Arroub Camp.Ala’a
remained in the Ahli hospital for 4 days and was transferred to Saudi Arabia
where he died on October 26, 2000. This shooting would indicate that Israeli
soldiers are not acting according to their military regulations.<p> Regulations for the
Israeli Occupying Forces (IDF) state that the soldier will use a weapon in the event
of immediate “danger to life” and should not open fire towards women and children.
The eyewitness testimonies of this incident clearly indicate that the Israeli soldier
responsible for the death of Ala’a was not following (IDF) regulations.
Aside from not following their own standards, the "IDF" is also acting in complete
disregard of international humanitarian law and international human rights principles.
<p>Al-Haq has fully documented this and similar incidents and reiterates that willful
killing constitutes a grave breach of Article 146 and 147 of the Fourth Geneva
Convention.Article 146 imposes an obligation on the States Parties to the
Convention, especially those who have incorporated it into their domestic legislation,
to search for and prosecute in their domestic courts those who commit grave
breaches or order them to be committed.<p> Al-Haq is willing to make available all of its
documentation related to this matter to those Parties of the Convention who wish to
fulfill their obligations in domestic and conventional law. <p> Al-Haq calls upon
the international community to form an investigative committee to study the
circumstances of the death of Ala’a and other Palestinians who have been the
victims of extra- judicial killings perpetrated by the Israeli Occupying Forces and
Israeli settlers the 157 Palestinians that have been killed by the Israeli Occupying
Forces since the beginning of the clashes.Al-Haq reiterates its call to the
international community to form a war crimes tribunal and begin to prosecute those
responsible for grave breaches.

<h3> <a name="sahour"></a> </h3>
<h3>Emergency Committee of Beit Sahour,</h3>
<p><b>"Shepherds' Emergency Refugee Camp - 2000"
</b></p>




<p>An emergency camp has been set up in Beit Sahour in order to
provide
shelter for families whose homes have been destroyed or damaged
by the
Israeli occupation forces since the beginning of Al-Aqsa Intifada.
The present situation for these families in Beit Sahour is yet one
more traumatic event in the history of the Palestinian people since
the catastrophe of 1948.   In 1948, over one million Palestinians
were
made refugees who were dispersed into various camps in West
Bank,
Gaza, and abroad.   Again, and as a result of the 1967 war, an
additional half million Palestinians were made refugees.  Today,
after
more than half a century since the catastrophe, Israel continues its
occupation and terror over Palestinian cities, villages, and camps
throughout the West Bank and Gaza.

<p>In order to confront this aggression, the Palestinian resistance
movement has been active in all areas and countries where Palestinians
are living. The Intifada of Al-Aqsa, which began over one month ago,
has brought together Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, Galilee, and
the Triangle, and reveals the cruel reality of the Israeli occupation
and its crimes. Al-Aqsa Intifada is an affirmation of Palestinian
national rights: the right of refugees to return, the right to
self-determination, the right to establish a sovereign Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.

<p>Admittedly, freedom and independence for the Palestinian people come
at a high price.  Since the beginning of Al-Aqsa Intifada, the
occupation forces have continuously stepped up their assaults on the
people of Beit Sahour, using combat helicopters, rockets, heavy
machine guns, and banned ammunition.   To date, eight homes have been
completely destroyed, over 100 homes have been damaged in various
ways, and over 130 families have been displaced.  Those who have not
been able to stay with relatives or friends now live in this emergency
camp.

<p>The policy of Israel in destroying homes, confiscating land, and
uprooting trees is well-known and has been experienced by thousands of
families since the emergence of Israel.   The process of displacement
causes not only financial hardship, but more importantly, serves to
destroy the social, familial, and psychological well-being of
Palestinians, especially children.

<p>These facts serve to remind the international community in general,
and the United Nations' Security Council and General Assembly in
particular, that they have a direct responsibility to act immediately
to put an end to Israeli terror against our people and to provide
Palestinians with international protection as a step toward ending the
occupation.

<p>In addition to providing shelter for homeless families, the goals of
this emergency refugee camp are the following: a. To facilitate
lobbying and advocacy on behalf of the traumatized people of Beit
Sahour b. To strengthen the ties of solidarity among the people of
Beit Sahour c. To enhance the solidarity movement with our displaced
brothers and sisters throughout our cities, villages, and camps d. to
reaffirm the core of our cause, namely that there are four million
Palestinian refugees who, after 52 years, are still fighting for and
waiting for their right to return to their homes and homeland

<p>The resistance will continue until our aims are reached.  Let us work
together so that depression does not conquer our minds and the minds
of our children and families.  There is no alternative to freedom and
independence, no matter how vicious the reaction of the occupation.

<p><b>ONE DEAD, 276 INJURED
2 LAW FIELD RESEARCHERS INJURED IN RAMALLAH
</b></p>


<p>For the 36th consecutive day, Israeli forces responded with lethal
force against Palestinian demonstrators throughout the West Bank
and
Gaza, killing one and injuring 276, including 2 LAW field
researchers.

<p>This afternoon, Nahid Fate Ahmad Alloh, 21, from Gaza, but living in
Tulkarem Refugee camp, died after being hit by live ammunition
during
clashes west of Tulkarem. The bullet entered the right side of his
body and exited on the left side.

<p>In the village of Sailat Athaher, near Nablus, Assad Abulrahman
Hantouli was shot in the face with live ammunition. He is in serious
condition at the Jenin hospital.

<p>In Hizma village, outside Jerusalem, 30 Palestinians were injured
during clashes with Israeli soldiers and settlers. Three were hit with
live ammunition, and 27 were hit with rubber-coated metal bullets.

<p>In northern Ramallah, by the City Inn, 158 were injured, 10 by
rubber-coated metal bullets and the rest by tear gas. Two LAW field
researchers, Hosam Rajab, 27, and Thuraya El Ayan, 43, were injured
while monitoring the demonstration after Friday prayers in Ramallah.
Hosam was shot with a rubber-coated metal bullet in his neck.  He was
standing 150 meters from the Israeli soldiers.  Thuraya was hit with a
rubber-coated metal bullet in her left thigh.  They were taken to Al
Mustakbal Hospital in Ramallah.

<p>In Hebron 28 were injured, 2 by live ammunition.

<p>In Bethlehem, 15 were injured by rubber-coated metal bullets; 1 was
hit in the head.

<p>In Jenin: near Al Jalame checkpoint, 20 were injured, 7 by
rubber-coated metal bullets and 13 by tear gas. In Yab'ad (near
Jenin), 9 were injured by tear gas.  Israeli occupation forces are
currently attempting to enter Yab'ad.  Also, Israeli tanks have
surrounded the village of al-Jalameh, near Jenin.

<p>In Gaza, 6 were injured by rubber-coated metal bullets.  In Khan
Younis, a cameraman for Palestinian TV was injured. In Rafah, Israeli
forces demolished 2 houses and injured 1 Palestinian at the Salah-Adin
gate.  At the Netzarim Junction, 1 was injured. At the Bourij Refugee
Camp, 2 were injured. Kufar Darom, 1 was injured. At Karni, four were
injured, one in the neck.

<p>Israeli forces denied anyone under the age of 45 to enter the Haram Al
Sharif in Jerusalem for Friday prayers.

<p>Today Israeli forces re-deployed to their positions surrounding a
number of towns and villages in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<p><b>THREE MORE CHILDREN DIE IN THE AL-AQSA INTIFADA
</b></p>




<p>


Today, Monday 6 November, in continuing clashes in the Occupied
Palestinian Territories, two Palestinian youths under the age of 18
were killed by the Israeli security forces, apparently by live
ammunition. Wadje Alam Khattab (15) was shot in the chest and
killed
near the West Bank town of Tulkarem. Mohammed Nawal al Taban
(17),
from Deir Al-Bala refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, was shot dead
near
the settlement of Kfar Darom.

<p>A third youth, Muhammad Mustafa al Jazir (17), from Rafah in the
Gaza
Strip, who was shot in the head on 28 October at Salah-a-Din Gate,
died today in Morocco from his injuries. Al Jazir had been transferred
to Morroco for medical treatment.

<p>According to LAW's database, 157 Palestinians have been killed since
the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada on 29 September 2000 and over
7000 have been injured; 45 among those killed have been children under
the age of 18. In practically all cases children did not pose a
life-threatening danger to Israeli soldiers who shot them.

<p>Most of the injuries sustained by Palestinian demonstrators were in
the upper parts of the body. This raises the suspicion that the
Israeli security forces are pursuing a shoot to kill policy. Wadje
Alam Khattab and Muhammad al Jazir died from shots to the chest and to
the head respectively.

<p>Israel has been accused of using excessive and indiscriminate force by
the United Nations Security Council in resolution 1322 of 7 October,
as well as by a number of international human rights organizations
such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Physicians for
Human Rights.

<p>With specific regard to children under the age of 18, the
indiscriminate and excessive use of force by the Israeli security
forces in the ongoing clashes constitutes violations of both
international human rights and humanitarian law. In its Special
Session the UN Commission on Human Rights established that Israeli
actions constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity and called
upon Israel to put an immediate end to the use of force against
unarmed civilians.

<p>LAW urges the Israeli government to abide by the stipulations of
international humanitarian law and the UN Code of Conduct for Law
Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.

<p>LAW also calls on the Israeli government to implement UN resolutions
242, 338 and 194.

<h3>BADIL</h3>
<p><b>INTERNATONAL PROTECTION - 
Overview and Special Protection for Refugees 
</b></p>

 

<br> <br> 
International law, the system of law that governs actions by states, 
defines the basic rights accorded to all persons. These rights stem 
from at least three bodies of international law: HUMAN RIGHTS LAW law 
(1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the two international 
covenants, commonly referred to as the 1966 "International Bill of 
Rights", a.o); HUMANITARIAN LAW which governs the actions of state in 
time of war and/or military occupation (1907 Hague Regulations, 1949 
Geneva Conventions and the additional 1977 Protocols thereto, a.o.); 
and, as a sub-set of human rights law, the LAW CONCERNING REFUGEES AND 
STATELESS PERSONS (1950 Statute of the UNHCR, 1951 Convention Relating 
to the Status of Refugees and companion 1967 Protocol, the 1954 and 
1961 Statelessness Conventions, a.o.). 
<br> <br> 
Protection of the basic rights of individuals as delineated by these 
three inter-related bodies of law is a primary responsibility of the 
United Nations and its individual member states. This mandate emanates 
from the 1945 Charter of the United Nations, Article 1(1), which 
establishes the purpose of the UN as being: "to maintain international 
peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective 
measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and 
for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the 
peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with 
the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or 
settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to 
a breach of the peace." 
<br> <br> 
The United Nations system provides for a wide variety of mechanisms 
for the implementation of international law and protection of the 
rights defined therein. These mechanisms include at least the 
following: 
<br> <br> 
(1) GATHERING and RECEIVING INFORMATION/COMPLAINTS on the compliance 
of individual state parties to the various conventions administered 
under UN auspices through UN organs such as the UN Commission on Human 
Rights (e.g., INTERNATIONAL INQUIRIES, special rapporteurs) and other 
treaty bodies (e.g., the Committees on Civil and Political Rights; 
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights; Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, a.o.); the Office of the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR); and the UN General Assembly and Security 
Council. Individuals and non-governmental/private organizations can 
play an important role in providing information to the various UN 
organs, creating international awareness, and calling for redress 
where rights have or are being violated. Reports submitted to the 
various UN organs over the past several years have raised the profile 
of Palestinian rights and have resulted in more thorough probing of 
Israel's non-compliance with treaties to which it is a signatory. 
<br> <br> 
(2) CALLING UPON STATES TO COMPLY with international law and 
facilitating agreements to effectuate the rights defined and affirmed 
therein through the various UN organs mentioned above (1). This is 
most often implemented through resolutions and, in the case of the 
UNHCR, tripartite agreements with the state of origin and state of 
asylum to expedite the voluntary return of refugees to their homes. 
Repeated affirmation of Palestinian rights by a wide variety of UN 
organs, including the Security Council, General Assembly, Economic and 
Social Council, and Commission on Human Rights are grounded in 
customary norms of international law, which are, accordingly, binding 
upon all states, including Israel. 
<br> <br> 
(3) ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES, where rights are being violated, 
through bodies such as the INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE(ICJ), which 
exercises jurisdiction over disputes between states according to the 
terms of the UN Charter and the Statute of the ICJ. For example, in an 
ICJ advisory opinion of 1971, requested by the UN Security Council, 
the ICJ found South Africa's military occupation of Namibia to be 
illegal and held that member states of the UN were under an obligation 
to refrain from any acts and, in particular, dealings with South 
Africa that implied recognition of the legality of the occupation or 
provided support and assistance to it. A second type of protection, 
less immediate though it may act as a type of restraining mechanism, 
are the WAR CRIMES TRIBUNALS for prosecution of violations of 
international law, as established by Security Council resolutions in 
the recent cases of the former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda, as well as the 
permanent international criminal law regime which is contemplated 
under the 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court 
(ICC). The UN Commission on Human Rights has considered Israel's 
continued "grave breaches" of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention as 
rising to the level of war crimes since 1972 and recently reaffirmed 
this view during a Special Session of the Commission in October of 
this year. 
<br> <br> 
(4) INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION when violations persist. Member states 
acting alone, or in concert under regional or security umbrellas such 
as the OAU, NATO, and the OSCE, etc. may choose to enact a variety of 
political, legal, or economic sanctions against offending parties. 
Protection against "threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and 
acts of aggression" may be activated by the UN Security Council under 
Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This includes both SANCTIONS as well as 
armed INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FORCES. The UN Commission on Human 
Rights has previously called for the Security Council to endorse 
Chapter VII intervention in the 1967 occupied territories to protect 
Palestinians against Israel's "grave breaches" of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. All High Contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention are obligated by the express terms of the Convention itself 
to ensure compliance of state parties to the Convention, particularly 
with respect to grave breaches. 
<br> <br> 
RELEVANCE FOR THE PALESTINIAN CASE 
<br> <br> 
Each of these bodies of international law - human rights law, 
humanitarian law, and refugee law - are relevant to international 
protection in the Palestinian case. Despite a large body of 
information that documents gross, systematic, and persistent 
violations under all three bodies of law, as well as declaratory 
resolutions calling upon Israel for compliance, including GA 
Resolution 194, SC Resolution 242 and recommendations for Chapter VII 
intervention, the United Nations and its member states have failed to 
effectuate international protection for the Palestinian people. This 
is so mainly, as noted by the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1992, 
because of the "military, economic, and political support given by 
some States [e.g. the US and some European allies] to Israel, which 
encourages and supports Israel in its aggressive and expansionist 
policies." The failure to effectuate international protection of the 
rights embodied in international law for the Palestinian people 
represents a serious violation of the purposes and principles of the 
UN as defined in its Charter, and at base, is the cause of the 
collapse of the Oslo process, the Palestinian uprising, and the high 
number of Palestinian deaths (martyrs) (more than 160, of whom some 
1/3 are children), injuries (more than 5,000), and property damage 
inflicted by Israel over the past month as confirmed in an increasing 
number of reports by international human rights organizations such as 
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Physicians for Human 
Rights. 

<br> <br> INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIAN REFUGEES 
<br> <br> 
This violation by the United Nations and its member states of 
fundamental obligations under the UN Charter is particularly glaring 
in the case of Palestinian refugees who should be provided in 
accordance with international refugee law. ** Refugees, in general, 
are recognized as vulnerable persons in need of specific types of 
international protection to guarantee those rights normally protected 
by the state of residence or citizenship ** There are two levels of 
international refugee protection: (a) the protection of refugees' 
human rights on a day-to-day basis (including physical safety, freedom 
of movement [identity papers and travel documents], access to 
employment, basic housing, welfare, education, labor and security 
rights, and freedom of religion); and, (b) the search for and 
implementation of durable solutions for refugees based on individual 
choice (including the right of return and restitution/compensation, or 
resettlement). 
<br> <br> 
Most refugees receive international protection, as defined by the 1951 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, from the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Under the 
Statute of the UNHCR, some protection duties include: (a) promoting 
ratification and implementation of conventions for the protection of 
refugees; (b) assisting governmental and private efforts to promote 
durable solutions, including voluntary repatriation; and (c) seeking 
to obtain permission for refugees to safeguard, manage, and access 
their assets. 
<br> <br> 
** in the case of Palestinian refugees, there is no international body 
at present that provides full protection ** The UN Relief and Works 
Agency (UNRWA) has, on an ad hoc basis, as during the first intifada, 
assumed limited day-to-day protection functions by monitoring and 
reporting violations, and making interventions to Israel. The UN 
Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP), the body established by 
the UN under Resolution 194 to provide protection for Palestinian 
refugees ceased to work for the implementation of both levels of 
protection in the early 1950s. No other international body has stepped 
in to fill the vacuum left by the cessation of UNCCP protection, 
despite provisions in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of 
Refugees for the activation of the UNCHR, which should apply in this 
context. 

<br> <br> The impact of this vacuum on a day-to-day basis is evident after a 
month of Palestinian uprising and Israeli repression in the occupied 
Palestinian territories. Palestinian refugee camps have been hit by 
Israeli helicopter gun-ships and tanks, surrounded and shot at by both 
the Israeli military and Israeli settlers. Freedom of movement to 
reach places of employment, education, and medical care has been 
denied. A significant number of Palestinians killed and injured, 
including a large number of children, are refugees. To whom do 
Palestinian refugees turn for protection? Moreover, what international 
body is responsible for the protection, promotion, and facilitation of 
the right of Palestinian refugees to repatriation, restitution and 
compensation according to Resolution 194 and the larger body of 
international law? 

<br> <br> RECOMMENDATIONS 
<br> <br> 
Based on resolutions of the UN General Assembly and Security Council, 
and the Special Summit of the Arab League (Cairo, 21-22 October 2000), 
the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations and Arab states have 
launched two initiatives which require approval by the UN Security 
Council: the deployment of an international protection force for the 
Palestinian people in the 1967 occupied territories; and, the 
establishment of a special war crimes tribunal for prosecution of 
Israeli violations of humanitarian law. In addition, Palestinian NGOs 
have appealed to the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention to take measures, which can ensure Israel's compliance to 
the regulations of the Convention. 
<br> <br> 
While these initiatives could effectuate immediate protection for the 
Palestinian people in the 1967 occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
their approval remains in doubt as long as the United States and some 
European states maintain their unconditional support for Israel, 
support which violates their own obligations under the UN Charter and 
the three bodies of international law. A concerted and sustained 
effort by the PLO, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab League and Arab 
states, and governments supportive of Palestinian rights is required 
in order to: change the current unfavorable balance of forces in the 
powerful international organs, ensure that any international UN 
protection force is fully empowered to intervene to provide protection 
(unlike the Temporary International Presence in Hebron - TIPH, which 
is mandated only to monitor and report violations); and guarantee that 
any future negotiations are consistent with international law and 
relevant UN resolutions. 


<br> <br> PALESTINAN, ARAB, and INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS and 
the SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT CAN ENCOURAGE AND FAICILITATE SUCH CONCERNTED 
EFFORT BY: 
<br> <br> 
1. CONDUCTING BROAD PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS 
about Palestinian rights anchored in international law and UN 
resolutions (especially UN resolutions 181, 194, and 242) as well as 
Israeli violations of these international standards. An initial set of 
recommended references is attached below. [The full text documents are 
available on the BADIL website: 
www.badil.org/Refugee/Protection/overview.html] 
<br> <br> 
2. ENGAGING in a SUSTAINED EFFORT of REPORTING OF ISRAELI HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS to the UN Commission of Human Rights (CHR) and other 
treaty bodies, accompanied by extensive media dissemination of reports 
and resolutions issued by these UN organs. Of particular relevance are 
resolutions of the CHR, the 1998 Concluding Observations of the 
various UN human rights treaty bodies, and recent reports of the CHR 
Special Rapporteur. [Documents are available on the BADIL website] 
Media strategies should be considered to maintain maximum public 
visibility on the upcoming UN Commission on Human Rights international 
inquiry commission to the occupied territories. 
<br> <br> 
3. EMPOWERING THE PALESTINIAN COMMUNITY in Palestine and in exile to 
mobilize, advocate and lobby on behalf of their rights. Recent 
successful efforts by refugee students in Lebanon to lobby for UNRWA 
secondary schooling, combined with support from Palestinian, Arab, and 
international non-governmental organizations, is one example of a 
successful strategy for empowering the Palestinian refugee community. 

<br> <br> 4. LOBBYING GOVERNMENTS, POLICY MAKERS, and their POLICY ADVISORS to 
take a clear stand in favor of Palestinian rights, as defined by 
international law and UN resolutions. Individuals and organizations 
should examine the voting record in the UN and policy statements of 
their governments and question votes and statements that are not 
consistent with those rights defined by international law. [An initial 
review of the US voting record in the UN Commission on Human Rights is 
available on the BADIL website with further analysis of other states 
forthcoming] 

<br> <br> 5. LAUNCHING a SPECIAL LOBBY EFFORT AIMED AT MAKING UN ORGANS and 
MECHANISMS ACCESSIBLE to ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE SECTORS of the 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE (refugees, internally displaced persons, and the 
Palestinian community in occupied eastern Jerusalem and inside Israel) 
who have remained excluded from the international protection system. 
Lobby efforts regarding the need for an international protection 
agency for Palestinian refugees should be addressed in particular to 
UNRWA, UNHCR, and the ICRC, calling for immediate joint consultations 
in the UN and with other relevant international agencies towards 
implementation of refugee protection. 

<br> <br> 6. ENCOURAGE EXPERTS to PROVIDE RESEARCH AND LEGAL EXPERTISE 
in order to support governmental and non-governmental efforts in 
professional lobbying of UN organs and the submission of legal 
petitions (e.g., ICJ; regional and domestic courts, and special war 
crimes tribunal). [An initial list of research topics is available on 
the BADIL website]
