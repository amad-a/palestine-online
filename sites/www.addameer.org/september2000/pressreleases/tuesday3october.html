<b>  CDFJ is gravely concerned over Israeli violence against Palestinian journalists </b> 

 

<p>For Immediate Release

CDFJ is gravely concerned over Israeli violence against Palestinian 

journalists



<p>Amman The Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) has said in a 

statement released today, October 3, that its gravely concerned over the 

extended violence against Palestinian journalists during clashes and 

demonstrations that erupted in Palestinian territories over the past four days.



<p>The Center has said that Israeli violations against Palestinian journalists 

reflects the Israeli position which is in severe conflict with principles 

of democracy and respect for human rights, and violates treaties and 

international agreements which Israel is a signatory.



<p>According to various reports from media and independent sources, a number 

of journalists have been beaten up as well as being exposed to live fire 

from Israeli army forces while carrying out their duties covering clashes 

and violence throughout the West Bank and Gaza. Some of news coverage that 

<p>Palestinian journalists have done exposed inhuman and violent practices by 

the Israeli forces such as the deliberate shooting of the 12 years old 

Mohamed Abu Dura in his father's arms.



<p>Reports coming out from Palestinian territories have said that four 

Palestinian journalists have been severely beaten up and physically 

assaulted in the Aqsa Mosque in the first day of the Palestinian uprising. 

<p>Those were; Kahled Abu Aker who works for the French second channel, the 

same channel that broadcasted footage of young Abu Dura, Awad Awad who 

works for Agence France Press, Mahfouz Abu Turk and journalist Khaled 

Zighari who has been reported to be taken to hospital after he was shoot by 

live ammunition.



<p>In the third day, both Amer Ga'abari and Mazin D'ana have been seriously 

injured and were taken to hospital. Ga'abari has been reported to been 

shoot by a bullet in the head. There have been no reports about the nature 

and conditions of journalists Wa'el Shiokhi and Wafeek Matar who have been 

also injured during the clashes.



<p>CDFJ notes that the extension of violence against Palestinian journalists 

by Israeli arm forces has become a critical phenomenon that should be 

stopped. In September 1996, and during the clashes over the opening of the 

tunnel under the Aqsa Mosque, the same kind of violence against Palestinian 

journalists carrying out their work has been significantly reported.



<p>The Center has also stated that repeated incidents where Palestinian 

journalists have been targeted and assaulted in hot conflict zones, as what 

has been substantially reported in September 1996 and September of this 

year, should draw the attention of international and governmental 

institutions and bodies to

the need to provide protection measures for Palestinian journalists 

carrying out their duties in the West Bank and Gaza while forcing the 

Israeli government to respect and comply with any set of international 

conditions that points out to that.



<p>CDFJ has called on all human rights organizations throughout the world to 

condemn Israeli forces practices against Palestinian people and called for 

a large campaign in solidarity with Palestinian journalists. The Center has 

also asked international media to focus on exposing the current situation 

in Palestinian.



<p>The Center for Defending Freedom of Journalist is a not-for-profit NGO that 

aims at defending and protecting journalists' freedom and rights. The 

Center is based in Amman, Jordan. <p align=right><A HREF="#top">back to top</A></p>

<B>Over a Million British Muslims call for an end to "barbaric" Israeli actions  </B>

 

<p>PRESS RELEASE



<p>3rd October 2000



<p>Over a Million British Muslims call for an end to "barbaric" Israeli actions

 



<p>Over 300 Muslim organisations around Britain, representing over one million people, are rallying behind calls made by Friends of Al Aqsa, Muslim Council of Britain and Palestinian Return Centre, for the British government to take a lead role in bringing tranquillity over the latest violence in Occupied Palestine.



<p>The violence, which is a direct result of Ariel Sharon's, the perpetrator of massacres at Sabra and Chatila, hostile visit to one of the holiest site to Muslims, the Al Aqsa Haram Sharif.



<p>Past few days has seen carnage due to the barbaric approach of the Israeli Police upon the defenceless people of Palestine. The excessive and fatal use of force has already resulted in the death of over 40 people and over 500 injured with nearly 50 per cent of the deaths to children under the age of 18 and one as young as 18 months old baby.



<p>We the undersigned British Muslim who hold in reverence Jerusalem and the Al Aqsa Mosque, believe that Britain has a special role to play in seeking an end to the latest "carnage" and call upon the British Government to:



<p>To condemn Israel for the use of excessive force, aggressive policies and having started the conflict. 



<p>The formation of an international investigative committee to investigate the crimes being committed by the Israeli occupying authorities in the Palestinian territories and bring those responsible to trial. 



<p>To apply pressure on Israel to comply with all UN Resolutions including 242, 338 and to totally withdraw from the occupied territories including East Jerusalem. 



<p>The Israeli government should be isolated from the international community with political and economical sanction applied.

 

<p>We remind Britain and the EU that they do not recognise Israeli sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem and therefore should act to ensure the illegal Israeli occupation of Jerusalem is brought to an immediate end.

<B>Urgent: Help! </B>

<p>Over the past week, the Palestinian people have lived in a state of war. At a critical time in the final status negotiations in the peace process, the man behind the massacre of Sabra and Shatila, Ariel Sharon, visited the Haram El-Sahrif in Jerusalem under the protection of Israeli policemen and soldiers. The visit and the repeated Israeli official stance denying Palestinian rights in Jerusalem lead to intifada-like demonstrations by Palestinians throughout Palestine. 



<p>The Israeli Army responded with excessive force to these demonstrations. They used high-velocity bullets, live ammunition, anti-tank missiles, and helicopter gunships. In 6 days of clashes, 66 Palestinians were killed and over 1,600 injured. The confrontations are still taking place. One 12-year old, Mohammad El-Dura, was killed in cold blood, like many others. Israeli soldiers or settlers shot 25 children. One was less than two years old. 



<p>Since it establishment, Israel has been violating international law and human rights standards. Israeli atrocities have been documented by international organizations. The international community has repeatedly condemned Israel for these acts. Nonetheless, the crimes continue to be perpetrated against Palestinian civilians. 



<p>The core issue is that Israel cannot bring itself to believe that Palestinians are equal human beings. The suppressed guilt of the Israelis prevents them from facing themselves and the atrocities they have committed. One Israeli woman asked, "why do these children put themselves in the line of fire." She did not want to ask herself why soldiers are killing them. 



<p>As stated in international law and UN resolutions, Israel is an occupying force. They have no right to be on Palestinian soil. The Palestinians are guaranteed by international law the right to free themselves from this occupation and defend themselves against oppression. Yet, Israel has been the recipient of a great deal of international aid that has allowed it to build the army and security machines that have been oppressing Palestinians. 



<p>We call upon the international community to take a firm stand against the outrageous human rights violations perpetrated by the Israeli leadership and military establishment. We appeal to individuals and governments to: 

<ul>

<li>Stop the serious Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people. 

<li> Secure international protection to the Palestinian people from the Israeli army. 

<li>Mount pressure on the UN Security Council to take concrete measures to protect the Palestinian people. 

<li>Strongly condemn Israeli human rights violations. 

<li>Take measures to ensure Israeli implementation of UN resolutions on the Palestinian rights including the withdrawal from the occupied land, including Jerusalem, and the right of return. 

<li>Boycott Israel on all fronts, economic, political, and diplomatic, until it proves its willingness to implement UN resolutions. 

<li> We call upon the masses in the Arab and Muslim world and all advocates of peace and justice where ever they maybe to organize demonstrations supporting Palestinians rights, and pressure their governments to boycott Israel culturally, economically, politically, and militarily. 

<li>We call upon Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to declare the Palestinian State with Jerusalem it's capital. </ul>

<h2>Ittijah Calls for International Campaign to 

Protect Palestinian Citizens of Israel </h2>



<p>As the recent attacks by the State of Israel on its Palestinian 

citizens made clear, the Palestinian population of Israel is a 

population at risk and in dire need of outside assistance to protect 

its freedom and defend its rights. Ittijah - Union of Arab Community 

Based Associations therefore calls for an international campaign to 

safeguard the rights and existence of the Palestinian community in 

Israel. 



<p>This campaign is necessary as recent violence aimed at Palestinians 

on both sides of the Green Line has shown that in dealing with 

Palestinians, Israel makes no distinction between Palestinians in the 

West Bank and Gaza who live under Israeli occupation and the 

Palestinians in Israel who make up some 20% of country's

citizenry. 

Indeed, this sentiment was expressed explicitly by a high ranking 

Israeli police office who, commenting on the ongoing clashes between 

Palestinian youths and Israeli forces, asserted that "[The] Green 

Line doesn't exist anymore". Implied by this statement was

the fact 

that Israel feels free to oppress Palestinians on both sides of the 

Green Line in equal measure.



<p>As citizens of a state that refuses to accord them even a modicum of 

security or protection, Palestinians in Israel are in urgent need of 

international support. Ten Palestinian citizens of Israel have 

already been murdered by their government's forces in the past

four days: 3 in Umm El-Fahem, 2 in Arabeh, 2 in Sakhnin, 1 in 

Nazareth, 1 in Moaweye and 1 in Jatt. Dozens more were injured, and 

thousands endangered, as Israeli police attacked unarmed 

demonstrators in Palestinian towns throughout Israel.



<p>The scale of these attacks, and Israel's ongoing treatment of 

Palestinians as enemies and not citizens both indicate that this is 

not an internal Israeli matter but rather one that demands 

international intervention. 



<p>Ittijah therefore calls on all people of conscience to join the 

campaign to safeguard the rights of Palestinians in Israel. We urge 

you take the following action:

<ol>

<li>Call or write to your local government representative

demanding 

that they take all necessary steps to assure an end to Israeli 

massacres of Palestinians everywhere;

<li>Call or write to your national representatives (Presidents,

Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers) demanding both their 

immediate intervention to halt the bloodshed and their public 

condemnation of Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians;

<li>Call or write to Israeli Embassies in your home country

expressing your horror at the scale of Israeli attacks on Palestinian 

civilians and demanding an immediate end to the violence [for updated 

statistics on those injured and martyred in the continuing attacks go 

to www.addameer.org/september2000];

<li>Call or write to Prime Minister Ehud Barak and acting

Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami demanding they take immediate action 

to end the massacres and grant Palestinians everywhere their human 

and civil rights;

<li>Contact your local human rights organizations urging them

to follow Amnesty International's lead and investigate, and

report publicly on, Israeli attacks on civilians in Israel, the West 

Bank and Gaza, attacks which Amnesty has already condemned as

"excessive and indiscriminate use of force which is in

contravention of international human rights standards".</ol>

<b> 



UPDATE:

A Total of 13 Palestinian Children Martyred, Over 600 Injured</b> 



 <p>Clashes continued throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip today, with

intense confrontations in the city of Hebron, in the southern West 

Bank,

and the Gaza Strip. In Hebron today, confrontations reached their peak 

as

Israeli soldiers and settlers entered territories under the 

jurisdiction of

the Palestinian National Authority and began attacking Palestinian

civilians.  In the northern area of the West Bank, illegal Israeli 

settlers

have launched attacks against Palestinian villages.   



<p>Over 50 Palestinians have been killed since the outbreak of 

demonstrations

following Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to 

the

Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem on 28 September.  Of those, DCI/PS has

verified the deaths of at least 13 Palestinian children.  In addition, 

as

of 4:30pm today, over 630 children from the West Bank, including 

Jerusalem,

and the Gaza Strip have been injured in the ongoing clashes, with 12

children still in critical condition after having sustained serious

injuries.  According to a random sampling, approximately 40% of the 

total

wounded by the Israeli occupation forces are children.  It is important 

to

note, however, that precise statistics and information regarding 

children

killed and wounded is difficult to attain.  This is due to a number of

factors, including the unstable and chaotic situation on the ground and 

the

high number of casualties, particularly regarding the numbers of 

injured.  



<p>As the confrontations continue and grow more intense in some areas, 

DCI/PS

reiterates its call for the international community to act immediately 

to

put an end to the Israeli military forces' attack on Palestinian 

civilians.

 The ramifications of the recent violence will have lasting 

consequences,

both physical and psychological, on thousands of Palestinian children, 

both

those having experienced such violence first hand and those who 

witnessed

it.  Please fax letters to the following individuals requesting their

immediate intervention and the establishment of an international 

commission

of inquiry into the gross human rights violations of the Israeli 

military

forces in the past week:

          <b>The Israeli Occupation Forces continue their crimes<br>

                          A new victim in Gaza</b>



<p>

This morning, clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli

Occupation Forces resumed at the junction of Al-Shuhada' near Netzarim

Settlement.  PCHR's field officers just reported that the Israeli

Occupation Forces are now bombarding the area with missiles and bombs,

and that helicopters are being deployed again.



<p>The corpse of Fahmi Abu Ammouneh, 28 years old from Nuseirat, has just

been transported to Shefa' Hospital in Gaza city.  Abu Amouneh was shot

by a shell in the head at 11:00 am GMT.  Moreover, dozens of injured

Palestinian civilians were also evacuated to Shefa' Hospital and to a

clinic near the area of clashes.



<p>On 2 October, the Israeli Occupying Forces bombarded three houses in

Rafah. No injuries were reported among the families.  Those houses were

located at the border with Egypt, which is under the control of the

Israeli Occupation Forces. Furthermore, the same day, Israeli

helicopters dropped bombs which severely damaged two housing buildings

at Netzarim area, next to the Israeli military outpost.





<p>PCHR is deeply worried about the deteriorating situation in the 

occupied

Palestinian territory due to the excessive use of force by the Israeli

Occupation Forces.  PCHR reiterates its calls for an immediate

international intervention to halt the ongoing Israeli aggression.

<b>URGENT APPEAL UPDATE

'Cease-Fire' Misleading

Israeli Army Attacks Continue</b>



<p>October 3, 2000, 5:30 PM



<p>In six days of sustained Israeli attacks, 51 Palestinians have lost 

their

lives and over 1,600 have been injured.  Approximately 20% of the 

injured

are children.  



<p>News reports speak of a 'cease-fire', but this term is misleading.  A

cease-fire implies an agreement between two armed military forces.  In

reality, the Israeli army has attacked unarmed Palestinian civilians 

with

brutal force, using weapons designed for military assault.  Palestinian

men, women, and children are being killed and maimed by tanks, 

helicopters,

high-velocity exploding bullets and anti-tank missiles.  Supposedly

'non-lethal' weapons like rubber-coated steel bullets and tear gas have

also killed unarmed civilians.       



<p>The increasing Israeli military presence throughout the West Bank, East

Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip is perpetuating the violence.  The UPMRC's 

first

aid teams are continuing to provide on-scene emergency medical services 

to

the injured.  Many new volunteers have joined our teams.           



<p>The UPMRC appreciates the expressions of support from the international

community.  We ask you to continue to pressure the Israeli army and

government to end military assaults against Palestinians in the West 

Bank,

East Jerusalem, Gaza, and inside the Green Line.

Israeli army's use of force against Palestinians over the past six

<h2>Text of report by Hamas web site on 1st October</h2>



<p>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate

This is an announcement to the people.

We are ready to sacrifice our lives and blood for the sake of Al-Aqsa.



<p>Let the Al-Aqsa intifadah and the clashes continue and let us turn the 

earth

into flames and a volcano under the feet of the usurpers.



<p>O our militant Palestinian people: If ye suffer hardships, they are

suffering similar hardships; but ye have hope from God, while they have

none. [Koranic verses] These are the blessed days, the days of jihad 

and

martyrdom and the days of God and the jihad for the sake of God and the 

days

for avenging Jerusalem and the holy places and Al-Aqsa and championing 

the

dignity of the Arab and Islamic nation. The precious Palestinian blood 

these

days is being heavily shed for the sake of Al-Aqsa Mosque. O our 

people,

remain steadfast once again in these days for you are the people who 

always

offer sacrifices and martyrs and are constantly generous and you are 

the

people who have pride and dignity and forbearance and steadfastness. O 

our

people, we exalt and admire you for your jihad and steadfastness and 

your

intifadah for the sake of Al-Aqsa and the holy places and for your 

strong

stand in the face of Zionist tyranny and aggression. We also exalt and

admire the pure martyrs and the hundreds of wounded whose pure blood 

has

stained the courtyards of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the blessed soil of

Palestine.



<p>O our steadfast Palestinian people: The intifadah of the blessed 

Al-Aqsa

Mosque will continue and persist and escalate to prove to the whole 

world

that our people have not become tired or weakened and will not 

surrender to

humiliation, oppression and occupation. This intifadah will also prove 

that

our people have been and will continue to be able to offer resistance 

and

sacrifices, confront the barbarism of the Jewish occupiers and their

covetous ambitions and oppression, and defend Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa

Mosque. The Zionist occupation army confronted our unarmed masses with 

tens

of thousands of its panicked soldiers and used live ammunition and

internationally banned bullets and armoured vehicles and 'LAU' missiles 

and

perpetrated heinous war crimes against the protesters from our people. 

All

of this confirms the truth about the imaginary peace with this enemy 

and

that coexistence between the victim and the gladiator is merely a big 

lie

because this criminal enemy only understands the language of brute 

force,

oppression, terrorism and the desecration of the holy places. This 

enemy

wants our people to completely capitulate to its will and conditions 

but our

people's blood that has been shed everywhere in our usurped land 

reveals the

truth about this rancorous enemy no matter how much the proponents of 

peace

and settlement tried to mislead our people and nation.



<p>This blessed intifadah is a strong response to the Baraq government's 

crime

of conspiring with Sharon and his followers against the Al-Aqsa Mosque 

and

allowing him to walk around its courtyards protected by thousands of

soldiers and military reinforcements. We did not see such military

reinforcements even when the Al-Aqsa Mosque was occupied for the first 

time.

This intifadah is also in response to the enemy's positions and 

announcement

of insisting on sovereignty over Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque and to 

the

statements by this entity's leaders about the establishment of their 

alleged

temple in Al-Aqsa Mosque. This intifadah and this blood is a strong 

message

that we will scorch the earth under the feet of the usurper and that

infringement on and desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque is prohibited area. 

Our

people, young and old, men and women, and old people and children will

resist it and blood will be shed and martyrs will fall.



<p>Our militant Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic nation: We in the

Islamic Resistance Movement [HAMAS] call for the following:



<p>First: On the domestic level:

<ol>

<li>Let tomorrow Monday, 2nd October 2000, be a day of a comprehensive

general strike and a day for intensive popular action on the 

anniversary of

Salah-al-Din's liberation of Jerusalem. We also call on the masses of 

our

militant people to continue with the Al-Aqsa intifadah and to escalate 

the

clashes with the enemy soldiers and hordes of settlers and confront 

them in

every city and village and every refugee camp, district and street of 

our

blessed Palestinian land. This is in order to protest the heinous 

massacres

perpetrated against our people and the desecration of Al-Haram 

Al-Sharif

[Jerusalem sanctuary enclosing the Al-Aqsa Mosque] by the Jews and to

emphasize our people's sovereignty over Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque.



<li>We call on our people to go to Al-Aqsa Mosque and stage a sit-in 

round

the clock to guard it and defend it. We also call on the students and 

pupils

to organize continuous group visits to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.



<li>We call on the university students and student bodies and school 

students

to stage massive demonstrations everywhere as an expression of our 

people's

anger and to champion the Al-Aqsa Mosque and holy places.



<li>We call for resorting to the use of the tools of the blessed 

intifadah in

terms of stones, catapults and Molotov cocktails and hand-to-hand 

combat and

let us turn our land into the battlefields of resistance, heroism and 

jihad.



<li>We call on our people to demonstrate solidarity with the families of

martyrs and to go to the homes of their families to offer them

congratulations on the martyrdom of their sons. We also call them to 

visit

the wounded and support them and offer them all the assistance and care 

they

may need.



<li>We call on the Palestinian [National] Authority [PNA] to immediately

withdraw from the negotiations with the criminal enemy and halt all 

forms of

security coordination with it.



<li>We call on the PNA not to try and halt the Al-Aqsa intifadah and 

calm our

angry masses as it did after the tunnel uprising. We also call on it to

stand in unison with the masses of our people and stand alongside them 

in

facing up to the aggression and to allow the people to express their

positions, defend the holy places and respond to the Jewish aggression.



<li>We call on the PNA to release all the strugglers detained in its 

prisons,

foremost of whom are the strugglers Mahmud Abu-Hannud and Muhammad 

al-Dayf,

so that they may stand in their proper place alongside the strugglers 

facing

and confronting the enemy.



<li>We proudly salute the heroic Palestinian soldier who opened fire on 

the

enemy soldiers and we condemn the PNA's decision to put him on trial,

especially at a time when the leaders and soldiers of the occupying 

entity

are committing massacres against our unarmed people.



<li>We salute our people in the part of Palestine occupied in 1948. We

salute their blessed stand alongside their kinfolk and their defence of

Al-Aqsa and the activities they have staged to express our people's

adherence to their blessed mosque and legitimate rights.</ol>

<ol>

<p>Second: On the Arab and Islamic level:

<ol>

<li>We appeal to the masses of our Arab and Islamic nation to initiate 

moves

to champion the Al-Aqsa Mosque and demonstrate solidarity with our 

people

and express their anger at the enemy's measures and massacres and its

desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call on them to stage demonstrations,

rallies and activities to support our people and stand alongside them. 

This

is in order to make the whole world realize that the blessed Al-Aqsa 

Mosque

belongs to more than one billion Muslims and that going anywhere near 

it or

infringing on it is a red line and a declaration of war against our 

nation

and its religion and dignity.



<li>We call on the Arab regimes, which have established any type of 

relations

and normalization with the criminal enemy, to stop dealing with the 

enemy

and to suspend all forms of normalization with it and expel its 

ambassadors

and representatives.



<li>We call on the Arab and Islamic peoples and governments to extend 

every

kind of material, moral and media support for our people and to support

their steadfastness and resistance and to support the strugglers.

</ol>

<p>Let the blessed Al-Aqsa intifada continue and let the Palestinian blood

continue to be copiously shed in defence of Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa 

Mosque and

let us turn our blessed land into a volcano and flames that scorch the

usurpers.



<p>Signed: The Islamic Resistance Movement [HAMAS], Palestine.



Dated: Sunday, 4th Rajab 1421 Hegira, corresponding to 1st October 

2000.

<h2>MADRE</h2>

<B>Women's Human Rights Organization Condemns Israeli Violence</B>

<p>New York, October 3, 2000-- MADRE, an international women's human 

rights

organization, strongly condemns Israeli military forces, which have 

killed

more than 50 Palestinians (including 13 children and an 18-month-old 

baby)

and wounded over 1,000. On September 28, Ariel Sharon, head of the 

Israeli

Likud Party, strong-armed his way onto the Temple Mount/al-Aqsa Mosque 

site

in Jerusalem, perhaps the single most contested territory of the

Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Flanked by over 1000 troops, Sharon's 

stated

aim was to assert exclusive Israeli sovereignty over the area, just as

Israeli and Palestinian leaders were poised to discuss sharing control 

of

the site.



<p>Sharon's provocation elicited protests by unarmed Palestinians. Israeli

troops opened fire on the demonstrators and Muslim worshipers and have 

since

escalated the violence to include the use of live ammunition, tanks,

helicopter gunships and anti-tank missiles. Most of those killed were

targeted with gunfire to the head and chest and most of the injured are

children. This arbitrary and excessive use of force violates 

international

human rights standards, which dictate that state security forces may 

resort

to gunfire only to save lives.



<p>US Secretary of State Madeline Albright termed Sharon's maneuver

"counter-productive." In fact, Sharon has a long history of brutality: 

In

1953 he led a massacre of dozens of Palestinian families in the village 

of

Qibia and in 1982 was responsible for the massacre of hundreds of

Palestinian refugees in Beirut, Lebanon. But true culpability for the

current killings lies with Israeli Prime Minister Barak, who neither

prevented nor condemned Sharon's provocation. As Defense Minister, it 

is

Barak who has mandated this week's horrifying escalation of military 

force.

Barak himself is seeking to place the blame on the Palestinian 

leadership.

The US media has given wide play to Israeli accusations that the 

Palestinian

Authority is "orchestrating the riots" for political gain. The 

mainstream

media's deceptively passive language of "people dying" and "violence 

raging"

obscures the reality of Israeli perpetrators and Palestinian victims. 

But it

is Barak's forces that are shooting anti-tank missiles into unarmed 

crowds.



<p>The big question in the US media is whether this violence will derail 

the

Middle East peace process. But it is precisely the failure of the peace

process to protect Palestinians from Israeli domination that is the 

source

of the frustration and despair that is fueling these militant 

reactions.

Supposedly, the peace process itself is based on UN Resolution 242, 

which

calls for Israeli withdrawal from all of the territories it conquered 

in

1967 -- including East Jerusalem. As Sharon's show of force 

demonstrates,

Israel refuses to comply with this Resolution. In fact, Israel's 

occupation

of Jerusalem has been characterized by illegal measures designed to 

push

Palestinians out of the city and erect Israeli settlements throughout 

East

Jerusalem. Palestinians have already agreed to relinquish 78% of their

country by recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the 1948 borders. 

Having

made this concession, most Palestinians insist that Israel not be 

allowed to

swallow up even more territory in East Jerusalem or other parts of the 

West

Bank.



<p>Today's fragile cease-fire is no substitute for a sustainable 

resolution to

this violence.

MADRE therefore:



<p>Calls on the Clinton Administration and the international community to

pressure the Israeli government for an immediate halt to this violence.

Calls on Israel to comply with UN Resolutions and international human 

rights

standards.

Calls on Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied in 1967, 

including

Jerusalem and to respect Palestinian rights, including the refugees' 

right

of return.
