<h3>PCHR</h3>

<b>Wide-ranged reinforcements of the Israeli occupation forces, Three Palestinian 
civilians, including a child, are killed </b> 
<p> The Israeli occupation forces have continued their killings and abuses against 
  Palestinian civilians, escalating their actions by shelling Palestinian cities 
  and villages. They have also strengthened the siege on the occupied Palestinian 
  territories and have reinforced their presence at points of friction with Palestinian 
  civilians. 
<p>This afternoon, the Israeli occupation authorities re-closed Gaza International 
  Airport. This morning, Sae'd Adnan Al-Tanbour, 17 years, from Nablus, died from 
  his wound by a bullet in the head in clashes with the Israeli occupation forces 
  on October 20, 2000; and the child Ashraf Habayeb, 15 years, from the Refugee 
  camp of Askar near Nablus, died from his wound in the head on October 16, 2000. 
<p>In the refugee camp of Tulkarm, Nada Sa'd Srouji died from a heart attack, 
  when Iaraeli soldiers chased her while she was trying to break the siege imposed 
  on Tulkarm. The number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli occupation forces 
  has increased to 119, and more than 3,300 have been wounded. 
<p>The Israeli occupation forces have reinforced their positions in the southern 
  part of the Gaza Strip, specially in Khan Yunis and Deir El-Balah. PCHR's field 
  officers reported that the Israeli occupation forces closed all branch entrances 
  to the two cities with cement blocks. They continued to place a roadblock on 
  the main road linking between the northern of the Gaza Strip with its south, 
  checking passing cars on both directions of the road. Al-Mawasi area in Khan 
  Yunis and Rafah witnessed intensive deployment of the Israeli occupation forces.
<p> The Israeli occupation forces swept a 4-donum area of agricultural land near 
  an Israeli military occupation they erected recently at the road leading from 
  Salah El-Din Street to Kissufim border crossing. Since the morning, in the area 
  of Erez, in the northern part of the Gaza strip, clashes have broken out between 
  Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces which have responded 
  opening fire. As a result, 19 people have been wounded with live bullets and 
  6 with rubber-coated metal bullets. Additionally, dozens were hurt due to inhaling 
  tear gas used by the Israeli occupation forces in the area. An eyewitness stated 
  that one of the wounded was trapped by to civil-uniformed persons who decoyed 
  him and fired at his knees. 
<p>The eyewitness added that the two persons appeared as if the were Palestinians 
  who would like to offer help for demonstrators. When Mahmoud Mansour Abu Rayya, 
  16 years old, from Jabalya, approached them, they fired at him. It is not clear 
  whether the two persons were soldiers of the Israeli occupation forces, or Jewish 
  settlers. PCHR's field officer in the area reported that 3 youths were wounded 
  without hearing the sound of firing. He asserted that the Israeli occupation 
  forces used silencers when firing at demonstrators.
<p> In Khan Yunis, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and the 
  Israeli occupation forces near an Israeli military site, known as "Al-Nouria," 
  to the west of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis. It is worth mentioning that some 
  Israeli military points within the site are less than 50m away from the over-crowded 
  refugee camp, and therefore, are a source of continuous threat to Palestinian 
  civilians in the area. A short while ago, the child Abdel Rahman Salim Shorrab, 
  13 years, was wounded in the head by a live bullet shot by the Israeli occupation 
  forces. He was evacuated to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis. 
<p>Additionally, 28 civilians were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets in Khan 
  Yuinis. Among them is the child Deeb Ibrahim Al-Najjar, 14 years, who was wounded 
  in the head, and was evacuated to Shifa' hospital in a very critical condition. 
  Dozens of civilians were also hurt due to inhaling tear gas used by the Israeli 
  occupation forces against demonstrators and nearby houses. In the vicinity of 
  the settlement of Kfar Darom near Deir El-Balah, clashes broke out between Palestinian 
  demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces which responded firing live 
  ammunition at the demonstrators. PCHR's field officer in the area reported that 
  two people were wounded by live ammunition, and dozens were hurt due to inhaling 
  tear gas. 
<p>Early this morning, the Israeli occupation forces fired two rockets at two 
  houses near Salah El-Din Gate on the borders with Egypt in Rafah. PCHR's field 
  officer in Rafah reported that one rocket penetrated the walls of the second 
  floor of a house owned by Saleh Mohammed El-Shae'r, 50 years, and exploded in 
  one of its rooms. The owner of the house told PCHR that he and his family sheltered 
  preemptively in the ground floor few minutes before shelling, as the house was 
  shelled during the past days. The house was severely damaged, and the room in 
  which a rocket exploded completely burnt. The second rocket hit the external 
  wall of a house owned by Mohammed Jamil Qeshta. No severe damages were reported 
  as a result. Yesterday, combat helicopters and tanks of the Israeli occupation 
  forces fired rockets at Beit Jala, Beit Sahour and the refugee camp of Aida. 
  Some houses and civil facilities, including a theatre and an electricity generator, 
  were severely damaged.
<p> PCHR warns of the new escalation by the Israeli occupation force and the killings 
  notably targeting children.
<p> PCHR asserts that the continued military reinforcements of the Israeli occupation 
  forces threaten directly the lives of Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied 
  Palestinian territories. Firing rockets at houses and civil facilities is a 
  clear evidence of the criminal acts and excessive use of force by the Israeli 
  occupation forces. 
<p>PCHR reiterates its call upon the international community and the High Contracting 
  Parties to Geneva Fourth Convention to give up silence and immediately intervene 
  to stop the continued massacres perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces. 
  Providing international protection for Palestinian civilians is the only way 
  that will ensure their security and safety.

  in the Occupied Territories and the violence committed against Palestinian civilians 
  by the Israeli Occupation Forces. 
<p>2. LAW demands that those responsible for this aggression against Palestinians 
  be investigated and brought to trial.
<p> 3. LAW calls on the United Nations Security Council to implement Resolution

<b> The Israelis have stationed checkpoints at the main entrances of the Palestinian 
cities "Deir Al-Balah and Khan Younis" </b> 
<p> On the evening of last Sunday dated October 22, 2000, the Israeli forces stationed 
  military checkpoints on the cross roads near the Israeli Settlements "Kfar Droum" 
  and "Gosh Qatif" nearby Deir Al-Balah and Khan Younis".
<p> Moreover, The Israeli Occupation army is stopping all the Palestinian cars 
  that are passing by the main street to search the passengers and confiscate 
  their personal rifles. 
<p>According to the Palestinian Police sources, which stated that, Israelis confiscated 
  the rifles of security personnel in Force 17 last night. Until present, the 
  occupation forces are using these procedures continuously. Also, they have close 
  the road to Al-Tufah quarter near the Israeli settlement "Gosh Qatif"- Khan 
  Younis. Israeli tanks and military vehicles filed Gaza - Khan Younis Main Street. 
  This led us to conclude that they are planing to disconnect and isolate the 
  Palestinian Cities and Villages.

<p><b>Further Israeli Violence as Six more Palestinians are Killed, Four of them 
  Children, and the Siege of Palestinian Civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
  Worsens</b></p>
<p> Despite international condemnation of Israeli practices, the Israeli Occupying 
  Forces continue to implement excessive and indiscriminate force against Palestinian 
  civilians. Yesterday and today, a total of six more Palestinians were killed 
  by the Israeli Occupying forces as they opened fire against Palestinian protestors 
  using assault helicopters, live ammunition, rubber- coated steel bullets and 
  various forms of tear gas.</p>
<p> According to information collected from al-Haq fieldworkers Na’el al-Zama’reh, 
  aged 25 from Halhoul in Hebron, Salah Fawzi Najm, aged 15 from al-Magazi Refugee 
  Camp in Gaza, Wael Amhouid al-Nasheet, aged 14 from Jabalya Refugee Camp in 
  Gaza and Imad al-Hawamdeh, aged 24 from al-Samou’ in Hebron were all killed 
  yesterday by Israeli Forces. Ashraf Ahmad Habayeb, aged 15 from Nablus and Sa’ed 
  Adnan aged 18 also from Nablus died today from injuries sustained a few days 
  ago in clashes in Nablus. In an act indicative of the Israeli forces’ indiscriminate 
  use of force, French journalist Jan Mari Brojois, aged 57 and another Palestinian 
  journalist were shot while covering the clashes. Jan Mari underwent surgery 
  for a live ammunition wound to the chest and remains in serious condition. , 
  today he was sent back home to France to continue medical treatment.</p>
<p> Last night the Israeli Forces launched a missile attack against the civilian 
  residents of Beit Jala. Two houses, the Orthodox Cultural Centre and a Marble 
  factory were targeted. Several injuries were reported.</p>
<p> Al-Haq views with concern the Israeli Occupying Forces latest military assault 
  of further isolation and surrounding of Palestinian cities and villages throughout 
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Reports to al-Haq indicate that the siege imposed 
  by the Israleli forces has tightened as more tanks, cement blocks and sandbags 
  have been placed outside of major Palestinian cities. The siege continues to 
  devastate the Palestinians economy and deprives Palestinians of their right 
  to move and live in freedom and dignity. </p>
<p>Al-Haq reiterates its call to the international community to intervene immediately 
  to pressure the Government of Israel to abide by international humanitarian 
  law and international human rights principles and treaties to which Israel is 
  a signatory in order to stop the systematic killing of the Palestinian people.

<p><b> VICTIM ACCOUNT: Settlers Attack 47-Year-Old Palestinian Woman With Leukemia 
  </b>
<p> 

<p>Sabha Sari 
  Abu Ali is 47 years old and suffers from leukemia, but that is not why she was 
  admitted to Ramallah Hospital on October 22. She was treated for the bruises, 
  internal bleeding and the pneumothrax (collapse of the lung) she suffered after 
  being attacked and beaten by two settlers in Turmus Sayyiya, a village near 
  Ramallah.

<p> “I was picking olives close to the settlement - its name is Shilo,” 
  Sabha said. “When I finished picking olives, a white car with [Israeli] plates 
  passed by. They stopped, got out of their car and started to talk to me in Hebrew. 
  I knew that they were settlers and that they were going to hurt me.” 

<p>Sabha tried 
  to run away from them, screaming while the settlers were chasing her. “I tripped 
  and fell and they caught up with me. Then they started to beat me and beat me 
  with no mercy.” “They picked up a rock and started beating me with it, here 
  and here, on my back and legs”. The blows she suffered caused rib fractures 
  and collapse of her left lung. “I was screaming and screaming when a shepherd 
  heard me. He was far away, but could hear my screams and saw what was happening. 
  He started to shout and yell. When they heard him, the settlers got in their 
  car and left very quickly. God had mercy on me because if it wasn’t for the 
  shepherd, they would have killed me.” Sabha is among the dozens of Palestinians 
  who have been beaten, shot at or harassed by Israeli civilian settlers. On October 
  17, in Beit Farouriq, settlers from Eit Mar attacked five Palestinians who were 
  picking olives. Two were critically injured. Farid Moussa, age 22, died because 
  the army did not allow the ambulance to enter into the village.

<p> Numerous incidents 
  have been reported of settlers terrorizing farmers while harvesting olives. 
  Since olives and olive products are a vital part of the local economy, the inability 
  to harvest the olives will have severe economic repercussions for farmers who 
  depend on this annual crop for income. Instead, many villagers report that their 
  land is being burnt and their olives stolen by the settlers. 

<p>The UPMRC stresses 
  its urgent appeal to the international community to press for international 
  protection of Palestinian civilians from the Israeli army and settlers.
