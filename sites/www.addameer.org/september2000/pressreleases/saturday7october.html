<B>Statement on Recent Events from the Association of International 

Development Agencies in Palestine</B>



<p>7 October 2000



<p>The Association of International Development Agencies (AIDA) views with 

great gravity the recent events that have taken place within the West 

Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and Arab towns within Israel.  



<p>Violent clashes which erupted Friday 29 September 2000, following a 

provocative visit by Likud Party head Ariel Sharon to the Al Aqsa Mosque 

compound in Jerusalem, have to date resulted in the deaths of 78 

Palestinians and three Israelis (Reuters, 7 October 2000). Among the 

fatalities are at least 20 Palestinian children. Over 2000 Palestinians have 

been injured, including hundreds of children. Particularly alarming is the 

number of injuries from live ammunition to the upper part of the body.



<p>We see how local medical workers struggle to provide emergency care to 

the wounded in facilities that are quickly overwhelmed by the numbers 

of casualties.  Of particular concern is the lack of immunity and safety 

for emergency medical personnel. Calls for donations of blood 

throughout the conflict areas continue.  An urgent appeal from the East 

Jerusalem Hospitals and the Palestinian Ministry of Health asks the 

international community to offer assistance in the purchase of medical supplies 

and medicines urgently needed for emergency treatment and surgeries. 



<p>AIDA is a group of over 40 international NGOs working with local 

communities.  A number of our members have been working here for over 50 

years. Some of us now find that our development and humanitarian work is 

hindered by the level of insecurity in Jerusalem and Palestinian 

territories and by the imposition of movement restrictions by the Israeli 

authorities.



<p>We are deeply alarmed at the escalating violence and the indiscriminate 

and excessive use of force exhibited since 29 September.  We are 

gravely disturbed at the number of civilians and young children who have 

become victims of the recent violence.



<p>In view of the above, AIDA:

<o>

<li>Urges all parties to do everything that they can to stop the 

current violence.  Both the Israeli authorities and the Palestine National 

Authority could play a useful role by calling for an end to all violence.



<li> Asks for an international commission of inquiry to investigate the 

indiscriminate and excessive use of force by the Israeli Authorities, 

violations of international law and human rights, and the causes of the 

violence that has claimed at least 81 lives.



<li> Urges the Israeli Government to immediately order its security 

forces to use only the minimum force in all situations.  The Israeli 

Government must be held responsible for violations by its forces' of 

international conventions and standards of human rights and humanitarian law, 

in particular the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the 

Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and its 1977 Protocols, and the 

1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.



<li>Urges the international community to bring all necessary pressure 

to bear to achieve the above points.</ol>

<B>LCHR is denouncing the killings of children & women and demands 

prosecuting both Sharone & Barak.</B> 



<p>In a very savage and barbarian scene that the world didn't witness 

before, the Israeli war criminals had shot the child "Mohammed El-Dorra". 

Through the last few days the Israeli barbarians were using tanks and 

helicopters to fight the unarmed Palestinians demolishing dozens of 

houses in an inhuman crime that caused up till now the death of 83 martyrs 

and the injury of over 2000 persons.



<p>In spite of all these bloody massacres, the international community 

didn't do anything but only blaming!! in a time that it could impose other 

countries to economic and political sanctions.

LCHR is denouncing the barbarism of the Israeli troops and its crimes 

against the unarmed Palestinians. At the same time, LCHR is urging the 

international community to take more effective procedures towards the 

Palestinians in order to protect them and to stop the Israeli bombing. 



<p>We also are demanding the prosecution of Sharone and Barak as war 

criminals to be judged against an international court and the immediate 

implementation of the international resolutions regarding the Palestinian 

issue and to enforce Israel to respect them.

LCHR is also urging the other countries to lend a helping hand to the 

Palestinians and to make some pressure on the Security Council  to issue 

an instant resolution to stop the massacre against the Palestinian 

women, children and old people.
