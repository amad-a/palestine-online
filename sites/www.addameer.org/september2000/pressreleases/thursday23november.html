<p><b>ISRAELI OCCUPATION FORCES LAY MINES AROUND
BLOCKADES SEPARATING
PALESTINIAN DISTRICTS</b></p>


<p>
At approximately 12:30am on 22 November, while Palestinian
residents
were attempting to remove a road block, which the occupation
army had
erected inside the village of Abu Da'eef, in the Jenin area, they
discovered four anti-personnel landmines buried inside the
blockade.
<p>Prior to this incident, approximately one week ago, a mine severely
injured 10 year old Khalil Atallah from Balatta Refugee Camp as he was
on his way to the bakery.  As Khalil neared the bakery, he came upon a
strange object, which he went to investigate.  He tried unsuccessfully
to open the object, and then threw it against a wall.  It exploded,
scattering a large number of metal fragments, severely injuring the
child.

<p>Defence for Children International/ Palestine Section, along with the
Palestinian Campaign to Ban Landmines, views with grave concern the
Israeli practice, which violates the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty prohibiting
the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel
mines. This practice also constitutes a violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949, which obliges the Israeli government, as an
occupying power, to provide for the protection and safety of the
occupied population.

<p>DCI/PS research on the magnitude and effects of the problem of
landmines and UXO in the West Bank revealed that Palestinians fall
victim to landmines and UXO explosions each year, with an estimated
2,500 injured or killed since 1967.  Moreover, the research indicated
that the majority of these victims are children. Since 1997 alone,
over 35 Palestinians have been injured or killed by landmines or UXO.
To date, the Israeli government has refused to sign the 1997 Mine Ban
Treaty.

<p>The recent discovery of anti-personnel landmines in Palestinian
civilian areas constitutes yet another element of an ongoing siege
against the Palestinian civilian population by the Israeli occupation
authorities.  Since 29 September, 87 Palestinians 18 years and under
have been killed, with an additional 7 declared clinically dead, and
approximately 2,700 injured.  Moreover, thousands of Palestinian
children have been traumatized by the daily exposure to extreme
violence.  In addition to the laying of anti-personnel landmines,
other Israeli practices in the recent period include firing live
ammunition and missiles from helicopter gunships and tanks into
Palestinian residential areas and restricting the movement of persons
and goods in and out of Palestinian areas.

<p>In view of this, DCI/PS calls on all international organizations
participating in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL),
as well as States Parties to the Ottawa Treaty, to intervene
immediately for the protection of Palestinian civilians.  Moreover,
DCI/PS urges international organizations to pressure the Israeli
government to cease its violations of the rights of Palestinian
civilians and to forbid the use of mines in Palestinian areas.

<p><b>Israel Continues To Attack Palestinians</b></p>



<p>This afternoon, in an assassination similar to that of Hussein
Ebayat,
Israeli forces fired an air-to-ground missile on the car of 34
year-old Ibrahim Bani Odeh, a father of 4 from the village of Tanoun.
He had been driving in Nablus town centre, on Jamal Abdel Nasser
Street in front of the Al Salam mosque.

<p>Bani Odeh was a Hamas member who had been held as a political
prisoner
by the Palestinian Authority due to his affiliation with the
organisation. He was released yesterday after three years in Juneid
prison.

<p>In Rafah, Gaza, 14 year-old Fathi Al Kurd was shot by Israeli
soldiers
in the head and chest with two live bullets and declared clinically
dead. Twelve others were also injured in Rafah, two of whom are said
to be in critical condition – Moussa Abu Ghneim (18), who received a
live bullet in the chest, and Khaled Abu Sneineh (17), who was hit in
the back also with a live bullet.

<p>Also in Gaza, Israeli forces fired a missile from their position at
Salah Al Din Gate, near the Gaza-Egypt border, onto a residential
area. The missile hit the home of Farouq Breika, inhabited by 16
members of his family. Eighty-five year-old Jundieh Ismail was injured
by shrapnel from the explosion.

<p>LAW demands that the State of Israel abide by the relevant provisions
of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

<p>LAW demands that the State of Israel implement United Nations
resolutions 242, 338 and 194

<p><b>The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continue to shell the
Palestinian civilians and to destroy their property</b></p>



<p>Following the killing of four Palestinian civilians in yesterday’s
incident near Rafah in the Gaza Strip, the Israelis shelled the
Palestinian cities of Rafah, Khan Younis, Ramallah, and al-Bireh.
As a
result several houses were damaged and one Palestinian civilian
was
killed. Another Palestinian civilian died due to earlier injuries.
Yesterday's 6 martys were:<p> 1. Awny Ismaeel Dhhair, 37 years old
from
Rafah. <p>2. Jamal Abd Alqadir Abd Arraziq, 29 years old from Rafah.
<p>3.
Samy Nasir Abu Laban, 30 years old from Annasr neighborhood in Gaza.
<p>4. Nail Salim Allidawy, 25 years old from Rafah. These four people
were killed near Rafah. <p>5. Najeeb Mahmoud Qishtah, 47 years old. He
was injured in the head by a rocket.<p> 6. Ibraheem Hasan Almqannan, 14
years old. He was shot in the head on 20/11/2000. <p>Today, 23/11/2000 in
the morning, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces opened fire on
Palestinian civilians near Salah Addeen border gate by Rafah. As a
result 13 Palestinian civilians were injured, three of them were
seriously so. These are: <p>1. Karam Fathy Alkurd, a 14 year-old resident
of Rafah injured in the head and chest. <p>2. Mousa Ibraheem Abu Ghnaim,
18 years old, injured in the chest. <p>3. Khalid Suleiman Abu Snainah, 17
years old, injured in the back.

<p>This morning at about 5:00 a.m. (3:00 GMT), the Israeli Occupation
Forces opened fire on several houses located near Salah Addeen border
gate. In this context, the house of Farouq Mohammad E’lian Braikah,
inhabitated by 16 people,  was shelled while they were asleep. As a
result, Jindiah Ismaeel Eid Braikah, 85 years old, was injured in the
hand, the house’s walls were cracked, and its windows and doors were
damaged. This morning also, at about 8:00 a.m. (6:00 GMT), Israeli
troops broke through the border line separating the Gaza Strip from
Israel near Beit Hanoun, and took over the Palestinian Border Force
base (16) located by the border line. 3 Palestinians were injured in
this incident.

<p>The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces are still blocking the main
roads in the Gaza Strip separating it into two isolated halves, and
continued to bulldoze lands and to destroy houses owned by
Palestinians. In this context, the following were observed: <p>1. 8
dunams, owned by Fuad Mohammad Ali Aljafarawy, and planted with olive
and date trees were bulldozed. An additional 34 dunams owned by the
same person were bulldozed two weeks ago. In the same incident, a
2-story villa owned by Fuad located in the same location was
completely destroyed. Its area was 250 square meters. In addition, the
house of a watchman whose area was 120 square meters was destroyed.
Moreover, the irrigation network and a water pump were damaged.<p> 2. The
foundations of 4 villas, the area of each of them is 250 square
meters, owned by Fuad Aljafarawy's sons, were severely damaged.<p> 3.  40
dunams, owned by Aidah Khadhr Mostafa Aljafarawy and planted with
fruit trees, were bulldozed. Her 3-room house located in the same
place was also destroyed. <p>4. 'Metalko' Aluminum factory owned by Fuad
Aljafarawy and Labeeb Arrayis was destroyed. The raw materials and an
electricity generator which were inside the factory were confiscated
by Israeli heavily armed soldiers before completely destroying, and
later bulldozing the one dunam piece of land on which the factory was
built. The loss resulting from this is about half a million $US.

<p>It is worth mentioning that the total area of land planted with fruit
trees, which were bulldozed by the Israelis in the vicinity of Kfar
Darom is about 1000 dunams.

<p>We, at Al-MEZAN Center for Human Rights, stress that the Israeli
aggressive acts are parts of a general Israeli policy aiming to impose
collective punishments upon the Palestinian civilians and creating a
state of starvation amongst them. The killing of Palestinians by the
Israeli army constitute extra judicial executions, thus they
constitute war crime. We request the international community to
immediately intervene to protect the Palestinian civilians and to put
an end to the Israeli violations of the human rights of the
Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.

<p><b>Petition to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Mary
Robinson
Endorsed by over 16,000<br>

Palestinians Demand INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION<br>
As a Step towards Implementation of their<br>
Right to SELF-DETERMINATION and Refugees' RIGHT of RETURN</b></p>




<p>Over 16,000 Palestinians, as well as individuals and organizations
worldwide, endorsed - within nine days of its launching - a petition
appealing to UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson to "call for the
implementation of the Palestinian right to self-determination and, as
a first step, to call for an international protection force for the
Palestinian people, before continued violence against the
Palestinian
society results in massive destruction for the second time in 52
years." The petition was signed, among others, by some 3,000 residents
of the cities and villages in the Hebron, Jerusalem and Ramallah area;
representatives of Palestinian political parties, public institutions,
NGOs and university student organizations; refugees and their
community organizations in the camps of 'Aida, Beit Jibrin ('Azza),
al-'Arroub, and Balata; over 100 representatives of political parties,
unions, women committees, NGOs and refugee organizations in Jordan,
Lebanon, and Syria; and more than 13,000 academics and professionals,
Palestinian expatriates, solidarity and human rights activists and
their organizations in Arab countries, Europe, Asia and the United
States.

<p>Implementation of international law and UN resolutions in our region
must no longer be conditional on the consent of the Israeli occupier.
The urgency of this Palestinian demand is highlighted by the Israeli
cabinet decision - in the wake of a Palestinian attack against Israeli
settlers in Gaza on 20 November - to escalate its military repression
of the Palestinian uprising by more intensive shelling of Palestinian
towns, villages and refugee camps, and to tighten sieges and blockades
aimed at strangulating the Palestinian people's economic and social
infrastructure. At this moment, and following the Israeli air-raid on
Gaza on 20 November, extensive shooting by Israeli military and
settlers, as well as shelling of Palestinian communities, is being
reported from all over the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. 250
Palestinians have been killed, 86 of them minors below the age of 18
(data of 21-11), and more then 10,000 injured since 28 September 2000,
and the Israeli government is determined to continue the colonization
of the 1967 occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, even at the expense of
another war in the Middle East.

<p>The petition, sponsored by Media Alternative on Palestine (MAP) and
BADIL Resource Center, was launched on 11 November 2000 on the
occasion of UN High Commissioner Robinson's visit to Palestine. It is
presented to her today, in order to emphasize the urgency of rapid
action by the UN Commission on Human Rights, both towards the UN
Security Council's vote on the deployment of international protection
forces expected for Friday, 25 November, and towards the establishment
of a new, rights-based and UN-supervised mechanism for a just and
durable solution of the historical Israeli-Palestinian conflict.



<p>AN URGENT CALL to MRS. MARY ROBINSON
UN HIGH COMMISSIONER on HUMAN RIGHTS

<p>WE, the undersigned, call urgently on Mrs. Mary Robinson to uphold, in
full, the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on behalf
of the Palestinian people, at this most critical and dangerous
historical juncture. In particular, we call on her urgently to affirm
Article #1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, which calls for the inalienable right of all peoples to self-
determination, and which continues to be grievously and systematically
violated by Israel's occupation, and by its refusal to accept the
right of return.

<p>The right to self-determination and continued occupation stand in
fundamental conflict. Continued occupation is the root cause of the
present situation. It is the machinery of occupation which produces
the systematic violation of the range of other individual and
collective rights provided for by the Covenant, including the right to
liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of movement, the
right to control one's own natural resources, and others. It is the
machinery of occupation which produces settlements, closures,
checkpoints, home demolitions, land confiscation, destruction of
crops, and wanton killings by settlers and occupation forces, which
the Palestinian people have continued to endure even during the last 7
years under cover of the peace process.

<p>Occupation can be maintained only by violence or the threat of
violence. Instead of respecting the principles of human rights and
international law, and acknowledging the Palestinian right to self-
determination, Israel has declared war on the  Palestinian people. It
has openly unleashed an arsenal of military violence against them. In
just six weeks, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and over
six thousand wounded. We demand a total end to the occupation. We
appeal urgently to the High Commissioner for Human Rights to call for
the implementation of the Palestinian right to self-determination, and
as a first step, to call for an international protection force for the
Palestinian people, before continued violence against Palestinian
society results in massive destruction for the second time in 52
years.

<p><b>Violation of Medical Immunity in Israel
The Police Force Hospitals Reveal Names of Arabs’ injured</b></p>


<br><br> According to reports we received from Arab citizens that were
injured
 last month, it was confirmed by Physicians for Human Rights, the
 Association for civil Rights and newspaper publications, that the
 Israeli police forced Hospitals to release names of Arab citizens
 that were injured during the October demonstrations.

<br><br>
As a result, this was a direct violation of medical immunity, which is
stated in the patient rights law and the ethics rule. We feel that the
Hospitals should have filed for an appeal.  The medical immunity
law
serves as a building block of trust between the medical staff and its
patients. Furthermore, it serves to promote the public interest in
treating every patient who is in need, equally. In this case, breaking
the immunity would prevent access to medical treatment.  For
example,
reports show that many injured civilians did not turn to hospitals for
medical treatment, from constant fear that the police would receive
their confidential information and records. This lack of trust will
only increase if medical personnel continue the transformation of
personal records to the authorities.

<br>
<br>The medical ethics, which is in the patients’ interest, should
overpower the court orders, which serve as an immunity law violation
by requesting confidential patient records. Due the importance of the
subject, the protests that occurred, that resulted in clashes when
extreme force was inflicted, caused many of these injuries, which were
not criminal or illegal. Furthermore, in a protest case, revealing
vital information results to tremendous civilian impact on the rights
of civilians to display their beliefs and frustration against the
governmental system in Israel.

<br><br> In addition, the information received by the police will be used for
 the purpose of investigating past events not preventing future
 dangers. The police utilize many different methods to locate
 individuals that have committed criminal acts.  In this case, the
 police are utilizing the same methods even though these incidents are
 not criminal matters.

<br><br> The information below reveal the Hospital staff answers to the
 questions of the Physicians for Human Rights and the Association for
 civil Rights:
<br><br>
 Rambam Hospital – Haifa
<br> An interview with Dr. Tsvi Ben Yishai , the spokesman of the
 Hospital, on the 9th of November revealed that, without a court
 order, Rambam Hospital transferred an injured list with full medical
 reports to the police.  Dr. Sasa, the police physician, requested
 these transfers.

<br><br>The Hospital claims that the release of the medical reports was a
mistake.  The hospital, under criminal cases, practiced such
procedures but in this case the police physician mislead the employees
at Rambam.  Dr. Ben Yishai stated, “I’m angry that the doctor mislead
me”.

<br><br> Naharriya Hospital
<br>
The Hospital claims that they did not receive a court order regarding
the transfer of medical records.  They refuse to reveal if they
transferred information to the police.

 <br><br>Haemeq Hospital – Afula<br>

They didn’t answer to the questions on this issue.
We would like to point out that according to reports from civilians it
appears that the same incident happened in Afula(Haemeq)  and
Naharriya as in Hafia.  This means, that without a court order, the
authorities received confidential information from hosptals.


<br><br>The Italian and English Hospital – Nazareth<br>
 A court order was released for the patient list that treated in
 Nazareth hospitals at the beginning of October to be transferred to
 the authorities.

<br><br>
In addition, according to the Police Health Department, a Hospital or
Doctor is not required to transfer information about a patient if they
feel that the information will offend or harm the patient in any way,
shape or form.  In an incident regarding a court order, by law, the
hospital should appeal. If not, they will be held fully responsible of
violating the immunity law. Accordingly, the Hospital or Doctor is
forced to compensate the patient for damages caused.

 <br><br>Lastly, we would like to conclude by stating that according to the
 patients rights law, the medical institutions are required to explain
 the legal procedures of transferring personal information.  In cases
 that require the transfer of information, the patients have a right
 to know what information is being transferred.  In the cases listed
 above, these procedures were never followed.
