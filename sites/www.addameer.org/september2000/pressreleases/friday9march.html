<b>Israeli Soldiers prevented Patriarch Michel Sabbah from entering Ein

Arik during a pastoral visit Jerusalem </b>


<p>
Israeli soldiers located at the checkpoint on the entrance to the

Village of Ein Arik near Ramallah prevented this afternoon Patriarch

Michel Sabbah, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, from entering the

mentioned village, despite learning who is the Patriarch and seeing

his Holy See Diplomatic passport and his VIP Card given to His

Beatitude by the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs. 

<p>
It is good to add that the Patriarch, who was accompanied by the

parish priests of Ramallah, was planning to celebrate Mass at the

Parish Church of Ein Arik this evening.

<p>
The Israeli Soldiers at the mentioned Check point refused even to

listen to explanations provided by Father Giovanni Cinti Parish priest

of Ein Arik, but obliged him to sit on the floor for sometime before

releasing him. Patriarch Sabbah couldn¹t succeed to enter yesterday

also the village of Bir Zeit  north of Ramallah, for celebrating Mass,

since the village was disconnected by Israeli Army from all its

surroundings.

<p>
We consider that this incident is a clear violation not only to

diplomatic relations and agreements between the Holy See and the State

of Israel, but a clear violation of the basic human rights of freedom

of movement.

<p>
We really wonder if such incidents happen to a senior clergyman, so

how is the daily life of the regular Palestinian citizens.

<p>
We appeal on the International community to make pressures on the

State of Israel to stop in end the actual siege and closure of almost

all the Palestinian villages and towns cutting it one from another

making of it a real small prisons in a very big prison which is not

legally, morally and humanly acceptable.

<p>
We are sure that this policy of collective punishment will not lead to

justice and peace, will not end violence they produce nothing tangible

for Israel or Israelis. They also do not increase security nor hasten

the possibility of a negotiated settlement. Justice and only justice

is the only solution for a real peace and security. We repeat and call

upon all of our friends all over the world to make their voices heard

to exert the utmost pressure upon their governments and the government

of Israel to stop these illegal measures of collective punishment.

Otherwise, we will face the brink of disaster.

<p>
Abeer Abu Khdeir, 32 years-old, from Shu'afat in the West Bank, mother
of four, was arrested by members of the Israeli Army, police and
undercover agents in the night of 21 February 2001 together with her
husband Nasser, after six hours of harassment that was not only
directed against her family including her four children, aged 2 to 12,
but also against all the families who live in the same building. Since
the day of her detention, 21 February, she has not been allowed to
meet her lawyer. On 4 March, her incommunicado detention was extended
for eight more days. This order may be prolonged at will. She is being
held in the interrogation section of the Russian Compound. 
<p>
Abeer Amer, 20 years old, from Dura near Hebron, and her sister, Sana
Amer, 14 years old, were arrested in Hebron on 20 February 2001. They
are awaiting trial in the Russian Compound. Abeer had been arrested
before, in 1999, and was released in August 2000.
<p>
Amne Muna, from Bir Naballah near Jerusalem, was arrested on 19
January 2001. For approximately five weeks she was not allowed to meet
her lawyer.
<p>
Wajdan Buji, 22 years old, from Hebron, was arrested on 25 February
2001.
<p>
Neve Tirza Prison<br>
On 1 March, WOFPP lawyer Taghreed Jahshan visited the political
prisoners, Maha Al-'Aak, Nasreen Taha, Suad Ghazal and Suna Gh'ai, in
Neve Tirza.. She had to wait for more than an hour to see the first
prisoner, while the lawyers visiting the criminal prisoners entered
without being delayed. -  From her report we learn the following:
<p>
The prisoners complain that recently the harassment against them has
increased. Under various pretexts on the part of  the prison
authorities, the women have been prevented from to visiting the
library for the past two months. Part of the library books they had in
their room have been taken away by the wardens. - The wardens have
also taken away drawing cardboard; they wanted to confiscate a piece
of  embroidery with the Palestinian flag that Suad had worked on for a
long time, but instead of surrendering it, Suad cut it to pieces. -
The newspapers still arrive in whole packages with one to two weeks'
delay. - The prisoners receive nearly no letters, and the letters they
write do not reach the families.* - Through the offices of the Red
Cross the family of Suad Ghazal and of Maha Al-'Aak respectively sent
clothing, blankets and sheets to their relative. The clothing was
handed over to Suad and Maha, but they did not receive the blankets
and sheets. 
<p>
In the the last week of February, a representative of the Red Cross
visited the prisoners in  Neve Tirza. 
<p>
Maha Al-'Aak, 22 years old, from 'Aaida Refugee Camp near Bethlehem,
was arrested 27 July 2000. The date for the continuation of her trial
has been set for 20 March. 
<p>
Nasreen Taha and Suna Gh'ai were detained in solitary confinement for
three days as punishment for not getting up when  an officer entered
their cell. (As a rule, the prisoners have to stand at checking times,
but not when an officer enters their cell).



<p>* Please inform us if you have written to any of the women prisoners
in Neve Tirza so that we can check.
