<p><b> Day 52
Siege Continues -14 year old killed in Gaza </b></p>





<p>The Israeli military’s closure of West Bank towns continues, with
further reports of Israeli bulldozers building outposts and barricades
at the entrances to Jenin, Al Bireh and Hebron and on the hilltops
surrounding the towns of Bethlehem, el Khader, Hebron, Nablus,
Jenin,
and Qalqilya. There are also reports that the Israeli military has
deployed more tanks and armored vehicles at the entrances and
exits to
these towns as well.

<p>In an attempt, to further block access to villages, settlers and
Israeli forces have dug 3-meter deep trenches across main access
roads
leading to the villages of Um Safa, outside Ramallah and Tura Al
Sharkiyeh near Jenin.

<p>This morning, Israeli forces stationed at the makeshift outpost in
Huwara near Nablus, arrested Husni Kalbuni a lawyer with LAW. His ID
was confiscated and he is still being held without charge.

<p>In the Gaza Strip, Israeli military bulldozers continue to move
concrete blocks onto roads linking the northern and southern parts of
the strip and on to access roads leading to Israeli settlements.

<p>This afternoon, Israeli forces fired on Palestinians near the Al
Mintar (Karni) crossing point killing Abdul Rahman el Dahshan, 14,
from el Zaitun Quarter in Gaza. He was shot with live ammunition in
the chest. Twelve other Palestinians were wounded, including five who
are in critical condition.

<p>So far, 211 Palestinians have been killed and more than 8,000 have
been injured since the outbreak of the Al Aqsa Intifada on September
29, 2000.

<p>LAW continues to demand that the international community ensure that
the Government of Israel complies with the relevant provisions of the
Fourth Geneva Convention, aimed at safeguarding the rights of
protected persons in situations of belligerent occupation. LAW further
demands the immediate implementation of all UN resolutions concerning
the conflict, and for international protection for the Palestinian
people in the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.

<p><b>Israeli occupation troops target the upper body: 
Palestinian child killed in Gaza
</b></p>

 


<p>Clashes erupted today between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces. These forces fired at Palestinian civilians, 
killing a 14-year-old child and wounding others, most of whom were 
children. Several areas saw clashes. Field information indicates that 
the Israeli occupation forces targeted the upper part of the body when 
shooting at Palestinian civilians, and that these forces did not 
resort to less lethal means to deal with demonstrators. In the past 
24 hours, the Israeli occupation forces shelled residential 
neighborhoods and civilian facilities, and swept more areas of 
agricultural land. 

<p>1. Shooting at Palestinian Civilians in the Areas of Clashes 

<p>In the area near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza City, 
the Israeli occupation forces shot at a number of Palestinian 
civilians, killing the child Abdel-Rahman Ziad El-Dahshan, 14 years 
old, from Al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza City, with a live bullet in 
the heart. PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that Israeli 
occupation troops, reinforced with tanks advanced to a short distance 
(30-40 meters) from Palestinian houses. He added that the area did not 
witness significant clashes when the Israeli occupation forces shot at 
a number of Palestinian demonstrators, killing the child El-Dahshan at 
about 10:30 local time. These forces did not resort to less lethal 
means before shooting live ammunition, obviously targeting the upper 
part of the body. These forces asserted their continued adoption of a 
policy of willful, cold-blooded killing of Palestinian civilians 
without any threat being posed to the lives of their troops. As a 
result of such shooting, 23 Palestinian civilians, mostly children, 
were wounded with live bullets, including: <p>1) Zharif Abdel-Fattah 
El-Gharra, 16 years old, from Al-Sabra neighborhood in Gaza City, 
critically wounded with a live bullet in the chest and currently being 
given treatment in the intensive care unit of Shifa’ hospital;<p> 2) 
Harbi Mohammed El-Ras, 27 years old, from El-Daraj neighborhood in 
Gaza City, wounded with a live bullet in the chest;<p> 3) Sufian Suleiman 
Salem, 18 years old, from Al-Shojae’ya neighborhood in Gaza City, 
wounded with a live bullet in the chest; <p>4) Ashraf El-Abed Eslim, 19 
years old, from Al-Shojae’ya neighborhood in Gaza, wounded with a live 
bullet in the chest; <p>5) Mohammed Samih Abdel-Hadi, 14 years old, from 
the refugee camp of Al-Shati in Gaza City, wounded with a live bullet 
in the chest; <p>6) Anas Dahesh Abu Nada, 16 years old, from Sheikh 
Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City, wounded with a live bullet in the 
abdomen; <p>7) Abed Samih Ja’rour, 14 years old, from Al-Yarmouk 
neighborhood in Gaza City, wounded with a live bullet in the back;<p> 8) 
Ayyoub Sha’ban El-A’marin, 14 years old, from Al-Zaytoun neighborhood 
in Gaza City, wounded with a live bullet in the abdomen; and <p>9) 
Mohammed Suhail El-Sarsak, 13 years old, from Al-Shojae’ya 
neighborhood in Gaza City, wounded with a live bullet in the chest. 

<p>Journalist Moaffaq Turki Qassem Mattar, 46 years old, a photographer 
of Falasteen El-Yawm (Palestine Today) Press, was also wounded with a 
rubber-coated metal bullet, while he was covering the clashes near 
Al-Mentar Outlet. 

<p>In the area to the southwest Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction, on Salah 
El-Din Street (the main road between the north and south of the Gaza 
Strip), dozens of Palestinian young men and children demonstrated 
since the morning more than 300 meters away from a military post of 
the Israeli occupation forces. Israeli occupation troops, reinforced 
with a tank and a number of jeeps, advanced on the branch road leading 
to Netzarim settlement in the west, and shot at Palestinian 
demonstrators 150 meters away to the south, wounding four with live 
bullets. Among the wounded was Mahmoud Kamel A’ckileh, 19 years old, 
from the area of Al-Mghragha, who was seriously wounded with a live 
bullet in the abdomen and was evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza 
City. 

<p>In Khan Yunis, this afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces shot at 
Palestinian civilians, wounding three with live ammunition, and 
another two with rubber-coated metal bullets. Among the wounded were: 
<p>1) the child Nedal Khamis Al-Khoreibi, 15 years old, wounded with a 
dumdum bullet in the back; and <p>2) the child Ahmed Kamel Abu Akar, 9 
years old, wounded with a rubber-coated metal bullet in the head, and 
evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City in serious condition. 

<p>In the village of Anza near Jenin, the Israeli occupation forces shot 
at Palestinian civilians, wounding five with live ammunition, 
including Alla’ Mohammed Atta El-Sheikh, 16 years old, who was 
seriously wounded with a dumdum bullet in the chest. 



<p>2. Shelling and Shooting at Houses 

<p>Yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces shelled Palestinian 
houses and civilian facilities near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet. PCHR’s 
field officer in the area has not been able to reach the shelled 
houses and civilian facilities to check the damage because the Israeli 
occupation forces closed the area. 

<p>3. Sweeping of Agricultural Land and Settlement Expansion 

<p>Yesterday, the Israeli occupation forces started to sweep 65 donums of 
agricultural land on the western side of Salah El-Din Street (the main 
road between the north and south of the Gaza Strip), 100 meters to the 
north of a military post at the junction leading to Gush Qatif 
settlement block (Al-Matahen junction). The swept areas, planted with 
olives and guavas, are owned by the two bothers Yousef and Abdel-Qader 
Abu Houli. This sweeping took place until 5:00 local time this 
morning. 

<p>4. Continued Reinforcements and Blocking of Roads 

<p>No changes have taken place concerning the reinforcement by the 
Israeli occupation forces of their presence throughout the occupied 
Palestinian territories. In the Gaza Strip, tanks and armored 
vehicles of the Israeli occupation forces are still stationed on Salah 
El-Din Street (the main road between the north and south of the Gaza 
Strip), near the roads leading to Gush Qatif settlement block and the 
settlements of Kfar Darom and Morag, and on the road leading to 
Kissufim Crossing in the east. Since this morning, the Israeli 
occupation forces have reopened Salah El-Din Street near Kfar Darom 
settlement, after it had been closed since November 14, 2000. However, 
Israeli occupation troops have continued to position roadblocks, 
obstructing the movement of Palestinian transportation. 

<p>In Rafah, all branch roads leading to Rafah Border Crossing have been 
closed since November 16, 2000. This increases the suffering of 
residents of Rafah and obstructs the access of farmers to their 
agricultural land near the Border Crossing on the Palestinian-Egyptian 
border. 

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have continued to isolate Al-Mawasi 
(agricultural) area in the west of Rafah and Khan Yunis, causing a 
deterioration in the living conditions of residents. This morning, 
Israeli occupation troops at Al-Tuffah roadblock between Khan Yunis 
and Al-Mawasi area obstructed the entry of two trucks of UNRWA loaded 
with flour and medicine for the residents of the area. PCHR’s field 
officer in Khan Yunis reported that the two trucks reached the 
mentioned roadblock at about 10:00 local time, and that Israeli 
occupation troops obstructed their entry into Al-Mawasi area until 
12:00 local time. He added that Israeli occupation troops also 
obstructed the passing of a car of ICRC for about half an hour. 

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have imposed a sea siege on the southern 
area of the Gaza Strip since November 10, 2000, preventing Palestinian 
fishermen from going out to sea. A number of fishermen stated that 
they have not been able to remove their nets from the sea since 
November 9, 2000. They believe that these nets will be damaged by the 
extended delay. 

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have kept up their actions of collective 
punishment by continuing to impose a total siege on the occupied 
Palestinian territories and by closing Gaza International Airport and 
Rafah Border Crossing. 
<p>
PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to 
immediately intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian 
civilians. PCHR calls in particular for: 

<p>1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in 
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and 
killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians. <p>2. Convening a conference of the High 
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure 
Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Convention.<p> 3. 
Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the 
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces. <p>4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights.<p> 5. Providing 
humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose 
living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the 
continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
entire occupied Palestinian territories.
