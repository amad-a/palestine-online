<p>



<p>Today, 2 November 2000, marks the anniversary of the 1917 Balfour
Declaration in which the British Foreign Office confirmed its support
for the Zionist movement's colonialist project of establishing a
"Jewish homeland" in Palestine. Today marks also the day after the
most heavy and violent Israeli military attacks on Palestinian
communities in the occupied West Bank since the start of the
Palestinian uprising ("Al-Aqsa Intifada") on 28 September. The
Israeli
military attack, launched Monday afternoon mainly against Aida and
Azza refugee camps, as well as the towns of Beit Jala, Bethlehem,
Beit
Sahour, and al-Khader village came to avenge an unprecedented
death
toll of three Israeli soldiers that day. Four hours of indiscriminate
Israeli shooting and shelling - from mortars, tanks, and helicopters -
at these Palestinian communities resulted in damage to homes and
enterprises and caused fear and panic among Palestinian residents
who
lack access to safe shelters. Today, Palestinian public institutions
and business are on strike, the population attending the funerals of
eight Palestinian victims killed in the last two days, and everybody
waiting to understand the implications of the latest agreement
brokered between President Arafat and Israeli Minister of Regional
Cooperation, Shimon Peres.

<p>Irrespective of whether the immediate future will bring the
continuation of the Palestinian uprising and its transformation into a
war of attrition with the Israeli occupation forces, or a success of
the latest Peres-Arafat cease-fire agreement, Israel's military and
political establishment has recognized the fact that neither the
current crisis, nor the historical Israeli-Palestinian/Arab conflict
can be solved by military means, but require a negotiated political
solution. The Palestinian people and its leadership, on the other
hand, have clearly expressed through the current uprising that they
demand a framework of political negotiations which is based on
international law and UN resolutions (especially UN Resolution 181
providing for a special international regime over all of Jerusalem;
Resolution 194 calling for the repatriation and restitution of
Palestinian refugees; Resolutions 242 and 338 calling for Israeli
withdrawal from the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967) and
active involvement by the international community, foremost the United
Nations. The experience with the abortive Oslo "peace process" has
shown that the Palestinian people strongly rejects the principle of
might makes right imposed by the powerful United States and Israel, as
well as the determination of the Palestinian people to obtain a
solution which meets universal standards of justice, international law
and democracy.

<p><b> ISRAELI FORCES CONTINUE CLOSURE, KILLINGS AND
CURFEWS
</b></p>



<p>Despite Israeli Brigadier-General Ron Kitrey's official statement
early this morning, that the Israeli forces would stop shooting,
withdraw heavy armour and lift the closure around Palestinian
communities, Palestinian youths are still being targeted and villages
are still under curfew.

<p>This morning, Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd of villagers
demonstrating in Hizma, outside Ramallah. Khaled Rezaq, 17, died
after
being shot in the chest and stomach by Israeli forces.

<p>Curfew in the southern part of Hebron has been imposed adding to the
current curfew in the Israeli occupied section of the city of Hebron.
Curfew continues in the villages of Sailat Athaher and Al Fonduqomeih
near Nablus.

<p>All Israeli checkpoints are still in place, blocking the movement of
Palestinians from town to town.

<p>Also this morning, Adli Abeid, 21 from Ashate' Refugee camp in Gaza,
died from injuries he sustained during clashes at the Al Mintar
passage on October 31, 2000.

<p>Last Night, Marwan Assaf, 21, from the Wadi village, was shot and

<p><b> TOTAL OF CHILDREN MARTYRS REACHES 51 ON THE
ANNIVERSARY OF ENTRY INTO
FORCE OF THE UN CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE
CHILD IN ISRAEL
</b></p>



<p>Nine years ago today, on 2 November 1991, the UN Convention on
the
Rights of the Child (CRC) entered into force in Israel.  The CRC, the
most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, was adopted by
the UN General Assembly in resolution 44/25 on 20 November
1989.
Article 4 of the Convention obliges States Parties to take "all
appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the
implementation of the rights recognized" in the Convention.  These
rights include, among others, the right to life (article 6), the right
to education (article 28), the right to be free from torture and other
inhumane treatment (article 37), the right to due process (article
37), the right to health care (article 24), the right to an adequate
standard of living (article 27), and the right to recreation and
leisure (article 31). Of  particular importance to Palestinian
children, article 38 of the CRC requires that States Parties ensure
the protection of children who are affected by armed conflict.

<p>As a States Party to the Convention, Israel is bound by article 2 to
ensure the rights contained therein, both in the territory of the
state itself, and in areas under its control. To date, Israel has not
only failed to implement the CRC in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories, it has also failed to submit the required country report
to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, required within 2
years of the date of entry into force by article 44.  Israel's report
is now 7 years past due.

<p>This past month, we have seen the tragic consequences of Israel's
failure to comply with its obligations under international law, both
those it has willingly assumed, and those to which it is bound under
customary international law. In a little over one month, 51
Palestinian children have been killed and an additional 3 have been
declared clinically dead.  These children ranged in age from 18
months
to 18 years old.   According to DCI/PS fieldwork, 44 died after being
shot in the upper body by Israeli military forces, including 23 shot
in the head, 17 in the chest, and 1 in the neck with live ammunition,
as well as 3 shot in the head with rubber coated steel bullets. In
addition, around 1,700 Palestinian children have been injured.
Moreover, there are literally thousands of Palestinian children who
have been traumatized by the daily exposure to extreme violence.

<p>Since the beginning of October 2000, thousands of Palestinian
children
in the Israeli controlled H2 area of Hebron have been virtual
prisoners in their own homes as a result of the continuous curfew
imposed on the area, a curfew that does not apply to the illegal
Israeli settlers residing in the area.  As a result, over 30
Palestinian schools have been closed, including 3 that have been
taken
over by the Israeli military and transformed into military
installations.  As such, approximately 20,000 children are denied
their right to education.  In addition are around 13,000 Palestinian
children that are currently unable to travel to school as a result of
the closure imposed on Palestinian areas.  With respect to children's
right to due process, tens of Palestinian children have been arrested,
subjected to physical abuse, including torture, and are currently
being detained without trial. One less obvious ramification of the
current crisis is the negative psycho-social affects such violence
will have on thousands of Palestinian children.  Professionals
participating in DCI/PS's crisis intervention project note that
symptoms diagnosed thus far are: bedwetting, under eating, over
eating, moderate depression, intense attachment to parents, and fear
of leaving home.

<p>While the entire civilian population has suffered as a result of the
Israeli attack, the affects on Palestinian children are most severe.
What we have seen in the past month is an intensification of ongoing
and systematic violations of Palestinian children's rights by the
Israeli occupation authorities and demonstrates both Israel's failure
to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law and the
international community's failure to insist that it do so. These
events not only constitute individual violations of the CRC, taken as
a whole, they constitute a betrayal of the spirit and intent of the
Convention itself. The extent and nature of the Israeli violations,
along with the international community's failure to ensure respect for
the treaty, set a dangerous precedent that threaten the protection of
children's rights globally.  In light of this situation, there is an
urgent need for immediate intervention by the international community
in order to guarantee protection of Palestinian children.

<h3>LAW</h3>
<p><b> ISRAEL'S EXCESSIVE AND INDISCRIMINATE USE OF FORCE:
EYE INJURIES
</b></p>





<p>On 29 September 2000, following Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to
Jerusalem's Haram al Sharif the previous day, clashes erupted
between
Palestinian civilians and the Israeli security forces in Jerusalem and
spread throughout the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and also within
Israel. In order to disperse demonstrations by Palestinian civilians,
protesting against the violation of their basic rights, the Israeli
army, police and Border Police used live ammunition and rubber
coated
metal bullets. The Israeli army also used heavy weaponry, including
tanks, helicopters and missiles. So far, the indiscriminate,
disproportionate and excessive use of force by the Israeli security
forces has resulted in a great number of Palestinian casualties. The
excessive use of force by the Israeli security forces has been
condemned by the United Nations Security Council in resolution
1322 of
7 October 2000, and by international human rights organisations like
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

<p>According to LAW's database, as of 2 November 2000, 148 Palestinians
have been killed and approximately 7,000 have been injured. Most of
the injuries sustained by Palestinians were in the upper parts of the
body. This raises the suspicion that the Israeli security forces are
pursuing a shoot to kill policy or at least one intended to inflict
serious injury on Palestinian demonstrators.

<p>Among those Palestinians killed and injured in the recent clashes,
many are minors under the age of 18. According to information
collected by the Palestinian branch of Defense for Children
International (DCI), as of 2 November 2000, 48 children have been
killed by the Israeli security forces since 29 September 2000. An
18-month-year-old girl, Sara 'Abdel Atheem 'Abdel Haq, from
Salfit/Nablus, was killed on 30 September when Jewish settlers shot at
the car her father was driving and hit her in the head. Additionally,
3 children have been pronounced clinically dead after being hit by
live bullets in the head. DCI further estimates that, as of 2 November
2000, around 1700 of those injured are children. At least 26 children
sustained eye injuries and at least four children are known to have
lost an eye.

<p>LAW has collected information from several area hospitals regarding
those who have sustained eye-injuries over the last month of clashes.

<p>From 29 September to 25 October 2000, Jerusalem's St. John Eye
Hospital has
treated 50 patients for eye-injuries. According to hospital staff, the
injuries treated involve bleeding of the eyeball and the orbital
tissues. Almost half the injuries (24) were caused by rubber-coated
metal bullets in the eye. In each of the 8 cases where a patient lost
an eye (two of them were children aged 101 and 122); the injury was
caused by rubber coated metal bullets. In addition to those who have
lost an eye, at least 11 other patients will probably suffer serious
permanent loss of vision as a result of their injuries, according to
Dr. David Leighton, a hospital staff member.

<p>Hospital records suggest that about 25% of the 50 patients treated at
St. John Hospital were children: 13 were children under the age of 18
and 2 had turned 18 this year. A 12-year-old boy from Nahaleen
(Bethlehem) was hit by settlers while he was picking olives, probably
with a blunt object, and sustained serious injuries. Two other
patients were also attacked by settlers.

<p>On 2 November 2000, Al Mezan Specialized Hospital in Hebron reported
treating 19 injuries since 29 September 2000, of whom 7 were children
with one as young as 18 months.  Most of the injuries were caused by
rubber coated metal bullets. Three patients who physically lost an eye
were transferred to St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem while
21-year-old Khaleel Abdel-Jaleel was sent abroad for treatment. The
rest of the cases (15) involved patients who were discharged but are
receiving on going treatment through follow-up appointments. In a
statement signed by the Medical Director Maghazi Tantawi, the
assessment is that most of these patients will have a permanent
partial loss of vision.

<p>As of 31 October 2000, Nasser Eye Hospital in Gaza has treated 51
people for eye injuries, the majority of whom (37) were children below
the age of 18. Ten of the patients have lost an eye, among them 5
children. According to the director of the hospital, Dr. Mahmoud
Nasrallah, 22 of the eye injuries treated were caused by rubber coated
metal bullets.


<p>Rubber Coated Metal Bullets

<p>With regard to rubber coated metal bullets, Dr. Nasrallah pointed out:

<p>"Rubber bullets are not really rubber bullets. They are metal bullets
coated with a layer of rubber, sometimes as thin as 1mm. If fired from
close range, as has been the case, these bullets do not only hit the
eye but penetrate into the brain."

<p>Dr. Aghlab Khouri of St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem, explained in
his affidavit to LAW the effect of the impact of a rubber coated metal
bullet to the eye:

<p>"The cases that have I treated during the clashes were cases of direct
shots to the eyes with rubber coated metal bullets. This kind of
bullet does not have a sharp end but has a piece of metal inside; they
hit the eye with great speed, creating an impact that shatters the
eye."

<p>Asked about the damage caused to eyes by rubber coated metal bullets,
Dr. Khouri explained:

<p>"The eye is like a small ball that is filled with a material that
resembles jelly. When a rubber bullet hits the eye the effect is the
same as if the ball was run over by a car; the result is that the eye
is squashed. Therefore, in most cases, the wounded eye requires
removal and is lost forever. However, if the injury does not lead to
the removal of the eye, it leads for example to shortsightedness or
even blindness. Some of the patients had a bullet lodged in the eye
orbit, damaging the bones and other tissues and leading to hemorrhage
around the orbit."

<p>From the hospital records and the case information collected, it
would be fair to conclude that many of the eye injuries sustained by both
children and adults were caused by shots fired at very close range.
For example, 12-year-old Ala Badra was shot from a distance of about
20 meters. Hussein Othman, 37, from Sumoud refugee camp was shot from
a distance of 3-5 meters only. As a result, he lost his eye. Ziyad
Fararja, 20, from Deheishea refugee camp, lost his left eye after
being shot from a distance of 10 meters. Awad Mansour, 33, from Al
Azariyeh, was shot from a distance of 20 meters and lost his left eye.

<p>Three Boys:  Case Studies

<p>Among the children who lost their eyes are Suleiman Musbah (11), Ala
Badran (12) and Ziyad Abu Baraka (14).

<p>According to press reports,on 30 September 2000, 11-year old
Suleiman Musbah from the village of Abasan al Kabir in the Gaza Strip
sustained an eye injury during clashes with Israeli soldiers at the
settlement of Kfar Darom. Suleiman was shot in the eye when he was
trying to remove an Israeli flag from the settlement in order to
replace it with a Palestinian one. The boy's eye was irreversibly
damaged and will require further treatment abroad.  It is unlikely
that this boy's actions posed a threat to the Israeli soldiers' lives.

<p>Twelve-year old Ala Badran, from the Old City in Jerusalem, was shot
in the eye with a rubber coated metal bullet, which also broke his
cheekbone and nose. Ala told LAW's field researcher,  "I was on my way
to my uncle's house in Kalandia; the house is near Jerusalem airport.
As I left my uncle's car near his home, an Israeli soldier pointed his
gun at me. He was only across the street. He fired at me and his
bullet hit my eye. My face and eye started bleeding. My mother took me
to Ramallah Hospital and later to St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem.
I have lost my eye forever." Ala will need further medical care.
However, his father is too ill to work, his mother is unemployed and
his uncles provide the sole support for the family.  While he was not
involved in any clashes, and posed no threat to the soldier who shot
him, he is now permanently handicapped.

<p>According to press reports, Ziyad Abu Baraka was badly injured during
clashes with Israeli soldiers at the Gush Katif settlement in the Gaza
Strip. An unexploded Israeli shell blew up immediately after he
touched it. He sustained burns to the face and chest and lost an arm
and both of his eyes. At 14, he is severely crippled for life.

<p>Two Women:  Case Studies

<p>Maha Awad is 36 years old, unemployed and lives with her family in Al
Bireh (near Ramallah) in a flat that faces the Jewish settlement of
Psagot. On Wednesday night, 4 October 2000, she was at home with her
parents and her brother. She recalls that:

<p>"At about 9 pm, we heard shooting in our neighborhood; it was
intensive random shooting. We did not know what was going on but we
were very scared. I closed my room and went to the balcony in order to
shut the door. At that moment I was hit in my right eye by a bullet,
which entered through the glass door of the balcony. I therefore
assumed that I was shot by a weapon with a silencer, as used by
Israeli snipers."6

<p>Maha was initially taken to Ramallah Hospital and later was
transferred to Al Raci Eye Hospital in Al Bireh. She sustained serious
injuries: her eye hemorrhaged and glass splinters injured her face.
Maha was, however, not the only person of the family to be seriously
injured that night. After taking her to hospital, her 54-year-old
brother, who was visiting from the United States, went back to their
home to get some clothes for Maha. When he went to see the spot where
Maha had been shot, he himself was shot in the stomach.

<p>Subhia Usam Jawabrah (38) lives in Arroub refugee camp between
Bethlehem and Hebron. She is married to a teacher who works at a
government school. His salary is barely enough to support his wife and
their 7 children. Subhia is 4 months pregnant. About 4 weeks ago, on a
Sunday evening, while looking after her children at home, she was shot
in her left eye with a rubber coated metal bullet. Subhia told LAW's
field-researcher:

<p>"On Sunday 1 October at around 6 pm, I was standing on the roof of my
house in Arroub refugee camp. My children were playing. In a distance
of about 100 meters there were clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian civilians. We could hear the shooting and watched what was
going on. Suddenly, I turned my head round; something had hit my left
eye. I was bleeding heavily from my left eye and from my nose and was
immediately taken to St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem." 7 Subhia's
medical records indicate that the injury sustained is very serious: a
black eye, a wound in her upper lid and hemorrhages in the orbit and
the conjunctiva, the transparent skin which covers the eye. Subhia has
lost clarity of vision in her left eye and it is not yet clear whether
she will be able to fully recover.  She already has a cataract in her
left eye. At the end of the meeting with LAW's field researcher,
Subhia said:

<p>"Why do we have to go through all this? Our life in the camp is very
hard. It is not the first time we are confronted with tear-gas and
shooting by the Israeli army. All my brothers and my husband have
spent time in Israeli prisons. Why can't we Palestinians have a normal
life in peace like the rest of the world?"


<p>IDF Open Fire Regulations and International Legal Standards

<p>IDF Open Fire Regulations

<p>The IDF Open Fire Regulations for the Palestinian Territories provide
that rubber coated metal bullets should only be used if other means of
riot control, such as tear gas and water jets are ineffective. In such
cases, rubber coated metal bullets should not be fired from a distance
of less than 40 meters. The firing of rubber coated metal bullets
should be aimed at the legs of a person identified as one of the
rioters or stone-throwers. It is prohibited to fire rubber coated
metal bullets at children.8

<p>Hospital records indicate that most injuries caused by the Israeli
security forces were caused in the upper part of the body. The serious
eye injuries sustained by many patients, including the physical loss
of an eye and permanent loss of vision, suggest that rubber coated
metal bullets were fired from distances of less than 40 meters.
Moreover, rubber coated metal bullets were fired at children as young
as 10, as was the case of Ibrahim Khalil Sabarneh, who lost his eye
after being shot in the face.

<p>From the facts outlined above, it appears that the Israeli forces are
acting in breach of their own regulations when dispersing demonstrations and
riots. Despite this fact, to the best knowledge of LAW, no
investigations into the deaths and serious injuries caused by the
Israeli security forces have been undertaken except in the killing of
Mohammed al Dura.9


<p>International Legal Standards

<p>With specific regard to children, the indiscriminate and excessive use
of force by the Israeli security forces in the recent clashes
constitutes violations of both international human rights law and
international humanitarian law.

<p>Israel is a state party to both the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child (CRC). Article 6 of the ICCPR states that "every human being
has the inherent right to life" and that "no one shall be arbitrarily
deprived of his life." Article 6 of the CRC specifically establishes
the right to life of every child and puts the state parties under an
obligation to "ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and
development of the child."

<p>Furthermore, in view of the particular vulnerability of children in
situations of armed conflict, article 38 (1) of the CRC emphasizes
that "State Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for
rules of international humanitarian law applicable to them in armed
conflicts which are relevant to the child."

<p>International humanitarian law, as established in the Fourth Geneva
Convention, provides in Article 27 that "protected persons are
entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons" and that
they shall be humanely treated and protected against all acts of
violence. Article 32 prohibits the signatories of the Convention to
take "any measure of such a character as to cause the physical
suffering ...of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition
applies not only to murder, torture...., but also to any other
measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents."

<p>Regarding the conduct of security officials, the UN established a set
of rules and principles, many of which have been violated by Israel's
use of excessive and indiscriminate force during the recent clashes.

<p>Article 2 of the 1979 UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials
provides that law enforcement officials shall "respect and protect
human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons"
in the performance of their duties.

<p>By the standards set out in the 1990 UN Basic Principles on the Use of
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, law enforcement
officials "shall not use firearms against persons except in
self-defense or defense of others against the imminent threat of death
or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly
serious crime involving grave threat to life..., and only when less
extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any
event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when
strictly unavoidable in order to protect life" (Principle 9).

<p>According to Principle 5, if the use of force and firearms is
unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall:

<p>"(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the
seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be
achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve
human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to
any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment."

<p>In the majority of cases, excessive force was used by the Israeli
forces in situations which posed no threat to their lives. In some
cases, those killed and injured were not involved in the violence. The
Israeli forces often fired indiscriminately into crowds of
demonstrators without regard to human life and without seeking to
minimize the risk of endangering uninvolved persons.

<p>LAW urges the members of the proposed international investigation
committees10 to examine this information and make use of current
findings collected by local and international human rights and medical
organizations. We urge the investigation committees to investigate
Israel's violation of international law and to draw its assessment
based on these facts.

<p>LAW also urges the international community to pressure Israel to
comply with its obligations under international law, specifically the
provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
and the Fourth Geneva Convention.

<h3>The Palestinian NGO Network (PNGO)</h3>
<p><b> URGENT APPEAL 
</b></p>




<p>For over 30 days, the Israeli military forces have continued their 
brutal acts against the Palestinian people, in cooperation with Jewish 
settlers 

and supported by PM Ehud Barak's Government. 

<p>In so doing, the Israeli government has escalated a very serious 
situation 
in the Palestinian territories. 

<p>In this context, the Palestinian NGO Network (PNGO) in the West Bank 
and 

Gaza Strip, the Union of Arab Community Based Associations (Ittijah) 
in Israel and the FORUM of Palestinian NGO in Lebanon affirm the 
following: 

<p>1. The situation in the country is becoming extremely dangerous, 
particularly in light of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's 
continuous threats to use heavy military force against Palestinians. 

<p>2. The increased danger is due to the openly aggressive policy of 
Barak's Government, providing full support to the armed Jewish 
settlers for acting on their own, through continuous attacks against 
Palestinian civilians. 

<p>3. The situation is becoming critical as settlers, supported by 
the Israeli Police and army, continue to impose their control over the 
West Bank and 

Gaza strip roads and continue their horrifying attacks against 
Palestinians. 

<p>4. The Israeli Military Forces have imposed a comprehensive siege 
on the West Bank and Gaza Strip by setting up stratetgically-placed 
military check-points. 

<p>For these reasons, our three Networks affirm the need for immediate 
international protection of Palestinian people in the West Bank, 
including Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip. 

<p>Finally, we believe that a permanent solution should address the true, 
underlying causes of the current deteriorating situation. Israel's 
continuing, 33-year long occupation is the main cause. Therefore, just 
and lasting peace cannot be achieved without first putting an end to 
the Israeli occupation and insuring Palestinian legitimate rights, 
including 

the right of return and the establishment of a Palestinian independent 
state, with Jerusalem as its capital.
