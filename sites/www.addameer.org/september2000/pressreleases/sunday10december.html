<p><b> DCI/PS LAUNCHES THE CAMPAIGN TO
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN</b></p>


<p>
On the occasion of the 52nd anniversary of the Universal
Declaration
of Human Rights, Defence for Children International/Palestine
Section
announces the launching of the Campaign to Protect the Rights of
Palestinian Children. In conjunction with the Campaign, DCI/PS has
posted a new section of its website, which features messages from
Palestinian children, suggestions for international advocacy, and
relevant resources for concerned individuals abroad, please see
http://www.dci-pal.org/campaign/campaign2.html.
<p>
The Campaign to Protect the Rights of Palestinian Children was
launched in order to increase international awareness regarding the
conditions in which Palestinian children live.  It seeks to mobilize
international support for the protection of Palestinian children.
Moreover, it strives to counter misinformation, both about the current
crisis and its affects on children, that permeates mainstream media in
the West. Above all, it seeks to remind the international community
that Palestinian children are like children everywhere.  They are sons
and daughters, brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews.  They have
names and birthdays and favorite toys, and they, like children all
over the world, dream of a bright future.
<p>
Since clashes erupted throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip at the
end of September 2000, we have seen the tragic consequences of
Israel's failure to comply with its obligations under international
law, both those it has willingly assumed, and those to which it is
bound under customary international law. As of 5 December, 85
Palestinian children had been killed as a direct result of Israeli
military and settler presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
In addition, an estimated 2,900 children have been injured and
thousands traumatized as a result of ongoing exposure to violence.
<p>
Unfortunately, what we have witnessed in the past six weeks is only an
intensification of the difficult circumstances Palestinian children
live under.  The primary cause of the Intifada is the basic denial of
Palestinian human rights resulting from the 33 year long Israeli
military occupation.  These ongoing, systematic, and institutionalized
violations affect every sphere of daily life for Palestinian residents
of the OPT. With particular reference to children, indicators of the
present situation were easily identified within the last year.  The
primary manifestation of an intensification of violations of children
rights was the re-implementation in 1999 of Israeli Military Order
132, which allows for the arrest, detention, and imprisonment of
children between the ages of 12 and 14, and the initiation of "mass
arrests" of Palestinian children. Military Order 132 had ceased to be
implemented in the period following the 1993 Oslo Accords.   With
reference to the work of the DCI/PS Legal Program, the effects of
increased violations were evident in the significant increase in the
number of cases with which the program dealt in 1999, as compared with
1998.  In 1998 the Legal Program followed up 89 cases of minors
arrested by the Israeli occupation authorities.  In 1999 that number
jumped to 202.
<p>
Similarly, in a report the Legal Program produced following the series
of demonstrations held between 11 and 28 May 2000, DCI/PS noted that
the Israeli military utilized live bullets, rubber coated steel
bullets, dumdum bullets and tear gas to disperse protestors.  Of
particular relevance to the current situation was the assessment that
Israeli soldiers appeared to be implementing a policy of shoot to kill
or seriously injure. According to DCI/PS documentation during this
period, four Palestinian children were martyred and 136 injured. Of
the injured, over 50% of the injuries (77 out of 136) were sustained
to the upper parts of the body. The distribution of injuries was as
follows: 30 were shot in the head, 44 in the chest and 43 in the lower
part of the body. Of the injured children, 93 were between the ages of
15-18, 39 between 10-14, and 4 between 5-9 years old.
<p>
Similar to the events in May, since the beginning of the current
Intifada, the Israeli military's use of force has been excessive and
disproportionate. Among other methods, the Israeli military has used
live ammunition, deployed snipers, helicopter gunships, and tanks, as
well as fired missiles into residential areas, in their attack against
Palestinian civilians. Particularly disturbing are the nightly attacks
on numerous Palestinian cities and villages, characterized by heavy
tank shelling and missiles fired from the ground and air. An
examination of the cause of deaths and injuries of children indicates
that the Israeli occupation forces are again implementing a policy of
shoot to kill or seriously injure.  With particular reference to
patterns of injury among children who were killed, 68 out of 85 died
as a result of wounds sustained to the upper parts of their body.

<p>Given the ongoing, gross, and systematic violations of Palestinian
children's rights, and the deteriorating overall human rights
situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, DCI/PS urges
international activists, organizations, and institutions to join them
in promoting and protecting the rights of the Palestinian child. For
more information about the Campaign to protect the Rights of
Palestinian Children, please contact DCI/PS (dcipal@palnet.com).

Settler aggression against Palestinians</b></p>
 
<p>
On Friday, outside the settlement of Qiryat Arba in the Baq'a valley, 
dozens of settlers occupied Atta Jaber's home, bringing in their own 
furniture and raising an Israeli flag over the house. They spent the 
night in the occupied house and on Saturday proceeded to spread around 
the hills, throwing stones at Palestinian houses and terrorizing the 
helpless residents. At about midday, a settler shot and seriously 
injured Mansour Naji Jaber, a 13 year old Palestinian boy. Mansour was 
shot in the arm and abdomen, and transferred to Hadasah hospital where 
he remains. The shooter, a 37 year old Qiryat Arba resident, turned 
himself over to the police today. All throughout Saturday settlers 
kept swarming to the house and were not prevented from doing so by the 
army, who was present in small numbers, or by the police, who were 
also present but under IDF orders. Armed settlers were allowed to 
pass, even after the child Mansour was shot. According to the IDF 
soldiers on the site, they were given orders to allow the settlers to 
stay. The settlers were eventually evacuated late in the evening but 
left the house burnt and severely damaged from the inside. The house 
has now been declared a closed military zone and no one is allowed to 
enter it until March, including Atta Jaber and his family. Atta's home 
has been demolished twice before, and his father's house, adjacent to 
Giv'at Harsina, has been under continuous settler attacks for weeks. 
Settlers have broken all the windows in his house (as well as in about 
a dozen more houses nearby), have uprooted grapevines, trees, and 
destroyed agricultural equipment.

LAW Reveals the Details of the shooting of a child in
              Hebron</b></p>
               
<p>
The Israeli security forces continue to deploy excessive lethal force
against unarmed Palestinian children. Based on its field
documentation
and information gathered on the 8 and 9 of December 2000, LAW
investigated the shooting of Ahmad el Qawasmi (15) from Hebron.
Ahmad
el Qawasmi was shot in the head by an Israeli soldier on Friday the
8
December.
<p>
In a sworn affidavit, Ashraf Julani, an eyewitness to the shooting
told LAW that “On Friday, December 8, 2000, at 13:45, while I was
sitting on the balcony of my home in Harit el Sheik, in downtown
Hebron, I heard intensive gunfire. I saw an Israeli soldier standing
with his foot pressed against the neck of a young Palestinian; I then
saw the soldier shoot the child in the forehead. There were four other
soldiers shooting eastward it an alley leading to the Ali Baka mosque.
I went down to the street to take the injured child to safety; he was
only 15 meters away. I carried him for almost 30 meters.
<p>
A number of soldiers ran after me and ordered me to put the child
down. They searched the injured child and then searched me. They also
pointed their guns at us. The search went on for five minutes. Then I
was told to take the child and leave. I carried him for another 100
meters to Bab el Zawyi where an ambulance took the child to hospital.
I later learned that the victim’s name was Ahmad el Qawasmi. He was 15
years old. He was in critical condition. Ahmad was shot in H1 area,
which is under Palestinian control. He did not threaten the lives of
any of the Israeli soldiers when he was shot.”

<p>The eyewitness added that Ahmad was bleeding heavily. LAW’s field
researcher was in the area when the soldiers opened fire but could not
reach the site where the incident had occurred due to heavy shooting.
However, the researcher went to el Ahli Hospital, where the wounded
child was admitted.

<p>Dr. Mohammad Dwaik explained the child’s condition to LAW’s
researcher; “the child was shot at point-blank range. The bullet
penetrated the victim’s forehead, damaged part of the skull and lodged
in the brain”. Two other Palestinians were wounded including Muhanad
el Hirbawi (15) who was shot in the pelvis and the right thigh.

<p>
Today in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers shot at Palestinian workers
who were fixing a school in Dir a bala. As a result, Walid el
Majedlawi was shot in the ear.
<p>
In Bethlehem, Mahmoud el Mughrabi (24) was shot and killed by
Israeli
security forces near the bypass road situated to the west of Beit
Jala. According to Israeli sources Mughrabi was preparing an
explosive
device shortly before the incident.
<p>
In Beit Djan village near Nablus, Israeli soldiers stopped Oreib
Younis (28) who was in labour, from getting to a nearby hospital. An
ambulance eventually reached Younis after the Village Council
contacted the DCO office.
<p>
Settlers and Israeli soldiers shot at children at the entrance of Beit
Furiek and Beit Djan Villages. One child, Hamada Afeef (15) was
wounded in the neck and right shoulder.
<p>
LAW calls on the international community to pressure Israel to respect
the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and to implement UN
resolutions 242, 338 and 194.
<p>
LAW calls on the Israeli security forces to abide by international
regulations concerned with the use of force by law enforcement
officials and to refrain from harming Palestinian civilians who do not
pose an imminent danger to the life of soldiers.
<p>
LAW calls on Israel to respect article 38 (1) of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child which stipulates: State Parties undertake to
respect and to ensure respect for the rules of international
humanitarian law applicable to them in armed conflicts which are
relevant to the child.

<p><b> 

On the 51st anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the international community is unable to protect Palestinian civilians </b></p>

<p>
Today, December 10, 2000, is the 52 nd anniversary of the adoption of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the UN General Assembly. 
The Declaration upholds the common ideal that humanity, through both 
governments and individuals, should pursue and seek to achieve rights 
and freedoms original to human nature. The approval of the 
Declaration in 1948 was the first occasion on which governments of the 
world approved collectively (through members of the UN) a declaration 
of human rights that became a guide and a reference point for 
humanity, as well as a standard for measuring the degree of respect 
for human rights. 

<p>As usual, the Palestinian people celebrate in their own way the 
anniversary of the Declaration, which was issued a few months after 
Zionist militias and the Israeli military uprooted and dispersed them, 
in one of the biggest and long-lasting ethnic cleansings in 
contemporary history. Since then, the Palestinian people have daily 
paid the price for the silence of the international community before 
killings, dispersion and massive violations of basic collective and 
individual rights perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces. 
Violations committed by the Israeli occupation forces reached their 
peak in the last quarter of 2000. During this time, the Israeli 
military faced the Palestinian people with weapons of destruction and 
killing because the Palestinian people reject occupation and insist on 
attaining their legitimate rights. The Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and other Covenants that constitute the International Bill of 
Human Rights ensure these legitimate rights. 
<p>
“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and human 
rights.” All the Palestinian people understand this provision of 
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the longing 
for freedom and the insistence on human dignity are fundamental to all 
the Palestinian people – children, elderly, women and men – in their 
struggle against occupation. The scenes of the last three months have 
exposed the cruelty and excessive resort to violence of the Israeli 
occupation forces. The response of the Israeli occupation forces to 
Palestinian civilians, who have continued their protests against the 
Israeli occupation since September 29, 2000, in what has come to be 
known as “Al-Aqsa Intifada,” has been harsh and totally 
disproportionate. The Israeli occupation forces have imposed a total 
siege on the occupied Palestinian territories, isolating them from the 
outside world. Tanks and armored vehicles of these forces have 
blocked the entrances of Palestinian cities and the main roads, 
transforming the occupied Palestinian territories into bantustans no 
different from the extinct apartheid reign in South Africa. Since 
September 29, 2000, the Israeli occupation forces have killed more 
than 271 Palestinians, including 96 children, and wounded thousands, 
many of whom will remain handicapped for the rest of their lives due 
to serious wounds in the upper part of the body. The use of lethal 
force by the Israeli occupation forces has not been limited to live 
bullets and banned dumdum bullets, but has gone so far as to include 
firing artillery shells from tanks, combat helicopters and gunboats at 
Palestinian civilians, residential neighborhoods and civilian 
facilities throughout the occupied Palestinian territories. Medical 
personnel have not been immune from attacks by the Israeli occupation 
forces. In addition to preventing these medical personnel from 
reaching wounded Palestinians, the Israeli occupation forces have shot 
at clearly marked medical vehicles, killing and wounding a number of 
medical personnel. Furthermore, the Israeli occupation forces have 
wounded a number of international and local journalists and reporters. 
Armed settlers have escalated their attacks on Palestinian civilians, 
and bulldozers of the Israeli occupation forces have swept thousands 
of donums of Palestinian agricultural land, destroyed agricultural 
facilities and demolished houses, displacing children, woman and the 
elderly. 

<p>PCHR is deeply frustrated by the failure of the international 
community to take effective measures in order to stop the grave 
violations of the international humanitarian law and human rights 
covenants perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces. PCHR 
appreciates the importance of the steps taken in the UN Security 
Council, the UN General Assembly and the UN High Commission on Human 
Rights following the visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to the occupied Palestinian territories; however, these efforts 
have not resulted in real guarantees to protect Palestinian civilians. 


<p>PCHR, on the 52nd anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, makes an appeal to the international community and 
organizations, and all human rights defenders in the world to 
immediately intervene to stop the grave abuses perpetrated by the 
Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian people, and to 
provide immediate international protection for Palestinian civilians 
in the occupied territories. Palestinian civilians continue their 
rejection of occupation and insist on obtaining their legitimate 
rights that are ensured by human rights conventions and the principles 
of international law, mainly the right to self-determination, the 
right to independence and the right of refugees to return to their 
homeland.
