<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br>

<p>(Washington, DC) -- Amnesty International today expressed grave concern for 

  the safety of civilians, following Israeli military helicopter attacks in Gaza 

  City and Ramallah which reportedly injured Palestinian civilians. 

<p>"The reports we are getting from our research team on the ground raise serious 

  concerns, and we appeal to the US and other governments to insist on respect 

  for human rights and protection of civilian lives," said William F. Schulz, 

  Executive Director of Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) 

<p>"Recent events have created a climate in which human rights violations will 

  flourish unless there is absolute respect for the rule of law, including fundamental 

  principles of human rights and humanitarian law," Schulz said. "Already about 

  100 people have their lost their lives and hundreds of others have been injured." 

<p>Israeli helicopter gunships fired on targets in Ramallah/al-Bireh and Gaza 

  City earlier today near the Palestinian Authority's headquarters in those towns. 

  There have been reports that civilians have been injured in Ramallah/al-Bireh. 

<p>According to media reports, the Israel Defense Forces has stated: "Army helicopters 

  today attacked Palestinian police buildings where two army reservists were lynched, 

  as well as other targets. ... This operation was a symbolic warning to the Palestinian 

  leadership to let it know we will not stand idly by in the face of violence." 

<p>The attacks appeared to be in response to the reported killing of at least 

  two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah/al-Bireh earlier today. The exact circumstances 

  of their deaths remain unclear. A group of soldiers were in the custody of the 

  Palestinian Authority at the Ramallah/al-Bireh police headquarters. A large 

  number of civilians reportedly entered the police station and attacked the soldiers. 

  According to media reports, the Palestinian Authority has stated that it made 

  all efforts to protect the soldiers, but was unable to do so, while the Israeli 

  government holds the Palestinian Authority responsible for the attacks. 

<p>"Today's events confirm the need for the United Nations to establish urgently 

  an independent international investigation to investigate all allegations of 

  serious human rights abuses that have taken place since 29 September in Israel, 

  the Occupied Territories and south Lebanon," Schulz said. <p align=right><A HREF="#top">back to top</A>

<b>ISRAEL ATTACKS NABLUS</b> 

<p>12 October 2000, 21.30 hours local time 

<p>Reports are now coming in that Israel has begun attacking the Palestinian National 

  Authority headquarters in Nablus with helicopter gunships. Details are being 

  collected and final verification should be available shortly. This is the third 

  Palestinian city that Israel has attacked today. 

<p>Earlier Israel bombed Ramallah and the Gaza Strip in actions that it claims 

  were in retaliation for the killing of two soldiers by Palestinians. However, 

  Israel's bombing appears to be an offensive attack the scale of which indicates 

  that a political motive. Both the motive and the attacks are in violation of 

  international law and should be ceased immediately. 

<p>Israel's actions are illegal under international law. The Fourth Geneva Convention 

  prohibits retaliation of any kind for any reason and requires military forces 

  to act with respect to life and, in particular, not to target civilians and 

  civilian installations. Israel has violated peace and security in the region, 

  and committed the region to a period of violence. 

<p>Law condemns Israeli aggression and calls upon the Security Council to hold 

  an urgent meeting to take affirmative action against Israel. 

<p>Background<br>

  In Ramallah, the second floor of the Al Bireh police station was destroyed and 

  Palestinian National Authority headquarters was bombed. 

<p>The Al Wahda Hotel and another building opposite the Al Bireh police station 

  had their windows blown in from the bomb blast. 17 people have been injured 

  and are being treated at Ramallah Hospital. 

<p>In Gaza, Israeli forces bombed the President's office, the Force 17 security 

  services, and the naval forces' buildings. 

<p>The actions follow from Israeli violence against Palestinians during the last 

  two weeks. Israeli forces killed 89 Palestinians, including 27 children, and 

  injured 3,676 Palestinians. Using excessive force indiscriminately, with the 

  sole intention of killing or seriously wounding Palestinians. 

<p>The violence began when Israeli hard-right politician Ariel Sharon visited 

  the Dome of the Rock compound. Sharon was involved in the 1982 massacre of thousands 

  of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps during Israel's illegal 

  invasion of Lebanon.

<b>ISRAEL ATTACKS TWO MORE PALESTINIAN TOWNS</b> 

<p>12 October 2000, 21.00 hours local time 

<p>Two additional towns have come under Israeli attack in this hour: Israel has 

  just begun shooting at Abu Snaina and Al Sheikh, suburbs of Hebron, with helicopter 

  gunships. 

<p>Israel is also continuing its attack on the Palestinian National Authority 

  headquarters in Nablus. The attack began with fire from helicopter gunships, 

  and they are now firing from the ground using anti-aircraft guns.

<b>RAMALLAH BOMBED BY ISRAELI FORCES</b> 

<p>12 October 2000, 14.30 local time 

<p>LAW's fieldworkers have reported that civilians areas in Ramallah are being 

  bombed. Law's fieldworkers are presently investigating the damage and reports 

  will be issued shortly. 

<p>Law condemns this escalation of violence. This is a serious violation of international 

  law, which absolutely prohibits retaliation of any kind. 

<p>Law is asking for States to call an urgent meeting of Security Council and 

  for the international community to demand that Israel desists from further military 

  actions. 

<p>LAW is writing to Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to 

  write to Israel to call a halt to these military actions. We have also asked 

  her to contact the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and the international community 

  to press Israel towards respecting international law and ending its military 

  attacks on Palestinians. 

<p>14.40. The Palestinian television studios in Ramallah has been bombed.

<b>URGENT ACTION</b> October 12, 2000 

<p>At 10:15 this morning in Ramallah, two armed Israeli undercover operatives 

  were discovered in a crowd of mourners who set upon them, beating one of them 

  to death and severely wounding the other. The Israeli military has been undertaking 

  military actions that strongly suggest severe retaliatory action. 

<p>LAW CALLS FOR AN URGENT INTERVENTION TO PRIME MINISTER BARAK TO DESIST FROM 

  TAKING ANY RETALIATORY ACTION AND TO ENCOURAGE ALL SIDES TO ACT WITH RESPECT 

  TO LIFE. 

<p>There are conflicting reports as to what happened, but credible sources give 

  the following version. 

<p>This morning, within a funeral procession for a Palestinian killed by Israeli 

  action, two persons in a Ford car, both carrying Israeli issued M16 automatic 

  weapons and wearing Israeli military fatigues, was discovered by the mourners. 

  On discovery, the two ran into the nearby Al Bireh police station. The mourners 

  rushed the police station, overpowering the police who sought to protect the 

  two men, beating one to death and seriously injuring the second. 

<p>It seems that the police were able to wrestle the dead man and the other from 

  the crowd and handed them quickly over to Israeli forces. 18 Palestinian police 

  were injured in the process, some seriously. 

<p>The Israeli military responded almost immediately. Reports describe a military 

  advance of men and heavy artillery and armoured vehicles from the north of Ramallah 

  near the City Inn Hotel, towards Ramallah/ town centre. Palestinian police and 

  Israeli forces engaged in a gun battle. The Israeli incursion was checked and 

  Israeli forces retreated back to Area B. The Israeli troops are said to have 

  fired indiscriminately with live ammunition in the advance and retreat, but 

  no injuries have yet been reported. 

<p>Four helicopter gunships are circling over Ramallah at low attitude. In light 

  of recent events, this would seem to be a precursor to missile attacks against 

  the civilian population. There is an exodus of Palestinians in fear of Israeli 

  retaliation. Ramallah has been sealed by the Israeli military forces and makeshift 

  checkpoints have been placed around the city closing it to all traffic. 

<p>The Palestinian National Authority has declared a state of emergency and high 

  military alert, as the risk of Israeli retaliation appears to be high. The Palestinian 

  security services have evacuated Palestinian families living near Israeli military 

  installation for their safety. 

<p>Eyewitnesses have reported tanks and missiles have been placed on alert and 

  are now being directed towards Ramallah from the high ground near the Beit El 

  Settlement. The Beit El military compound and settlement seems to have prepared 

  for conflict. 

<p>Law is regrets the loss of life. It is concerned that Israel instructed the 

  operatives to go into Ramallah at this time of significant tension. It is also 

  concerned that Israel may have re-launched a campaign of undercover executions, 

  a military practice that was consistently employed throughout the Intifada. 

<p>Reports are coming in that another Palestinian has been killed. Further details 

  will be reported when these become available. 

<p>There is a grave and imminent danger that Israel will retaliate using heavy 

  military force to the killing. 

<p>LAW IS CALLING FOR AN URGENT INTERVENTION TO ENSURE THAT NO ESCALATION OF THE 

  VIOLENCE OCCURS AT THIS TIME AND ALL PARTIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO LIFE.<p align=right><A HREF="#top">back to top</A>
