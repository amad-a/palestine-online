<b>AL-MEZAN Center seeks to relieve the suffering of the Palestinian
people</b>

                               
<p> 23/12/2000, Al-MEZAN Center for Human Rights has
held a new
public meeting in the context of its “ Face the public” program. The
meeting was held at AL-MEZAN center in Jabalya refugee camp.
<p>The title
of the meeting was: The Palestinian agricultural sector, How to
overcome the current crisis The main speakers were:
<p> - Mr. Mahmoud Abu Samrah, Director General at the Palestinian
 Ministry
of Agriculture.
<p> - Mr. Abd Alkareem Ashour, chairman of the union of agricultural
 relief
committees.
<p> - Dr. Kamal Alshrafy, a deputy at the Palestinian Legislative
 Council. - Mr. Isam Younis, director of AL-MEZAN Center for
Human
 Rights.<p>
This meeting was one of a series of meetings held by AL-MEZAN
center
in the context of its’ “ Face the public” program. The meeting
discussed several aspects related to the Palestinian farmers.
<p>
Mr. Isam Younis<p>
Mr. Isam Younis commenced the meeting with a short welcoming
speech.
Then, Mr. Isam described the “face the public” program briefly. He
stated that it aims to discuss the problems, which constitute grave
breaches to the economic, social and cultural human rights, faced
by
the Palestinians residing in the Gaza Strip. Mr. Younis mentioned
that
the meeting was the second in a 10- day period. He stressed the
importance of the meeting in discussing one of the aspects of
suffering from which the Palestinian people have been suffering as a
result of the Israeli aggression. The Israeli attacks, he added, had
targeted the Palestinian civilians, as well as their properties,
including houses and agricultural lands. The impact of the Israeli
aggression against the Palestinian people, he further added, has
affected the Palestinian individuals, non-governmental organizations,
and governmental organizational bodies. Then Mr. Younis stressed the
importance of the meeting, as it was the first one that concentrates
on the Israeli violations in regard to the Palestinian agricultural
sector. The aim of the meeting, he said, is to discuss the current
situation of the Palestinian farmers and landowners, and to find
possible alternatives to relieve their suffering. Mr. Younis said that
the meeting was supposed to be held in Deir Albalah, the area where
the large areas of agricultural land had been bulldozed. Another
meeting, he said, will be held in Deir Albalah to which farmers from
Alqararah, Khan Younis, Rafah, and Deir Albalah will be invited.
<p>
Dr. Kamal Alshrafy
<p>
Dr. Kamal Alshrafy commenced with thanking ALMEZAN center for
organizing the meeting saying: “ I welcome all of you. I thank “face
the public” program because it provides an opportunity for us to meet
an important part of the Palestinian people, those working in the
agricultural sector. This sector has been severely damaged. The
(unexpected) losses of the agricultural sector resulting from the
current Israeli aggression have been the biggest since 30 years. The
Israeli aggression against the Palestinian agricultural sector was a
planned and systematic one. Unfortunately, we were not ready to face
the Israeli aggression, which has affected all the Palestinian sectors
severely. The damage to the agricultural sector does not mean only the
destruction/ bulldozing of agricultural lands, but also the large
number of families who have lost their sources of income. This adds up
to the already high unemployment rate among the Palestinian
population, and decreases the share/ contribution of the agricultural
sector in the Palestinian Gross Domestic Product. It also totally
threatens the Palestinian “food industry”. How can we decrease the
extent of damage that has affected the agricultural sector” Then Mr.
Alshrafy stressed the need to reconsider alternative ways of dealing
with issue (by the Palestinian National Authority), such as creating a
state of equilibrium between our imports from and exports to Israel.
It is not accepted, he said, that we allow the entry of 100 trucks
carrying Israeli goods to the Palestinian Territories run by the
Palestinian National Authority, while Israel allows only 7 trucks
carrying Palestinian goods to enter its territories. Then he asked why
do not the Palestinian National Security Forces buy Palestinian
strawberries instead of Israel apples.  Then Dr. Alshrafy referred to
the role played by the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). He said
that the (PLC) had discussed the “agriculture draft law/ No. 80/2000”,
which aims to exert pressure towards the formation of committees,
whose function will be to estimate the losses of the Palestinian
farmers, and to find ways and suitable mechanisms to support them and
relieve their suffering. Then he referred to the obstacles delaying
receiving the financial Arab aids to the Palestinian national
Authority, and estimated the actually needed amounts of money. In this
context, he pointed out the generous Iraqi support. At the end of his
speech, Dr. Alshrafy stressed the importance of constructing and
actively participating in the discussions in order to reach reasonable
solutions.
<p>
Then Mr Isam Younis gave the word to Mr. Abd Alkareem Ashour, director
of the Union of Agricultural Relief Committees (UARC) in the Gaza
Strip.
<p>
Mr. Abd Alkareem Ashour
<p>
Mr Ashour commenced with thanking AL-MEZAN center organizing this
meeting and welcoming the attendees. Then he went through the damage
that affected the agricultural lands and water wells, pointing out
that it does not only affect the agricultural sector, but also creates
a state of poverty among the Palestinian community. He stressed that
the governmental as well as non-governmental sectors complement each
other. He said that the large- scale damage of the agricultural sector
necessitates cooperation between the Palestinian Ministry of
Agriculture and the non-governmental organizations dealing with the
issue, and that everybody should urgently act. Then Mr. Ashour listed
the actions taken by the ARCU in an attempt to overcome the
difficulties the agricultural sector is currently facing. He said that
the regular annual plan had been stopped and a major portion of the
ARCU’ s budget had been transferred to fund an “emergency plan” aiming
at dealing with the consequences of the Israeli aggression. He said
that the ARCU had tried to find alternative financial resources. He
stated that the “emergency plan” would cover the period extending from
1/12/2000 till 1/5/2001, and that it includes: 1. Distribution of
seeds and animal food stuff, which started on 15/12/2000. 2.
Replanting the bulldozed/cleared agricultural lands, which will start
as soon as it becomes possible to reach these lands. 3. Building
special pools for collecting rain water in order to substitute the
destroyed ones. 4. Creating new roads in agricultural areas to ease
reaching these lands, and cultivating new lands. 5. Creating job
opportunities for the farmers in cooperation with PECDAR and Ata’awon/
Cooperation foundations. Mr. Ashour, then, referred to the role played
by the ARCU in buying the olive’s oil from the farmers and then
selling it to the consumers at cost prices., which helped to support
the farmers.
<p>
Then Mr. Younis thanked Mr. Ashour and gave the word to Mr. Mahmoud
Abu Samrah, Director General of the Palestinian Ministry of
Agriculture.
<p>
Mr. Mahmoud Abu Samrah
Mr. Abu Samrah commenced with thanking AL-MEZAN Center and welcoming
the attendees. He said that the current Israeli aggression is the most
severe. Then he stated that the Ministry of Agriculture had modified
its plans in order to accommodate with the new situation. The regular
plans and programs have been stopped, he said, and a new “emergency
plan” has been developed in an attempt to overcome the large-scale
damage that affects the agricultural sector. He pointed out that
Israeli military bulldozers, protected by Israeli tanks, were still
bulldozing agricultural lands in Deir Albalah area. He further said
that “emergency committees” has been formed in the different areas of
the Gaza Strip. Besides, “technical committees” were formed to
estimate the losses of the agricultural sector. In this context he
said that many agricultural areas can not be reached because Israeli
forces positioned in or near them open fire on whoever approaches
them. Mr. Abu Samrah said that all the farmers had been affected by
the Israeli aggression. This includes those who grow vegetables and/or
fruits and those who own chicken coops and/or sheep/cattle fields.
Then Mr. Abu Samrah presented his vision for overcoming the
difficulties. These are: 1. Production of juices, which necessitates
cooperation among the farmers. 2. Formation of “follow up” committees
in the different provinces of the Gaza Strip, whose function will be
to distribute the relief aid, sent to the farmers. 3. Planting new
sorts of crops and fruits in the Gaza Strip such as apple trees. He
said that this would exempt us, as Palestinians, from importing 100.00
Tons of apples from Israel. 4. Cooperation and coordination between
the governmental and non-governmental sectors. In this context, he
requested the “human Rights” organizations to follow up the Israeli
attacks from the legal aspect in order to force Israel to compensate
for the losses it caused. This, he said, will prevent Israel from
committing similar crimes in the future. Abu Samrah stressed the
importance of cooperation among the farmers in regard to all the
discussed issues as it helps to find alternative solutions.
<p>
Then Mr. Isam Younis talked about the role of “Human Rights”
organizations, referring to the “Presidential Resolution” confirmed by
his Excellency the Palestinian president, Yasir Arafat, in regard to
the formation of a National Documentation Committee”. This committee,
he said, consists of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of
Non-governmental Organizations’ Affairs, the Palestinian Center for
Human Rights, and AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights.
<p>
Then the stage was open for discussion, and the attendees were given
opportunities to express their opinions in regard to the issues raised
during the presentations. The attendees, whose number was about 100,
participated actively in the meeting, raising issues directly related
to the agricultural sector. Many farmers and representatives of
agricultural non-governmental organizations were amongst the
attendees. One of the questions raised was about the exportation of
strawberry. Mr. Abu Samrah replied by saying that the Israelis were
responsible for the delay, and pointed out that the Israelis are
preventing the transfer of special laboratories, donated by Spain, to
the Gaza Strip. Mr. Abu Samrah also stressed the need to create a
cooperation- mechanism among the Ministry of Agriculture, the
non-governmental agricultural organizations, and the farmers. He
referred to the Ministry’s role in developing plans aiming at creating
job opportunities for the farmers (agriculture-workers). He pointed
out that the Ministry’s role is only a technical one. He complemented
the Ministry of Finance for its promise to grant loans to the farmers
aiming to facilitate the “juice industry” and relieving the burden of
fees paid per each exported Ton of agricultural products through the
international airport of Gaza. In this context, the Palestinian
Aviation Authority requests $US 1500 per Ton despite the fact that his
Excellency, President Yasir Arafat resolution that limits the fee by
only $US 800.

<p>Then Mr. Ashour stressed the importance of maintaining quality of the
products high in order to succeed in marketing them in the Arab
countries and worldwide.

<p>Then Mr. Alshrafy stressed the importance of the political factor in
overcoming the current crisis.

<p>At the end of the meeting, the attendees requested to continue to hold
similar meetings.

<p><b> 
Weekly Report on Israeli Human Rights Violations 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territories  </b></p>
<p>

Introduction 
<p>
This report covers violations perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces against Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian 
civilians during the period of December 28, 2000 – January 3, 2001. 
This period witnessed a significant escalation of violations 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces, despite the occupied 
Palestinian territories seeing a significant decrease in mass clashes 
between Palestinian civilians and Israeli forces. During this period, 
the Israeli occupation forces continued to resort to the use of lethal 
force and willful killing at times when no threat was posed to the 
occupying forces. These forces also continued to commit political 
assassinations against Palestinian political activists, the last of 
which was the assassination of Dr. Thabet Thabet, Secretary of Fatah 
Movement in Tulkarm, on December 31, 2000. During the same period, 
the Israeli occupation forces and settlers killed six Palestinians, 
including three civilians, one of whom was a 12-year-old child who was 
killed by shrapnel from an artillery shell fired by the Israeli 
occupation forces when the shell fell onto the roof of the house of 
his family in Hebron on December 31, 2000. Among the victims were two 
Palestinian security men who were killed by the Israeli occupation 
forces in cold blood in Tulkarm on December 31, 2000, when there were 
no clashes in the city. A third Palestinian security man was killed 
when the Israeli occupation forces shelled a post of the Palestinian 
National Security Forces in the east of Beit Hanoun on December 28, 
2000. During the same period, the Israeli occupation forces continued 
to fire artillery shells and heavy and medium bullets at Palestinian 
cities, which resulted in killing a child, wounding a number of 
civilians and causing severe damage to houses and civilian facilities 
in some cities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israeli 
occupation forces also continued to sweep areas of agricultural land 
and to demolish houses and civilian facilities, especially those near 
settlements and on the sides of roads used by the Israeli occupation 
forces and settlers. 
<p>
At the beginning of the new year, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces 
toughened the siege imposed on the occupied Palestinian territories. 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak stated that his army must prepare 
for a comprehensive war, that his forces would toughen the siege in an 
unprecedented way and that he would allow the entry of only basic 
necessary materials for humanitarian purposes. In effect, the Israeli 
occupation forces closed Rafah Border Crossing on December 30, 2000. 
On January 1, 2001, these forces also closed Gaza International 
Airport, Al-Karama Crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, 
Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet and Beit Hanoun (Erez) Crossing. On the 
morning of Tuesday, January 2, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces 
closed the two main roads between the governorates of the Gaza Strip 
(Salah El-Din Street and the coastal road, which was closed for the 
first time), and all alternative branch roads, isolating the Gaza 
Strip and dividing it into three separate areas. Similar measures 
were taken in the West Bank that divided it into dozens of separate 
areas. 
<p>
1. Restrictions on Free Movement 
<p>
The Israeli occupation forces have continued to impose a total siege 
on the occupied Palestinian territories. In addition to the 
prohibition of movement between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
through Israel, the Israeli occupation forces toughened the internal 
siege imposed on Palestinian cities, isolating these cities from one 
another (in the Gaza Strip this took place on Tuesday, January 2, 
2001). At the same time, large numbers of settlers were present on 
bypass roads, shooting at Palestinian civilian cars and throwing 
stones on Palestinian civilians. In recent developments concerning 
the total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
occupied Palestinian territories, this siege has included: 
<p>
1) Preventing Travel Abroad 
<p>
Since Saturday, December 30, 2000, the Israeli occupation forces have 
closed Rafah Border Crossing, preventing travel to Egypt. In the 
evening of Monday, January 1, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces 
closed Gaza International Airport and Al-Karama Crossing between the 
West Bank and Jordan. With these measures the Israeli occupation 
force have completely prevented the travel of Palestinian citizens 
abroad. In addition, these forces continued to impose restrictions on 
the movement of Palestinian citizens between the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip. 
<p>
2) Closing Commercial Crossings 
<p>
Since the evening of January 1, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces 
have closed Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza City. The 
Mentar (Karni) Outlet is devoted to commercial exchange through 
Israeli territory. Now only the entry of basic necessary materials is 
allowed. These force have also continued to close Sofa Crossing, near 
Rafah, and Beit Hanoun (Erez) Crossing in the north of the Gaza Strip. 
<p>
3) Restrictions on Internal Movement 
<p>
On the morning of Tuesday, January 2, 2001, the Israeli occupation 
forces closed the coastal road between Gaza City and the middle area 
of the Gaza Strip. While continuing to close Salah El-Din Street (the 
main road between the north and south of the Gaza Strip) and all 
alternative roads, the Gaza Strip became separated into three 
completely isolated areas: Rafah and Khan Yunis, the middle area, and 
Gaza City and the northern area. 
<p>
On the morning of Tuesday, January 2, 2001, Israeli occupation forces 
positioned near Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction, to the south of Gaza 
City, prevented the passage of a Palestinian ambulance in which there 
was a pregnant woman coming from a clinic in Deir El-Balah. The 
blocked patient was on the way to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City. 
PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that Mrs. Meriam A’amer 
El-Akhras, 30 years old, was in serious condition and critically in 
need of a Caesarian operation that cannot be performed in the middle 
area of the Gaza Strip due to the lack of necessary medical equipment 
in nearby local clinics. The occupying forces also prevented the 
passage of a Palestinian ambulance in which Rajab El-Sa’afin, 70 years 
old, and Safeya El-Kurd, 70 years old, from Deir El-Balah, were 
traveling in order to receive medical care at Shifa’ hospital in Gaza 
City. PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that the occupying 
troops forced the ambulance to travel back to the middle area, 
preventing its passage to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City. 
<p>
On January 3, 2001, the Israeli occupation forces prevented the entry 
of Palestinian newspapers published in the West Bank, including 
Jerusalem, into the Gaza Strip. The major daily newspapers, Al-Quds, 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda, are published in Jerusalem and 
Ramallah. 
<p>
2. Shooting at Palestinian Civilians 
<p>
Tuesday, January 2, 2001 
<p>
In the morning at approximately 7:00 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces shot dead Sabri Awadh Ibrahim Khader, 51 years old, 
from Jabalya, with a medium caliber bullet to the right shoulder 
(below the neck). In his testimony to PCHR, an eyewitness – the 
victim’s nephew – said that he was with his uncle and a number of 
their family members working in a grove, about 700 meters away from a 
military position of the Israeli occupation forces in Dogit settlement 
to the north of Beit Lahia, when the shooting took place. At 
approximately 7:20 (local time), the sound of an explosion was heard 
and two minutes later the Israeli occupation forces positioned in the 
area of Dogit settlement opened fire arbitrarily and intensively. 
Palestinian farmers were forced to flee to nearby houses in order to 
take shelter from the shooting. The eyewitness added that his uncle 
was not among those who escaped. When the eyewitness returned to his 
work place after the shooting stopped, he found his uncle lying on the 
ground bleeding. The motionless farmer was evacuated to hospital, but 
died as a result of the shooting. 
<p>
Also in the morning, at approximately 9:30 local time, Israeli 
occupation forces positioned on Salah El-Din Street, near Al-Shuhada 
(Netzarim) junction, to the south of Gaza City, opened fire on an 
UNRWA vehicle, while it was on its way to Gaza City. The driver of 
the car, Ashraf Weshah, survived, though the front right tire was hit 
by a live bullet. 
<p>
Monday, January 1, 2001 
<p>
In the morning, at approximately 10:30 local time, an Israeli 
occupation soldier shot at Jadallah El-Ja’bari, 32 years old, from 
Hebron, wounding him with two live bullets in the leg. A videotape 
filmed by an Associated Press cameraman showed the cruelty of the 
crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces. The victim was 
passing through the market of the city when he was shot from a very 
close distance. El-Ja’bari, who works in the sanitation department 
for the municipality of Hebron, was evacuated to Hadassa hospital in 
Jerusalem. 
<p>
Sunday, December 31, 2000 
<p>
In the morning, at approximately 7:00 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces opened fire on a number of Palestinian laborers 
waiting for security checks at the gate of Erez industrial zone. As a 
result, five of these laborers were wounded. In addition, a driver of 
an ambulance for the Health Work Committees was wounded while he was 
offering help to one of the wounded. PCHR’s field officer in the 
northern area of the Gaza Strip reported that the wounded were: 1) 
Alla’edddin Ahmed Khater, 23 years old, wounded with a live bullet in 
the left foot; 2) Oudeh Mahmoud Abu Shehadeh, 22 years old, wounded 
with a live bullet in the left hand; 3) Sae’d Ja’far El-Harazin, 23 
years old, from Al-Shojaeya neighborhood in Gaza City, wounded with a 
live bullet in the left knee; 4) Mohammed Mohammed Nasser, 23 years 
old, from Beit Hanoun, wounded with a live bullet in the left knee, 5) 
Yasser Abdullah El-Rantisi, 21 years old, from Nusseirat, wounded with 
a live bullet in the abdomen; and 6) Ibrahim Ahmed Shabat, 32 years 
old, from Beit Hanoun, an ambulance driver, wounded with a live bullet 
in the right thigh while offering assistance to one of the wounded. 
He was wearing a special uniform designed to identify medical staff 
when he was wounded. 
<p>
Also in the morning, at approximately 9:00 local time, Israeli 
occupation forces positioned at the borderline to the east of 
Al-Boreij refugee camp shot at Jerar Oudeh Mahmoud Abu Shehadeh, 20 
years old, from Al-Maghazi refugee camp. Abu Shehadeh was wounded in 
the head by shrapnel from live bullets. PCHR’s field officer in the 
middle area of the Gaza Strip reported that the area did not witness 
any clashes when the Israeli occupation forces shot at Abu Shehadeh 
from a distance of more than 100 meters. 
<p>
Also in the morning, at approximately 9:30 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces asassinated the Secretary of Fatah Movement in 
Tulkarm, Dr. Thabet Thabet, 49 years old. Dr. Thabet was from the 
village of Ramin and a resident of the city of Tulkarm. Dr. Thabet 
was in his car in front of his house in the southwest of Tulkarm, when 
the Israeli occupation forces opened fire on him from a distance of 
more than 250 meters. Eyewitnesses said that Israeli occupation 
troops stationed a military truck at a junction leading to a military 
roadblock of the Israeli occupation forces and suddenly opened fire on 
Dr. Thabet’s car when there were no clashes in the area. Dr. Thabet 
was wounded with several bullets in the chest and was evacuated to 
Tulkarm hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10:00 local time. 
This crime is the first one against a Palestinian political 
organizational figure in the past three months, and is regarded as a 
significant escalation of the assassination policy adopted by the 
Israeli occupation forces against persons whom these forces deem to be 
executive members of Palestinian organizations. 
<p>
In the evening, at approximately 19:30, settlers opened fire on a 
number of Palestinian young men near the northern entrance of the 
village of Hazma to the east of Jerusalem, killing Tahrir Suleiman 
Rezeq, 20 years old, with a live bullet in the head. 
<p>
Also in the evening, at approximately 21:30 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces shot dead two members of the Palestinian National 
Security Forces (Military Intelligence) in Tulkarm. Eyewitnesses said 
that Israeli occupation forces positioned in the west of the city of 
Tulkarm opened fire on Mou’taz Mohammed Sae’id Serouji, 37 years old; 
and Tariq Ibrahim Ahmed El-Qatto, 31 years old, killing the former 
with live bullets in the head, the neck, the chest and the thighs, and 
the latter with live bullets in the head, the back and the thighs. 
<p>
Saturday, December 30, 2000 
<p>
In the evening, at approximately 22:00 local time, Israeli occupation 
forces positioned in the vicinity of Kfar Darom settlement shot at 
Oudeh Mahmoud Abu Samra, wounding him with a live bullet in the left

north of the mentioned settlement when he was shot. 
<p>
Friday, December 29, 2000 
<p>
In the afternoon, at approximately 14:30 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces shot at Ahmed Abdullah El-Maghayzha, 24 years old, 
from Deir El-Balah, wounding him with a live bullet in the left leg. 
El-Maghayzha said that he was on his way from Al-Qarara to his house, 
30 meters to the north of the road leading to Kissufim Crossing on the 
borderline. When he crossed the road towards his house, Israeli 
occupation soldiers, positioned on the roof of a house they 
expropriated last November, shot at him, wounding him with a live 
bullet in the left leg. 
<p>
Also in the evening, at approximately 17:00 local time, Israeli 
occupation forces positioned at the borderline in Rafah opened fire on 
a number of Palestinian civilians, wounding three with shrapnel from 
bullets. PCHR’s field officer in Rafah reported that the three were 
evacuated to Al-Joneina hospital in Rafah. They are: 1) Jaber Ihasan 
El-Natour, 14 years old, wounded with shrapnel in the head; 2) Ahmed 
Mohammed Abu A’rmaneh, 15 years old, wounded with shrapnel in the

<p>
Thursday, December 28, 2000 
<p>
In the afternoon, at approximately 15:30 local time, the Israeli 
occupation forces opened fire on a post of the Palestinian National 
Security Forces, to the north of Beit Hanoun in the north of the Gaza 
Strip. The Israeli occupation forces also fired an artillery shell at 
the mentioned post, killing a member of the Palestinian National 
Security Forces, Mahmoud Ali Mahmoud Nusseir, 33 years old, from Beit

<p>
3. Shelling of Residential Neighborhoods 
<p>
Tuesday, January 2, 2001

<p>
Monday, January 1, 2001

killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces. <p>4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights.<p> 5. Providing

"DON'T LET ETHNIC CLEANSING WIN" 
Prevent the Erosion of International Law </b></p>

<br><br>
Washington, DC (January 3, 2001)- In a letter sent to the Palestinian 
Authority, the United States and the European Union, the Palestine 
Right to Return Coalition (known in Arabic as Al-Awda) wrote that "no 
agreement, negotiations or parties which purport to trade away the 
right of return or any other inalienable rights can have any legal 
basis and cannot bind or compel the Palestinian people to end the 
struggle for the fulfillment of their internationally recognized 
rights." 
<br><br>
It stressed that any attempt to abrogate the rights of Palestinian 
refugees would set a disastrous precedent in international human 
rights law, providing a clear signal that ethnic cleansers who expel 
civilians from their homes, steal their property, and prevent refugees 
from returning for a lengthy period can expect to have their illegal 
territorial conquests blessed with international legitimacy. 
<br><br>
Implementation of the right of return as spelled out in UN resolutions 
is key to a peace based on a just resolution of the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
<br><br>
Today, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat has accepted the joint US-Israeli 
formula for a final settlement with "reservations," following meetings 
in Washington with President Clinton. The U.S.-Israeli proposals, also 
known as the "Clinton Plan," call for the abrogation of the 
Palestinian refugees' right of return as well as the annexation of 
parts of the occupied territories to Israel. 
<br><br>
The Clinton proposals, as widely leaked, clearly and explicitly call 
for the cancellation of the right of return for Palestinians forcibly 
expelled from their homes in 1947 and after. 
<br><br>
As new rallies for the right of return are currently being planned for 
April 2001, the Palestine Right to Return Coalition (PRRC) as well as 
Palestinians in general and human right activists will continue to 
insist on the immediate implementation of pending United Nations 
resolutions and respect for universal human rights. It emphasized the 
legal and moral obligation of the parties to support the 
implementation of the right of return of Palestinian refugees as a 
step towards a just peace in the region.

<p>
We would like to bring to your attention two most serious incidents
involving violations committed by the Israeli army against PRCS
personnel, vehicles and buildings.
<p>
Dec 31, 2000 - 10 pm. The national headquarters in Al-Bireh was
fired
upon and hit today.  Heavy machine gunfire from the nearby
settlement
of Psagot was directed at PRCS hitting the building, and five parked
vehicles including PRCS president's car, causing extensive
damage. No
one was injured.  We would like to point out that the  building is
well lit through out the night with flood lights pointing in all
directions.  A backup generator ensures that power is not out for
longer  than 10 seconds. Water tanks on the roof were punctured
and
must be  replaced.  The following vehicles were hit by what seems
to
be 500 mm  caliber guns:

<p> 1. Ambulance, GMC plate number 5-8502-91 bullets in the body behind
 the
left
 rear door.
<p> 2. Peugeot Mini bus for the school of the hearing impaired, plate
 number
6-0483-96 bullet shattered the two side windows.
<p> 3. VW caddy transport plate number.5-1444-99, , hit by bullet in the
 front
window.
<p> 4. Transport Toyota plate number. 5-1073-96 bullet in the rear right
 door
and going through the rear left door.
<p> 5. VW bus plate number 5-7188-48 bullet in the body above the rear
 wheel 6- Transport Toyota plate number. 5-1072-96 (PRCS president
 car) three
bullets in the body.
<p>
Dec 21, 2000, a PRCS ambulance heading north and transporting a
seriously injured Palestinian to the Ramallah hospital was stopped at
an Israeli army checkpoint near the Kalandia-Jerusalem airport.  The
ambulance was searched and boarded by two armed soldiers, and after
extended delay, forced at gunpoint to drive in the opposite direction.
Upon arrival at the major North Jerusalem check point, the PRCS crew
was ordered out of the vehicle, had their personal ID cards & radios
confiscated, and then an army medic provided care for the victim, who
they apparently intended to arrest.
 An Israeli military ambulance later arrived, and the victim was
transferred  to that vehicle.  The PRCS crew were then interrogated by
Israeli police and  released after an ICRC delegate intervened onsite.

 <p>PRCS would like to highlight the following deplorable acts by the
 Israeli army: 1. Hindering emergency medical care by stopping and
 holding the ambulance at the road block 2. Boarding the ambulance by
 armed soldiers 3. Forcing the crew at gunpoint to turn around in the
 opposite direction 4. Confiscation of radio equipment and denying the
 crew communication with central EMS dispatch 5. Confiscation of
 personal ID cards for medical personnel 6. Interrogation of the crew
 by police and security forces

 <p>PRCS will continue to provide care for all in need including Israeli
 soldiers and civilians.  We conduct our activities with the highest
 standards of humanity and care.  The seizure of the para-medical crew
 and the ambulance is an intolerable act that contravenes
 international humanitarian law
