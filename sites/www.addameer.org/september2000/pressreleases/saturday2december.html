Israel Promises to Loosen Restrictions for Ramadan  While Tightening the Closure Imposed on
the Occupied Territories Restricting Palestinians’ freedom of Religion during the  Muslim and
Christian Holy Months</b></p>

<p>
Last week Israel announced to the world that as a “good will gesture” during Ramadan the closure imposed on the
Occupied Territories would be relaxed and that worshipers of all ages would be allowed to pray at al-Aqsa
Mosque. However, on 30 November 2000, the Israeli military authorities also decided that the preexisting closure
of the Occupied Territories would be tightened banning all Muslims from the West Bank and Gaza from praying at
al-Aqsa Mosque.<p> Yesterday marked the first Friday of Ramadan. Traditionally, to mark this occasion over
250,000 Muslims pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque. The denial of access to Muslims living in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to the Mosque cut the number of worshipers at the Mosque to only 25,000. The closure of the West Bank
was tightened with extra checkpoints set up to ensure that residents of the Occupied Territories did not reach
Jerusalem.<p>Some individuals tried to reach Jerusalem to pray but were turned back and several were beaten and
detained.<p> Yesterday also marked the official start of the Christian Advent season. Generally, Christians
from all over the world come to Bethlehem to celebrate Christmas but events have been cancelled this year due to
the violence.<p> Palestinian Christians living inside Israel are denied access to pray at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem and Christians living in the West Bank and Gaza are not permitted to enter Jerusalem to pray at the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.<p> The actions of the Israeli Authorities are a clear violation of Article 27 of the
Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that an occupying power must provide for the protection of the religious
convictions and practices of the occupied party. It is also a violation of Article 46 of the Hague Convention of
1907.<p> The closure of the last two months may have been a response to the actions of individual Palestinians or
settlers. The effect of these measures, however, is to collectively punish the entire Palestinian population. Such
collective punishments are illegal under international law.<p> The total and indefinite closure of the Occupied
Territories that has now been imposed poses an acute threat to Palestinian community life and particularly to
freedom to Religion.<p>Al-Haq calls upon the international community to demand that Palestinians’ right to
religious freedom be respected.<p> Al-Haq also reiterates its call to all High Contracting Parties to the Fourth
Geneva Convention to signal to the Israeli Authorities that they will not tolerate grave breaches of the Convention.
Al-Haq urges the international community to pressure Israel to abide by the numerous international instruments that
it has willingly ratified. In light of ongoing violence, and the continuing failure of the Israeli Forces to ensure the
safety of the Palestinians, al-Haq again calls upon the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to
provide and/or guarantee protection for Palestinians living under Israeli Occupation

<p><b>
UN General Assembly Condemns Israeli Control of Jerusalem
</b></p>






<p>The Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and
Democracy (MIFTAH) welcomes the resolution adopted at the UN
General
Assembly on Friday, 1/12/2000, condemning Israel's imposition of
its
control on Jerusalem.

<p>The resolution, which was overwhelmingly adopted with a 145-1 vote
(only Israel voted against it), called Israel's imposition of ".its
laws, jurisdiction and administration" on Jerusalem illegal, and,
therefore, null, void, and has no validity.

<p>MIFTAH reiterates that Israel is an illegal occupier in Jerusalem; its
unilaterally declared sovereignty over the city is in grave violation
of international law. Jerusalem is on the agenda of final status
talks, and its fate must be in accordance with UN Resolution 242 and
other relevant resolutions, as well as the Fourth Geneva Convention.

<p><b>
UN Committee in Geneva Expresses "Grave Concern" over Reports of 
Israel’s Gross Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 
the Occupied Territories 
</b></p>

<p>For More Information Contact: Lucy Mair; LMAIR@cesr.org; 718- 237-9145 

<p>For Immediate Release, December 2, 2000 


<p>After reviewing reports by independent groups including the Center for 
Economic and Social Rights (CESR), Habitat International, BADIL 
Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights, LAW and 
the Association of 40, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights declared that it was "deeply concerned by accounts 
that Israel’s recent actions in the occupied territories had resulted 
in the widespread and gross violations of Palestinians’ economic, 
social and cultural rights." 

<p>Furthermore, the Committee called for Israel to appear at its next 
session in May 2001 to discuss reported rights violations in the 
Occupied Territories (OT). The Committee’s decision follows recent 
condemnations of Israeli human rights violations throughout the UN 
system. The Security Council, Commission on Human Rights, Special 
Rapporteur to the OT and High Commissioner for Human Rights have all 
censured Israel for violations of humanitarian and human rights law 
during the current crisis. 

<p>In November 1998 the Committee rejected Israel’s claim that due to the 
Oslo peace process it is no longer responsible for human rights in the 
OT, and requested information on Israeli actions in the OT. Israel’s 
failure to do so in time for the recent session in Geneva led the 
Committee to note "that in light of the current crisis in Israel and 
the occupied territories, it was particularly unfortunate that Israel 
had not provided the additional information by the time requested." 

<p>The Committee expressed "grave concern" over the escalating pattern of 
Israeli violations reported by CESR and other groups, including: 

<p>- Israeli military and security forces both inside Israel and in the 
OT have prevented medical aid and personnel from reaching Palestinians 
and have attacked clearly marked medical vehicles and personnel in 
violation of international humanitarian law; 

<p>- Widespread restrictions have been imposed by Israeli authorities on 
the movement of persons and goods, including medicines, food and 
essential fuel; 

<p>- Palestinian children travelling to and from school have come under 
Israeli fire and many schools in the OT have been forced to close; The 
Israeli army has destroyed many acres of Palestinian agricultural land 
in the OT; 

<p>- Unemployment in the OT has tripled during the crisis, causing severe 
economic hardship, especially for the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups in the population; and 

<p>- The incidence of house demolition and land confiscation in the OT 
has increased, including the destruction of civilian homes through the 
use of heavy weapons. 

<p>Roger Normand, Executive Director of CESR says, "this shows that 
Israel’s economic warfare through closure, land confiscation and 
increasing settlements violates international law in the same way as 
Israel’s use of torture and excessive force. The Committee’s concern 
with these violations should be a signal to the entire international 
community to demand full Israeli respect for all human rights – a 
necessary pre-condition for any resumed peace talks."

<p><b>Day 64
Palestinian Man Shot and Killed by Israeli Forces While Working
December 2, 2000
</b></p>





<p>This morning, an eyewitness reported that Shihada el Jafari, 27,
from
Bitunia was shot and killed by Israeli forces while he was working
on
a construction site near the City Inn Hotel at the northern entrance
to Ramallah. Law is currently investigating this incident. Israeli
forces killed Jafari’s brother Ishmail during the “ Tunnel Incident”
in Jerusalem in 1996.

<p>In the village of Haris near Salfit, settlers protected by Israeli
forces cut down 25 olive and almond trees belonging to the family of
Auda Sultan. The property is situated between the village of Haris
and
the Barkan settlement. Since the beginnings of this crisis, Israeli
forces and settlers have cut down approximately 700 trees belong to
residents of Haris.

<p>In Nablus, an Israeli settler allegedly assaulted a Palestinian taxi
driver from the el Makhfiyi neighborhood. In an affidavit to LAW, Amer
Afuna, 34 stated that on November 29, 2000, at around 3:20p.m, his car
broke down near the Burin junction. When he got out of his car he
received a sharp blow to the back of his head and was taken by
ambulance Rafidia hospital. Afuna also said that he had left his
mobile phone and other personal belongings inside his car and when his
brother called the mobile, a man speaking Hebrew answered the phone
and told Afuna’s brother,  “we hit and killed him, if you want similar
treatment, we will be ready.”

<p>Israeli authorities re-opened the Gaza International Airport yesterday
and have given it permission to operate for six hours each day. Today,
Israeli forces bulldozed three meters of the airports southern wall.
According to Israeli officials, the wall was destroyed to allow
Israeli armored vehicles to pass through to the airport to inspect
passengers.

<p>Midhat Jad Allah, 17, from el Shat’i refugee camp in Gaza, died today
from a head wound sustained November 30, 2000 near the el Mintar
crossing.

<p>Yesterday evening, Yassin Shihada, 23, from Qalandia, died from a
gunshot wound sustained during clashes with Israeli forces near the
Jerusalem airport.

<p>Israeli forces opened fire with heavy machine guns on several
residential areas in Hebron last night, including Talit el Takruri,
Abu Sneineh, Wadi el Hiriyi, Dahyit el Zaitoun, and Bab el Zawwiyeh.
Two Palestinians, Lamya Deeb, 58, and Rawya Bader, 65, were wounded in
the attack.
