<p><b> The Massacre Continues: 139 martyrs and thousands wounded, and destruction 
  of property and land continues</b></p>
<p> For the 31st consecutive day the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continued 
  their aggression against the Palestinian civilians and their properties. The 
  Israeli Occupation Forces continued to use lethal and excessive force against 
  the Palestinian civilians leading to the killing of 139 Palestinians and injuring 
  more than 6500 others. Yesterday, 150 Palestinians were injured while 7 others 
  killed by the Israelis. The martyrs were: 
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Issmat Khaleel Assabir 29/10 34 Nablus Shot in the heart. 
  <li>Shadi Hasan Asholi 29/10 22 Assirah Ashamaliah/ Shot in the heart by live 
    ammunition. 
  <li> Sameer Mousa Hamid E'lewah 29/10 31 Gaza Shot in the chest by a 500-mm 
    bullet. 
  <li> Husni Husein Annajjar 29/10 14 Rafah Shot in the head by live ammunition. 
  <li> Fadi Ameen Mohammad Alhrous 29/10 22 Jenin Injured on 26/10/2000. 
  <li> Bilal Rashad Salahat 29/10 20 Ya'bad/ Jenin Shot in the head by a 500-mm 
    bullet. 
  <li> Hilal Rashad Salahat 29/10 20 Ya'bad/ Jenin Shot in the head by a 500-mm 
    bullet.
</ol>
<p> The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces shelled the houses located near 
  Salah Addeen gate in Rafah causing various degrees of damage to the houses owned 
  by Awad Barhoum, Abd Assalam Shaqfah, and Nassr Arrai'. 
<p> The Israelis continued to impose collective punishments upon the Palestinian 
  civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In this context, they continued to 
  close, either partially or completely, the roads leading to the Palestinian 
  population centers and to close the goods' and travelers' passages. Besides, 
  they continued to shell houses, clear agricultural lands, and damage irrigation 
  pumps and pools. 
<p>During the last night and this mourning, the Israelis have cleared agricultural 
  lands in Rafah. Israeli bulldozers, protected by Israeli tanks, have cleared 
  100 Donums owned by Abd Alkareem Dhhair, inheritors of Mezied Zaidan Dhhair, 
  Madhiouf Dhhair, and Nassir Dhhair. The claeared land contained greenhouses, 
  chicken coops, irrigation tubes, irrigation pumps and irrigation pools. Yesterday, 
  the occupation forces dug a 2-meter wide ditch across the road leading to (Almuntar/ 
  karni) passage to the east of Gaza city at a point close to the passage itself. 
  Through this passage, the Israelis deployed at least 15 tanks; which opened 
  fire at Palestinian civilians and shelled a Palestinian (National Security Force) 
  base located nearby the passage. Other Israeli tanks preserved their locations 
  alongside Salah Addin road that connects the two halves of Gaza Strip and continued 
  blocking the road located next to Kisofeem Jewish settlement. 
<p> AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights emphasizes that the Occupation Forces are 
  committing war crimes against the Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Territories. 
  The Israeli attacks against the Palestinians are evident grave breaches to the 
  humanitarian international law and the 4th Geneva Convention. These breaches 
  are being systematically escalated by the Israelis which threatens the lives 
  and properties of the Palestinian civilians. In the light of this, AL-MEZAN 
  requests the international community, especially the high contracting parties 
  to the 4th Geneva Convention to immediately intervene to stop the massacres 
  committed by the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces against the Palestinian 
  civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The international community is requested 
  also to provide international protection for the Palestinian civilians in the 
  West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moreover, AL-MEZAN demands that the High commissioner 
  for Human Rights to immediately visit the Occupied Territories in order to witness 
  the truth, the Israeli anti-humanitarian crimes.

<h3> <a name="parc"></a> </h3>
<h3>Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees</h3>
<p>We in PARC view with great concern the continued nasty crimes committed against 
  unarmed Palestinian civilians and their properties by the Israeli occupation 
  forces. 
<p>Many Projects implemented by Palestinian non-governmental organizations and 
  international partners were and are still exposed to aggressive operations by 
  the Israeli settlers and military forces. The last attack was demolishing two 
  cisterns for collecting rain waters with the capacity of 450 cubic meters. These 
  collecting pools belonged to Muhhamad Musalem Dhair and to I'zat Jumma'h Dhair. 
  They were constructed by PARC three years ago, south of Khan Yunes in Gaza Strip, 
  nearby the Murag settlement. The reservoir that belongs to the farmer Muhhamed 
  Dhair is NOW used as a military trench for Israeli tanks, while the whole area 
  is declared as a military zone. 
<p>This happened after the Israeli forces destroyed 5 dunums cultivated by pepper 
  and another dunum cultivated by beans as well as they uprooted 15 olive trees 
  owned by the aforementioned farmers. 
<p>PARC strongly condemns these atrocities and calls upon all its partners and 
  friends for stopping the barbarous killings and the random acts of economic 
  destruction, which the Palestinian People are being subjected to around the 
  clock.

<h3> <a name="ymca"></a> </h3>
<h3>YMCA Beit Sahour</h3>
<p>The YMCA in Beit Sahour was subject to an unprecedented attack by the Israeli 
  Occupation forces. Israeli Helicopters and forces in the "Osh Al-ghurab" military 
  camp near Beit Sahour joined in the attack. 
<p>Bombing and shooting started from around 5:00 PM on Friday 27 October 2000 
  until 2:30 AM on Saturday 28 October 2000. The neighboring houses were also 
  subject to direct hits, which caused severe damages and terrorized its residents 
  especially the children. 
<p>The assault resulted in damages to all the YMCA facilities by many bombs and 
  a massive number of bullets of all descriptions and sizes. The administration 
  offices, the training hall, the men and women dormitories, the special bus for 
  transporting the physically challenged, the "Play Therapy" room, developed especially 
  to ease the psychological stress from the children who are victims of violence, 
  the vocational training department and even the facilities that serve the Shepherds 
  field visitors were exposed to direct hits. 
<p>The Young Men Christian Association being an association that provides humanistic 
  services to the physically challenged, to the victims of political violence 
  and to the marginalized sector of the Palestinian people, questions the meaning 
  of this assault on our premises and the wisdom behind it, we declare that this 
  assault shall further enhance our commitment and adherence to the destiny and 
  the just cause of our Palestinian people. We deem the assault as a fierce attack 
  on all International declarations, resolutions and practices. The assault is 
  a clear violation of human rights and specifically to the Geneva Convention 
  in relation to protection of civilians under occupation. 
<p>We appeal to all bodies concerned about peace and security to all people to 
  support our efforts in order to: 
<p>1- Immediately stop the Israeli acts of violence on Palestinian civilians and 
  institutions. 
<p>2- Immediate interference to protect the Palestinian People through a mechanism 
  that also ensures that the Israeli Forces shall not practice this loose application 
  of force by bombing and shooting which reached an illogical irrational, unprecedented 
  level, far beyond any imagination. 
<p>3- To hold the Israeli government and the Israeli Prime Minister personally 
  responsible for the crimes that are committed against our Palestinian civilians.

<p><a name="phr"></a>PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS-ISRAEL</p>
<p><b>Severe conclusions from the analysis of the injuries sustained by Palestinian 
  citizens of Israel during the October confrontations within the 'Green Line' 
  </b></p>
<br>
<br>
Official data from 'Rambam' hospital in Haifa - the main hospital in the north 
of Israel - regarding Arab citizens of Israel admitted to the hospital during 
the October confrontations in the north of Israel, were analyzed by PHR-Israel 
expert Dr. Zeev Wiener: <br>
<br>
According to Dr. Wiener, it is surprising that so many of the injuries are in 
the upper part of the body. Bullets were extracted from the bodies of the injured, 
apparently indicating direct fire, rather than injuries from ricochets. <br>
<br>
32 injured civilians were admitted to the emergency room. 4 were discharged and 
we have no further information regarding their condition. 28 were hospitalized, 
with 30 injuries (two had more than one injury). 2 died of their injuries. <br>
<br>
Of those admitted, there were:<br>
10 head or face injuries<br>
11 chest injuries<br>
9 arm/leg injuries <br>
<br>
Despite the fact that these data are partial, and somewhat biased, since only 
the most serious injuries were sent to Rambam hospital - the large number of seriously 
injured and the severity of the injuries suffice to arouse suspicion, that in 
many cases there was massive shooting directed toward civilians, and that possibly 
sniper fire was employed - rather than warning fire intended to scatter the demonstrations. 
<br>
<br>
These data correspond to testimonies given by several of the injured to PHR-Israel, 
according to which sniper fire was employed against demonstrators. <br>
<br>
In light of the above, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel has sent a message to 
the Minister of Internal Security, Prof. Shlomo Ben-Ami, in which we demand to 
know: 1. What were the firing instructions given to Israeli Police and Border 
Police forces, and did the forces act according to these regulations? 2. Was sniper 
fire employed? If so, we demand to know why sniper fire was employed against demonstrating 
civilians, who are citizens of Israel.

PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS-ISRAEL condemns an attack by Israeli civilians directed 
against a Palestinian hospital, and demands that the Prime Minister publicly call 
for respect of medical institutions and human life. <br>
<br>
This morning at 5:30 am a GMC vehicle stopped opposite the gate of 'Augusta Victoria' 
Hospital in East Jerusalem. One of its three passengers, identified as Jewish 
by their clothes, got out of the vehicle, directed a gun at the entrance to the 
hospital, and shot two gunshots at the hospital guard. <br>
<br>
PHR-Israel has issued a message to the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, demanding 
that he and his government publicly call to civilians and military forces alike 
in Israel, to protect the neutrality of medical personnel and institutions, especially 
at times of tension and conflict, when basic human principles must be observed. 
<br>
<br>
We are aware that a police investigation has commenced regarding this event, but 
in our opinion this is not sufficient. In order to ensure that such a case does 
not repeat itself, there is need of an unequivocal message from the Israeli government 
condemning such conduct and protecting medical institutions and human life itself. 
<br>
<br>
If even medical institutions are damaged today, what moral values can remain?

<p><b>U.S. Citizens in Palestine Voice Their Concerns<br>
  Why is our government supporting brutal occupation? </b></p>
<p>October 30 –In a press conference held today in Ramallah, approximately 100 
  U.S. citizens gathered at the Friends Boys School to express their deep concern 
  over the continuing carnage in Palestine and the failure of the U.S. government 
  to take a just stance in the Israel/Palestinian conflict. The group called on 
  the United States to live up to its role as an “honest broker” in peace efforts 
  and to uphold the principles of justice, liberty and human rights that America 
  stands for. 
<p>Among the concerns that were raised by the participants at the press conference 
  include: the terrorization of Palestinian civilians and disregard for human 
  rights by the Israeli military, the lack of balance in U.S actions and statements, 
  and America’s role in supporting the military occupation without insisting on 
  compliance with international law governing occupation. Also brought to light 
  was the failure of the U.S. Consulate to be responsive to the needs of Arab 
  Americans living in the occupied territories. One woman related that her son, 
  a U.S. citizen visiting in Palestine, was arrested and tortured by Israeli forces 
  on his way to the neighborhood grocery store. “He has been held for over a month 
  now without charge.” Palestinian American school children sent a message to 
  their peers in the U.S., “while you’re going to parties and preparing for homecoming, 
  we’re hiding from missiles and bullets,” said Saed Atshan. Media bias and general 
  mischaracterization of the conflict and the current crises were also mentioned. 
<p>“It is wrong for the United States to support continued military occupation 
  and the use of brutal force by Israel against Palestinian civilians. We call 
  on our government to take decisive steps towards ensuring compliance with international 
  and humanitarian law and to play a vital role in bringing an immediate end to 
  Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian people” said spokesman Mohammad Abdrabbo. 
<p>Americans Abroad Concerned Over U.S. Role in Israel/Palestinian Conflict October 
  30, 2000 
<p>We are U.S. citizens, living in occupied Jerusalem, West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
  outraged over the continuing carnage in Palestine, which so far has resulted 
  in the death of at least 130 Palestinians, 4 Palestinian security officers, 
  one Israeli civilian, and 6 Israeli soldiers. No less than 6000 Palestinian 
  civilians lie injured. 30% of the Palestinian casualties are children 18 years 
  of age and under. 
<p>We deplore the failure of our government to condemn the use of lethal weaponry, 
  including missiles, helicopter gunships, rubber- coated steel bullets, live 
  ammunition, heavy machine gunfire, exploding dum-dum bullets, and linked 40mm 
  grenade launchers by Israeli troops, against Palestinian civilians. Many of 
  us have watched as American-made attack helicopters have been used to bomb Palestinian 
  residential areas, including in our own neighborhoods. 
<p>We condemn the unilateral actions and statements of our Administration, Congress 
  and candidates for public office, which contradict the U.S. government’s position 
  as an “honest broker” in peace efforts. We specifically denounce the U.S. Congress’ 
  passage of Resolution 426, placing the blame for the current violence entirely 
  on the Palestinian leadership, and the U.S. Administration’s plans to push for 
  additional military aid to Israel. 
<p>We regret our government’s decision to close its embassies in the Arab world. 
  We are concerned about the growing alienation on the popular level in the Arab 
  world due to the perception of lack of balance in U.S, policy. 
<p>We call on the Administration to immediately implement the following: 
<p>1.Protection for Palestinian Civilians: Take the lead in providing international 
  protection for Palestinian civilians, particularly in the areas of conflict 
  and flash points. 
<p>2.International Inquiry: Support the demand for an immediate international 
  inquiry into the root causes of the conflict, as called for in UN Resolution 
  1322, and support the immediate implementation of the resolution. 
<p>3.Humanitarian Assistance: Help ensure that international emergency aid, including 
  medical supplies and foodstuffs, reach the Palestinian people. 
<p>4.Palestinian Rights: Reaffirm and strengthen President Clinton’s statement 
  in Gaza supporting Palestinian inalienable rights for self- determination in 
  the same manner that he has recently supported the Kosovar people in their fight 
  for freedom. 
<p>5.Arms Shipments: Suspend arms shipments to Israel in light of the use of U.S. 
  supplied weapons against Palestinian civilians, a violation of the U.S. Arms 
  Export Control Act. 
<p>6.Foreign Aid: Halt the transfer of U.S. taxpayer money to Israel, currently 
  in the amount of 6 billion dollars per year, for as long as Israel remains in 
  violation of UN Resolutions and international law. 
<p>We are currently witnessing some of the worst violence this region has ever 
  seen. Our homes and businesses are being attacked by the Israeli military on 
  a daily basis. Our children live in terror as a result of these on-going attacks 
  The United States has the power to facilitate an immediate end to the illegal 
  Israeli occupation. Too many US tax dollars, too many lives, too much injustice 
  to the Palestinian people, and too much suffering and waste should make the 
  events of the last one month the final wake up call. The time has come for the 
  United States to place itself on the right side of history in this 50+ year 
  conflict. We expect our government to stand up for the justice, liberty and 
  human rights that America stands for.

<p><b>Clashes continue in the occupied Palestinian territories: More than 154 
  donums of land are swept in the Gaza Strip </b></p>
<p>For the 32nd consecutive day, the Israeli occupation forces have continued 
  to shoot at Palestinian civilians demonstrating in protest to the serious abuses 
  and killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces throughout the occupied 
  Palestinian territories. The Israeli occupation forces have continued to reinforce 
  their presence with more troops and armored vehicles on roads between Palestinian 
  cities, at the entrances of these cities and at points of contact between areas 
  under the control of the Palestinian National Authority and areas under the 
  control of the Israeli occupation forces. In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation 
  forces' bulldozers swept more agricultural and wooded land during the past 24 
  hours. They have swept 1001- donums of land in the Gaza Strip since September 
  29, 2000. The number of Palestinians who have been killed since September 29, 
  2000 has increased to 134. In addition, more than 4,000 Palestinians have been 
  wounded, some of whom are in critical condition. 
<p>In Rafah, clashes have broken out since the morning between Palestinian demonstrators 
  and the Israeli occupation forces near Salah El-Din Gate on the Palestinian-Egyptian 
  border, and near Tal Al-Sultan roadblock in the west of the town (separating 
  it from Al-Mawasi). The Israeli occupation forces fired live ammunition and 
  rockets at Palestinian demonstrators near Salah El-Din Gate and wounded 20 of 
  them with live ammunition, including 12-year-old child Muna Abdullah Hamad who 
  was hit with a splinter of a rocket in her eye. PCHR's field officer in Rafah 
  reported that she was away from the area of clashes. At about 16:30 local time, 
  the Israeli occupation forces shot at an ambulance of the Palestinian Red Crescent 
  Society on its way to evacuate one of the wounded near Salah El-Din Gate and 
  no injuries were reported. 
<p>Yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces fired rockets at Palestinian 
  houses near Salah El-Din Gate in Rafah causing severe damage. PCHR's field officer 
  reported that one rocket hit a house owned by Abdel-Salam Hassan Shaqfa, a second 
  one hit a house owned by Naser El-Rae'I and a third one hit a commercial store 
  owned by Awadh Barhoum. PCHR's field officer in the area reported that damage 
  was limited to properties and no injuries among civilians were recorded. 
<p>Since yesterday evening until this afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces' 
  bulldozers swept large areas of agricultural land in Rafah near Morag settlement 
  and near the Palestinian-Egyptian borders. They swept a 58-donum area of agricultural 
  land to the southwest of Morag settlement owned by farmers of Dhoheir family. 
  PCHR's field officer in Rafah reported that dozens of greenhouses, two farms 
  of poultry and some guava trees were swept. The Israeli occupation forces demolished 
  a 180-square meter house established on part of the land and owned by the Dhoheir 
  family. Residents of the house were forcibly expelled from the house without 
  being able to evacuate their furniture. The family estimated the loss at hundreds 
  of thousands of dollars. 
<p>This afternoon, in Al-Salam neighborhood in the southeast of Rafah, the Israeli 
  occupation forces' bulldozers swept a strip of agricultural land adjacent to 
  the Palestinian Egyptian borders 2km long and 30-50m wide planted with olives 
  and almonds. The area of swept land is estimated at 80 donums and owned by the 
  families of Qeshta, Al-Nahhal and Bahloul. The Israeli occupation forces swept 
  also a three-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives and destroyed 
  two water reservoirs and a room established on the land. The swept land is in 
  the southwest of Al-Salam neighborhood and owned by the Al-Shae'r family. In 
  the same area, the Israeli occupation forces fired at two houses owned by Samir 
  Abu El-Soud and Mohammed El-A'yyad, but no injuries were reported. The Israeli 
  occupation forces have continued to reinforce their presence in the area with 
  more troops and armored vehicles which portends more abuses against Palestinian 
  civilians in Rafah. 
<p>Clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation 
  forces near Karni Outlet on a road between Netzarim junction and Karni Outlet 
  used by Jewish settlers. PCHR's field officer in the area reported that the 
  Israeli occupation forces fired live ammunition at Palestinian demonstrators 
  and wounded 14 of them, six of whom are in critical condition. They are: 
<p>1. Alla' Mahmoud El-Jaro, 23 years old, from Gaza City, wounded with a live 
  bullet in the head, 
<p>2. Mohammed Rezeq El-Sersawi, 19 years old, from Gaza City, wounded with a 
  live bullet in the back which reached the chest, 
<p>3. Oleyan Faraj El-Khawar, 27 years old, from Gaza City, wounded with a live 
  bullet in the chest, 
<p>4. A'atef Suleiman El-Sousi, 25 years old, from Gaza City, wounded with a live 
  bullet in the back, 
<p>5. A'ayesh Nae'im Abu Ghaben, 16 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the 
  chest, and 
<p>6. Unidentified, wounded with a live bullet in the abdomen and liver. 
<p>Yesterday, the Israeli occupation forces swept a three-donum area of agricultural 
  land planted with olives to the south of Karni Outlet and owned by the Al-Haj 
  family. The Israeli occupation forces continued to close Salah El-Din Street, 
  the main road between the north of the Gaza Strip and its south, at Netzarim 
  junction and Karni Outlet. Only Jewish settlers are allowed to use this road. 
<p>In Khan Yunis, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and the 
  Israeli occupation forces near an Israeli military post to the west of the refugee 
  camp of Khan Yunis and near Al-Tuffah roadblock between Khan Yunis city and 
  Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area. The Israeli occupation forces opened fire on 
  Palestinian demonstrators wounding 15 civilians with live ammunition and five 
  with rubber-coated metal bullets. PCHR's field officer in Khan Yunis reported 
  that five of the wounded are in critical condition. They are: 
<p>1. Muhammed Ahmed El-Sheikh Dheeb, 24 years old, wounded with a dum-dum bullet 
  in the head and evacuated to Shifa' hospital in Gaza, 
<p>2. Saleh Mahmoud Al-Najjar, 14 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the 
  chest, 
<p>3. Mohammed Zou'rob, 19 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the mouth, 
<p>4. Eyad Abu Jame'e, 18 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the chest, 
  and 
<p>5. Naji Wasfi Barbakh, 18 years old, wounded with a bullet in the abdomen. 
<p>Also in Khan Yunis, PCHR's field officer reported that the Israeli occupation 
  forces swept a ten-donum area of land at the entrance of a road leading from 
  Salah El-Din Street to Kissufim crossing. The swept tract of land is owned by 
  Khalaf Abu Hajjaj. 
<p>In the vicinity of Kfar Darom settlement near Deir El-Balah, clashes broke 
  out this afternoon between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation 
  forces. These forces opened fire and wounded three Palestinian civilians with 
  live ammunition. 
<p>PCHR learned that similar clashes broke out in several areas of the West Bank, 
  especially in Tulkarm, Hebron and Ramallah. The Israeli occupation forces fired 
  at Palestinian demonstrators and wounded 30 of them with live ammunition. Yesterday 
  evening, the Israeli occupation forces fired at Palestinian demonstrators in 
  the town of Ya'bad near Jenin and killed brothers Bilal Rashad Salahat, 22 years 
  old, and Hilal Rashad Salahat, 18 yeas old, with live bullets in the head. 
<p>PCHR's Notes on Today's Clashes in the Gaza Strip: 
<p>1. There is a significant escalation of shooting at Palestinian demonstrators 
  by the Israeli occupation forces with the aim to kill. Today, 52 Palestinian 
  civilians were wounded with live ammunition, including dum-dum bullets, five 
  with rubber-coated metal bullets and a child with a splinter of a rocket. 
<p>2. Eleven of the wounded are in critical condition as they were wounded in 
  the head, chest, back and abdomen. Four of these are children between 14 and 
  18 years of age. 
<p>3. Two of the wounded received a bullet in the back. This provides evidence 
  of indiscriminate shooting or targeting with the aim to kill. 
<p>4. Rockets were used against residential buildings. 
<p>5. A 154-dunum area of agricultural land was swept and agricultural facilities 
  and a house were destroyed. 
<p>6. The Israeli occupation forces reinforced their presence and restricted movement 
  of people and means of transportation by closing roads.

<p><b>Special Report: The Emerging Trends<br>
  Statistical Picture of Palestinian Deaths and Injuries </b></p>
<p>Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi, president of the UPMRC held a press conference today 
  at the Ambassador Hotel in East Jerusalem. The purpose of the press conference 
  was to dispel myths and present factual evidence that directly contradicts IDF 
  statements about the current conflict. 
<p>To date, 144 Palestinians have been killed and approximately 5,000 have been 
  injured as a result of Israeli actions. 
<p>One myth that has surfaced recently is that Palestinians are using their children 
  as shields in clashes and purposefully sending them out to demonstrate. However, 
  the statistics prove otherwise. While a disturbing number of children have been 
  killed, the majority have been adults. Palestinian deaths according to age are: 
  · 13.8% below the age of 15 · 20.3% age 16-18 · 50% age 19-29 · 8.7% age 30-39 
  · 3.6% age 40-49 · 3.6% 50-59 
<p>Many of the children who were killed were not involved in clashes. For example, 
  13-year-old Muayyad Usma Jawarish was shot and killed by Israeli sniper fire 
  in Bethlehem. He was on his way home from school and was not within a clash 
  area. Similarly, 18-month-old Sara Abdul Azeem was shot in the head by a settler. 
  She was returning home with her father and was not near a clash site. A six-month-old 
  infant was also killed. 
<p>The reality is that the IDF is attacking unarmed Palestinian civilians with 
  deadly accuracy, creating a situation Dr. Barghouthi describes as "warfare without 
  a war." 
<p>Major causes of Palestinian deaths are: · Bullets - 92% · Tear gas - 1.4% · 
  Torture - 1.4% · Prevented access to medical treatment due to the closure - 
  2.2% 
<p>The locations of wounds which caused the deaths: · 48.1% in the head and neck 
  · 50.4% in the chest and abdomen · 1.6% in the lower limbs 
<p>Injury statistics are telling as well. Locations of injuries have been: · 26% 
  in the head or neck · 70% to the upper body · 58% to the upper body if injuries 
  to the upper limbs are excluded 
<p>These figures show that, counter to IDF claims, the Israeli army is shooting 
  to kill unarmed Palestinians. Other groups like the United States chapter of 
  Physicians for Human Rights agree with this assessment. Ninety-five to ninety-eight 
  percent of the clashes occur between Palestinians armed only with stones, and 
  Israeli soldiers armed with rubber-coated metal bullets, tear gas, live ammunition, 
  tanks, helicopters, and 50 caliber bullets. The IDF claims that soldiers are 
  acting in self-defense, but the numbers show that many Palestinians have been 
  shot in the head, some in the back of the head while trying to run from the 
  soldiers' fire. Snipers have also been used to assassinate Palestinians, an 
  act that is not consistent with the 'self-defense' argument. Dr. Barghouthi 
  explains that Israel is escalating the status of the situation from an occupation 
  to a one-sided armed conflict in an attempt to justify the suppression of Palestinians 
  and exempt the army from any accountability. 
<p>Israeli attacks have harmed a substantial proportion of the Palestinian population. 
  If the same proportion of civilians in the US were killed and injured, approximately 
  433,000 Americans would be injured and 7,500 would be dead. 
<p>The UPMRC repeats its appeal for international protection for Palestinian civilians 
  from Israeli attacks.

<p><b>ISRAEL REFUSES DYING MAN PERMISSION TO SEE FAMILY </b></p>
<p>Today, 30 October 2000, Israeli forces delayed a Palestinian Red Crescent Ambulance 
  for 3 hours on its way to collect a terminally ill patient. The patient and 
  his family had hoped to see each other before he died, but had been prevented 
  by delays at the Israeli checkpoint. 
<p>A terminally ill cancer patient, Riya Awad, 26 years old from Yatta, near Hebron, 
  had hoped to see his family before he died. He had arranged for the ambulance 
  to collect him from the bridge between the West Bank and Jordan to take him 
  to see his family. The ambulance was delayed for three hours between 9.30am 
  and 12.30pm, this morning. Awad died at the bridge without seeing his family. 
<p>At 9.30 am Israel soldiers refused to allow the ambulance to pass the checkpoint 
  and instructed its driver to turn back after holding it there for more than 
  an hour. At 10.40am, the ambulance sought alternative routes but was successively 
  turned back; only after a 40-minutes discussion with Israeli command did the 
  ambulance succeeding in securing passage. 
<p>LAW deplores the Israeli closure of the occupied Palestinian territory. Closure 
  is a collective punishment, violating article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
  which prohibits all forms action intended to intimidate or terrorise an occupied 
  population. This case indicates that the closure is being applied without respect 
  for basic and is intended increase the suffering of Palestinians.
