<b>Another Death Sentence Issued By The PNA State Security
Court  </b>
<p>Yesterday evening, 11 January 2001, the State Security Court in
Rafah
in the Gaza Strip sentenced Majdi Muhammad Ahmad Makawi (27)
to death
by firing squad. He was found guilty of collaborating with Israel and
endangering national security.  The defendant was tried in a court
which does not meet minimum standards for fair trial. The sentence
was
based on articles 77 and 88a of Order Number 555 of 1957
(Egyptian
legislation for the Gaza Strip).
<p>
The Court was headed by Colonel Abd’al Aziz Wadi with the
assistance
of military judge Colonel Muhammad Farhat and Major Jamil Abu
Kashif.<p>
The prosecution charged the defendant with collaborating with Israel,
endangering State Security for the sake of foreign parties, breaking
the people’s will in opposing the Israeli occupation and causing the
deaths of four Palestinians fighting the occupation during the current
Intifada, namely Awni Ismail, Sami Abu Laban, Nael Alidawi and Jamal
Abed al Razeq, a well-known Fatah leader and a relative. All four men
were killed on 22 November 2000 when Israeli soldiers stationed at the
entrance of the Morag settlement in the Gaza Strip opened fire at
their cars (see LAW press release of 22 November 2000). Makawi was
charged with helping the Israeli security forces kill the four men.
<p>
The State Security Court was established in 1995 as a special court
with jurisdiction over security offences. As such, it functions
outside the Palestinian civil court system in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip. The State Security Court provides no right of appeal and
thus operates in contravention of international fair trial standards.
Sentences issued by the State Security Court, including life
imprisonment and death penalties, are only subject to ratification by
the President of the Palestinian National Authority.
<p>
LAW condemns acts of collaboration with Israel causing harm to the
Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation. However, LAW
demands that individuals suspected of acts of collaboration be tried
according to internationally recognized fair trial standards and
opposes the death penalty as the ultimate violation of the right to
life.
<p>
Since February 1995 Palestinian courts have issued 33 death sentences,
13 of which have been issued by the State Security Court.  To date
three people have been executed in the PNA after grossly unfair
trials.
<p>
LAW urges President Arafat not to ratify any of the death sentences
issued by Palestinian courts.
<p>
LAW calls for the abolition of the State Security Court and the
prohibition of the death penalty in the PNA.
<p>
LAW calls on President Arafat to order a retrial for Majdi Muhammad
Ahmad Makawi before a court operating in accordance with international
fair trial standards.
