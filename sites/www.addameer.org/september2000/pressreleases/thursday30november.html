MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT THABO  MBEKI,  CHAIR  OF  THE  NON- 
ALIGNED MOVEMENT, ON THE OCCASION OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
DAY OF  SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, 29 NOVEMBER 
2000  </b></p>
<p>

  

<p>(Read out by Ambassador Kumalo at the United Nations in New York)  

<p>On behalf of the people  of  South  Africa  and  the  Non-Aligned 
Movement, I extend warm greetings  to  all  Palestinians  on  the 
occasion  of  the  International  Day  of  Solidarity  with   the 
Palestinian people, whether in Palestine or in the Diaspora.  

<p>Allow me first  of  all  to  convey  the  Non-Aligned  Movement's 
deepest sympathy and condolences to the families and  friends  of 
victims of the ongoing attacks of the Israeli security forces  on 
Palestinians. We decry the excessive and disproportionate use  of 
force by the Israeli army.  

<p>At this occasion last year, we were filled with hope for a future 
which appeared so promising  because  of  the  truly  encouraging 
developments and the positive steps that had been taken  to  move the 
peace process forward. It is therefore with sadness  that  we have to 
commemorate this important day  this  year  amid  violent conflict, a 
situation far removed from our visions of last year.  

<p>As Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, I  wish  to  reiterate  our 
common conviction  that  just  and  lasting  peace  can  only  be 
achieved through peaceful negotiations. We believe that the first 
priority on the road towards that aim should be the cessation  of 
violence. This can be achieved through concrete  steps.  Firstly, it 
is of the highest importance that  Israeli  troops  should  be 
withdrawn at least to the positions that they occupied before  28 
September, the day of Mr Ariel Sharon's fateful  and  provocative 
visit to the Haram al-Sharif.  

<p>Furthermore,  the  illegal  measures  of  collective   punishment 
against the Palestinian people, such as the total blockade of the 
Palestinian  territories  and  the  economic  embargo  placed  on 
Palestine, should be ended forthwith. We note that, following the 2 
November understanding reached  between  President  Arafat  and former 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres,  President  Arafat  has  made several 
calls for calm while Prime Minister Barak  did  not  give effect to 
that  agreement,  because  of  the  explosion  in  West Jerusalem the 
next day. Only when these conditions have been met, can it 
realistically be expected that  President  Arafat's  calls for calm 
will be heeded.  

<p>The international community can make a meaningful contribution to the 
restoration of calm and the rebuilding of the trust that  has been 
shattered in the past  two  months.  I  want  to  take  this 
opportunity to renew our call for the  immediate  stationing,  in the  
occupied  Palestinian  territories,  of   an   international observer 
force under the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations.  As Israel has no 
legitimate jurisdiction in the occupied Palestinian territories, the 
South African Government does not understand why Israel should be 
allowed to exercise a veto over  the  deployment of such a force.  

<p>It is of the greatest importance  and  urgency  that  good  faith 
negotiations between Palestine and  Israel  should  resume,  once calm 
has returned to the region. It has  become  clear  that  the Oslo 
Process, which has carried on  for  more  than  seven  years prior to 
the recent outbreak of violence, has  had  major  flaws. These relate 
directly to the manner in which Palestinians on  the street experience 
the results of the peace process. Although  the Oslo Process has 
brought a  visible  improvement  in  inter  alia Palestinian 
infrastructure, by and large it has  brought  a  much more  
intrusive   Israeli   security   presence   into   ordinary 
Palestinian lives by the need to cross  interminable  checkpoints that 
have sprung up around every Palestinian urban  centre.  This could be 
offset in the  past  when  there  was  progress  in  the negotiations 
and the implementation of agreements. However,  this has all dried up 
and there is no tangible evidence for anyone  in the Palestinian 
streets of a peace dividend any longer. Now there is just the daily 
humiliation of enduring Israeli roadblocks  and the interminable 
arrogance and provocation of Israeli settlers in Palestine.  

<p>It therefore seems improbable that the Oslo Process can simply be 
resumed  without  considerable  amendment.  The   South   African 
Government believes that the United Nations, as the  organisation 
entrusted with the safeguarding and  promotion  of  world  peace, 
should play a central role in future negotiations,  whatever  the 
context or formula for a resumed  peace  process.  Major  players such 
as the European states, various Middle Eastern  states,  and others 
can also make a meaningful contribution to building  peace and should 
be allowed to play a role.  

<p>To a considerable degree, future negotiations should be about the 
modalities for the implementation of the  existing  international 
consensus enshrined in UN Security Council  Resolutions  242  and 338 
which call for Israeli withdrawal from the  Arab  territories occupied 
since the  1967  war.  The  Security  Council  has  also recognised  
the  principle  of  the  self- determination  of   the Palestinian  
people  and  has,  conversely,  provided  for   Arab recognition of  
the  right  of  Israel  to  exist  within  secure borders. "Land for 
peace" is the only viable option.  

<p>To all our Palestinian brothers and sisters, I wish to  reiterate that 
their struggle is for a legitimate cause. In September  this year the 
Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement reaffirmed the 
Movement's traditional and long-standing solidarity with  the 
Palestinian people and its support for the implementation of  all UN 
resolutions on the question of Palestine, in their declaration in the 
context of the Millennium Assembly.  

<p>Allow me, therefore, on behalf of the  Non-Aligned  Movement  and 
particularly on behalf  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  to 
reiterate our  commitment  to  invigorate  our  support  for  and 
solidarity with your legitimate struggle for freedom and equality as a 
sovereign member of the family of nations. In effect, it  is an 
affront to all humanity that, while we are  dealing  with  the 
challenges  of  and  aspirations  for  the  new  millennium,  our 
Palestinian brothers and sisters are still  hankering  for  their 
basic human rights and, as a nation, for the realisation of their 
right to self- determination. It is inexcusable  that,  more  than 
fifty years after  the  United  Nations  affirmed  the  right  of 
Palestinians to sovereign statehood and more  than  thirty  years 
after the United Nations Security Council, in a binding decision, 
called on Israel to withdraw from all the Arab  territories  that it 
had occupied in the  war  of  June  1967,  the  suffering  and 
humiliation of foreign military occupation still continue.  

<p>I thank you.

BADIL BULLETIN, No. 3: 
"REVISITING the PARTITION PLAN (UNGA 181) - Lessons Learned or 
Mistakes Repeated? The United Nations and Palestine"  </b></p>



<p>On the 22nd anniversary of the International Day of Solidarity with 
the Palestinian People, and more than five decades after the United 
Nations first addressed the issue of Palestinian rights, it is 
appropriate to revisit the discussions, debates, and proposals of 1947 
and 1948 that led to the adoption of UNGA Resolution 181 (II), the 
partition of Palestine, and provided the legal basis for the 
establishment of Israel. An examination of the lessons to be learned 
from the UN's first attempt to deal with the so-called question of 
Palestine is particularly relevant at the current time with renewed, 
albeit limited, involvement of the United Nations after the collapse 
of the Madrid/Oslo process and Israel's brutal repression of 
legitimate Palestinian resistance to the occupation, a policy which 
has cost the lives of nearly 300 Palestinians, more than 10,000 
injuries, and massive destruction of Palestinian private and public 
property in less than three months. 

<p>DID YOU KNOW THAT the UN General Assembly rejected repeated proposals 
by Arab states in 1947 to obtain an advisory opinion from the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) about whether the United Nations 
was authorized to partition a country on the grounds that raising 
matters of principle would not assist in the process of bringing the 
parties together to reach a solution? DID YOU KNOW THAT the partition 
of Palestine was approved by the UN General Assembly on 29 November 
1947 regardless of the question of whether or not the General Assembly 
had the legal authority to recommend and enforce the partition of 
Palestine? DID YOU KNOW THAT by 1948 the United States had doubts 
about the legality and feasibility of the UN Partition Plan and 
proposed a Temporary Trusteeship in Palestine under Chapter XII of the 
UN Charter? 

<p>There are at least two primary lessons to be drawn from the UN 
experience of dealing with Palestine in 1947 and 1948 that remain 
relevant today. First, a peaceful solution and just resolution of the 
historical Israeli-Palestinian/Arab conflict must be consistent with 
the principles of the UN Charter and international law. Secondly, the 
international community must be fully engaged in the implementation of 
a just and durable solution, including the deployment of international 
forces to monitor and facilitate the period of transition and 
implementation in order to ensure respect for international law. 
Unfortunately, the response of the international community to date is 
one that still falls largely in the category of mistakes repeated 
rather than lessons learned. Issues of international legality continue 
to be set aside based on claims that the latter might obstruct 
bilateral, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and powerful member 
states of the United Nations, especially the United States and Europe, 
and the UN Secretary General himself, have so far refused to deploy UN 
forces in the Israeli occupied Palestinian territories. The question 
remains as to how much more education and awareness- raising is 
required, let alone the loss of human life, before the international 
community will act to implement the fundamental rights of the 
Palestinian people, as recognized in more than fifty years of UN 
resolutions and statements.

Israeli occupation forces open fire on a secondary school in Hebron: 
One student killed and another 10 wounded; Israeli settler uses his 
car to kill a Palestinian child; A Palestinian child in Gaza dies from 
a previous wound; Palestinian civilians resist land sweeping: Israeli 
occupation forces fire on them 
 </b></p>


<p>With the Palestinian Intifada entering its third month, the Israeli 
occupation forces escalated their aggression against Palestinian 
civilians. This morning, these forces shot at students of Taqqou’ 
secondary school in Hebron, killing one student with a live bullet in 
the heart, and wounding another 10, two of whom were seriously 
wounded. Near Al-Mentar (Karni) Crossing, to the east of Gaza City, 
two children were wounded with live bullets in the head. This 
morning, in the village of Housan in Bethlehem, a settler 
intentionally killed a child by hitting him with his car. Yesterday 
evening, a child from Gaza died from a previous wound caused by a live 
bullet in the head on November 26, 2000. In the meantime, the Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to sweep agricultural land and to 
demolish civilian facilities throughout the Gaza Strip. 

<p>1. Shooting at Palestinian Civilians 

<p>This morning, at about 11:00 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
opened fire on Taqqou’ secondary school in the village of Taqqou’ in 
Hebron. As a result, the student Walid Mohammed Ahmed Hassan El-Badan, 
17 years old, was killed with a live bullet in the heart. 
Additionally, another 10 students were wounded with live bullets, two 
of whom were seriously wounded. They are: 1) Ibrahim Nawawra, 17 
years, wounded with a live bullet in the abdomen; and 2) Fathi Azziz 
El-Badan, 17 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the abdomen and 
another one in the left arm. PCHR learned that clashes between 
Palestinian civilians and the Israeli occupation forces broke out near 
the school. The Israeli occupation forces opened fire 
indiscriminately, killing El-Badan and wounding his colleagues, when 
they were near the school. In addition, a number of students 
suffered from fainting and suffocation due to inhaling tear gas used 
intensively by the Israeli occupation forces. 

<p>This morning, clashes broke out between Palestinian civilians and the 
Israeli occupation forces near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east 
of Gaza City. The Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian 
demonstrators, wounding two with live bullets in the head. The two 
were evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City in serious to critical 
condition. They are: 1) Medhat Mohammed Subhi Jadallah, 17 years old, 
from Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, critically wounded with a 
live bullet in the forehead; and 2) Bassel Arafat Oleyan, 13 years 
old, from Al-Daraj neighborhood in Gaza, seriously wounded with a live 
bullet in the head. 

<p>Yesterday evening, medical sources at Shifa’ hospital stated that the 
child Mohammed Mohammed El-Mashharawi, 14 years old, from Al-Tuffah 
neighborhood in Gaza City, died from a previous wound with a live 
bullet in the head incurred when the Israeli occupation forces shot at 
Palestinian civilians near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet on November 26, 
2000. He was put in the intensive care unit of Shifa’ hospital until 
he died. 

<p>Yesterday evening, at about 22:00 local time, the Israeli occupation 
forces shot at Palestinian civilians in Al-Qarara when these civilians 
tried to head off the sweeping of their agricultural land and houses 
by these forces (see the section on sweeping below). As a result, 
three Palestinian civilians were wounded with live bullets and 
evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza. They are: 1) Mohammed Ahmed 
El-Eddini, 23 years old, wounded with a live bullet in the head that 
penetrated the lower jaw. He was put in the intensive care unit of 
the hospital; 2) Khaled Abdel-Karim Abu E’id, 27 years old, wounded 
with a live bullet in the neck; and 3) Mohammed Salem Abdel-Karim Abu 
E’id, 25 years old, slightly wounded with a live bullet in the head. 

<p>In his testimony to PCHR, Mohammed Abu E’id stated that the Israeli 
occupation forces shot from guns equipped with silencers, wounding him 
and another two civilians in the area. He added that the Israeli 
occupation forces prevented the entry of ambulances into the area to 
evacuate them, so residents of the area were forced to carry them for 
a distance of 400 meters to reach an ambulance. 

<p>Yesterday evening, at about 19:00, Israeli occupation troops, 
positioned in a military post in the vicinity of Gani Tal settlement, 
to the north of Al-Amal neighborhood in Khan Yunis, opened fire on 
Palestinian civilians, wounding A’adel Talab Joudeh, 50 years old, 
with a live bullet in the foot. Joudeh was evacuated to Shifa’ 
hospital in Gaza City. He was on his way home after praying in a 
nearby mosque when he was shot at from a distance of about 300 meters. 
This incident is the second of its kind in this area in less than 24 
hours. In the first incident, two Palestinian civilians were wounded 
with live bullets in the thigh, on the evening of Tuesday, November 
28, 2000, in similar conditions and when there were no clashes in the 
area. 

<p>Also yesterday in Khan Yunis, at about 19:00 local time, Israeli 
occupation troops fired sound bombs on the refugee camp of Khan Yunis 
from their position at Al-Tuffah roadblock, which separates Khan Yunis 
city from its Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area (which is under the 
control of the Israeli occupation forces). One of the bombs fell on 
the house of Muhsen Rajab El-Batsch, 300 meters away from the military 
post of the Israeli occupation forces, causing severe damage to the 
asbestos roof of the house. Debris from the weapon wounded his two 
daughters while they were in the house. They are: 1) Sara’ Muhsen 
El-Batsch, 11 years old, wounded in the head; and 2) Einas Muhsen 
El-Batsch, 16 years old, wounded in the shoulder. The two were 
evacuated to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis. PCHR’s field officer in 
Khan Yunis reported that sound bombs are used to terrify Palestinian 
civilians when there are no clashes in an area. Residents of the area 
assert that military posts of the Israeli occupation forces are 
permanent sources of threat to their lives and safety. 

<p>Yesterday afternoon, at about 15:00 local time, the Israeli occupation 
forces shot at Palestinian civilians while they were passing through 
one of the roadblocks of these forces on a road which Palestinian 
civilians resort to as an alternative to Salah El-Din Street (the main 
road between the north and south of the Gaza Strip), which the Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to completely close. The alternative 
road branches from Salah El-Din Street to the east and then to the 
south in the vicinity of the eastern border of Kfar Darom settlement, 
before it goes to the west to Salah El-Din Street. The shooting 
wounded two Palestinian civilians with live bullets. They are: 1) 
Bassam Mohammed Sae’id, 15 years old, wounded with a live bullet in 
the thigh; and 2) Aae’d Mohammed Brei’m, wounded with a live bullet in 
the thigh. 

A settler intentionally hits a Palestinian child with his car 

In Bethlehem, this morning, the child Shadi Ahmed Zaou’l, 14 years 
old, from the village of Housan, was killed when a Jewish settler 
willfully hit him with his car. PCHR learned that the child Zaou’l 
was alongside Route 60 when a white GMC car driven by a Jewish settler 
suddenly deviated from its direction and hit him. The settler 
escaped, and the child died on the way to hospital. 


<p>2. Continued Sweeping of Agricultural Land 
<p>
This morning, at about 4:00 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
swept more areas of agricultural land on both sides of the road 
leading from Al-Shuhada junction on Salah El-Din Street (the main road 
between the north and south of the Gaza Strip) to Netzarim settlement 
in the west (south of Gaza City). PCHR’s field officer in the area 
reported that the sweeping included: 1) A 10-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with citrus, owned by Shukri El-Saqqa. 2) A 
three-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives and citrus, 
owned by Mahmoud Sha’ban El-Helou. 3) A three-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with citrus, owned by Abu Ibrahim El-Ashram. 
In the north of Beit Lahia, PCHR’s field officer reported that this 
morning, the Israeli occupation forces completed the sweeping, which 
started three days ago, of agricultural land to the northwest of Dogit 
settlement. They swept 30 donums of agricultural land planted with 
citrus and olives, owned by Zuhdi Abu A’msheh. 

<p>Yesterday, at about 21:00, Israeli occupation troops reinforced with 
tanks and bulldozers started to sweep areas of agricultural land and 
to demolish houses to the southeast of Kfar Darom settlement, near the 
road branch of Salah El-Din Street and Kissufim Crossing (700 meters 
from Salah El-Din Street). PCHR’s field officer in the area reported 
that the sweeping included: 1) A 25-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with olives and almonds, owned by Mustafa Abu Gharaba. 2) A 
25-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives and almonds, 
owned by Salem Salameh Abu Gharaba. 3) A six-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives and palms, owned by A’tteya 
Mohammed Suleiman Abu Zhaher. In addition, a store of agricultural 
equipment and a bird farm were demolished. Birds were killed 4) A 
one-donum area of agricultural land along with a greenhouse planted 
with vegetables, owned by Suleiman Atweh Abu E’id. 

<p>This morning, at about 3:00, the Israeli occupation forces swept areas 
of agricultural land on both sides of the road between Al-Shuhada’ 
(Netzarim) junction and Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza 
City. PCHR’s field officer in the area reported that the sweeping 
lasted for four hours and included: 1) A 10-donum area of agricultural 
land planted with olives, owned by Hassan Shuheiber. 2) A 10-donum 
area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Najib 
Shuheiber. 3) A 20-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Oudeh El-Ghefari. In addition, a well was destroyed. 
4) A four-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned 
by Abed Murjan Abu Asser. 5) A four-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with olives, owned by Marwan El-Thalathini. 6) A two-donum 
area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Wasfi 
Doghmosh. 7) A two-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Wajih El-Thalathini. 8) A two-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Ziad Barakat. 9) A 
three-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Ziad Hajji. 10) A three-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Hamdi Hajji. 11) A five-donum area of agricultural 
land planted with olives and vegetables, owned by Fawwaz Hajji. In 
addition, an irrigation network was destroyed. 12) A two-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Fahmi Siam. 13) A 
2.5-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Ahmed Abu Dayyeh. 14) A one-donum area of agricultural land planted 
with olives, owned by Mesbah Hajji. 15) A one-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by El-Abed Karim. 16) A 
four-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Ezzat Hajji. 17) A one-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Khaled Quzaat. 18) A one-donum area of agricultural 
land planted with olives, owned by Eissa Quzaat. 19) A three-donum 
area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Abu Akram 
El-Serhi. 20) A two-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Jamal El-Serhi. 21) A one-donum area of agricultural 
land planted with olives, owned by a member of the Abu Serreyeh 
family. 

<p> 
PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to 
immediately intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian 
civilians. PCHR calls in particular for: 

<p>1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in 
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and 
killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians. <p>2. Convening a conference of the High 
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure 
Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Convention. <p>3. 
Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the 
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces. <p>4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights. <p>5. Providing 
humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose 
living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the 
continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
entire occupied Palestinian territories.<p> 6. Use by the international 
community and relevant bodies, including ICRC, of necessary measures 
to ensure the access of medical supplies and equipment and other 
humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. The Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to deny entry of this material 
through Rafah Border Crossing (into the Gaza Strip).

<p>(Jerusalem) On Wednesday, November 29, 2000, the internationally 
recognized day of solidarity with the Palestinian people, Americans 
for Justice in Palestine held a successful demonstration in front of 
the U.S. Consulate in West Jerusalem.  The peaceful, lawful protest 
was intended to protest our government's continued support of Israeli 
occupation.  

<p>A small but vocal group of American citizens living and working in the 
Palestinian Occupied Territories gathered at the Agron St. Consulate 
from 12:00 noon until 1:00 PM. The demonstration did not take place in 
East Jerusalem, as originally planned, as the Israeli police forbade 
that location, in spite of the groups expressed fears of violent 
responses from Israelis on the West Side. The group held signs in 
protest of U.S policies toward Israel, in particular challenging the 6 
billion dollars per annum in military aid.  Additional banners called 
for peace and justice, human rights and recognition of the inherent 
right of the Palestinian people to resist occupation.  The group also 
chanted slogans calling for an end to the occupation, asking the U.S. 
to stand for justice, for the removal of Israeli settlers and to 
implement UN resolutions.   The protest drew scores of angry looks and 
gestures from passing motorists and a few Israeli by passers stopped 
to pepper the group with a variety of epithets. 

<p>The group's coordinators had requested a meeting with the U.S. Consul 
General in advance of the protest, and a meeting with Vice Consul 
Gerald Feierstein was granted.  The representatives of the group were 
warmly greeted and the meeting, which lasted for approximately 45 
minutes, was cordial and productive.  The representatives reiterated 
the groups objectives and presented the Vice Consul with a list of 
demands for the U.S. Government, a letter to President Clinton 
condemning the violence, and a letter from a 16 year-old Palestinian 
American in Tulkarem asking his government to intervene to protect him 
from Israeli bombardment of his home and school.  The last letter was 
presented on behalf of all Palestinian Americans who would like to 
have their voices heard but are barred from leaving the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip due to Israel's "security" measures. 

<p>During the bulk of the meeting, the Vice Consul expressed his belief 
that U.S. policy was slowly changing and the U.S. decision-makers were 
finally becoming more and more aware of the Palestinian position.  The 
representatives agreed that noticeable changes were taking place, 
however, fell far short of what is necessary to uphold the democratic 
ideals of our nation: chiefly, freedom, equality, justice and 
liberty.  The Vice Consul expressed empathy with our concerns and 
encouraged the group to continue its campaign and to carry our message 
to our elected representatives in the Congress whenever possible.  He 
also encouraged the group to contact the representatives of the local 
media.   

<p>Lastly, the question of the protection of American citizens, 
particularly, 16 year old American citizen Wael Hirbawi, imprisoned by 
Israel without trial for more than 2 months, was raised with the Vice 
Consul.  Mr. Feierstein commented that he was aware of the particular 
case and that it had been recently reported to Washington.  He assured 
the representatives that Consulate officials had been routinely 
inquiring into his well-being and had visited Mr.Hirbawi.  He, 
however, commented that the Israelis were very sensitive in this 
matter and less than cooperative with official U.S. concerns. 

<p>Americans for Justice in Palestine would like to thank those who 
participated in the demonstration, those who expressed support of our 
activities and the Vice Consul and staff at the U.S. Consulate for 
their warm and encouraging response to our initiatives.

Allegations of torture in Israeli prisons
 </b></p>
      


<p>Israeli occupation soldiers and police are alleged to have been
involved in torturing Rami Iz'oul, 18, from the village of Housan near
Bethlehem, at the Kfar Atsyon interrogation centre. They are also
believed to have tortured Arwad Thamanji, 20, from Jenin.

<p>During a prison visit by LAW's lawyer Labib Habib, Iz'oul told him
that Israeli soldiers had captured him in his family's house on 30
October 2000 and beat him severely. He was later transferred to
Kfar
Atsyon, where he was also beaten and had freezing water poured
over
his head during an interrigation. Iz'oul also stated that he was taken
to Hadassa hospital for medical treatment. He stayed there one
night
before being taken back to interrogation. He said that he was forced
to sign a document of confession under threat.

<p>Thannji, who was arrested on May 19 2000, stated that he was severely
beaten by Israeli soldiers and pulled along the ground until he lost
consciousness. He was later transferred to Al Afoula hospital and then
to Megiddo prison, where he is today. He complained of severe beating,
assault and threate on several occasions, adding that he has not been
receiving appropriate medical treatement and that the doctor refused
to treat his wounds. The lawyer also met with detainees Ra'ouf Abu
Gheih from Ezariyyeh and Jaser Sawafta from Toubas, who are being held
for entering Israel without permit.

<p>Despite the State's claims, and the fact that torture was officially
made illegal on 6 September 1999, it is clear that torture is still
used by Israel against innocent people to extract general information
or to force the signing of false confessions prepared by the security
services in advance. These are not associated with serious threats
against the State or its citizens, but in any case the use of torture
is questionable in the interests of security: the victim suffers from
severe psychological distress and any information imparted cannot be
relied upon. Despite this, throughout Israel's occupation these
confessions have been used to convict Palestinians to lengthy prison
terms, as the Israel military courts tend to accept these confessions
as valid, even in the absence of other evidence.

students, Mahir Nawadea, 17, shot in the abdomen, and Fat’hi el
Baden,
shot in the abdomen and the left arm are in critical condition. LAW
is
currently investigating the reason behind the shooting.

<p>Sahdi Az’oul 14 was injured after being run over by a settler’s car on
Route 60 near Bethlehem. Eyewitness told LAW that a settler
driving a
white GMC hit Az’oul as he was crossing the road near the Beitar
settlement and then drove off. According to the witness the road
was
empty of traffic and the driver would have been able to see Az’oul
crossing the road. Az’oul is the second Palestinian child in two
months to be involved in a hit and run allegedly involving settlers.

<p>In Gaza yesterday afternoon, Israeli military bulldozers leveled
agricultural land belonging to Atiyi Abu Tha’hir, east of Kosafim

Palestinians. Mohammad Abu Eed, 26, was shot in the head and Abed el
Arabi, 27, was shot in the mouth. Both are in critical condition. The
