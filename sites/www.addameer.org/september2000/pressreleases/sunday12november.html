<p><b>Canadian Arabs and Muslims meet with Canadian Prime Minister Chretien 
</b></p>

                            

  <p>A group of representatives of the Canadian Arab and Muslim
communities from
 accross Canada met on Sunday November 12, 2000 in Ottawa
with Prime Minister
 Chretien. The purpose of the meeting was to convey our
communities concerns
 about Canada s recent voting at the UN. We also voiced our
expectations that
 Canada should uphold the principles of international justice and
legitimacy
 embodied in UN Security Council resolutions 242, 338, and
1322, as well as
 the Fourth Geneva Convention, which are supported by
Canada.

 <p> We reminded Mr. Chretien that there is a military occupation of
Gaza and
the
 West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in defiance of international
law and of
 UN Security Council resolutions. We stressed that it is not
possible to find
 a sustainable solution to end years of violence without ending the
military
 occupation and without the implementation of Security Council
resolutions.

 <p> We agreed that Canada s international reputation and
effectiveness depends
 on its continuous upholding of Canadian values as embodied in
the stated
 principles of our foreign policy. We asked that these principles
be applied
 in the current conflict in the Middle East.

 <p> The Prime Minister assured us that his doors are open to us and
that he
 welcomed continuous communications with our community. We
suggested that
 Canada could be involved in initiating a new approach towards
addressing the
 current deadlock in the Middle East. He showed interest and
requested
written
 suggestions.

          <p> News update Sunday, November 12, 2000<p> Today <p>events:Mohammed Nafith Abu-Naji, 17, from Shiekh Radwan in Gaza, was killed when two bullet struck him in the shoulder and chest during demonstrations in Beit Hanoun.<p> Other clashes continued throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip as Palestinians buried 5 more Palestinian demonstrators. Israel continues to use excessive force throughout the Occupied Territories, especially in Beit Sahour where three homes were destroyed by shelling from Israeli tanks. One house in a crowded residential neighborhood was set on fire caused by the shelling. The city of al-Bireh was shelled continuously throughout last evening causing the death of two Palestinians. Severe damage to property throughout al-Bireh was documented. The shelling has been the heaviest seen in the Ramallah District to date.<p> In a separate event, settlers opened fire on the vehicles carrying UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ms. Mary Robinson and her delegation while they visited downtown Hebron. One bullet struck a TIPH patrol car standing in front of the TIPH shuttle. One member of the delegation witnessed a phosphoric trailed bullet pass him, nearly striking one of his colleagues.The incident took place in an area between Tel Armada and Beit Haddasa, an area with a history of documented settler violence.<p> Summary of events in Gaza on 11/11/00:<p> In the second extrajudicial killing in three days, Israeli Occupying Forces have killed Munzer Hamdi Yassin, 25, and Muhammad Wassin Darwish, 25, both from Shati Refugee Camp in the Gaza Strip. Al-Haq is gravely concerned about the lives of Palestinian civilians in the Palestinian Territories, especially in view of the recent upsurge in arbitrary and summary executions perpetrated by the Israeli Authorities.<p> As the attention of the world focused on the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights Ms. Mary Robinson’s visit to the Gaza strip, Israel military personnel opened fire on to the car driven by Muhammad Darwish and Munzer Yassin without provocation.Furthermore, after their bodies were riddled with bullets, the victims vehicle was closed off in an area near the illegal Gush Qatif settlement. Ambulances were not allowed into the area to assist them. Eventually the victims were removed from the vehicle by a crane and their car was blown up by the Israel military. <p>Al-Haq reiterates its demands and calls on all High Contracting Parties to the IV Geneva Convention to signal to the Israeli authorities that it will not abide death missions.High Contracting Parties can actively communicate this by asking their judicial authorities to open prosecution briefs on willful killings in the Israeli occupied territories.<p>Al-Haq also calls on the international community of states to exercise its role under international law and to adopt effective measures, including economic sanctions, to oblige Israel to adhere to UN resolutions, and to pressure the Israeli government in order to put an end to its aggressive actions in the Occupied Palestinian territory<p> Al-Haq reiterates its demands for an international peace keeping force for the protection of the Palestinian people.

<p><b>The massacre continues:
The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces shell the Palestinian
civilians and kill 8 of them
</b></p>




<p>The belligerent Israeli Occupation Army has continued to increase
its
use of excessive and lethal force against the Palestinian civilians in
the Occupied Territories. Yesterday, 11/11/2000, the Israeli Army
deliberately killed Palestinian civilians by bombarding Palestinian
civilian cars and houses. Yesterday, 11/11/2000 at about 12:30
p.m.
(10:30 GMT), Israeli soldiers opened fire at a civilian Palestinian
car near Almatahin junction in the south of Gaza Strip. As a result,
Monzir Hamdy Yaseen (a 22 year-old resident of Asheikh Redhwan
in
Gaza), and Mohammad Yaseen Almadhoun (a 22 year-old resident of Ashaty
refugee camp in Gaza) were killed. Soon after this, the Israeli army
exploded the car, detained their dead bodies, and closed Salah Addeen
road that connects Gaza with Rafah. Mrs. Mary Robinson, the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, who had been on her trip from Rafah to
Gaza after paying a visit to observe the damage resulting from the
Israeli shelling of Palestinian civil properties, was prevented from
continuing her way to Gaza. The Israeli soldiers delayed her journey
by two and a half hours. They let her and the accompanying UN cars
travel along the Jewish settlements’ road while preventing the
accompanying Palestinians, (who had to travel along a roundroad).
Yesterday evening, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces had
heavily shelled Albireh using anti-tank missiles and machine-guns. As
a result, Osamah Khaleel Albawab (28 years old) and Majid Husein
Aljaro (30 years old) were killed.

<p>In the context of the policy which seems to aim to kill the highest
possible number of Palestinian civilians, the Israeli army opened fire
at unarmed Palestinian civilians. This led to the killing of:<br> 1. Mosa
Ibraheem Addibs, a 15 year- old resident of Jabalya refugee camp who
was shot in the heart.<br> 2. Moneeb Mohammad Abu Minshar, a 17 year- old
resident of Hebron who was shot in the heart.<br> 3. Hany Abdallah Abu
Marzouq, a 37 year- old resident of Jenin who was shot in the heart on
10/11/2000.<br> 4. Ayman Salah Wady, a 20 year- old resident of Khan
Younis who was shot in the head. This raises the number of
Palestinians killed by the Israelis since 29/9/2000 to 187.

<p>Today, 12/11/2000, at about 4:00 a.m. (2:00 GMT), the belligerent
Israeli Occupation Army has shelled civilan houses in Rafah in the
Gaza Strip leading to their total or partial damage. The damaged
houses belong to: <br>1. Saeed Mahmoud Musslih Zurub. <br>  2. Sad Mohammad
Hasan Jabr. <br>3. Husein Ayyad Hajjaj Assoufy.   <br>     4. Khalid Oudah
MusslihZurub. <br>5. Wail Saeed Mohammad Zurub.  <br>     6. Hisham Oudah
Musslih Zurub.<br> 7. Musstafa Ayyad  Hajjaj Assoufy.  <br>  8. Hasan Ibraheem
Jaddou Assoufy. <br>9. Husein Mohammad Hasan Jabr.

<p>Today, 12/11/2000, since 12:00 noon (10:00 GMT) until this time, the
belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have been brutally shelling Beit
Jala in the West Bank using missiles and machine-guns. As a result, 7
houses have been severley damaged (One of the houses has been on
fire). 9 Palestinian civilians including two children have been
injured during the shelling. One of the two children has been
seriously injured in the chest. Four cars have been destroyed and two
others burnt during the attack. The Orthothox sport club has also been
heavily damaged as a result of the shelling. In the same context, a
Jewish settler has opened fire at a group of Palestinian pupils in
Taqou village near Bethlehem. As a result one pupil has been injured.

<p>AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights stresses that the killing of
Palestinian civilians and destruction of Palestinian civil properties
by the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces constitute
anti-humanitarian and war crimes that necessitate immediate and
effective interference by the international community aiming at
putting an end to the Israeli aggression and bringing the Israeli war
criminals to trial. AL-MEZAN also requests the international community
to provide protection for the Palestinian civilians and to put an end
to the massacres committed against them.
