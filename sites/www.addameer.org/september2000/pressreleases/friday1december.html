International human rights monitors needed to protect lives in 
Israel and the Occupied Territories </b></p>


<p>

Since late September, renewed violence in Israel and the Occupied 
Territories, including areas under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian 
Authority, has led to widespread human rights violations. 

<p>
* More than 280 people have been killed, many of whom were children. 

<p>
* The majority of the deaths have been Palestinians killed by 
Israeli security forces. Amnesty International has expressed concern 
that many of these deaths have occurred because security forces have 
resorted to lethal force in circumstances in which lives were not in 
imminent danger. 

<p>
* Amnesty has also spoken out and condemned the killings of a number 
of Jews in bombing attacks on civilian targets, such as a school bus 
and a market in Jerusalem. 

<p>
* There are numerous reports of beatings and ill-treatment by Israeli 
police. 

<p>
* Amnesty has called for investigations into all allegations of human 
rights abuse and has highlighted the importance of ensuring that those 
responsible be brought to justice. 

<p>
Increasingly Amnesty International is convinced that there is an 
important international role to be played in protecting human rights 
in the area. We have strongly endorsed the recommendation made by Mary 
Robinson, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights, for 
international human rights monitors in the region. 
<p>
In an open letter to the UN Security Council on November 24, Amnesty 
International urged the creation of "an international human rights 
monitoring presence to provide accurate, unbiased reporting by 
impartial witnesses on the observance of human rights and humanitarian 
law by all sides." 
<p>
An effective and independent international human rights presence in 
Israel and the Occupied Territories, including areas under the control 
of the Palestinian Authority will help to bring the violence committed 
by both sides to the current conflict to an end, avoid new provocative 
actions and promote the prospects for peace. 

<p>
Canada is coming to the end of a two year term as member of the 
Security Council. Until December 31, 2000 Canada can play an important 
role in encouraging the Security Council to establish an international 
human rights monitoring presence. 

<p>
TAKE ACTION 
<p>
Send a message to the Prime Minister of Canada. Tell him that as he 
begins his third term of government you want Canada to take a strong 
stand for human rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories, 
including the areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority. 
Urge him to take advantage of Canada's final month on the Security 
Council. Tell him that you want Canada to support the creation of an 
international human rights monitoring presence in the region.

First Friday of Ramadan </b></p>



<p>Today, the first Friday of Ramadan, Israeli officials allowed all
Palestinian East Jerusalemites and those with Israeli citizenship
access to the Haram Al-Sharif compound for noon prayers.
However, West
Bank and Gaza Palestinians were still denied access to Jerusalem.
Hundreds of Palestinians also prayed outside Damascus and Lion’s
gates. The noon prayers passed without major incident.

<p>At 2:30 this afternoon, Israeli forces stationed at Tel Za’arab on the
Palestinian-Egyptian border killed 12-year-old Muhammed Saleh
Muhammed
Arjan from Rafah. According to sources in Gaza, Israeli forces shot
Arjan as he was playing along the border near the outpost. He was
hit
in the neck and taken to the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis where he
was pronounced dead.

<p>Israeli forces killed a second Palestinian, Hamzeh Nadi Hassis, 27,
from Al Sammu’a during clashes that took place this afternoon at the
southern entrance to the village of Sammu’a near Hebron. Hassis was
shot with live ammunition in the chest. He died instantly. Due to road
closures imposed by the Israeli forces the ambulance arrive 90 minutes
later. Usually, the trip from the city of Hebron to the village takes
15 minutes.

<p>Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians demonstrators broke
out between the H1 and H2 areas of Hebron. Two people were injured.
Yacoub Abd Al Aziz Dandis, 32, was shot in the shoulder while
shopping.

<p>As the Al Aqsa Intifada enters its third month, over 250 Palestinians
have been killed and more than 9,000 injured.

<h3>Miftah</h3>

<p><b>
Raw Deal </b></p>


<p>A "trapped" Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, seems more
desperate
than any other time in his leadership to strike a deal with the
Palestinians, albeit a raw deal; a shortsighted deal that fails to
even consider the imperatives of peace. The fact is that Barak
needs
some kind of peace deal to survive internal political upheaval, and
lead his Labour party to victory in the upcoming Israeli elections.

<p>Yet, by proposing to recognise a Palestinian state and withdraw
from
another 10% of the West Bank (leaving only 50% of all territories
occupied in June 1967 under full or partial Palestinian control),
Barak is, in reality, offering nothing. By proposing a new interim
agreement that postpones negotiations on the issues of Jerusalem
and
the Refugees for another two years, Barak is wilfully failing to
address the real causes of conflict, and in tern, driving the region
into yet another dangerous abyss.

<p>Such misperception of reality, and delusional interpretation of the
current crisis in the peace process, cannot be accommodated by
the
Palestinians. With a deeply dichotomised Knesset and a weaker
Barak,
the peace process finds itself trapped in a gloomy phase of
uncertainty and dismay.

<p>There is an urgent need for Israel to finally address the real issues
and put an end to the conflict by unconditionally implementing UN
Resolutions 242, 338, and 194. This is the best deal; this is the
only
deal.

Tanks shell Khan Yunis: 
Israeli occupation forces kill a child from Rafah and a man from 
Al-Boreij; More sweeping of agricultural land and demolition of houses  </b></p>


<p>Despite clashes between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli 
occupation forces in the occupied Palestinian territories 
significantly decreasing, the Israeli occupation forces have continued 
to perpetrate serious abuses against Palestinian civilians, including 
shooting at civilians and shelling residential neighborhoods. This 
afternoon, at about 14:30 local time, the Israeli occupation forces 
continued their widespread human rights abuses when they killed a 
12-year-old Palestinian child with a live bullet in the neck. 
Yesterday evening, a young man from Al-Boreij was shot dead by Israeli 
occupation forces with a live bullet in the head. The Khan Yunis 
refugee camp was shelled from military posts and by tanks of the 
Israeli occupation forces in the vicinity of Al-Tuffah roadblock and 
Neve Dekalim settlement. In the past 24 hours, the Israeli occupation 
forces have continued to sweep agricultural land and to demolish 
civilian facilities in Al-Qarara, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. 

<p>1. Shooting at Palestinian Civilians 

<p>This afternoon, 12-year-old child Mohammed Sleh Mohammed El-A’rja, 
from Rafah, was shot dead with a live bullet in the neck by the 
Israeli occupation forces. PCHR’s field officer in Rafah reported 
that the child was playing near his house adjacent to the 
Palestinian-Egyptian border in Rafah, when a soldier of the Israeli 
occupation forces shot him dead from a great distance at about 14:30 
local time. The child was evacuated to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, 
where was pronounced dead. This grave human rights violation is 
another to be added to the record of willful killings committed by the 
Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian civilians, including 
children. 

<p>Near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east of Gaza City, the Israeli 
occupation forces shot at a number of Palestinian young men, who 
gathered about 150 meters away from these forces, which were 
reinforced with tanks on the main road between the area and 
Al-Shuhada’ (Netzarim) junction on Salah El-Din Street. As a result, 
a young man was wounded with a live bullet in the foot. He was 
evacuated to Shifa’ hospital in Gaza City. 

<p>In Khan Yunis, this morning, the Israeli occupation forces shot at 
Palestinian civilians, wounding one, despite there being no clashes at 
the time. PCHR’s field officer in Khan Yunis reported that this 
morning, at 9:30 local time, Israeli occupation troops positioned in 
the vicinity of Gadid settlement, in the southwest of Khan Yunis, shot 
at two Palestinian young men who were more than 150 meters away from 
the military post. As a result, Karam Mustafa Jadallah, 17 years old, 
was wounded with a live bullet in the foot. He was evacuated to 
Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis city. PCHR’s field officer added that 
shooting by the Israeli occupation forces at Palestinian civilians, 
even when there are no clashes, is a daily occurrence. These forces 
are a source of permanent threat to the safety and security of 
Palestinian civilians. 

<p>Also in Khan Yunis, yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces 
fired live bullets and artillery shells at the refugee camp of Khan 
Yunis, wounding a Palestinian civilian and damaging a number of 
houses. Palestinian civilians were terrified and fled their houses. 
PCHR’s field officer in Khan Yunis reported that yesterday evening, at 
about 22:00 local time, Israeli occupation troops, positioned at 
Al-Tuffah Roadblock and Neve Dekalim settlement, shot heavy and medium 
bullets at Palestinian houses in the west of the refugee camp of Khan 
Yunis. Tanks of these forces also fired four shells at the area. As 
a result, Mouaffaq Mohammed Yousef El-Khatib, 37 years old, was 
wounded with shrapnel in the chest and the hands. He was evacuated to 
Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis. The shells hit the following: 1) The 
house of Mustafa Mohammed El-Doush, an asbestos-roofed, one-story 
house in which 11 people live. The roof, walls and furniture were 
partially destroyed. 2) The house of Khalil Hassan Farahat, an 
asbestos-roofed, one-story house in which eight people live. The roof 
and water reservoirs were partially destroyed. 3) The three-story 
house lived in by Fayez Oudeh Abu Akker. A shell penetrated a wall of 
the second floor, hitting the children’s room and destroying windows 
and furniture. 

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian 
civilians, who demonstrated more than 150 meters away from a military 
post of these forces, to the east of Al-Boreij refugee camp. These 
forces shot at Palestinian civilians, killing Ismail Abdel-Salam Abu 
El-Rous, 20 years old, with a live bullet in the head. PCHR’s field 
officer reported that the shooting took place when Palestinian young 
men did not pose any threat to these forces. He added that a sniper 
of the Israeli occupation forces shot with the aim to kill. No other 
injuries were reported. 

<p>2. Continued Sweeping of Agricultural Land 

<p>Yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces continued their 
sweeping and demolition in the area of Al-Qarara, which they started 
on Wednesday, November 29, 2000. The sweeping and demolition included 
areas of agricultural land and houses, to the southeast of Kfar Darom 
settlement, near the road branch of Salah El-Din Street (the main road 
between the north and south of the Gaza Strip), leading to Kissufim 
Crossing. This particular action included: 1) A one-donum area of 
agricultural land on which a greenhouse planted with vegetables was 
established, owned by Joma’a Mosallam El-Semeiri. 2) A four-donum area 
of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Abdullah Abu 
Meghasib. In addition a well, a water reservoir and a store of 
agricultural equipment were destroyed. 3) A five-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Suleiman Abu A’mra. 4) 
A four-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Mohammed El-A’ttar. 5) An eight-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with olives, owned by Ahmed Hussein El-Semeiri. 6) An 
eight-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned by 
Ali Salameh El-Semeiri. 7) A nine-donum area of agricultural land 
planted with olives, owned by Hussein Suleiman El-Semeiri. 8) A

irrigation network were destroyed. 9) A four-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Suleiman Hussein 
El-Semeiri. 10) A 20-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Abed Ahmed El-Farra. 11) A two-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives, owned by Abdel-Qader Abu 
Meghasib. 12) A four-donum area of agricultural land planted with 
olives, owned by Abed Joma’a El-Semeiri. 13) A 20-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with olives and almonds, owned by Abed Rabbo 
Ahmed El-Semeiri. 14) A two-donum area of agricultural land planted 
with olives, owned by Abdel-Rahim El-Semeiri. 15) A six-donum area of 
agricultural land planted with vegetables, owned by Zayed El-Semeiri. 
16) A two-donum area of agricultural land planted with olives, owned 
by Mazen El-Semeiri. 17) A two-donum area of agricultural land planted 
with olives, owned by Suleiman Ahmed El-Semeiri. 18) A 12-donum area 
of agricultural land planted with olives and vegetables, owned by 
Shukri Abu A’mra. 19) A bird farm established on a 100-square-meter 
area of land, owned by Medhat Khattab. 20) A 150-square-meter, 
one-story house owned by Rae’s Suleiman El-Semeiri. 21) A 
120-square-meter, one story house owned by Ibrahim Suleiman 
El-Semeiri. In addition, a water pump, a pool and a room of 
agricultural equipment were destroyed. 


<p>PCHR reiterates its call for the international community to 
immediately intervene to stop the killings and criminal acts 
perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against Palestinian 
civilians. PCHR calls in particular for: 

<p>1. Establishing without delay an independent commission of inquiry, in 
accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1322 (2000), to carry 
out a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the abuses and 
killings perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces against 
Palestinian civilians. 2. Convening a conference of the High 
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to ensure 
Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Convention. 3. 
Immediately providing international protection for Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories in the face of the 
killings and criminal acts perpetrated by the Israeli occupation 
forces and groups of Jewish settlers who move under the protection of 
these forces. 4. Use by the EU of effective political and economic 
measures with reference to Article 2 of the Euro-Israel Association 
Agreement, which calls for the respect of human rights. 5. Providing 
humanitarian and medical assistance for the Palestinian people whose 
living conditions are increasingly deteriorating because of the 
continued total siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
entire occupied Palestinian territories. 6. Use by the international 
community and relevant bodies, including ICRC, of necessary measures 
to ensure the access of medical supplies and equipment and other 
humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians. The Israeli 
occupation forces have continued to deny entry of this material 
through Rafah Border Crossing (into the Gaza Strip).

<p><b>
The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT
intervention in the following situation in Israel. </b></p>
<p>
Brief description of the situation
<p>
The International Secretariat of OMCT has been informed by
the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and
the Environment, (LAW), a member of the OMCT network, of
allegations of torture in Israeli prisons.
<p>
According to the information received, Israeli occupation
soldiers and police are alleged to have been involved in torturing
Rami Iz'oul, 18, from the village of Housan near Bethlehem, at the
Kfar Atsyon interrogation centre. They are also believed to have
tortured Arwad Thamanji, 20, from Jenin.

<p>During a prison visit by LAW's lawyer Labib Habib, Iz'oul told
him that Israeli soldiers had captured him in his family's house on 30
October 2000 and beat him severely. He was later transferred to Kfar
Atsyon, where he was also beaten and had freezing water poured over
his head during an interrogation. Iz'oul also stated that he was taken
to Hadassa hospital for medical treatment. He stayed there one night
before being taken back to be interrogated. He said that he was forced
to sign a document of confession under threat.

<p>Thannji, who was arrested on May 19 2000, stated that he was
severely beaten by Israeli soldiers and pulled along the ground
until he lost consciousness. He was later transferred to Al Afoula
hospital and then to Megiddo prison, where he is today. He complained
of severe beating, assault and threats on several occasions, adding
that he has not been receiving appropriate medical treatment and that
the doctor refused to treat his wounds. The lawyer also met with
detainees Ra'ouf Abu Gheih from Ezariyyeh and Jaser Sawafta from
Toubas, who are being held for entering Israel without a permit.

<p>The International Secretariat is gravely concerned that in spite of
the State's claims, and the fact that torture was officially made
illegal on 6 September 1999, it is clear that torture is still used by
Israel against innocent people to extract general information or to
force the signing of false confessions prepared by the security
services in advance. Furthermore, LAW notes that throughout Israel's
occupation these confessions have been used to convict Palestinians to
lengthy prison terms, as the Israel military courts tend to accept
these confessions as valid, even in the absence of other evidence.

<p>Actions requested

<p>Please continue to write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:

<p>i.  Guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of
    the aforementioned persons and all prisoners and
    order their immediate release in the absence of valid
    charges;
<p>ii. Order an immediate investigation into the alleged
    arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture, in order
    to identify those responsible, bring them to trial and
    apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions
    provided by law;
<p>iii.guarantee the respect of human rights and the
    fundamental freedoms throughout the country in
    accordance with national laws and international
    human rights standards.
