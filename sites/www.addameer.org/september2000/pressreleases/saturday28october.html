<p>    For the 29th consecutive day the belligerent Israeli occupation
forces continued their aggression against the Palestinian civilians
and civilian property. The use of lethal and excessive force has
increased. The clashes today have concentrated in Rafah,
KhanYounis
and Der Albalah. As a result, 20 civilians have been wounded,
including: 1. Mohammad Mustafa Aljazzar, 18 years old, from
Rafah. A
bullet penetrated his head and came out through the eye, his state
is
considered critical. 2. Mohammad Sad Alhusain, 15 years old,
from Khan
Younis. A bullet penetrated his chest and came out through the
back.
His condition is also considered critical.
  <p>   Aziz Yousef Ibrahim Attanih, 32 years old, was martyred as he
suffered from a head injury resulting from being hit by a part of a
missile fired by Israeli helicopters on 19th October. He was a
correspondent to the Palestinian news agency (Wafa).
   <p> Yesterday, Friday, Bethlehem, Bait Sahur, Bait Jala and Jericho
    were
struck with missiles from Israeli helicopters aiming at civilian
houses. The firing was concentrated in the center of the Aida refugee
camp in Bethlehem. The occupation forces also specifically targeted
civilian houses in Rafah; which caused damages to houses far from the
clashes, the Canada refugee camp and Tal Assultan areas, aside from
the daily targeting of the civilian houses situated in the
neighborhood of Salah Eddin Gate and Tel Zu’rob.
<p>     The siege imposed by Israelis upon the cities in the West Bank
     has
continued. The siege does not only affect travel, transportation of
the wounded and of goods, but also picking the olives since the forces
of occupation prevent the citizens from arriving at their fields, thus
threatening thousands of families to lose their source of income.




     <p> Yesterday the clashes between the belligerent occupation forces
and civilians continued, and the number of injured reached 200 in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The following lost their lives: 1. Ghassan
Yousif Salim Awaissa, 28 years old, from Ramallah, struck in the chest
by a bullet. 2. Bashir Salah Shalwit, 15 years old, from Qalqilya,
struck in the abdomen by a bullet which penetrated his right lung. 3.
Ahmad Mohammad Khalil Qasim, 25 years old, from Tulkrum, struck by
several 500 mm caliber bullets in different parts of the body. 4. Jabr
Ahmad Jabr Almishal, 23 years old, from the Shati refugee camp in
Gaza, struck by a bullet to the chest using a silencer.

     <p>AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights emphasizes that the occupation
forces intentionally use excessive and lethal force to kill the
highest possible number of Palestinian civilians. They also
intentionally and heavily target civilian property to frighten
civilians and cause the greatest possible material loss. AL-MEZAN also
emphasizes the infringement of the 4th Geneva Convention and the
principle of international and humanitarian law by the Israeli
occupation forces through committing war crimes against the
Palestinians. The commitment of such war crimes demands the immediate
intervention of the international community, especially the high
contracting parties to the Geneva Convention to stop the crimes and
present the perpetrators before the court according to the legal
bases. And demands that the necessary steps be taken to protect the
Palestinian civilians. AL-MEZAN demands that the High commission for
Human Rights of the United Nations implements the resolution
E/CN.4/S-5/L.2/Rev.1 and sets up a body to inspect the facts, and to
stop the crimes committed by the occupation forces against the
Palestinian civilians.

<p><b>Defence for Children International - Palestine Section</b></p>
<p><b> BLAMING THE VICTIM
  </b></p>




<p>Dear friends,

<p>On behalf of Defence for Children International/Palestine Section, I
am writing to request your support in countering Israeli attempts to
blame Palestinian adults for the death of Palestinian children, as
well as false accusations printed against DCI/PS in yesterday's
edition of The Jerusalem Post.  

<p>In the Opinion section of yesterday's (27 October) edition, an article
was published entitled "Child sacrifice is Palestinian paganism."  
The
article states that these children died "in the front lines, providing
cover for Palestinian militias armed with machine guns and other
weapons, seeking to overwhelm isolated Israeli guard posts."  The
article goes on to say that "The outnumbered Israeli soldiers,
defending the civilians behind these outposts, cannot see the 
children
through the small slits and openings--as was clearly the case at the
Netzarim crossing in Gaza."  

<p>Such attempts to place blame on Palestinian adults for the deaths of
Palestinian children are a clear effort to portray the Palestinian
population as sub-human and to divert attention away from the ongoing
siege against Palestinian civilians.  Moreover, they are an attempt to
excuse or justify the deaths of these children.  In addition, by
focusing on Palestinian adults and parents, other gross violations of
Palestinian children's rights are being overlooked, such as the
nightly attacks on Palestinian cities and villages, the closure of
over 30 schools and the virtual imprisonment of thousands of children
in their homes in the H2 (Israeli controlled) area of Hebron, and the
inability of approximately 13,000 Palestinian students to travel to
school as a result of the Israeli imposed closure (according to the
Palestinian Ministry of Education), and the list goes on.   

<p>In addition to asserting that Palestinian adults use Palestinian
children as human shields, the article states that:

<p> " The Palestinian branch of DCI, which is supported by donations
 designed
for protecting children, uses these funds for propaganda attacks
against Israel, while ignoring the abuses of children by the
Palestinian leadership. 

<p>"In a recent conference on the dangers of landmines that took place in
Geneva, the Palestinian members of DCI were too busy circulating
denunciations of Israel, to discuss means for cooperation in
protecting children from these dangers." 

<p>Those of you who are familiar with the work of DCI/PS know that such
claims are completely inaccurate and constitute a blatant attempt to
discredit our work on behalf of Palestinian children.  This is not the
first attempt by the article's author to call into questions DCI/PS's
credibility.  As such, we need your help immediately.

<p>We ask that you take two actions:

<p>1. Write to The Jerusalem Post and protest the blatant attempts to
dehumanize the Palestinian people and to discredit the work of DCI/PS.

DCI/PS Views with Grave Concern Attempts to Blame <br>
Palestinian Parents for the Death of their Children

<p>Defence for Children International/Palestine Section views with grave
concern current attempts to blame Palestinian adults for the deaths of
Palestinian children.  Such efforts not only skew the reality of the
present conflict, but divert attention away from the roots of the
problem: that of ongoing and systematic abuses of Palestinian human
rights resulting from the 33 year long Israeli military occupation of
Palestinian territory.

<p>According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS), as of
midnight, 26 October, 122 Palestinians have been killed and 5,252
injured, as a result of the ongoing Israeli siege against Palestinian
civilians.  Of those, DCI/PS has documented the deaths of 43
Palestinian children, with an additional 3 who have been declared
clinically dead, and the injury of over 1,000 children.  The
circumstances surrounding the deaths of these children range from
children who participated in protests against the Israeli occupation,
children who were hit with live ammunition while playing in their
backyard or walking to school, and children who were denied prompt
access to medical care.  

<p>The notion that Palestinian parents send their children to die is yet
the latest reincarnation of a well-known scapegoating strategy known
as 'blaming the victim.'  In a clear attempt to avoid Israeli
culpability for the deaths of Palestinian children, animosity or
suspicion is directed towards the victim, thereby justifying or
excusing the original violation the victim suffered.  Similar to the
battered wife who "drove" her spouse to physical abuse, Palestinian
adults are blamed for the death and injury of their children by
Israeli military forces.  No less, Palestinian parents are accused of
placing their children in dangerous situations, the implication being
that Palestinian parents do not love their children in the same way
that other parents do.  No mention is made that contact with Israeli
military forces is often unavoidable as Israeli soldiers are posted
near schools, homes, and community centers throughout the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.  In addition to the attempt to de-humanize the
Palestinian people, such an approach allows for the oversight of how
it is that these children are actually being killed and wounded.  When
attention is focused on the parents of Palestinian children, the
Israeli soldier who points his weapon and fires at the child, along
with the Israeli government that sanctions these actions, escapes all
accountability. Moreover, attention is diverted away from the
countless other Israeli violations of Palestinian children's rights,
including the closure of over 30 schools and confining thousands of
Palestinian children to their homes for days on end as a result of the
curfew imposed on the Old City in Hebron. The end result is that
Palestinians are blamed for their own victimization.

<p>Of particular concern to DCI/PS is the article "Child Sacrifice is
Palestinian paganism," published in today's edition of "The Jerusalem
Post."  In addition to asserting that Palestinian adults use children
as human shields during confrontations, the article's author states
that DCI/PS launches "propaganda attacks against Israel, while
ignoring the abuses of children by the Palestinian leadership."  As a
child-rights organization advocating, in particular, for the
implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),
we work to ensure that all parties to the present conflict act in the
best interests of the child and according to the rule of law.  With
reference to Israel, we advocate that Israel upholds its obligations
under international law, both those it has willingly assumed and those
to which it is bound through customary international law.  To date,
and in addition to numerous other violations, Israel has failed to
implement the CRC in the Occupied Territories, despite its 2 November
1991 entry into force in Israel, or to submit the required country
report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.

<p>As a child-rights organization, DCI/PS mourns the death of each of
these children. DCI/PS regrets that any child is forced to live in
violent circumstances, but the Israeli military occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip has made that an inevitable fact of life for
approximately 1.5 million Palestinian children. These conditions will
only improve upon the complete Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian
territories.

<h3>
On the 30th day of clashes:<br>
   Significant escalation of shooting by the Israeli occupation forces</h3>



<p>Today, clashes broke out between Palestinian civilians and the Israeli
occupation forces throughout the Gaza Strip.  These forces fired at
demonstrators and wounded dozens.  In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli
occupation forces continued to station themselves on several parts of
the main road between the north of the Gaza Strip and the south (Salah
El-Din Street).  They re-closed the mentioned road near Kfar Darom
settlement.

<p>At 15:30 local time, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire from
their machine guns on Palestinian civilians demonstrating near 
Al-Tuffah
roadblock between Khan Yunis city and Al-Mawasi (agricultural area).
Eight civilians were wounded.  PCHR's field officer in the area 
reported
that among the wounded were two children, one wounded in the neck and
the other in the abdomen.  The two children were evacuated to a nearby
hospital in critical condition.

<p>In Rafah, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and the
Israeli occupation forces near Salah El-Din Gate on the
Palestinian-Egyptian border, and near Tal Al-Sultan road block in the
west of the town (separating it from Al-Mawasi).  The Israeli 
occupation
forces opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators in the two areas of
clashes and wounded four of them with live ammunition, three of whom 
are
in critical condition.  PCHR's field officer in Rafah reported that the
three seriously wounded are: Mohammed Mustafa Al-Jazzar, 18 years old,
who was wounded with a live bullet in the head and was evacuated to
Shifa' hospital in Gaza; Essam Al-Moghayar, 20 years old, wounded with 
a
live bullet in the back; and Mousa Abu Jazar, 16 years old, wounded 
with
a live bullet in the back.

<p>In Khan Yunis, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces near an Israeli military post to the west
of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis and near Al-Tuffah roadblock between
Khan Yunis city and Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area. The Israeli
occupation forces opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators.  Snipers
using silencers took part.  As a result, 22 Palestinian civilians were
wounded by live ammunition, including the child Mohammed Sai'd Abu
Al-Hesein, 15 years old, who was seriously wounded by a live bullet in
the chest. PCHR's field officer reported that the Israeli occupation
forces opened fire suddenly and indiscriminately this afternoon and
wounded eight Palestinian civilians at once.  Among the wounded were 
the
child Jamal Al-Ghalban, 12 years old, who was wounded with a live 
bullet
in the abdomen, and the child Yousef Awadh Abu Tayyem, 14 years old, 
who
was wounded with a live bullet in the neck.  Additionally, eight
Palestinian civilians were wounded today with rubber-coated metal
bullets.

<p>In the vicinity of Kfar Darom settlement near Deir El-Balah, clashes
broke out this afternoon between Palestinian demonstrators and the
Israeli occupation forces.  These forces fired live ammunition,
frequently using silencers, and tear gas canisters at Palestinian
demonstrators. PCHR's field officer in the area reported that 14
Palestinian civilians were wounded by live bullets fired by the Israeli
occupation forces, four of whom were seriously wounded; they are:
Mohammed Mahmoud Al-Boheisi, 17 years old, from Deir El-Balah, wounded
with a live bullet in the abdomen; Hammam Jamal Al-Aqraa', 16 years 
old,
from Deir El-Balah, wounded with a live bullet in the left eye; and
A'atef Ahmed Nejem, 22 years old, from Al-Shati refugee camp, wounded
with a live bullet in the chest.  Additionally, three other 
Palestinians
were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets.

<p>This afternoon, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces near the area of Erez – under the control
of these forces – in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.  The Israeli
occupation forces fired live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets
at Palestinian demonstrators.  A Palestinian civilian was wounded with 
a
live bullet in the shoulder and three were wounded with rubber-coated
metal bullets.

<p>This afternoon, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces on a road used by Jewish settlers near
Karni Outlet. The Israeli occupation forces opened fire on Palestinian
demonstrators and wounded three of them with live ammunition.  The
wounded were evacuated to Shifa' hospital in Gaza.

<p>PCHR's Notes on Today's Clashes in the Gaza Strip:
<ol>
<li>There is a significant escalation of shooting at Palestinian
demonstrators by the Israeli occupation forces; 53 Palestinian 
civilians
were wounded with live ammunition and 14 wounded with rubber-coated
metal bullets.
<li>Ten of the wounded are in critical condition as they were wounded in
the head, chest and abdomen.  This provides strong evidence of a
shoot-to-kill policy adopted by the Israeli occupation forces.
<li>Eight of the seriously wounded are children of the age 12-18 years.
<li> Two of the wounded received bullets in the back.  This provides
evidence of indiscriminate shooting or targeting with the aim to kill.
<li>Eight of the wounded received bullets at once which is a clear
evidence of indiscriminate shooting by the Israeli occupation forces.
<li>The Israeli occupation forces frequently used snipers and silencers
in shooting at Palestinians.
</ol>
<p>PCHR condemns the killings and abuses perpetrated by the Israeli
occupation forces against Palestinian civilians in the occupied
Palestinian territories.  Since September 29, 2000, 127 Palestinians,
including 38 children, have been killed and more than 3,800 wounded,
some of whom are in critical condition.  PCHR warns of the continued
escalation of excessive lethal use of force by the Israeli occupation
forces, and warns particularly of the targeting of Palestinian 
children.

<p>PCHR reiterates its call to the international community and the High
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to immediately
intervene to halt serious abuses and killings perpetrated by the 
Israeli
occupation forces against Palestinian civilians.  In addition, these
parties should intervene to stop the continued attacks on Palestinian
land and property.  PCHR calls for providing international protection
for Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories as it
is the only way to stop the Israeli occupation forces' crimes and to
prevent further deterioration of the situation.

<h3>Four Palestinian civilians killed in today's clashes:
             Israeli occupation forces fire at a deaf child
</h3>


<p>This afternoon, the Israeli occupation forces escalated their criminal
acts and abuses against Palestinian civilians who continued their
protests throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.  The Israeli
occupation forces fired live ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets,
and tear gas canisters at Palestinian demonstrators.  As a result, four
Palestinian civilians, including a 15-year-old deaf child, were killed
and dozens, including a number of children, wounded in the head, chest
and abdomen.  The Israeli occupation forces have continued to reinforce
their positions between Palestinian cities and in points of friction
with Palestinian civilians.  In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupation
forces continued to sweep Palestinian agricultural land; they have 
swept
an area of 847 donums so far throughout the Gaza Strip.  The Israeli
occupation forces have stationed tanks and armored vehicles on the main
road between the north of the Gaza Strip and its south (Salah El-Din
street), and have established military roadblocks on the mentioned 
road.

<p>This afternoon, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces near the area of Erez – under the control
of these forces – in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.  The Israeli
occupation forces fired live ammunition, sometimes using silencers, at
Palestinian demonstrators and killed Jaber Ahmed Jaber Al-Meshal, 23
years old, from Al-Shati refugee camp, with a bullet in the chest.
Additionally, 18 civilians were wounded by live ammunition and two
wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets.

<p>In Khan Yunis, clashes broke out this afternoon between Palestinian
demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces near an Israeli 
military
post to the west of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis and near Al-Tuffah
roadblock between Khan Yunis city and Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area,
which has been under a strict Israeli military siege since the 
beginning
of this month.  PCHR's field officer reported that nine Palestinian
civilians were wounded by live ammunition and 25 wounded by
rubber-coated metal bullets.  Additionally, more than 30 Palestinian
civilians, including some children, suffered from fainting and asphyxia
due to inhaling tear gas.

<p>In Rafah, clashes broke out this morning between Palestinian
demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces near Salah El-Din Gate
on the Palestinian-Egyptian border, and near Tal Al-Sultan road block 
in
the west of the town, separating it from Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area.
PCHR's field officer in Rafah reported that the Israeli occupation
forces opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators in the two areas of
clashes and wounded seven of them with live ammunition and another two
with rubber-coated metal bullets, including Asa'd Jamil Al-Leddawi, 18
years old, who was hit by one of these bullets in his eye.

<p>In Qalqilya, this afternoon, clashes broke out between Palestinian
demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces.  These forces opened
fire on Palestinian demonstrators and killed a deaf 15-year-old child,
Bashir Saleh Shalawi, with several bullets to the abdomen.

<p>In Tulkarm, the Israeli occupation forces fired at Palestinian
demonstrators and killed Ahmed Mohammed Qassem, 25 years old, with
several medium caliber bullets in several parts of his body.

<p>In Ramallah, the Israeli occupation forces fired at Palestinian
demonstrators and killed Ghassan Yousef Awaisa, 26 years old, from
Al-Zhahirya and resident of Ramallah, with a bullet in the chest.  This
evening, the Israeli occupation forces' tanks shelled some 
neighborhoods
of Ramallah, causing severe damage to a number of buildings.

<p>PCHR has learned that similar clashes broke out this afternoon in
Jenin.  The Israeli occupation forces fired at demonstrators and 
wounded
the child Fadi Amin Al-Harioush, 15 years old, with a live bullet in 
the
head.  The child was evacuated to Jenin hospital and then to Nablus
hospital in critical condition.  Additionally, eight Palestinian
civilians were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets and dozens were
hurt due to inhaling tear gas in these clashes.

<p>In Nablus, the Israeli occupation forces and Jewish settlers continued
to attack Palestinian civilians.  Yesterday evening and this morning,
Jewish settlers fired at Palestinian civilians in the village of Hares
while they were cultivating olives.  Seven Palestinians were wounded.

<p>In Hebron, clashes broke out between the Israeli occupation forces and
Jewish settlers on one side and Palestinian demonstrators on the other
side, specially, in El-Shalla street, El-Takrouri neighborhood and the
refugee camp of Al-Fawwar.  A number of Palestinian civilians were
wounded in these clashes.

<p>The Israeli occupation forces have reinforced their presence on the 
main
road between the north of the Gaza Strip and its south (Salah El-Din
street) at the following points:<ol>
<li>The entrance of a branch road leading to Morag settlement in the
east and the entrance of a road leading to Gush Qatif settlement block
(Rafah).
 <li> Gush Qatif junction and the entrance to Kissufim (Khan Yunis).
 <li> Near Kfar Darom settlement (the middle area of the Gaza Strip).
</ol>
<p>Early this morning, the Israeli occupation forces swept a three-donum
area of agricultural land planted with vegetables as well as olive,
guava and palm trees.  The swept tract of land is owned by the heirs of
the deceased Mezyed Zeidan Dhoheir.  The Israeli occupation forces'
bulldozers also destroyed an agricultural pool and irrigation networks.
Yesterday evening, the Israeli occupation forces' bulldozers swept a
seven-donum area of agricultural land, planted with citrus trees and
owned by Fuad Al-Ja'farawi, in the vicinity of Kfar Darom settlement.

<p>PCHR condemns the killings and abuses perpetrated by the Israeli
occupation forces since September 29 in the occupied Palestinian
territories which have resulted in the deaths of 127 Palestinians,
including 38 children.  More than 3,600 Palestinians have been wounded.
Many of these casualties are in critical condition.

<p>PCHR asserts that Israel's efforts to reinforce the position of its
occupation forces between Palestinian cities and at points of frictions
adjacent to Palestinian residential areas as well as the continued
attacks by Jewish settlers against Palestinian civilians in the 
occupied
Palestinian territories are a source of permanent threat to the 
security
and safety of Palestinian civilians.

<p>PCHR reiterates its call to the international community and the High
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to immediately
intervene to halt serious abuses and killings perpetrated by the 
Israeli
occupation forces against Palestinian civilians.  In addition, these
parties should intervene to stop the continued attacks on Palestinian
land and property.  PCHR calls for providing international protection
for Palestinian civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories, as 
it
is the only way to stop the Israeli occupation forces' crimes and to
prevent further deterioration of the situation.

<p><b>Canadian statement of NGOs</b></p>
<h3>Canadian NGOs Urge the Government to Protect 
Palestinians
</h3>



<p>Like many Canadians we are deeply troubled by the violence that broke 
out in
the Middle East in late September 2000, and we deplore the violence on 
both
sides and grieve the human loss of both Palestinians and Israelis.  By 
now,
two weeks later, over 100 people have been killed; another 3000 have 
been
injured; physical infrastructure has been destroyed, and much good will 
has
been lost.

<p>It must be noted, however, that over 90% of the deaths and injuries 
have
been Palestinian and 20% of these have been civilian children, among 
them
the 12-year old Mohamed Jamal Al-Dourra who died in the arms of his 
father
near an Israeli settlement in Gaza. This heavy Palestinian death toll
reflects the fact that Israel has used sophisticated weapons while the
Palestinians have relied mainly on demonstrations and throwing stones, 
using
other weapons in only a very limited way. This disproportionate and
excessive use of lethal force by Israel, as an occupying power, 
contravenes
the Fourth Geneva Convention and must be condemned.

<p>We believe the fundamental reason behind the outbreak of violence is 
the
impasse in the peace process which the Palestinians see, correctly, as
failing to meet the minimum standards of justice. Since 1993, when the
current process began, the Palestinians' social and economic situation 
has
deteriorated substantially, while the number of Israeli settlers in the
occupied territories has doubled to over 200,000. Israel has also 
increased
its network of by-pass roads and its claim on the water and other 
resources
from these territories. These and other developments reflect Israel's 
basic
refusal to accept the relevant UN resolutions, particularly those that
demand an end to its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

<p>In light of this situation, we commend the Canadian government for its
support for UN resolution 1322 which affirms, "that a just and lasting 
peace
solution to the Arab and Israeli conflict must be based on its 
resolutions
242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, 
through an
active negotiating process". These UN resolutions constitute the only 
basis
on which to negotiate a sustainable peace settlement. By and large
Palestinians have accepted this framework as a basis for coexisting 
with
Israel. Implementing that framework means:
<ol>
<li> Ending the Israeli occupation over the occupied territories, 
including
East Jerusalem
<li>Establishing a "normal" Palestinian state with sovereignty over
borders and natural resources
<li>The right of return of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
forced into exile by the conflict since 1948.
</ol>
<p>There is nothing extremist in these demands. Their legitimacy is 
established
in numerous international instruments, which have been discussed and
approved time and again by the vast majority of the international 
community.
Israel, with American support, has moved the negotiations away from 
these
principles.

<p>In the current context, we urge the Canadian government to:
<ol>
<li> Provide a framework for a solution through a process of implementing 
a
just peace founded on UN Resolutions and other legitimate international
agreements.
<li>Press Israel to stop military operations and attacks against unarmed
civilians in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention.
<li> Coordinate and consult with the European Union and Arab States to 
define
a framework for a just and lasting peace based on international law.</ol>
