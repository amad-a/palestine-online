<h3>Palestinian Academics and Activists</h3>
<p><b>AN URGENT STATEMENT TO THE ISRAELI PUBLIC.    November
2000
</b></p>


          <p> In February of this year, we, a group of Palestinian
academics and activists, addressed an urgent call to the Israeli
public.
We expressed in it our fear that the Oslo peace process, as it had
evolved
over the past seven years, was inevitably leading to further
conflict--perhaps even war--rather than to our hoped-for goal: a final
historic reconciliation that would enable our two peoples to live in
peace, human dignity and neighborly relations.

          <p> We expressed our concern that the Oslo accords have
been used
by Israel, despite claims to the contrary, to create unprecedented
expansion of settlements, almost double the settler population, and
continue the expropriation of Palestinian land. Freedom of
movement for
Palestinians
has been severely curtailed while settler violence against our
communities
continues without restraint. Against this background, the
Palestinian
population has had no physical, legal or political means of
protection.

         <p>  While military occupation is a palpable reality that affects
us every day, it has been disguised under Oslo in ways that negate
international law and the protection it might afford. We now live in a
series of small disconnected areas which are being posited as the
emerging
Palestinian
state. The only way to expand these Bantustans according to the
distorted
logic
which has dominated negotiations, is for the Palestinian leadership
to
make concessions which would legitimize a number of Israeli
demands in
contravention to international law: to concede our national rights to
East
Jerusalem, allow settlements to remain in occupied territory and
renounce
the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

          <p> The Israeli leadership (be it Likud or Labor) has continued
to imagine that, given the massive military balance of force in its
favor,
it would be able to impose on the Palestinian Authority its unjust
vision
of a final settlement, and pretend that the conflict is resolved in the
eyes of the world. This delusion that a deeply unjust agreement
can be
made by Israel with
President Yasser Arafat alone, who is then expected to force his
people
into accepting it, is profoundly shortsighted and has inevitably led to
the critical situation that confronts us now.

          <p> Many of us were in the streets over these recent weeks,
holding neither guns nor stones. We were holding candles to
commemorate
the
deaths of our students, neighbors and relatives who tried to make
the
world hear with their lives what we were unable to with our words.
The
na√Øve and dangerous notion that Palestinians took to the streets
following Yasser Arafat's orders is not only an insult to our
intelligence
but also a clear sign of the lack of understanding of the reality in
which
we live.

          <p> We are deeply concerned that the conflict has, at times,
dangerously spiraled, into an ethnic/religious one, as the pogroms
against
Arab citizens of
Nazareth, the lynching of the two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah and
the
numerous mob attacks on synagogues and mosques have shown.
The profoundly
irresponsible and self-serving act of the Barak government in
allowing
Ariel Sharon onto the Haram al Sharif shows not just an alarming
lack of
judgment, but also a total disregard for Palestinian, Arab and
Muslim
sensibilities.  The use of live ammunition against unarmed
Palestinian
civilians at demonstrations there the next day and at protests ever
since,
shows total contempt for Palestinian life.

          <p> The stubborn and escalating use of Israel's overwhelming
military
power in order to crush the current uprising and terrify the
Palestinian
population into submission shows a dangerous, willful refusal to
address
its
underlying causes. Military might may be able to subdue the
current wave
of protest -- at the immediate cost of many lives. But in the long
run, it
cannot stem the will of a people seeking their just and rightful place
in the world. It will also condemn us to re-visit the current crisis
again
and
again.

         <p>  All of us are firm believers in an equitable and just
negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians that
recognizes the
right to self-determination. However we, like our communities, have
lost
hope in the possibility of resolving the current inequities in the
framework of the Oslo agreements and the exclusive American
'brokerage' of
the process. We believe that we must find an equitable basis for
peace
which must necessarily take the following broad principles as a
point of
departure:

            <p>  1.Negotiations must be based on the principles that all
the lands occupied by Israel in 1967 are, in fact, occupied territories
and
that peace will be only be achieved by ending the occupation of
these
territories and thus enabling Palestinians to exercise their right to
self-determination and sovereignty.
             <p> 2.East Jerusalem is part of these Palestinian territories
occupied by Israel in 1967. Consequently, a final settlement must
include Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the
commitment
to
Jerusalem as the recognized capital of two states.
             <p> 3.Israel's recognition of its responsibility in the
creation of the Palestinian refugees in 1948 is a pre-requisite to
finding
a just and lasting resolution of the refugee problem in accordance
with
relevant United Nations resolutions.
            <p>  4.Both sides must recognize the spiritual and historical
affinities of each other to sites and locations within their own
borders
and they must affirm and guarantee the access and protection of
the
other
people to these places within their own borders. But in neither case
should the existence of such sites be used to advance extra-
territorial
claims to locations within each other's borders.

          <p> We believe that the implementation of these principles will
provide for a just and therefore, genuine and lasting peace. The
hoped-for co-existence between our two peoples can only become
possible if
a
reconstructed peace settlement is equitable. This requires moral
recognition of the historic injustice visited upon Palestinians. Peace
and
co-existence will not be accomplished by imposing an unjust
settlement
that goes
against the will of the people. <p>This land is destined to be the home
of
our two
peoples. The need for a solution based on mutual respect and
accommodation is dictated not only by the search for security and
stability,
but also by the quest for freedom and prosperity of future
generations.
It is our hope that, out of the tragedies of recent weeks, a new and
fair
vision of peace can emerge between the two peoples.

<p><b>Israeli occupation forces kill six civilians in less than 24 hours:
New cold-blooded killing at Gush Qatif junction
</b></p>


<p>In a new serious escalation of the use of lethal force against
Palestinian civilians, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire on a
Palestinian civilian car on Salah El-Din Street (the main road between
the north and south of the Gaza Strip), near a junction leading to Gush
Qatif settlement block, killing two persons.  The Israeli occupation
forces closed the mentioned road and prevented the entry of ambulances
into the area.  The closure coincided with the passing vehicle of the 
UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, when she was
returning from her visit to Rafah.  She was also prevented from
proceeding on her way to Gaza City.

<p>In the area of Beit Hanoun (Erez) Checkpoint, the Israeli occupation
forces shot at Palestinian demonstrators, killing one with a live 
bullet
in the heart.  In Hebron, the Israeli occupation forces shot at a young
man this evening in an area that did not witness any clashes, killing
him with a live bullet in the chest.  In Jenin, a Palestinian young man
succumbed this morning to an injury incurred yesterday from a live
bullet in the head shot by the Israeli occupation forces.  On the 44th
day of clashes, which started on September 29, 2000, the number of
Palestinians killed by the Israeli occupation forces increased to 179,
including 58 children.  More sweeping of agricultural land took place
today.

<p> 1. Shots Fired at a Palestinian Civilian Car Kill Its Occupants:

<p>At about 12:20 p.m. local time, the Israeli occupation forces opened
fire on a civilian car travelling on Salah El-Din Street (the main road
between the north and west of the Gaza Strip), near the junction 
leading
to Gush Qatif settlement block.  Eyewitnesses stated that shooting was
heard in the area five minutes before the passing of the mentioned
civilian car, and such shooting stopped for several minutes.  Then,
intense shooting was heard.  Later, it was clear that shooting targeted
a civilian car, a blue-colored Delta.  Immediately after that, Israeli
occupation troops, reinforced with tanks and jeeps, were abundantly
deployed in the area, closing Salah El-Din Street.  These forces
prevented an ambulance of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society from
entering the area to evacuate the persons who were in the car.  PCHR's
field officer in the area reported that he filmed some of the area
immediately after the incident took place.  He added that the Israeli
occupation forces did not allow the evacuation of the wounded who
remained in the car until 13:21 local time, when two corpses were
removed from the car using a crane.  The Israeli occupation forces put
the two corpses alongside the road and then destroyed the car,
apparently to hide any evidence that might refute their pretenses
concerning the crime.  PCHR's field officer added that he saw the
evacuation of the corpses and the destruction of the car from a 
distance
of 60 meters, and that the Israeli occupation forces did not get out 
any
military equipment or any weapons.  This absolutely proves that the
victims were civilians and they had no relation with any kind of
shooting.  PCHR's field officer also saw the Israeli occupation forces
cutting the clothes of the two martyrs, refusing to hand their bodies
over to the Palestinian side.  The two martyrs were moved to an unknown
place.  Later in the day the Palestinian side received the bodies of 
the
two martyrs.  The martyrs are:
<p>1) Mohammed Yassin Darwish El-Madhoun, 25 years old, from Al-Shati
refugee camp in Gaza, who received heavy bullets throughout the body;
and
<p>2) Monther Hamdi Yssin, 25 years old, from Al-Shati refugee camp in
Gaza, who received heavy bullets throughout the body.

<p>PCHR condemns this terrible crime which is to be added to the long
record of crimes and cold-blooded killings perpetrated by the Israeli
occupation forces.  PCHR refers to a similar incident that took place 
on
September 9, 2000, when the Israeli occupation forces opened fire on 
two
civilian cars, passing on Salah El-Din Street, near the settlement of
Kfar Darom, near Deir El-Balah.  As a result, E'etedal Hamza Moa'mmar,
29 years old, was killed and her infant son Mohammed, 6 months, was
seriously wounded.  Her other child, Rae'd, 4 years old, and her
husband, Sharif E'id Moa'mmar, 37 years old, were moderately wounded.
Another civilian car was also hit with bullets fired by the Israeli
occupation forces.  As a result, Saleh Mahmoud Saleh, was wounded with 
a
live bullet in the thigh.  As usual, the Israeli occupation forces
claimed that shots were fired in their direction.  Later, it was clear
that the two targeted cars were civilian vehicles.

<p> 2. Shooting at Demonstrators in the Areas of Clashes:

<p>In the aftermath of shooting by the Israeli occupation forces on the
civilian car near Gush Qatif junction, tension spread over the area.  
At
about 14:20 local time, shooting was heard.  The Israeli occupation
forces were seen shooting at Palestinians who gathered in the area,
wounding:
<p>1) Ahmed Hassan Yousef Dahlan, 18 years old, from Khan Yunis, 
critically
with a live bullet in the head;
<p>2) Mohammed Ibrahim Al-Najjar, 18 years old, with a live bullet in the
foot; and
<p>3) Abdel-Wahab Ahmed Hssan Abu Than, 47 years old, a member of the
Palestinian National Security, with a live bullet in the back, when he
was at the service post in the area.  His wound in the back proves that
he was not participating in shooting at the Israeli occupation forces.
The three were evacuated to Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.

<p>This afternoon, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces near Al-Tuffah roadblock between Khan
Yunis city and Al-Mawasi (agricultural) area, under the security 
control
of the Israeli occupation forces. These forces shot at Palestinian
demonstrators, wounding two with live ammunition and another one with a
rubber coated metal bullet.  Among the wounded is the child Bassem
Mattar El-Faqa'awi, 13 years old, who was wounded with a live bullet in
the abdomen, and was evacuated to Shifa' hospital in Gaza.

<p>In the vicinity of Beit Hanoun (Erez) Checkpoint, at the northern end 
of
the Gaza Strip, clashes have broken out between Palestinian
demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces since the morning.  The
Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian demonstrators from a
distance of more than 100 meters, killing the child Bassel Hussein Abu
Qamar, 15 years old, from Jabalya, with a live bullet in the heart.
PCHR's field officer in the area reported that another eight 
Palestinian
civilians were wounded with live ammunition.

<p>This afternoon, in the area near Al-Mentar (Karni) Outlet, to the east
of Gaza City, clashes broke out between Palestinian demonstrators and
the Israeli occupation forces which reinforced their presence in the
area with tanks and jeeps.  These forces shot at Palestinian
demonstrators from a distance of about 150 meters, wounding two with
live ammunition.

<p>In Rafah, clashes broke out this afternoon between Palestinian
demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces near Salah El-Din Gate
on the Palestinian-Egyptian border. PCHR's field officer in Rafah
reported that the Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian
demonstrators, wounding two with live ammunition, including the child
Ahmed Abu A'mra, 12 years old, who was wounded in the shoulder.

<p>At about 17:45 local time, the Israeli occupation forces shot at Munib
Mohammed Barakat Abu Monshar, 18 years old, from Hebron, killing him
with a live bullet in the right side of the chest, which penetrated his
lung and then his heart.  According to eyewitnesses, the incident took
place in the area of Bab Al-Zaweya in the area under the control of the
Palestinian National Authority in Hebron, and the martyr was unloading 
a
truck loaded with construction materials when he was shot.  Moreover,
there were no clashes in the area at that time.

<p>In Jenin, Hani Abdullah Marzouq, 35 years old, died from his injury in
the head, when the Israeli occupation forces shot at Palestinian
demonstrators yesterday.  In addition, clashes broke out today in
several areas in the West Bank, especially in Hebron, Tulkarm, Al-Bireh
and Jenin.  PCHR learned that 29 Palestinian civilians were wounded by
live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets, and dozens suffered
from suffocation due to inhaling tear gas.

<p> 3. Shelling of Civilian Buildings and Facilities:
