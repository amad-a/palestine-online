<b>Report on Settlers' Attacks on Palestinians During the Uprising 
December 30, 2000 -January 6, 2001 </b>

<p>
Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip have been steadily increasing in the past few weeks. These 
settlers have generally acted with impunity, as the Israeli military 
and court system historically have been reluctant to arrest, try, and 
punish settlers for violence they commit against Palestinian 
civilians. As a result, settlers are virtually free to carry out 
intimidation, assaults against people and property, and even murder 
against the Palestinian population. 
<p>
The existence of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories 
violates both international law and particular international 
agreements Israel is signed on. According to Article 49 of the fourth 
Geneva Convention it is prohibited to transfer civilians of an 
occupying power to the territory occupied. 
<p>
Since the Oslo accord in 1993, the number of settlers in the West Bank 
and Gaza has doubled to 200,000, not including approximately 200,000 
settlers now living in East Jerusalem. The building during Barak's 
government has actually escalated, with 14,000 settlers added and 
tenders issued for building 4,000 units last year alone, compared with 
3,000 units a year built under Netanyahu. Compared to 1999, in the 
year 2000 there has been a 96% increase in settlement building. 
<p>
Israel has continually expropriated large amounts of land from 
Palestinians for the settlement of Jewish civilians, in order to 
change the demography of the area and create irreversible facts on the 
ground. 
<p>
The AIC has been monitoring settler violence, and now introduces a 
regular updated report.
