<p><b>The Massacre Continues: <br>
159 killed and thousands wounded, destruction of property and 
collective punishments against the Palestinian civilians 
</b></p>




<p>Today, 5/11/2000 at about 12:00 noon, the belligerent Israeli 
Occupation Forces opened fire at Palestinian demonstrators. As a 
result 16-year old Palestinian child, Mahir Mohammad Assaeedi, 
resident of Albureij refugee camp was killed after being shot in the 
head. Till now, the Israelis have killed at least 159 Palestinians and 
injured thousands others. In this context, the belligerent Israeli 
Occupation Forces continued their use of excessive and lethal forces 
against the Palestinian civilians. 
<p>On the other hand, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces 
continued to shell the Palestinian civilians and their properties in 
all the areas throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Tanks and 
missiles have been used to shell Rafah, Khan-Younis, Hebron, 
Bethlehem, and Beit Jala. As a result many houses and greenhouses have 
been damaged. 
<p>Moreover, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces continued 
imposing collective punishments against the Palestinian civilians in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In this context, the Israelis 
continue to besiege the Palestinian Territories as a whole, separating 
them from the rest of the world, on one hand. On the other hand, they 
continue to besiege the Palestinian cities, separating them from each 
other. This situation absolutely prevents the freedom of movement of 
individuals. The (Special UN Coordinator) office in Gaza estimates the 
daily Palestinian loss resulting from the Israeli closure by $US 9 
million. 
<p>The Israelis have been closing the international airport of Gaza 
since 31/10/2000. This is the third time the Israelis close this 
airport since the beginning of Alaqsa intifadhah /uprising. The 
closure of the airport prevents the arrival of humanitarian aid 




sent to the Palestinian Territories and hinders the transfer of the 
injured to hospitals abroad. 
<p>Additional Palestinian losses resulted from the destruction of 
properties and industrial premises. Based on the data available to the 
field- work unit of AL-MEZAN Center for human rights, 197.5 Donums 
owned by Palestinian civilians in Gaza strip have been cleared since 
29/9/2000. Besides, 129 houses in Gaza Strip have been, either totally 
or partially, damaged during the same period. Moreover 14 mosques and 
one temple for the Samiri cult have been attacked in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip during the same period. 

<p>The Israeli continuation to commit anti humanitarian and war crimes 
against the Palestinian civilians, protected by the 4th Geneva 
Convention, ascertains more than any earlier time, the need to provide 
protection for the civilian Palestinians. This is a legal request that 
should not submit to or be influenced by political considerations. 
AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights welcomes Mrs. Mary Robinson, the 
high UN commissioner on human rights, who will visit the Palestinian 
Territories next week. In this context AL-MEZAN hopes that she will; 
as has always demonstrated, make every effort to support the 
Palestinian victims. We hope that she will make use of the respect, 
appreciation and position she enjoys among the international community 
to provide protection for the Palestinian civilians, and urge the 
international community to chase the Israeli war criminals and bring 
them to trial. 
<p>Previous experiences during the last few years the human rights 
were 
sacrificed under the pressure of political considerations. As a 
result, Palestinians were killed and their properties destroyed. In 
the light of this, we at AL-MEZAN hope that this visit will be the 
starting point of a special UN position/ role that does not submit to 
political considerations.
