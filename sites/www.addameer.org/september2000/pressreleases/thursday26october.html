<p><b> Israel Attempts to Provoke Religious Discrimination Between Palestinian
Christians and Muslims </b></p>





<p>The Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and
Democracy (MIFTAH) views with serious alarm the recent Israeli attempts to
provoke religious discrimination between Palestinian Christians and Muslims,
through inaccurate and distorted media reports.

<p>The Israeli Jerusalem Post newspaper published an article on Wednesday
25/10/2000 in which it states that "Šsince the outbreak of violence in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, hundreds of Christian Arab families have left with
the assistance of the [Israeli] Foreign Ministry and foreign embassies, such
as those of England, Canada, and Cyprus." The article continues by falsely
asserting that Palestinian Christian families felt threatened after a Muslim
preacher in Gaza made hostile remarks against the Christian community there.

<p>In accordance with the information provided to MIFTAH by primary sources
from the embassies concerned, the report is inaccurate. All three embassies
have stated that they are concerned solely with the fact that any person of
their citizenship living in Israel or the Occupied Territories is their
responsibility, whether Muslim, Jewish, or Christian. The embassies carried
out their protocol procedure of publicly announcing to their citizens the
arrangements for evacuation, should they wish to do so.

<p>To that end, MIFTAH cautions against this shortsighted attempt to induce a
false sense of discrimination within Palestinian society, and provoke
religious tensions between the Palestinian Christians and Muslims.

<p>Throughout their history, the Palestinian people have unquestionably
demonstrated a strong sense of unity under one just cause, and therefore
take pride in maintaining a secular society based on the principles of
justice, freedom, and pluralism.

<p>Official responses from the Palestinian Christian community emphasized that
Christian Palestinians share an integral part of the Palestinian national
struggle for independence and sovereignty.

<p><b> B¹Tselem: Lift the Prolonged Curfew on Hebron and Hawara
  </b></p>




<p>For the past several weeks, the IDF has imposed a curfew on 44,000
Palestinians in Hebron and Hawara. As a result, thousands of families and
their children are confined to their homes for days and weeks on end. The
prolonged curfew harms all aspects of life for this large civilian
population, and constitutes a collective punishment, forbidden under
international law.

<p>· Hebron: In Area H2, which remains under Israeli security control, an
uninterrupted curfew has been in force since the beginning of October for
the 40,000 Palestinians living in the area. The curfew does not apply to the
hundreds of Israeli settlers living in H2. As a result of the curfew, 34
schools are closed. Three of these schools have been taken over by the IDF
and turned into military bases: the Ma¹aref school, Usama bin Munkez, and
the Johar school.

<p>· Hawara: In this village of 4,000 near Nablus, curfew has been in effect
intermittently since 6 October. The IDF took over two rooftops and
established outposts on them: the homes of the family of Kheiri Salim Hamus
and Ali Musa. The prolonged curfew at this time of year, prevents the
residents from harvesting olives, which is a primary source of income.

<p>Thousands of Palestinians, including children, suffer from the effects of
the prolonged curfew: a shortage of food and other essential supplies, harm
to health services and ambulances, loss of employment and sources of income,
and lack of regular garbage collection.

<p>B¹Tselem calls on the IDF to lift the curfew on Hebron and Hawara and enable
the civilian population to return to normal life.

</b></p>

<b>Lobby for International Protection for the Palestinian People</b>

<p>Background:<br>
- Resolutions of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR)<br>
- United States Voting Record in the UNCHR


<p>The violent Israeli repression of the most recent Palestinian
uprising ("Al-Alqsa Intifada") has resulted in a renewed Palestinian
call for international protection of the Palestinian people, i. e. an
effective intervention by the United Nations aimed at enforcing
abidance with international humanitarian and human rights standards
both in the historical conflict and in the future search for a
solution. The Palestinian call for international protection reflects
a growing concern and consensus about the fact that the failure of
the seven-year-old Oslo "peace process" is a direct result of the
deliberate sidelining of international rights standards and the
United Nations.

<p>Recently, the fifth Special Session of the UN Commission on Human
Rights (CHR), the main human rights body in the United Nations, re-
affirmed the validity of Palestinian-Arab concerns and claims;
Resolution E/CN.4/S-5/L.2/Rev.1, adopted on 19 October 2000 (see
reference below), established an international commission of inquiry
into Israeli war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other
violations of human rights. This resolution was consequently welcomed
and adopted by the Extraordinary Summit of Arab States held in Cairo
on 21-22 October.

<p>A sustained and concerted effort by experts, human rights activists,
and lobbyists for Palestinian rights is required in order to re-
establish the role of international law and United Nations mechanisms
in the quest for just and durable solutions of the Israeli-
Palestinian/Arab conflict. One of the first and most obvious
obstacles to overcome is the deep and widespread public ignorance and
misinformation about existing international standards applicable to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a situation which is a direct
result of the marginalization of the United Nations system in all
Israel- and United States-led "peace efforts" in the Middle East.
Future public awareness raising for Palestinian rights and the need
for international protection of the Palestinian people should be
based on UN resolutions, especially resolutions of the UN Commission
on Human Rights, and highlight the role of Israel's supporters -
foremost the United States - in persistently voting against the
application of international human rights standards to the
Palestinian case.


<p>1. UN Commission on Human Rights: RESOLUTIONS on ISRAELI OCCUPATION
and RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE (Survey)

<p>Israel's occupation has been determined as:

<p>a) A Violation of the UN Charter, 4th Geneva Conventions, and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
The CHR Resolution of 19 October 2000 reaffirms that Israel's
military occupation is  a violation of the UN Charter, the Fourth
Geneva Conventions (12 August 1949) and their 1977 Protocols, and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This framework has been
reaffirmed by the CHR since the early 1970s. (CHR Res. No. 3 XXVII,
22 March 1972, Res. No. 2 XXXII, 13 February 1976, a.o.)

<p>b) War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity:
The CHR Resolution of 19 October 2000 reaffirms that Israeli
violations in the 1967 occupied territories are war crimes. The
Commission first recognized Israel's systematic and grave breaches of
the Fourth Geneva Conventions as war crimes in 1972 (CHR Res. No. 3
(XXVIII), 22 March 1972, a.o.)

<p>c) A threat to international peace and security (Chapter VII
intervention):
In 1976 the Commission reaffirmed that Israel's military occupation
of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, was a
threat to international peace and security. In 1984, the Commission
issued its first of several requests to the UN General Assembly,
through the Economic and Social Council, to recommend to the UN
Security Council the adoption against Israel of the measures referred
to in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, including
sanctions and international armed intervention to end Israel's threat
to peace and acts of aggression (CHR Res. No. 1984/1 A/B; 20 February
1984).

<p>The Commission has, moreover, reaffirmed the LEGITIMACY of
RESTISTANCE to ISRAEL'S OCCUPATION and the inalienable right of the
Palestinian people, along with the peoples of Namibia, South Africa
and Zimbabwe, and of all peoples under colonial or alien domination
or foreign occupation to self-determination, national independence,
territorial integrity, national unity, and sovereignty without
external interference. (CHR Res. No. 3 XXXIV, 14 February 1978). The
Commission also reaffirmed the legitimacy of struggle against
occupation by all available means, including armed struggle. (CHR
Res. No. 3 XXXV, 21 February 1979). This included recognition of the
intifada as a legitimate means of resistance. (CHR Res. No. 1989/19,
6 March 1989).

<p>Finally, the Commission on Human Rights has declared that ALL PEACE
AGREEMENTS that VIOLATE PALESTINIAN RIGHTS (including the right to
return) are NULL AND VOID. In response to the first (1982) Camp David
Agreement, the CHR issued the following resolution:
"[The Commission on Human Rights] Reaffirms the inalienable right of
the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which
they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return in
the exercise of their right to self-determination;
...
<p>Rejects those provisions of the [Camp David] accords which ignore,
infringe upon, violate or deny the inalienable rights of the
Palestinian people, including the right of return, the right to self-
determination and the right to national independence and sovereignty
in Palestine, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,
and which envisage and condone continued Israeli occupation of the
Palestinian territories and other Arab territories occupied by Israel
since 1967;
Strongly condemns all partial agreements and separate treaties which
constitute a flagrant violation of the rights of the Palestinian
people, the principles of the Charter and the resolutions adopted in
the various international forums on the Palestinian issue;
Declares that the Camp David accords and other agreements have no
validity in so far as they purport to determine the future of the
Palestinian people and of the Palestinian territories occupied by
Israel since 1967;" (CHR Res. No. 2 XXXVI, 14 February 1980)
Following the beginning of the Madrid/Oslo process the Commission
once again reaffirmed the necessity that all agreements be consistent
with relevant UN Resolutions and international law. (CHR Res. No.
1192/4, 14 February 1992).


<p>2. The UNITED STATES VOTING RECORD in the Commission on Human Rights

<p>United States claims to be an "honest broker" in the negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinian people are clearly refuted by its
voting record in the CHR. In resolutions on the Middle East adopted
by the Commission between 1968 and 1998, the US voted 79 times (7
votes only recorded by number in favor/against, though voting pattern
indicates the vote against the particular resolution was cast by the
US) against resolutions pertaining to the human rights of the
Palestinian people. The US voted in favor of only 10 resolutions over
the 30 year period, 6 of which were adopted without vote in the
Commission, and 2 adopted unanimously. The two remaining votes in
favor concerned resolutions expressing support for the Madrid/Oslo
peace process. The US abstained from a total of 5 resolutions.

<p>The United States voted against resolutions deploring the denial of
the right of return, deportation, confiscation of Palestinian land,
settlement construction, desecration of religious sites, torture,
beating of pregnant women causing miscarriage, closing of
kindergartens and schools, and the applicability of the Fourth Geneva
Convention, the UN Charter, and international law. In particular, the
US voted against Resolution No. 1983/3, 15 February 1983 condemning
the massacre of Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila refugee camps and
Resolution No. 1987/2 A/B, 20 February 1987 condemning Israel's "iron
fist" policy to break the bones of children throwing stones during
the first intifada.

<p>In the Economic and Social Council, the UN body which may initiate
studies and reports concerning international economic, social,
cultural, educational, health and related matters and submit
recommendations for promoting observance of human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all, the United States has voted against the
majority of resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian people. This
includes resolutions calling for the lifting of restrictions and
provision of assistance to the Palestinian economy, freedom of
movement for Palestinians, and calling upon Israel to comply with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international law.

<p><b>UNRWA </b>

   <p><b>  Middle East tensions dominate discussion of work of UNRWA at UN</b>

    <p> The past four weeks of tension and conflict in the Middle East
     dominated the opening in New York on Thursday of the annual debate
in
     a key United Nations body on the work of the United Nations Relief
and
     Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

      <p>The Commissioner-General of UNRWA, Mr. Peter Hansen, introducing
his
     annual report to the General Assembly's Special Political and
     Decolonization Committee, highlighted the humanitarian role played
by
     UNRWA, saying that the Agency's work had gone on, though with
     increased difficulty, during the recent turmoil. Virtually all of
the
     11 delegations that spoke on the opening day of the debate paid
     tribute to the dedication of UNRWA's staff and underlined the
vital
     need for a continuation of the Agency's regular and emergency
services
     for 3.7 million Palestine refugees.

     <p> Mr. Hansen said the recent crisis demonstrated anew "the depth of
     feelings aroused by the continuing absence of a solution to the
     Palestine question" and that at the heart of that issue were the
     people whom UNRWA had served for 50 years, the Palestine refugees.

     "UNRWA works among the refugees," Mr. Hansen said, noting that 99
per
     cent of the Agency's staff were Palestinians themselves. "In
periods
     of strife we are therefore in the midst of it, trying as best we
can
     to continue our humanitarian work." UNRWA clinics had been kept
open
     around the clock, its ambulances and medical supplies had been
made
     available to those affected, and newly converted mobile clinics
had
     assisted with medical evacuations. "This has at times been a very
     dangerous task," Mr. Hansen said, as he paid tribute to the
"selfless
     courage and dedication of UNRWA staff as they go about their
     humanitarian work".

      <p>Throughout its area of operations - in Jordan, the Syrian Arab
     Republic and Lebanon as well as in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip -
     UNRWA faced increasing demands for its services, Mr. Hansen said.
The
     growth of the refugee population and the need to introduce new or
     expanded activities in its education, health, relief and social
     service programmes had placed growing pressure on UNRWA's staff
and
     its network of facilities.

      <p>The major donors to the Agency's budget, and the countries hosting
the
     refugees had recognized the vital need for UNRWA's services to
     continue at an adequate level, in the interests of the well-being
of
     the refugees and of continuing stability in the region, Mr. Hansen
     said. But the financial stringency under which UNRWA was forced to
     operate - with a cash deficit of some $27 million in its budget
     expected by the end of this year - left little room even to meet
the
     predictable growth in demand, not to mention unexpected needs, he
     said.

     <p> Several donors had pledged special contributions to see the Agency
     through the end of this year, Mr. Hansen told the Committee.
However,
     years of underfunding of UNRWA's budget had led to the prospect of
a
     steady decline in the quality of services UNRWA provided -
     "unfortunately at a time of great tension and anxiety in the
refugee
     community," he said. While 19 out of 22 major donors had steadily
     increased their contributions in terms of their own currencies
over
     the past five years, Mr. Hansen said, there was still a need for
them
     to increase the rate of growth in their contributions in dollar
terms
     to help UNRWA to bridge its budget gap. A good start, he said,
would
     be for donors to return to the target of a 5 per cent annual
increase
     in the level of contributions, which they had agreed to in 1995.
At
     that rate, he said, resources could begin to keep pace with a
growing
     population, inflation and rising needs.

     <p> UNRWA symbolized the obligation of the international community to
     ensure the well-being of the refugees, Mr. Hansen said. Shortfalls
in
     the resources made available to the Agency were seen in a
political
     light, as a sign of the weakening of that commitment. "Our task,
     therefore, has been not only to maintain and improve services to
the
     refugees, but also to reassure them that we will not falter in our
     commitment," he said.

     Mr. Hansen outlined to the Committee some of the ways in which
UNRWA
     hoped to expand schooling and upgrade training programmes for the
     refugees and to extend its successful and self-sustaining
     micro-finance and micro-enterprise programmes to all five fields
of
     operation. He also recounted some of the difficulties confronting
the
     Agency on the ground, including restrictions on the movement of
its
     staff and goods in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

     The Special Political and Decolonization Committee's debate on the
     work of UNRWA is scheduled to resume on Monday, 30 October, and to
     conclude on Thursday, 2 November.

<b>Amnesty International - USA<br>
</b>

<p><b>Fear for Safety

<br>ISRAEL/PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY/OCCUPIED TERRITORIES<br>

Civilians</b>

<p>As the crisis in Israel and the Occupied Territories deepens, Amnesty
International renews its appeals to the Israeli authorities to end the
use of excessive force by the Israeli security forces, which has
resulted in unlawful killings of Palestinians. Both Israeli settlers
and
armed Palestinian groups have fired on civilian targets.

<p>Since 29 September more than 130 Palestinians have been killed by
the Israeli security forces, nearly 40 of them children, during riots
and demonstrations in Israel and the Occupied Territories. Among them
were medical personnel carrying out their duties. More than 4,000
have been injured. The Israeli security forces have persistently used
excessive force, including lethal force, in response to the riots.
There
have also been instances of medical personnel being impeded as
they tried to provide assistance.

<p>Amnesty International sent two delegations to the area. The first
included a riot policing specialist, Dr Stephen Males. Most protests
involved demonstrators throwing stones at Israeli security forces or
guardhouses. In the Occupied Territories, including areas under the
Palestinian Authority, demonstrators also used Molotov cocktails and
firearms on several occasions. However, Amnesty International has
concluded that the security forces' response - which included the
widespread use of high-velocity rounds and rubber-coated metal
bullets, which can be lethal - was not consistent with Israeli
guidelines and international standards on the use of force. These
allow
law enforcement officers to use lethal force only as a last resort
when
life is in imminent danger. Demonstrators including young children
have
been killed when they posed no such threat.

<p>Israeli Defence Force (IDF) spokespeople told Amnesty International
delegates in Israel this week that although Israeli guidelines on the
use of force have not changed, the situation had moved beyond law
enforcement and close to armed conflict.  As a consequence, the IDF,
as a matter of policy, was no longer carrying out investigations into
killings by the security forces. The Palestinian Authority also told
delegates that they were not carrying out investigations into killings
of Palestinians by the Israeli security services.

<p>There have also been reports of apparent random firing at Palestinian
villages from Israeli settlements and vice-versa.

<p>RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send
telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/airmail
letters:

<p>To the Israeli Prime minister, Minister of Justice, Chief of General
Staff and Minister of Public Security:

<p>- expressing your fears for the safety of both Palestinian and Israeli
civilians;

<p>- reminding them that the security forces have a duty to protect and
respect life, particularly the lives of children;

<p>- urging the Israeli government to take immediate action to ensure
that the Israeli security forces comply with international standards
governing the use of force and firearms, which require that lethal
force may only be used as a last resort and only if life is in
imminent
danger;

<p>- reminding the Israeli government of their responsibility to
investigate every killing, to bring to justice anyone suspected of
unlawful killings, and to try them in accordance with international
standards;

<p>- urging them to prevent any attacks on civilians from Israeli
settlements, to investigate any such attacks and bring the
perpetrators to justice;

<p>- asking the Israeli government to initiate a review of its guidelines
on policing of riots and demonstrations without delay, to ensure that
its security forces comply with international human rights standards.

<p>To the Israeli Minister of Health:

<p>- urging him to investigate immediately the incidents in which the
security forces have opened fire on medical personnel, resulting in
the killing of an ambulance driver in the Gaza strip, and to do
everything in his power to ensure that those responsible are brought
to justice;

<p>- urging him to make sure that medical personnel are not delayed or
hindered in carrying out their duties by the Israeli security forces
or by any one else;

<p>To the Palestinian Authority

<p>- expressing your fears for the safety of both Palestinian and Israeli
civilians;

<p>- reminding the authorities that the security forces have a duty to
protect and respect life, particularly the lives of children.

<p>- urging them to prevent any attacks on civilians from the territories
under their jurisdiction, to investigate any such attacks and bring
the perpetrators to justice.

<p><b>Israeli Occupation Authorities Splinter Gaza into Three Separate
Cantons: Clashes and Sweeping of Land Continue</b>


<p>Israeli occupation forces have blocked Salah Al-Dein Street, the main
road connecting the north and south of the Gaza Strip, since early in
the morning of October 26.  The blockade was carried out in two parts 
of
the street (near Gush Qatif settlements and Kfar Darom settlement).  As
a result of this blockage, the Gaza Strip has been splintered into 
three
separate cantons.  Movement of people and vehicles has been denied.  
The
occupied Palestinian territories also witnessed clashes between
Palestinian civilians and occupying military forces.  Another martyr 
was
reported this morning from Hebron.  Meanwhile, more land was swept by
Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.  The amount of land leveled by Israel
since the beginning of this month is now up to 837 dunams.

<p>A strong explosion was heard this morning on the road leading from Gush
Qatif settlement to Kissufim border crossing in the eastern part of
Gaza.  Israeli occupation forces claimed the explosion was a failed
attempt to commit a suicide bombing by a Palestinian near a military
post on the road.  No Palestinian sources have confirmed this account.
Soon after the explosion, Israeli reinforcements arrived to strengthen
their presence on Salah Al-Dein Street.  More tanks and military
vehicles were brought to the junction.  Israeli occupying forces put
cement blocks on the road and shut off traffic in both directions.  In
the last few days, the minor roads in the area were also closed off
through the placement of large cement blocks.  The southern portion of
the Gaza Strip (Khan Younis and Rafah districts) is now sealed.

<p>During the day, Israeli occupation forces continued sweeping 
Palestinian
land.  Thirty dunams of Palestinian olive trees, palm trees, and
vegetables were leveled and a one-story house was demolished.  Water
facilities suffered damage as well.

<p>Cement blocks were also placed near the bridge that connects the 
western
and eastern portions of Kfar Darom settlement.  This bridge passes
directly over Salah Al-Dein Street.  The road is now blocked in both
directions.  Palestinians face a logistical nightmare in trying to
travel from one part of Gaza to another.

<p>Clashes erupted today in many parts of the Gaza Strip between
Palestinian civilians and occupying Israeli forces.  In Khan Younis 12
civilians were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets and five by live
ammunition while many others suffered health difficulties from inhaling
tear gas.  Fifteen houses adjacent to the settlement of Neve Dekalim
were damaged in Khan Younis refugee camp last night as a consequence of
Israeli shooting.

<p>In Rafah at Salah Al-Dein Gate six Palestinians were wounded by live
ammunition this afternoon as a result of Israeli occupation forces
firing at protesters.  Among the wounded are three children under the
age of 14.  Two of them were shot in the abdomen and the third was shot
in the thigh.  Two Palestinians were also injured by rubber-coated 
metal
bullets at Tal Sultan checkpoint between Rafah and Al-Mawasi
(agricultural area under Israeli security jurisdiction) to the west of
Rafah.

<p>In the early evening two more Palestinians were injured by live
ammunition near the Kfar Darom settlement.

<p>This morning PCHR learned that the child Ala Mohammed Mahfouz, 14 years
old from Hebron, died as a result of an injury to the head incurred 
from
Israeli occupying forces on October 6, 2000.  Mahfouz had gone to Saudi
Arabia for medical treatment.

<p>PCHR expresses its deep concern over the new escalation by Israeli
occupation forces through additional restrictions on freedom of 
movement
and the transformation of the Gaza Strip into three separate cantons.
PCHR also condemns the ongoing sweeping of Palestinian land and the
creation of new facts on the ground through the expansion of
settlements, the widening of bypass roads for settlers to use, and the
expansion of military posts.  Finally, PCHR calls upon the 
international
community to protest the excessive use of force against Palestinian
civilians and to move forthwith to uphold the Fourth Geneva Convention.
