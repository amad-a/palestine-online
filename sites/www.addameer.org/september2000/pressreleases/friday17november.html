<p><b> Day 50 Israeli Forces Kill Four Palestinians </b></p>




 <p>Israeli forces killed four Palestinians today and continued the
closure of Palestinian cities. In the early morning Israeli forces
opened fire on a Palestinian patrol at the southern entrance of
Jericho. Mohammed Qarwan, 45, was hit several times and Kahled
Salameh, 35, was shot in the chest. Both men died instantly.

 <p>At noon, Mahmoud Sammour, 38, was shot 4 times in the chest
by Israeli
troops at the southern entrance to Toulkarem. Eyewitnesses say
that
Sammour was shot before any clashes had taken place.

 <p>At 1:30 pm, sixteen year-old Hamza Abu Rayan from Halhoul was
shot in
the face with live ammunition by Israeli forces in the Al Qasabeh
area. The bullet exited the back of the head killing him instantly.

 <p>The Israeli imposed closure of West Bank cities continued in full
force today and hundreds of Israeli troops and border police were
deployed in and around the Old City. Thousands of Muslim worshippers
under the age of 45 were denied access to the Haram Al Sharif
compound.

 <p>
LAW reiterates the following:

 <p> .	The Israeli government is fully responsible for the
situation that has developed in the Occupied Territories and the
violence committed against Palestinian civilians.

 <p>.	We demand that the United National Security Council take
immediate action to protect Palestinians civilians, force Israel to
comply with the relevant provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention
and implement immediately all UN resolutions concerning the conflict.
