<b>Israeli occupation forces' tanks are stationed to the east of Gaza City, Three 
Palestinian civilians, including two children, are killed </b> 
<p> Palestine Time The Israeli occupation forces have continued their killings 
  and criminal acts against Palestinian civilians who have continued to organize 
  demonstrations in protest to the Israeli actions for the 26th consecutive day. 
  The number of martyrs killed by the Israeli occupation forces has increased 
  to 122, including 35 children, and more than 3,400 have been wounded. 
<p>Since the morning, in the area of Erez, in the northern part of the Gaza strip, 
  clashes have broken out between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation 
  forces which have responded firing live ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets 
  and tear gas. 
<p>This afternoon, the child Nedal Mohammed Dbeika, 14 years, from Al-Daraj neighborhood 
  in Gaza City, was killed by a bullet in the abdomen shot by the Israeli occupation 
  forces. Additionally, 23 people have been wounded with live bullets and 4 with 
  rubber-coated metal bullets, and dozens of civilians were hurt due to inhaling 
  tear gas used by the Israeli occupation forces in the area.
<p> The wounded were evacuated to Al-Awda hospital in Jabalya and Shifa' hospital 
  in Gaza. In Khan Yunis, this morning, the child Eyad Ossama Shaath, 12 years, 
  died from his wound in the head by a rubber-coated metal bullets shot by the 
  Israeli occupation forces on October 21, 2000. PCHR's field officer in Khan 
  Yunis reported that the child was shot from less than a 20-meter distance. Sources 
  of Shifa' hospital in Gaza stated that a bullet penetrated the child's forehead 
  and settled in his head. In Khan Yunis, clashes broke out between Palestinian 
  demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces near an Israeli military site 
  to the west of the refugee camp of Khan Yunis. The Israeli occupation forces 
  responded firing live ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas. 
  As a result, 44 Palestinian civilians were wounded by rubber-coated metal bullets 
  and 7 by live ammunition. 
<p>Additionally, dozens of civilians, mostly children, were hurt due to inhaling 
  tear gas used by the Israeli occupation forces in the area. In the vicinity 
  of the settlement of Kfar Darom, two Palestinian were wounded by live ammunition 
  fired by the Israeli occupation forces at Palestinian demonstrators. PCHR in 
  the area reported that the Israeli occupation forces threw Molotov cocktails 
  towards the area on which demonstrators assembled. As a result, trees surrounding 
  a nearby elementary school burnt. In Rafah, clashes broke out this afternoon 
  between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israeli occupation forces. 
<p>PCHR's field officer in Rafah reported that 4 Palestinian civilians were wounded 
  by live ammunition and 4 by rubber-coated metal bullets on the areas of Salah 
  El-Din Gate on the borders with Egypt, and Tal El-Sultan. In addition, dozens 
  of civilians were hurt due to inhaling tear gas. Last night, tanks and bulldozers 
  of the Israeli occupation forces invaded the road leading from Netzarim Junction 
  to Karni Outlet. Since this morning, 3 tanks have been stationed on an area 
  under the full control of the Palestinian National Authority to the east of 
  Al-Mentar area. This is an unprecedented escalation on the area where no military 
  post has ever been. This action is part of the reinforcement of the Israeli 
  occupation forces throughout the Gaza Strip in direct friction with Palestinian 
  civilians, which may threaten these civilians' security and safety. Bulldozers 
  swept the agricultural and wooded land on both sides of the road. 
<p>PCHR's field officer reported that sweeping at 21:00 GMT last night and continued 
  until 7:00 GMT this morning. They swept on both sides of the road an area of 
  40m wide and 3km long. Orchards of citrus and olive trees, hothouses and other 
  agricultural facilities were destroyed (PCHR will issue a detailed report tomorrow 
  on sweeping of land that have been carried out by the Israeli occupation forces 
  since the beginning of this month). Last night, the Israeli occupation forces 
  fired rockets and heavy bullets at some neighborhood of Hebron.
<p> As a result, Abdel Aziz Abu Sneineh, 55 years, was killed by a heavy bullet 
  in the head. PCHR learned that the martyr Abu Sneineh at home when he was shot 
  dead.
<p> PCHR reiterates its call upon the international community and the High Contracting 
  Parties to Geneva Fourth Convention to immediately intervene to stop the continued 
  killings and abuses perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces. 
<p>PCHR calls for providing international protection for Palestinian civilians 
  as it is the only way that will ensure their security and safety.
<p> PCHR warns of the continued reinforcement, establishment of new military posts, 
  and sweeping of land by the Israeli occupation forces, as these forces seek 
  to tighten their grip on Palestinian cities and villages.
<p> PCHR fear that stationing tanks of the Israeli occupation forces to the east 
  of Al-Mentar area in Gaza may pave the way for establishing a new military post 
  in the area. For more information please contact: Palestinian Centre for Human

<p><b> The Massacre Continues: Escalating their Collective Punishment Measures 
  against the Palestinian Civilians in the Occupied Territories, The Israeli Occupation 
  Forces Shelled Hebron, Beit Jala and Rafah </b></p>
<p>In the context of the current policy of the belligerent Israeli Occupation 
  Forces that encompasses killing the Palestinian civilians, destruction of their 
  properties, and shelling of their houses, these forces shelled Hebron, Beit 
  jala, and Rafah last night. In doing so, they used their tanks and anti-tank 
  missiles. Detailas are as follows: </p>
<p>1. Hebron: Israeli tanks shelled the neighborhoods of Abu Sneineh, Ashaikh, 
  Batoun, Attakrouri, Asha'abi, and Jabal Arrahmah. A missile penetrated the glass 
  of a window in a house owned by 55 year old Abdalaziz Mahmoud Taha Abu Sneineh. 
  It directly hit the back of his head resulting in his death and injury of the 
  rest of family members. This raises the number of Palestinians killed by the 
  Israelis since 29/9/2000 to 121 and the number of injured to more than 6600. 
  The shelling in Hebron resulted in the destruction of the house owned by Abdalaziz 
  Mahmoud Taha Abu Sneineh as well as another house owned by his son, Harbi Abdalaziz 
  Abu Sneineh, a 31year old father of 3 children aged between 11 months and 9 
  years. The shelling also caused damage to the windows of several other houses 
  and completely destroyed 2 cars.</p>
<p> 2. Beit Jala: The Israeli shelling resulted in destroying three houses and 
  injuring 4 Palestinians; three of them were personnel belonging to the military 
  medical services (a doctor, an ambulance driver, and paramedical rescuer). An 
  ambulance was hit by bullets and missile parts.</p>
<p> 3. Rafah: The Israeli forces shelled the houses located near Salah Addin border 
  gate using (Lau) missiles resulting in severe damage. Last night, the belligerent 
  Israeli Occupation Forces used their bulldozers and tanks to clear the trees 
  alongside the road located to the east of Gaza known by "eastern line/ road". 
  The clearing included the parts of the above-mentioned road located between 
  Karni crosssing in the north and Assuhada' junction in the south. The width 
  of the cleared area was 40 meters. These forces also closed the road connecting 
  the two halves of Gaza Strip at Ashuhada' junctin. Last night at 11:00 p.m. 
  they even opened fire at cars moving in both directions (south and north). Yesterday 
  afternoon, in the context of comprehensive closure and collective punishment 
  Israeli policies, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces closed the international 
  airport of Gaza, Rafah border passage and King Husein border passage. As a result, 
  trucks carrying medical aid could not enter the Occupied Territories. The airport 
  has been reopened early this mourning, but the siege imposed upon the Palestinian 
  cities is still very strict. </p>
<p>AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights highly appreciates the resolution issued by 
  United Nations' Human Rights Committee number E/CN.4/S-5/L.2/rev.1 on 19/10/2000 
  calling for initiating an investigation in regard to the Israeli violations 
  of human rights in the Occupied Territories. </p>
<p>In the light of this, AL-MEZAN requests the investigation committee to immediately 
  start its task. It also requests Mrs. Mary Robinson, the high commissioner for 
  human rights and the special reporters to reach the Palestinian Occupied Territories 
  as soon as possible. Moreover, it stresses its request that the international 
  community must immediately intervene to provide protection for the Palestinian 
  civilians and present the Israeli war criminals before trial as soon as possible.</p>

<p><b>al-Haq</b></p>
<p><b> Al- Haq condemns war crimes committed by Israel in the Palestinian Occupied 
  Territories Clashes continued today as at least one Palestinian was killed. 
  </b></p>
<p>Youssef Nimer Mari, from Jenin, was killed as he was struck in the heart by 
  live ammunition fired by the Israeli Occupying Forces. He was demonstrating 
  at al-Jalama checkpoint near Jenin when he was shot. Yesterday, 23 October 2000, 
  Abdil Aziz Mahmoud Abu Snieneh, 57, from the Old City of Hebron was killed after 
  the Israeli Occupying Forces opened fire from machine guns, tanks and helicopters 
  against Palestinian civilians in the city. Al-Haq's obtained reliable information 
  from eyewitness accounts from an area under curfew in Hebron's Old City, at 
  10:30pm yesterday.</p>
<p> Al- Haq learned that the Israeli occupying forces camping in Usamah Government 
  School opened fire against civilians in the area killing Abu Snieneh while he 
  was home with his family. Abu Snieneh was shot with a 500mm bullet that struck 
  him in the head only minutes after he moved his family to other rooms in the 
  house when the shooting began. According to al- Haq's field worker who visited 
  the area this morning, after curfew was lifted for only one and a half hours, 
  the house was heavily fired upon. There are 68 traces of bullets on the walls 
  of the house and another ten traces inside the house. There was no evidence 
  of gunmen, guns or any shooting from the house when the ambulance arrived 25 
  minutes after the victim was shot to death. </p>
<p>According to al- Haq's documentation, this is not the first time that the 
  Israeli Occupying Forces use heavy fire machine guns, helicopters and tanks 
  against Palestinian civilians in this particualar area. This is totally contradicts 
  statements made by the Israeli Army spokesman indicating that Israeli gunfire 
  was used only as a retalitory measure against shooting from Abu Snieneh's home. 
  </p>
<p>The location of the house is on the exact border between H1 and H2. (The 
  difference being that one is under full Israeli control and the other under 
  the control of the PA. The part under full Israeli control has been under strict 
  curfew since the beginning of this recent uprising.) Bombing this area and other 
  civilian areas is clear evidence that the Israeli Occupying Forces deliberately 
  damage the civilians' properties with the intent to inflect heavy destruction. 
  </p>
<p>All of these practices are in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 
  1949 especially article 147, Protocol I of Fourth Geneva Convention of 1977 
  and specifically Article 85. This also contradicts the Nuremberg Court and the 
  International Criminal Court Pacts. While al- Haq is deeply concerned about 
  the on-going grave breaches committed by the Israeli Occupying Forces against 
  the Palestinian civilians, it demands the following:</p>
<p> 1. Immediate international intervention by the states parties to the Fourth 
  Geneva Convention of 1949 to pressure Israel to stop its practices and provide 
  protection to Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p>2. Formation of an international criminal court, similar to that of Yugoslavia 
  and other countries to try Israeli war criminals. </p>
<p>3. Implementation of the resolution issued by the United Nations Human Rights 
  Committee number E/CN.4/-5/L.2/rev.1 passed on 19/10/2000 calling for initiating 
  an investigation regarding Israeli violations of human rights in the Occupied 
  Territories. In light of this, al-Haq requests the investigation committee to 
  immediately undertake their responsibility. </p>
<p>4. Mrs. Mary Robinson, the high commissioner for human rights and special 
  rapporteurs to reach the Palestininan Occupied Territories immediately. -END- 
  AL-HAQ, an NGO in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of 
  the United Nations and the West Bank affiliate of the International Commission 
  of Jurists-Geneva, was established in 1979 by a group of Palestinian lawyers

  Occupied Palestinian Territory. AL-HAQ, P.O. Box 1413, Ramallah, Palestine.

<p> <b>URGENT APPEAL UPDATE Rockets and Shells Bombard Palestinian Towns Tear-Gas 
  Fired into House with Children</b></p>
<p> Israeli tanks and helicopters blasted the Palestinian town of Beit Jala with 
  shells and rockets for the second straight night, destroying homes and forcing 
  families to endure another night of terror. Rocket attacks also took place in 
  the West Bank towns of Hebron and Jenin, and in Rafah in the Gaza Strip. Four 
  more Palestinians died yesterday in Israeli attacks, including a 60-year-old 
  Hebron resident shot to death in his home. Abdel-Aziz Abu Sneineh was killed 
  and four of his children injured in attacks on ten Palestinian homes in Hebron 
  last night. While the size of weapons used against Palestinian civilians continues 
  to grow, the Israeli army is intensifying its use of supposedly 'non-lethal' 
  weapons to dangerous levels. </p>
<p>UPMRC teams at the scene of clashes near the West Bank town of Ramallah yesterday 
  report that the army is firing tear-gas indiscriminately in quantities that 
  cause severe injury. Three children are hospitalized after suffering from gas 
  inhalation when a tear-gas canister landed inside their house. Medical studies 
  have documented the health hazards of using tear-gas in enclosed spaces and 
  in excessive quantities. Attacks on medical teams also continued yesterday, 
  with three more UPMRC volunteers injured.</p>
<p>18-year-olds Arafat Zaid and Murad Ramadan were struck with shrapnel from exploding 
  high-velocity bullets while assisting the injured near Ramallah. Another First-Aid 
  volunteer, 17-year-old Firas Sabbah, was hit by a rubber bullet. As always, 
  our First-Aid teams were wearing clothing that clearly identifies them as medical 
  personnel. Despite this, the number of UPMRC staff and volunteers injured by 
  Israeli military fire has increased to 14. Additionally, two ambulances were 
  attacked by Israeli forces as they attempted to reach the injured in Beit Jala 
  last night. </p>
<p>A 27-year-old Palestinian doctor, Maher Abdel-Qader, was injured in one of 
  these attacks. The UPMRC repeats its appeal for international protection for 
  Palestinian civilians from Israeli attacks and insists upon the right of medical 
  teams to aid the wounded without fear of attack or injury. </p>

<p><b>Israeli Forces Continue Firing Into Civilian Areas</b></p>
<p> Israeli forces continued to attack Palestinian residential areas yesterday, 
  further damaging Palestinian property and injuring four people. </p>
<p>Beit Jala: At 7:30 am, yesterday morning, Israeli forces using anti-tank machine 
  guns, fired on the Kbir Oneh and Aras neighborhoods of Beit Jala. Four houses 
  were hit and a doctor, an ambulance driver, a paramedic and a civilian were

  Al Aziz Abu Sneineh, one hitting him in the head, killing him instantly and 
  another wounding his eldest son. A younger son suffered a nervous breakdown. 
  </p>
<p>Gaza: At 12:30 am this morning, Israeli forces fired directly at homes at the 
  Salah Adin Gate. Several homes were severely damaged. </p>
<p>Today's Update: </p>
<p>* Israeli forces continue to seal off main West Bank towns, banning residents 
  from entering and exiting.</p>
<p>* It has been reported that more military vehicles and heavy artillery have 
  been positioned at the Ashuhada Junction, the Al Matahen and the Karni Passage 
  in the Gaza strip. </p>
<p>* Military bulldozers uprooted orange trees along the 2-kilometer road linking 
  the Karni Passage and the Ashuhada Junction. Trees planted in 40-meter swaths 
  on both sides of the road were destroyed.</p>
<p> * Israeli forces have blocked the road connecting northern and southern 
  Gaza. Deaths: Imad Sha'ath, 13, from Gaza, died today from injuries he sustained 
  after being hit in the head with a rubber coated bullet on October 21, 2000.</p>

  in clashes today. Deeb Anajar, 13, hit in the head Ribhi Al Kafazneh, 25, hit 
  in the thigh Mahmoud Abu Rayya, 15, hit in both thighs Rami Al Balbeisi, 15, 
  hit in the chest 15 year old from the Athaker family, shot in the chest</p>
<p> LAW is pursuing the following:</p>
<p> * The Israeli government is made responsible for the violence committed against 
  Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p>* Those responsible for these actions are investigated and brought to trial. 
</p>
<p>* Immediate action is taken to protect Palestinians civilians and force Israel 
  to comply with articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>
