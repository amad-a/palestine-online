<b>The Palestine Monitor, an Information Clearinghouse <br>
Urgent Appeal Update <br>
Israel Heightens Siege over Palestinian Territories, Excessive Use of 
Military Force against Unarmed Civilians Continues</b>

<p>
The Israeli government has recently heightened the state of siege 
imposed over the Palestinian territories by sealing all exit and entry 
points into the West Bank and Gaza through the military closure of all 
land bridges and of the Palestinian Airport. The Gaza Strip has been 
divided into four areas separated by Israeli erected roadblocks and 
checkpoints. The north of Gaza, the central region, as well as Rafah 
and Khan Younis in the south have all been placed under closure, not 
allowing passage of peoples or goods between each of these areas. 
<p>
Every major town and village in the West Bank has also been placed 
under complete closure and Israeli tanks have recently been positioned 
threateningly close to the borders of Palestinian controlled areas. 
The effects of closure upon the Palestinian population have been 
disastrous. The health care system in Palestine is now completely 
paralyzed, bringing the national vaccination program to near collapse. 
<p>
In the West Bank town of Ramallah yesterday the Palestinian Red 
Crescent Society’s Headquarters was attacked with automatic machine 
gun fire and other heavy ammunition shot from Pisgot settlement. Five 
first aid vehicles were destroyed, including an ambulance as well as a 
vehicle used to transport deaf children. The water reservoir on top 
of the building was also destroyed. 
<p>
While the Israeli military and government continue to claim that their 
soldiers only fire live ammunition at civilians when they are 
endangered, the story of Jadallah al-Jabari, a Palestinian man from 
Hebron, proves otherwise. Yesterday, Al-Jabari, a 50 year-old 
sanitation worker for the city, approached an Israeli soldier on foot 
at a barrier of concrete blocks. After the soldiers asked the man 
where he was going, an Israeli soldier shot Al-Jabari in the foot. An 
Associated Press cameraman was present and filmed Al-Jabari whose foot 
had been severed from his leg, leaving it hanging by sinew and flesh. 
Eyewitnesses attest that the soldiers delayed the call for a medic for 
fifteen minutes after the man had been shot while he lay in the street 
bleeding. 

<p>We, members of Palestinian civil society are appalled at the Israeli 
army’s use of excessive force against Palestinian civilians. We 
urgently appeal to the international community to insist that Israel 
lift the siege on Palestinian villages and towns and cease attacks on 
unarmed civilians. We add our voice to the widespread call for 
international protection to prevent further escalation of the 
situation.

The belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces reinforce closing the

                        Strip and divide it into



                          three isolated parts </b></p>



<p>Today 2/1/2001, and in the context of its policy aiming at closing
the
Palestinian Occupied Territories and separating them into isolated
cantons, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces has separated
the
Gaza Strip into three isolated parts. It is worth mentioning that this
is the first time Israel does this since 29/9/2000. After separating
the southern part of the Gaza Strip from its northern part on
25/1/2000 onwards, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces have
today closed Salah Addeen road at Alshuhada’/Nitsareem junction
to the
south of Gaza. At the same time, they have closed the western
(Beach)
road, which connects Annuseirat with Gaza, where an Israeli tank
has
been positioned. Both Palestinian vehicles and pedestrians have
been
prevented from using these roads. As a result, the Gaza Strip has
been
divided into three isolated parts:<p>
 - The northern zone: It extends from Beit Hanoun in the north till
Alshuhada’/ Nitsareem junction in the south.<br>
 - The middle zone: It extends from Alshuhada’ junction in the north
till Kfar Darom junction in the south.<br>
 - The southern zone: It extends from Kfar Darom junction in the
north
till Rafah in the south. <p>In the same context, the belligerent Israeli
Occupation Forces have closed the international airport of Gaza,
Rafah
border passage, and (Allenby bridge) border passage. Besides,
they
have isolated the different cities in the West Bank from each other.

<p>In the context of the Israeli policy aiming to kill the highest
possible number of Palestinian civilians, the belligerent Israeli
Occupation Forces have deliberately killed Sabry Awadh Ibraheem
Khadhr, a 50 year-old Palestinian farmer, this mourning. The martyr
was working in his field, which is located in Beit Lahia near Dogeet
settlement, when Israeli soldiers shot him in the neck. Yesterday,
and
in the same context, Israeli soldiers opened fire on Jadallah
Alja’bary at Hebron’s market from a 2 meter- distance. As a result,
his leg was severely crushed. He called for help, but the soldiers did
not provide even first aid for him, which aggravated his condition.
    <p>In the context of the Israeli policy aiming at arresting
    Palestinian
civilians, the belligerent Israeli Occupation Forces arrested three
Palestinians while on their way to travel abroad via the international
airport of Gaza. <p>These are: 1. Salah Zaid Abu Samahdanah, a
resident
of Rafah. 2. Suhail Mustafa Abboud Mudallah, a resident of
Jabalya. 3.
Mohammad Saeed Balata, a resident of Jabalya.

<p>In the light of all of this, we, at AL-MEZAN Center for Human Rights,
reaffirm that the state of silence shown by the international
community in regard to the Israeli aggression against the
Palestinian
civilians encourages Israel to commit further crimes against the
Palestinians. We also stress that the Israeli closure of the
Palestinian Occupied Territories, killing of Palestinians, destruction
of property, and bulldozing agricultural lands are considered war
crimes. Therefore the international community is requested to fulfill
their legal obligations and to bring the Israeli war criminals to
justice.

REMEMBERING THE INNOCENTS </b></p>
<p>On 28 December 2000, Defence for Children International/Palestine
Section, in coordination with the Holy Land Trust and
'Remembering the
Innocents' Day, organized in Manger Square a memorial to
Palestinian
children who have been martyred since the beginning of the Intifada
2000. The following piece was written about the event by Lori Allen,
a
U.S. doctoral student currently volunteering with DCI/PS.<p>

28 December 2000
Manger Square, Bethlehem, Palestine
<p>
REMEMBERING THE INNOCENTS

<p>By Lori Allen
<p>
This was the place where, according to religion, history, myth,
belief, Jesus was born.  Cement now covers what used to be, some two
thousand years ago, a field, or a musty inn overflowing with travelers
and merchants passing through.  Or a dusty stall, sawdust floors
stamped upon by groggy sheep or a donkey in a fit of pique.  Here, in
the midst of the hustle and bustle of a town too preoccupied with its
business and revelry to take him in, is where-- they say-- the child
who was to become a world savior, a herald of peace, a prophet
preceding Muhammad, a source of solace for millions of Christians,
began his short life.
<p>
Two thousand years later, Manger Square became a place in which to
commemorate the end of more than ninety children's even shorter lives.
More than ninety Palestinian children murdered in three months of
brutal military repression.  More than ninety children who were
students, or still too young to go to school, like
twenty-three-day-old Hind Abu Quweider, dead from tear gas.  Tear gas,
indeed.
<p>
More than ninety children who played in the streets, or who felt they
were too old to play in the streets, too hopeless to go to school, and
desperate enough to face tanks with stones.
<p>
Spread across the small plaza of Manger Square, tens of styrofoam
rocks, a meter high, eye level to the children roaming through, framed
the glossy posters of the martyred children. Shyly grinning Nasser
Khamis Birash, fifteen-years-old, from Al-Bireh.  Gapped-tooth, crew
cut hair on the head of Mohammad Abu Tahoun, fifteen-years-old, from
Tulkarem.  Deep blue eyes of sixteen-year-old Shadi Ahmad Hassan
Zghoul look out from a stone-faced, straight-on expression. The widest
grin on Jihad Abu Shahma.  Dead at twelve, though his picture must
have been taken five years ago, when he was a seven-year-old little
boy, rather than a twelve-year-old martyr. Alaa Osaama Hamdan died
when she was ten years old.  She and her father were stopped at a
checkpoint by an Israeli soldier. This soldier, probably himself only
18-years-old, maybe following orders, maybe because he was in a bad
mood, refused to let them through to a hospital. Alaa died from a lung
infection, an illness normally treatable, curable, survivable.  But
not if you are Palestinian at an Israeli checkpoint.  She is now a
martyr, her face pasted on a styrofoam grave-stone, marking her death,
attesting to her life, insisting on justice.
<p>
It was a maze of remembrance.  Palestinian families, children in
arm-linked groups, cool teen-age boys with nothing else to do,
journalists, the rare tourist all wandered through this macabre
outdoor museum, pausing in front of the pictures, maybe considering
the lives behind these faces.  Maybe some were imagining these
children as their own, thinking of their own sons, boisterous sons
still alive, trouble-makers skipping school, polite reserved boys who
like to draw and read, frustrated teenagers who have begun to think
about the future, baby girls still without teeth or words speaking
volumes with glistening eyes and flailing arms.  Maybe some were
thinking about when they themselves were romping thoughtless boys
happy to scamper across hills, shimmy up trees, contemplate insects.
<p>
The family of fourteen-year-old 'Alaa Mohammad Mahfouth congregated in
front of his photo, at his styrofoam gravestone.  The mother of
'Alaa--his poster shows a little boy with deep brown, intelligent eyes
and a polite small smile-- wept quietly.  The father looked away with
tears at the corners of his eyes.  Onlookers cried.  I watched this
unbearable scene, unable to offer comfort, no solace possible to
express, thinking of my own fourteen-year-old nephew who hates Spanish
class and has started wearing cologne.  'Alaa's cousin, himself just a
young man, a dark blue police uniform on his tall frame, respectfully
asked if his family could take the poster.   A poster for a child.
<p>
These were the children killed, now recalled as individuals rather
than numbers, people with their own pasts, who should have had
futures.  Here, where the child peace-maker is said to have received
the expensive gifts of wise men, these soft, styrofoam shapes,
criss-crossed by children's pastel finger paints, were transformed
into grave stones, children of the stones, our hearts have turned to
stone, David's stones against Goliath, stones against guns, stones
crying out.
<p>
The invitation to this ceremony reads: "Remembering the Innocents: If
they are silenced the stones will cry out."  And from a loud-speaker,
the voices of children fill the air, calling out the names of the
dead. Sami Fathi Mohammad Al-Taramsi, from Rafah, Mohammad Misbah Abu
Ghali, from Khan Younis, Khan Younis, Ibrahim Ahmad Athman, from Gaza…
Seventeen, fourteen, sixteen (the shadow of a moustache), twelve,
twelve…  Many of these boys are--were-- from the Gaza Strip.  A ribbon
of land, (17 miles long, about 4 miles wide), literally encircled by
barbed-wire, a crown of thorns, crowded in by settlers, patrolled by
soldiers in tanks, stifled by poverty.  The parents of many of these
boys have been forbidden from working, stopped at the checkpoints,
threatened with death if they try to sneak through a side-road.  Their
death or the slow starvation of their children.
<p>
These boys who were killed knew who is responsible for this grim
choice, as do all Palestinians. They know how many Israeli settlers
(6,100) live one how much land (36 square kilometers, one-third of the
Gaza Strip).  They see the futility of a younger sister's hopes to
become a doctor, the almost laughable nature of a little brother's
desire to fly a plane, to get out. Their future holds little promise.
Many of these boys learned a cynicism that is not without reason.
They know that there are few choices and diminishing prospects for
their lives, rare are the possibilities which normally spur a young
person to work, to look ahead, to hope for something better. This is
their reality and all the children with ears to hear and eyes to see
know it.  Survival is what most hope for.  But, for many, even that
simple aspiration has been snuffed out by the pressures of daily life.
 <p>The shame of a father unable to provide for his children, the grief
 of an
aunt mourning the imprisonment of a husband or death of a brother, the
restlessness of a little brother forbidden from leaving the house
because his parents fear he will be cursed and hurt by a soldier, run
over by a settler, killed at a stone- and bullet-filled confrontation.
 These are not unreasonable fears.
<p>
The children's voices on the loud-speaker continue. Karam Fathi
Al-Kurd, from Khan Younis, Nizar Mohammad Eida, from Ramallah, Wajdi
Al-Lam Al-Hattab, from Tulkarem, Mohammad Jamal Al-Dura, from Gaza.
All the children know Mohammad Al-Dura.  Countless times they have
witnessed the moment of his death, shot while huddling at the side of
his father, helpless to save him, a sinewy arm and shouting voice
incapable of protecting his eleven-year-old son from the Israelis'
bullets.  I ask a group of girls, do you know anyone who was killed?
They cry out in unison, "Mohammad Al-Dura!"  These girls are not from
Gaza, they didn't go to school with Mohammad, they never met him.  But
I think they feel as if they know him personally.  They tell me they
can't sleep at night.  They identify with that boy, terror so plain on
his face, the violence of his death so graphically displayed in the
television's freeze-frames. Mohammad screaming. Mohammad shot.
Mohammad fallen dead. Mohammad's body slumping onto the legs of his
father.  Father's head tilting over, body crouching over into shock.
Dead son on his lap.  Children here think a lot about this event.
Their drawings show stick-figure Mohammad, the father calling out in
voice-balloon desperation, sloppy oval bullets in the air, red crayon
blood.  Mainly they show fear.
<p>
Three banners are hung on the building across from Manger Square.
Long white sheets painted with children's stories.  They had been
asked to remember the innocents. (Should twelve-year-olds have to
remember innocence?)  What's on their minds? Lots of bullets, the
occasional Palestinian flag, more soldiers, Mohammad al-Dura prone on
the ground. Two older girls spent hours diligently painting the Arabic
word for Jerusalem, "Al-Quds."  Inside the letter Q, spelled out with
just as much care, the word "peace."  What's this, why is the word
peace so small?  "Because, one day, some day, there will be peace."
Looking at a square full of grey and green uniformed Israeli soldiers,
Palestinian youth in street clothes, more bullets, more blood, I asked
the artist, a teen-age girl, what this was. Looking at me, perhaps
wondering if I was as stupid as I sounded, she replied with articulate
vehemence, "This is our reality. This is what we live in. This is what
surrounds us. We have no thoughts to draw anything else."
<p>
One square of canvas held a bright yellow flower encased in gray
barbed wire.  I asked the shy artist of that one, what's this about?
She mumbled, embarrassed, "Children, Israelis, like this..."  Her
message clear.

<p>A representative of Defence for Children International/Palestine
Section (DCI/PS), the organization which set up this exhibition,
explained the significance of the large, red plastic flowers sprouting
from the styrofoam gravestones.  This is called shaqa'iq al-no'man.
According to Palestinian myth it was originally a white flower.  It
grows from the graves of martyrs, and from their blood the petals turn
red.

<p>A young man from Deheishe refugee camp sweeps his arm out in front of
him, across the stones and flowers and pictures of children, "This is
our blood."

<p>Music over the loud-speaker stopped. In Arabic and English an adult's
voice said, these are Palestinian children. They used to play
together. They deserved life. Palestinian children do not love death.
"They deserve to live and play like children anywhere else in the
world," the director of DCI/PS told me.  "But here, two thousand years
after Herod killed the children of the Holy Land, our children are
still being killed."
