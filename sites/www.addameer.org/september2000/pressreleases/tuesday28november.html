Report on Settlers' Attacks on Palestinians During the al-Aqsa 
Uprising </b></p>
<p>


Nov.23-Nov.27, 2000 

<p>Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip have been steadily increasing in the past few weeks. 
These settlers have generally acted with impunity, as the Israeli 
military and court system historically have been reluctant to arrest, 
try, and punish settlers for violence they commit against Palestinian 
civilians. As a result, settlers are virtually free to carry out 
intimidation, assaults against people and property, and even murder 
against the Palestinian population. 

<p>The existence of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories 
violates both international law and particular international 
agreements Israel is signed on. According to Article 49 of the fourth 
Geneva Convention it is prohibited to transfer civilians of an 
occupying power to the territory occupied. 

<p>Since the Oslo accord in 1993, the number of settlers in the West 
Bank and Gaza has doubled to 200,000, not including 
approximately 200,000 settlers now living in East Jerusalem. The 
building during Barak's government has actually escalated, with 
14,000 settlers added and tenders issued for building 4,000 units 
last year alone, compared with 3,000 units a year built under 
Netanyahu. Compared to 1999, in the year 2000 there has been a 96% 
increase in settlement building. 

<p>Israel has continually expropriated large amounts of land from 
Palestinians for the settlement of Jewish civilians, in order to 
change the demography of the area and create irreversible facts on 
the ground. 

<p>The AIC has been monitoring settler violence, and now introduces a 
regular updated report. 

<p>Report VIII, <br>
November 23 - November 27, 2000 

<p>On November 23: 

<p>Settlers from Arial protected by IDF soldiers uprooted about 200 olive 
trees near the Borkeen junction in the north of the West Bank. The 
trees belonged to the residents of Borkeen and Salfeet. Israeli 
sources claimed that the uprooting was necessary because Palestinians 
have been throwing stones from among the trees. 

<p>Tens of settlers threw stones and fired weapons on the main road 
leading to the village of Goseen. As a result windows of eight cars 
were smashed. The settlers also took over the road for approximately 
three hours and prevented Palestinians from using it. The event came 
after a settler was killed in the area. 

<p>During a demonstration and confrontations between Palestinians and 
Israeli soldiers in the village of Husan west of Bethlehem, settlers 
from the neighboring Beittar settlement joined the army in firing at 
Palestinian houses and cars near the bypass road leading to the 
settlement. 

<p>On November 24: 

<p>Settlers in down town Hebron attacked Arab houses in the east of Haret 
al-Shaikh and houses near Tel- Rumeida point. Three car windows have 
been smashed. Israeli soldiers were present but did not intervene to 
stop the settlers. 

<p>Settlers from Daniel took over the main road between Hebron and 
Bethlehem for about an hour and threw stones at Arab cars, forcing the 
drivers to return to Bethlehem. 

<p>On November 25: 

<p>Settlers attacked an Ambulance belonging to Rafidya Hospital with 
stones Near Fasail road by Jericho. The driver, Imad Annatour (aged 
35), was injured in head, shoulder and hand. The ambulance was taking 
an injured person from Ramallah to Nablus and was forced to use this 
long route because the road between the two cities was closed. The 
settlers also shot in the air. 

<p>Near the southern entrance to Nablus, settlers burned two carriages 
and a store belonging to Jamal Jamil Younes and Zuhair Kan'an. The 
damages are estimated at 200 thousand Shekels. 

<p>On November 26: 

<p>Settlers burned a car belonging to Malik Ghannam from Zababda near 
Jeneen. While he was on the way into town the settlers stopped their 
car in the middle of the road and one armed settler walked towards 
Malik raising a weapon at his direction. Malik left his car on the 
road and escaped into town, and when he returned with others found 
that the car was totally burned. 

<p>On November 27: 

<p>Settlers from Qiryat Sefer used big rocks to block the way linking 
villages in the Ramallah area to villages in the west, forcing 
Palestinians to use the long routes. 

<p>Settlers from Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip burned a house belonging to 
Abed al-Mu'tee Abu-Ghayyada, while other settlers opened fire on 
Waheed Thabet's house in the Aldeek section. They then prevented 
ambulances from reaching the houses. 

<p>The Palestinian Agriculture Ministry has issued a special report on 
the uprooting of trees by the Army and settlers during the current 
conflict, estimating the number of trees at around 44,181. (In more 
detail: 20,435 grapevines, 9,905 woodland trees, 6,621 olive trees, 
2,555 citrus trees, 2,000 banana trees, 489 almond trees, 101 palm 
trees and 75 trees of other types.)

 The UNHRC Report of Commissioner Mary Robinson: A Promise
to be
 Fulfilled</b></p>




 <p> Rarely does one encounter a public official, let alone an
 international civil servant, who brings humanity and genuine
concern
 to the exercise of his/her duties. The United Nations Human Rights
 Commissioner, Mary Robinson, in her report to the UN General
Assembly
 on human rights conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories
 does just that.

 <p> In the language of her written report and in the discourse of her
 oral presentation, Mary Robinson is candid, forthright, and honest.
 In summing up the conclusions reached as a result of her visit to the
 occupied Palestinian territories and to Israel, Mary Robinson paints
 a bleak picture of the tragic suffering of the Palestinian people at
 the hands of the Israeli military forces and settlers. Unlike other
 officials, though, she goes straight to the heart of the matter and
 addresses the real cause of such pervasive human rights violations as
 being the Israeli occupation itself.

 <p>In that context, she refers to the impact of the illegal Israeli
settlements on Palestinian land, to Israel's use of "excessive force"
and its "lethal" impact, and to Israel's violations of Palestinian
rights and freedoms, including freedom of movement. Significantly, she
reiterates the de jure applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva
Convention, and calls on the High Contracting Parties to assume their
responsibility under the Convention. In practical terms, Ms Robinson
calls for legal accountability for all those who engaged in the use of
lethal force, and for international monitors to be placed in the
occupied Palestinian territories while pursuing the UN human rights
Geneva resolution on the dispatching of special rapporteurs to the
region.

 <p> The Commissioner's report is also framed by a call for dialogue,
 rectification of perceptions, and negotiations as the only means for
 the resolution of the conflict.

  <p>We may take issue with some of Ms Robinson's remarks-particularly
 those that address only Israeli settlements in "heavily populated
 Palestinian areas" and the "construction of new settlements" without
 actually pointing out the illegality of ALL Israeli settlements and
 their contravention of the laws and conventions whose applicability
 she advocates. We may also discern some diplomatic efforts at
 diluting her condemnation of Israeli violence by attempting to
 address both sides (hence creating the impression of a false symmetry
 between occupier and occupied).

 <p>On the whole, this report and its conclusions are significant in
 their diagnostic as well as corrective impact. What is urgently
 required at this point is the immediate implementation of its plan of
 action in order to give it reality and genuine impact on the horrific
 conditions on the ground.

 ISRAELI ARMY CONTINUES TO SHELL
PALESTINIAN CIVILIAN
                  AREAS</b></p>
                  

<p>Yesterday, 27 November 2000, Israeli tanks shelled several
residential
areas in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The shelling of Rafah,
Khan
Younis, Hebron and Beit Jalla caused injuries to an estimated 30
Palestinian civilians.

<p>Today, 28 November 2000, during clashes between Israeli security
forces and Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied Palestinian
territories, 31 Palestinians were injured, five of whom are in serious
condition. At Salah Adin Gate in Rafah in the Gaza Strip,
Mohammad
Khafaja (26) was hit by live ammunition in the head and Mahmoud Asadni
(20) was critically injured in the abdomen. According to information
gathered by LAW, three Palestinians, Adba Al Shamali (16), Hamed Harz
Allah (16) and Alla’ Siam (20), were hit in the abdomen by Israeli
live-ammunition at Al Mintar checkpoint in Gaza.

<p>More residential areas were attacked by Israeli tank fire, including
Asheikh, Abu Sneineh and Bab Azawieh neighborhoods in Hebron. The
shelling of Beit Jalla and Aida refugee camp has caused damage to four
houses. Samira Kharouf (42) and Jihad Sandouqa (26) from Beit Jalla
were injured by shrapnel.

<p> At 7:00 p.m. Israeli settlers set on fire part of the farmland of
 Mohammad
Said Abad Al Kader Al Sadi. After entering the village of Dahiat Sabah
Al Kheir in the Jenin region, the settlers threw an unidentified
flammable substance onto Al Sadi’s field, setting the plastic covering
the vegetables on fire. The Israeli settlers also fired at the
Palestinian checkpoint close to the bypass road, which leads to the
settlement of Kadumim.

<p>LAW condemns the attacks on Palestinian residential areas by Israeli
security forces, causing serious damage to Palestinian property and
inflicting injuries on the civilian population.

<p>LAW is highly concerned about the lack of protection the Israeli army
affords to the Palestinian civilian population in cases of violence by
Israeli settlers. The establishment and maintenance of Israeli
settlements in the occupied territories is illegal under international
humanitarian law. Regardless of a strong international consensus
calling for the dismantling of Israeli settlements, the State of
Israel continues to disrupt the territorial contiguity of the
Palestinian territories, thereby creating an increasingly hostile
environment between Israeli settlers and Palestinian civilians.

<p>LAW calls upon Israel to refrain from imposing means of collective
punishments such as the policy of closure on Palestinian areas. Under
the Fourth Geneva Convention, which is applicable to the Israeli
occupation of Palestinian territories, any form of collective
punishment is prohibited
