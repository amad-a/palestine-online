Al- Haq Urges States not to Abandon International Law</b></p>
<p>

<p>Al-Haq Calls Upon the International Community of States to Enforce
International Law and International Humanitarian Law in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories and Urges them to Take Immediate
and Effective Measures Against the Government of Israel to Ensure
Compliance.<p> Al-Haq is deeply disturbed by the inaction of the international community of States as regards
Israel's ongoing violations of international humanitarian, customary and treaty law, and Israel's flagrant and continued
disregard for UN Resolutions.<p> Al-Haq's concern stems from the deafening silence of States in the face of Israel's
continued use of excessive and indiscriminate force and collective punishment against the Palestinian civilian population of
the Occupied Territories.<p> The Israeli Forces continue to enforce complete closures on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, bomb civilian areas, carry out willful killings and use excessive force against Palestinian civilians.<p> All of these
policies and practices constitute gross violations of numerous international instruments that Israel has ratified including the
International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Covenant on the Rights of the Child, the Fourth
Geneva Convention of 1949, and the Hague Regulations of 1907.<p> Evidence of these violations has been communicated
on a regular basis to the International Community and relevant UN bodies.<p>The military closure imposed on
the Occupied Territories has now entered into its third month. Placing a nation under siege and cutting villages and towns
off from one another and the outside world is a clear violation of international human rights and humanitarian law.<p> The
closure severely disrupts the economic, social, religious and cultural life of the Palestinian community.<p>The denial of
Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement violates Article 13(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article
12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As an occupying power, Israel has failed to perform its
duty under international customary law to balance its security measures against the welfare of the occupied population
(Hague Regulations Article 43).<p> The Israeli military is permitted under International Law to impose restrictions on the
freedom of movement of a local population, but only to the degree that the restrictions limit military actions.<p> Blanket
restrictions that restrict all movement for extended period of time and that are implemented to punish the population are
illegal.<p>Israeli leaders have openly stated that they are using these measures as a form of collective punishment against the
Palestinian population in response to acts of resistance against the occupation.<p>Israel continues to
refuse to abide by its obligations under international law. By its consistent disregard for the will of the international
community, including UN Security Council resolutions, Israel has become a legal renegade, placing itself above
international responsibility.<p>The failure of the international community of States to act decisively and effectively to halt
Israel’s violations of international treaties, customs and humanitarian and human rights law threatens to undermine the very
basis and credibility of these laws and treaties, which must be applied impartially and non-selectively.<p>Unless this trend is
reversed, the Occupied Territories, and indeed, international peace and security, will continue to be held hostage to Israel’s
unilateral action, and to international inaction.<p> Al-Haq therefore urges the international community to fulfill its international
legal responsibilities.<p> Al-Haq also calls upon the UN and its member states to work to restore respect by Israel for the
Provisions of the UN Charter, UN Security Council Resolutions and international human rights and humanitarian law.

<p><b>
ISRAEL CONTINUES TO EMPLOY WAR METHODS
AGAINST PALESTINIANS</b></p>
           

<p>The excessive and indiscriminate use of force and firearms
employed by
the Israeli security forces against Palestinian demonstrators
resulted
in several injuries and destruction of property. Today, 26 November
2000, Assad Shaghnobi (22) died from wounds suffered earlier this
week.

<p>During demonstrations at the Al Muntar checkpoint in the Gaza
Strip on
21 November 2000, Assad Khalil Al Shaghnobi (22) from Al Sabra
neighborhood in Gaza City was hit by Israeli live ammunition in the
head. Despite intensive medical surgery Shaghnobi died today.

<p>Today, Israeli soldiers shot three Palestinian children with live
ammunition at the Al Muntar checkpoint. Ahmed Shehadah (16) from
Jabalia refugee camp was hit in the head. 15-year-old Bassam Al
Ta’aban from Al Shajiah was shot in the eye. The third child, who has
not been identified yet, was hit in the face.

<p>Israeli tanks, stationed at the Tufah checkpoint in the Gaza Strip,
fired rockets at houses in Khan Younis refugee camp. The house of Adel
Salim Abu Oubeid was hit by a rocket and caught fire. It was the
second time that Oubeid’s house was hit. Reportedly, some Palestinian
families from Khan Younis, who live close to the Tufah checkpoint, are
leaving their houses. Last night shots fired from the Dogid settlement
and rockets launched from Israeli military ships attacked the Al Saifa
neighbourhood north of Beit Lahia. Five Palestinian houses were hit
and the water pump of the local well was damaged.

<p>In the West Bank, Mohammad Abdallah Badel (18) from Lekia was hit by
live ammunition in the leg at the northern entrance of Al Bireh.
Furthermore, Khaled Abu Kalbush (24) from Araba village was hit in the
head during clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
security forces.



<p>LAW condemns the destruction of Palestinian property by the Israeli
occupying forces. The destruction of property of the occupied civilian
population, which is not of military necessity, is a violation of
international humanitarian law.

<p>LAW condemns the excessive use of force by the Israeli security
forces, especially against Palestinian children. Children are afforded
a high degree of protection within international human rights and
humanitarian law and Israel is obliged to comply with the relevant
provisions.

<p>LAW demands the implementation of the Palestinian right to return. The
right to return is deeply anchored in all human rights instruments
supporting the provisions of UN Resolution 194, which sets down the
legitimate right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes.

Visiting Palestinian Detainees inside Israeli
                       Prisons<br>
                                Campaign Organized by LAW Society</b></p>


<p>The Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the
Environment (LAW) has organized a campaign of visits to
Palestinian
prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons including Hadareem, the
Prisons’ Authority Hospital in el Ramla, Majido, and Shata. The
campaign’s aims are two fold. To support Palestinian detainees,
especially in the current situation and to support prisoners’ families
who have been deprived of the right to visit their loved ones for the
past two months (since the start of the intifadah on September 29,
2000).

<p>Hadareem Prison

<p>During their visit to Hadareem prison, LAW Society’s lawyers met with
the following four Palestinian prisoners: Ali Amudi (representing
prisoners). Amudi is from Khan Yunis and has been serving his three
life sentences since 1994, Mohammad Taqatqa, from Beit Fajar, who has
been serving a life sentence since 1994. Ibraheem Nawahda, who has
been serving a ten-year sentence since 1993, and Jalal Rumani, serving
an 18-year sentence. Jalal is also ill and requires treatment but the
prison’s administration has repeatedly delayed access to medical
treatment.

<p>The Palestinian prisoners complained of maltreatment received from the
prison’s administration. They also complained about the bad medical
treatment they received from the prison’s doctor who reportedly showed
carelessness toward the cases he treated. According to the prisoners,
the food at Hadareem, prepared by common criminals, is of bad quality
and insufficient. Consequently, many prisoners suffer from stomach
problems.

<p>The prisoners also stated that the administration of Hadareem declared
a state of emergency inside the prison at the beginning of the
Intifada which has added to the stress of prison life.
<p>
El Ramla Prison

<p>LAW Society’s lawyers also visited prisoners Mohammad Marar and Ribhi
Harash, currently receiving medical treatment at (Marash) the Prisons’
Authority Hospital in el Ramla. Mohammad Marar told LAW Society’s
lawyer that he had been arrested on October 2, 2000 after being
wounded in the leg on the fourth day of the current Intifada. He was
standing on top of his house when he was wounded. Marar added that
after his arrest, the Israeli soldiers dragged him on the ground for
100 meters and took him to Surka hospital in Bir el Sabi’a, where he
spent 23 days before he was taken to Khashabiyit el Majnuni in Hebron
and then eventually taken on to el Ramla. The lawyers also met with
prisoner Ribhi Harash from Tulkarem who has been serving a 12-year
sentence since 1989.

<p>The following Palestinian detainees are also held at el Ramla hospital
since they need continuous medical attention: Ali Shalalda, Mohammad
Khateeb, Mohammad Abu Hadwan, Juma’a Ismail (all from Jerusalem),
Amjad Husni from Qalqilia, Mohammad Bsharat from Tubas, and Akram
Salami from Khan Yunis.

<p>The Palestinian prisoners at el Ramla hospital complained of bad
quality food, they also complained of being deprived of recreation
facilities. As a result, the prisoners rarely leave their rooms.

<p>Majido Prison

<p>LAW Society’s lawyers visited three prisoners at Majido, Khalid Jado
from Bethlehem who has been serving a four and a half year sentence
since 1997, Mu’tasim Dawood from Qalqilia, and Muayad Abu Baker from
Jenin, sentenced to two and a half years in 1999.

<p>The prisoners complained of the temperamental prison administration.
They stated that the food supplies have been reduced by 15%, the
administration claims that this is for budgetary reasons. Moreover,
prisoners complained of neglect vis-a-vis their medical conditions and
treatment, which is limited to painkillers.

<p>The prisoners stated that they were locked up in 32 tents, each with a
capacity of holding 20 people. There are also prison cells where 60
prisoners are kept in each cell. They complained of cold weather
inside the tents during winter. Families have been unable to bring
them winter clothes due to the closure imposed on the Palestinian
territories.

<p>The prisoners also complained of the conditions of the visitors’ rooms
where there are no toilets and there exists a glass barrier that
separates prisoners from their families and lawyers. Majido holds
approximately 640 Palestinian prisoners mostly from the West Bank, as
well as 11 administrative detainees.

<p>LAW Society lawyers also visited Jasir Sawafta from Tubas who has been
held at Shata prison since his arrest on November 18, 2000. He was
arrested at Bisan (beyond the Green Line). Sawafta was sentenced to 21
days detention and fined NIS 800.
