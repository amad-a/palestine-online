<b>SHARM EL-SHEIKH FACT-FINDING COMMITTEE SUSPENDS ITS INVESTIGATION DUE 
TO ISRAEL¹S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE</b>
<p>
The Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee today informed the 
Palestinian side that it is suspending its work due to Israel¹s 
refusal to cooperate with the Committee. This announcement comes on 
the eve of marathon talks between Palestinians and Israelis at Taba, 
Egypt. 
<p>
Minister of Culture and Information, Yasser Abed Rabbo, responsible 
for relations with the Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee, 
expressed his anger and disappointment stating, ³Israel¹s tactics are 
to prevent an objective and thorough investigation into the cause of 
the current crisis and into Israel¹s systematic violations of 
Palestinian human rights. This latest decision by the Committee 
demonstrates that these tactics are working.² 
<p>
The current crisis, which has claimed the lives of 341 Palestinians, 
was sparked by Likud leader Ariel Sharon¹s provocative visit to the 
Haram al-Sharif on September 28, 2000. International and regional 
leaders attending the Sharm El-Sheikh Summit in October 2000 
unanimously endorsed the establishment of an international committee 
to investigate the root causes of the recent clashes and recommend 
ways to bring an end to the violence. 
<p>
³Once again, Israel is demonstrating its defiance of the international 
community by refusing to cooperate with this international Committee. 
Israel must not be allowed to dictate or change the terms of this 
Committee¹s work,² said Minister Abed Rabbo. 
<p>
The Committee¹s investigation has been hampered since last Monday when 
Israel announced the end of its formal cooperation with the Committee, 
citing the Committee¹s unaccompanied visit to the Haram al-Sharif as 
the reason. In response to Israel¹s decision, the Committee announced 
on Thursday that it was delaying the trip of its 5-member delegation 
to the region for three weeks. The Committee has not indicated when it 
will resume its investigation. 
<p>
This week, Israel¹s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced its 
unwillingness to cooperate with an inquiry set up by the United 
Nations Human Rights Commission to investigate the violence. 
<p>
Minister Abed Rabbo added, ³This latest Israeli action casts serious 
doubt upon its intention to negotiate in good faith.² 

<p>Minister Abed Rabbo called upon the international community to 
intervene to ensure the prompt resumption of the Committee¹s work: ³It 
is imperative that the international community immediately renew its 
support for this international inquiry.²

<b>Public Statement 
On 
Executions and Assassinations </b>

<p>

Over the past few weeks of the Palestinian-Israeli confrontations, a 
very disturbing trend has taken root. Israel adopted a policy of 
assassinating Palestinians accused of leading the Intifada. This 
policy relied on extensive intelligence and surveillance dependent on 
Palestinian collaborators. In return, the PNA responded to this policy 
by starting a crack down on collaborators who give information to 
Israel that leads to the death of Palestinian activists. The PNA tried 
and executed a number of these collaborators in a matter of days. 
<p>
In addition, the Director of Palestinian TV and Radio Hisham Mikki was 
assassinated; and another Palestinian was killed in a family dispute. 
<p>
With regard to these events, the Programme stressed the following 
points: 
<p>
- The policy of assassination is a clear and flagrant violation of 
international human rights standards. Regardless of the party that 
carries out the assassination and the reason behind it, no one can be 
judged with a fair and impartial trial that ensures the due judicial 
process that guarantees the rights of the accused. <p>- The increase in 
Palestinian internal violence is a disturbing trend indicating the 
rising frustration in the confrontation with Israel and the 
redirection of energy inward. This is also evident in the execution of 
collaborators after hasty trials. The PNA should heed this dangerous 
signal and come up with adequate solutions. <p>- The policy of 
assassination or executions is rejected under any circumstances. If an 
individual is accused of any crime. He\she should be given a fair and 
impartial trial. If guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt, the 
punishment must not violate the right of life. Therefore, the death 
penalty should not be used under any circumstances.<p> - GCMHP calls upon 
Israel to stop yet another grave violation of human rights represented 
by its policy of assassination. In addition, the Programme calls upon 
the PNA to stop using the death penalty in punishing collaborators. 

<p>Sincerely, 
<p>
Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj
