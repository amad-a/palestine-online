* The City of Salfeet lies in the middle north of Palestine with an elevation of
570 meters. The word “Salfeet” is composed from the affixes (sal) which
means box and (feet) which means grapes: this is due to the fact that the City
of Salfeet was famous for grapes and vine which are still spread out in the
City.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size="4">* The City is situated on a hill,
on a nice geographic location supervising Wadi Al- Sha’r to the east and Wadi
al Matwi to the west.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size="4">* Salfeet is an old city and
considered to be of the Kananite Era and became part of the Roman and, later,
the Islamic Empires.</font>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman,Times" size="4">*
In the Turkish period Salfeet was part of Beirut State, and in 1882 became the
center of the district. In 1945 during the British Mandate <b>the Village
Council</b> was established and in 1952 during the Jordanian Era was transformed
to <b>Local Council</b>. Finally in 1955 it was promoted to <b>Salfeet
Municipality</b>. Since then Salfeet Municipality was presided by the following
gentlemen :</font>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><font size="+2">1 – Mr. Omar Afaneh
1955 – 1956.</font></b>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><font size="+2">2 – Mr. Mahmoud A.
Jawwad 1958 – 1965.</font></b>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><font size="+2">3 – Mr. Nimr
Al-Harim 1965 – 1966.</font></b>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><font size="+2">4 – Mr. Hasan
Al-Zeer 1966 – 1997.</font></b>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><font size="+2">5 - Dr. Shaher
Ishtieh : the current Mayor of Salfeet</font></b>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman,Times">After the establishment of the
Palestinian National Authority in 1995 the district was promoted to “Salfeet
Governorate” in order to develop the area and protect it from settlements.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman,Times">* This governorate extends from
the east to the west starting from Za’tarah on Nablus-Ramallah Road reaching
the Green Line beside Kufr Qasem. This area is separated from the areas of
Nablus and Qalqilia naturally by Wad Qana Valley in the north and from the Area
of Ramalla to the south by Wadi–Saridah.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman,Times">* In this governorate we have 21
populated zones with 70.000 inhabitants and a surface area amounting 218 km2.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman,Times">* This governorate is depending
economically on the olive cultivation and stones.</font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman,Times">* Regional roads which connect
the towns and villages in the governorate are old and they were not maintained
since the Jordanian Era. These towns and villages need a direct connection with
the surrounding areas; specially the other Palestinian Governorates, such as
Ramallah, Nablus, Qalqilia.</font>
