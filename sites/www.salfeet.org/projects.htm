City Undergoing Projects &amp; Important Needs,</marquee>

<font SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Municipality of Salfeet is implementing the following vital
projects:</p>
<u><b>

<p><em> The Electricity Network:</em></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Salfeet Municipality began providing the inhabitants with electricity
in 1956 by means of electrical generators in small projects. These projects developed
according to the need but gradually till 1993 when the municipality connected the network
with the Electricity Company in a complete project. Part of it has been executed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to complete the execution of the project the municipality
needs:</p>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>The construction of a high tension network for the Industrial Zone and the Old City with
    the necessary transformers. This network is of 3.5 kilometers long.</li>
  <li>The construction of a low-tension network of 5 kilometers long for industrial purposes
    and of 7 kilometers long for house purposes.</li>
  <li>Preparing and maintaining the old low tension network.</li>
  <li>Providing a car and electricity workshop. </li>
  <li>Providing a winch vehicle for the implementation of the necessary works and maintenance.</li>
  <li>Supplying the municipality with the different spare parts for the high and the low
    tension. </font></li>

<p><em>The Water Project for the City of Salfeet :</em></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/salfeet3.jpg" width="330" height="475"></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The City of Salfeet depended till 1985 on its own water resources to
meet its need of water for house usage. Al-Sekka and Al-Matwi Springs supplied people with
water with a daily average of 300 cubic meters.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The water network was connected with Water Company in 1985 to meet the
increasing need of the people.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the limited of available resources, water is one of the most
important issues in Palestine. So for developing this service and for reducing the water
loss amounting 40 %, it is very important to implement the following projects: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Implementing a new water pipeline to connect Al-Matwi with the city of 6 Kilometers long
    and of 6 inches diameter.</li>
  <li>Providing different spare parts for the city water project.</li>
  <li>Providing a workshop for repairing the equipment and for maintenance.</li>
  <li>Implementing the proposed 10</font><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"> </font><font SIZE="4">inches diameter pipeline to connect the city main reservoir with the main water
    resource of 3 km long. This pipeline will enable the City of Salfeet and the nearby
    villages to make use of our full share of water amounting 600.000 m3 / year according to
    the Oslo Peace Agreement. This line needs only implementation; the municipality has
    already prepared the necessary pipelines and other accessories.</li>
  <li>The cost of carrying out these projects is US $ 500.000.</font></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="4"><u><b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em> The Internal Road Network:</em></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the City Master Plans Salfeet enjoys a good road network
reaching 55 km long. The municipality has opened and partially paved 90 % of the planned
roads. For the completion and integrality, it is important to implement the following
projects:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I – Opening the rest of the planed roads amounting 5 Kilometers
long to support the building process in the city and supply services to the all areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">II- Asphalting 20 km of the opened roads.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">III- Maintaining 10 km of the old roads.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of this project is US $ 1 million.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present there are two basic schools in Salfeet: one for boys and one
for girls and other two secondary schools for boys and girls. In addition, there are 4
Kindergartens.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Municipality of Salfeet has added more classrooms. The increasing
number of students imposes the necessity to carry out following:</p>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>Building two additional basic schools for boys and girls.</li>
  <li>Building two kindergartens.</li>
  <li>Building a meeting hall for public meetings and student activities.</li>
  <li>Building laboratories for the two secondary schools and providing them with the
    necessary equipment.</li>

<p><em> Intermediate Education :</em></font></b></u>

<ol START="5">
  <font SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To decrease the burden of the national universities and
  for developing Salfeet Governorate, it is necessary to build an Intermediate College to
  take over the task of qualifying students. This project will solve many problems that
  students suffer from.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of building this project is US $ 1.5 million.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/projec11.jpg" width="330" height="227">

<ol START="5">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinians in general suffer from severe lack of recreational and
  entertainment facilities for children and women. Salfeet Governorate, in particular
  suffers from this subject because there are no gardens, no playgrounds and no recreation
  places for the people in leisure time. Therefore, and for the great vital importance of
  such projects, we are trying to provide the people with five recreation places distributed
  in the city different quarters.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of this project is US $ 500.000.</p>

<p><u><b><em> The Administrative Complex :</em></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present the official offices and public services are located in
different dispersed places of private property. This situation causes many difficulties
for the inhabitants and a lot of other complications.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To solve the problem, Salfeet Municipality tries hard to raise the
necessary fund in order to implement The Administrative Complex Project consisting of the
following facilities :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Commercial market &amp; storage .</li>
  <li>Creating additional space for the municipality in order to meet the growth of people and
    responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Providing a public hall for the public meetings and activities.</li>
  <li>Providing appropriate places for 15 official offices.</li>

<font SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present there are two cultural &amp; sport clubs supervising and
organizing the youth activities in Salfeet. The young men club was established in 1974,
whereas the other club, for women, started its activities in 1995.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facilities available for the young consist of the municipal
playground and the high school yard. These facilities do not meet the sportive needs of
the youth of the city.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, and for raising the level of youth through meeting their
needs of sport and recreation, it is important to actualize the following projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stadium with a football playground.</li>
  <li>Implementing a gymnasium for handball, basketball,tennis and volleyball.</li>
  <li>Implementing open playgrounds outside the city for different kinds of sports.</li>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Salfeet Governorate suffers a lot from the lack of health facilities ;
there is one small health clinic serving the inhabitants of the city. Even though the
population of the area are about 70,000 citizens , there are no hospital or emergency
center.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore , and in order to create a better medical care for the
citizens it is urgently important to implement the following :</p>

<ol>
  <li>A hospital with the necessary specialization to serve Salfeet Governorate completely and
    to help solve the crisis of overcrowdedness that the hospitals of the West Bank suffer
    from.</li>
  <li>Implementing two emergency centers in the governorate.</li>

<p><em> Extending and Planing the Boundaries of the City :</em></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The City of Salfeet with its current area ( 4.000 donums ) , and being
the center of the governorate , can’t assimilate the necessary needs of the
inhabitants of the city .</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, and in order to activate this process and meet the needs of
the inhabitants it is necessary to implement the following :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extending the current boundaries of the City of Salfeet and laying out the necessary
    detailed plans,</li>
  <li>The appropriation of the Public Places and preparing it for use since this area is

There are different small commercial places scattered in some areas, but all these places
can’t fulfill the situation in a systematic way and can’t meet the needs of the
inhabitants. Therefore, the municipality tries to organize the commercial activity through
establishing a new commercial center with an area of 10 donums to solve this problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Well-organized road network, ( partially finished ).</li>
  <li>Well-organized gardens.</li>
  <li>Electricity and water networks ( partially finished).</li>
  <li>Commercial buildings, service centers and car parks.</li>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/salfeet4.jpg" width="330" height="229"></b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The local current technique in Salfeet depends on the absorption holes
beside each building. When full, people pump out sewage out of these holes and take their
contents to the outside fields. This process is very difficult, harmful to public health
and causes environmental pollution. To confront this major issue the municipality has
prepared the necessary plans for a complete drain network and purification pools to serve
all the inhabitants of the city. This project includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implementing the lines of drains to the city different parts .</li>
  <li>Establishing stations for purification and refining in order to reuse the treated water.</li>

wastes are being sent to the city dump which is not sufficient; there is no treatment.
Therefore it is harmful and causes environmental pollution.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore and in order to improve the present situation and to provide
the best solution , the municipality tries to carry out the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Providing a large new garbage car to collect waste from the city quarters daily.</li>
  <li>Providing 100 large containers to be distributed in the overcrowded quarters of the city
    .</li>
  <li>Providing 400 small containers to be distributed in the city.</li>
  <li>Allocating a new dump and building a wall around it. The garbage is to be treated in the
