      <td width="64%">The city of Qalqilia is situated on the longitude and
latitude of ( 17750/ 14690). It is about 65 meters above sea. The city has a
distinguished geographical site for being located in the Palestinian coastal
plain. The East side of this plain reaches the oldest heights of Nablus.<br>
Forming a Natural separation point between the plain from the West and the
mountain from the East.<br>
In the ancient times it was a Passway for trade caravans and military raids.<br>
It was a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>transportation net for
many roads joining many Palestinian Cities as Tulkarem, Haifa, Jaffa, Lid, Ramla,
Al Majdal and Gaza in the southern West, and Nablus, Jerusalem, and Hebron from
the east.<br>
Qalqila was originated on a flat plain part of the Palestinian coastal plain
adjoined to the old heights from the east., and some valleys from the north and
south. These villages sometimes overflood in winter. It was and still is an
important site hat served the agricultural and trade purposes. Some sources
point out that its oldest location is about five kilometers far from the north
of <i>Ras al Ein</i>, today it is one of the nearest villages to Qalqilia.<br>
Other sources point out that its oldest location lies in the villag of Habla
near Qalqilia. These assumptions are far from being true, for I think Qalqilia
was near the old Omari Mosque in the old city. News ands tales pointed out that
it was a small village surrounding its buildings and old well. It was a route
for Caravans visited by the shepherds and their cattle. A few number of people
worked in agriculture or were farmers and raised cattle. Their buildings
centered round the old mosque.</td>
