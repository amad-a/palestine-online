<p>December 11, Palestinian census takers stand in the rain, knocking on
people's doors in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. But many residents
literally hide behind their closed doors, fearing a census which anywhere
else would be an exercise in basic civics. Even answering questions as
simple as "Do you have central heating?" can be risky. East Jerusalem's
Palestinians do not allow themselves to be photographed, for fear that
Israeli authorities will revoke their residency cards and evict them from
the city where their families have lived for centuries. The first-ever
Palestinian census turned into a tug-of-war over Jerusalem when Israel's
government pushed a bill through Parliament blocking Yasser Arafat's
census-takers from operating in the disputed city.</p><br>
