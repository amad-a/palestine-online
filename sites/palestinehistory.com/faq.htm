<b>Q. WHAT IS THE ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT? AND WHO TO SOLVE IT?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>The Arab-Israeli conflict in modern history is simply an illegal Jewish occupation of the Palestinian lands in two stages. The first stage was in 1948; they occupied 78% of the Arab-Palestinian lands and established their state, Israel. The second stage was in 1967. Israel launched an offensive war against the Arabs and occupied the rest of the Palestinian lands, which consisted of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip.<br><br>
Until 1988, Palestinians attempted to regain their land by legitimate military struggle, by establishing the PLO and a number of other fighting groups. <br><br>
In 1988, the Palestinians, in order to come to a practical solution to their situation, accepted a large compromise by recognizing Israel's fictitious right to exist in Palestinian lands, stolen in 1948, however still demanding the end of the Israel's occupation of the Palestinian lands captured in 1967, allowing the establishment of a Palestinian state there.<br><br>
The Palestinians, in order to have their freedom and to end the occupation of the lands, attempted different strategies including diplomacy, peace talks and public protest. The Intifada is another way to protest the continued occupation. <br><br>
Regardless of all the approaches and after the compromise from the Palestinians, Israeli has not ended their occupation of the Palestinian lands captured in 1967. Parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank have been granted severely limited autonomy under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, as part of a peace agreements signed after 1993.<br><br>
The only way to end the 100 years of conflict is, Israel should comply with International law and to UN resolutions related to the Arab-Israeli conflict (194, 242 and others), which consider the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands in stolen 1967 as illegal, stipulating Israel must end it's occupation. By ending the occupation and solving the issues caused by it, such as Palestinian refugees issue and the issue of Israel settlement in West Bank and Gaza Strip, and giving the Palestinian there legitimate right to rule themselves in their own country, to decide for themselves, to take care of there own future and to have their FREEDOM, then the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will be over.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHAT IS THE PROPOSED STATE OF PALESTINE?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>State of Palestine, which consists of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip have been under illegal military occupation by Israeli forces since 1967, and in 1988, the Palestinian National Council, (the Palestinian parliament), declared the PROPOSED state of Palestine as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as the capital. This declaration was based on UN resolution number 242 and other resolutions related to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This proposed state is not independent yet.<br><br>
After the peace agreement signed with Israel in 1993, parts of Gaza Strip and the West Bank has been given back to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and other areas, which is more then 60% are still under Israeli military occupation. <br><br>
The declaration of the Palestinian state means to declare the independence of Palestine and the end of the Israeli occupation. Israel still refuses to end their occupation and return the rest of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to the PNA while simultaneously continuing their expansion of the illegal Jewish there.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHAT ARE EAST AND WEST JERUSALEM?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Before the year 1948, the city of Jerusalem was a totally Arab city under the Britain mandate on Arab-Palestinian lands. After the 1948 war between Jews and the Arab countries, Israel was established and occupied the western portion of Jerusalem. All the holy sites are in the east side of the city in an area named, "The OLD CITY," which is surrounded by a very large wall with gates, (some of which are closed). East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control from 1948 and until 1967.<br><br>
In 1967, Israel attacked the Arabs and managed to occupy the Eastern part of the city, the West Bank, Gaza Strip and some other Arab lands. Since then, the whole city of Jerusalem has been under occupation.<br><br>
Since the occupation began in 1967, a number of UN resolutions as well as international law, (both of which consider it illegal), have demanded Israel end occupation by returning back to the borders the day before war broke-out, and to solve the other issues caused by it, such as the Palestinian refugees and the Jewish settlers in the 1967 occupied lands.<br><br>
East Jerusalem according to International law and UN resolutions is part of the West Bank, which was occupied by Israel in 1967. Therefore, it should be freed and given back to the Palestinians During the current peace process, Israel is asking to divide East Jerusalem to keep parts of it with Israel; this is not acceptable to the PNA leaders, the Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims and is in violation if the international law and UN resolutions.<br><br>
About what Israel calls " The Walling Wall ", this is the western wall of the old city.  However, large numbers of Islamic holy places and sites are located there.  In fact, the wall is one side of Al-Aqsa mosque complex (one of the holiest Islamic places on earth). Al-Aqsa Mosque is one the northern boarders of the walled old city. The Jews claim that this wall is the only remnant of Solomon's Temple, which has been destroyed millennia ago. It was totally demolished around 60 BC, and completely removed from the complex. The current wall is an integrated part of the Old City's wall and Al-Aqsa Mosque. Hundreds of archeological expedition by Arabs, Jews and others all confirm that the wall had been built during the Islamic age after 650 CE, with some parts being re-built in different years afterwards <br><br>
In 1930, during the British mandate on Palestine, there was a claim by the Jews that the wall is a holy place and they want control over it in order to pray. In court, it was stated that the wall is legally owned by Arabs and is an integrated part of the walls of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. <br><br>
Israel, since their occupation in 1967 until today, is trying to find any archeological evidence prove to their claim. There was a research paper by a Jewish archeological researcher, Zeef Herzog, challenging most of their tales in their old books since there is no any archeological proof to be found. Therefore, this wall is an original part of the mosque and it is proven to be from the Islamic age and have nothing to do with Solomon's Temple.<br><br>
The Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Western wall are linked by the story of  "al-Esra w al-Mearaj" In Islam, on one of the greatest days of our Hijri year, (our own Islamic calendar), Prophet Mohammed visited Al-Quads (Jerusalem) during the night. When he arrived, he tied his horse (called Al-Boraq) to the Western Wall of Al-Aqsa mosque (Therefore, we called it the "Western wall" or " Al-Boraq wall "). Prophet Mohammed prayed as an Imam for all other Prophets in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which means that he is the last Prophet of Allah and he is the leader of all Prophets. Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven to meet with Allah ("God"). There, he was ordered by Allah to ask Muslims to pray five times a day. <br><br>
The Al-Aqsa Mosque was the first Qebla, (the direction were Muslims turn his face during pray), for Muslims, lasting for more then 17 months until Allah ("God") ordered Prophet Mohammed to change the Qebla to Mekka. This holy place in Jerusalem was mentioned hundreds of times by Prophet Mohammed's Syria (his sayings and actions), which Muslims consider as part of Sharia'a (the Islamic religious law).<br><br>
The Holy Koran mentions the story of "al-Esra w al-Mearaj" and Jerusalem and gives the Mosque the current name, which means the Far Away Mosque (in Arabic Al-Aqsa mosque). <br><br></p>

<b>Q. DO ARABS ACCEPT THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO EXIST?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>All Arab countries adopted the peace strategy based on the UN resolutions, which divides Palestine into two countries. <br><br>
Israel in 1948 war took more lands (78% of Palestine) then what it was given to them by the partition plan 1947 and in 1967 they occupied the rest of Palestine which is West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. Arabs and Palestinians demands the implementation of UN resolution number 242 which consider the Israeli occupation in 1967 as illegal and asked Israel to end the occupation and return to the boarders before the 1967 war. Palestinian and Arabs also demands the implementation of other UN resolutions related to the Palestinian refugee issue and other sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict.<br><br>
All Arab countries including the Palestinians accepted the right of Israel to exist against the above demands. Some Arabic countries like Egypt and Jordan already signed peace agreements with Israel, some other countries have some sort of diplomatic relation with Israel like Morocco, Qatar, Oman, Mauritania and Tunisia.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. IS THE CURRENT AREA WITH THE PALESTINIANS GOOD FOR A STATE?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Israel based on the peace talks in the first stage peace agreements, withdraw the Israeli army from most parts of Gaza Strip and some parts of West Bank. <br><br>
In Gaza Strip, there are still Jewish settlements with about three thousand Jews settlers' lives there and an equal or more number of soldiers to protect them. <br><br>
In West Bank, there is "Area A", some areas that is a heavenly populated towns under total control of the Palestinian Authority. "Area B", some towns under partial Palestinian authority and the security are in the hand of Israel.  "Area C" is totally in hands of the Israeli, which are the settlements, some Arab towns and main roads to the towns and settlements. The percentage of West Bank in the hand of Palestinians are less then about 40% and it is not a continues as one body it is divided like an isolated islands between the Israel occupied areas.<br><br>
The hole Gaza Strip and West bank including East Jerusalem are small places, even that Palestinians accept it and Israel is not willing to give it back. <br><br>
With the current peace talks we have to get a save passage through Israel between Gaza Strip and West Bank. There is already one save passage or route opened last year but still it is under Israeli control and permit to be obtained in advance.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY PALESTINIAN STARTED AL-AQSA INTIFADA?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Palestinian people are under Israeli occupation since more then 33 years. 78% of the historical Palestine lands have been occupied by Jews in 1948 and they established their state Israel on it. The other parts which are West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip were occupied by Israel in a war they started in 1967.<br><br>
From 1048 and until 1988 Palestinian tried the military straggle in order to free Palestine from the Israeli occupation. In 1988 they adopted the peace strategy, which recognize Israel right of existent against the end of occupation on the lands occupied in 1967.<br><br>
Since our nation is not armed, the Palestinian what to show there anger by any mean, and they found that throwing rocks and stones is causing some hearts to the occupation soldiers. This method was first used in the first Intifada in 1987, which continued for more then 7 years and led to peace talks. Intifada includes other ways for protesting like demonstrations and strikes.<br><br>
The Palestinian are protesting the continues Israel occupation by going in to marches and demonstrations and clashing with the Israeli army soldiers (note that Israel ARMY is involved not the POLICE or the RIOTS POLICE) by throwing stones and burning the Israel flag. In return Israeli army replay with LIVE bullets, Rubber coated STEEL bullets, teargas and the international BAND dom-dom bullets, which explode inside the human body and cause heavy injuries.<br><br>
Please visit Amnesty International org. http://www.amnesty.org web site to read there report which condemn Israel for using live bullets in cases which can't be a direct live threat to the soldiers lives.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY CHILDREN'S ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE INTIFADA?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>More then 30 Palestinian Child has been killed by Israel snipers live bullets with direct hits in the head and the heart while they are in the way home from the school, there is a documented stories in this regards, you can read two stories in my site (Sami Abu Jazzar and Moayad Jarawesh both has been killed with there school bags in there shoulders, confirmation photos are there in the site). There are number of other similar stories one of them for a child killed on 20.10.2000 while he was playing at his home veranda with a live bullets by an Israeli sniper. There are more and more cases of killing children's when there are back to homes or even participating in peaceful funerals.<br><br>
Fathers and families are not pushing their children's to participate in Intifada or using them as human shields as per the Zionist media reports. No father in the world will do this even no animal will do it. <br><br>
Not all the Palestinian nation do like PNA position in this crises, majority didn't accept PNA dealing with this case. The Intifada has been started by the people and for one reason only which is to end the occupation. PNA didn't start it and they can't control it today and they will not be apple to end it by any way. <br><br>
The people who protest and clashes with Israeli army are motivated by a natural desire for freedom. Children's goes to school and in the way home, they participate in the demonstration and / or funerals without there families approval and it will be converted by Israeli army to a war by firing there heavy guns towards this children's.<br><br>
I again assure everybody that our families love their children's very much and they try's to protect them in all possible ways. For sure they feel very sad if their children's have been injured and they feel that they lost their own lives if they lost there children's. But Palestinian children's wants to live in freedom like all the children's in the world not under occupation, they don't what to be killed with there school bags in there shoulders, they want to live to enjoy life. For that all, our children's and all the nation are ready to give all what they have even there lives for the freedom of Palestine lands to establish there independent Palestinian state. It is our destiny to fight for our freedom, and we are looking for the world support in our fair and just case.<br><br>
The Palestinian gunmen's are not using the children's as human shields as per Israeli propaganda, there are at the gates of the main Palestinian cities to protect it and prevent the Israeli army from entering to it. In the first months of Intifada, Palestinian gunmen's NEVER killed any Israeli and we have not heard about any injury also in the Israeli side. The international media are showing a false image about what is happing in the occupied lands, they are twisting the truth because the media are owned mainly by Zionist Jews. <br><br>
Even for a few Palestinian gun shoots in the air and not causing Israel any damages or losses, Israel are hitting our Palestinian towns and villages by tanks and helicopter for the nights causing huge number of injures and deaths and they turn it to an equal war.<br><br>
No one wants the Palestinians children on the streets, we want them in their schools and homes enjoying their toys and education. I am also sure that there families are not allowing them to be in the streets and they are not pushing them for participating in Intifada as Zionist media reporting. What I can confirm also, that this children's and their families are frustrated and under heavy brusher from the occupation army, therefore, they go to the street and protest the occupation and even lost there live for that. <br><br>
ALL Palestinians are willing to give their lives for the freedom of their nation.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY PALESTINIANS ARE USING VIOLENCE IN THE INTIFADA?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Palestinians under occupation since 33 years and there rights has been taken by force, therefore, they have all the right to fight the occupation by any mean and using any method to get this rights back. Israeli are returning with live bullets, teargas, rubber coated steel bullets and International band dom-dom bullets against Palestinians protesters and stone-throwers which in no way will be consider a thereat of live to the Israeli soldiers. Please read the Amnesty International report about their findings issued in their site on 19.10.2000 and available in my site, which confirm my above statement.<br><br>
Palestinian are looking for peace and justice and therefore we have gone in peace process and they compromise by giving Israel the right to exists in 78% of historical Palestine, in return they want the 22% remaining which was illegally occupied in 1967. For the last seven years Israel didn't do much for peace and they are keeping their illegal military occupation on the Palestinian lands.<br><br>
We are looking for a peaceful solution which is based on international laws and UN resolutions, but Israel is NOT willing for peace and justice and day by day this FACT is more clear to everybody. <br><br>
The bloodshed has been started by Israel and only Israel can stop it, they even killed 14 Israeli national Arab just because they gone in demonstration.<br><br>
I refer you to Amnesty international organization report about the Al-Aqsa Intifada which state that Israel is using extensive killing force against the Palestinians in situation can't consider a live threat to the soldiers. The report also states that Israel army is using ARMY tactics to POLICE the demonstrations. Also refer to UN resolution, which condemn Israel of using excess force against Palestinians. <br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY THE PALESTINIAN IN RAMALLAH KILLED THE TWO ISRAELIS?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>This two undercover soldiers where with their machine guns in "Area A" which is as per the Israeli signed peace agreements under total control of Palestinians and there are no Jews there. This means that the two Israelis were in Palestinian Area without permission carrying their machine guns, why?<br><br>
Are they going in tour? Are they stupid to go to Ramalla in such time of high tension and "violence"? Why there are caring the machineguns?<br><br>
The International Media were spoken about an assassination mission against Intifada Palestinian leaders in West Bank town of Ramallah, assigned for these soldiers?<br><br>
All reputed media sources said that the crowed broke-in the police station and killed the Israeli after they managed to take control of the police station they have even injured number of the Palestinians police who were trying to stop them. So this is an anger act and when there are hundreds of demonstrators no one can stop them.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHAT IS THE PALESTINIANS REFUGEE ISSUE?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Palestinian Refugee issue is one of the key issues of the peace talks. The 3.7 Millions Palestinian who lost there lands, homes and properties in 1948 war (now Israel). They were bushed to leave homes by Israel terror and during the war to seek a safe place for them and there families. <br><br>
UN issued number of resolutions asking Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees to go back to there own home and lands or to give compensation to the ones refuse to go back. Israel keeps rejecting to implement these resolutions.<br><br>
The other part of refugee, which left the Palestinian lands during 1967 war, should return back after declaring the Palestinian state.<br><br>
In the peace talk Israel suggested to allow less then 10,000 persons to come back during a course of ten years. They refuse to give compensation and they deny their responsibilities on there case. They also refused to allow them to return to West Bank and Gaza Strip, which will be the proposed Palestinian state. <br><br>
This issue still unsolved, and the Palestinian official position is based on the UN resolutions.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY PALESTINIANS ARE LOOSING THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>The Arabs failure in the Public relation campaign is because that the governments control the Arab countries media. The Palestinian people are very much active but with very less capacity and short of financial support.<br><br>
Palestinians are trying to do something on the Internet and there is a good respond from people who wants to know the truth and wants to educate themselves.<br><br>
The USA media and the coverage of the current situation on Palestine without any doubt besides with Israeli since it is a pure Zionist owned media. The media twist the truth to the benefits of Israel. I have come a cross of a good article of a Jewish writer called Norman Solomon about this subject and I like you to read it in Between the Lines section.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHAT IS THE OLD HISTORY OF PALESTINE?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>The first know people in the lands of Palestine were the Canaanites how are Arab from Arab peninsula, they have their own language and culture.<br><br>
Palestine was the land of Palestinian Arab at all ages, Hebrew came to Palestine from Egypt during the third millennium before century, and established a kingdom for a limited number of years then other nations ended there kingdom and ruled the area. Hebrew presence in Palestine was ended since about 130 years after Jesus birth. Arab ruled the area from 638 AD and were always there until today, there introduce Islam, some Arab from deferent countries came and lived in Palestine from the early years to learn and educate the Palestinians. Some of the locals Palestinian converted to Islam and the Islamic rulers give a wide option to every body to keep his religion therefore, there is considerable number of Christian in Palestine but all has adopted the Islamic culture and Arabic language.<br><br>
All the Arab countries know today was under one Islamic empire rule, and it was consider as an emirate or state linked to the capital of the Islamic empire. <br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHAT IS THE CURRENT HISTORY OF PALESTINIAN?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>In the end of 19 century and early 20th century, Palestine (as will as all the adjusting Arab countries) was rules by Turkish (Muslims) in one Islamic empire, the capital was in Istanbul. In the first World War, Arabs were looking to get there independents from Turkish empire to establish there own countries in emirates like Syria, Palestine, Saudi, Iraq, Egypt etc. Therefore they agreed to collaborated with Britain in the W.W.I against promises to help Arab emirates to get there independents after the war from the Islamic Turkish empire. What happens after the war that Britain and France toke control of all Arab countries under what know as Mandate system. Britain toke the mandate on Palestine. In 1917 Jams Aurther Balfour (The Great Britain minister) gave a written promise to the Jews around the world to help them to establish there own home land in Palestine by supporting and facilitating there immigration to Palestine. Immigration started before that date after Zionist movement held their conference in 1897 and set their goal of establishing the Jews homeland on Palestine. Jews started to come to Palestine in mass number with a great help and facility from Britain mandate power which allow them to buy governmental lands and to confiscate a huge Palestinian owned lands to be given to Jews to build there camps and farms. Britain also started to arm the Jews and allowing them to organize themselves, some Zionist armed groups established and worked as the core of the future Israel army like Hagana and others. <br><br>
In 1936 Palestinians started to protest the mandate authority policy and they're beside with Jews. They struggles to push Britain to give them their rights and to stop lands transfer to Jews, to stop the Jews legal and illegal immigration and to stop them from killing the Arabs.<br><br>
In 1947 the Jews groups like Hagana start the war against Arab in order to occupy as much as possible from Arab lands, they were attacking Arab villages and home causing more then 400 massacre killing thousands of Arab Palestinians. All that to force Arab to leave their lands and to immigrate to other countries. In the other hand Arab was trying to defend their families by facing the Jewish groups and attacking them. <br><br>
In 1947 Britain toke the issue of Palestine to the UN to decide about it, there UN issued resolution number 181 about the Partition of Palestine to an Arab country and Jews country with Jerusalem and an International zone. Arab rejected this proposal since it was giving the Jews more land then Arab (Arab were number of times more the Jews). <br><br>
In 1948 Britain decided to leave Palestine and to end the mandate, on the same day, Jews declare there independent state and Arab launch a full-scale war against the new created Jews state. Israel won the war and toke control of 78% of the land of Palestine (all except Gaza Strip and West Bank include east Jerusalem). West Bank was under Jordan administration, Gaza Strip was under Egypt Administration.<br><br>
Because of the massacres and the war, huge number of Palestinians in the lands occupied by the Jewish lifts their homes and become refugees in other Arab countries like Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.<br><br>
In 1967 Israel launch another full-scale war "the six days war" against Arab countries. Israel won the war and occupied Gaza Strip, West Bank, East Jerusalem, Part of Jordan, Part of Syria and Part of Egypt. UN issued a resolution number 242 considering the Israeli occupation illegal and calling Israel to leave the Arab land occupied in 1967 war. Israel rejected all UN resolution related to the Palestine issue.<br><br>
By the full meaning of the word, West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip are occupied territories as per the International Laws and the UN resolutions, even USA approved the 242 resolutions, which consider all the land occupied in 1967 by Israeli as an occupied territories and NOT a part of Israel. <br><br>
Palestinians demands now that Israel should comply to the UN resolution number 242 and leave the Palestine lands occupied in 1967 to allow the Palestine to established there own home land in that lands, as will as solving the related issues such as Palestinian Refugees and Jews settlements in West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br><br>
In the early sixties, PLO established with number of Palestinian fighting groups like Fatah, democratic front and others and start to legitimate freedom straggle against Israel across the boarders and from inside to free the lands and return there rights of having there own state.<br><br>
In 1973, Egypt and Syria launch a war against Israeli and they manage to free some lands of Sinai and the war ended by number of UN agreement.<br><br>
In 1988 Palestinian started to look for a peaceful solution to the conflict based on the International law and Un resolution no 242 and others. In a major compromise, they accepted the existent of Israel on the Palestinian land occupied in 1948, in return they asked Israel to give back the lands occupied in 1967 (West Bank including east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip) to establish the Palestinian state and to live in peace with Israel. All other Arab countries supported the Palestinian in this approach and they also accepted Israel and even started some peace talks with it.<br><br>
After the peace agreement in 13 Sep 1993, Israel allowed a limited self rule to the Palestinians in Parts of Gaza Strip and the parts of West Bank, and the current negotiation is to complete the hand over of all West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinian authority including the east Jerusalem based on UN 242 resolution also to solve other issues such as the 3.7 Millions Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and other issues.<br><br>
Number of other agreement reached though peace talk and Israel withdraw from some land, which is now role by the PNA (Palestinian National authority).<br><br>
There are historical rights to the Palestinian nation of the land of Palestine, they have the right like any other nation of having there own state which will take care of there benefits, they have the right of freedom and to decide for themselves.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WAS THERE A PALESTINIAN STATE BEFORE 1948 OR NOT?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Arabs lived under the control of the Islamic Ottoman Empire for more then 1350 year before the British mandate on Palestine. Before the twentieth century, there were no independent Arab countries; there were only Arab emirates under one Islamic empire. After the World War I and World War II, Arab countries got there independent from the Islamic Ottoman Empire and the modern states were created. Palestine should have been created if Jews did not start migrating to Palestinian lands, with the help of the British.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY THERE WAS NO PALESTINIAN STATE BETWEEN 1948 AND 1967?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Between 1948 and 1967, there was a clear Arab strategy based on freeing all of the Palestine by force, (the same way Israel took it), but unfortunately, they failed. At that time, Palestine was considered to consist of all of the land of Historical Palestine, (the territory occupied by Israel in 1948 and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip). Therefore, Egypt and Jordan refused to establish a homeland for the Palestinian in the West Bank and Gaza Strip waiting to free the rest of the land.<br><br>
Palestinians in 1988 considered the strategy of peace, when they realized that it was not currently possible to free the lands by force.  They recognized the right of Israel to exist and asked Israel to implement the UN resolutions and international law by freeing the occupied territories, which had been forcibly occupied in 1967. Even today, Israel REFUSES to end their illegal military occupation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including all of East Jerusalem.<br><br>
Not only the Arab and Islamic countries consider the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as occupied territories, International law and all relating UN resolution, as well as the whole world, (including the United States), even Israel, (who calls this land the "ADMINISTRATED AREAS," placing it under special law and never considering as a part of Israel), affirm this fact.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY PALESTINIANS ARE USING VIOLANCE AGAINST ISRAEL?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>The Palestinians have been under illegal military occupation since 1967, by the Israeli Defense Force, which keeps them under martial law without any opportunity for freedom. According to international law and the countless of UN resolutions, their occupation is illegal and must end without condition. The Palestinians have the right to fight for their freedom in any possible way; armed struggle is legitimate for any people under occupation. Arabs and Palestinians are officially in a state of war with Israel. The Israeli army is killing Palestinians in the occupied territories on daily basis; they deny them their basic rights. They also reject the Palestinian proposal for peace based on International law and UN resolutions, including 194, 242, and others. <br><br>
Palestinians have the right to fright with Israel army and the Jews settlers inside the occupied lands as will as inside Israel. We DON'T accept in any way the killing of civilians, which we refuse to consider such attacks as legitimate. Jews settlers in occupied lands are armed and more dangers them the Israeli army, there presence in the occupied lands is also ILLEGAL, therefore, we believe that fighting them is legitimate.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHO HAS THE OLDEST AND LONGEST HISTORY IN PALESTINE?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Arab Palestinians have the oldest and the longest history in Palestine, from 638 AD and until today. The first people that lived in Palestine were the Canaans, who immigrated to Palestine from the Arabian Peninsula. In modern history, Jews started to immigrate to Palestine after 1900.<br><br> 
Immigrated Jews to Palestine cannot consider as a nation, they speak dozens of languages; most of them cannot speak it Hebrew; they are of thousands of nationalities, they lack a common history. They are different groups of people with ONLY one thing in common, their religion. On the other hand, the Arab Palestinians speak one language, Arabic; a majority are Muslims (some are Christians or Jews); all have a SINGLE history for more then 1400 years and all have the same traditions and culture.<br><br></p>

<b>Q. WHY DID ARAB COUNIRES FORCE ARAB JEWS TO IMMIGATE TO ISRAEL?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>Most of the Arab Jews left for Israel by their own will, to live in their claimed "promised land." Jews in all the countries used to live in their own neighborhoods, always separating themselves, slamming their doors in the face of being part of the community and this was the case in Europe as well. Therefore, they did not hesitate to immigrate to Israel believing that they would live in an open community. <br><br>
Even today there are number of Arab Jews living in our Arab countries having full rights, like any other citizen, some of them reached have very high levels in government, such as King Mohamed of Morocco adviser and a Jewish parliament member in Bahrain.<br><br>
The day Israel claims independence, they issued the "Return Law", which allows any Jew in the world to return to Israel and have Israeli citizenship. Zionist leaders and the Israeli government asked all Jews to immigrate to Israel; they have even paid for such groups as the Flasha Jews and the Russian Jews to immigrate. <br><br></p>

<b>Q. IS IT TRUE THAT ISRAEL IS THE ONLY DEMOCARATIC COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST?</b><br><br>
<b>A. </b>The following are examples of Israeli democracy: -<br>
·	Disregarding international law by occupying other people land through military force.<br>
·	Refusing to comply with hundreds of UN resolutions.<br>
·	Racism against Arab Israelis.<br>
·	Killing 13 Arab Israelis within a few days, just because there were marches and demonstration in Israel.<br>
·	Racism against Black Jew (Flasha). Forcing them to seek medical treatment in separate hospitals; rejecting their blood donations; Housing them in the poorest areas in Israel and never assigning them a key position in the government.<br>
·	All political parties in Israel are either based on religious and/or ethnic bases and lack a political base except one or two parties. Like Shas, Russian Jews party, Arabs party and others.<br>
·	Minority governments, which are always not able to act, must reach to compensation from the other coalition parties.<br>
·	The assassination of Prime Minister Rabin by his own people.<br>
·	Transplanting thousands of settlers into the occupied lands of the West Bank and Gaza Strip while their arms are killing Palestinians and confiscating there lands and homes.<br>
·	Legalization of the use of torture against Palestinian detainees.<br>
·	Implementation of illegal detention for years without fair trial or without bringing charges.<br>
·	The demolition of homes by hundreds and not granting building permits.<br><br></p>
