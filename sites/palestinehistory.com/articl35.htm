<p>By : Douglas L Perle<br><br>

Dear President Bush;
<br><br>
How many Palestinian homes will be destroyed before there is a stop put to
Mr. Ariel Sharon and the nazi style Army of thugs, who are well equipped
with America’s latest weapons. This so-called “Peace-Loving” Israeli
Government destroyed, this past October 30th, six homes in the west bank.
These were Palestinian homes, of which the taxes and other fees had been
paid to the city and government, as required. Then these same Israelis come
back and bulldoze down these homes, after years of tax payments to the
Government. The Israelis claim that the proper permits were not obtained to
build? Bate and switch? Most likely!
<br><br>
Why, wasn’t the situation resolved with a show of regard for the law and
human respect? The Israeli Government has no respect for anyone not even
those Citizen or Governments it can control. Instead, the thugs of the
Israeli Government destroy more Palestinian homes. This is a daily
occurrence in the occupied territory. We Americans, cannot and will not
stand as partners to this crime. Will we Americans be next? Will we be
subject to this same treatment if we oppose the Israeli Government? The
Israelis, so-called champions of freedom in the Middle East. How can they be
considered champions of democracy when these things are being done? How can
any Israeli Government be supported with open eyes?
<br><br>
ADC President Ziad Asali and Vice President Khalil E. Jahshan emphasized in
their letter that the six-day campaign by the Sharon government has resulted
in dozens of civilian deaths and hundreds of injuries. They specifically
referred to Israeli military actions at Beit Rima, particularly preventing
ambulances and paramedics from rescuing the wounded, as "nothing short of
cold-blooded murder."
<br><br>
Are we the American People not supposed to notice these actions? The Israeli
Government under Arial Sharon or any Israeli leader does not want peace!
These acts are actions of a Government that only wants to make the
Palestinians angry and fight. Thus insuring that Israeli will have no peace
“ Because the Palestinians are fighting back”. And if the Palestinians do
not fight back then Palestinian homes are still bulldozed out of existence.
Because the methods the Israeli Government is using as tactics are exactly
the nazi tactics used against the Jewish people themselves in the nineteen
thirties and forties!
<br><br>
Then when Sharon demands that certain conditions be met for peace
negotiations to start, demands Sharon knows cannot be met. Sharon is blowing
smoke, so nothing will be done and Sharon can continue his insane acts. Is
this really something that is condoned by our Government, Mr. President?
<br><br>
David Ben Gurion said, "Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves
...politically, we are the aggressors and they defend themselves...The
country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and
settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their
country..."
<br><br>
This sums it up well; the Israeli Government is taking away the Palestinian
country all right! And daily another person in the world finds out what the
Israelis are doing to the Palestinians! We fought Iraq for the invasion of
Kuwait! Yet, we ignore the Israeli invasion of Palestinian territory, taking
of land, and murdering people by the Israeli Government!
<br><br>
The people of Israel may be blind to what the Government of Israel is doing.
Mr. President, you cannot close your eyes to this any longer. The world
demands we the United States of America stand up for freedom and justice not
for inhumanity to the world. The double standard, as the rest of the world
sees America! It’s OK to kill Palestinians and destroy Palestinian people’s
homes as long as you’re a “Friend of America”?
<br><br>
Americans will no longer tolerate the “We have American in our pocket”
attitude of Mr. Sharon. The world sees America now and sees America’s
bigoted foreign policy as the real problem! And more and more Americans are
seeing it that way also! We do not want to be seen as being controlled by an
outside country, Israel.. Who, it appears, is dictating foreign policy for
us, Mr. President!
<br><br>
If the Israeli Government is so open, why then are news agencies told to
keep out and they cannot guarantee their safety? And why has the United
States vetoed the implementation of independent observers into Israel. The
real answers are:
<br><br>
THE ISRAELIS AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DO NOT WANT NEWS AGENCIES OR
INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS IN ISRAEL TO REPORT THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, THE
MURDERS, THE DEMOLITION OF HOMES, THE IMPRISONMENT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT LEGAL
DUE PROCESS AND THEIR TORTURE, THE BEATING OF PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS ON THE
STREETS, THE DENIAL OF BASIC RIGHTS TO EARN A LIVING ON AND ON. THEN THE
WORLD WOULD SEE THE TRUE FACE OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT.
<br><br>
Yet, Mr. President, you allow this to continue and we Americans are willing
(?) partners (?) to this perpetration of humanitarian atrocities? Put an end
to the Israeli cancer in the Middle East! If we cannot hold them accountable
then who will?
