<p>
In Nov.4 , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
was assassinated in Tel Aviv by a right-wing
extremist who considered Rabin's crusade for peace
a betrayal of the Jewish state. The prime minister
was shot three times as he was getting into his
car to leave a peace rally 9:30 PM local time .
He was rushed to nearby Ichilov Hospital but had
no heartbeat or blood pressure when admitted to
the emergency room. Doctors tried without success
to revive Rabin, but he was pronounced dead at
11:10 PM. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
took over leadership of the Labor government upon
Rabin's death.</p>
