<p>President of Israel (1983- ), born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1935
Herzog's family immigrated to Palestine, and his father, Isaac Halevy
Herzog, became chief rabbi of Israel . Chaim attended the Government of
Palestine Law School in Jerusalem, Cambridge University, and London
University, where he earned a law degree. During World War II he was a tank
commander with Britain's elite Guard Armored Division; he later directed
British intelligence in Germany, where he identified a captive soldier as
the Nazi chief Heinrich Himmler. After the war he served in the Jewish
underground, Haganah, in Palestine.<br><br>
After serving as a field commander, Herzog became chief of military
intelligence in Israel (1954-62) and then returned to enter private
business. As a radio commentator he became known for his military and
political analyses, especially during the Six Day War (1967) and the
October War (1973), of which he wrote a candid account, The War of
Atonement(1975). Also in 1975, he became Israel's ambassador to the United
Nations, where he denounced the General Assembly's resolution defining
Zionism as racism and defended Israel's rescue of Jewish hostages in Uganda
in 1976. His book The Arab-Israeli Wars(1982) was widely praised. In 1981
he became a Labor party member of Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. Highly
respected by both major political parties, Herzog was elected to five-year
terms as Israel's president in 1983 and 1988.</p><br><br>
