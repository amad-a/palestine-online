<p>In 1973 Egypt joined
Syria in a war on
Israel to regain the
territories lost in
1967. The two Arab
states struck
unexpectedly on October
6, which fell on Yom
Kippur , Israel's
holiest fast day .
After crossing the
suez channel the Arab
forces gain a lot of
advanced positions in
Sinai Peninsula and
Golan Heights and
manage to defeat the
Israeli forces for more
then three weeks .
Israeli forces with a
massive U.S. economic
and military assistance
managed to stop the
arab forces after a
three-week struggle and
defeat with the cost of
many casualties,and the
Arabs strong showing
won them support from
the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics
(USSR) and most of the
world's developing
countries.<br><br>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait financed the Arab forces,
making it possible for Egypt and Syria to receive
the most sophisticated Soviet weapons , and the
Arab oil producing states cut off petroleum
exports to the United States and other Western
nations in retaliation for their aid to Israel.<br><br>
Israel, forced to compete with the nearly
unlimited Arab resources, was faced with a serious
financial setback. Only massive U.S. economic and
military assistance enabled it to redress the
balance, but even American aid was unable to
prevent a downward spiral of the economy.<br><br>
In an effort to encourage a peace settlement, U.S.
President Richard M. Nixon charged his secretary
of state, Henry Kissinger, with the task of
negotiating agreements between Israel and Egypt
and Syria. Kissinger managed to work out military
disengagements between Israel and Egypt in the
Sinai and between Israel and Syria in the Golan
Heights during 1974.</p>
