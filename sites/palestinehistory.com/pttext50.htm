<p>In Feb.2 , In an effort to make progress in the
stalled Middle East peace talks, Egypt invited
representatives from Israel, Jordan, and the
Palestine Liberation Organization to a summit
meeting in Cairo. The meeting was the first
regional summit in which an Israeli official
participated. After nearly six hours of talks, the
leaders issued a joint statement in which they
agreed to forge ahead with efforts for peace,
condemned political violence, and called for more
international assistance for the Palestinian
Authority, the governing body in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The peace talks, which began in 1992,
had been threatened by increasing Islamic militant
attacked against Israelis.</p>
