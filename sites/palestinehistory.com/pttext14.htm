<p>Attempts to
convert the
Israeli - Arab
armistice
agreements into
peace treaties
failed .
The Arabs insisted that the refugees be permitted
to return to their homes, that Jerusalem be
internationalized, and that Israel make
territorial concessions before they entered peace
talks. Israel charged that these demands would
undermine its security and refused them.<br><br>
Frequent incursions by refugee guerrilla bands and
attacks by Arab military units were made, which
Israel answered with forceful retaliation. Egypt
refused to permit Israeli ships to use the Suez
Canal and blockaded the Straits of Tiran (Israel's
access to the Red Sea), which was seen as an act
of war. Border incidents along the frontiers with
Egypt escalated until they erupted in the second
Arab-Israeli War in October and November of 1956.<br><br>
Great Britain and France ostensibly joined the
attack because of their dispute with Egypt's
president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just
nationalized the Suez Canal. Nasser took over the
canal after Great Britain and France withdrew
offers to finance the construction of the Aswân
High Dam. Israel scored a quick victory, seizing
the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula within a
few days. As Israeli forces reached the banks of
the Suez Canal, the British and French started
their attack. The fighting was halted by the UN
after a few days, and a UN Emergency Force (UNEF)
was sent to supervise the cease-fire in the Canal
zone. In a rare instance of cooperation, the
United States and the Soviet Union supported the
UN resolution forcing the three invading countries
to leave Egypt and Gaza. By the end of the year
their forces withdrew from Egypt, but Israel
refused to leave Gaza until early 1957, and only
after the United States had promised to help
resolve the conflict and keep the Straits of Tiran
open.</p>
