<p>“The horrors of the Nazi holocaust suffered by the Jewish community over 50
years ago have been politically appropriated by Israel to position itself as
a perennial potential victim surrounded by implacable foes. But, over the
years, Israel has, by its own actions, undermined all this goodwill. From
being the oppressed, it has turned oppressor with a vengeance. It is no
one's contention that the Israelis stand by and be attacked by armed
Palestinian youth. But does any civilized nation respond to stones by
opening up with heavy artillery and helicopter gun ships?” THE TIMES OF

“Besides its financial cost, unwavering U.S. support for Israel, whether
it's right or wrong, exacts a huge price in American prestige and
credibility overseas. Further, Israel's powerful U.S. lobby has been a major
factor in delaying campaign finance reform, and also in the removal from
American political life of some of our most distinguished public servants,
members of Congress and even presidents.”
<br><br>
“The financial cost of Israel to U.S. taxpayers. Between 1949 and 1998, the
U.S. gave to Israel, with a self-declared population of 5.8 million people,
more foreign aid than it gave to all of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa,
all of the countries of Latin America, and all of the countries of the
Caribbean combined - with a total population of 1,054,000,000 people.”
<br><br>
In the 1997 fiscal year, for example, Israel received $3 billion from the
foreign aid budget, at least $525 million from other U.S. budgets, and $2
billion in federal loan guarantees. So the 1997 total of U.S. grants and
loan guarantees to Israel was $5.5 billion. That's $15,068,493 per day, 365
days a year.
<br><br>
If you add its foreign aid grants and loans, plus the approximate totals of
grants to Israel from other parts of the U.S. federal budget, Israel has
received since 1949 a grand total of $84.8 billion, excluding the $10
billion in U.S. government loan guarantees it has drawn to date. And if you
calculate what the U.S. has had to pay in interest to borrow this money to
give to Israel, the cost of Israel to U.S. taxpayers rises to $134.8
billion, not adjusted for inflation. Richard Curtiss

Where is the Stability from this in the Middle East? We the American Tax
payer got zero stability for our tax dollars donated to Israel. However, we
did get total hatred from all nations surrounding the Israel boarders. The
only way we have benefited is in selling the arms to Israel to murder other
people.
<br><br>
Our own Government cannot build and run a housing project for the poor! Our
own Government cannot even solve the Indian problem in America! Americas
Indians are the poorest people on this planet outside of INDIA!
<br><br>
How is it that the U.S. Government believes it can solve any problems in the
Middle East? The usual theory is if you throw enough money at the problem it
will go away? In this case that has not helped either side.
<br><br>
One side has all the large weapons of mass destruction and the other side
has human bombs, not paid for with U.S. Dollars.
<br><br>
In this case the Palestinians have lost the inner fear of the Israeli
Government. Palestinians have had enough of the Israeli gun ships, armor ,
and f-16s. They are fighting back with rocks, small arms, and their own
people as weapons to stop the Israeli slaughtering and taking of Palestinian
land.
<br><br>
Peace talks, for the last eight years, have not stopped the Israelis from
building more settlements on occupied land. The so called peace talks has
given time for the Israelis to build more settlements. Israel will not give
up anything in an effort to gain peace. And what do the Palestinians have
that they can give up? More land? 3.7 million lives? Most of them in refugee
camps. Israel doesn't want peace, Israel only wants all of the Palestinian
land!
<br><br>
We need to stop supporting this insane $5.5 billion dollar death machine and
put and end to the murder of a nation and its people!
<br><br>
Each and everyone send this to someone you know and also sent it to our
president@whitehouse.gov . Then please let me know how many you sent this
message to!
<br><br>
We, you and I American Citizens, can not afford Israel. Not at the cost of
the rest of the worlds life! If we are to change this illogical foreign
policy we must all voice our concern directly to the top of the political
heap. And make ourselves heard loudly. Like a shot heard around the world
the pen is better than a bullet!

Thank you
