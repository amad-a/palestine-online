The Text of the petition..
<BR><BR>
Mister President, we strongly appeal to you in the name of humanity and civil human rights as a leader of the free world, to order the Israeli Government for an immediate and obligatory ending of their illegal occupation on the Palestinian lands, the Israeli army day to day violation of unarmed civilians human rights, their acts against the medical staff and the International medical support organizations which prohibit them in doing their civilian duties and the Israel blocking on the free press and media in a fair and actual cover of the recent aggression in the Palestinian lands in West Bank and Gaza Strip.
<BR><BR>
Mister President, we strongly appeal to you to support the rights of the Palestinian nation and to immediately interfere to stop the growing chances of a true human disaster on the medical, social  and political levels which endanger the chances of PEACE in the future and lead the area for more tension and a wider conflict. The people of this lands has the right to live in peace and to enjoy their human and political rights in a fair and equal level with other people around the world.
<BR><BR>
Mister President, the Palestinian nation is not an immigrants or foreign people, they are the original inhabitants of this land since thousands of years. Therefore, the Palestinian nation   has the legal, human, civil and legitimate rights to defend their own existence, lands, properties and their nationhood similar to any other nation under illegal military occupation in other parts of the world, using all legitimate methods to defend themselves. Remember Mister President, that all Arab Nations selected the peace and the last proof is the Latest Arab Peace Proposal.
<BR><BR>
We demand that you have your own Peace Proposal based on the United Nation and International Law to force Israel to accept the Arab Peace Proposal and to implement it on a fixed, short-term and compulsory schedule under supervision of independent international monitoring and control. 
<BR><BR>
Millions of free people around the world are appealing to you to stand side by side of the innocent people of Palestine and to stop the ethnic cleansing war ongoing by the Israel army against them for the last days.
