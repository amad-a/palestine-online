The Framework for Peace in the Middle East<br><br>
September 17, 1978<br><br>
Muhammad Anwar al-Sadat, President of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, met with
Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, at
Camp David from September 5 to September 17, 1978, and have
agreed on the following framework for peace in the Middle East.
They invite other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere
to it.<br><br>
Preamble<br><br>
The search for peace in the Middle East must be guided by the
following:<br><br>
The agreed basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict
between Israel and its neighbors is United Nations Security
Council Resolution 242, in all its parts.<br><br>
After four wars during 30 years, despite intensive human
efforts, the Middle East, which is the cradle of civilization
and the birthplace of three great religions, does not enjoy the
blessings of peace. The people of the Middle East yearn for
peace so that the vast human and natural resources of the
region can be turned to the pursuits of peace and so that this
area can become a model for coexistence and cooperation among
nations.<br><br>
The historic initiative of President Sadat in visiting
Jerusalem and the reception accorded to him by the parliament,
government and people of Israel, and the reciprocal visit of
Prime Minister Begin to Ismailia, the peace proposals made by
both leaders, as well as the warm reception of these missions
by the peoples of both countries, have created an unprecedented
opportunity for peace which must not be lost if this generation
and future generations are to be spared the tragedies of war.<br><br>
The provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the
other accepted norms of international law and legitimacy now
provide accepted standards for the conduct of relations among
all states.<br><br>
To achieve a relationship of peace, in the spirit of Article 2
of the United Nations Charter, future negotiations between
Israel and any neighbor prepared to negotiate peace and
security with it are necessary for the purpose of carrying out
all the provisions and principles of Resolutions 242 and 338.<br><br>
Peace requires respect for the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of every state in the area
and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized
boundaries free from threats or acts of force. Progress toward
that goal can accelerate movement toward a new era of
reconciliation in the Middle East marked by cooperation in
promoting economic development, in maintaining stability and in
assuring security.<br><br>
Security is enhanced by a relationship of peace and by
cooperation between nations which enjoy normal relations. In
addition, under the terms of peace treaties, the parties can,
on the basis of reciprocity, agree to special security
arrangements such as demilitarized zones, limited armaments
areas, early warning stations, the presence of international
forces, liaison, agreed measures for monitoring and other
arrangements that they agree are useful.<br><br>
Framework<br><br>
Taking these factors into account, the parties are determined
to reach a just, comprehensive, and durable settlement of the
Middle East conflict through the conclusion of peace treaties
based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 in all their
parts. Their purpose is to achieve peace and good neighborly
relations. They recognize that for peace to endure, it must
involve all those who have been most deeply affected by the
conflict. They therefore agree that this framework, as
appropriate, is intended by them to constitute a basis for
peace not only between Egypt and Israel, but also between
Israel and each of its other neighbors which is prepared to
negotiate peace with Israel on this basis. With that objective
in mind, they have agreed to proceed as follows:<br><br>
A. West Bank and Gaza<br><br>
Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the representatives of the
Palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the
resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. To
achieve that objective, negotiations relating to the West Bank
and Gaza should proceed in three stages:<br><br>
Egypt and Israel agree that, in order to ensure a peaceful and
orderly transfer of authority, and taking into account the
security concerns of all the parties, there should be
transitional arrangements for the West Bank and Gaza for a
period not exceeding five years. In order to provide full
autonomy to the inhabitants, under these arrangements the
Israeli military government and its civilian administration
will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has
been freely elected by the inhabitants of these areas to
replace the existing military government. To negotiate the
details of a transitional arrangement, Jordan will be invited
to join the negotiations on the basis of this framework. These
new arrangements should give due consideration both to the
principle of self-government by the inhabitants of these
territories and to the legitimate security concerns of the
parties involved.<br><br>
Egypt, Israel, and Jordan will agree on the modalities for
establishing elected self-governing authority in the West Bank
and Gaza. The delegations of Egypt and Jordan may include
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza or other Palestinians
as mutually agreed. The parties will negotiate an agreement
which will define the powers and responsibilities of the
self-governing authority to be exercised in the West Bank and
Gaza. A withdrawal of Israeli armed forces will take place and
there will be a redeployment of the remaining Israeli forces
into specified security locations. The agreement will also
include arrangements for assuring internal and external
security and public order. A strong local police force will be
established, which may include Jordanian citizens. In addition,
Israeli and Jordanian forces will participate in joint patrols
and in the manning of control posts to assure the security of
the borders.<br><br>
When the self-governing authority (administrative council) in
the West Bank and Gaza is established and inaugurated, the
transitional period of five years will begin. As soon as
possible, but not later than the third year after the beginning
of the transitional period, negotiations will take place to
determine the final status of the West Bank and Gaza and its
relationship with its neighbors and to conclude a peace treaty
between Israel and Jordan by the end of the transitional
period. These negotiations will be conducted among Egypt,
Israel, Jordan and the elected representatives of the
inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza. Two separate but related
committees will be convened, one committee, consisting of
representatives of the four parties which will negotiate and
agree on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza, and its
relationship with its neighbors, and the second committee,
consisting of representatives of Israel and representatives of
Jordan to be joined by the elected representatives of the
inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza, to negotiate the peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan, taking into account the
agreement reached in the final status of the West Bank and
Gaza. The negotiations shall be based on all the provisions and
principles of UN Security Council Resolution 242. The
negotiations will resolve, among other matters, the location of
the boundaries and the nature of the security arrangements. The
solution from the negotiations must also recognize the
legitimate right of the Palestinian peoples and their just
requirements. In this way, the Palestinians will participate in
the determination of their own future through:<br><br>
The negotiations among Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the
representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza to
agree on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza and other
outstanding issues by the end of the transitional period.
Submitting their agreements to a vote by the elected
representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza.
Providing for the elected representatives of the inhabitants of
the West Bank and Gaza to decide how they shall govern
themselves consistent with the provisions of their agreement.
Participating as stated above in the work of the committee
negotiating the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan.<br><br>
All necessary measures will be taken and provisions made to
assure the security of Israel and its neighbors during the
transitional period and beyond. To assist in providing such
security, a strong local police force will be constituted by
the self-governing authority. It will be composed of
inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza. The police will maintain
liaison on internal security matters with the designated
Israeli, Jordanian, and Egyptian officers.<br><br>
During the transitional period, representatives of Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, and the self-governing authority will
constitute a continuing committee to decide by agreement on the
modalities of admission of persons displaced from the West Bank
and Gaza in 1967, together with necessary measures to prevent
disruption and disorder. Other matters of common concern may
also be dealt with by this committee.<br><br>
Egypt and Israel will work with each other and with other
interested parties to establish agreed procedures for a prompt,
just and permanent implementation of the resolution of the
refugee problem.<br><br>
B. Egypt-Israel<br><br>
Egypt-Israel undertake not to resort to the threat or the use
of force to settle disputes. Any disputes shall be settled by
peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of Article 33
of the U.N. Charter.<br><br>
n order to achieve peace between them, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith with a goal of concluding within three
months from the signing of the Framework a peace treaty between
them while inviting the other parties to the conflict to
proceed simultaneously to negotiate and conclude similar peace
treaties with a view the achieving a comprehensive peace in the
area. The Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty
between Egypt and Israel will govern the peace negotiations
between them. The parties will agree on the modalities and the
timetable for the implementation of their obligations under the
treaty.<br><br>
C. Associated Principles<br><br>
Egypt and Israel state that the principles and provisions
described below should apply to peace treaties between Israel
and each of its neighbors - Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.<br><br>
Signatories shall establish among themselves relationships
normal to states at peace with one another. To this end, they
should undertake to abide by all the provisions of the U.N.
Charter. Steps to be taken in this respect include:<br><br>
full recognition;<br><br>
abolishing economic boycotts;<br><br>
guaranteeing that under their jurisdiction the citizens of the
other parties shall enjoy the protection of the due process of
law.<br><br>
Signatories should explore possibilities for economic
development in the context of final peace treaties, with the
objective of contributing to the atmosphere of peace,
cooperation and friendship which is their common goal.<br><br>
Claims commissions may be established for the mutual settlement
of all financial claims.<br><br>
The United States shall be invited to participated in the talks
on matters related to the modalities of the implementation of
the agreements and working out the timetable for the carrying
out of the obligations of the parties.<br><br>
The United Nations Security Council shall be requested to
endorse the peace treaties and ensure that their provisions
shall not be violated. The permanent members of the Security
Council shall be requested to underwrite the peace treaties and
ensure respect or the provisions. They shall be requested to
conform their policies an actions with the undertaking
contained in this Framework.<br><br>
