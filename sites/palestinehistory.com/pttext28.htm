<p>In May'94 , At a ceremony in Cairo,
Egypt, attended by 2,500 guests, Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), and
Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of
Israel, signed the final version of the
Declaration of Principles that had been
signed in Washington, D.C., on Sept.
13, 1993.<br><br>
The accord was regarded as a start toward bringing
peace between Israelis and Palestinians after 45
years of conflict. Within 24 hours of the signing,
Israeli military forces were scheduled to leave
the Gaza Strip and Jericho, ending 27 years of
occupation of those territories. A Palestinian
police force was ready to move into the areas to
keep order. Among the foreign visitors at the
ceremony were Secretary of State Warren
Christopher of the United States, Foreign Minister
Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia, and Foreign Minister
Koji Kazikawa of Japan. In spite of the accord,
Jewish and Palestinian extremists in Israel vowed
to prevent its full implementation.</p>
