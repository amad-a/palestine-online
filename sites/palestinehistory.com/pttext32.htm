On December 11, Palestinian census takers stand in
the rain, knocking on people's doors in
traditionally-Arab east Jerusalem. But many
residents literally hide behind their closed
doors, fearing a census which anywhere else would
be an exercise in basic civics. Even answering
questions as simple as "Do you have central
heating?" can be risky. East Jerusalem's
Palestinians do not allow themselves to be
photographed, for fear that Israeli authorities
will revoke their residency cards and evict them
from the city where their families have lived
for centuries. The first-ever Palestinian census
turned into a tug-of-war over Jerusalem when
Israel's government pushed a bill through
Parliament blocking Yasser Arafat's census-takers
from operating in the disputed city.</p>
