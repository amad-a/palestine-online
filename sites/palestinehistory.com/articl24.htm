I am a german Mother of 2 kids, in the ages 13 and 6. And it took me along
time to see what is happening in Palestine, but finally i got the truth. It
is terrible to see what Israel is doing to Palestine, specially with the
children.
<br><br>
I spend sometime thinking, why? Why the children?
<br><br>
How dangerous can babies ( 2,4,18 month old) children on there way to
school, and teenagers with stones really be?
<br><br>
Ben Gurion said:"The old will die and the Young will forget",on getting ride
of palestinians. Yes and many died, but the young ones did not and don't
forget.
<br><br>
That is why they are dangerous, that is why the are killed.
<br><br>
Nowhere in this world need a mother more frighten about the life of her
children as in palestine.
<br><br>
They children are killed on playgrounds, coming or going to school, or just
in the car with their parents going some where.
<br><br>
Nowhere else in this world must a mother listen to: You are sending your
child to frontier, you are sacrificing you childern life, you race your child
to be a terrorist, only in palestine.
<br><br>
People who believe that are either real stupid or never had a child on his
own.
<br><br>
In Palestine are living 3 Million palestinians, 5.3 Millions all over the
world. Their children don't have the right to be born in their country, in
their religion or traditions.
<br><br>
Well i hope and pray for all this to come to an end soon.
<br><br>
Let the children of palestine live in Peace, in their country.
<br><br>
Fi aman Falesteen. God with you Palestine
