<p>After World War I ended in 1918, Jews began to
migrate to Palestine, which was set aside as a
British mandate with the approval of the League of
Nations in 1922.<br><br>
After World War I the terms of the Balfour
Declaration were included in the mandate for
Palestine approved by the League of Nations in
1922. The mandate entrusted Great Britain with
administering Palestine and with assisting the
Jewish people in “reconstituting their national
home in that country.”<br><br>
Large-scale Jewish settlement and development of
extensive Zionist agricultural and industrial
enterprises in Palestine began during the British
mandatory period, which lasted until 1948. The
Jewish community, or Yishuv, increased tenfold
during this era, especially during the 1930s, when
large numbers of Jews fled Europe to escape
persecution by the Nazis. Tel Aviv became the
country's largest all-Jewish city, dozens of other
towns and villages were founded, and hundreds of
Jewish agricultural collectives (kibbutzim) and
cooperatives were established.<br><br>
Many Jewish political parties founded in Eastern
Europe as part of the world Zionist movement
developed bases in mandatory Palestine. They
included labor, orthodox religious, and
nationalist groups whose leaders emigrated from
Europe and after 1948 became political leaders and
officials in the new Jewish state.<br><br>
The Yishuv extended its institutions after World
War I. Among these institutions was an assembly
with a National Council that managed the
community's day-to-day affairs in education,
health, social welfare, and other services. Jewish
religious life was supervised by a Rabbinical
Council that controlled marriage, divorce, and
other family matters. Local government
institutions were also developed to run the city
of Tel Aviv and many smaller Jewish settlements.
The educational system, cultivating Hebrew
language and culture, expanded, and the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem was founded.<br><br>
The World Zionist Organization and the Jewish
Agency for Palestine assisted the Yishuv by
raising funds abroad, recruiting Jewish
immigrants, and seeking political support from
Western governments.</p>
