<center><b><font size="+3" color="Blue"> 1945 - Britain's Palestine Dilemma </font></b></center>
<p>With World War II over and the Nazi death camps
open for the world to see, Zionists redoubled
their demands that Britain open its Palestine
mandate to unlimited Jewish immigration.<br><br>
Jewish terrorist groups the Irgun Zvei Lumi and
the Stern Gang escalated their campaign to force
Britain's hand.<br><br>
Arabs in the region opposed a Jewish influx, but
in Palestine itself they lacked unified
leadership. So in March 1945, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Lebanon, Iraq, Transjordan, Yemen, and Egypt
organized the League of Arab States to pressure
Britain from the other side. Britain's new labour
government (unlike its predecessor) strongly
sympathized with Zionism's goal, yet it hoped to
remain friendly with the Arabs. Adding to the
British quandary was President Truman. whose
Zionist leanings were clear. In April 1946,
yielding to U. S. pressure, Britain sent yet
another commission to study the issue. The
Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry recommended
that 100,000 European Jewish refugees be admitted
immediately, that restrictions on Jewish land
purchases in Palestine be lifted, and that a
binational Jewish-Arab state be established under
United Nations trusteeship. Faced with the
political and economic costs of policing
Palestine, the British gladly turned the matter
over to the UN. In 1947 the UN sent its own
commission to seek answers to the Palestine
problem. The result, the following year, was the
founding of Israel and a war between the Jewish
and Arab.</p>
