<p>
In July 24 , A Palestinian martyr bomber set off
a crude pipe bomb aboard a bus making its way
through morning rush hour in a suburb of Tel Aviv,
Israel, killing himself and six others. More than
32 passengers were wounded in the attack. The
bombing was the first major instance of attacks
against Israel in more than three months, and it
came one day before negotiators from Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization were to have
reached an agreement on extending Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin vowed that the attacks would not
stop the talks from moving forward, and he
credited Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian
Authority for taking positive actions to prevent
such attacks from taking place.</p>
