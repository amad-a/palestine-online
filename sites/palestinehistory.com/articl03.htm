<p>By Andrew Getman with Dianne Roe<br><br>
Two foreign journalists, Andrew Getman and Dianne Roe, visitied Hebron
Yesterday where they witnessed Israel's bloody repression of the
Palestinians.
<br><br>Here is their report:<br><br>
Today we went to Baab i-Zawiyye, the open central square at the beginning
of the Hebron shopping district, expecting that there would be a
demonstration. There was a large group of shebaab (young Arab men) standing
around waiting for something to happen. We were talking about the situation
with several people on the street, including a teacher we know from Sa'ir,
when suddenly, shots burst out. Everybody ducked and ran for cover. When it
was clear that no one had been hit, people began vacating the area. It
seemed that there would be little activity that afternoon, so we made a
plan with the teacher to visit some families near his village, telling him
that we would return in a half an hour.
<br><br>
When we returned we could not find our friend. As we looked around for him,
and conversed with some other men in the square, suddenly a shot was fired.
We did not know where it came from, but the crowd began running away from
Baab i-Zawiyye. As those with whom we were talking with did not start
running, we could not see a reason for people to flee. A crowd gathered
about 75 meters up the street and the rumour spread that a Jewish man
disguised as an Arab had shot someone and disappeared into the crowd.
<br><br>
At first, it was impossible to see through the crowd clustering around the
spot where the injured man had fallen, discussing the situation, and
chanting "Allahu akbar." His body had already been put into an ambulance,
leaving behind a small river of thick blood flowing down the street.
<br><br>
But the source of the single shot could not be determined. Another rumour
spread that the gunman must be stationed in a particular window or balcony,
known to be occupied by soldiers, that overlooks the square. As young men
placed stones to mark the area where the body fell, we obtained the story
from eyewitnesses: the injured man, a taxi driver, named Fayez Mohamed
al-Qemary, was hit in the back of his head by a bullet while he was
cleaning his car. He fell in the street; parts of his brain were visible.
He was standing at least 80 meters from the demonstrators, and 150 meters
from the soldiers.
<br><br>
People who spoke English asked us what we thought of the situation. But
invariably they wanted to voice their frustration, saying, "What can we do?
How can we protect ourselves against such indiscriminate aggression? How
can we even effectively protest? The media ignores this situation. The
newspapers focus on the soldiers kidnapped by Hizbollah, but ignore how
civilian homes are fired on from Israeli helicopters. The international
press reports how soldiers were lynched in Ramallah, but ignores the
lynchings done by settlers earlier that same week in Nazareth, Beit Furiq,
and Umm Safa."
<br><br>
We went to al-Alia Governmental Hospital in Hebron to hear the doctor's
report; a solemn crowd had gathered outside. Mr. al-Qemary was 30 years
old, the father of three children, shot at 1:45 pm, and declared dead at
2:45 pm. His mother emerged from the hospital wailing and moaning,
supported by two men. His father emerged and sat on the curb, slapping his
head with both hands, as an imam tried to console him by quoting verses of
the Qur'an. Stunned and tearful family members were offered transportation
home in waiting taxis.
<br><br>
A group of men carried the shrouded body out of the hospital and down the
street. While Muslim tradition urges respect for the body of the dead
person, and therefore discourages autopsies, it was still possible for
doctors to determine from the size of the wound that either a high velocity
or possibly an exploding bullet was used.
<br><br>
Al-Qemary is the second unarmed bystander killed in this area. On Friday,
October 13, Mansour Saied Akhmad, 22, was shot while observing rock
throwers about 50 meters from the soldiers. X-rays indicated that an
exploding bullet had inflicted his abdominal wound Throughout the day, even
before al-Qemary was shot, different people approached us, saying, "Tell
the world that Palestinians need international protection." A student who
had been with us when the shooting occurred was still with us as we walked
away from the hospital. The IDF has fired bullets into his bedroom during
the past two weeks. As he headed toward his home in the Hart i-Sheikh
neighborhood, he said, "Tonight it will be worse."
