<p>In August 1929, the
century's first
large-scale attack on
Jews by Arabs rocked
Jerusalem. The riots, in
which Palestinians
killed 133 Jews and
suffered 116 deaths.<br><br>
Mostly inflicted by British
troops were sparked by a dispute over use of the
Western Wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the site is sacred
to Muslims,but Jews claimed it is the remaining of
old jews temple ( all studies shows clearly that
the wall is from the Islamic ages and it is part
of al-Aqsa Mosque). But the roots of the violence
lay deeper in Arab fears of the burgeoning Zionist
movement, which aimed to make at least part of
British-administered Palestine a Jewish state.<br><br>
The British had made promises to both Arabs and
Zionists. The 1917 Balfour Declaration supported
the establishment of a "national home" for the
Jews, while pledging that nothing would be done to
" prejudice the civil and religious rights" of the
Arabs. But the very presence of a Jewish homeland
would, Arabs insisted, infringe on those rights.</p>
