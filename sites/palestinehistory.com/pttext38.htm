<p>For almost two
years, Colonel Gamal
Abdal Nasser had
quietly directed
Egypt's revolution
from above, while
General Muhammad
Naguib served as
president and prime
minister.<br><br>
February 1954, the colonel stepped to the fore.
Citing Naguib's ties to the banned Muslim
Brotherhood and his intention to restore the old
system of government, Nasser forced him to resign.
In April, Nasser took over the premiership.</p>
