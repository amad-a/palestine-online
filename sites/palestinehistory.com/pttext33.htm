proposals could be "a beginning" towards
resuscitating the deadlocked 5-year-old peace
process. But Arafat, attending a commemoration of
the fifth anniversary of the Oslo peace accords,
also accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of policies in the past two years that
had fostered "despair, hate and violence." Arafat

the West Bank in return for Palestinian moves
against anti-Israel guerrillas would be acceptable

Netanyahu said Tuesday that a deal on a
long-elusive Israeli troop redeployment in the

Yasser Arafat was sounding a "new tone" on
peacemaking, but that it remained to be seen if
Arafat would meet key Israeli demands to seal a
U.S.-brokered withdrawal deal. "Progress is linked
to the Palestinian fight and actions against the
kind of murderers who acted here," Netanyahu said.<br><br>

Aviv since a martyr bomber killed three Israeli
women in a cafe in March 1997. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, citing the blast and the
recent killings of three Jewish settlers in the
West Bank, said he would not sign any deal to cede
more West Bank land to the Palestinian Authority
unless it fought "murderers and terror."<br><br>

Strip and put its troops on alert to guard against
attacks by the group whose bombers have killed
scores of Israelis. Israeli troops killed the two
Palestinian brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah
during a West Bank clash Thursday. Israel long had
sought both of them as leaders of the Hamas
military wing.<br><br>
18.09.98 , U.S. President Bill Clinton's special
envoy extended his Middle East peace mission
Friday, saying he was making headway towards
ending a 19-month-old deadlock between Israel and
the Palestinians. While envoy Dennis Ross pursued
a land-and-security deal, Israeli soldiers firing
rubber-coated metal bullets wounded 10
Palestinians during unrest in the West Bank,

Gaza. It was Ross's most optimistic assessment
since he arrived in the region.<br><br>

Jewish settlers in the West Bank.<br><br>

Netanyahu Wednesday in a fresh attempt to bring
peace negotiations with the Palestinians to
closure. Officials said U.S. mediator Dennis Ross
had made "modest" progress on a mission to the
Middle East last week. This has raised hopes that
protracted negotiations on a deal giving
Palestinians control over 13% more West Bank land
could be wrapped up in the next five or six days
when Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat are in New York for the opening of the U.N.
General Assembly.<br><br>

resignation of top Palestinian peace negotiator

chief negotiator over differences with other
officials on the handling of talks. Hassan Asfour,

between Arafat and Erekat in Gaza Tuesday at which
the Palestinian leader turned down Erekat's
resignation.<br><br>

addresses the U.N. General Assembly Monday as he
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
appear close to agreement on key points in the
long-stalled Middle East peace process. His speech
is considered crucial following requests from U.S.
officials that he not repeat his pledge to declare
unilaterally a Palestinian state on May 4. That is
the date when the 1993 Oslo peace accords that
provide the framework for a Middle East agreement
expire. Such a declaration in the United Nations,
which would make it official, would enrage Israel
and Netanyahu has warned it could scuttle the
peace talks.<br><br>

President Yasser Arafat Tuesday in a bid to narrow
differences to reach accord on a controversial new
round of Israeli troop withdrawals from the West

police pushed demonstrators back into
Palestinian-controlled areas of the city. It was

arrive in Israel on Dec. 12 and is to fly to the

passions for statehood, President Clinton stood
witness Monday as hundreds of Palestinian leaders
renounced a call for the destruction of Israel.
Clinton urged "legitimate rights for Palestinians,
real security for Israel." The Palestinian vote -
registered with a show of hands and applause -
removed a contentious issue dating back to 1964
from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process.
The action appeared to have cleared the way for a
three-way meeting among Clinton, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. At stake was the revival of
the Wye River land-for-security accord, nearing
collapse with Israelis and the Palestinians
accusing each other of violating the deal .<br><br>

persuade Israel to resume the West Bank troop
withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace
accord, but he held out hope the pull back would

we will get through this just fine," he said.
Speaking to American reporters after a 90-minute
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at
this border outpost, Clinton called his three-day
Mideast trip a success. In remarks to reporters
later, Sandy Berger, the president's national
security adviser, qualified Clinton's remark about
the peace process being back on track. "It's a
bumpy track," he said with a smile .<br><br>

Israeli parliament is scheduled to vote today on
the suspension.<br><br>
