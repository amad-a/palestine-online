<div align="center"><font size="+3" color="blue"> The wickedness and awesome cruelty of a crushed and humiliated people </font></div>
<p>By Robert Fisk<br>
12 September 2001
<br><br>
So it has come to this. The entire modern history of the Middle East the
collapse of the Ottoman empire, the Balfour declaration, Lawrence of
Arabia's lies, the Arab revolt, the foundation of the state of Israel, four
Arab-Israeli wars and the 34 years of Israel's brutal occupation of Arab
land all erased within hours as those who claim to represent a crushed,
humiliated population struck back with the wickedness and awesome cruelty of
a doomed people. Is it fair ! is it moral ! to write this so soon, without
proof, when the last act of barbarism, in Oklahoma, turned out to be the
work of home-grown Americans? I fear it is. America is at war and, unless I
am mistaken, many thousands more are now scheduled to die in the Middle
East, perhaps in America too. Some of us warned of "the explosion to come".
But we never dreamt this nightmare.
<br><br>
And yes, Osama bin Laden comes to mind, his money, his theology, his
frightening dedication to destroy American power. I have sat in front of bin
Laden as he described how his men helped to destroy the Russian army in
Afghanistan and thus the Soviet Union. Their boundless confidence allowed
them to declare war on America. But this is not the war of democracy versus
terror that the world will be asked to believe in the coming days. It is
also about American missiles smashing into Palestinian homes and US
helicopters firing missiles into a Lebanese ambulance in 1996 and American
shells crashing into a village called Qana and about a Lebanese militia paid
and uniformed by America's Israeli ally hacking and raping and murdering
their way through refugee camps.
<br><br>
No, there is no doubting the utter, indescribable evil of what has happened
in the United States. That Palestinians could celebrate the massacre of
20,000, perhaps 35,000 innocent people is not only a symbol of their despair
but of their political immaturity, of their failure to grasp what they had
always been accusing their Israeli enemies of doing: acting
disproportionately. All the years of rhetoric, all the promises to strike at
the heart of America, to cut off the head of "the American snake" we took
for empty threats. How could a backward, conservative, undemocratic and
corrupt group of regimes and small, violent organisations fulfil such
preposterous promises? Now we know.
<br><br>
And in the hours that followed yesterday's annihilation, I began to remember
those other extraordinary assaults upon the US and its allies, miniature now
by comparison with yesterday's casualties. Did not the suicide bombers who
killed 241 American servicemen and 100 French paratroops in Beirut on 23
October 1983, time their attacks with unthinkable precision?
<br><br>
There were just seven seconds between the Marine bombing and the destruction
of the French three miles away. Then there were the attacks on US bases in
Saudi Arabia, and last year's attempt almost successful it now turns out to
sink the USS Cole in Aden. And then how easy was our failure to recognise
the new weapon of the Middle East which neither Americans nor any other
Westerners could equal the despair-driven, desperate suicide bomber.
<br><br>
And there will be, inevitably, and quite immorally, an attempt to obscure
the historical wrongs and the injustices that lie behind yesterday's
firestorms. We will be told about "mindless terrorism", the "mindless" bit
being essential if we are not to realise how hated America has become in the
land of the birth of three great religions.
<br><br>
Ask an Arab how he responds to 20,000 or 30,000 innocent deaths and he or
she will respond as decent people should, that it is an unspeakable crime.
But they will ask why we did not use such words about the sanctions that
have destroyed the lives of perhaps half a million children in Iraq, why we
did not rage about the 17,500 civilians killed in Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. And those basic reasons why the Middle East caught fire last
September the Israeli occupation of Arab land, the dispossession of
Palestinians, the bombardments and state-sponsored executions ... all these
must be obscured lest they provide the smallest fractional reason for
yesterday's mass savagery.
<br><br>
No, Israel was not to blame though we can be sure that Saddam Hussein and
the other grotesque dictators will claim so but the malign influence of
history and our share in its burden must surely stand in the dark with the
suicide bombers. Our broken promises, perhaps even our destruction of the
Ottoman Empire, led inevitably to this tragedy. America has bankrolled
Israel's wars for so many years that it believed this would be cost-free. No
longer so. But, of course, the US will want to strike back against "world
terror", and last night's bombardment of Kabul may have been the opening
salvo. Indeed, who could ever point the finger at Americans now for using
that pejorative and sometimes racist word "terrorism"?
<br><br>
Eight years ago, I helped to make a television series that tried to explain
why so many Muslims had come to hate the West. Last night, I remembered some
of those Muslims in that film, their families burnt by American-made bombs
and weapons. They talked about how no one would help them but God. Theology
versus technology, the suicide bomber against the nuclear power. Now we have
learnt what this means.
