<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>reading some of the guests notes, i was grapped 
by the guest<br>"i am jewish", and his e. mail is anonymous.....<br>i like to 
say to that person, your point of view means nothing to us, palestinians, 
because every single fact you were tought is a big lie...<br>palestine has been 
and always will be an arab country, but the HEART of the arab, moslim, and 
chistian people, until the dooms day, for 5,000 years it's been an arab country, 
and jews has NO wright what soever in any inch of that land.<br>one more fact we 
have to mention, that : jewish is a relegion, just like any other,and not a 
nationality, and that relegion contain all nationality of the 
world,<br>therefore a nation that is cunstructed on that way of multi-ethnic 
will never last for too long.<br>so there is no way whatsoever, for us, and 
those people from all over the world to live in peace... they have<br>to go 
back, where ever they came from, poland, italy, russia<br>and other countries 
they have immegrated from. sooner or later they will leave, and palestine the 
holly land will clean herself back from the zionism dirt, that has been 
accmulating for 50 plus years.<br>jerusalim is the gate of heavens, it is the 
land of all the profits since adam alayhi alsalam, until sayeduna mohamad sala 
allaho alayhi wa salaam. we were honored by GOD, to protect that land, we are 
sooo proud to be palestinians, and<br>everybody knows how cheap our lives are 
for defending palestine, we wrote history in our blood, and we defending the 
honor of the moslim and the arab world. we thank GOD for that honor, and we 
promise not to drop the flag of our honor untill the last palestinian baby is 
gone......<br></p><hr>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>Assalam alaikom,firstly I would like to 
congratulate you for you work and effot to build this website.<br>But I have 
already read&nbsp; the section of Lebanon occupation by israel since 1978 until 
2000,and I am afraid it is not correct at all and I don't agree with the 
perspective is written:<br>1. It seems like you justify israeli agressions and 
occupation since 1978 until 2000 (not 1985) in Lebanon cause of palestine 
presence there,when we all know that israel doesn't need any excuse to practice 
his zionist project.<br>2. Second,Israel didn't design a "security zone"...was 
an occupied zone,please it is very important in order to inform correctly to 
those who read this article.<br>3. Israel is not the responsable only of Sabra 
and Chatila massacres,but many other very important massacres,like 
Beirut,Nabattiyeh,Abbasiyeh,Qana,etc massacres..with hundreds of lebanese 
civilians killed by israelis.<br>4.Militia of Lahad pro israeli,was not made to 
defend israelis from palestinian attacks,it was a forces which occupied and was 
a complicy in the occupation and massacres with israel, against lebanese 
people.<br>5. Israel,continued with occupation not because Siria didn't apply 
the accord between Lebanon and israel (lebanese president asked for syria 
presence in Lebanon in order to get a balance inside Lebanon),it's because 
Israel couldn't occupy more lebanese land and the unic land israel could keep 
occupied was south Lebanon.<br>6. Israeli occupation can't be justified by fear 
of a new civil war in Lebanon,otherwise,without israeli occupation there is more 
stability although the threaten is always there (by israel conspirations),this 
excuse is an israeli one please.<br>7. Also I don't like the way you speak about 
lebanese resistence against israeli occupation,like "shia guerrillas",in a 
ta2efeyye way.Resistence movements existed since 1978 when israeli occupation 
started,it's not because guerrillas of resistence took advantage in 1985 cause 
of any other hipothetic accord,it's because the actually and more important 
resistence in Lebanon (hizbollah) was founded in 1985.<br>Resistence doesn't 
need to took advantage of a critical politic situation to defend of israeli 
agressions.<br>8.Also,is like you justify that because most of resistence was 
shia lebaneses,in order to justify israel massacres against villages of south 
Lebanon (the 95% of south Lebanon is shia).So,naturally the victims were shia 
mostly.But it is not any excuse.<br>9. Israel most withdraw was not in june 
1985.What about the 1000 km square of lebanese land occupied by israelis during 
more than 22 years,liberated dailyu by resistent operations and blood??.Israel 
withdraw was in 25/5/2000 and also there are Shebaa farms and other zones 
occuied that must be free insha allah soon.But it's not correct and it will 
confuse people who is not aware about Lebanon occupation by israelis.The 
withdraw is not also due to any other accord or diplomacy works..it is because 
the fight and valenty of people sotuh Lebanon.Israel didn't make a 
withdraw..they ran away and there is a great difference between this 2 facts.And 
they wouldn't have ran away from Lebanon if they could occupy ALL Lebanon years 
before.<br><br>I hope you read this clarifycations without resentment,because I 
am sure the incorrections of the text are not voluntary..or might be you didn't 
write it,but anyway is necessary to write the real history,and not what zionist 
media is used to show us.<br><br>Best regards,wassalam<br></p><hr>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>Well, what could i say ???? i really was 
pleased to know about this site BUT when i first opened this site i was then 
really disappointed ! know why ? because the first flag that i saw was Terrorist 
Israel's flag !!!! i really wonder why we would have it's flag ... isn't it 
enough that this cancer like population&nbsp; is killing our people and now we 
are introducing it's flag in this site. At least we could have put it's flag in 
a very un pleasent way and not the right way because this cancer like people are 
really distorted and terrorists. This is what i feel and what i will always feel 
....<br>Viva forever Palestine <br>God bless all the palestinians who are 
sacrificing their souls for the freedom of palestine.<br>Long Live 
Palestine<br></p><hr>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>For many years i thougt that the palestinen 
people simply were bad terorist, killing inocent litle children from israel, and 
my sympathy was on stricly for the israelis, what we see in the mass medias is 
controlled by the jews and it messes up our minds so that we are not able to see 
the difrence between right and wrong,! for me personnel, the truth came from one 
of my arab friends today i know the truth, and my life have changed completly 
the world is in a critical situation, jews controls evrything, and they are 
reduceing rest of the world in to slavery, !!!!<br>we all,,, mankind must stand 
up against this/theese people and fight for the freedom,God have given us as a 
birth right my heart is vith the palestinen people, because they are fighting a 
fight,, that rest of the world sooner or later vill join !,but then it vill 
proberly be too late ! SO !!!!<br>FIGHT FOR FREEDOM NOW,,, JOIN THE PALESTINEN

<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>As a refugee living outside his homeland and 
whose rights are denied , i believe that if it hadn't been&nbsp; for the israeli 
occupation , i would have been now living in peace with my family in the land of 
peace. we all know that every palestinian has paid alot in the course of time , 
and we all have the belief that our homeland can't be retrieved without 
sacrifices and blood . we should all do something to make the distance to 
palestine shorter . however little is this thing that each of us can&nbsp; do , 
but we must have the faith that it is better than doing nothing. and we must 
keep in mind that what we do might seem to be just a drop of water in the ocean 
, however , without this little thing that we can do , the ocean would be 
missing that drop your brother jalal .<br></p><hr>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>I think that we as Palestinians should stop 
throwing rocks. If we do that, I am sure that we will have peace. That is what 
the jews want, I know but I think that if we do that then we will get the last 
say.<br></p><hr>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>I have been following this confict for quite 
some time now, and it makes me sick when people call palestinian struggle for 
freedom as "terrorism"? Is resistance to occupation (any form) evil or the 
occupation itself?. Will there be resistance to occupation if there is no 
occupation?. I am not muslim , but i have complete support and sympathy for the 
palestinians. They should not give up. Use non-voilent means of protest whenever 
possible. Use strategy and not emotions to fight the Israelis. <br>Liberty and 
Justise to Palestine!!!<br>Barry<br></p><hr>
