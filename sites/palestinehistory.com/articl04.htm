<p>By Palestine Information Center
<br><br>Is it a hobby for the Israeli soldiers and settlers to cripple innocent
Palestinian children by making them go blind? Do Israeli military
commanders make it a policy to serious maim, traumatize and if possible
kill off the young generation of Palestinians seeking the legitimate rights
of freedom, independence, and state? The Israeli occupation forces have
been targeting and firing at unarmed Palestinians and innocent children for
the past nineteen days.
<br><br>
The bull’s eye is the Palestinian eye. Hospital documentation and field
research has confirmed that the Israeli forces fire live ammunition and
rubber-coated metal bullets at close range with the sole intention to maim
or kill. This has been a daily practice for the Israeli occupation soldiers
in Palestine and there are hundreds of witnesses, numerous victims, and
critically wounded people to prove it. The Israeli occupation forces have
used disproportionate and fatal force to confront the Palestinians
demonstrators. In just 19 days, from September 29, to October 16, 2000, 95
people have been killed, 29 of them were children. According to information
collected by Defense For Children International-Palestine, as of October
14, 2000, at least 1,148 of the 4,044 injured are children. 132 of these
children were shot in the head, 20 shot in the eye, three of which have
lost their eyes completely.
<br><br>
What kind of threat did Ala Badran, 12, from occupied Jerusalem, constitute
for Israel? Ala was shot in the eye with a rubber-coated metal bullet,
which also broke his cheekbone and nose. Ala told LAW's field researcher,
"I was on my way to my uncle's house in Kalandia; the house is near
Jerusalem airport. As I left my uncle's car, near his home, an Israeli
soldier pointed his gun at me. he was only across the street. He fired at
me and his bullet hit my eye. My face and eye started bleeding. My mother
took me to Ramallah Hospital then to Saint John's Ophthalmic hospital in
Jerusalem; I lost my eye forever." Ala has lost his eye, and will need
further medical care. His father is too ill to work, his mother is
unemployed, and his uncles provide the sole support for the family.
<br><br>
Seven eyes have been removed form the faces of seven Palestinian children
at Saint John's Hospital. The hospital has treated a total of 22 eye injury
cases. Ziyad Farah, 20, from Bethlehem, was shot in the eye with a
rubber-coated metal bullet. The bullet entered the eye, and shattered the
bones around it. According to the hospital staff, eye injuries include
severe internal bleeding, damaged eye tissues, and damaged pupils.
<br><br>
On October 11, 2000, El Mizan Diagnostic Hospital in Hebron reported
treating 11 Palestinians for eye injuries, including 3 children. El Nasir
Ophthalmic Hospital, in Gaza has treated 16 people for eye injuries,
including 13 children. Nine of them lost one of their eyes.
<br><br>
Types of Bullets and injuries
<br><br>
Dr. Aghlab Khouri of Saint John’s Ophthalmic Hospital said in his affidavit
to LAW that "the cases that I treated during the clashes were cases of
direct shots to the eyes with rubber-coated steel bullets . These kinds of
bullets do not have a sharp ends and has a piece of metal inside; it hits
the eye with great speed, creating an explosion that shatters the eye and
the eye area." Dr. Khouri added "the eye is like a small ball that is
filled with a material that resembles jelly. When this ball is run over by
a car, it explodes. A rubber coated steel bullet does the same thing to the
eye. Therefore, in most cases, the wounded eye requires removal and it is
lost forever. However, if the wound does not lead to the removal of the
eye, it leads to shortsightedness or even blindness. Some of the cases had
a bullet lodged in the eye destroying the bones and the tissues which leads
to internal and nose bleeding."
<br><br>
From the hospital records and current case loads, it is obvious that the
Israeli soldiers, shoot at close range some from a distance of only 20
meters, and that they shoot to kill or seriously maim. Ala for example, was
shot from a distance of 20 meters. Hussein Othman, 37, from Sumoud camp was
shot from a distance of 3-5 meters only. As a result, he lost his eye
completely. Ziyad Fararja, 20, from Deheishea refugee camp lost his left
eye after being shot from a distance of 10 meters. Awad Mansour, 33, from
Al Azariyeh was shot from a distance of 20 meters and lost his left eye.
<br><br>
The PNA provides financial support to the victims
<br><br>
The Palestinian National Authority, in the name of its president Yassir
Arafat, is giving out US $300 to each of the wounded. Hussein Othman
however, refused such support though he disparately needs it. "I did not
sacrifice my eye for $300, I do not value my homeland for $300," he said.
<br><br>
Summary and International Legal Standards
<br><br>
Based on information like that above we have been able along the way, to
draw a preliminary assessment of the force used by the Israeli Forces
against Palestinians demonstrators, many of whom are children. Israel has
not only blatantly violated the articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention it
has violated several articles of the International Convention on the Rights
of the Child (CRC).
<br><br>
Article 37 of CRC states: "No child shall be subjected to torture or other
cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment." Article 6 of the CRC
states:
<br><br>
States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,
Sate Parties shall insure to the maximum extent possible the survival and
development of the child.
<br><br>
Article 38 of the CRC states: "States Parties undertake to respect and to
ensure respect for rules of international humanitarian law applicable to
them in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child."
<br><br>
Israel, with its disproportionate use of force has also violated the
international standards of force that have been set out in the 1979 Code of
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and 1990 Basic Principles on the Use
of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. These declare standards
that are inherent in human rights and international humanitarian law. The
1966 International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights requiring States
to protect the right to life and specifies that "No one shall be
arbitrarily deprived of his life". The 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention
prohibits States "from taking any measure of such a character as to cause
the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands
not only to murder but also to any other measures of brutality whether
applied by civilian or military agents."
<br><br>
Israel is a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention. Although Israel refuses
to apply these treaties, there is an overwhelming diplomatic and legal
consensus that these standards are de jure applicable. Nonetheless, Israel
claims that it applies the standards in these treaties.
<br><br>
Law enforcement officials (including Israel security forces in the occupied
Palestinian territory) are required in "performance of their duty [to]
respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights
of all persons." They may only use force "when strictly necessary and to
the extent required for the performance of their duty."
<br><br>
By the standards set out in the 1990 Basic Principles on the Use of Force
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, Israeli forces "shall not use
firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others
against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the
perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life
and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these
objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be
made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life."
<br><br>
"Whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law
enforcement officials shall:
<br><br>
(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness
of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved;
<br><br>
(b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life;
<br><br>
(c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or
affected persons at the earliest possible moment."
<br><br>
In the majority of cases, the use of force was not warranted by Israel.
There was no serious risk to life. In some cases, the killed and injured
were not involved in the violence. Where it was employed it was excessive,
extreme and lethal. Israeli forces often fired indiscriminately into crowds
of demonstrators without regard to human life and in a way that was
intended to maximize fatalities.
<br><br>
LAW urges the members of the proposed international investigation committee
to look at this information and make use of current findings collected by
Palestinian and International human rights organizations and medical
organizations. We urge the investigation committee to look at Israel’s
violation of international law and to draw its assessment from these facts.
<br><br>
We also urge the state parties to the International Convention on the
Rights of the Child to secure the rights of Palestinian children during
this time and force Israel to comply with its obligations under the
covenant .<br><br>----<br><br>Palestine Information Center Web Site<br>
