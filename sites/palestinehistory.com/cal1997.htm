for an Israeli redeployment from the West Bank city of Hebron. The plan
split Hebron into two security zones H1 and H2 . Palestinian police will
control area H1, while Israeli will remain in control of area H2, where
Jewish settlements, al-Haram al-Ebrahime, and many historic sites are
located.</p><br>

On February 26, Israeli government announced that they had approved plans
for a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, a predominantly Arab area.
The settlement, known in Hebrew as Har Homa, would eventually consist of
6500 apartments, as well as parks, schools, and shops. The building site is
known to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim . Palestinian leaders immediately
denounced the project.</p><br>

President Bill Clinton and other U.S. officials .
</p><a name="4mar97"></a><p>
On March 4 Israel ordered four Palestinian organizations to close their
offices in East Jerusalem. Israel says that the offices were parts of the
Palestinian Authority, which is not allowed to maintain offices outside
Gaza Strip and the parts under its direct control in the west bank .
</p><a name="7mar97"></a><p>
On March 7 the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to increase the West Bank
lands under Palestinian authority control by 9 percent. The offer has been
rejected by the Palestinian authority .
</p><a name="13mar97"></a><p>
On March 13 a Jordanian soldier opened fire on a group of Israeli school
children near the Israeli-Jordanian border, killing seven. An investigation
found that the soldier was emotionally disturbed . King Hussein traveled to
Israel to visits to the victim's families.
</p><a name="15mar97"></a><p>
On March 15 Arafat called for an emergency conference in the Gaza Strip .

project .

</p><a name="21mar97"></a><p>
On March 21, a bomb exploded in a sidewalk cafe in Tel Aviv , killing the
bomber and three other people. Dozens more were wounded. Hamas, a militant
Islamic group, took responsibility for the bombing. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of giving the
"green light" to renewed attacks in retaliation for Israeli approval of a
new Jewish settlement in largely Arab East Jerusalem.<br><br>
On March 7 and 21, the United States vetoed a United Nations (UN) Security
Council resolution that described the new settlement as "illegal." The
United States routinely vetoes Security Council resolutions it perceives as
biased against Israel.

staff Ehud Barak, 55, as the new party leader . Barak replaced Shimon
Peres, a Labor Party cofounder and one of the architects of the Middle East
peace process. If elected prime minister, Barak has said he would follow
Rabin's policies and move the peace process forward. He is also expected to
move the party away from its left-wing origins and toward the political
center.</p><br>

<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> August 1997 </b></font></center>
<p>On August 21 , retaliating for Israel's choke hold on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Authority began enforcing a partial boycott of
Israeli goods including cookies and toilet paper. Trucks carrying Israeli
products were turned away by Palestinian security forces who set up
roadblocks at the entrances to the autonomous Palestinian areas.</p><br>

<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> September 1997 </b></font></center>
<p>On September 4 , Three martyr bombers evidently acting in concert set off
bombs on a popular shopping promenade in Jerusalem on Thursday, killing
four passers-by and themselves. The three explosions followed in quick
succession at about 3:10 p.m. on Ben Yehuda Street, a shady pedestrian
thorough fare in West Jerusalem lined with boutiques and outdoor cafes, and
packed with Israelis and foreign tourists. Officials said eight people were
severely wounded, and about 180 others were also hurt.
</p><a name="9sep97"></a><p>
On September 9 , United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
arrived in Israel the first stop on a weeklong Middle East tour aimed at
generating new momentum for the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Albright visited Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria,
and Lebanon before leaving the region on September 15. Albright said her
efforts resulted in some progress. Palestinian authorities arrested some
Islamic militants. Israel said it would unfreeze tax revenues owed the PNA
and ease restrictions that prevent Palestinians from travelling between
Palestinian-controlled areas-measures that were imposed in response to the
recent martyr bombings.
</p><a name="19sep97"></a><p>
On September 19 , Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at stone-throwing
Arabs until Palestinian police intervened to stop the protests in the West
Bank town of Hebron on Friday. No one was hurt in the demonstration by
about 50 Palestinians against an Israeli government deal letting Jewish
seminary students stay in Arab East Jerusalem buildings in place of the
Jewish families who occupied them.</p><br>

<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> October 1997 </b></font></center>
<p>On October 1 , Sheik Ahmed Yassin the 61-year-old founder of the militant
Islamic group Hamas was released from Israeli prison , as part of a
prisoner swap touched off by a failed Israeli assassination attempt in
Amman, the capital of Jordan. The events that led Israel to free Yassin
unfolded on September 25 when Israeli agents reportedly attempted to poison
Khaled Meshal, a senior member of Hamas, in Amman. Jordan's King Hussein I
threatened to cut diplomatic relations unless the Israeli government
provided an antidote to the poison and agreed to free Yassin and several
dozen Palestinians and Jordanians held in Israeli prisons.
</p><a name="8oct97"></a><p>
On October 8 , The long-frozen peace process thawed somewhat as Netanyahu
and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat met for
the first time since February 1997. United States Middle East envoy Dennis
Ross, who helped organize the October 8 meeting, said that both sides had
agreed to resume negotiations.</p><br>

<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> December 1997 </b></font></center>
<p>On December 11, Palestinian census takers stand in the rain, knocking on
people's doors in traditionally-Arab east Jerusalem. But many residents
literally hide behind their closed doors, fearing a census which anywhere
else would be an exercise in basic civics. Even answering questions as
simple as "Do you have central heating?" can be risky. East Jerusalem's
Palestinians do not allow themselves to be photographed, for fear that
Israeli authorities will revoke their residency cards and evict them from
the city where their families have lived for centuries. The first-ever
Palestinian census turned into a tug-of-war over Jerusalem when Israel's
government pushed a bill through Parliament blocking Yasser Arafat's
census-takers from operating in the disputed city.</p><br>
