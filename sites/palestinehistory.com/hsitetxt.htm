<center>Dome of the Rock Mosque</center><br>
<p>For more than thirteen hundred years Al Aqsa has
been venerated throughout the Muslim world as the
third holiest site of Islam. It was to this that
the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon
him, made his Night Journey from the Masjid
al-Haram in Makkah. It was from this site that he,
peace and blessings be upon him, ascended on the
Mi'raj, his journey through the heavens to his
Lord.<br><br>
For thirteen hundred years Al-Aqsa has dominated
the skyline and the life of the Holy City. For
more than thirteen centuries it was a centre of
pilgrimage for Muslims from all over the world.
For the past twenty years, its very existence has
been threatened.<br><br>
In 638 Jerusalem's thousand years of recurrent
religious persecution, intolerance and oppression,
were brought to an abrupt halt: Omar ibn
al-Khattab, the Second Khalif of Islam, entered
al-Quds.<br><br>
Eager to be rid of their Byzantine overlords and
aware of their shared heritage with the Arabs, the
descendants of Ishmael, as well as the Muslims'
reputation for mercy and compassion in victory -
the people of Jerusalem handed over the city after
a brief siege.<br><br>
They made only one condition: That the terms of
their surrender be negotiated directly with the
Khalif Omar in person.<br><br>
Omar entered Jerusalem on foot . There was no
bloodshed. There were no massacres.<br><br>
Those who wanted to leave were allowed to, with
all their goods. Those who wanted to stay were
guarantee protection for their lives, their
property and places of worship.<br><br>
It is related that Omar asked Sophronius, the city
patriarch, to take him to the sanctuary of David,
as soon as he was through writing the terms of
surrender. They were joined by four thousand of
the Companions of the Prophet.</p><br>
<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> Al-Aqsa And The Dome Of The Rock </b></font></center><br>
<p>When they reached the area of the Noble Sanctuary
they found it covered in rubbish . Omar proceeded
to the west of the sanctuary and unfurled his
cloak. He filled it with debris. Those with him
did likewise. They disposed of it and returned,
again and again, until the whole area where
Al-Aqsa Mosque now stands was cleared.<br><br>
The entire area of the al-Haram al-Sharif, the
Noble Sanctuary, included more than 35 acres. The
great rock, site of the Prophet's ascension to
heaven on the Night Journey, peace and blessings
be upon him, and direction of the first qibla, lay
in the centre.<br><br>
The rock was uncovered and the ground purified. It
was suggested that the Muslims pray to the north
of the rock, to include it in the Qibla when
facing south toward Makkah. But Omar rejected this
idea, and possible future confusion, by praying to
the south of the rock, at the southernmost wall of
the Noble Sanctuary.<br><br>
A huge timber mosque which held three thousand
worshipers was erected on this site, the site of
the present Aqsa Mosque.<br><br>
Fifty years later, near the end of the 7th
century, it was given to the Umayyad Khalif, Abdul
Malik ibn Marwan, to construct one of the world's
most beautiful and enduring shrines over the rock
itself. Highlighting the skyline of Jerusalem, and
the memories of all that visit, the Dome of the
Rock is a tribute to the Muslims love and respect
for this site.<br><br>
After completion of the Dome of the Rock,
construction began on the site of the original
timber mosque at the south end of the Sanctuary. A
vast congregational mosque, accommodating over
5,000 worshipers, rose up. It became known as
Masjid al-Aqsa (al-Aqsa Mosque) , although, in
reality, the entire al-Haram al-Sharif is
considered Al-Aqsa Mosque, its entire precincts
inviolable.<br><br>
The next five centuries of Muslim rule were
characterized by peace, justice and prosperity.
The Noble Sanctuary became a great centre of
learning, scholars came from all over the world to
worship at Al-Aqsa and to study and teach within
its precincts.</p><br>

<p>This is the western wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque ,
Jewish and Israel assumed that this is all that is
left of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by the
Romans nearly 2,000 years ago.<br><br>
All the archaeological researches shows that this
wall are from the Islamic ages and have nothing to
do with the assumed Jewish Temple.<br><br>
There is a number of archaeological researches
published in Jews Media and University shows this
facts .</p><br>

<center><font size="+1" color="Blue"><b> Holy Sepulchre - Christian Site in Jerusalem </b></font></center><br>
<center><img src="image/holyspe1.jpg" width=310 height=230 border=0 alt="Holy Sepulchre"></center>
<p>The tomb in which Jesus was buried and the name of
the church built on the traditional site of his
Crucifixion and burial. According to the Bible,
the tomb was close to the place of Crucifixion ,
and so the church was planned to enclose the site
of both cross and tomb.<br><br>
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre lies in the
northwest quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.
Constantine the Great first built a church on the
site. It was dedicated about AD 336, burned by the
Persians in 614, restored by Modestus . In the
12th century the crusaders carried out a general
rebuilding of the church. Since that time,
frequent repair, restoration, and remodelling have
been necessary. The present church dates mainly
from 1810.<br><br>
This site has been continuously recognized since
the 4th century as the place where Jesus died, was
buried, and rose from the dead. Whether it is the
actual place, however, has been hotly debated. It
cannot be determined that Christians during the
first three centuries could or did preserve an
authentic tradition as to where these events
occurred. Members of the Christian Church in
Jerusalem fled to Pella about AD 66, and Jerusalem
was destroyed in AD 70. Wars, destruction, and
confusion during the following centuries possibly
prevented preservation of exact information.
Another question involves the course of the second
north wall of ancient Jerusalem. Some
archaeological remains on the east and south sides
of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre are widely
interpreted to mark the course of the second wall.
If so, the site of the church lay just outside the
city wall in the time of Jesus, and this could be
the actual place of his Crucifixion and burial. No
rival site is supported by any real evidence.<br><br>
Various Christian groups, including the Greek,
Roman, Armenian, and Coptic churches, control
parts of the present church and conduct services
regularly.</p><br>

<p>At Hebron, Abraham purchased the cave of
Mach-pelah as a burial place for his wife, Sarah,
from Ephron the Hittite , this became
a family sepulchre.<br><br>
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their wives Sarah,
Rebekah, and Leah, were buried in the cave.</p><br>

<center><img src="image/siteph01.jpg" width=325 height=225 border=0 alt="Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi"></center>
<p>The Cave of Mach-pelah is surmounted by a large
mosque, al-Haram al-Ibrahimi . After the Six-Day
War (1967), Israel partitioned the mosque by force
in to a Mosque and a Jewish service area, since
then Jewish services are held in the cave and
Muslim pray in the upper mosque which remains the
exclusive property of the Muslims.</p><br>

<center><img src="image/christ4.jpg" width=310 height=200 border=0 alt="Church of Nativity"></center>
<p>The site of the Nativity of Jesus was identified
by St. Justin Martyr, a 2nd century Christian
apologist, as a manger in "a cave close to the
village", the cave, now under the name of the
Church of the Nativity in the heart of the town,
has been continuously venerated by Christians
since then. St. Helena (c. 248-c. 328), mother of
the first Christian Roman emperor (Constantine I),
had a church built over the cave; later destroyed,
it was rebuilt in substantially its present form
by Emperor Justinian (reigned 527-565). The Church
of the Nativity is thus one of the oldest
Christian churches extant. Frequent conflicts have
arisen over the jurisdiction of various faiths at
the sacred site, often incited by outside
interests; thus, for example, the theft, in 1847,
of the silver star marking the exact traditional
locus of the Nativity was an ostensible factor in
the international crisis over the Holy Places that
ultimately led to the Crimean War (1854-56). The
church is now divided between the Greek Orthodox,
Roman Catholic, and Armenian Orthodox faiths.</p><br>
