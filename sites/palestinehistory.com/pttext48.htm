<p>In Oct.14 , The Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway,
announced that the peace prize was being awarded
to Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and to Yasser Arafat
,leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO). The award came one year after a peace
agreement was signed between Israel and the PLO
following decades of mutual hostility and
violence. There was some controversy among members
of the committee making the award: committee
member Kare Kristiansen resigned, saying Arafat's
violent past should have disqualified him from
receiving the award.</p>
