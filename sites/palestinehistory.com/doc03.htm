Paris, 29 April 1994<br><br>
Between the Government of the State of Israel and the PLO,
Representing the Palestinian people,<br><br>
This protocol lays the groundwork for strengthening the
economic base of the Palestinian side and for exercising its
right of economic decision making in accordance with its own
development plan and priorities. The two sides recognize each
other's economic lies with other markets and the need to create
a better economic environment for their peoples and
individuals'. 'The Palestinian Authority will levy VAT at one
rate on both locally produced goods and services and on imports
by the Palestinians ... and may fix it at the level of 15% or
16%.<br><br>
In addition to the points of exit and entry designated
according to the Article regarding Passages in Annex 1 of the
Agreement for the purpose of export and import of goods, the
Palestinian side has the right to use all points of exit and
entry in Israel designated for that purpose. The import and
export of the Palestinians through the points of exit and entry
in Israel will be given equal trade and economic treatment.<br><br>
The New Israeli Shequel (NIS) will be one of the circulating
currencies in the Areas (Occupied Territory) and will legally
serve there as means of payment for all purposes including
official transactions. Any circulating currency, including the
NIS will be accepted by the Palestinian Authority and by all
its institutions, local authorities and banks, when offered as
a means of payment for any transaction.<br><br>
Banks in the Areas will accept NIS deposits. The liquidity
requirements on the various kinds of NIS deposits (or deposit
linked to the NIS) in banks operating in the Areas will not be
less the 4% to 8%, according to the type of deposits. Changes
of over 1% in the liquidity requirements of NIS deposits (or
deposits linked to the NIS) in Israel will call for
corresponding changes in the above mentioned rates.<br><br>
Israel and the Palestinian Authority will each determine and
regulate independently its own tax policy in matters of direct
taxation, including income tax on individuals and corporations,
property taxes, municipal taxes and frees.<br><br>
Each tax administration will have the right to levy direct
taxes generated by economic activities within its area.<br><br>
Both side will attempts to maintain the normality of movement
of labour between them, subject to each side's right to
determine from time to time the extent and conditions of the
labour movement into its area. If the normal movement is
suspended temporarily by either side, it will give the other
side immediate notification, and the other side may request
that the matter be discussed in the Joint Economic Committee.<br><br>
The placement and employment of workers from one side in the
area of the other side will be through the employment service
of the other side and in accordance with the other side's
legislation. The Palestinian side has the right to regulate the
employment of Palestinian labour in Israel through the
Palestinian employment service, and Israeli employment service
will cooperate and coordinate in this regard.
