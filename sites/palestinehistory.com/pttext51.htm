<p>In April 9, Two militant Muslim groups launched a
pair of martyr car bombings against Israelis in
the Gaza Strip, killing eight people and wounding
more than 45. In the first attack, which took
place near Kfar Darom, an Israeli settlement about
10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of Gaza City, a
van loaded with explosives was detonated next to a
passenger bus, killing seven soldiers and one
American tourist,and wounding more than 40 others,
Two hours later, several people were injured when
a martyr bomber drove a car-bomb into an Israeli
convoy on the road to the settlement of Netzarium,
about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away from the site
of the first attack. The Islamic militant groups
Hamas and Jihad (Holy War) claimed responsibility
for the bombings . Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin denounced the attacks and warned that unless
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) worked
to crush the militant groups operating in its
territory, Israel would oppose expanding
Palestinian self-rule.</p>
