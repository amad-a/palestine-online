<p>In Palestine, Arab protests against
partition erupted in violence, with
attacks on Jewish settlements in
retaliation to the attacks of Jews
terrorist groups to Arab Towns and
villages & massacres in hundred against
unarmed Palestinian in there homes,
that soon led to a full-scale war. The
British generally refused to intervene,
intent on leaving the country no later
than August 15, 1948, the date in the
partition plan for termination of the
mandate.<br><br>
When it became clear that the British
intended to leave by May 15, leaders of
the Yishuv decided ( as they claim ) to
implement that part of the partition
plan calling for establishment of a
Jewish state.<br><br>
In Tel Aviv on May 14 the Provisional State
Council, formerly the National Council,
“representing the Jewish people in Palestine and
the World Zionist Movement,” proclaimed the
“establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine,
to be called Medinat Israel (the State of Israel)
… open to the immigration of Jews from all the
countries of their dispersion.”<br><br>
On May 15 the armies of Egypt, Transjordan (now
Jordan), Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq joined
Palestinian and other Arab guerrillas who had been
fighting Jewish forces since November 1947. The
war now became an international conflict , the
first Arab-Israeli War . The Arabs failed to
prevent establishment of a Jewish state, and the
war ended with four UN-arranged armistice
agreements between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon,
Jordan, and Syria. The frontiers defined in the
armistice agreements remained until they were
altered by Israel's conquests during the Six Days
War in 1967.</p>
