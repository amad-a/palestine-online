04.01.99 , Israeli officials say two Israeli women
were shot and wounded this morning in the West
Bank town of Hebron by Palestinian gunmen.<br><br>
05.01.99 , The Israeli parliament yesterday
granted final approval to plans for early general
elections to be held May 17.<br><br>
06.01.99 , Former Israeli army chief Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak this morning declared his candidacy
for the office of prime minister in the nation's
upcoming general elections.<br><br>
A Palestinian carrying what turned out to be a toy
pistol near a Jewish enclave in Hebron was shot
Wednesday by Israel soldiers and died several
hours later, the army said. Hebron, home to
130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers, is
one of the tensest spots in the West Bank. The new
violence in Hebron comes at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is on hold.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
accused the Palestinians of violating the Wye
River peace agreement and has said he would not
hand over more West Bank land, as required by the
accord, until the Palestinians meet their
obligations.<br><br>
11.01.99 , Israeli military officials say they
intend to end a week-old curfew in the
Palestinian controlled part of the city of Hebron.<br><br>
12.01.99 , A Palestinian was seriously wounded in
a knife attack in Jerusalem Tuesday, an assault
police said may be linked to eight other stabbings
blamed on a Jewish extremist. The 50-year-old
victim was found during morning rush hour in the
ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Mea Shearim.
He was taken into surgery at Hadassah Hospital,
said police spokeswoman Sigal Toledo. Toledo said
a bloody knife was found in the area at about 6
a.m., but despite a search of the area, the victim
was not found until a passer-by came upon him 90
minutes later. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Jerusalem Police Chief Yair Yitzhaki said the
attack may be linked to the stabbings of eight
other Palestinians in Mea Shearim since November
1997.<br><br>
14.01.99 , Israeli army officials say an Israeli
border guard was killed and a Palestinian
seriously wounded yesterday in attacks near the
West Bank town of Hebron.<br><br>
25.01.99 , Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai will reportedly leave his position today
after being fired for planning a move to an
opposition political party. Reports from Israel
say three other former officials of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party will join
Mordechai in forming a new centrist opposition
party: former army chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
former finance minister Dan Meridor and former Tel
Aviv Mayor Roni Milo.<br><br>
26.01.99 , Israel razed an Arab-owned home in
Jerusalem Tuesday, and helmeted troops protecting
the demolition equipment fired rubber bullets at
Palestinian protesters who hurled stones toward
the house. Four Palestinians were injured by
rubber bullets, including one who was in serious
condition. A fifth was treated for bruises after
being clubbed by Israeli troops. One of the
injured, Zaki Obeid, fell to the ground bleeding
profusely after being struck in the face by a
rubber bullet. He lay motionless for a few moments
before being carried away to the cries of "Allah u
Akbar!" or "God is great."<br><br>
27.01.99 , One day after winning his party's
nomination for prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu
has put together a team he hopes will help him win
re-election. It wasn't easy. As he watched his
opponents gain supporters, Netanyahu mostly
counted deserters. His former defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, has joined forces to lead a new
centrist party with a charismatic general, a
popular former Tel Aviv mayor and a finance
minister who quit Netanyahu's government. Under
the slogan "One Nation," Ehud Barak, the leader of
the opposition Labor party, is gaining support
from smaller parties. At a news conference,
Netanyahu introduced his partners, right-wing
Likud veteran Moshe Arens, who was to replace
Mordechai as defense minister, and hawkish Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.<br><br>
28.01.99 , A Palestinian man died Thursday from
wounds suffered when Israeli troops shot him in
the head with a rubber-coated steel bullet, a
hospital spokeswoman said. Zaki Obeid was
critically injured Tuesday during a clash between
Israeli riot police and Palestinians protesting
the demolition of an Arab home in east Jerusalem.
Obeid died Thursday afternoon from the bullet that
lodged in the rear of his brain, Hadassa hospital
spokeswoman Yael Bosom said.<br><br>

Arafat is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow
with U.S. Secretary of State and President Bill
Clinton in Washington.<br><br>
08.02.99 , King Hussein's funeral brought together
sworn enemies Monday, including a PLO guerrilla
leader who approached Israel's president, praised
him as a man of peace, and shook his hand. The
scene involving Nayef Hawatmeh and Ezer Weizman
was witnessed by Weizman's adviser, Arieh Shumer,
who said it was a random encounter. Weizman took
Hawatmeh's outstretched hand and told him the time
had come to make peace with Syria and Lebanon.<br><br>
10.02.99 , Israel rejected a U.N. General Assembly
call for an international conference on Israeli
settlement expansion in the West Bank, charging
Wednesday that it violates peace accords with the
Palestinians. By a vote of 115-2 with five
abstentions, the General Assembly Tuesday called
for a conference of the signatories of the 1949
Geneva Conventions to consider measures to stop
Israeli settlement activity.<br><br>
12.02.99 , In a surprise move, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Friday revived an idea for forging a
confederation between Jordan and a future
Palestinian state. Arafat's proposal won a cool
reception in Jordan, where an official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said any decision on a
confederation must wait until the West Bank and
Gaza Strip are under full Palestinian control.<br><br>

air Thursday in Gaza to disperse stone-throwing

05.04.99 , Israeli police served closure orders
against three Palestinian offices in Jerusalem
yesterday, saying that, under interim peace
agreements, the Palestinian Authority has no right
to conduct operations in the city. Palestinian
officials characterized the move as a pre-election
"stunt" by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.<br><br>
08.04.99 , Japan's prime minister urged Yasser
Arafat not to declare Palestinian statehood before
restarting talks with Israel, a government
official said. Japan has been pushing Arafat not

such a declaration May 4.<br><br>
13.04.99 , The Palestinian leadership will decide
April 27 whether to declare a state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip a week later or heed the

Palestinian statehood in exchange for a delay in

23.04.99 , Israel's decision to close Palestinian
headquarters in Jerusalem smacks of electioneering
and could provoke a violent response . Israeli
security chiefs met to consider deploying more
police in the contested city. The Palestinian
compound, known as the Orient House, is a small,
century-old hotel that was already serving as
Palestinian political headquarters before Israel
and the Palestinians started signing peace
agreements in 1993. The government moved to shut
down the Orient House Thursday, after Faisal
Husseini, the top Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, invited European consuls to the
offices.<br><br>

Central Council leaders agreed to postpone a

ordered three offices in the PLO's Jerusalem
headquarters closed , setting up a showdown with
the Palestinians just a week before Israeli
elections. Palestinian leaders and Israeli
security officials warned that police action
against the headquarters, known as the Orient
House, could trigger Palestinian riots.<br><br>
11.05.99 , Israel say that nation's High Court has
ordered the government to delay the closing of the

hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud
Barak promised Tuesday to forge a secure peace
with the Palestinians, pull troops out of Lebanon
in a year and heal the deep divisions among
Israelis. After three years at Israel's helm, a
tearful Netanyahu gracefully conceded defeat and
said he would step down as leader of his Likud
party. In an emotional speech, Barak, Israel's
most decorated soldier, promised tens of thousands
of supporters that he would continue the path of
peace forged by former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin. He spoke in Rabin Square - the plaza in Tel
Aviv where Rabin was gunned down in 1995.<br><br>
20.05.99 , Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak
said yesterday that he intends to head the
nation's defense ministry himself. Barak said the
move is intended to allow himself greater control
over both political and security facets of future
Israeli-Palestinian peace initiatives.<br><br>
27.05.99 , In the first violent confrontation
since the Israeli election, club-wielding Israeli
police charged into a crowd of Palestinian
protesters to keep them away from a Jewish
neighborhood under construction in disputed east
Jerusalem. Police, some on horseback, pushed and
shoved protesters and beat a bodyguard for Faisal
Husseini, the top PLO official in Jerusalem.

Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were
injured in protest-related clashes in the West
Bank and Gaza.<br><br>
14.06.99 , Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the government to bring
thousands of Jews left behind in Ethiopia to
Israel quickly. Some 2,500-3,500 Jews in the Quara
region of Ethiopia were left behind when some
21,500 others came to Israel years ago, and have
been trying to reach the Jewish state ever since.<br><br>

July<br><br>

14.07.1999, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
suggested that the U.S. should scale back its role

push the peace process forward.<br><br>

timetable for turning over control of the West
Bank to Palestinians.<br><br>
09.08.1999, At least six Israeli soldiers were

peace deal following six hours of negotiations .<br><br>

09.09.1999 , Israel began the process of freeing
Palestinian prisoners this morning as part of the
recently renewed Mid-East peace process. 199
prisoners were released today.<br><br>
10.09.1999, Israel transferred administrative

October<br><br>
05.10.1999 , Israel and the Palestinians agreed
Tuesday to establish the first open land link
between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - seen by
Palestinians as a vital step toward eventual
statehood. Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat approved the
deal, which would allow Palestinians for the first
time to move relatively freely between the areas,
traveling on a fixed set of highways across the
breadth of Israel. The so-called "safe passage"
route will provide Arafat with one of the key
underpinnings of the state he has long sought, and
is the most significant achievement of the newly
revived peace process.<br><br>
11.10.1999 , The Israeli cabinet gave Prime
Minister Ehud Barak the power yesterday to close
unauthorized Jewish outposts in the West Bank . In
the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak

not be allowed to remain in the territory.<br><br>
15.10.1999 , Israel freed 151 Arab security
prisoners Friday, moving its peace agreement with
the Palestinians back on track after minor delays.
Cheering relatives greeted convoys of buses at
drop-off points in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Prisoners leaned out of windows, flashing victory
signs, their hands still tied with plastic cuffs.
"Mother, he's out," a teen-age boy shouted into a
cellular phone when he saw his brother on one of
the buses. Prisoner releases are an emotional
issue . Palestinians consider the inmates heroes
in the struggle for independence.<br><br>
25.10.1999 , Israel opened a 27-mile safe passage
route along existing roads this morning that
connects the Palestinian areas of West Bank and
Gaza.<br><br>
26.10.1999 , Israel tore down the home of three
Palestinian families in east Jerusalem on Monday
despite a promise to slow the pace of such
demolitions. Israel's police minister, Shlomo
Ben-Ami, opposes demolishing Palestinian homes
built without permits and has been re-examining
the practice. Since moderate Prime Minister Ehud
Barak took office July 6, only four homes have
been razed. The owner of the house destroyed
Monday, Fouwad Khader, said he had been warned by
police that his home would be demolished and
obtained a court order in an effort to block the
action.<br><br>
November<br><br>
01.11.1999 , President Clinton said Monday he
hopes to inject "renewed energy" into the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and encouraged
both sides to move quickly toward agreement on a
final treaty within 10 months. "This is the hard
part, the really hard part, and we all need to
support them," Clinton told reporters during a
question-and-answer session with Norwegian Prime
Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.<br><br>
04.11.1999 , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton ended two days of peace
talks in Oslo, Norway.<br><br>
08.11.1999 , Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
began negotiations on a final peace treaty today
in the West Bank town of Ramallah. - two hours of
talks were held this morning despite a bomb attack
that wounded at least 30 people in the Israeli
coastal town of Netanya yesterday.<br><br>
10.11.1999 , Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Cabinet
Wednesday approved a troop withdrawal from 5% of
the West Bank, hours after Israeli troops dragged
hundreds of Jewish settlers, some kicking and
others hurling red paint, out of a key encampment.
The confrontation at Havat Maon was one of the
most dramatic between settlers and the government
since 1982, when Israel leveled the Yamit
settlement in the Sinai Peninsula as part of its
peace treaty with Egypt. The eviction was followed
by the Cabinet's 17-1 vote to approve next week's
Israeli troop withdrawal.<br><br>
15.11.1999 , Reports say Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have failed to finalize a plan for the
turnover of an additional 5% of the West Bank to
Palestinian control. - the exchange was to have
been made this morning.<br><br>
15.11.1999 , The 11th Palestinian independence day
had all the right ingredients - cheering crowds,
boy scouts and military parades. But for many
Palestinians, Monday's celebration was a painful
reminder of what they are missing - a state of
their own. The mood was also dampened by the delay
of an Israeli troop pull back from 5% of the West
Bank, originally scheduled for Monday. The two
sides disagreed over the pull back, with the
Palestinians saying the areas Israel offered to
hand over were too sparsely populated and failed
to connect the isolated enclaves already under
Palestinian control.<br><br>
17.11.1999 , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
U.S. President Bill Clinton are expected to
discuss the stalled hand over of West Bank
territory to Palestinian control when they meet
today in Istanbul, Turkey.<br><br>
23.11.1999 , Reports say about 15 Jewish settlers
occupied a new site in the West Bank this morning
in protest against Israeli policies that are
removing such settlements. - the settlement is
near the Palestinian-controlled town of Bethlehem.<br><br>
December<br><br>
01.12.1999 , Israel's proposals for surrendering
West Bank land to Palestinian control topped the
agenda of Wednesday's talks between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. Speaking to reporters before
leaving Cairo to return to Gaza, Arafat said
discussions focused on the current
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and Palestinian
objections to the maps of a proposed Israeli troop
withdrawal from 5% of the West Bank and Jewish
settlements in the territory. The withdrawal was
scheduled to take place Nov. 15 under the
Israeli-Palestinian accord signed in September
after U.S. mediation. But the Palestinians
rejected Israel's proposed redeployments, saying
they vacated areas that were too thinly populated
and not contiguous.<br><br>
02.12.1999 , Palestinian lawmaker Mouawiyah
al-Masri, who was wounded by a gunman yesterday,
suggested today that he was shot because he signed
a leaflet accusing Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat of encouraging corruption.<br><br>
15.12.1999 , Peace talks between Israel and Syria
resume today in Washington, DC, following a
four-year break. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara will
meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton this
morning.<br><br>
29.12.1999 , After several weeks of delay, Israel
Wednesday released 26 Palestinian security
prisoners as part of the latest interim peace
accord with the Palestinians. Buses carrying the
26 inmates left two prisons in the southern Negev
Desert and the coastal city of Ashkelon Wednesday
afternoon. The releases had been held up for
several hours by a Supreme Court appeal filed by
relatives of Israelis killed in attacks. In the
end, the justices refused to stop the releases.
The release is the third and final one under an
interim peace accord signed in September. In the
two earlier releases, 350 Palestinians convicted
of anti-Israel offenses were set free. The
Palestinians complained that many of those freed
Wednesday have only a few months left to serve.
They had demanded that a much larger number of
prisoners be released, including those sentenced
to long terms .</p>
