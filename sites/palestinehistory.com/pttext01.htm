<p>In 1896 following the
appearance of anti-Semitism in
Europe, Theodore Herzl, the
founder of Zionism tried to
find a political solution for
the problem in his book, 'The
Jewish State'. He advocated
the creation of a Jewish state
in Argentina or Palestine.<br><br>
In 1897 the first Zionist Congress was held in
Switzerland, which issued the Basle programme on
the colonization of Palestine and the
establishment of the World Zionist Organization
(WZO).<br><br>
In 1904 the Fourth Zionist Congress decided to
establish a national home for Jews in Argentina.<br><br>
In 1906 the Zionist congress decided the Jewish
homeland should be Palestine.<br><br>
In 1914 With the outbreak of World War I, Britain
promised the independence of Arab lands under
Ottoman rule, including Palestine, in return for
Arab support against Turkey which had entered the
war on the side of Germany.</p>
