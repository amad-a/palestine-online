<div align="center"><font size="+3" color="Blue"> The 1948 Nakba: Facts and Lessons </font></div>
<p>By Ibrahim Ghosheh (Hamas Spokesman)<br><br>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<br><br>The 1948 Nakba, or catastrophe, included very important and dangerous
developments that affected most categories of Palestinian People and some
Arab people, especially those who participated in the war against Jewish
settlement activity. Therefore, it was strange that the 1950s witnessed a
feverish rush of individuals to affiliate with political and Islamic
movements and parties, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the Baath party
and the Communist party, and the Arab national movements. The younger
Arab generation believed that they could treat the deep wounds of the
Nakba and they could get rid of the colonization by gathering the Arabs
round a unified idea. These desires and ambitions were embodied by the
successful and unsuccessful coups and revolutions that prevailed in the
1950s. The Palestinian Nakba was the main reason that stood behind them.
Later, the new regimes and revolutions became more involved in their
local questions and forgot about Palestine and its Nakba.
<br><br>
<b>DIFFERENT SITUATIONS ON THE EVE OF NAKBA</b>
<br><br>
<b>1. The Palestinian People</b>
<br><br>
The struggle against the Jewish settlers increased after the 1947 United
Nations resolution regarding the Partition of Palestine No. 181. The
struggle reached a peak in mid-May 1948 when the United Kingdom ended its
mandate in Palestine. But the Palestinian struggle against the Jews had
begun in 1917 following the Balfour Declaration.
<br><br>
The main objective of the British mandate in Palestine, which continued
for about 30 years, was to ensure the Jewish immigration from Europe,
Russia and the Arab States and to offer them more Palestinian land. The
Palestinian land that was owned by the Jews on the eve of the Nakba did
not exceed 5.5% of Palestine. Other objectives were to provide military
training to the Zionist terrorist groups, namely the Haganah, Irgun and
Stern, and to oppress Palestinians and suppress their revolutions.
Without the British, the Jews would not have been able to declare their
State on 14 May 1948. The British mandate also chased away the
Palestinian political leadership, represented by Haj Amin Al Husseini,
which left the Palestinian People without a powerful leadership. The
Jews, on the contrary, were united round Ben Gurion, and all the Zionist
terrorist groups were also united.
<br><br>
<b>2-Arab Situation</b>
<br><br>
The situation of the Arab people and their governments were
deteriorating. Their governments were formally independent, but in
reality, they were subjected to the British and French colonization.
Egypt was ruled by King Farouq, who was subject to Britain. The Jordanian
army was led by a British officer, who was also assisted by the
influential British officers. Syria and Lebanon were newly independent
from the French colonization, and their armies were very weak. In Iraq,
the pro-Britain Nouri Saed was ruling the country.
<br><br>
<b>3-Jewish situation</b>
<br><br>
The Jews, assisted by the British, built a military power. A number of
Israeli leaders, named President Ezra Weisman and the former President
Haim Hertzog, had served in the British army during the Second World War.
The British made it easy for the Jews to smuggle weapons and build secret
military factories. They also handed over their camps to the Jewish
settlers before leaving Palestine. More than 70,000 Jews were carrying
weapons against only 20,000 Arabs, including Arab soldiers, Palestinian
resistants and the Muslim Brotherhood Mujahideen. Ordered by the Soviet
Union, Czechoslovakia supplied the Jewish settlers with weapons while
most of their funding came from the United States.
<br><br>
<b>Arab-Israeli War</b>
<br><br>
After 5 May 1948, several Arab armies entered Palestine, most notably the
Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi armies. Before that date,
Palestinians had fought the Jewish settlers alone since 29 November 1947.
The Jewish settlers conquered a number of Palestinian cities, namely
Haifa, Jaffa, Safad and Acre, as well as a large number of Palestinian
villages. The Arab armies were distributed over the different fronts,
but, unfortunately, there was no coordination or cooperation among them.
They did not back up each other. This tragedy was repeated in the June
1967 war. Although the armies fought bravely, they failed to keep their
control on their fronts and were forced to retreat. The Arab armies
committed a mistake by accepting the first Hudna (truce) in mid-1948
because the truce enabled the Zionists to bolster their forces with more
soldiers and more weapons, including air fighters. They succeeded to
break up the siege that was imposed by the Jordanian army and the Muslim
Brotherhood Mujahideen on Western Jerusalem, which was about to surrender
with 100,000 Jews inside.
<br><br>
<b>Facts and Lessons</b>
<br><br>
The Nakba affected every Palestinian family, the majority of which became
homeless and of refugee status. Their villages and houses were removed,
and the Zionists controlled 78% of Palestine. There are many lessons to
be absorbed from Nakba, some of which are outlined below:
<br><br>
<b>1.</b> While the Jewish settlers fought in Palestine with high religious and
national morale, the Arab morale was much less. Only a few of the Arabs
were fighting out of their Islamic faith or patriotism. There were many
fighters of freedom in Palestine over the past 40 years. At the end of
this period, the Islamist fighters seeking martyrdom (Mujahidoun) finally
appeared, and they are mentioned in Surah Al-Isra'a in the Holy Qur'an.
<br><br>
<b>2.</b> The Arab governments disarmed Palestinians when their armies entered
Palestine in May 1948. Palestinians, who knew their land better than the
Arab armies and who were more enthusiastic in defending their land, were
in need of military training and weapons. Martyr Hassan Al Banna, the
leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, requested permission from the Arab
League to send 12,000 Muslim Brotherhood fighters to join their brothers
in Palestine, but his request was rejected. One year later, Hassan Al
Banna was assassinated, and his followers were imprisoned.
<br><br>
<b>3.</b> The Jewish settlers committed several massacres against Palestinian
civilians such as that in Deir Yassin, Dawaymeh, Lud and other places.
The news of the massacres spread throughout Palestine, which horrified
Palestinians in other areas and forced them to leave their homes. This is
exactly what the Zionist leaders such as Ben Gurion, Shamir, Begin and
others wanted.
<br><br>
<b>4.</b> There was not a united Arab leadership to confront the united Jewish
leadership. Every Arab army led the war alone. There was clear
competition and distrust among the Arab leaders.
<br><br>
<b>5.</b> Arab acceptance of the first truce in mid-1948 gave the Jews an
opportunity to import weapons and to bring the air fighters and more
troops.
<br><br>
<b>6.</b> The Palestinian People, on the eve of UN resolution 181 (the Partition
resolution) of 29 November 1947, needed political leadership to lead
their fighting and struggle. The only prominent Palestinian leader at the
time was Haj Amin Husseini who was abroad. If Haj Amin dared to enter
Palestine at that time to be among his people, the Palestinian situation
would have been better.
<br><br>
<b>7.</b> A number of Arab governments, namely Morocco, Yemen, Iraq and Egypt,
allowed their Jews to immigrate to Palestine where they became soldiers
and terrorists fighting the Palestinians.</p><br>
