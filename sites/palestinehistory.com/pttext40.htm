<p>The stunning
performances of the
young Soviet gymnast
Olga Korbut and the
gold medals of
American swimmer
Mark Spitz and
British athlete Mary
Peters could not
dispel the horror in
Munich when the 20th Olympic Games became the setting for an
guerrilla attacked which left 11 Israeli athletes
dead.<br><br>
The attacked began just before dawn on September
5th when eight hooded guerrillas scaled the fence
around the Olympic Village. Bursting into the
dormitory where the 11 Israeli athletes were
sleeping, they shot two dead and took the other
nine hostage, threatening to kill them unless 200
Arab guerrillas were released. The German
authorities agreed to take the guerrillas to
Furstentbldbruck military airfield where a
Lufthansa airliner was waiting on the tarmac to
fly them out of the country. There they were
ambushed by German marksmen, but in the ensuing
gun battle all nine hostages were killed in the
cross-fire.</p>
