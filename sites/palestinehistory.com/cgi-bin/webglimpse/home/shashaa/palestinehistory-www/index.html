<H2>What is Glimpse ?</H2>
<QUOTE>
<P>
Glimpse (which stands  for  GLobal  IMPicit  SEarch)  is  an
indexing  and query system that allows you to search through
all your files very quickly.   For  example,  a  search  for
Schwarzkopf  allowing  two  misspelling errors in 5600 files
occupying 77MB took 7 seconds on a SUN  IPC.   Glimpse  supports
most of agrep's options (agrep is our powerful version
of  grep)  including  approximate  matching  (e.g.,  finding
misspelled  words),  Boolean  queries, and even some limited
forms of regular expressions.<BR>
Glimpse's running time is typically slower than systems
tems using inverted indexes, but its index is  an  order  of
magnitude smaller (typically 2-5% of the size of the files).
