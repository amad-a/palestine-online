Events in the Middle
East took a surprising
turn in 1993. After
secret negotiations,
Prime Minister Rabin and
PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat flew to
Washington, D.C., and
agreed to the signing of
an historic peace
agreement.
<br><br>
Israel agreed to allow for Palestinian self-rule,
first in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of
Jericho, and later in other areas of the West Bank
that are not settled by Jews .
<br><br>
In Sept,93 , At a ceremony in Washington, D.C.,
representatives of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) signed an agreement
designed to end 45 years of confrontation between
the Israelis and Palestinians. The actual signing
was done by Israel's foreign minister, Shimon
Peres, and PLO foreign policy spokesman, Mahmoud
Abbas. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and
PLO leader Yasser Arafat met and shook hand on the
White House lawn, as President Bill Clinton of the
United States and 3,000 guests looked on. The
agreement was limited in scope; it provided for
transfer of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to
Palestinian rule within a few months. But the
accord was regarded as a first step in resolving
years of violent conflict between Jews and
Palestinians. The agreement had been worked out
secretly in Oslo, Norway, with the mediation of
Norway's foreign minister, Johan Jorgen Holst.
Following the signing, a long process of
negotiation began on the means of transferring
power in the occupied lands.</p>
