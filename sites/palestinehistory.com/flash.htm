<p>This Flash show has been widely distributed though the Internet to show (as
they claim) the difference between the Dome of the Rock (Qubbet es-Sakhrah)
and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. In this Flash there is number of historical and
geographical errors which give major concern about the real purpose of this
program. These mistakes will give totally different images about the truth,
and may in some other ways, prove the FALSITY of Israeli and Jewish claims
to Al-Qouds and the Western Wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque.<br><br>
Here are some examples of the mistakes I found in this Flash show: -<br><br>
1. The orientation of the image is not correct. Where the Al-Aqsa Mosque
building is, in reality, on the Western side, it is, instead shown to be on
the Southern side in this image. This is very important since we have to use
these directions to show the place of the Jewish claimed Western Wall.<br><br>
2. There is also a discrepancy with the Western Wall or Al-Bouraq wall (Jews
claim it as the Wailing Wall and the only remnant of Solomon's Temple). The
location of this important wall in this flash image is shown to be behind
the Al-Aqsa Mosque building ( or, to the South of Al-Aqsa mosque haram),
while in reality, it should be to the West side (or, in this image the left
side )of Al-Aqsa Mosque walls and, therefore, BEHIND the Dome of the Rock on
the same side of "Huta Gate". The location on the map are remments of an
Islamic Khalifa's Palace behind the Al-Aqsa Mosque.<br><br>
3. The Jewish sector of the city is not correct. After the 1967 war, Jewish
forces took control of "Harat Al-Magarba" which contains the Western Wall.
This area is not included in the Jewish section and is unedited.<br><br>
4. It also makes reference that the Jewish sector is cleaner and more modern
than the Arab sector. (?)<br><br>
5. The Holy Sepulcher is also in the wrong position since that place
identified in the program as the Holy Sepulcher is just a small part of the
Christian sector of Jerusalem. The Holy Sepulcher, in reality, is in the
center of this area.<br><br>
6. They said that the Al-Aqsa Mosque was built by Adam and later completed
by Prophets Solomon and David (Suleimon and Dahood). Never has it been
stated in any reference material that Solomon or David had anything to do
with Al-Aqsa Mosque. They had built a temple somewhere in Al-Qouds but it is
not at all this building. It is well known that Khalifa Omar was the one who
rebuilt the Mosque (after opening the City of Jerusalem in the year 638).<br><br>
7. The program said that Prophet Mosa entered Al-Aqsa Mosque from Huta Gate.
This is totally not true since Prophet Mosa passed away on the way to
Palestine before reaching Jericho. He was buried on the way to Jericho in a
remote desert place, never having made it to Jericho and never having
entered Al-Qouds. This is an historical fact also accepted by Jewish
believers.<br><br>
8. As for the Arab sector, this flash program states that it has been left
to Arabs to live in it. Arab Muslims and Christians, both, were living in
Al-Qouds for over thousands of years.<br><br>
All are requested to clarify such facts to their friends and please stop
forwarding such programs to others since it will demolish what we are trying
to build.<br><br>
If someone can correctly edit the above Flash program, it will definitely be
considered excellent work.<br><br>
