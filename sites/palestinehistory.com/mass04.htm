<p>On the night of October 14-15, 1953, this village was the object of an
Israeli attack which was carried out by units from the regular army and in
which a variety of weapon types were used. On the evening of October 14, an
Israeli military force estimated at about 600 soldiers moved toward the
village. Upon arrival, it surrounded it and cordoned it off from all of the
other Arab villages. The attack began with concentrated, indiscriminate
artillery fire on the homes in the village. This continued until the main
force reached the outskirts of the village. Meanwhile, other forces headed
for nearby Arab towns such as Shuqba, Badrus and Na'lin in order to
distract them and prevent any aid from reaching the people in Qibya. They
also planted mines on various roads so as to isolate the village
completely. As units of the Israeli army were attacking the village
residents, units of military engineers were placing explosives around some
of the houses in the village and blowing them up with everyone in them.
This attack continued until 4:00 A.M., October 15, 1953, at which time the
Israeli forces withdrew to the bases from which they had begun.<br><br>
This terrorist attack resulted in the destruction of 56 houses, the village
mosque, the village school and the water tank . Moreover, 67 citizens lost
their lives, both men and women, with many others wounded.<br><br>
Terrorist Ariel Sharon, the commander of the "101" unit which undertook the
terrorist aggression, stated that his leaders' orders had been clear with
regard to how the residents of the village were to be dealt with. He says,
"The orders were utterly clear: Qibya was to be an example to everyone."<br><br>
The government of Israel claimed that the massacre was carried out by
“civilian Jewish settlers”. But records showed that it was sanctioned by
acting Prime Minister Moshe Sharrett, and was planned by Defence Minister
Pin Has Lavon, the Chief of General Staff Mordacai Maklet, and Chief of
Operations, General Moshe Dayan. On October 26, General Van Bennike
testified before the UN Security Council. He gave irrefutable evidence that
the attack on Qibya was undertaken by regular army units of Israel and not
by irregulars as claimed by official Israeli sources.</p><br>
