<div align="center"><font color="Blue"><font size="+3"><b>The massacre of Deir Yasin - 09.04.1948</b></font></font></div><br>
<p>On the night of April 9, 1948, the Irgun Zvei Leumi surrounded the
village of Deir Yasin, located on the outskirts of Jerusalem. After
giving the sleeping residents a 15 minute warning to evacuated,
Menachem Begin's terrorists attacked the village of 700 people,
killing 254 mostly old men, women and children and wounding 300
others. Begin's terrorists tossed many of the bodies in the village
well, and paraded 150 captured women and children through the Jewish
sectors of Jerusalem.<br><br>
The Haganah and the Jewish Agency, which publicly denounced the
atrocity after the details had become public several days later, did
all they could to prevent the Red Cross from investigating the attack.
It wasn't until three days after the attack that the Zionist armies
permitted Jacques de Reynier, chief representative of the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Jerusalem, to visit the
village by the surrounding Zionist armies.<br><br>
Ironically, the Deir Yasin villagers had signed a non aggression pact
with the leaders of the adjacent Jewish Quarter, Giv'at Shaul and had
even refused military personnel from the Arab Liberation Army from
using the village as a base.</p><br>

Chief representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross</b></center>
<p>"On Saturday, April 10, in the afternoon, I received a telephone call
from the Arabs begging me to go at once to Deir Yasin where the
civilian population of the whole village has just been massacred.<br><br>
"I learned that the Irgun extremists hold this sector, situated near
Jerusalem. The Jewish Agency and the Haganah's General Headquarters
say that they know nothing about this matter and furthermore it is
impossible for anyone to penetrate an Irgun area.<br><br>
"They advise me that I not become involved in this matter as my
mission will run the risk of being permanently cut short if I go
there. Not only can they not help me but they also refuse all
responsibility for what will certainly happen to me. I answer that I
intend to go there at once, that the notorious Jewish Agency exercises
its authority over the territory in Jewish hands and that the agency
is responsible for my freedom of action within the bounds of my
mission.<br><br>
"In fact, I do not know at all how to do it. Without Jewish support it
is impossible to reach that village. After thinking I suddenly
remember that a Jewish nurse from a hospital here had made me take her
telephone number, saying with a strange look that if I ever were in a
difficult situation I could call her. On a chance I call her late in
the evening and tell her the situation. She tells me to be in a
predetermined location the following day at 7 o'clock and to take in
my car the person who will be there.<br><br>
"The next day on the hour and in the location upon which we agreed, an
individual in civilian clothes, but with pistols stuffed in his
pockets, jumps into my car and tells me to drive without stopping. At
my request, he agrees to show me the road to Deir Yasin, but he admits
not being able to do to much more for me. We drive out of Jerusalem,
leave the main road and the last regular army post and we turn in on a
cross road. Very soon two soldiers stop us. They look alarming with
machine guns in full view and larger cutlasses at the belt.<br><br>
"I recognize the uniform of those I am looking for. I must leave the
car and lend myself to bodily search. Then I understand that I am a
prisoner. All seems lost when a very big fellow ... jostles his
friends, takes my hand ... He understands neither English nor French,
but in German we arrive at a perfect understanding. He tells me his
joy at seeing an ICRC delegate, for having been a prisoner in a camp
for Jews in Germany he owes his life to nothing else but our
intervention and three reprieves. He says that I am more than a
brother for him and that he will do anything I ask. ... We go to Deir
Yasin.<br><br>
"Having reached a ridge 500 meters from the village which we see
below, we must wait a long time for permission to go ahead. The
shooting from the Arab side starts every time somebody tries to cross
the road and the Commander of the Irgun detachment does not seem
willing to relieve me. Finally he arrives, young, distinguished,
perfectly correct, but his eyes have a strange, cruel, cold look. I
explain my mission to him which has nothing in common with that of a
judge or arbiter. I want to help the wounded and bring back the dead.<br><br>
"Moreover, the Jews have signed a pledge to respect the Geneva
Convention and my mission is therefore an official one. This last
statement provokes the anger of this officer who asks me to consider
once and for all that here it is the Irgun who are in command and
nobody else, not even the Jewish Agency with which they have nothing
in common.<br><br>
"My (guide) hearing the raised voices intervenes ... Suddenly the
officer tells me I can act as I see fit but on my own responsibility.
He tells me the story of this village populated by about 400 Arabs,
disarmed since always and living on good terms with the Jews who
encircled them. According to him, the Irgun arrived 24 hours
previously and ordered by loudspeaker the whole population to evacuate
all the buildings and surrender. There is a 15 minute delay in the
execution of the command. Some of the unhappy people came forward and
would have been taken prisoners and then turned loose shortly
afterwards toward the Arab lines. The rest did not obey the order and
suffered the fate they deserved. But one must not exaggerate for there
are only a few dead who would be buried as soon as the `clean up' of
the village is over. If I find a bodies, I can take them with me, but
there are certainly no wounded.<br><br>
"This tale gives me cold chills. "I return to Jerusalem to find an
ambulance and a truck that I had alerted through the Red Shield ... I
arrive with my convoy in the village and the Arab fire ceases. The
(Jewish) troops are in campaign uniforms with helmets. All the young
people and even the adolescents, men and women, are armed to their
teeth: pistols, machine guns, grenades, and also big cutlasses, most
of them still bloody, that they hold in their hands. A young girl with
the eyes of a criminal, shows me hers still dripping. She carries it
around like a trophy. This is the 'clean up' team which certainly has
accomplished its job very conscientiously.<br><br>
"I try to enter a building. About 10 soldiers surround me with machine
guns aimed at me. An officer forbids me to move from the spot. They
are going to bring the dead that are there, he says. I then get as
furious as ever before in my life and tell these criminals what I
think about the way they act, menacing them with the thunder I can
muster, then I roughly push aside those who surround me and enter the
building.<br><br>
"The first room is dark, completely in disorder, and empty. In the
second, I find among smashed furniture covers and all sorts of debris,
some cold bodies. There they have been cleaned up by machine guns then
by grenades. They have been finished by knives.<br><br>
"It is the same thing in the next room, but just as I am leaving, I
hear something like a sigh. I search everywhere, move some bodies and
finally find a small foot which is still warm. It is a little 10 year
old girl, very injured by grenade, but still alive. I want to take her
with me but the officer forbids it and blocks the door. I push him
aside and leave with my precious cargo protected by the brave (guide).<br><br>
"The loaded ambulances leaves with orders to return as soon as
possible. And because these troops have not dared to attack me
directly, it is possible to continue.<br><br>
"I give orders to load the bodies from this house on the truck. Then I
go on to the neighboring house and go on. Everywhere I encounter the
same terrible sight. I only find two persons still alive, two women,
one of whom is an old grandmother, hidden behind the firewood where
she kept immobile for at least 24 hours.<br><br>
"There were 400 persons in the village. About 50 had fled, three are
still alive, but the rest have been massacred on orders, for as I have
noticed, this troop is admirably disciplined and acts only on command.<br><br>
De Reynier continues that he returns to Jerusalem where he confronts
the Jewish Agency and scolds them for not exercising control over the
150 armed men and women responsible for the massacre.<br><br>
"I then go to see the Arabs. I say nothing about what I have seen, but
only that after a first quick visit to the spot there seems to be
several dead and I ask what I shall do or where to bring them ... they
ask me to see that a suitable burial be given them in a place which
will be recognizable later on. I pledge to do so and on my return to
Deir Yasin, I find the Irgun people in a very bad mood. They try to
stop me from approaching the village and I understand when I see the
number and above all the state of the bodies which have been lined up
on the main street. I demand firmly that they proceed with the burial
and insist on helping them. After some discussion, they begin actually
to scoop out a big grave in a small garden. It is impossible to verify
the identity of the dead, for they have no papers, but I wrote
accurately their descriptions with approximate age.<br><br>
"Two days later, the Irgun had disappeared from the spot and the
Haganah had taken possession. We have discovered different places
where the bodies have been piled up without either decency or respect
in the open air.<br><br>
"Back in my office I received two gentleman in civilian clothes, very
well dressed who had waited for more than one hour. It is the
commander of the Irgun detachment and his aide. They have prepared a
text they ask me to sign. It is a statement according to which I have
been received courteously by them, that I have obtained all the help
needed to accomplish my mission and I thank them for the aide they
gave me.<br><br>
"As I hesitate, I begin to discuss the statement, and they tell me
that if I care for my life I should sign immediately."<br><br>
Calling the statement contrary to fact, de Reynier refuses to sign.
Several days later in Tel Aviv, de Reynier says he approached by the
same two men who ask the ICRC to assist some of their Irgun soldiers.</p><br>
<center><b>Eye Witness</b></center>
<p>Former Haganah officer, Col. Meir Pa'el, upon his retirement from the
Israeli army in 1972, made the following public statement about Deir
Yasin that was published by Yediot Ahronot (April 4, 1972): "In the
exchange that followed four [Irgun] men were killed and a dozen were
wounded ... by noon time the battle was over and the shooting had
ceased. Although there was calm, the village had not yet surrendered.
The Irgun and LEHI men came out of hiding and began to `clean' the
houses. They shot whoever they saw, women and children included, the
commanders did not try to stop the massacre .... I pleaded with the
commander to order his men to cease fire, but to no avail. In the
meantime, 25 Arabs had been loaded on a truck and driven through Mahne
Yehuda and Zichron Yousef (like prisoners in a Roman `March of
Triumph'). At the end of the drive, they were taken to the quarry
between Deir Yasin and Giv'at Shaul, and murdered in cold blood ...
The commanders also declined when asked to take their men and bury the
254 Arab bodies. This unpleasant task was performed by two Gadna units
brought to the village from Jerusalem."<br><br>
Zvi Ankori, who commanded the Haganah unit that occupied Deir Yasin
after the massacre, gave this statement in 1982 about the massacre,
published by Davar on April 9, 1982: "I went into 6 to 7 houses. I saw
cut off genitalia and women's crushed stomaches. According to the
shooting signs on the bodies, it was direct murder."<br><br>
Dov Joseph, one time Governor of the Israel sector of Jerusalem and
later Minister of Justice, called the Deir Yassin massacre "deliberate
and unprovoked attack."<br><br>
Arnold Toynbee described it as comparable to crimes committed against
the Jews by Nazis.<br><br>
Menachem Beigin said "The massacre was not only justified, but there
would not have been a state of Israel without the victory at Deir
Yassin." Unashamed of their deed and unaffected by world condemnation,
the Zionist forces, using loud-speakers, roamed the streets of cities
warning Arab inhabitants "The Jericho road is still open," they told
Jerusalem Arabs "Fly from Jerusalem before you are killed, like those
in Deir Yassin."</p><br>
