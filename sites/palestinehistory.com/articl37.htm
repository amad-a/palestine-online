<p>By : Douglas L Perle<br><br>
Dear Mr. President;
<br><br>
Once again I am writing you about the support the United States of America
gives to the Israeli Government.
<br><br>
The map of the Gaza strip a thirteen miles long and at the widest point 4
miles. This is considered "Palestinian Territory". During the eight years of
negotiations (1992 to 2000) with the Israeli government and the
Palestinians. Eighteen Jewish "settlements" have appeared inside this
territory.
<br><br>
At the same time the private documents of the Israeli Governments "Secret
Israeli Manifest" Reads: "The Northern lands of the Palestinian territory of
Gaza are to be taken one farmer at a time. Until all land, that is prime
view property of the Mediterranean, is under Israeli control regardless of
the cost in Palestinian lives or lively hood. Note: Also, that destroying
the Orange and Olive groves is another means of antagonizing the Palestinian
population. This will further the case by removing these farms. This will
drive the Arabs into starvation and eventually they will not have the
strength to fight and will give up and leave these territories."
<br><br>
I make this Protest: The Israeli destruction of Orange & Olive groves, other
food sources vital to Palestinian life is a crime unto itself. And I am sure
that anyone interested in the environmental impact of this would be appalled
at the number of such farms destroyed by the Israeli Government. I know of
two properties belonged to Doctor Abid Tarazi and Doctor Atala Tarazi. One
Doctor is disabled by a stroke and both men have been performing life saving
work for the Palestinian people.
<br><br>
This crime against humanity is against even the Jewish faith in God. The
Israeli Government is acting like its nemesis the Nazi German Government of
1932 to 1945. To make that statement is not hard and well founded. The
Israel Government is a mirror image of the Nazi Government of Germany. The
Israeli Government is using the methods of the Nazi's. Taking homes, land,
and lives of those Palestinians daring to resist Israeli Defense Force's
(IDF) invasion into Palestinian Territory. Thus, the Israeli Government
calls the Palestinians terrorists, when in fact the Israelis are terrorizing
the Palestinians. This has been going on for two score and twelve years.
Yet, the ill equipped militia of the Palestinian Army has held off the
second most modern Military force on the planet. Why, if the Palestinians
are fighting for there home lands then which party is the terrorist?
<br><br>
Similar manifests for each area that the Israeli Defense Force and Israeli
Government wants to Own exist, the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Rafah to name a
few.
<br><br>
"Israel's peace process means you give up your Homeland or War. The issue is
here a systematic annexation of your land. In addition, a developed blue
prints; systematically planned many years ago from the Council on Foreign
Relation, and the World Jewish Congress, with the Headquarter in Manhattan."
<br><br>
The Palestinians are the unseen victims of the Jewish made "concentration
camps" for those who oppose the Israelis occupation.
<br><br>
Take a look at the city of Rafah in the southern end of the Gaza strip.
Weekly, the Israeli Military bulldoze twenty to thirty Palestinian homes.
This has been going on for years with the support of the United States of
America. This is "Jewish Justice" to the Palestinians who oppose them! Yet,
we the free people of the United States of America are culpable partners to
the Israeli's in this destruction.
<br><br>
I believe that it is the intent of the Israeli Government and Military to
level the city of Rafah! Rafah will be gone from existence by the end of
your first term in office. Unless we the free people of the United States of
America put a stop to this destruction.
<br><br>
A ruthless frenzied destruction by a once great country. Israel, a country
that has lost its moral sense and faith allowing hate to take the place of
what is right. Allowing military might to butcher anyone in its way with
total disregard for repeated international calls to stop the violence.
Violence Israel perpetrates by destroying Palestinian homes, farms, and
adding settlements inside Palestinian territory. Thus, making the cycle of
violence perpetual.
<br><br>
Stop this! Draw a time line on the boarders of Palestine and Israel. Make
the Israelis get out of Palestinian Territory once and for all for the good
of the world. Make the Israelis do the right thing for once. Not the selfish
things they are trying to pull over the world's eyes!
<br><br>
"An acrimonious argument erupted during the Israeli cabinet weekly session
last (September 2001) week between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
his foreign Minister Shimon Peres during which Sharon reportedly yelled at
Peres, saying "don't worry about American pressure, we control America."
<br><br>
According to the Israeli Hebrew radio, Yisrael Wednesday, Peres warned
Sharon that refusing to heed incessant American requests for a cease-fire
with the Palestinians would endanger Israeli interests and turn the US
against us.
<br><br>
At this point, a furious Sharon reportedly turned toward Peres, saying
"every time we do something you tell me America will do this and will do
that, I want to tell you something very clear, don't worry about American
pressure on Israel, we, the Jewish people control America, and the Americans
know it."
<br><br>
I refuse to believe that we the United States of America are going to let
Israel tell us what we are going to do. It is time we the People of America
defended the small, the weak, the poor and sent a message to the world that
freedom is alive. Like the Jewish people of world war two, no nation Israel
included will be tolerated nor allowed to exterminate another human race
again.
