<p>Peres, (1923-...), a Labor Party politician, was prime minister of Israel
twice. He first held that office from 1984 to 1986. He became prime
minister again in 1995 following the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. In 1996, Peres lost in national elections, and Benjamin
Netanyahu of the Likud bloc replaced him as prime minister.<br><br>
In the early and mid-1990's, both as foreign minister under Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and as prime minister himself, Peres played a major role in a
move for peace between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO). Peres, Rabin, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel
Peace Prize for their Middle East peace efforts.<br><br>
Peres served as prime minister in the unity government created by the Labor
Party and the Likud bloc in September 1984. The parties formed the
government after no party won a majority in the parliamentary elections.
The unity government lasted for 50 months. Under the agreement between
Labor and Likud, Peres (head of the Labor Party) served as prime minister
for 25 months. Yitzhak Shamir, head of Likud, was vice prime minister and
foreign minister. Under the agreement, the roles of Peres and Shamir were
reversed after 25 months in October 1986. As prime minister, Peres pledged
to withdraw Israeli troops that occupied Lebanon. The troops had invaded
Lebanon in 1982. In 1985, the Israeli forces withdrew from all of Lebanon
except a Security Zone along the Israeli border.<br><br>
In 1988, Labor and Likud formed a new coalition government with Shamir as
prime minister. Peres remained as vice prime minister and also became
finance minister. In 1990, the coalition collapsed, and Peres resigned from
his posts as vice prime minister and finance minister. Likud and small
parties formed a new coalition government in June with Shamir as prime
minister. Peres had become head of the Labor Party in 1977. In 1992, he
lost that post in a party election.<br><br>
Peres was born in Vishnevo, a small town near Minsk, that was then part of
Poland and is now part of Belarus. His family name was Persky. He changed
the name to Peres in the 1940's. Peres moved with his family to Palestine
in 1934. He later became active in the movement that resulted in the
creation of the nation of Israel in Palestine in 1948. In 1950, Peres was
sent to the United States as leader of a defense ministry delegation. While
there, he studied at New York University and Harvard University. He
returned to Israel in 1952.<br><br>
Peres was first elected to the Israeli Knesset (parliament) in 1959. He
helped form the Labor Party in 1968. He was minister of defense from 1974
to 1977. He served as foreign minister in 1987 and 1988 and from 1992 until
1995.</p><br><br>
