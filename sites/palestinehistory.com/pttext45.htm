<p>Ethiopia in 1985
forced the Israeli
government to stop
its covert airlift
of Falasha -
Ethiopian Jews - to
Israel. Since beginning the airlift in 1974 (when
persecution of the Falasha increased after the
fall of Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie), Israel
had airlifted some 12,000 members of the ancient
Jewish sect, which had existed in isolation from
the rest of the Jewish world since about the
second century BC. Israel resumed the airlift in
1989, and within $a few years most of the
approximately 14,000 remaining Falasha had
emigrated.</p>
