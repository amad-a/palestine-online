Our utmost admiration and sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who have sacrificed their lives in the name of humanity, freedom and peace. Let's hope that the hate amongst nations and peoples will not be passed on or inherited by our future generations. Let's start a new beginning. Let's wipe the slate clean. No more vengeance, we have to stop killing each other. We are all God's creations. May Allah have mercy on us.<br><hr>

                               Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel has made statements regarding his once held position of Minister of Defense, I quote:<br>
<br>
"Now that the violence in the Israeli Palestinian region has increased I am beginning to realize more and more that we should have killed Yasser Arafat in 1987 in Lebanon when we had the chance."<br>
<br>
What is so saddening about that statement is that is was made right in the middle of a peace talks betweent the two sides as I have said Ariel Sharon is a ruthless man his days as Minister of Defense have caused him to hate Palestinians.  I would also like to mention another story this one regards the USS Caine.  You know that ship that found that Palestinian boat with 50 tons of weapons on it?  Well something struck me as funny about that whole thing.  When the Israelis gained control of the ship the US found do you think they got rid of all the weapons.  NO!  What they probably did is take the weapons and give them to their own soldiers.  So in a way what is being shot at the Palestinians right now are their own weapons that Yasser Arafat bought for them.  So tell me something is it fair that when the United States owes a 62 BILLION dollar global debt, that they take 28.6 BILLION dollars a year out of their budget and give it to Israel for "aide."  After the money is given to Israel do you think someone monitors how it is spent? NO! And one more question what do you think that "aide" really is?  Well if you can"t figure it out i will tell you.  The "aide" is money given to Israel from the United States to buy weapons from the United States.  So is it really fair that Israeli is allowed to have weapons, but the Palestinians are not? NO! It isn't fair.  To people like the son who are most evidently confused, there is a such thing as OCCUPATION.  If you read United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 (and i suggest everyone does) you will find the ORIGINAL boundaries set out for both Israel and Palestine from 1948 and on. I will quote: <br>
<br>
"The borders of the NATION of Palestine are to extend north to create the southern most border to Lebanon.  From that point Palestine is to have its uppermost part border the Mediterranean Sea."<br>
<br>
   As we can see neither the border to Lebanon nor the border to the sea has occured the  reason being occupation. So now I will leave you please take time to read RESOLUTION 181, and you may also wish to take a look at the Israeli plan of action for  occupation, PLAN DALET. I hope that after you have people understand the ruthlessness of ARIEL SHARON and his army.  Condolences to all MARTYRS, you are entitled to the right of AL-AWDA (the right of return), I will rise up along with the others who know your rights.  We will find you peace and freedom forever, IN MY LIFETIME (and trust me I am 14 so we have a while).<br>

I heard on the television today an Israel spokesman say "The stories of recent massacres are untrue". Wasn't someone else saying that 50 years ago? I am only realising the amount the American government is giving to Israel to continue this, this is not a slight on the American people, only on the system we have. My thoughts and prayers are with the Palestinians.<br><hr>

I feel as if I have no right to feel so horrible about something from which I am physically far removed.  However, I do feel utter sadness and know the Palestinian people feel it a million times more acutely.  The Palestinians are a strong, noble, beautiful people.  I have no idea how or when this hell will end for them (and for the people of Israel) but I want the Palestinians to know that I, a Euro-American, Christianized woman,  hope and pray that their suffering ends SOON and that their lives will flourish and prosper when it is over.  I do support an end to the occupation of your home.  My love and condolences to the families the martyrs left behind.  I am also a mother.<br><hr>

In my situation in 
which i found that,the resistance of the people of palestine is a thing of 
proud,im in a shame ,because my granpa was jewish his name was celestino,i feel 
the presence of the martirs,in my room, and i cry,the photos here in puerto rico 
in newspapers of fathers crying with terrible pain for theirs son and daugthers 
are heavy,my bro,the people of palestine are wonderful,and very beautiful, both 
the girls and guys are beautiful . I understand the criminal and terrible 
machine of destruction of zionist state, i see CNN and newspapers everyday, both 
zionist soldiers are one thing and israelis innocent civil is other thing, 
personally i believe if zionist soldiers invade autonomus territories of 
palestine nation israelis soldiers want only one thing occupation and it is 
legal, i believe national authority of palestine the existence of the organism 
is a legitimate reality and legitimate is the fight and the state of war of 
jihad.<hr>

If I could add one thing to my previous post, my heart also goes out to the Israeli civilians who are being killed as well as the Palestinians. We all know that many Israelis are opposed to Ariel Sharon's tactics, including some of his own forces. But if I came to settle in a land and knew that I had robbed someone of their home or land to do it, I would never be able to live happily there. Maybe that is what it is all about. I have had a fierce argument with other Christian friends about this. Occupation is wrong!<br><hr>

I would say the same thing as Ingrid, my heart is breaking for what is happening. I am a mother and I looked at the picture in Newsweek of the little sister of Ayat al-Akhras, she was holding a plastic toy and the look on her face is one that one should never see on a child's face, a look of complete horror and disbelief. I wrote and found out the demographics of the region, it is a mix of Christian, Muslim and Jew. We can only pray that the bloodshed will stop. I am shamed that the only reason (I feel) the United States even has peace envoys in the region is due to an ulterior motive. I believe Christ's heart must be deeply broken by what is going on. I am rambling, but my heart goes out to the Palestinian people. I do not believe this is the recreated Israel of God's plan, but a purely political entity with a Masada complex. As Ingrid said, we are U.S. civilians and cannot effect any change. But we as individuals can pray.  God bless.<br><hr>

My deepest condolences go out to families of the Martyrs of Palestine.<br>
We pray day and night for the end of our people's suffering, and an end to the killing of innocent men, woman and children.  Our hearts bleed everytime we hear of more senseless killing and destruction by people who don't know the meaning of humanity.  How can Sharon and all his followers call themselves human when they show everyday that they have no respect for ANY human life?  How could they cold-bloodedly aim their tanks and their weapons at children who fight with nothing but mere stones? Those children show the whole world that they are the true heroes while the jewish soldiers cower in fear behind their tanks and their weapons.  The day will come when those responsible will pay a dear price for their crimes, and our children will finally live in peace.  God bless Palestine and all it's heroes.<br><hr>

23:04:20 (CDT)<br><br><b>Comments:</B><br>It was through 
isolation and ignorance that we have come to consider ourselves as something 
more than children of our Creator. We have placed names upon ourselves such as 
American, French, Christian, Jewish or Muslem. It is through these man made 
classifications that we can then kill other children of God without conscience. 
Accept that we are all the children of God, and nothing more. Including all 
women, women are the children of God too. Not the chattel of man. Everything in 
the Universe is the creation and property of God. It is not ours to use for 
selfish reasons. Greed is disresect of God. We must share that which God has 
given, all, with all. We must not disrespect God by wasting and hording what God 
has given to all. You may believe you can take my life, but when you do, you 
really are taking your own in the the eyes of God. Only God can be the Judge, 
how dare we think we can judge what God has created, even the killer of our 
brother. Because when we do, we start an endless cycle of hatered and bloodshed 
that has no end. My love is for the tortured, abused and murdered children of 
God around the world, not the attacker, regardless of their reasoning. Beloved 
people of the land called Palestine, please use reason and love, not anger and 
revenge. May God make all people all over the world understand we are all 
nothing but children of God. Denounce titles, labels and class. The only way to 
world peace is to do for God only and never for ourselves. <br>

recieve peace in your lives. That the seemingly endless indignity that you 
living with will end soon. Israel has lost all moral superiority and has lost 
their right to claim any religious higher ground. They have sunken to the same 
level as Germany did during World War Two. You, the Palestinians are now in the 
Ghettos and are experiencing your "Crystal Night". May you soon see the light of 
freedom!<br>

to all who suffer. please search for alternatives to the violence. like begets 
like. it is the universal law. rise above the murder and bloodshed. look at what 
gandhi accomplished. think and dream and pray for peace. what we think is what 
we become. around the world we watch this tragedy unfold, everyday. last night i 
saw two palestinian children watching their dear mother carried away on a 
strecher by israeli solders. the woman died, killed by the blast to break down 
the door. on the same show, i saw a young russain girl of 14 years who was 
disfigured and crippled for the rest of her life by a suicide bomber. heartbreak 
all around. may a solution be found to restore dignity and freedom to all who 
have been denied it. the world is watching. peace be with you.<br>

age I am very active in making people aware fo the suffering of the Palestinans 
for so long. There are many people who critisize beliefs like mine and yours, 
but we know who is right. It is with deepest sadness that I express condolences 
for those you have lost to Israeli occupation of your entitled settlements. It 
is unfair that the Israeli's overpower you so much. The world must know the acts 
of terror the Israeli's commit every day. Taking bull dozers to Palestinian home 
that have been there for centuries is a ruthless action. I hope in the near 
future the world realizes your struggle. I do not condone actions of my 
government in their support of Israel. Ariel Sharon is a ruthless and unkind man 
and he must be exposed to the world for this. His statements about the need to 
kill Yasser Arafat only slow the peace process. Is is unfourtunate that the odds 
are so heavily on the side of Israel that they are able to keep Arafat held up 
in Ramallah without some outside nation even saying a word. Please knoe that I 
feel for you. I am very familiar with the documents that entitle you to land. 
Please undersatnd that just because our government does not support you does not 
mean some individual Americans do not.<br><br>If you have any questions regarding my knowledge of the 
situation or any other topic please write me.<br>CPTPOLDARK@AOL.COM<br>Sincerely,<br>Cameron Pond <br>High School Student <br>United States of America<br>

waramatulahi wa barakatu and shalom, I pray for peace in the whole world. peace 
between the jews and the palestinians. We are all gods children , why must we 
kill each other . there is enough for everybody . It is very hard to believe 
what we read and see on tv . each side has their own truth ... what is the real 
truth .? I&nbsp;wish both the jews and the palestinians peace . a lot of us 
forget that a good % of palestinians are christians!</DIV>
<DIV align=justify><br>I&nbsp;wonder if 
the other Arab countries would give land to the palestinians and turn the other 
cheek to israel . even if the jews&nbsp;have a claim , their behaviour towards 
the humanbeings besides them is shameful. How come there are refugee camps in 
palestine and none in israel? how come? Have they forgotten hitler ? should they 
not have more empathy due to their past? How come the palestinians are not 
allowed to have an army like israel? and weapons of mass destruction like 
israel? No wonder the bullied people have no choice but to have sucide bombers. 
It is the meek that shall inherit the earth . Love thy neighbour like you love 
thy self.</DIV>
<DIV align=justify><br>We love god as 
much as we love the least of his creatures.peace be on jesus, nabi issa. Also a 
saying by mahatma gandhi ... life is one indivisible whole, we cannot do good in 
one corner of our life and do bad in another, life is one indivisible whole. The 
hindus and the muslims of india should also remember this .<br>God , Allah , has trusted us with free will , let us be 
worthy of gods trust in us. let us remember that god is love . let us not forget 
that god is watching us . once again , let us not only pray for peace but act in 
peace . may the abundance of the universe flow through each one of us . </DIV>
<DIV align=justify><br>Inshallah!<br>Let us not forget that it is from god we come and to god we 
go.<br>

Palistinians. How do Israelis defend the way they pushed Palistinians off their 
land to create Israel? How do they live surrounding all those refugees camps 
after what camps meant to their people? In their hearts the Jews must know the 
monumental wrong done the Palistinians. They will never give up land but the 
Jews should pay Palistinians $25,000 - $50,000 each so they can build lives 
outside the camps. Muslims should understands Americans do NOT know the details 
of the creation of Israel and most Americans do not care. If PLO leaders would 
speak publicly about the history of the Palistinian cause, it would help the 
world understand your struggles. Good luck.<br></DIV>

to reach peace is to stop the suicide-attacks. Then Sharon will no langer have 
an excuse for the occupation of Palestine. As long as the suicide-attacks will 
go on, the USA will support the Israeli's right to "defend" themselves against 
the Palestinians. So only if the attacks wil stop, the whole world will condemn 
any Israeli agression and will support the foundation of a Palestinian State on 
the Westbank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.<br>I hope the 
Palestinians will set aside their hate against Israel and use all their energie 
to reach the only goal that counts: The foundation of the state Palestine. <br></DIV>

perfect or beautiful as the american media portrays it. It has the ring of 
terror from the distant past. Terror, that the Jewish people themselves went 
through. The Jewish people are now terrorizing the Arab people. The Israel 
Government is a mirror image of the Nazi Government of Germany. The Israeli 
Government is using the methods of the Nazi's, taking homes, land, and lives of 
those Palestinians. and who's doing all this? A WAR CRIMINAL by the name of 
Sharon, who is wanted in the courts of Brussels for the massive massacre of over 
1500 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps.. and now hes a Prime 
Minister..what has the world come to????????????<br></DIV>
