<p>At 4:30 P.M., October 29, 1956, a sergeant from the border guard informed
the mayor of Kufr Qasim Wadi Ahmad Sarsour, that a curfew would be imposed
on the village, and asked him to inform village residents. Only 30 minutes
before the new curfew time, the mayor tried to convince the officer that
about 400 villagers whose work took them outside the village would not be
able to able to receive the warning in time. The officer told him that his
soldiers would take care of that. The villagers who were home complied.
Meanwhile the officers posted themselves at the village gates. Before long
the first batch of villagers back home on bicycles, came into sight unaware
of the curfew. They were met by the soldiers who shot them at a close
range. Others, unaware of the danger awaiting them, started to reach the
village entrance. They were met with the same fate.<br><br>
After this terrorist massacre was over, border guard policemen gathered
together the corpses of the 49 victims, took them in a truck and threw them
into a thicket located near the police station in the Israeli settlement in
Ra's al-'Ayn, where the bodies were buried temporarily. However, two days
later they decided to bury them in the village cemetery.</p><br>
