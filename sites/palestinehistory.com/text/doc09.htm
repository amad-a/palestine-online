The Proclamation of 'Israel's Independence'
-------------------------------------------

The  Land  of  Israel  was the birthplace of the Jewish people.
Here  their  spiritual,  religious  and  national  identity was
formed.  Here  they achieved independence and created a culture
of  national  and  universal  significance. Here they wrote and
gave the Bible to the world.

Exiled  from  the  Land  of  Israel, the Jewish people remained
faithful  to it in all the countries of their dispersion, never
ceasing  to  pray and hope for their return and the restoration
of their national freedom.

Impelled  by  this hiostoric association Jews strove throughout
the  centuries  to  go  back  to  the land of their fathers and
regain  their  statehood.  In  recent  decades they returned in
their  masses.  They  reclaimed  the  wilderness,  rvived their
language, built cities and villages, and established a vigorous
and  ever-growing community, with its own economic and cultural
life. They sought peace yet were prepared to defend themselves.
They  brought  the  blessings of progress to all inhabitants of
the country and looked forward to sovereign independence.

In  the  year  1897  the  First  Zionist  Congress, inspired by
Theodor  Herzl's  vision  of  the  Jewish State, proclaimed the
right  of  the  Jewish  people to national revival in their own
country. This right was acknowledged by the Balfour Declaration
of  November  2,  1917,  and  re-affirmed by the mandate of the
League   of   Nations,   which   gave   explicit  international
recognition  to  the  historic  connection of the Jewish people
with  Palestine  and their right to reconstitute their National
Home.

The  recent  holocaust,  which  engulfed  millions  of  Jews in
Europe,  proved  anew  the  need  to  solve  the problem of the
homelessness  and  lack of independence of the Jewish people by
means  of the re-establishment of the Jewish State, which would
open  the  gates  to  all Jews and endow the Jewish people with
equality of status among tyhe family of nations.

The  survivors  of the disastrius slaughter in Europe, and also
Jews  from other lands, have not desisted from efforts to reach
Eretz  Israel,  in  face of difficulties, obstacles and perils;
and  have  not ceased to urge their right to a life of dignity,
freedom and honest toil in their ancestral land.

In  the  Second  World  War the Jewish people in Palestine made
their  full  contribution to the struggle of the freedom-loving
nations against the Nazi evil. The sacrifices of their soldiers
and  their  war  effort  gained them the right to rank with the
nations which founded the United Nations. On November 29, 1947,
the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Resolution
requiring the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The
General Assembly caloled upon the inhabitants of the country to
take all the necessary steps on their part to put the plan into
effect.  This recognition by the United Nations of the right of
the  Jewish  people  to  establish  their  independent State is
unassailable.

It  is the natural right of the Jewish peole to lead, as do all
other nations, an independent existence in its sovereign State.

ACCORDINGLY   WE,   the   members   of  the  National  Council,
representing  the  Jewish  people  in  Palestine, and the World
Zionist  Movement,  are  met together in solemn assembly today,
the  day  of  termination of the British mandate for Palestine;
and  by  virtue of the natural and historic right of the Jewish
people  and  of  the  Resolution of the General Assembly of the
United Nations.

WE  HEREBY  PROCLAIM  the  establishment of the Jewish State in
Palestine  to be called 'Medinal Israel' (The State of Israel).
WE  HEREBY DECLARE that, as from the termination of the British
Mandate  at  midnight, the 14th-15th May, 1948, and pending the
setting  up  of  the  duly  elected  bodies  of  the  State  in
accordance   with  a  Constitution,  to  be  drwan  up  by  the
Constituent  Assembly not later than the 1st October, 1948, the
National  Council  shall  act as the Provisional State Council,
and  that  the  National  Administration  shall  constitute the
Provisional  Government  of  the  Jewish  State, which shall be
known as Israel.

THE  STATE  OF ISRAEL will be open for immigration of Jews from
all countries of their dispersion; will promote the development
of  the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; will be
based  on  the  principles  of  liberty,  justice  and peace as
conceived  by  the  Prophets  of  Israel,  will uphold the full
social  and  political  equality  of  all its citizens, without
distinction  of religion, race or sex;will guarantee freedom of
religion, conscience, education and culture; will safeguard the
Holy  Places  of  all  religions;  and  will loyally uphold the
principles of the United Nations Charter.

THE  STATE OF ISRAEL will be ready to cooperate with the organs
and representatives of the United Nations in the implementation
of  the  Resolution  of the Assembly of November, 29, 1947, and
will take steps to bring about Economic Union over the whole of
Palestine. We appeal to the United Nations to assist the Jewish
people  in  the  building of its State and to admit Israel into
the  family  of  Nations. In the midst of wanton aggression, we
yet  call  upon  the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to
preserve  the  ways  of  peace  and  play  their  part  in  the
development  of  the  State,  on  the  basis  of full and equal
citizenship  and  due  representation  in  all  its  bodies and
institutions - provisional and permanent.

We  extend  our  hand  in  peace and neighbourliness to all the
neighbouring  states  and  their  peoples,  and  invite them to
co-operate  with  the  independent Jewish nation for the common
good  of  all.  The  State  of  Israel  is prepared to make its
contribution to the progress of the Middle East as a whole.

Our  call  goes  out to the Jewish people all over the world to
rally  to  our  side in the task of immigration and development
and  to stand by us in the great struggle for the fulfilment of
the dream of generations for the redemption of Israel.

With   trust   in  Almighty  God,  we  set  our  hand  to  this
Declaration,  at this Session of the Provisional State Council,
on  this  Sabbath  eve, the fifth of Iyar, 5708, the fourteenth
day of May, 1948.
