Sykes Picot Agreement
---------------------
16-May-1916
-----------
Letter 1: From Sir Edward Grey To Paul Cambon May 16, 1916

I shall have the honor to reply fully in a further note to your
excellency's  note of the 9th instant, relative to the creation
of  an  Arab  state, but i should meanwhile be grateful if your
excellence  could  assure me that in those regions which, under
the  conditions recorded in that communication, become entirely
french,   or  in  which  french  interests  are  recognized  as
predominant,   any  existing  British  concessions,  rights  of
navigation or development, and the rights and privileges of any
British  religious, scholastic, or medical institutions will be
maintained.  His  majesty's government are, of course, ready to
give  a reciprocal assurance in regard to the British area. Sir
Edward Grey


Letter 2: From Sir Edward Grey To Paul Cambon May 16, 1916

I   have   the   honor  to  acknowledge  the  receipt  of  your
excellency's  note  of the 9th instant, stating that the french
government  accept  the  limits  of  a  future  Arab  state, or
confederation  of  states,  and  of  those parts of Syria where
french  interests predominate, together with certain conditions
attached  thereto,  such as they result from recent discussions
in  London  and  petrograd  on the subject. I have the honor to
inform  your  excellency  in  reply  that the acceptance of the
whole project, as it now stands, will involve the abdication of
considerable   British  interests,  but,  since  his  majesty's
government  recognize the advantage to the general cause of the
allies   entailed   in  producing  a  more  favorable  internal
political  situation  in  turkey,  they are ready to accept the
arrangement  now  arrived at, provided that the co-operation of
the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfill the conditions
and  obtain the towns of homs, hama, damascus and aleppo. It is
accordingly   understood   between   the   french  and  British
governments:

1.  That France and great Britain are prepared to recognize and
protect  an  independent Arab states or a confederation of Arab
states  (a)  and  (b)  marked  on  the  annexed  map, under the
suzerainty  of  an  Arab chief. That in area (a) France, and in
area  (b)  great  Britain,  shall  have  priority  of  right of
enterprise  and  local  loans.  That in area (a) France, and in
area  (b) great Britain, shall alone supply advisers or foreign
functionaries at the request of the Arab state or confederation
of Arab states.

2.  That  in  the  blue  area France, and in the red area great
Britain,  shall be allowed to establish such direct or indirect
administration  or control as they desire and as they may think
fit  to  arrange  with  the Arab state or confederation of Arab
states.

3.  That  in  the  brown  area  there  shall  be established an
international  administration,  the  form  of  which  is  to be
decided  upon  after consultation with Russia, and subsequently
in  consultation with the other allies, and the representatives
of the sheriff of mecca.

4.  That  great  Britain be accorded (1) the ports of Haifa and
acre,  (2) guarantee of a given supply of water from the tigres
and   euphrates  in  area  (a)  for  area  (b).  His  majesty's
government,  on their part, undertake that they will at no time
enter  into negotiations for the cession of Cyprus to any third
power without the previous consent of the french government.

5.  That Alexandretta shall be a free port as regards the trade
of   the   British   empire,   and   that  there  shall  be  no
discrimination in port charges or facilities as regards British
shipping  and  British  goods;  that  there shall be freedom of
transit  for  British goods through Alexandretta and by railway
through  the  blue  area,  or  (b) area, or area (a); and there
shall be no discrimination, direct or indirect, against British
goods  on  any railway or against British goods or ships at any
port serving the areas mentioned.

6.  That  Haifa  shall  be  a free port as regards the trade of
France,  her dominions and protectorates, and there shall be no
discrimination  in port charges or facilities as regards french
shipping  and  french  goods. There shall be freedom of transit
for  french  goods  through  Haifa  and  by the British railway
through the brown area, whether those goods are intended for or
originate  in  the  blue area, area (a), or area (b), and there
shall  be no discrimination, direct or indirect, against french
goods  on  any railway, or against french goods or ships at any
port serving the areas mentioned.

7.  That  in  area (a) the Bagdad railway shall not be extended
southwards  beyond  Mosul,  and  in  area (b) northwards beyond
Samarra,  until  a railway connecting Bagdad and aleppo via the
euphrates  valley  has  been  completed, and then only with the
concurrence of the two governments.

8.  That  great Britain has the right to build, administer, and
be  sole owner of a railway connecting Haifa with area (b), and
shall  have  a perpetual right to transport troops along such a
line  at  all times. It is to be understood by both governments
that  this  railway  is  to facilitate the connection of Bagdad
with  Haifa  by rail, and it is further understood that, if the
engineering  difficulties  and expense entailed by keeping this
connecting  line  in  the  brown  area  only  make  the project
unfeasible,  that  the  french  government shall be prepared to
consider that the line in question may also traverse the Polgon
Banias  Keis  Marib  Salkhad  tell Otsda Mesmie before reaching
area (b).

9.  For  a  period of twenty years the existing Turkish customs
tariff  shall  remain in force throughout the whole of the blue
and red areas, as well as in areas (a) and (b), and no increase
in the rates of duty or conversions from ad valorem to specific
rates shall be made except by agreement between the two powers.

10.  There shall be no interior customs barriers between any of
the above mentioned areas. The customs duties leviable on goods
destined  for  the  interior  shall be collected at the port of
entry  and  handed  over  to  the administration of the area of
destination.

11.  It  shall  be agreed that the french government will at no
time  enter  into  any  negotiations  for  the cession of their
rights  and  will  not cede such rights in the blue area to any
third  power,  except  the  Arab state or confederation of Arab
states,   without  the  previous  agreement  of  his  majesty's
government, who, on their part, will give a similar undertaking
to the french government regarding the red area.

12. The British and french government, as the protectors of the
Arab  state,  shall agree that they will not themselves acquire
and  will  not  consent  to a third power acquiring territorial
possessions  in  the  Arabian peninsula, nor consent to a third
power  installing  a naval base either on the east coast, or on
the  islands,  of the red sea. This, however, shall not prevent
such  adjustment  of  the  Aden frontier as may be necessary in
consequence of recent Turkish aggression.

13. The negotiations with the Arabs as to the boundaries of the
Arab  states  shall  be  continued  through the same channel as
heretofore on behalf of the two powers.

14.  It  is  agreed that measures to control the importation of
arms  into  the  Arab territories will be considered by the two
governments.

I  have  further  the honor to state that, in order to make the
agreement  complete,  his majesty's government are proposing to
the  Russian  government  to  exchange notes analogous to those
exchanged by the latter and your excellency's government on the
26th  April last. Copies of these notes will be communicated to
your  excellency  as soon as exchanged. I would also venture to
remind  your  excellency  that  the  conclusion  of the present
agreement  raises, for practical consideration, the question of
claims of Italy to a share in any partition or rearrangement of
turkey  in Asia, as formulated in article 9 of the agreement of
the  26th  April,  1915,  between  Italy  nd  the  allies.  His
majesty's   government   further  consider  that  the  Japanese
government   should   be   informed  of  the  arrangements  now
concluded. Sir Edward Grey


Letter 1: From Sir Edward Grey To Count Benckendorff
May 10/23, 1916

I  have received from the french ambassador in London copies of
the  notes exchanged between the Russian and french governments
on  the  26th  ultimo,  by  which  your  excllency's government
recognize,  subject to certain conditions, the arrangement made
between  great Britain and France, relative to the constitution
of  an Arab state or a confederation of Arab states, and to the
partition   of   the   territories   os   Syria,  Cilicia,  and
Mesopotamia,  provided  that  the  co-operation of the Arabs is
secured.  His  majesty's  government take act with satisfaction
that  your  excellency's  government  concur  in the limits set
forth  in  that arrangement, and i have now the honor to inform
your  excellency  that his majesty's government, on their part,
in order to make the arrangement complete, are also prepared to
recognize  the  conditions formulated by the Russian government
and accepted by the french government in the notes exchanged at
petrograd  on  the  26th  ultimo.  In  so  far,  then, as these
arrangements  directly affect the relations of Russia and great
Britain,  i  have  the honor to invite the acquiescence of your
excellency's government in an agreement on the following terms:

1.  That Russia shall annex the regions of Erzeroum, Trebizond,
van, and Bitlis, up to a point subsequently to be determined on
the littoral of the black sea to the west of Trebizond.

2.  That  the  region  of  Kurdistan to the south of van and of
Bitlis  between  Mush,  Sert, the course of the Tigris, Jezireh
Ben  Omar,  the  crest  line  of  the  mountains which dominate
Amadia,  and the region or Merga Var, shall be ceded to Russia;
and that starting from the region of Merga Var, the frontier of
the  Arab  state  shall  follow the crest line of the mountains
which  at  present  divide  the  ottoman and Persian dominions,
these  boundaries  are  indicated  in  a general manner and are
subject  to modifications of detail to be proposed later by the
delimitation commission which shall meet on the spot.

3.  That the Russian government undertake that, in all parts of
the  ottoman  territories thus ceded to Russia, and concessions
accorded to British subjects by the ottoman government shall be
maintained,  if  the Russian government express the desire that
such  concessions  should  later  be modified in order to bring
them  into  harmony  with  the laws of the Russian empire, this
modification  shall  only  take  place  in  agreement  with the
British government.

4.  That  in  all  parts  of  the  ottoman territories ceded to
Russia,  existing British rights of navigation and development,
and  the  rights  and  privileges  of  any  British  religious,
scholastic,  or  medical  institutions shall be maintained. His
majesty's  government,  on  their  part, undertake that similar
Russian  rights  and  privileges  shall  be maintained in those
regions  which,  under the conditions of this agreement, become
entirely  British, or in which British interests are recognized
as predominant.

5.  The  two  governments  admit  in principle that every state
which  annexes any part of the ottoman empire is called upon to
participate in the service of the ottoman debt. Sir Edward Grey


Letter  2:  From  Sir  Edward  Grey  To Count Benckendorff Oct.
10/23, 1916

In reply to your excellency's note of the 1st ultimo, regarding
the  arrangement  between  great  Britain,  Russia, and France,
relative   to   the   creation  of  an  Arab  state,  or  of  a
confederation  of  Arab  states,  and  to  the partition of the
territories  of  Syria, Cilicia, and Mesopotamia, provided that
the  cooperation  of  the Arabs is secured, i have the honor to
state   that   his   majesty's  government  take  note  of  the
reservation  formulated  by  the imperial Russian government at
the  end  of article 4 of the arrangement respecting the rights
of  the imperial government to grant cabotage in the black sea,
and  of  the  desire  manifested  by  that government that this
question should be submitted later to a friendly examination by
the governments of the parties interested.

Sir Edward Grey
