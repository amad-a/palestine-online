Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)
-------------------------------------

The  first  elected  Palestinian  Legislative  Council  (PLC) was initially
conceptualized  with  the  Declaration  of  Principles  (DOP). The idea was
further  developed in the Israel-Palestinian Interim Agreement (Oslo II) in
which the structure, jurisdiction, functions, size, and responsibilities of
the Council were determined.

The  PLC,  is to replace the Palestinian Authority upon it inauguration. As
such,  the  Council  is  expected  to  act  as the highest authority in the
interim  phase. The PLC is the body responsible for legislation and from it
the majority (80% of the cabinet) of the Executive Authority is appointed.</p></pre>

Committees of the Council
-------------------------

The  Council  established eleven permanent committees at its second meeting
on  April  4,  1996.  Under Title III of the Standing Rules, the committees
review  and  propose  amendments  to  legislation,  report  to the Council,
receive  constituent  complaints,  and  study  and  review plans, programs,
agreements,  and  treaties  submitted  to  the  Council  by  the  Executive
Authority.  The  committees  discuss  and  report  to  the  Council  on any
proposals referred by the Council or by the Speaker. The committees usually
meet  twice  a  week  and  may  hold additional meetings at the call of the
chairman,  or by request of the Speaker or a majority of the members of the
committee, with at least 24 hours notice. The committees meet in secret but
can decide to hold public meetings. The quorum for a committee meeting is a
majority  of  its  members and decisions of the committees require a simple
majority.  Each committee has a chairman and a secretary elected from among
its  members.  A  committee  may  request,  through  the  Speaker, that any
relevant  Minister  or  responsible  person within the Palestinian National
Authority  give  information  or  clarify  any issue within the committee’s
mandate.  A  committee  may  also  ask  the Speaker to request, through the
President  of  the  Authority, the attendance of any relevant Minister at a
committee meeting.
