<pre><p align=center>Bethlehem  (pop. 16,313) is the birthplace of Jesus Christ. It lies about 5
miles  (8  kilometers)  south  of  Jerusalem in a region of the Middle East
called the West Bank.

The  Arabic  name  is  Bayta  lahm, which means house of meat. Bethlehem is
chiefly  a  religious  shrine.  It  has  many  houses  of worship and other
religious institutions.

In  1917,  during  World  War I, British forces led by General Edmund Henry
Hynman  Allenby took the town. It became under Jordan control in 1948 after
the  first  Arab-Israeli  war  in  1948  .  Israel  occupied the West Bank,
including  Bethlehem,  during  the  Six-Day  War  of  1967. In 1995, Israel
withdrew  from Bethlehem and gave control to Palestinian based on self-rule
agreement between PLO and Israel.</p></pre>
