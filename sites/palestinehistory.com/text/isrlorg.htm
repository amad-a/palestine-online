<pre><p align=center>Zionism
-------

Political  movement  advocating  the  establishment of a Jewish homeland in
Palestine, the ‘promised land’ of the Bible.

1896  As  a response to European anti-Semitism, Theodor Herzl published his
Jewish  State,  outlining  a  scheme  for  setting  up an autonomous Jewish
commonwealth .

1897 The World Zionist Congress was established in Basel, Switzerland, with
Herzl  as  its  first  president.  ‘Hatikva’  (The Hope) was adopted as the
Zionist  anthem,  which was the unofficial anthem of Israel until 1948 when
it was sung at the proclamation of the State of Israel on May 14.

1917 The Balfour Declaration was secured from Britain by Chaim Weizmann. It
promised the Jews a homeland in Palestine.

1940-48  Jewish settlement in the British mandate of Palestine led to armed
conflict   between   militant  Zionists  Irgun  and  Stern  Gang  and  both
Palestinian Arabs and the British.

1947 In Nov the United Nations (UN) issued a resulation in order to divided
Palestine  into  Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international
city.

1948  The  Jews  in Palestine proclaimed the State of Israel on May 14, but
the  Arab states rejected both the partition of Palestine and the existence
of  Israel. The armies of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen,  and  Egypt crossed Palestine borders and attacked but were defeated
by the Israeli army (Haganah).

1975  The General Assembly of the UN condemned Zionism as ‘a form of racism
and  racial discrimination’; among those voting against the resolution were
the USA and the members of the European Community (now the European Union).</p></pre>

Zionist  terrorist  group  founded  1940  by Abraham Stern (1907-1942). The
group carried out anti-British terrorist attacks during the UK mandate rule
in  Palestine,  both  on  individuals  and  on strategic targets. Stern was
killed  by  British forces in 1942, but the group survived until 1948, when

Zionist  terrorist  military organization in Palestine. It originated under
the Turkish rule of the Ottoman Empire before World War I to protect Jewish
settlements,  and  many of its members served in the British forces in both
world  wars.  After World War II it condemned guerrilla terrorist activity,
opposing the British authorities only passively. It formed the basis of the
Israeli army after Israel was established 1948.</p></pre>

Several  Jewish groups had been linked with terrorist attacks against Arabs
and  Britsh  in  the  West Bank and East Jerusalem. The best known of these
organizations,  the  Gush  Emunim  Underground (sometimes called the Jewish
Terror  Organization),  was  formed  in  1979  by prominent members of Gush
Emunim, a group of religious zealots who had used squatter tactics to carry
on a terrorist campaign to settle the West Bank after the October 1973 War.
The  underground  perceived the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 Treaty
of  Peace  Between  Egypt  and  Israel  as betraying the Begin government's
policy of retaining the territories conquered by Israel.

The principal terrorist actions of the Gush Emunim Underground were carried
out  between  1980  and  1984.  In 1980 car bombings of five West Bank Arab
mayors resulted in crippling two of the mayors. In 1983, the Hebron Islamic
College was the target of a machinegun and grenade attack that killed three
Arab  students and wounded thirty-three others. In 1984 an attempt was made
to  place explosive charges on five Arab buses in East Jerusalem. This plot
was foiled by agents of Israel's internal security force, Shin Bet, leading
to arrest and prison sentences for eighteen members of the underground. The
security  services also uncovered a well-developed plan to blow up the Dome
of  the Rock, one of Islam's most sacred shrines, on Al-Aqsa Mosque complex
in east Jerusalem's.</p></pre>

Another anti-Arab terrorist group, Terror Against Terror (known as TNT) was
established  by  Kach, the right-wing extremist political movement of Rabbi
Meir  Kahane.  TNT  was  responsible for numerous beatings and bombings and
several  murders  of  Arabs,  beginning  in  1975.  Defending Shield (Egrof
Magen),  a Jewish vigilante group of West Bank settlers formed in 1983, was
responsible  for  a number of attacks and vandalization of Arab property on
the  West  Bank.  During  the intifadah, beginning in late 1987, there were
many  reports of Jewish vigilantism, including shootings, punitive raids on
refugee   camps,   and  assaults  on  Arab  motorists  in  retaliation  for
rock-throwing  attacks  by  Arab  youths.  Most  of  these  appeared  to be
spontaneous actions by settlers of individual communities.</p></pre>

Herzog,  became  chief  rabbi  of Israel . Chaim attended the Government of
Palestine  Law  School  in  Jerusalem,  Cambridge  University,  and  London
University, where he earned a law degree. During World War II he was a tank
commander  with  Britain's  elite Guard Armored Division; he later directed
British  intelligence  in Germany, where he identified a captive soldier as
the  Nazi  chief  Heinrich  Himmler.  After the war he served in the Jewish
underground, Haganah, in Palestine.

After  serving  as  a  field  commander,  Herzog  became  chief of military

October  War  (1973),  of  which  he  wrote  a  candid  account, The War of
Atonement(1975).  Also in 1975, he became Israel's ambassador to the United
Nations,  where  he  denounced  the  General Assembly's resolution defining
Zionism as racism and defended Israel's rescue of Jewish hostages in Uganda
in  1976.  His book The Arab-Israeli Wars(1982) was widely praised. In 1981
he  became a Labor party member of Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. Highly
respected  by both major political parties, Herzog was elected to five-year

Meir,  Golda  (1898-1978),  served as prime minister of Israel from 1969 to
1974. During her political career, she supported large-scale immigration to
Israel  and major housing and other construction programs. Her main problem
as  prime  minister was the territorial conflict between Israel and several
Arab nations. Meir followed a firm but open policy toward the Arabs.

In  October  1973, war broke out for the fourth time between Israel and the
Arabs.  Israel  suffered  heavy  early  losses,  and  Meir's government was
severely  criticized.  As  a result, she resigned in June 1974, even though
she had led the Labor Party to victory in the December 1973 elections.

Golda  Meir  was  born Golda Mabovitz in Kiev, Ukraine. Her family moved to
Milwaukee  in 1906, and she later taught school there. In 1921, she went to
Palestine and joined a collective farm village.

In  1948,  part  of  Palestine  occupied  by Jewish and became Israel. Meir
served  as  Israel's minister of labor from 1949 to 1956 and as minister of

directed the Israeli victory in a six-day war fought against Egypt, Jordan,
and  Syria in June 1967. Dayan became Israel's foreign minister in 1977. He
resigned  in  1979  because  he  believed that the government was not doing
enough to bring about peace with the Arabs. He was minister of defense from
1967 to 1974, minister of agriculture from 1959 to 1964, and chief of staff
from 1953 to 1958.

Begin,  (1913-1992),  served as prime minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983.
The  leader  of  the  conservative  Likud Party, he came to power after the
party  won  a  majority  of  the seats in the Knesset (Israeli parliament).
After  the 1981 elections, the Likud Party and smaller conservative parties
formed  a coalition, and Begin remained prime minister. Begin resigned from
office in 1983.

In  1978,  Begin,  President  Anwar  el-Sadat of Egypt, and President Jimmy
Carter  held  discussions  in  the  United  States  about  ways  to end the
Arab-Israeli  conflict.  The discussions resulted in a major agreement that
included  plans  for  Israel's withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The
agreement  also  called  for  a  peace  treaty between Israel and Egypt. In
addition,   the   agreement   provided  for  Palestinian  autonomy  in  two
Israeli-occupied  territories  the West Bank, formerly ruled by Jordan; and
the  Gaza Strip, formerly administered by Egypt. Begin and Sadat shared the
1978  Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The treaty was signed in 1979. Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula
was  completed in 1982. Israel began to provide for Palestinian autonomy in
1994.

In  1981,  Begin's  government  claimed  legal and political authority over
Syria's Golan Heights. Syria and many other countries denounced this claim.
Israel  had  gained  control  of  the  area in a war against Syria in 1967.
Although Israel's relations with Egypt improved under Begin, relations with
other  Arab  nations remained hostile. For more details on the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

Begin  was  born  in  Brest-Litovsk,  Russia  (now  Brest, Belarus). In the
1930's,  he  became active in the Zionist movement. The Zionists called for
the  creation  of a Jewish nation in Palestine, which was then ruled by the
British.  Begin  moved to Palestine in 1942. There he joined the Irgun Zvai
Leumi,  an underground Jewish terrorist militia that fought the British and
the  Palestinian Arabs. He led the Irgun from 1944 to 1948, when Israel was
created in Palestine. He played a leading military role in the Arab-Israeli
war of 1948. He served in the Knesset from 1949 to 1984.</p></pre>

Rabin, (1922-1995), was prime minister of Israel from 1974 to 1977 and from
1992  until  his  death.  On Nov. 4, 1995, he was assassinated in Tel Aviv,
Israel.  A  right-wing  Israeli  university  student  who  opposed  Rabin's
policies confessed to the murder.

Rabin  was born in Jerusalem and was the nation's first prime minister born
in  Israel. Israel's previous prime ministers were born in Europe. In 1941,
during  World  War  II,  Rabin  joined  the  Palmach,  a unit of the Jewish
underground  terrorist  army  in  Palestine. He was deputy commander of the
Palmach  in  1948  during the first Arab-Israeli war. Rabin headed Israel's
defense  forces from 1964 to 1967. He planned the strategy in a 1967 war in
which  the  Israelis  defeated the Arabs and occupied the Arab lands of the
Gaza Strip and West Bank.

From 1968 to 1973, Rabin was ambassador to the United States. A Labor Party
member,  he  was  elected  to  Israel's parliament in 1973. He became Labor
Party  head and prime minister in 1974, and held those posts until 1977. He
was minister of defense from 1984 to 1990.

Rabin  again  became  Labor  Party head in February 1992. Elections in June
brought  the  party  to  power,  and  Rabin became prime minister again. He
appointed  himself minister of defense. In 1993, Rabin's government and the
Palestine  Liberation  Organization (PLO) signed an agreement that included
the  start of a plan for self-government for, and Israel's withdrawal from,
the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Israel and the PLO also agreed to try to work
out  their conflicts. Rabin, Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, and PLO
leader  Yasser  Arafat  shared  the  1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their peace
efforts. Also in 1994, talks between Rabin and King Hussein I of Jordan led
to  a  peace  treaty  ending  a  state  of war that had technically existed
between their countries since 1948.</p></pre>

Peres,  (1923-...),  a Labor Party politician, was prime minister of Israel
twice.  He  first  held  that  office  from  1984  to 1986. He became prime
minister  again  in  1995  following  the  assassination  of Prime Minister
Yitzhak  Rabin.  In  1996,  Peres  lost in national elections, and Benjamin
Netanyahu of the Likud bloc replaced him as prime minister.

In  the early and mid-1990's, both as foreign minister under Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and as prime minister himself, Peres played a major role in a
move  for  peace  between  Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO).  Peres,  Rabin,  and  PLO leader Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel
Peace Prize for their Middle East peace efforts.

Peres served as prime minister in the unity government created by the Labor
Party  and  the  Likud  bloc  in  September  1984.  The  parties formed the
government  after  no  party won a majority in the parliamentary elections.
The  unity  government  lasted  for  50 months. Under the agreement between
Labor  and  Likud, Peres (head of the Labor Party) served as prime minister
for  25  months. Yitzhak Shamir, head of Likud, was vice prime minister and
foreign  minister.  Under the agreement, the roles of Peres and Shamir were
reversed  after 25 months in October 1986. As prime minister, Peres pledged
to  withdraw  Israeli  troops that occupied Lebanon. The troops had invaded
Lebanon  in  1982. In 1985, the Israeli forces withdrew from all of Lebanon
except a Security Zone along the Israeli border.

In  1988,  Labor and Likud formed a new coalition government with Shamir as
prime  minister.  Peres  remained  as  vice  prime minister and also became
finance minister. In 1990, the coalition collapsed, and Peres resigned from
his  posts  as  vice  prime  minister and finance minister. Likud and small
parties  formed  a  new  coalition  government in June with Shamir as prime
minister.  Peres  had  become  head of the Labor Party in 1977. In 1992, he
lost that post in a party election.

Peres  was born in Vishnevo, a small town near Minsk, that was then part of
Poland  and  is now part of Belarus. His family name was Persky. He changed
the  name  to Peres in the 1940's. Peres moved with his family to Palestine
in  1934.  He  later  became  active  in  the movement that resulted in the
creation  of  the nation of Israel in Palestine in 1948. In 1950, Peres was
sent to the United States as leader of a defense ministry delegation. While
there,  he  studied  at  New  York  University  and  Harvard University. He
returned to Israel in 1952.

Peres  was  first  elected  to the Israeli Knesset (parliament) in 1959. He
helped  form  the Labor Party in 1968. He was minister of defense from 1974
to 1977. He served as foreign minister in 1987 and 1988 and from 1992 until
1995.</p></pre>

Shamir, (1915-...), served as prime minister of Israel from October 1983 to
September  1984,  and  from  October  1986 to July 1992. As prime minister,
Shamir  continued most of Israel's previously established foreign policies.
For  example,  he  supported  Jewish  settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip (territories that Israeli troops had occupied in 1967).

Shamir  succeeded Menachem Begin as prime minister in 1983, after Begin had
resigned.  He also replaced Begin as head of the political party called the
Likud bloc. Shamir had been foreign minister since 1980.

In  July  1984, parliamentary elections were held in Israel. No party won a
majority.  In  September, the Likud bloc and the Labor Party formed a unity
government that lasted for 50 months. Under the unity government agreement,
Shimon  Peres,  leader  of the Labor Party, served as prime minister for 25
months.  Shamir  served  as vice prime minister and foreign minister. Under
the  agreement, the roles of Peres and Shamir were reversed after 25 months
in  October  1986.  In  the  elections  of  November  1988,  no party won a
majority.  In  December, Likud and Labor formed a new coalition government.
Shamir remained prime minister.

In  1987,  protests  by  Palestinians  in  the  occupied territories began.
Several  hundred Palestinians and a smaller number of Israelis were killed.
In  1990,  Shamir refused to compromise on peace plans for the territories.
The  Labor Party then left the coalition, and the government fell in March.
In  June  1990, Likud and small conservative parties formed a new coalition
government  in  Israel  with  Shamir as prime minister. The Labor Party won
control  of  the  parliament in elections held in June 1992. In July, Labor
Party  leader  Yitzhak  Rabin  replaced  Shamir  as  prime minister. Shamir
resigned as head of the Likud block in March 1993.

Shamir  was born in Ruzinoy, a village in eastern Poland. His last name was
Jazernicki.  He  later changed his name to Shamir, the Hebrew word for both
thistle  and  flint. He studied law in Warsaw before moving to Palestine in
1935  to  attend  Hebrew  University. He dropped out in 1937 and joined the
Irgun  Zvai  Leumi, an underground Jewish terrorist militia that fought the
British (who then ruled Palestine) and the Palestinian Arabs.

In  1940,  Shamir  joined  the  more  radical Lohamei Herut Yisrael (Israel
Freedom  Fighters), or Stern Gang, terrorist militia. Israel was created in
Palestine  in  1948.  From 1955 to 1965, Shamir worked for Mossad, Israel's
intelligence   agency.  He  was  first  elected  to  the  Knesset  (Israeli
parliament) in 1973.</p></pre>

Ehud  "Brug"  Barak  is  Israel's most highly decorated soldier . Barak was
born  in 1942 in Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon. He earned a bachelor's degree in
physics  and  mathematics from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a masters
degree in economic-engineering systems from Stanford University.

He  was  drafted  into the Israel Defense Forces in 1959. Barak served as a
commander  in many of Israel's wars, including the 1967 Six-Day War and the
1973  October  War.  In 1991, he became the 14th chief of the General Staff
and  was  promoted  to  the  rank of lieutenant general, the highest in the
Israeli  military.  He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and four
other citations for bravery and excellence.

A  hallmark of Barak's military career was his involvement in the political
process.  He  helped  finalize  the  1994 peace treaty with Jordan and also
played a key role in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. Barak was critical of the
Oslo  talks  but  has  argued  that  Israel should keep moving forward in a
realistic manner on the path to peace.

In 1995, Barak left the military and joined the government of Yitzhak Rabin
as  minister  of  the  interior.  Before his appointment, he was accused of
deserting  wounded  soldiers  during a secret military exercise in 1992. An
investigation exonerated him from the allegations of misconduct.

After  Rabin  was assassinated, Barak was appointed foreign minister in the
administration of Shimon Peres.

Barak was elected Labor leader in 1997, Barak's leadership solidified after
the Knesset called for early elections.</p></pre>
