The Wye Memorandum
------------------
23-Oct-1998
-----------

"The  following  are  steps to facilitate implementation of the
Interim  Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip of September
28,  1995  and  other related agreements including the Note for
the Record of January 17, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as "the
prior  agreements")  so  that the Israeli and Palestinian sides
can    more    effectively    carry    out   their   reciprocal
responsibilities,   including   those   relating   to   further
redeployments and security, respectively. These steps are to be
carried  out  in  a parallel phased approach in accordance with
the  Memorandum and the attached time line. They are subject to
the  relevant  terms and conditions of the prior agreements and
do not supersede their other requirements.


I. FURTHER REDEPLOYMENTS
------------------------

A. Phase One and Two Further Redeployments

1. Pursuant to the Interim Agreement and subsequent agreements,
the  Israeli  side's  implementation  of  the  first and second
F.R.D.  will consist of the transfer to the Palestinian side of
13  percent  from  Area C as follows: 1 percent to Area (A); 12
percent to Area (B).

The  Palestinian  side  has  informed  that it will allocate an
area/areas amounting to 3 percent from the above area (B) to be
designated  as  the  Green  Areas  and/or  Nature Reserves. The
Palestinian  side  has  further  informed  that  they  will act
according  to  the  established  scientific standards, and that
therefore  there  will  be  no  changes  to the status of these
areas,  without prejudice to the rights of existing inhabitants
in these areas including Bedouins; while these standards do not
allow  new  construction  in  these  areas,  existing roads and
buildings may be maintained.

The  Israeli  side  will  retain  in  these  Green Areas/Nature
Reserves the overriding security responsibility for the purpose
of protecting Israelis and confronting the threat of terrorism.
Activities  and  movements of the Palestinian Police forces may
be carried out after coordination and confirmation; the Israeli
side will respond to such requests expeditiously.

2.  As  part  of  the foregoing implementation of the first and
second F.R.D., 14.2 percent from Area (B) will become Area (A).

B. Third Phase of Further Redeployments.

With  regard  to  the  terms  of  the  Interim Agreement and of
Secretary Christopher's letters to the two sides of January 17,
1997,  relating to the further redeployment process, there will
be a committee to address this question. The United States will
be briefed regularly.


II. SECURITY
------------

In  the  provisions  on  security  arrangements  of the Interim
Agreement,  the  Palestinian  side  agreed to take all measures
necessary  in  order  to  prevent  acts of terrorism, crime and
hostilities   directed   against   the  Israeli  side,  against
individuals  falling  under  the  Israeli  side's authority and
against their property, just as the Israeli side agreed to take
all  measures  necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism,
crime and hostilities and against their property. The two sides
also  agreed  to  take  legal  measures  against  within  their
jurisdiction  and  to  prevent incitement against each other by
any   organizations,   groups   or   individuals  within  their
jurisdiction.

Both  sides  recognize  that  it is in their vital interests to
combat  terrorism  and fight violence in accord with Annex I of
the  Interim  Agreement  and the Note for the Record. They also
recognize that the struggle against terror and violence must be
comprehensive  in  that  it  deals  with terrorists, the terror
support  structure and the environment conducive to the support
of terror. It must be continuous and constant over a long-term,
in  that  there can be no pauses in the work against terrorists
and  their  structure. It must be cooperative in that no effort
can  be fully effective without Israeli-Palestinian cooperation
and  the  continuous  exchange  of  information,  concepts  and
actions.

Pursuant  to  the  prior  agreements,  the  Palestinian  side's
implementation  of  its responsibilities for security, security
cooperation,  and other issues will be as detailed below during
the time periods specified in the attached time line.

A. Security Actions

1. Outlawing and Combatting Terrorist Organizations

a.  The  Palestinian  side  will make known its policy for zero
tolerance for terror and violence against both sides.

b. A work plan developed by the Palestinian side will be shared
with   the   U.S.   and  hereafter  implementation  will  begin
immediately  to  ensure  the systematic and effective combat of
terrorist organizations and their infrastructure.

c.  In  addition  to the bilateral Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation, a U.S.-Palestinian committee will meet biweekly to
review  the  steps being taken to eliminate terrorist cells and
the  support structure that plans, finances, supplies and abets
terror. In these meetings, the Palestinian side will inform the
U.S.   fully  of  the  actions  it  has  taken  to  outlaw  all
organizations  (or wings of organizations, as appropriate) of a
military,  terrorist  or  violent  character  and their support
structure and to prevent them from operating in areas under its
jurisdiction.

d. The Palestinian side will apprehend the specific individuals
suspected  of  perpetrating acts of violence and terror for the
purpose   of   further   investigation,   and  prosecution  and
punishment  of  all  persons  involved  in acts of violence and
terror.

e.  A  U.S.-Palestinian  committee  will  meet  to  review  and
evaluate information pertinent to the decisions on prosecution,
punishment  or  other legal measures which affect the status of
individuals  suspected  of  abetting  or  perpetrating  acts of
violence or terror.

2. Prohibiting Illegal Weapons

a.   The  Palestinian  side  will  ensure  an  effective  legal
framework  is  in  place to criminalize, in conformity with the
prior  agreements, any importation, manufacturing or unlicensed
sale,  acquisition  or  possession  of  firearms, ammunition or
weapons in areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.

b.  In  addition,  the  Palestinian  side  will  establish  and
vigorously  and continuously implement a systematic program for
the  collection  and  appropriate  handling of all such illegal
items  in  accordance  with  the prior agreements. The U.S. has
agreed to assist in carrying out this program.

c.  A U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli committee will be established to
assist  and  enhance cooperation in preventing the smuggling or
other   unauthorized   introduction  of  weapons  or  explosive
materials into areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.

3. Preventing Incitement

a.  Drawing  on relevant international practice and pursuant to
Article  XXII  (1)  of  the  Interim Agreement and Note for the
Record,  the  Palestinian  side will issue a decree prohibiting
all forms of incitement to violence or terror. This decree will
be  comparable  to the existing Israeli legislation which deals
with the same subject.

b.  A U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli committee will meet on a regular
basis  to  monitor  cases of possible incitement to violence or
terror,  and  to  make  recommendations  and  reports on how to
prevent such incitement. The Israeli-Palestinian and U.S. sides
will  each  appoint  a  media  specialist,  a  law  enforcement
representative,  an  educational  specialist  and  a current or
former elected official to the committee.

B. Security Cooperation

The  two  sides  agree  that their security cooperation will be
based  on a spirit of partnership and will include, among other
things, the following steps:

1. Bilateral Cooperation

There  will be full bilateral cooperation between the two sides
which will be continuous, intensive and comprehensive.

2. Forensic Cooperation

There  will  be an exchange of forensic expertise, training and
other assistance.

3. Trilateral Committee

In  addition  to  the  bilateral  Israeli-Palestinian  security
cooperation,  a high-ranking U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli committee
will  meet  as  required  and  not less than biweekly to assess
current   threats,  deal  with  any  impediments  to  effective
security  cooperation  and  coordination  and address the steps
being  taken  to combat terror and terrorist organizations. The
committee  will  also  serve as a forum to address the issue of
external support for terror. In these meetings, the Palestinian
side  will  fully  inform  the  members of the committee of the
results  of  its  investigations  concerning terrorist suspects
already  in custody and the participants will exchange addition
relevant  information.  The  committee will report regularly to
the  leaders of the two sides on the status of cooperation, the
results of the meetings and its recommendations.

C. Other Issues

1. Palestinian Police Force

a. The Palestinian side will provide a list of its policemen to
the Israeli side in conformity with the prior agreements.

b.  Should  the  Palestinian side request technical assistance,
the U.S. has indicated its willingness to help meet these needs
in cooperation with other donors.

c.  The  Monitoring and Steering Committee will, as part of its
functions,  monitor  the  implementation  of this provision and
brief the U.S.

2. PLO Charter

The   Executive   Committee   of   the   Palestine   Liberation
Organization  and the Palestinian Central Council will reaffirm
the  letter  of 22 January 1998 from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
to  President  Clinton  concerning  the  nullification  of  the
Palestinian  National  Charter provisions that are inconsistent
with  the  letters exchanged between the PLO and the Government
of  Israel  on  9/10  September  1993. PLO Chairman Arafat, the
Speaker  of  the Palestine National Council, and the Speaker of
the  Palestinian Council will invite the members of the PNC, as
well  as  the  members of the Central Council, the Council, and
the  Palestinian  Heads  of  Ministries  to  a  meeting  to  be
addressed  by  President  Clinton to reaffirm their support for
the  peace  process  and  the  aforementioned  decisions of the
Executive Committee and the Central Council.

3. Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters

Among  other forms of legal assistance in criminal matters, the
requests  for  arrest  and  transfer of suspects and defendants
pursuant to Article II (7) of Annex IV of the Interim Agreement
will be submitted (or resubmitted) through the mechanism of the
Joint Israeli-Palestinian Legal Committee and will be responded
to  in  conformity  with  Article II (7) (f) of Annex IV of the
Interim  Agreement  within  the  twelve  week  period. Requests
submitted  after  the  eighth  week  will  be  responded  to in
conformity  with  Article II (7) (f) within four weeks of their
submission.  The U.S. has been requested by the sides to report
on  a  regular basis on the steps being taken to respond to the
above requests.

4. Human Rights and the Rule of Law

Pursuant of Article XI (1) of Annex I of the Interim Agreement,
and  without  derogating from the above, the Palestinian Police
will  exercise  powers  and  responsibilities to implement this
Memorandum with due regard to internationally accepted norms of
human  rights  and  the  rule of law, and will be guided by the
need  to  protect  the public, respect human dignity, and avoid
harassment.


III. INTERIM COMMITTEES AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
-------------------------------------------

1.  The Israeli and Palestinian sides reaffirm their commitment
to  enhancing their relationship and agree on the need actively
to  promote  economic development in the West Bank and Gaza. In
this regard, the parties agree to continue or to reactivate all
standing  committees  established  by  the  Interim  Agreement,
including  the  Monitoring  and  Steering  Committee, the Joint
Economic  Committee  (JEC),  the Civil Affairs Committee (CAC),
the Legal Committee and the Standing Cooperation Committee.

2.   The   Israeli   and   Palestinian  sides  have  agreed  on
arrangements  which  will permit the timely opening of the Gaza
Industrial   Estate.  They  also  have  concluded  a  "Protocol
Regarding  the Establishment and Operation of the International
Airport in the Gaza Strip During the Interim Period."

3.  Both  sides  will  renew  negotiations  on the Safe Passage
immediately. As regards the southern route, the sides will make
best  efforts  to  conclude  the agreement within a week of the
entry  into force of this Memorandum. Operation of the southern
route will start as soon as possible thereafter. As regards the
northern  route,  negotiations  will  continue with the goal of
reaching  agreement  as  soon  as possible. Implementation will
take place expeditiously thereafter.

4.  The  Israeli  and  Palestinian  sides acknowledge the great
importance  of  the  Port  of  Gaza  for the development of the
Palestinian  economy,  and  the expansion of Palestinian trade.
They  commit themselves to proceeding without delay to conclude
an  agreement  to  allow  the construction and operation of the
port   in   accordance   with   the   prior   agreements.   The
Israeli-Palestinian   Committee   will   reactivate   its  work
immediately with a goal of concluding the protocol within sixty
days,  which will allow commencement of the construction of the
port.

5.  The  two  sides  recognize  that  unresolved  legal  issues
adversely affect the relationship between the two peoples. They
therefore  will  accelerate efforts through the Legal Committee
to  address outstanding legal issues and to implement solutions
to   these   issues   in  the  shortest  possible  period.  The
Palestinian side will provide to the Israeli side copies of all
of its laws in effect.

6.  The  Israeli  and  Palestinian  sides  also  will  launch a
strategic   economic   dialogue   to   enhance  their  economic
relationship.  They  will establish within the framework of the
JEC  an  Ad  Hoc Committee for this purpose. The committee will
review  the  following four issues: (1) Israeli purchase taxes;
(2)  cooperation  in  combating vehicle theft; (3) dealing with
unpaid  Palestinian  debts;  and  (4)  the  impact  of  Israeli
standards  as  barriers to trade and the expansion of A1 and A2
lists. The committee will submit an interim report within three
weeks  of  entry  into force of this Memorandum, and within six
weeks  will  submit  its  conclusions and recommendations to be
implemented.

7.   The  two  sides  agree  on  the  importance  of  continued
international  donor assistance to facilitate implementation by
both  sides of agreements reached. They also recognize the need
for enhanced donor support for economic development in the West
Bank  and  Gaza.  They  agree  to  jointly  approach  the donor
community  to  organize a Ministerial Conference before the end
of 1998 to seek pledges of enhanced levels of assistance.


IV. PERMANENT STATUS NEGOTIATIONS
---------------------------------

The   two   sides  will  immediately  resume  permanent  status
negotiations on an accelerated basis and will make a determined
effort  to  achieve the mutual goal of reaching an agreement by
May  4,  1999.  The negotiations will be continuous and without
interruption.   The  U.S.  has  expressed  its  willingness  to
facilitate these negotiations.


V. UNILATERAL ACTIONS
---------------------

Recognizing  the necessity to create a positive environment for
the  negotiations, neither side shall initiate or take any step
that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
in accordance with the interim Agreement.

This Memorandum will enter into force ten days from the date of
signature.

Done at Washington D.C. this 23rd day of October 1998.
