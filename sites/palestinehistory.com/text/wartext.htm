<pre><p align=center>First Arab-Israeli War , 15 May 1948
------------------------------------

Arab  opposition  to  an  Israeli state began after the Balfour Declaration
1917,  which supported the idea of a Jewish national homeland. In the 1920s
there  were  anti-Zionist  riots  in  Palestine,  after the British mandate
government  allowed  thousands  of  Jews to immigrate to Palestine from all
over the world.

In  1936  an Arab revolt led to a British royal commission that recommended
partition (approved by United Nations 1947), but rejected by the Arabs.

When  it became clear that the British intended to leave by May 15, leaders
of  the  Yishuv  decided  (as  they  claim)  to  implement that part of the
partition  plan calling for establishment of a Jewish state. In Tel Aviv on
May  14  the  Provisional  State  Council,  formerly  the National Council,
"representing  the  Jewish  people  in  Palestine  and  the  World  Zionist
Movement,"  proclaimed the "establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine,
to be called Medinat Israel (the State of Israel) … open to the immigration
of Jews from all the countries of their dispersion."

On  May  15  the armies of Egypt, Transjordan (now Jordan), Syria, Lebanon,
and Iraq joined Palestinian and other Arab guerrillas who had been fighting
Jewish  forces  since  November  1947.  The war now became an international
conflict, the first Arab-Israeli War.

The  Arabs  failed  to prevent establishment of a Jewish state, and the war
ended  with four UN-arranged armistice agreements between Israel and Egypt,
Lebanon,  Jordan,  and  Syria.  The  frontiers  defined  in  the  armistice
agreements  remained  until  they were altered by Israel's conquests during
the Six-Day War in 1967.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>Suez campaign , 29 Oct - 4 Nov 1956
-----------------------------------

During  the  1950s there was considerable tension between Israel and Egypt,
which,  under  President Nasser, had become a leader in the Arab world. His
nationalization  of  the Suez Canal 1956 provided an opportunity for Israel
with  Britain  and  France,  to attack Egypt and occupy a part of Palestine
that  Egypt  had  controlled since 1949, the Gaza Strip , from which Israel
was forced by UN and US pressure to withdraw 1957 .

Great  Britain  and  France  ostensibly  joined the attack because of their
dispute   with   Egypt's   president  Gamal  Abdel  Nasser,  who  had  just
nationalized the Suez Canal. Nasser took over the canal after Great Britain
and  France  withdrew  offers to finance the construction of the Aswân High
Dam.  Israel  scored  a quick victory, seizing the Gaza Strip and the Sinai
Peninsula  within  a  few  days. As Israeli forces reached the banks of the
Suez Canal, the British and French started their attack.

The  fighting  was  halted  by  the UN after a few days, and a UN Emergency
Force  (UNEF)  was sent to supervise the cease-fire in the Canal zone. In a
rare  instance  of  cooperation,  the  United  States  and the Soviet Union
supported  the  UN resolution forcing the three invading countries to leave
Egypt  and  Gaza.  By the end of the year their forces withdrew from Egypt,
but  Israel  refused  to  leave  Gaza  until early 1957, and only after the
United  States  had  promised  to  help  resolve  the conflict and keep the
Straits of Tiran open.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>Six-Days war , 5-10 June 1967
-----------------------------

After  the  Suez-Sinai  war Arab nationalism increased dramatically, as did
demands  for  revenge  led  by Egypt's president Nasser. The formation of a
united Arab military command that massed troops along the borders, together
with  Egypt's  closing  of  the Straits of Tiran and Nasser's insistence in
1967  that  the  UNEF  leave Egypt, led Israel to attack Egypt, Jordan, and
Syria  simultaneously  on June 5 of that year. The war ended six days later
with  an  Israeli victory. Israel's French-equipped air force wiped out the
air  power  of  its  antagonists  and  was  the  chief  instrument  in  the
destruction of the Arab armies.

The  Six-Day War left Israel in possession of Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula,
which  it  took from Egypt; Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which it
took  from  Jordan;  and  the  Golan  Heights, taken from Syria. Land under
Israel's  jurisdiction  after the 1967 war was about four times the size of
the  area  within  its  1949  armistice frontiers. The occupied territories
included an Arab population of about 1.5 million.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>October War , 6-24 Oct 1973
---------------------------

In  1973  Egypt  joined  Syria in a war on Israel to regain the territories
lost  in  1967. The two Arab states struck unexpectedly on October 6, which
fell on Yom Kippur , Israel's holiest fast day .

After  crossing  the  swise  channel the Arab forces gain a lot of advanced
positions  in  Sinai  Peninsula  and Golan Heights and manage to defeat the
Israeli forces for more then three weeks .

Israeli forces with a massive U.S. economic and military assistance managed
to  stop  the  arab  forces after a three-week struggle and defeat with the
cost  of many casualties,and the Arabs strong showing won them support from
the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics (USSR) and most of the world's
developing countries.

Israel,  forced  to  compete  with the nearly unlimited Arab resources, was
faced  with  a  serious  financial  setback. Only massive U.S. economic and
military  assistance  enabled  it to redress the balance, but even American
aid was unable to prevent a downward spiral of the economy.

In  an  effort  to  encourage a peace settlement, U.S. President Richard M.
Nixon  charged  his  secretary  of state, Henry Kissinger, with the task of
negotiating  agreements  between  Israel  and  Egypt  and  Syria. Kissinger
managed to work out military disengagements between Israel and Egypt in the
Sinai and between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights during 1974.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>Lebanon invasion , 1982
-----------------------

From  1978  the  presence  of Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon led to Arab
raids on Israel and Israeli retaliatory incursions .

On 6June 1982 Israel launched a full-scale invasion . By 14 June Beirut was
encircled  , Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Syrian forces were
evacuated mainly to Syria 21-31 Aug.

In  Feb  1985  there  was  a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the country
without any gain or losses incurred . Israel maintains a ‘security zone’ in
S  Lebanon and supports the South Lebanese Army militia as a buffer against
Palestinian guerrilla incursions.

Israel's  alleged  complicity in massacres in two Palestinian refugee camps
increased  Arab  hostility.  Talks between Israel and Lebanon , between Dec
1982  and  May 1983, resulted in an agreement , drawn up by US secretary of
state  George Shultz, calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from
Lebanon  within  three months. Syria refused to acknowledge the agreement ,
and  left  some 30,000 troops, with about 7,000 PLO members, in northeast ,
Israel retaliated by refusing to withdraw its forces from the south.

Meanwhile  the  problems in Lebanon continued. In 1984, under pressure from
Syria, President Gemayel of Lebanon abrogated the 1983 treaty with Israel ,
but  the  government  of  national  unity in Tel Aviv continued to plan the
withdrawal  of  its forces, although it might lead to outright civil war in
Lebanon.  Guerrilla  groups  of the Shi'ite community of south Lebanon took
advantage  of  the  situation  by  attacking the departing Israeli troops .
Israel  retaliated  by  attacking Shi'ite villages . Most of the withdrawal
was complete by June 1985.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>Intifada , 1987 - 1991
----------------------

Prime  Minister  Peres  met King Hussein of Jordan secretly in the south of
France  1985,  later,  in a speech to the UN , Peres said he would not rule
out the possibility of an international conference on the Middle East . PLO
leader  Yasser  Arafat  also  had  talks  with  Hussein and later,in Cairo,
renounced  PLO  guerrilla  activity outside Israeli-occupied territory . In
Israel  ,  government  of  national  unity was having some success with its
economic  policies  ,  inflation  falling in 1986 to manageable levels, but
from  1987  it  was  faced  with  an  organized Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories, the Intifada.

Relations  between  Israel  and the Palestinians entered a new phase in the
late  1987  with  the  intifada,  a  series  of  uprisings  in the occupied
territories   that  included  demonstrations,  strikes,  and  rock-throwing
attacks  on Israeli soldiers . The harsh response by the Israeli government
drew criticism from both the United States and the UN.

The uprising began Dec 1987 in the Gaza Strip. Rumours that a fatal traffic
collision had been caused by Israeli security service agents in retaliation
for  the  stabbing of an Israeli the previous week led to demonstrations by
teenagers  armed  with slingshots. It subsequently spread, despite attempts
at  repression.  Some 1,300 Palestinians and 80 Israelis were killed in the
uprising  up  to  the  end  of  1991.  Many  Palestinian private homes were
dynamited by military order.</p></pre>
