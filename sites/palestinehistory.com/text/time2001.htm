04.01.2001  -  Armed with qualified acceptance by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat,  President  Clinton  worked to reconcile differences on his outline
for  a negotiated settlement between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak.  The  new  momentum stemmed from two White House meetings Tuesday in
which  Arafat  "accepted  with  his  interpretations  and  principles"  the
president's  framework  for  an  accord, said Hassan Abdel Rahman. "What we
have  to  do  now  is work with both sides to see if we can reconcile those
reservations," White House spokesman Jake Siewert said after Clinton talked
by  telephone  to  Barak  and  Arafat.  The call to Barak evidently was not
conclusive. An Israeli diplomat said the prime minister intended to consult
with  senior  members  of  his Cabinet and then speak again to Clinton. The
diplomat  said  it  was  essential  for  Israel  that  Arafat implement his
commitment to the president to curb violence in the region.

12.01.2001  -  After  a  round  of  high-level  peace  talks,  Israeli  and
Palestinian  negotiators lowered expectations Friday, saying gaps remain so
wide  that it will take a miracle to strike a deal before President Clinton
leaves  office.  However,  both sides said they are willing to keep trying,
and agreed to meet again Saturday evening, possibly with Palestinian leader
Yasser  Arafat  and  former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres leading the
teams.

29.01.2001  -  Prime Minister Ehud Barak ruled out any contacts with Yasser
Arafat  before  Israel's Feb. 6 election and accused the Palestinian leader
of  an  unleashing  an  "attack of lies" against Israel. In the Gaza Strip,
Israel  soldiers  shot  and killed a Palestinian man who was working on his
home.  The  Israel attacks follows the round of peace talks in Taba, Egypt,
which ended Saturday without any agreement. A total of 330 Palestinian have
been killed since September 2000.</p></pre>

07.02.2001  -  Ariel  Sharon  will  have  precious little time to savor his
lopsided  election  victory  as  prime  minister.  He  must quickly forge a
government  from  the  unruly  factions in parliament, and he faces hostile
Palestinians  deeply  suspicious of his intentions. Sharon routed incumbent
Ehud  Barak  in  one  of  the most one-sided elections in Israel's history,
winning  62.5% to 37.4%. The day after the balloting, attention was already
focused  on  whether  Sharon  would  be  able  to  stitch together a stable
coalition government.

13.02.2001  - Israeli helicopter gunships unleashed a fatal pinpoint strike
on  a  car  carrying  a  Palestinian security agent as the man drove on the
outskirts  of  a refugee camp. The slain Palestinian officer was identified
as  Massoud  Ayyad,  54, a major in Force 17, an elite Palestinian security
service.  The  missile attack on the outskirts of the Jebaliya refugee camp
killed  Ayyad  instantly and turned his car into a smoldering, twisted pile
of metal. Four bystanders were lightly injured.

21.02.2001  -  Israel's  targeted  killings  of  Palestinians  suspected of
attacks  on  Israelis  are  part of a "policy of state assassinations," the
human  rights  groups  Amnesty  International  said  in  a  report released
Wednesday.  The  group demanded that Israel stop the practice and asked the
United  States to review its weapons sales to Israel as a result of it. The
report  said  Amnesty  field  workers  investigated  several cases in which
Israeli  forces targeted and killed Palestinian leaders, and concluded that
the killings were illegal and unnecessary. The report called the killings a
"policy  of  state  assassination." Amnesty International, the London-based
group  that  won  the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its human rights advocacy,
called  on  the United States to examine "all arms transfers to Israel" and
provide guarantees that the weapons "are not used to violate human rights."</p></pre>

16.03.2001 - For the second time in three months, Palestinians are pressing
the  U.N.  Security  Council  to  send  a  security  force into Palestinian
occupied  territories, despite staunch objection from Israel and the United
States. A similar proposal was voted down in December, but Palestinian U.N.
envoy  Nasser  Al-Kidwa  insisted that things are different now because the
situation  in  the  territories  has  deteriorated,  the  U.S.  and Israeli
governments  have changed and the Security Council has five new members. He
wants  a  new  vote  next  week. The December resolution was defeated after
intensive  lobbying  by  the  United  States,  Israel's strongest ally. The
Palestinians  and their supporters couldn't muster the necessary nine votes
in the 15-member council. Al-Kidwa predicted success in a new vote, but any
move  toward creating such a force still could face possible defeat because
the  United States - which has veto power - remains opposed to any proposal
Israel objects to.

23.03.2001  -  A  21-year-old  Palestinian security officer was killed when
Israeli forces fired tank shells at a position of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's  presidential  guard  unit.  Four  others  were injured. Since the
unrest began six months ago, 355 Palestinians have been killed.

28.03.2001  -  Israeli helicopters rocketed Palestinian police buildings in
Gaza  and  the  West  Bank town of Ramallah on Wednesday. Flares lit up the
night  sky  over  Ramallah  during the assault. Helicopter gunships hit the
Ramallah headquarters of Force 17, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's elite
guard. Five gunships fired on Force 17 headquarters in Deir al-Balah in the
southern  Gaza  Strip. Israeli ships off the coast of Gaza City opened fire
on  the  area of Arafat's office. The buildings under attack - all in areas
governed  by  Arafat's Palestinian Authority - had been evacuated after the
Israeli military warned the Palestinians to leave.</p></pre>

02.04.2001  -  In  the  West Bank town of Bethlehem, Palestinian gunmen and
Israeli  soldiers  exchanged heavy fire, and there were unconfirmed reports
of  casualties.  The loud booms could be heard in downtown Jerusalem, a few
miles away. In Rafah, the Israeli rocket attack killed 29-year-old Mohammed
Abdallah,  a  member of Jihad group, and turned his truck into a smoldering
pile  of  metal.  In  a  quick  burial,  more  than  2,000 mourners shouted
"revenge,  revenge,"  as  they  marched  behind  the  body, draped in a red
blanket.

10.04.2001 - Israel rocketed Palestinian security targets in the Gaza Strip
on  Tuesday, killing a Palestinian police doctor and injuring 20 people. It
was  the  first  daytime  attack  by Israel in months. Israel's air strikes
usually come at night, when Palestinian buildings being targeted are empty.
Palestinian Brig. Gen. Abdel Razek Majaida said the Israeli rocketing was a
"declaration  of  war."  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel Sharon said he was
implementing  a detailed plan aimed at restoring a sense of security to the
Israeli people.

19.04.2001  -  Israeli  tanks  and bulldozers re-entered the Gaza strip and
leveled  a  Palestinian  police  station  ,  a  day after the United States
rebuked  the  Israelis  for  seizing another area of the Gaza strip. Israel
withdrew  from  the  other  Palestinian-controlled area on Tuesday, after a
stinging  criticism  by  U.S.  Secretary of State Colin Powell. Palestinian
security  officials  said  Israeli  tanks  and army bulldozers on Wednesday
entered  an  area  of  the  Gaza Strip near the Egyptian border, stayed for
about  45  minutes  and destroyed a police station. There were no immediate
reports   of  injuries.  Since  the  violence  erupted  on  Sept.  28,  392
Palestinian have been killed.</p></pre>

07.05.2001  -  Israeli  troops  shelled  a Palestinian refugee camp Monday,
killing a 4-month-old baby girl and wounding 24 people. Palestinian doctors
said  10  children  were  among  the  injured. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon  said  he  was sorry, and that Israeli troops did not intend to harm
children.  In the West Bank, Israeli troops briefly entered two Palestinian
towns  -  part of a new policy that gives field commanders the authority to
decide on such forays on the spot, without waiting for government approval.
Israeli  shelling during one of the raids killed a Palestinian teacher. The
United States has sharply criticized such incursions.

14.05.2001  -  Five  Palestinian policemen manning a roadside checkpoint in
the West Bank were killed by Israeli fire, and Israeli helicopters rocketed
Palestinian  security  targets  in Gaza, destroying 10 armored vehicles. In
Gaza,  two  Palestinians  were  killed  in  a  clash  with  Israeli forces.
Thousands  of  Palestinians chanting "revenge" gathered outside a West Bank
hospital  for  a  memorial procession for the slain policemen. The officers
were  killed  at a small Palestinian police outpost near the West Bank town
of  Beituniya, Palestinian officials said. Several bullets tore through the
barrack  walls.  Also,  the  Israeli  army  demolished a Palestinian police
station and several other buildings in the West Bank village of Shuwakeh in
an  area under Israeli security control. More than seven months of violence
has killed 447 Palestinian.

31.05.2001  - Faisal Husseini, a top PLO official who had a leading role in
the  launching  of  the  peace  process  with  Israel  and  was  a longtime
campaigner  for Palestinian claims in Jerusalem, died of a heart attack. He
was  60.  Husseini,  the  main PLO official in Jerusalem, died in his hotel
room  before  dawn,  said  an  organizer of a conference where Husseini was
scheduled  to  speak  later.  "He  has been my colleague since we were very
young.  He's  also  my  relative.  It  is really a great loss," Palestinian
leader  Yasser  Arafat  said  in Brussels, Belgium, where he decided to cut
short a visit to fly back to the region to attend to Husseini's body.</p></pre>

13.06.2001  -  CIA  chief  George Tenet brought together senior Israeli and
Palestinian  security officials to begin implementing a U.S.-brokered truce
the  two  sides  have accepted. Israel said it considered the truce to have
taken  effect with the end of the three-way meeting, at 3 p.m., and Israeli
media  said  the  two sides would begin carrying out some of the cease-fire
provisions  in  the next 48 hours. However, Palestinian officials described
the  meeting  as  a failure, saying the Israelis did not commit to specific
steps, such as easing a security closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

22.06.2001  -  Two Israeli soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Gaza
Strip  on Friday, lured toward a booby-trapped jeep by Palestinians calling
for help, the army said. Elsewhere in Gaza, two Palestinian teen-agers were
critically  wounded  by  Israeli  fire.  The  attacks came as a senior U.S.
envoy, William Burns, met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to try
to cement a fragile cease-fire.

26.06.2001  -  Inviting  himself to the White House, Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel  Sharon  was  hoping  for talk of unity at the expense of Palestinian
leader  Yasser  Arafat.  Instead,  Sharon  wound  up  his  Washington visit
Wednesday  after  a cold shower of public disagreement with President Bush.
Sharon  and  Bush  clashed  in  public  over  how much reduction in Mideast
violence  would  be  enough  to  trigger  further political moves. And in a
closed  meeting  they  disagreed  over  the  explosive  issue  of  freezing
construction  in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. "There
must be a total cessation of violence" before any negotiations, Sharon said
at   every   opportunity,  even  correcting  a  reporter  who  asked  about
"cessation."  Bush  made  it  clear from the outset that his administration
does not share the all-or-nothing Israeli view.</p></pre>

09.07.2001  - Bulldozers leveled 14 Palestinian homes under construction in
one of Israel's biggest demolition operations in years, provoking tears and
stone-throwing  at  a  refugee  camp on the northern edge of Jerusalem. The
Palestinians  said  the  demolitions  were  part  of  an  Israeli effort to
restrict their numbers in and around Jerusalem.

11.07.2001  -  A  Palestinian  woman  in  labor  was barred from passing an
Israeli  military  checkpoint for 2 1/2 hours, giving birth in her car to a
baby  boy  who  died  before reaching a medical clinic, her doctor said. In
another  checkpoint  confrontation,  an  Israeli  soldier shot and killed a
Palestinian  woman after her taxi evaded a roadblock trying to take workers
to jobs inside Israel.

17.07.2001 - Two Israeli helicopters fired missiles at a Palestinian farm ,
killing  four  people, including two senior Hamas activists. The helicopter
attack  obliterated  a  farm building near the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
Palestinian  security sources identified two of the dead as Omar Saadeh and
Taha Aruj, another of the dead was a cousin of Saadeh.

25.07.2001 - Israel's army fired missiles from a hillside position, killing
a  activist  from  Hamas  as  he  drove  his  car  in a West Bank town. The
activist,  Saleh  Darwazeh, 38, was alone in his red Volkswagen when it was
hit  by  five  rounds in Nablus. The car was destroyed in the attack, which
sent  black  plumes  of  smoke rising over the town. Palestinian ambulances
rushed to the scene and recovered the body, which was torn to pieces by the
force of the blast.

30.07.2001  -  An  explosion  ripped  through a car parts store in the West
Bank,  killing  six  Palestinian  activists  in one of the deadliest single
episodes  in  10  months  of  Intifada.  Hours  later,  Israeli helicopters
rocketed  the  Palestinian  police  headquarters in Gaza City, injuring two
policemen.  The  helicopter  strike sent white smoke rising from the police
compound  as people ran frantically from the buildings into the street. The
first  clashes in the current Intifada broke out at the site Sept. 29 - the
day  after  a controversial visit by Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister,
who  was  opposition  leader at the time. Since then, 539 Palestinians have
been killed by the Israeli army.</p></pre>

15.08.2001  -  About  70 tanks and hundreds of troops took over Palestinian
government buildings, including the governor's office and police buildings.
The  tanks withdrew after three hours. There were at least three deaths and
several  injuries.  Eyewitnesses  say Israeli bulldozers demolished several
police  checkpoints  and  Israeli  snipers  are engaged in a firefight with
Palestinian police.

16.08.2001  -  Israeli undercover troops killed a Palestinian leader in the
town  of  Hebron. Imad Abu Sneineh was shot in the head, chest, stomach and
legs  by  10  bullets  fired  from  a  truck with Palestinian number plates
outside  his home in the divided West Bank city of Hebron. Israeli security
sources said the killing was carried out by undercover soldiers.

23.08.2001 - Israeli soldiers shot dead four Palestinians in the West Bank,
hours  after the two sides said they were ready to hold new talks on ending
nearly  11  months of bloodshed. Palestinian official said, three civilians
were  shot  dead  as  they  came to the aid of a man who was wounded by the
soldiers and later died. The official described it as a "massacre."

28.08.2001  -  Israel assassinated the leader of a Palestinian faction in a
missile  strike  on  the group's offices in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
Abu  Ali  Mustafa,  the  64-year-old  head  of  the  Popular  Front for the
Liberation  of Palestine (PFLP), died when two missiles fired by helicopter
gunships  slammed  into  the  offices in an apartment block after he took a
phone call. Mustafa had the highest profile of anyone killed under Israel's
policy  of  tracking  and  killing  militants  since a Palestinian uprising
erupted  in  September.  He  became PFLP chief after longtime leader George
Habash  stepped  down  in  July  2000.  The helicopter gunships had hovered
overhead  before  firing  the missiles through the window. The Israeli army
confirmed it had launched an attack against Mustafa.</p></pre>

07.09.2001  - An Israeli helicopter fired two missiles at a Palestinian car
in Tulkarm, killing two Fatah activists and injuring two others. Three more
bystanders were slightly injured in the missile attack, in another targeted
killing by Israel of Palestinian activists.

13.09.2001  -  Palestinian  President  Yasser  Arafat donated blood for the
victims of the terror attacks in New York and Washington. "God bless them,"
Arafat  said  as  medical  staff  prepared  to draw his blood in Gaza Shifa
hospital.  Palestinian  officials said his donation would be the start of a
blood drive for the casualties of the 11'th of September attacks.

16.09.2001  - Israeli tanks rumbled into Palestinian towns in the West Bank
for  the  second straight day. The Israeli incursion into Jericho and Jenin
ignited  gun  battles  that  left  three  Palestinian militants dead and 21
wounded.  A  fourth  Palestinian militant died from injuries sustained in a
raid  overnight  Wednesday  in  Jenin  and two nearby villages. Palestinian
leaders  accused  Israel  of stepping up incursions into their territory as
the  world  turned  its  eyes  toward  the horrendous aftermath of the U.S.
terror attacks.

27.09.2001   -  Israeli  Foreign  Minister  Shimon  Peres  and  Palestinian
President  Yasser  Arafat  agreed on Wednesday to make a new bid to forge a
lasting  truce that could boost U.S. efforts to create a global anti-terror
coalition.  Meeting  under  U.S.  pressure,  the  leaders  reiterated their
commitment  to a truce-to-talks plan that allows for measures including the
lifting  of  blockades  imposed on Palestinian areas. Peres and Arafat also
agreed at the talks at Gaza airport to hold a second meeting "within a week
or  so"  to turn a shaky truce into a lasting cease-fire. Even as they met,
Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian teen-ager in the Gaza Strip.</p></pre>

08.10.2001  - Israeli tanks and troops drove into a Palestinian area of the
West Bank city of Hebron on Friday, seizing strategic positions and killing
five  Palestinians  in  a  gun battle. Sharon said U.S. efforts to win Arab
support  for  a  war on terrorism after the suicide attacks on New York and
Washington  would not stop Israel defending itself and he warned the United
States not to "appease" the Arabs at the Jewish state's expense.

17.10.2001  -  Israeli  Minister of Tourism Rehavim Ze'evi died after being
gunned  down at close range outside his Jerusalem hotel room, apparently by
Palestinians  seeking  revenge  for Israel's assassination of a Palestinian
leader.  Ariel  Sharon promptly ordered a freeze on all diplomatic contacts
with  the  Palestinians,  and  placed full responsibility for the murder on
Palestinian  President  Yassir  Arafat.  The  Israeli security cabinet also
decided  to  step  up  its  military  operations  against  the  Palestinian
Authority  and  to  cancel  moves  taken  earlier this week to ease Israeli
sanctions against the Palestinians in the West bank and Gaza Strip.

24.10.2001  -  Israeli  soldiers  killed  at  least fifteen Palestinians in
overnight  and  early  morning  fighting,  in  the  bloodiest day since the
Palestinian  uprising erupted thirteen months ago. The Israeli actions come
despite  reports that Israeli troops will soon end their crippling siege of
six  Palestinian  cities  in the West Bank, following massive international
pressure.  Responding  to  U.S.  demands for an immediate withdrawal, Ariel
Sharon  told  the Israeli Knesset the army would stay until it achieved its
mission, which he defined as "avoiding terrorism and arresting terrorists."

25.10.2001  -  Israeli  troops  withdrew from the West Bank village of Beit
Reema after a deadly raid which was a large scale massacre killing at least
13  Palestinian and injuring more then 20 others. Israeli forces pulled out
of  Beit  Reema  before  sunrise  after  a  massive air, armor and infantry
operation.</p></pre>
