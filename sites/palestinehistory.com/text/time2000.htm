04.01.2000  , Palestinian officials say they have reached an agreement with
Israel  under  which  a long-delayed transfer of Israeli-occupied West Bank
land  to  Palestinian  control  will  be implemented in the next 48 hours ,
according to Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.

14.01.2000  ,  Israeli  Attorney  General  Elyakim Rubinstein is reportedly
conducting an assessment of possible charges against Israeli President Ezer
Weizman. Weizman is suspected of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars
in gifts between 1988 and 1993 without reporting the gifts to authorities.

20.01.2000 , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in Washington this
morning for a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.

27.01.2000  ,  In the first taint of scandal to touch his government, Prime
Minister  Ehud  Barak's  party  was fined $3.2 million for campaign finance
violations,  and  the  attorney  general  said  it  was  opening a criminal
investigation.  Barak  said  he  hadn't known of any illegal practices, and
asserted  that  the  campaign-finance  law  was  unclear.  After  the state
comptroller,  Eliezer  Goldberg,  imposed  the fine, the office of Attorney
General  Elyakim  Rubinstein said "there are grounds to instruct the police
to  open  an  investigation"  of  the  matter.  The probe will include past
campaign-finance  practices  by other parties as well, the Justice Ministry
said.  Barak  said that he "honored" the comptroller's report, but said "in
light of the large fine" the party was considering appealing to the Supreme
Court.</p></pre>

02.02.2000  -  In  the  latest  round of peace talks, the Palestinians have
flatly  rejected  an  Israeli  map that would keep large chunks of the West
Bank under Israeli control. Tayyeb Abdel Rahim confirmed for the first time
that  Israel  submitted a map delineating proposed future borders. Israel's
plan  would  annex swaths of land on the eastern and western fringes of the
West  Bank,  as  well as settlement blocs, Abdel Rahim said. Israel and the
Palestinians are less than two weeks away from a deadline for agreeing on a
peace  treaty outline, but little progress has been made in three months of
negotiations.

03.02.2000  -  Israeli  Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President
Yasser   Arafat   held   talks   this   morning   concerning   a  framework
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.

07.02.2000  -  Israeli  warplanes  attacked  three  power  stations  and  a
Hezbollah  guerrilla stronghold in Lebanon. The move was in response to the
recent killing of four Israeli army officers .

09.02.2000  -  An  Israeli  government  report  published acknowledged what
Palestinians  and  human  rights  groups  have said for years - that Israel
systematically  used  illegal force against Palestinian suspects during the
intefadeh.  The State Comptroller's report, written in 1997 but withheld by
the  government  until  now, said Shin Bet security agents who interrogated
suspects  also  systematically  lied about their actions to their superiors
and to the courts. The report covers the years 1988-92, when the intefadeh,
or  Palestinian  uprising  against Israel, was at its height. Unprecedented
numbers of Palestinians were being arrested and interrogated

21.02.2000  -  Palestinian  officials urged U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to apply
pressure on Israel to restart the stalled Mid-East peace process.</p></pre>

21.03.2000  -  Kissing  Palestinian  earth  and  warmly  welcomed by Yasser
Arafat, Pope John Paul II made a prayerful pilgrimage to the town of Jesus'
birth  that  also provided a powerful boost to Palestinian statehood hopes.
In  a  momentous  day  marred  by rock throwing after he left a Palestinian
refugee  camp,  the  79-year-old  pope celebrated an open-air mass before a
crowd  of  thousands  in Bethlehem's Manger Square and sank to his knees in
prayer  in  the  dim grotto where Christian tradition says Christ was born.
Amid  tight  security,  the  atmosphere  was  peaceful  at  all  the pope's
appearances.  But in a graphic display of frustration and volatility in the
Palestinian lands, several hundred youths at the Dheisheh camp - apparently
angry  over heavy-handed treatment by Palestinian security forces - engaged
in  a  rock-throwing clash with police just over an hour after the pope had
finished his visit there.

24.03.2000  -  Israel  and  the  Palestinian  Authority are extending their
inconclusive talks into next week, still "brainstorming" over the future of
Jerusalem,  Palestinian  aspirations  for  a state and other knotty issues.
"It's  too  early  to  know  if  this  will lead to anything," Hassan Abdel
Rahman,  the  chief  PLO  representative  in  Washington,  said. An Israeli
official,  meanwhile,  said  the  "chemistry"  was good at the screened-off
talks  at  Bolling  Air  Force Base in southeast Washington. After Friday's
meetings  the  Israelis  and  Palestinians scheduled a break for the Jewish
Sabbath,  beginning  at  sundown, and plan to resume Saturday night. Rahman
said  they  would  meet  next  week,  as well. When the negotiations opened
Tuesday, about a week of talks was anticipated.

30.03.2000  - Palestinians staged marches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -
and in some cases clashed with Israeli troops - to protest the confiscation
of   Arab-owned   land   and  Jewish  settlement  expansion.  At  least  15
demonstrators  were injured. The most serious clash was in the Israeli Arab
town  of Sakhnin, where police said about 400 demonstrators broke through a
fence  surrounding  an  Israeli army base. Police fired rubber-coated steel
bullets  at  the  demonstrators,  wounding  15. The director of the Sakhnin
medical  center  said 12 were lightly wounded, two suffered head wounds and
another had a broken leg. Hundreds of protesters stoned Israeli soldiers in
two  locations outside the West Bank town of Nablus where troops fired tear
gas and rubber-coated steel bullets.</p></pre>

07.04.2000 - Israeli and Palestinian negotiators began a new round of talks
against  a  backdrop  of  an  Egyptian  warning that Israel must agree to a
Palestinian  state  in  order  to  have real peace. Negotiators convened at
Bolling  Air  Force  base  in southeast Washington, with American mediators
ready  to  intervene  later  in  the  day to push for an agreement that has
eluded  the two sides. The negotiators also met for dinner Thursday evening
at  the base, which is screened off from the public and news media. Despite
a  1979  peace  treaty, Egypt told Israel on Thursday it could not expect a
warm  peace  unless  it  consented  to  a Palestinian state and "dealt with
Jerusalem."   Egyptian   Ambassador  Nabil  Fahmy  said  Israelis  "do  not
understand the frustration Arabs feel that there is still occupation."

12.04.2000  -  In  a concession to the Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud   Barak   accepted  President  Clinton's  proposal  to  increase  U.S.
involvement  ahead  of  a May deadline for a peace treaty outline, a senior
Israeli  official  said.  Palestinian  leader Yasser Arafat complained this
week  that  the  most  recent round of U.S.-sponsored talks has not come up
with  anything  concrete. Arafat is demanding Israel agree to a Palestinian
state on the West Bank and in Gaza with part of Jerusalem as its capital. A
failure  to  meet  a  Sept.  13 deadline for a full-fledged peace agreement
could  precipitate  a  complete  breakdown  in negotiations and a return to
violence.

26.04.2000 - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said during a visit to France
that he expected European leaders, notably French President Jacques Chirac,
to  help  advance  the Middle East peace process. "His excellency President
Chirac  is  working  with  all  his  capabilities to push forward the peace
process,"  Arafat  said  in  Paris. The Palestinian leader was meeting with
Chirac  and  Prime  Minister  Lionel  Jospin  later  Wednesday.  Arafat was
visiting  France ahead of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,
which  are  due to resume on Sunday at Eilat, an Israeli resort city on the
Red Sea.</p></pre>

01.05.2000   -   A   Palestinian   state   is   already   a  fact,  and  an
Israeli-Palestinian  peace  treaty  will  simply define its limitations, an
Israeli Cabinet minister said. Haim Ramon's comments sounded a conciliatory
note  a  day  after  talks  got  off to a sour start over Jewish settlement
expansion  in the West Bank. However, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
he  would  declare  statehood  sometime  after  Sept.  13, the peace treaty
deadline,  regardless  of  whether  he had reached agreement with Israel by
then  on the terms of independence. In the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat,
negotiators  met  for  a  second  day to try to formulate a framework for a
final peace treaty. Such a framework is due by the end of the month.

04.05.2000  -  Israel  presented  a  map  of  a proposed Palestinian entity
covering  about two-thirds of the West Bank to Palestinian negotiators, who
refused  to  consider  it and broke off the session . It was the first time
Israeli negotiators outlined in detail how they envision the future borders
of  what  they  have  said would likely be a Palestinian state. Palestinian
officials,  speaking on condition of anonymity, said the entity proposed by
the Israelis on Wednesday covered about two-thirds of the West Bank and was
divided  into  several  large parcels of land that were not contiguous. The
Palestinians  want  to  establish  a state in all of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, with east Jerusalem as its capital

08.05.2000  -  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser  Arafat  failed  to  bridge  "very large gaps," making it unlikely a
peace  treaty  outline  will  be  ready  by next week's target date, summit
participants  said . Barak, meanwhile, confirmed for the first time that he
wants  to  hand  three  West  Bank suburbs of Jerusalem to full Palestinian
control,  but said he may not be able to go through with the plan for weeks
or even months because of strong opposition - including from members of his
own  coalition.  The Palestinians have been angered by Israel's proposal to
annex  one-third  of  the  West  Bank. Barak said the final borders must be
drawn  in  such  a  way  that  the  absolute majority of the 200,000 Jewish
settlers  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip  will  come  under  Israeli
sovereignty

12.05.2000  -  Palestinians demonstrated throughout the West Bank Friday to
demand  the  release  of  Israeli-held prisoners, as Israeli radio stations
reported  secret  meetings between Israel and the Palestinians in Europe. A
few  Palestinians  were injured in Bethlehem from inhaling tear gas shot by
Israeli  soldiers, Israel's army radio reported. There were also clashes in
Ramallah  and  Qalqilya. About 400 Jewish settlers also protested Friday in
the  West Bank, demanding that the Israeli army move a checkpoint that they
say  causes  security problems. No disturbances were reported, according to
the army spokesman.

15.05.2000  -  In  some  of the worst violence in years, Israeli troops and
Palestinian  police  fought  fierce  gun  battles  ,  and  at  least  three
Palestinians  were  killed  and more than 320 injured as protests swept the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told parliament
he  knew  of  at  least  four Palestinians killed, but Palestinian hospital
officials  could  not  confirm that. In one tense standoff, Israeli snipers
commandeered  a  West  Bank  hotel,  forcing  dozens  of  guests and staff,
including  nine Americans, to seek cover in the lobby. Across the West Bank
and  Gaza,  thousands  of Palestinians battled with Israeli troops, hurling
stones  and  firebombs.  The violence came despite a decision Monday by the
Israeli  Cabinet  to  transfer  three  West Bank villages near Jerusalem to
Palestinian control in a goodwill gesture.

19.05.2000  -  In  its  largest  offer so far, Israel has proposed that the
Palestinians  take  control of 90% of the West Bank. The offer was rejected
by  the  Palestinian. The offer was made and turned down during last week's
round of talks in Sweden.

24.05.2000  -  The  last  Israeli  troops and tanks rolled out of Lebanon ,
completing  a  swift  and  dramatic  pullout  from the southern zone Israel
occupied  for  nearly  two  decades.  Muslim  guerrillas swiftly moved into
territory  left  behind  by  the  Israeli  troops and their allied militia,
seizing several tanks and vehicles.</p></pre>

13.06.2000  -  With  a White House admonition that "time is short," Israeli
and  Palestinian  negotiators  are  resuming  their  sputtering talks on an
overall   settlement   that   their  governments  pledged  to  conclude  by
mid-September.  It is supposed to determine the future of Jerusalem and how
much  land  Israel  will  cede to the Palestinians for a state. Refugee and
water  problems  also were on the agenda for the talks at Andrews Air Force
Base  in  suburban  Maryland  and  at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington.
While  negotiators  at  one  site wrestle with long-range issues, the other
negotiators  will  consider  how  much land Israel will surrender in a West
Bank pullback due this month.

16.06.2000  -  After denouncing Israel's prime minister as lacking a desire
to  conclude  a  peace  accord,  Palestinian  leader Yasser Arafat met with
Israel's  chief negotiator. Shlomo Ben-Ami and Arafat talked at Andrews Air
Force  Base  in  suburban Maryland, one of the two sites of the slow-moving
negotiations   between   Israel   and  the  Palestinians.  Negotiations  in
Washington have sputtered, partly broken off by the Palestinians to protest
Israel's  refusal  to  release 250 prisoners and to agree to Arafat's terms
for a pullback this month on the West Bank.

27.06.2000  - Adopting a tough stance ahead of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's arrival, Palestinian officials said the time was not right for a
Mideast  summit and suggested that Palestinian statehood will be proclaimed
this fall with or without Israel's blessing. Albright was in a route to the
Mideast to assess prospects for a U.S. hosted summit in which Israeli Prime
Minister  Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would try to form
the  outlines  of  a  final  peace  treaty. Barak is eager to attend such a
top-level  gathering.  Arafat is reluctant to agree to a summit, saying the
gaps  are still too wide. Palestinian officials have said Arafat fears U.S.
mediators  will  side  with  Israel on many issues and he will be pressured
into concessions.</p></pre>

05.07.2000  -  In  a  high-risk  bid  to  bring  peace  to the Middle East,
President Clinton announced Israeli and Palestinian leaders would meet with
him  next  week  at  the Camp David presidential retreat to try to reach an
accord by mid-September.

13.07.2000  -  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser  Arafat  held  their first one-on-one summit talks (since the summit
started  in  11'th  July) as the two sides grappled with the "tough issues"
standing  in  the  way  of  a  peace  agreement.  The meeting last night in
Arafat's  cabin  at  the  Camp  David presidential retreat, came at the two
leaders'  initiative.  The  parties  were  grappling with tough issues that
involve  their vital interests. The most contentious issues being addressed
include the status of disputed Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish settlements in
the  West  Bank and Gaza Strip, and whether more than 2 million Palestinian
refugees will be given the right to return to homes in Israel.

19.07.2000  -  Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak was reported to have sent a
letter  to  his  summit  host  complaining  that  the Palestinians were not
negotiating  in  good  faith. Clinton sent the summit into overtime when he
delayed  a  trip to Japan for a day. As the president met Wednesday morning
with  Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat - their second talk in 12 hours -
Israel  said "it seems" that Barak had decided to stop the talks and return
home.  Since  the  summit began July 11, Clinton has been shuttling between
the two sides, trying to shepherd them toward an accord on the most painful
and divisive issues.

25.07.2000  -  The  Middle  East  peace  talks at Camp David collapsed in a
deadlock over the future of Jerusalem. Conceding failure, President Clinton
said  the  Israelis and Palestinians "couldn't get there." Clinton returned
to the White House to say that the gaps between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak  and  Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat  had  not been bridged, but
forecast   that   they   will  be  "because  I  think  the  alternative  is
unthinkable."  The  Israeli and Palestinian delegations said in a statement
they  intended  "to  continue their efforts to conclude an agreement on all
permanent  status  issues  as soon as possible." Barak and Arafat spent two
weeks  at  Camp  David  with  Clinton as the sponsor and sometimes personal
mediator in the peace talks.</p></pre>

16.08.2000  -  Israeli  soldiers  shot and killed a 70-year-old Palestinian
after  the  man  opened fire from the roof of his home. The victim, Mahmoud
Abdullah,  a  U.S.  citizen,  was critically wounded by a shot in the head.
Israeli officers kept medics away from the scene for more than an hour.

16.08.2000  -  Israel and the Palestinians resumed high-level peace talks ,
three weeks after the collapse of negotiations at Camp David.

18.08.2000  -  In  Prime Minister Ehud Barak's clearest statement yet about
Palestinian  statehood, he offered the Palestinians an independent state if
they  formally  end  their  conflict  with Israel. The remarks came as U.S.
State Department negotiator Dennis Ross began talks to see if the two sides
were ready to move toward a peace accord.

25.08.2000 - Making a case for Israeli sovereignty over all holy shrines in
Jerusalem,  Prime  Minister Ehud Barak said that under Israeli rule no harm
would  ever  come  to  the  two  major  mosques  in  the disputed city. The
Palestinians  dismissed  Barak's  assurances and said they would not sign a
peace  treaty  without being granted sovereignty over east Jerusalem, which
includes the walled Old City.</p></pre>

07.09.2000  - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has rejected U.S. compromise
proposals on Jerusalem. Sounding a similar tone, Israel Prime Minister Ehud
Barak  said  "Some of the ideas he has raised are beyond what we believe we
can  accept.  Nevertheless,  If  Chairman Arafat is ready to take Clinton's
ideas as the basis for negotiations, we will be ready to contemplate it and
to enter into such negotiations."

13.09.2000  -  Sept.  13  was  supposed to be Palestinian independence day.
Instead, a deadline for establishing a state was missed for the second time
in  16  months,  and Palestinian leaders desperately tried to maintain some
credibility by announcing gradual steps toward statehood, including general
elections.  Over the weekend, the PLO's top policy-making body, the Central
Council, decided to postpone a statehood proclamation at least until Nov.15

14.09.2000   -   The   Clinton   administration  reopened  talks  with  the
Palestinians in a bid to end a deadlock over the future of Jerusalem.

18.09.2000 - Prime Minister Ehud Barak ruled out Islamic sovereignty over a
key  Jerusalem  shrine,  closing  the  door  to  a  Palestinian  compromise
proposal.  Israeli-Palestinian  peace  talks  are  hung  up  because  of  a
sovereignty  dispute  over  the  compound  known  to  Muslims  as  al-Haram
al-Sharif  or  Noble  Sanctuary.  Barak  and  Arafat  accused each other of
intransigence and blamed each other for the deadlock.

20.09.2000  -  Israel  and  the  Palestinians resumed contacts, a day after
Israel made conflicting announcements about the fate of negotiations, first
declaring a time-out, then saying talks were back on track.

28.09.2000  -  Israeli  riot  police  fired  rubber  bullets at hundreds of
Palestinian stone-throwers at a Jerusalem holy site. The violence broke out
just  moments  after  the  leader  of  Israel's hard-line opposition, Ariel
Sharon,  entered  the  compound.  Chants  of  "Murderer,  get out" followed
Sharon.  Near  the  West  Bank  town  of  Ramallah,  about  200 Palestinian
university  students  angered  by  Sharon's  visit  threw stones at Israeli
troops  who  fired  rubber-coated  steel  bullets.  Four  Palestinians were
injured.</p></pre>

Palestinian  protesters  were  injured.  Number  of  police,  including the
Jerusalem  police  chief,  were  hurt  by  rocks during the violence in the
compound.  Tensions  have  been  running  high since the Israeli opposition
leader,  Ariel  Sharon, visited the compound to demonstrate that Israel was
in control.</p></pre>

03.10.2000  -  The death of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy killed by Israeli
fire  shocked the world. The death of the boy, Mohammed Jamal al-Durah, was
captured  by  French  television. The images of his terrifying last moments
have come to symbolize the nature of the violent confrontations of the past
few  days  and  the  use  of  live  bullets of the Israeli army against the
civilian Palestinians.

04.10.2000  -  Secretary  of State Madeleine Albright brought Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat together to try to
get  them  to  return  to "the psychology of peacemaking." Barak said talks
won't  resume until the violence ends. Albright held two rounds of separate
meetings  with  the  two  Mideast  leaders  and  then  convened a three-way
session.  Arafat  condemned  the  "virulent attacks against our people" and
said  he  would  see  Barak only if there was a guarantee that Palestinians
would  be  protected  and an inquiry was launched into violence on the West
Bank and Gaza. In weeklong strife, more than 60 Palestinian have died.

12.10.2000  -  Israeli  helicopters  rocketed  Yasser  Arafat's residential
compound,  police  stations and broadcasting centers in a swift retaliation
for the killings of two Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian mob. The violence
was  some  of  the  worst  in  the  West Bank and Gaza Strip since the 1967
Mideast  war.  One  of  the  missiles  struck  just  50 yards from Arafat's
headquarters,  with  the  Palestinian leader inside the building during the
attack.

16.10.2000  -  In an atmosphere of high tension and mistrust, Israeli Prime
Minister  Ehud  Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met warily at an
emergency summit aimed at halting bloody clashes in the Mideast. "We cannot
afford  to fail," President Clinton warned. He implored both sides "to move
beyond  blame"  after  more  than two weeks of clashes on the West Bank and
Gaza  that  left  about  100  Palestinians  dead.  The summit was hosted by
Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak, who unmistakably blamed Israel for the
violence.

21.10.2000  - Leaders from the Arab League have begun their first emergency
summit  in  four  years in a bid to form a unified response to the violence
between  Israelis  and  Palestinians.  The summit convened with Palestinian
leader  Yasser  Arafat addressing the conference as widespread anti-Israeli
demonstrations  throughout  the Arab world placed increased pressure on the
leaders to show the depth of their commitment to the Palestinian cause. The
leaders   are  expected  to  denounce  Israel  for  its  treatment  of  the
Palestinians  and  for  failing  to  complete  its promised withdrawal from
occupied land in the West Bank and Gaza.</p></pre>
