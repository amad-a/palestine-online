04.01.99  ,  Israeli  officials say two Israeli women were shot and wounded
this morning in the West Bank town of Hebron by Palestinian gunmen.

05.01.99 , The Israeli parliament yesterday granted final approval to plans
for early general elections to be held May 17.

06.01.99  ,  Former  Israeli  army  chief  Amnon Lipkin-Shahak this morning
declared  his  candidacy  for  the office of prime minister in the nation's
upcoming general elections.

A  Palestinian  carrying  what  turned out to be a toy pistol near a Jewish
enclave  in  Hebron  was shot Wednesday by Israel soldiers and died several
hours  later,  the  army said. Hebron, home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450
Jewish  settlers,  is  one  of  the tensest spots in the West Bank. The new
violence  in  Hebron  comes  at  a  time when the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process  is  on hold. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused
the Palestinians of violating the Wye River peace agreement and has said he
would  not  hand over more West Bank land, as required by the accord, until
the Palestinians meet their obligations.

11.01.99  ,  Israeli  military  officials say they intend to end a week-old
curfew in the Palestinian-controlled part of the city of Hebron.

12.01.99  ,  A  Palestinian  was  seriously  wounded  in  a knife attack in
Jerusalem  Tuesday,  an  assault  police  said may be linked to eight other
stabbings  blamed  on  a Jewish extremist. The 50-year-old victim was found
during  morning  rush hour in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Mea
Shearim.  He  was  taken  into  surgery  at  Hadassah Hospital, said police
spokeswoman  Sigal Toledo. Toledo said a bloody knife was found in the area
at about 6 a.m., but despite a search of the area, the victim was not found
until  a  passer-by came upon him 90 minutes later. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu  and  Jerusalem Police Chief Yair Yitzhaki said the attack may be
linked  to  the  stabbings of eight other Palestinians in Mea Shearim since
November 1997.

14.01.99  ,  Israeli  army officials say an Israeli border guard was killed
and a Palestinian seriously wounded yesterday in attacke near the West Bank
town of Hebron.

25.01.99 , Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will reportedly leave
his  position  today after being fired for planning a move to an opposition
political  party.  Reports  from Israel say three other former officials of
Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu's  Likud  party will join Mordechai in
forming   a   new  centrist  opposition  party:  former  army  chief  Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak,  former  finance  minister  Dan  Meridor and former Tel Aviv
Mayor Roni Milo.

26.01.99  ,  Israel  razed  an  Arab-owned  home  in Jerusalem Tuesday, and
helmeted troops protecting the demolition equipment fired rubber bullets at
Palestinian   protesters   who   hurled   stones  toward  the  house.  Four
Palestinians  were  injured  by  rubber  bullets,  including one who was in
serious  condition.  A fifth was treated for bruises after being clubbed by
Israeli troops. One of the injured, Zaki Obeid, fell to the ground bleeding
profusely  after  being  struck  in  the  face  by  a rubber bullet. He lay
motionless  for  a  few  moments  before being carried away to the cries of
"Allah u Akbar!" or "God is great."

27.01.99 , One day after winning his party's nomination for prime minister,
Benjamin  Netanyahu  has  put  together  a  team he hopes will help him win
re-election.  It  wasn't easy. As he watched his opponents gain supporters,
Netanyahu  mostly  counted  deserters. His former defense minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai,  has  joined  forces  to  lead  a  new  centrist  party  with  a
charismatic general, a popular former Tel Aviv mayor and a finance minister
who quit Netanyahu's government. Under the slogan "One Nation," Ehud Barak,
the  leader  of the opposition Labor party, is gaining support from smaller
parties.   At   a  news  conference,  Netanyahu  introduced  his  partners,
right-wing  Likud  veteran  Moshe  Arens,  who  was to replace Mordechai as
defense minister, and hawkish Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon.

28.01.99  ,  A  Palestinian  man  died  Thursday  from wounds suffered when
Israeli  troops  shot  him in the head with a rubber-coated steel bullet, a
hospital spokeswoman said. Zaki Obeid was critically injured Tuesday during
a  clash  between  Israeli  riot  police  and  Palestinians  protesting the
demolition of an Arab home in east Jerusalem. Obeid died Thursday afternoon
from  the  bullet  that  lodged  in the rear of his brain, Hadassa hospital
spokeswoman Yael Bosom said.</p></pre>

01.02.99  ,  The deadline for an Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security deal
passed  yesterday  with  key provisions of last year's Wye River accord not
yet  implemented.  Among  measured  not yet implemented: the release of 750
Palestinian  prisoners,  the  opening  of a route between the West Bank and
Gaza, and Israeli withdrawal of troops from 14% of the West Bank.

03.02.99  ,  Palestinian  Authority President Yasser Arafat is scheduled to
meet  today  and  tomorrow  with U.S. Secretary of State and President Bill
Clinton in Washington.

08.02.99  ,  King  Hussein's funeral brought together sworn enemies Monday,
including a PLO guerrilla leader who approached Israel's president, praised
him  as  a  man  of  peace,  and  shook his hand. The scene involving Nayef
Hawatmeh and Ezer Weizman was witnessed by Weizman's adviser, Arieh Shumer,
who  said  it  was a random encounter. Weizman took Hawatmeh's outstretched
hand and told him the time had come to make peace with Syria and Lebanon.

10.02.99   ,   Israel   rejected  a  U.N.  General  Assembly  call  for  an
international  conference on Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank,
charging Wednesday that it violates peace accords with the Palestinians. By
a  vote of 115-2 with five abstentions, the General Assembly Tuesday called
for  a  conference  of  the  signatories  of the 1949 Geneva Conventions to
consider measures to stop Israeli settlement activity.

12.02.99  ,  In  a  surprise  move, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Friday
revived  an  idea  for  forging a confederation between Jordan and a future
Palestinian  state. Arafat's proposal won a cool reception in Jordan, where
an  official,  speaking  on  condition of anonymity, said any decision on a
confederation  must  wait until the West Bank and Gaza Strip are under full
Palestinian control.

19.02.99  ,  Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat met with Pope John Paul II
Friday and renewed his invitation for the pontiff to visit Bethlehem in the
year 2000.</p></pre>

29.03.99  ,  Stepping up the battle over Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin

offices   in   Jerusalem   yesterday,  saying  that,  under  interim  peace

the  city.  Palestinian  officials characterized the move as a pre-election
"stunt" by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

08.04.99  ,  Japan's  prime  minister  urged  Yasser  Arafat not to declare
Palestinian  statehood  before  restarting  talks with Israel, a government

13.04.99  ,  The  Palestinian  leadership  will  decide April 27 whether to
declare  a  state  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip a week later or heed the

Palestinian  statehood in exchange for a delay in the declaration of such a

23.04.99 , Israel's decision to close Palestinian headquarters in Jerusalem
smacks  of  electioneering  and  could provoke a violent response . Israeli
security  chiefs  met  to  consider  deploying more police in the contested
city.  The  Palestinian  compound,  known  as the Orient House, is a small,
century-old  hotel  that  was  already  serving  as  Palestinian  political
headquarters  before  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  started signing peace
agreements  in  1993.  The  government  moved to shut down the Orient House
Thursday, after Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem,
invited European consuls to the offices.

agreed  to postpone a declaration of an independent Palestinian state until
at least after Israel's upcoming general election.</p></pre>

Benjamin  Netanyahu,  Ehud  Barak  promised Tuesday to forge a secure peace
with  the  Palestinians,  pull troops out of Lebanon in a year and heal the
deep  divisions  among  Israelis.  After  three  years  at Israel's helm, a
tearful Netanyahu gracefully conceded defeat and said he would step down as
leader  of  his  Likud  party. In an emotional speech, Barak, Israel's most
decorated  soldier,  promised tens of thousands of supporters that he would
continue  the  path of peace forged by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
He  spoke  in  Rabin  Square - the plaza in Tel Aviv where Rabin was gunned
down in 1995.

20.05.99  ,  Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak said yesterday that he
intends  to head the nation's defense ministry himself. Barak said the move
is  intended  to  allow  himself  greater  control  over both political and

clashes in the West Bank and Gaza.

14.06.99  ,  Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the
government  to  bring  thousands  of Jews left behind in Ethiopia to Israel
quickly.  Some  2,500-3,500  Jews in the Quara region of Ethiopia were left
behind  when  some  21,500  others  came to Israel years ago, and have been
trying to reach the Jewish state ever since.

those parties involved to push the peace process forward.

05.10.1999  ,  Israel  and the Palestinians agreed Tuesday to establish the
first  open  land  link  between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - seen by
Palestinians as a vital step toward eventual statehood. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak  and  Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat approved the deal, which would
allow Palestinians for the first time to move relatively freely between the
areas,  traveling  on a fixed set of highways across the breadth of Israel.
The  so-called "safe passage" route will provide Arafat with one of the key
underpinnings  of the state he has long sought, and is the most significant
achievement of the newly revived peace process.

11.10.1999  ,  The Israeli cabinet gave Prime Minister Ehud Barak the power
yesterday  to  close unauthorized Jewish outposts in the West Bank . In the
other  hand,  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud  Barak  yesterday approved the
building  of  2,600  new apartments in West Bank settlements. - Barak said,
however, that unauthorized Jewish settlers will not be allowed to remain in
the territory

15.10.1999  ,  Israel  freed 151 Arab security prisoners Friday, moving its
peace  agreement  with  the  Palestinians back on track after minor delays.

Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.  Prisoners  leaned out of windows, flashing victory
signs,  their  hands  still  tied with plastic cuffs. "Mother, he's out," a
teen-age  boy  shouted into a cellular phone when he saw his brother on one
of  the  buses.  Prisoner  releases  are  an emotional issue . Palestinians
consider the inmates heroes in the struggle for independence.

roads  this  morning  that  connects the Palestinian areas of West Bank and
Gaza.

east  Jerusalem  on  Monday  despite  a  promise  to  slow the pace of such
demolitions.  Israel's police minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, opposes demolishing
Palestinian  homes  built  without  permits  and  has been re-examining the
practice. Since moderate Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office July 6, only
four homes have been razed. The owner of the house destroyed Monday, Fouwad
Khader, said he had been warned by police that his home would be demolished
and obtained a court order in an effort to block the action.</p></pre>

01.11.1999  ,  President  Clinton  said  Monday he hopes to inject "renewed
energy"  into  the  Israeli-Palestinian  peace process, and encouraged both
sides  to move quickly toward agreement on a final treaty within 10 months.

them,"  Clinton  told  reporters  during a question-and-answer session with

final  peace treaty today in the West Bank town of Ramallah. - two hours of

people in the Israeli coastal town of Netanya yesterday.

10.11.1999 , Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Cabinet Wednesday approved a troop
withdrawal  from  5%  of  the West Bank, hours after Israeli troops dragged
hundreds of Jewish settlers, some kicking and others hurling red paint, out
of  a  key  encampment. The confrontation at Havat Maon was one of the most
dramatic  between  settlers  and  the  government  since  1982, when Israel
leveled  the  Yamit  settlement in the Sinai Peninsula as part of its peace
treaty  with Egypt. The eviction was followed by the Cabinet's 17-1 vote to
approve next week's Israeli troop withdrawal.

15.11.1999 , Reports say Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have failed to
finalize  a  plan  for the turnover of an additional 5% of the West Bank to
Palestinian control. - the exchange was to have been made this morning.

15.11.1999  ,  The  11th  Palestinian  independence  day  had all the right
ingredients  -  cheering  crowds,  boy scouts and military parades. But for
many Palestinians, Monday's celebration was a painful reminder of what they
are missing - a state of their own. The mood was also dampened by the delay
of an Israeli troop pullback from 5% of the West Bank, originally scheduled
for   Monday.   The  two  sides  disagreed  over  the  pullback,  with  the
Palestinians saying the areas Israel offered to hand over were too sparsely
populated  and  failed  to  connect  the  isolated  enclaves  already under
Palestinian control.

17.11.1999  ,  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton are expected to discuss the stalled handover of West Bank territory
to Palestinian control when they meet today in Istanbul, Turkey.

23.11.1999  ,  Reports  say about 15 Jewish settlers occupied a new site in
the  West  Bank  this  morning in protest against Israeli policies that are
removing    such    settlements.    -    the   settlement   is   near   the
Palestinian-controlled town of Bethlehem.</p></pre>

01.12.1999  ,  Israel's  proposals  for  surrendering  West  Bank  land  to
Palestinian control topped the agenda of Wednesday's talks between Egyptian
President  Hosni  Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Speaking to
reporters  before  leaving Cairo to return to Gaza, Arafat said discussions
focused  on  the  current  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and Palestinian
objections  to  the  maps of a proposed Israeli troop withdrawal from 5% of
the  West  Bank and Jewish settlements in the territory. The withdrawal was
scheduled to take place Nov. 15 under the Israeli-Palestinian accord signed
in  September  after U.S. mediation. But the Palestinians rejected Israel's
proposed  redeployments,  saying  they  vacated  areas that were too thinly
populated and not contiguous.

02.12.1999  , Palestinian lawmaker Mouawiyah al-Masri, who was wounded by a
gunman  yesterday,  suggested  today  that  he was shot because he signed a
leaflet   accusing   Palestinian   Authority  President  Yasser  Arafat  of
encouraging corruption.

15.12.1999  ,  Peace  talks  between  Israel  and  Syria  resume  today  in
Washington,  DC,  following  a four-year break. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak  and  Syrian  Foreign  Minister  Farouq  al-Shara will meet with U.S.
President Bill Clinton this morning.

29.12.1999  ,  After  several  weeks of delay, Israel Wednesday released 26
Palestinian  security  prisoners as part of the latest interim peace accord
with  the  Palestinians.  Buses carrying the 26 inmates left two prisons in
the  southern  Negev  Desert  and  the  coastal  city of Ashkelon Wednesday
afternoon.  The  releases  had  been held up for several hours by a Supreme
Court  appeal filed by relatives of Israelis killed in attacks. In the end,
the  justices  refused  to  stop the releases. The release is the third and
final  one  under  an  interim peace accord signed in September. In the two
earlier  releases,  350 Palestinians convicted of anti-Israel offenses were
set  free.  The  Palestinians complained that many of those freed Wednesday
have  only a few months left to serve. They had demanded that a much larger
number of prisoners be released, including those sentenced to long terms.</p></pre>
