Deciding  to  establish  peace  between them in accordance with
this Treaty of Peace;

Have agreed as follows:


ARTICLE 1 : ESTABLISHMENT OF PEACE
----------------------------------
Peace is hereby established between the State of Israel and the
Hashemite  Kingdom of Jordan (the "Parties") effective from the

ARTICLE 2 : GENERAL PRINCIPLES
------------------------------
The  Parties  will  apply  between  them  the provisions of the
Charter   of   the   United   Nations  and  the  principles  of
international  law governing relations among states in times of
peace. In particular:


They  recognise  and  will  respect  each  other's sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence;

They  recognise  and will respect each other's right to live in
peace within secure and recognised boundaries;

They  will  develop  good neighbourly relations of co-operation
between  them to ensure lasting security, will refrain from the
threat  or  use of force against each other and will settle all

They  further  believe  that  within their control, involuntary
movements  of  persons  in such a way as to adversely prejudice
the security of either Party should not be permitted.


ARTICLE 3 : INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY
----------------------------------
The   international  boundary  between  Israel  and  Jordan  is
delimited  with  reference to the boundary definition under the
Mandate  as  is  shown in Annex I (a), on the mapping materials
attached thereto and co-ordinates specified therein.

The  boundary,  as  set  out  in Annex I (a), is the permanent,
secure and recognised international boundary between Israel and
Jordan, without prejudice to the status of any territories that
came under Israeli military government control in 1967.

The  parties  recognise  the international boundary, as well as
each  other's  territory,  territorial  waters and airspace, as
inviolable, and will respect and comply with them.

The demarcation of the boundary will take place as set forth in
Appendix  (I)  to  Annex I and will be concluded not later than
nine months after the signing of the Treaty.

It  is  agreed  that where the boundary follows a river, in the
event of natural changes in the course of the flow of the river
as  described in Annex I (a), the boundary shall follow the new
course  of  the  flow.  In  the  event of any other changes the
boundary shall not be affected unless otherwise agreed.

Immediately   upon   the   exchange   of   the  instruments  of
ratification of this Treaty, each Party will deploy on its side
of the international boundary as defined in Annex I (a).

The Parties shall, upon the signature of the Treaty, enter into
negotiations  to conclude, within 9 months, an agreement on the
delimitation of their maritime boundary in the Gulf of Aqaba.

Taking   into   account   the   special  circumstances  of  the
Naharayim/Baqura  area,  which  is under Jordanian sovereignty,
with  Israeli  private  ownership rights, the Parties agreed to
apply the provisions set out in Annex I (b).

With respect to the Zofar/Al-Ghamr area, the provisions set out
in Annex I (c) will apply.

ARTICLE 4 : SECURITY
--------------------
Both  Parties,  acknowledging  that  mutual  understanding  and
co-operation   in   security-related   matters   will   form  a
significant  part  of  their relations and will further enhance
the  security of the region, take upon themselves to base their
security  relations  on  mutual  trust,  advancement  of  joint
interests  and  co-  operation,  and  to aim towards a regional
framework of partnership in peace.

Towards that goal the Parties recognise the achievements of the
European Community and European Union in the development of the
Conference  on  Security  and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and
commit  themselves  to  the  creation, in the Middle East, of a
CSCME  (Conference  on  Security and Co-operation in the Middle
East).  This commitment entails the adoption of regional models
of  security successfully implemented in the post World War era
(along  the  lines  of  the  Helsinki process) culminating in a
regional zone of security and stability.

The  obligations  referred  to  in  this  Article  are  without
prejudice  to  the inherent right of self-defence in accordance
with the United Nations Charter.

The  Parties  undertake,  in  accordance with the provisions of
this Article, the following:

to  refrain  from  the  threat  or  use  of  force  or weapons,
conventional,  non-conventional  or  of any other kind, against
each  other,  or  of other actions or activities that adversely
affect the security of the other Party;

to refrain from organising, instigating, inciting, assisting or
participating  in  acts  or threats of belligerency, hostility,
subversion or violence against the other Party;

to take necessary and effective measures to ensure that acts or
threats  of  belligerency,  hostility,  subversion  or violence
against  the  other  Party  do  not originate from, and are not
committed  within, through or over their territory (hereinafter
the  term  "territory"  includes  the  airspace and territorial
waters).

Consistent  with the era of peace and with the efforts to build
regional  security  and  to  avoid  and  prevent aggression and
violence,  the  Parties  further  agree  to  refrain  from  the
following:

joining or in any way assisting, promoting or co-operating with
any  coalition,  organisation  or  alliance  with a military or
security  character  with  a  third  party,  the  objectives or
activities  of which include launching aggression or other acts
of military hostility against the other Party, in contravention
of the provisions of the present Treaty.

allowing   the   entry,   stationing  and  operating  on  their
territory,  or  through  it,  of  military forces, personnel or
materiel of a third party, in circumstances which may adversely
prejudice the security of the other Party.

Both  Parties  will  take necessary and effective measures, and
will  co-operate  in  combating  terrorism  of  all  kinds. The
Parties undertake:

to  take  necessary  and  effective measures to prevent acts of
terrorism,  subversion  or violence from being carried out from
their  territory  or  through  it  and  to  take  necessary and
effective  measures  to  combat  such  activities and all their
perpetrators.

without  prejudice to the basic rights of freedom of expression
and  association,  to  take necessary and effective measures to
prevent the entry, presence and co-operation in their territory
of  any  group or organisation, and their infrastructure, which
threatens  the  security  of  the  other Party by the use of or
incitement to the use of, violent means.

to   co-operate  in  preventing  and  combating  cross-boundary
infiltrations.

Any  question  as to the implementation of this Article will be
dealt  with  through  a  mechanism  of consultations which will
include  a liaison system, verification, supervision, and where
necessary, other mechanisms, and higher level consultation. The
details  of the mechanism of consultations will be contained in
an  agreement to be concluded by the Parties within 3 months of
the exchange of the instruments of ratification of this Treaty.

The  Parties  undertake to work as a matter of priority, and as
soon  as  possible  in  the context of the Multilateral Working
Group  on  Arms  Control  and  Regional  Security, and jointly,
towards the following:

the  creation  in the Middle East of a region free from hostile
alliances and coalitions;

the  creation  of  a  Middle  East  free  from  weapons of mass
destruction,  both  conventional  and non- conventional, in the
context   of   a   comprehensive,  lasting  and  stable  peace,
characterised   by  the  renunciation  of  the  use  of  force,
reconciliation and goodwill.


ARTICLE 5 : DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER BILATERAL RELATIONS
----------------------------------------------------
The  Parties  agree  to  establish full diplomatic and consular
relations and to exchange resident ambassadors within one month
of  the  exchange  of  the  instruments of ratification of this
Treaty.

will further include economic and cultural relations.


ARTICLE 6 : WATER
-----------------
With   the  view  to  achieving  a  comprehensive  and  lasting
settlement of all the water problems between them:


The   Parties   agree   mutually   to  recognise  the  rightful
allocations  of  both of them in Jordan River and Yarmouk River
waters  and  Araba/Arava  ground  water  in accordance with the
agreed acceptable principles, quantities and quality as set out
in Annex II , which shall be fully respected and complied with.

The  Parties,  recognising  the  necessity to find a practical,
just  and  agreed solution to their water problems and with the
view  that  the  subject  of  water  can form the basis for the
advancement of co- operation between them, jointly undertake to
ensure  that  the  management  and  development  of their water
resources  do  not, in any way, harm the water resources of the
other Party.

The  Parties  recognise  that  their  water  resources  are not
sufficient  to  meet their needs. More water should be supplied
for  their  use  through various methods, including projects of
regional and international co-operation.

In light of paragraph 3 of this Article, with the understanding
that  co-operation  in  water-related  subjects would be to the
benefit  of  both  Parties, and will help alleviate their water
shortages,  and  that  water issues along their entire boundary
must be dealt with in their totality, including the possibility
of  trans-boundary water transfers, the Parties agree to search
for  ways to alleviate water shortage and to co- operate in the
following fields:

development of existing and new water resources, increasing the
water  availability including co- operation on a regional basis
as  appropriate,  and  minimising  wastage  of  water resources
through the chain of their uses;

prevention of contamination of water resources;

mutual assistance in the alleviation of water shortages;

transfer  of  information and joint research and development in
water-related  subjects,  and  review  of  the  potentials  for
enhancement of water resources development and use.

The  implementation  of  both  Parties' undertakings under this
Article is detailed in Annex II.


ARTICLE 7 : ECONOMIC RELATIONS

Viewing  economic  development  and  prosperity  as  pillars of
peace,   security  and  harmonious  relations  between  states,
peoples  and  individual human beings, the Parties, taking note
of  understandings  reached  between  them, affirm their mutual
desire  to  promote economic co-operation between them, as well
as   within   the   framework   of   wider   regional  economic
co-operation.

In  order  to  accomplish  this  goal, the Parties agree to the
following:

to  remove  all  discriminatory  barriers  to  normal  economic
relations,  to  terminate  economic  boycotts  directed at each
other, and to co-operate in terminating boycotts against either
Party by third parties;

recognising  that  the  principle of free and unimpeded flow of
goods  and  services  should guide their relations, the Parties
will   enter  into  negotiations  with  a  view  to  concluding
agreements  on  economic co- operation, including trade and the
establishment  of  a  free  trade  area,  investment,  banking,
