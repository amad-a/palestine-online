On  March  3  Palestinian  leader  Yasser  Arafat  had a meetings with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and other U.S. officials .
<a name="4mar97"></a>
On  March  4  Israel  ordered four Palestinian organizations to close their
offices  in  East Jerusalem. Israel says that the offices were parts of the
Palestinian  Authority,  which  is  not allowed to maintain offices outside
Gaza Strip and the parts under its direct control in the west bank .
<a name="7mar97"></a>
On  March  7  the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to increase the West Bank
lands  under Palestinian authority control by 9 percent. The offer has been
rejected by the Palestinian authority .
<a name="13mar97"></a>
On  March  13  a Jordanian soldier opened fire on a group of Israeli school
children near the Israeli-Jordanian border, killing seven. An investigation
found that the soldier was emotionally disturbed . King Hussein traveled to
Israel to visits to the victim's families.
<a name="15mar97"></a>
On  March  15 Arafat called for an emergency conference in the Gaza Strip .
Several  European  countries and the United States attended the conference.
Arafat  called the conference to pressure on Israel to abandon the Har Homa
project .
<a name="18mar97"></a>
On March 18, Israeli workers began construction at the Har Homa site.
<a name="21mar97"></a>
On  March  21, a bomb exploded in a sidewalk cafe in Tel Aviv , killing the
bomber  and three other people. Dozens more were wounded. Hamas, a militant
Islamic  group, took responsibility for the bombing. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin  Netanyahu  accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of giving the
"green  light"  to renewed attacks in retaliation for Israeli approval of a
new Jewish settlement in largely Arab East Jerusalem.

On  March 7 and 21, the United States vetoed a United Nations (UN) Security
Council  resolution  that  described  the  new settlement as "illegal." The
United States routinely vetoes Security Council resolutions it perceives as
biased against Israel.

Peres, a Labor Party cofounder and one of the architects of the Middle East
peace  process.  If  elected prime minister, Barak has said he would follow
Rabin's policies and move the peace process forward. He is also expected to
move  the  party  away  from its left-wing origins and toward the political
center.</p></pre>

roadblocks at the entrances to the autonomous Palestinian areas.</p></pre>

September 97
------------

On  September 4 , Three martyr  bombers evidently acting in concert set off
bombs  on  a  popular  shopping promenade in Jerusalem on Thursday, killing
four  passers-by  and  themselves.  The  three explosions followed in quick
succession  at  about  3:10  p.m.  on Ben Yehuda Street, a shady pedestrian
thorough fare in West Jerusalem lined with boutiques and outdoor cafes, and
packed with Israelis and foreign tourists. Officials said eight people were
severely wounded, and about 180 others were also hurt.
<a name="9sep97"></a>
On  September  9  ,  United  States  Secretary  of State Madeleine Albright
arrived  in  Israel  the first stop on a weeklong Middle East tour aimed at
generating  new momentum for the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Albright visited Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria,
and  Lebanon  before  leaving the region on September 15. Albright said her
efforts  resulted  in  some progress. Palestinian authorities arrested some
Islamic  militants. Israel said it would unfreeze tax revenues owed the PNA
and  ease  restrictions  that  prevent Palestinians from travelling between
Palestinian-controlled  areas-measures that were imposed in response to the
recent martyr bombings.
<a name="19sep97"></a>
On  September  19  ,  Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at stone-throwing
Arabs  until Palestinian police intervened to stop the protests in the West
Bank  town  of  Hebron  on  Friday. No one was hurt in the demonstration by
about  50  Palestinians  against  an Israeli government deal letting Jewish
seminary  students  stay  in  Arab East Jerusalem buildings in place of the
Jewish families who occupied them.</p></pre>

October 97
----------

On  October  1 , Sheik Ahmed Yassin-the 61-year-old founder of the militant
Islamic  group  Hamas  was  released  from  Israeli  prison  , as part of a
prisoner  swap  touched  off  by  a failed Israeli assassination attempt in
Amman,  the  capital  of  Jordan. The events that led Israel to free Yassin
unfolded on September 25 when Israeli agents reportedly attempted to poison
Khaled  Meshal, a senior member of Hamas, in Amman. Jordan's King Hussein I
threatened  to  cut  diplomatic  relations  unless  the  Israeli government
provided  an  antidote  to the poison and agreed to free Yassin and several
dozen Palestinians and Jordanians held in Israeli prisons.
<a name="8oct97"></a>
On  October  8 , The long-frozen peace process thawed somewhat as Netanyahu
and  Palestinian  National  Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat met for
the  first time since February 1997. United States Middle East envoy Dennis
Ross,  who  helped organize the October 8 meeting, said that both sides had
agreed to resume negotiations.</p></pre>

December 1997
-------------

On  December  11,  Palestinian census takers stand in the rain, knocking on
people's  doors  in  traditionally-Arab  east Jerusalem. But many residents
literally  hide  behind their closed doors, fearing a census which anywhere
else  would  be  an  exercise  in basic civics. Even answering questions as
simple  as  "Do  you  have central heating?" can be risky. East Jerusalem's
Palestinians  do  not  allow  themselves  to be photographed, for fear that
Israeli  authorities  will revoke their residency cards and evict them from
the  city  where  their  families  have lived for centuries. The first-ever
Palestinian  census  turned  into a tug-of-war over Jerusalem when Israel's
government  pushed  a  bill  through  Parliament  blocking  Yasser Arafat's
census-takers from operating in the disputed city.</p></pre>
