on-going  basis  the  works  related to the construction of the
Gaza Sea Port, including the movement in and out of the Port of
vessels,  equipment,  resources,  and material required for the

act  to  ensure the immediate, efficient and effective handling
of  any  incident  involving  a  threat  or  act  of terrorism,
violence  or  incitement,  whether committed by Palestinians or
Israelis.  To  this end, they will cooperate in the exchange of
information  and  coordinate policies and activities. Each side
shall  immediately and effectively respond to the occurrence or
anticipated  occurrence  of  an  act  of terrorism, violence or
incitement  and  shall  take  all necessary measures to prevent
such an occurrence;

Pursuant   to   the  prior  agreements,  the  Palestinian  side
undertakes  to  implement  its  responsibilities  for security,
security  cooperation,  on-going  obligations  and other issues
emanating  from the prior agreements, including, in particular,

Strip in accordance with the Interim Agreement.
