<center><h2><font color="Blue">1981 - President Sadat assassinated</font></h2></center>
<pre><p align=center>On  October 6th, President Mohammed Anwar el Sadat of Egypt was murdered by
Islamic  fundamentalist  gunmen  in  Cairo. The shooting happened at 1 p.m.
during  the  annual  military  parade  to  commemorate the beginning of the
Egyptian  attacked in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war . A lorry in the procession
stopped  in  front  of the rostrum where the President and other luminaries
were  watching a fly-past of Egyptian Air Force jets. Armed men climbed out
and  ran  toward  Sadat,  hurling  grenades and opening fire with automatic
weapons.  The  President and seven others fell, mortally wounded. Sadat was
flown  to  the Maadi military hospital where he died an hour and 40 minutes
later.  Sadat's  funeral on October 10th was attended by only one Arab head
of  state.  He  had isolated himself in the Arab world by the rapprochement
with  Israel  which had won him and Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in
1978  and  led  to  a peace treaty between the two countries in 1979. Iraq,
Libya,  Syria  and the Palestinian Liberation Organization openly applauded
his assassination. </p></pre>

Bayrut,  the  PLO  agreed to withdraw its guerrillas from the city. Israeli
troops  remained  in southern Lebanon, however, and the cost of the war and
subsequent   occupation  drained  the  already  troubled  Israeli  economy.

<center><h2><font color="Blue">1993 - Washington peace agreement</font></h2></center>
<pre><p align=center>Events  in  the  Middle  East  took a surprising turn in 1993. After secret
negotiations,  Prime  Minister Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat flew to
Washington, D.C., and agreed to the signing of an historic peace agreement.
Israel  agreed  to allow for Palestinian self-rule, first in the Gaza Strip
and  the  West  Bank  town of Jericho, and later in other areas of the West
Bank that are not settled by Jews .

In  Sept,93  , At a ceremony in Washington, D.C., representatives of Israel
and  the  Palestine  Liberation  Organization  (PLO)  signed  an  agreement
designed  to  end  45  years  of  confrontation  between  the  Israelis and
Palestinians.  The  actual  signing  was done by Israel's foreign minister,
Shimon  Peres,  and  PLO  foreign  policy  spokesman,  Mahmoud Abbas. Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and PLO leader Yasser Arafat met and shook
hands  on  the  White  House  lawn, as President Bill Clinton of the United
States  and  3,000 guests looked on. The agreement was limited in scope; it
provided  for  transfer  of  the Gaza Strip and Jericho to Palestinian rule
within  a  few  months.  But  the  accord  was  regarded as a first step in
resolving  years  of  violent  conflict  between Jews and Palestinians. The
agreement  had been worked out secretly in Oslo, Norway, with the mediation
of  Norway's foreign minister, Johan Jorgen Holst. Following the signing, a
long process of negotiation began on the means of transferring power in the
occupied lands. </p></pre>

<center><h2><font color="Blue">1994 - Hebron mosque massacre</font></h2></center>
<pre><p align=center>In  Feb.1994 , An American-born Jewish settler in Hebron, Baruch Goldstein,
opened  fire in al-Haran al-ebrahime crowded mosque, killing 29 Muslims and
wounding 150 more. Additional Muslims were crushed to death in the panic to
flee  the mosque and in rioting that followed. The attacker used an assault
rifle  to  shoot at more than 400 Muslims, who were in the mosque for early
morning  prayers  during  the  holy month of Ramadan. The mosque itself was
part  of a complex of buildings sacred to both Jews and Muslims, because it
was  believed  to contain the 4,000-year-old burial tomb of Abraham and his
wife  Sarah.  As  such,  the  place  had  long  been  a  site for religious
confrontations. News of the massacre immediately led to riots in Hebron and
the  rest  of  the occupied territories. The crime called into question the
possibility of continuing the peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians,
Jordan,  and  Syria.  In  late  1993  Israel and the Palestinian Liberation
Organization  had  signed  an agreement designed to bring peace between the
two group. </p></pre>

Yitzhak  Rabin,  prime  minister of Israel, signed the final version of the
Declaration  of  Principles  that  had  been signed in Washington, D.C., on
Sept.  13,  1993.  The accord was regarded as a start toward bringing peace
between  Israelis  and  Palestinians  after 45 years of conflict. Within 24
hours  of  the signing, Israeli military forces were scheduled to leave the
Gaza Strip and Jericho, ending 27 years of occupation of those territories.
A  Palestinian police force was ready to move into the areas to keep order.
Among  the  foreign visitors at the ceremony were Secretary of State Warren
Christopher  of  the  United  States, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of
Russia,  and  Foreign  Minister  Koji  Kazikawa  of  Japan. In spite of the

vowed to keep fragile peace negotiations on track. Hamas, the Islamic group
opposed  to  the  peace  process,  claimed  responsibility  for the attack.
Israeli  authorities  arrested more than 60 Hamas members between August 23
and  August  27,  charging  them  with  planning  the July 24 and August 21
bombings. </p></pre>

<center><h2><font color="Blue">1995 - Oslo  II Agreement signed in Washington</font></h2></center>
<pre><p align=center>In Sept. 24 , Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) officials
meeting in Taba, Egypt, finalized agreement on the second stage of eventual
Israeli  withdrawal  from  Palestinian  lands.  Under  the  pact, which was
officially  signed on September 28 in Washington, D.C., Israeli forces were
scheduled  to  be removed from six Arab cities and 400 villages in the West
Bank  by  early  1996,  after which elections would be held for a 82-member
Palestinian council, which would possess legislative and executive power in
the West Bank and Gaza.

Special  arrangements  were  agreed  upon for the West Bank city of Hebron,
where  Israeli  soldiers  will  remain  to  protect the 450 Jewish settlers
living  there.  Disagreement  over the status of Hebron almost scuttled the
agreement,  and  it took almost a week of non-stop negotiations between PLO
leader  Yasser  Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to resolve
the issue.

The  pact  was  the second stage in a three-step process agreed upon in the
Declaration  of  Principles,  a framework for eventual Palestinian autonomy
signed  by  the  PLO  and  Israel in September 1993. The first phase in the
process  was  finalized  in  May  1994, when an accord was signed in Cairo,
Egypt,  for  the pullout of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank  town  of Jericho and the handing over of administrative duties to the
Palestinian  National Authority, led by Arafat. The third stage will tackle
such  contentious  issues  as  the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Israeli
settlers,  and  the  final borders between Israel and the Palestinian state
that  many  analysts  believe  is close to becoming a reality. Negotiations
concerning  the  last phase of the peace process were scheduled to begin in
May  1996,  with  any  agreement  to  be  implemented before the end of the
century. </p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>In  Nov.4  ,  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated in Tel
Aviv  by  a right-wing extremist who considered Rabin's crusade for peace a
betrayal of the Jewish state. The prime minister was shot three times as he
was  getting  into his car to leave a peace rally at 9:30 PM local time. He
was  rushed  to  nearby  Ichilov  Hospital  but  had  no heartbeat or blood
pressure when admitted to the emergency room. Doctors tried without success
to  revive  Rabin,  but he was pronounced dead at 11:10 PM. Israeli Foreign
Minister  Shimon  Peres  took  over leadership of the Labor government upon
Rabin's death. </p></pre>
