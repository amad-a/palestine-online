The Madrid Declaration
----------------------
June 27, 1989
-------------
1989 Summit of the EU regarding the Middle East
-----------------------------------------------

The  European  Council has examined the situation in the Middle
East  conflict  in  the  light  of  recent  events and contacts
undertaken over several months by the Presidency and the Troika
with  the  parties  concerned,  and  it has drawn the following
conclusions:

1.  The  policy  of  the  Twelve on the Middle East conflict is
defined  in  the  Venice  Declaration of 13 June 1980 and other
subsequent  declarations. It consists in upholding the right to
security of all states in the region, including Israel, that is
to  say,  to  live  within  secure,  recognized  and guaranteed
frontiers,  and in upholding justice for all the peoples of the
region,  which includes recognition of the legitimate rights of
the    Palestinian    people,    including   their   right   to
self-determination with all that this implies.

The Twelve consider that these objectives should be achieved by
peaceful  means  in  the  framework  of  an international peace
conference  under  the  auspices  of the United Nations, as the
appropriate  forum  for  the  direct  negotiations  between the
parties  concerned,  with  a  view to a comprehensive, just and
lasting settlement.

The  European  Council  is also of the view that the PLO should
participate in this process. It expresses its support for every
effort  by the permanent members of the Security Council of the
United  Nations  to bring the parties closer together, create a
climate  of confidence between them, and facilitate in this way
the convening of the international conference.

2.  The community and its Member States have demonstrated their
readiness   to   participate  actively  in  the  search  for  a
negotiated  solution  to the conflict and to cooperate fully in
the  social  and  economic  development  of  the peoples of the
region.

The  European  Council expresses its satisfaction regarding the
policy   of   contacts  with  all  parties  undertaken  by  the
Presidency and the Troika, and has decided to purse it.

3.  The  European  Council  welcomes  the  support given by the
Extraordinary  Summit  Meeting  of  the  Arab  League,  held in
Casablanca,  to  the  decisions  of  the  Palestinian  National
Council  in  Algiers,  involving acceptance of Security Council
Resolutions  242  and 338, which resulted in the recognition of
Israel's  right  to  exist,  as  well  as  the  renunciation of
terrorism.

It also welcomes the efforts undertaken by the United States in
their   contracts  with  the  parties  directly  concerned  and
particularly the dialogue entered into with the PLO

Advantage  should  be taken of these favorable circumstances to
engender  a  spirit  of  tolerance  and  peace  with  a view to
entering resolutely on the path of negotiations..

4.  The  European Council deplores the continuing deterioration
of  the  situation in the Occupied Territories and the constant
increase  in  the number of dead and wounded, and the suffering
of the population.

It appeals urgently to the Israeli authorities to put an end to
repressive measures, to implement Resolutions 605, 607, and 608
of  the  Security  Council and to respect the provisions of the
Geneva  Convention on the Protection of Civilian Populations in
Times of War.

They   appeal  in  particular  for  the  reopening  educational
facilities in the West Bank.

5.  On  the  basis of the positions of principle of the Twelve,
the European Council welcomes the proposal for elections in the
Occupied  Territories  as  a contribution to the peace process,
provided that:

The  elections  are  set  in the context of a process towards a
comprehensive,  just,  and  lasting settlement of the conflict.
the elections take place in the Occupied Territories, including
East  Jerusalem,  under  adequate  guarantees  of  freedom.  no
solution  is  excluded and the final negotiation takes place on
the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 of the Security Council of
the United Nations, based on the principle of "land for peace".

6. the European Council launches a solemn appeal to the parties
concerned to seize the opportunity to achieve peace. Respect by
each  of  the  parties  for  the legitimate rights of the other
should  facilitate the normalizing of relations between all the
countries of the region.

The European Council calls upon the Arab countries to establish
normal  relations of peace and cooperation with Israel and asks
that  country in turn to recognize the right of the Palestinian
people to exercise self-determination.
