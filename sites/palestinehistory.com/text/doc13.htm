THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS
----------------------
The Framework for Peace in the Middle East

September 17, 1978

Muhammad  Anwar  al-Sadat,  President  of  the Arab Republic of
Egypt,  and  Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, met with
Jimmy  Carter,  President  of  the United States of America, at
Camp  David  from  September  5 to September 17, 1978, and have
agreed on the following framework for peace in the Middle East.
They invite other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere
to it.


Preamble
--------
The  search  for peace in the Middle East must be guided by the
following:

The  agreed  basis  for  a  peaceful settlement of the conflict
between  Israel  and  its  neighbors is United Nations Security
Council Resolution 242, in all its parts.

After  four  wars  during  30  years,  despite  intensive human
efforts,  the  Middle East, which is the cradle of civilization
and the birthplace of three great religions, does not enjoy the
blessings  of  peace.  The  people of the Middle East yearn for
peace  so  that  the  vast  human  and natural resources of the
region  can be turned to the pursuits of peace and so that this
area  can  become a model for coexistence and cooperation among
nations.

The   historic   initiative  of  President  Sadat  in  visiting
Jerusalem  and the reception accorded to him by the parliament,
government  and  people  of Israel, and the reciprocal visit of
Prime  Minister  Begin to Ismailia, the peace proposals made by
both  leaders,  as well as the warm reception of these missions
by the peoples of both countries, have created an unprecedented
opportunity for peace which must not be lost if this generation
and future generations are to be spared the tragedies of war.

The  provisions  of  the  Charter of the United Nations and the
other  accepted  norms  of international law and legitimacy now
provide  accepted  standards for the conduct of relations among
all states.

To  achieve a relationship of peace, in the spirit of Article 2
of  the  United  Nations  Charter,  future negotiations between
Israel  and  any  neighbor  prepared  to  negotiate  peace  and
security  with it are necessary for the purpose of carrying out
all the provisions and principles of Resolutions 242 and 338.

Peace   requires   respect  for  the  sovereignty,  territorial
integrity and political independence of every state in the area
and  their  right to live in peace within secure and recognized
boundaries  free from threats or acts of force. Progress toward
that   goal  can  accelerate  movement  toward  a  new  era  of
reconciliation  in  the  Middle  East  marked by cooperation in
promoting economic development, in maintaining stability and in
assuring security.

Security  is  enhanced  by  a  relationship  of  peace  and  by
cooperation  between  nations  which enjoy normal relations. In
addition,  under  the terms of peace treaties, the parties can,
on   the  basis  of  reciprocity,  agree  to  special  security
arrangements  such  as  demilitarized  zones, limited armaments
areas,  early  warning  stations, the presence of international
forces,  liaison,  agreed  measures  for  monitoring  and other
arrangements that they agree are useful.


Framework
---------
Taking  these  factors into account, the parties are determined
to  reach  a just, comprehensive, and durable settlement of the
Middle  East  conflict through the conclusion of peace treaties
based  on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 in all their
parts.  Their  purpose  is to achieve peace and good neighborly
relations.  They  recognize  that  for peace to endure, it must
involve  all  those  who  have been most deeply affected by the
conflict.   They   therefore  agree  that  this  framework,  as
appropriate,  is  intended  by  them  to constitute a basis for
peace  not  only  between  Egypt  and  Israel, but also between
Israel  and  each  of  its other neighbors which is prepared to
negotiate  peace with Israel on this basis. With that objective
in mind, they have agreed to proceed as follows:

A. West Bank and Gaza
---------------------
Egypt,   Israel,   Jordan   and   the  representatives  of  the
Palestinian  people  should  participate in negotiations on the
resolution  of  the  Palestinian problem in all its aspects. To
achieve  that objective, negotiations relating to the West Bank
and Gaza should proceed in three stages:

Egypt  and Israel agree that, in order to ensure a peaceful and
orderly  transfer  of  authority,  and  taking into account the
security   concerns   of  all  the  parties,  there  should  be
transitional  arrangements  for  the  West  Bank and Gaza for a
period  not  exceeding  five  years.  In  order to provide full
autonomy  to  the  inhabitants,  under  these  arrangements the
Israeli  military  government  and  its civilian administration
will  be  withdrawn  as  soon as a self-governing authority has
been  freely  elected  by  the  inhabitants  of  these areas to
replace  the  existing  military  government.  To negotiate the
details  of  a transitional arrangement, Jordan will be invited
to  join the negotiations on the basis of this framework. These
new  arrangements  should  give  due  consideration both to the
principle  of  self-government  by  the  inhabitants  of  these
territories  and  to  the  legitimate  security concerns of the
parties involved.

Egypt,  Israel,  and  Jordan  will  agree on the modalities for
establishing  elected self-governing authority in the West Bank
and  Gaza.  The  delegations  of  Egypt  and Jordan may include
Palestinians  from the West Bank and Gaza or other Palestinians
as  mutually  agreed.  The  parties will negotiate an agreement
which  will  define  the  powers  and  responsibilities  of the
self-governing  authority  to be exercised in the West Bank and
Gaza.  A withdrawal of Israeli armed forces will take place and
there  will  be  a redeployment of the remaining Israeli forces
into  specified  security  locations.  The  agreement will also
include   arrangements   for  assuring  internal  and  external
security  and public order. A strong local police force will be
established, which may include Jordanian citizens. In addition,
Israeli  and Jordanian forces will participate in joint patrols
and  in  the manning of control posts to assure the security of
the borders.

When  the  self-governing authority (administrative council) in
the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  is established and inaugurated, the
transitional  period  of  five  years  will  begin.  As soon as
possible, but not later than the third year after the beginning
of  the  transitional  period,  negotiations will take place to
determine  the  final  status of the West Bank and Gaza and its
relationship  with its neighbors and to conclude a peace treaty
between  Israel  and  Jordan  by  the  end  of the transitional
period.  These  negotiations  will  be  conducted  among Egypt,
Israel,   Jordan   and   the  elected  representatives  of  the
inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza. Two separate but related
committees  will  be  convened,  one  committee,  consisting of
representatives  of  the  four parties which will negotiate and
agree  on  the  final status of the West Bank and Gaza, and its
relationship  with  its  neighbors,  and  the second committee,
consisting  of representatives of Israel and representatives of
Jordan  to  be  joined  by  the  elected representatives of the
inhabitants  of  the West Bank and Gaza, to negotiate the peace
treaty  between  Israel  and  Jordan,  taking  into account the
agreement  reached  in  the  final  status of the West Bank and
Gaza. The negotiations shall be based on all the provisions and
principles   of   UN   Security  Council  Resolution  242.  The
negotiations will resolve, among other matters, the location of
the boundaries and the nature of the security arrangements. The
solution   from   the  negotiations  must  also  recognize  the
legitimate  right  of  the  Palestinian  peoples and their just
requirements. In this way, the Palestinians will participate in
the determination of their own future through:

The   negotiations   among   Egypt,   Israel,  Jordan  and  the
representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza to
agree  on  the final status of the West Bank and Gaza and other
outstanding  issues  by  the  end  of  the transitional period.
Submitting   their   agreements   to  a  vote  by  the  elected
representatives  of  the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza.
Providing for the elected representatives of the inhabitants of
the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  to  decide  how  they  shall govern
themselves  consistent  with the provisions of their agreement.
Participating  as  stated  above  in  the work of the committee
negotiating the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan.

All  necessary  measures  will  be taken and provisions made to
assure  the  security  of  Israel  and its neighbors during the
transitional  period  and  beyond.  To assist in providing such
security,  a  strong  local police force will be constituted by
the   self-governing   authority.   It   will  be  composed  of
inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza. The police will maintain
liaison  on  internal  security  matters  with  the  designated
Israeli, Jordanian, and Egyptian officers.

During  the  transitional  period,  representatives  of  Egypt,
Israel,   Jordan,   and   the   self-governing  authority  will
constitute a continuing committee to decide by agreement on the
modalities of admission of persons displaced from the West Bank
and  Gaza  in 1967, together with necessary measures to prevent
disruption  and  disorder.  Other matters of common concern may
also be dealt with by this committee.

Egypt  and  Israel  will  work  with  each other and with other
interested parties to establish agreed procedures for a prompt,
just  and  permanent  implementation  of  the resolution of the
refugee problem.

B. Egypt-Israel
---------------
Egypt-Israel  undertake  not to resort to the threat or the use
of  force  to settle disputes. Any disputes shall be settled by
peaceful  means in accordance with the provisions of Article 33
of the U.N. Charter.

n  order  to  achieve  peace between them, the parties agree to
negotiate  in good faith with a goal of concluding within three
months from the signing of the Framework a peace treaty between
them  while  inviting  the  other  parties  to  the conflict to
proceed  simultaneously to negotiate and conclude similar peace
treaties with a view the achieving a comprehensive peace in the
area.  The  Framework  for  the  Conclusion  of  a Peace Treaty
between  Egypt  and  Israel  will govern the peace negotiations
between  them. The parties will agree on the modalities and the
timetable for the implementation of their obligations under the
treaty.

C. Associated Principles
------------------------
Egypt  and  Israel  state  that  the  principles and provisions
described  below  should apply to peace treaties between Israel
and each of its neighbors - Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

Signatories  shall  establish  among  themselves  relationships
normal  to  states at peace with one another. To this end, they
should  undertake  to  abide  by all the provisions of the U.N.
Charter. Steps to be taken in this respect include:

full recognition;

abolishing economic boycotts;

guaranteeing  that under their jurisdiction the citizens of the
other  parties shall enjoy the protection of the due process of
law.

Signatories   should   explore   possibilities   for   economic
development  in  the  context of final peace treaties, with the
objective   of   contributing   to  the  atmosphere  of  peace,
cooperation and friendship which is their common goal.

Claims commissions may be established for the mutual settlement
of all financial claims.

The United States shall be invited to participated in the talks
on  matters  related to the modalities of the implementation of
the  agreements  and working out the timetable for the carrying
out of the obligations of the parties.

The  United  Nations  Security  Council  shall  be requested to
endorse  the  peace  treaties  and ensure that their provisions
shall  not  be  violated. The permanent members of the Security
Council shall be requested to underwrite the peace treaties and
