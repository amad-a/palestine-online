Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
---------------------------------------

Palestine  Liberation  Organization  (PLO)  ,  political  body representing
Palestinian Arabs in their attempt to reclaim their homeland from Israel.

Structure and Organs
--------------------

The  PLO  was founded at a congress in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem in
May 1964 .

It  was  set  up  largely  out  of  Palestinian  notables;  out  of the 388
Palestinians  at  the first PNC, a disproportionately high number were from
the West Bank elite families . It only became an umbrella group for the PRM
in  July  1968, at the 4th PNC, when half the PNC seats went to the PRM and
Fatah  participated  for the 1st time; and more fully at the 6th PNC in Feb
1969, when 70 seats out of the 100 went to the PRM.

Dedicated  to  mobilizing  the  Palestinian people to recover their usurped
homes,   the   organization,   seeks  the  replacement  of  Israel  with  a
non-sectarian  democratic  state.  and has sponsored numerous commando acts
both inside that country and internationally .

The  functions  of  the  PLO  are  carried  out  by  three main organs: the
Executive  Committee  ,  a decision-making body in which the major fedayeen
groups  are represented ; the Central Committee , an advisory body; and the
Palestine National Council, which is seen as an assembly of the Palestinian
people.

History
-------

Since  February 1969 the PLO has been headed by Yasser Arafat, leader of Al
Fatah  .  At  an  Arab  summit  meeting  in  Rabat  , Morocco, in 1974, the
organization  was  recognized  as the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian  people , and Arafat subsequently addressed the United Nations,
where the organization has an observer status.

In 1970 the PLO fought a short , bloody war with the army of Jordan , where
most  of  the  fedayeen  were  then  stationed . Expelled , they settled in
Lebanon  .  Israel's  invasion  of Lebanon in 1982 greatly weakened the PLO
presence  there,  intensified  the  organization's  factional  splits , and
forced  the  dispersion  of some 12,000 PLO members to Syria and other Arab
countries. PLO members loyal to Arafat made their headquarters in Tunis; an
Israeli  bombing  raid in October 1985 severely damaged the main buildings.
In  July  1988,  King  Hussein  of  Jordan ceded to the PLO all territorial
claims to the Israeli-held West Bank .

In November 1988, at a meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers
,  Arafat  declared  the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state
with  Jerusalem  as  its  capital.  The  council  also  voted  to accept UN
resolutions  242  (1967) and 338 (1973), recognizing the sovereignty of all
states  in  the  Middle  East  ,  and to use the resolutions, together with
acknowledgment of the Palestinian right to self-determination, as the basis
for an international peace conference.

The  United  States  agreed  in December 1988 to initiate direct diplomatic
dialogue  with  the  PLO.  Relations with the U.S. and the pro-Western Arab
states  deteriorated  in  1991,however,  as  Arafat publicly supported Iraq
during  the  Persian  Gulf  War.  In  July  the Lebanese army , with Syrian
backing , forced the PLO to abandon its strongholds in southern Lebanon .

In  January  1993  Israel  repealed  its ban on PLO contact by Israelis. In
September  1993,  Arafat and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin agreed to
the  signing  of  an  historic  peace accord that paved the way for limited
Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied territories .</p></pre>

Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine

(PFLP),   Arabic   AL-JABHA   AL-SHA'BIYAH  LI-TAHRIR  FILAsTIN  ,  It  was
established  in  1967  in  an  amalgamation  of three different Palestinian
guerrilla  groups  by  Georges  Habash  .  The PFLP suffered from conflicts
between  its  several  factions,  though  all  were  engaged  in  guerrilla
activities.  The  PFLP  rejected  political  compromise with Israel and was
pledged to the elimination of that state. It took a vigorously anti-Western
and anticapitalist stance on other Middle Eastern questions.

The  PFLP carried out or organized many notorious guerrilla actions against
Israel,  most  notably the hijacking and destruction of airliners to Israel
in the late 1960s and '70s.</p></pre>

Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
------------------------------------------------

(DFLP),  Arabic AL-JABHA AL-DIMUQRATIYAH LI-TAHRIR FILASTIN, one of several
organizations associated with the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has
engaged  in  guerrilla  attacks working to bring a democratic state of Jews
and Arabs free of Zionism and imperialism.

Founded  by  a  Jordanian  Orthodox Christian, Na'if Hawatmeh, In 1969, the
Popular  Democratic  Front  for  the  Liberation  of  Palestine  (as it was
originally  named) was envisioned as a political movement distinct from the
Popular  Front  for the Liberation of Palestine , which had been founded to
provide a front for diverse militant Palestinian groups.

It  was  originally  more  Maoist and pro-China in the 1960s; then from the
early  1970s  became more pro-Soviet and The PFLP has always been much more
tied  to  Arab  communist  and Ba'thist parties, especially the Iraqi Ba'th
through  the  1970s,  and  the  Syrian Ba'th and Libyan pan-Arabists in the
1980s.  The  DFLP  stood  ideologically to the left of the PFLP and claimed
that its enemies were Zionist upper-class imperialists.</p></pre>

passed  legislation  allowing for the closure of PNA offices set up outside
the self-rule areas, notably Orient House in East Jerusalem.

HAMAS (Islamic Resistance Movement)
-----------------------------------

Islamic  organization  ,  Founded  on  August 1988 . Its militant wing, Izz
al-Din al-Qassam unit, played a major role in the Intifada, the Palestinian
uprising  in  the  Israeli-occupied territories. Responsible for attacks on
Israeli  soliders  , the group gained a reputation for unpredictability. It
opposed  the  Sept  1993  peace  accord  between  Israel  and the Palestine
Liberation  Organization  (PLO) and maintained a campaign of attacks within
Israel .

In  Nov  1992  Hamas  formed  an  alliance  with  Iran  for  support in the
continuation  of  the  Intifada. In Dec 1992, 415 Palestinians suspected of
having  links  with  Hamas were expelled from Israel in to Lebanon. Refused
refugee  status by Lebanon and neighbouring Arab states , they remained for
six   months   in  a  on  Marj  al-Zahour,  a  mountain  slope  camp  until
international  condemnation  of  the deportations forced Israel to agree to
their return.

Its  militant  wing, Al Qassam, claimed responsibility for two bomb attacks
within  Israel April 1994 , in which 12 died, and for a further bus bombing
in  Tel  Aviv  Oct  1994,  in  which  21 Israelis and 1 Dutch national were
killed.  All  were  carried  out by martyr  bombers. In Nov 1994 there were
clashes  between  supporters  of  Hamas  and  Palestinian  police  in newly
liberated  Gaza, the police shot 16 of them outside the Palestine Mosque in
Gaza ('Black Friday')..

In  1989  Hamas'  leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was arrested by the Israelis
and sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the killing of Palestinians
who had allegedly collaborated with the Israeli army. he's been released on
1 October 1997, in a trade off with Jordan for 2 Israeli agents.</p></pre>

INTIFADA
--------

Palestinian  uprising,  a  group  of  adult and teenage Palestinians active
1987-93  in  attacks on armed Israeli troops in the occupied territories of
Palestine.  Their  campaign  for self-determination included stone-throwing
and petrol bombing.

The uprising began Dec 1987 in the Gaza Strip. Rumours that a fatal traffic
collision had been caused by Israeli security service agents in retaliation
for  the  stabbing of an Israeli the previous week led to demonstrations by
teenagers  armed  with slingshots. It subsequently spread, despite attempts
at  repression.  Some 1,300 Palestinians and 80 Israelis were killed in the
uprising  up  to  the  end  of  1991.  Many  Palestinian private homes were
dynamited   by  military  order,  under  a  still-valid  British  emergency
regulation of 1946 . The number of soldiers on duty on the West Bank at the
beginning of 1989 was said to be more than three times the number needed to
conquer it during the Six-Day War.

The   1993  peace  accord  between  Israel  and  the  Palestine  Liberation
Organization  effectively  liberated  the  occupied territories of Gaza and
Jericho.  However  ,  Islamic groups that had participated in the Intifada,
notably  the  militant  wing of the Hamas islamic group, opposed the accord
and continued a campaign of attackes within Israel.</p></pre>

Al-Husayni, Amin
----------------

Also  called  AL-HAJJ  AMIN  (born 1897, Jerusalem, Palestine, - d. July 4,
1974,  Beirut, Lebanon), Mufti of Jerusalem and Arab nationalist figure who
played  a  major  role in Arab resistance to Zionist political ambitions in
Palestine.

Husayni  studied  in  Jerusalem,  Cairo,  and  Istanbul, and in 1910 he was
commissioned in the Turkish artillery. He became a strong voice in the Arab
nationalist  and  anti-Zionist  movements. In Jan 1922 the British, who had
accepted a mandate for Palestine after World War I, named Husayni permanent
president  and  mufti  of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council the most
authoritative religious body in the Palestinian Muslim community.

In  1936  all the Palestinian groups joined to create a permanent executive
organ  known  as  the Arab High Committee under Husayni's chairmanship. The
committee  demanded  a cessation of Jewish immigration and a prohibition of
land  transfers  from  Arabs  to  Jews.  A  general strike developed into a
rebellion  against  British authority. The British removed Husayni from the
council  presidency  and  declared  the  committee illegal in Palestine. In
October 1937 he fled to Lebanon, where he reconstituted the committee under
his domination.

The  rebellion  forced  Britain  to  make  substantial  concessions to Arab
demands  in  1939. The British abandoned the idea of establishing Palestine
as  a  Jewish  state,  and,  while  Jewish  immigration was to continue for
another  five  years, it was thereafter to depend on Arab consent. Husayni,
however, felt that the concessions did not go far enough, and he repudiated
the new policy.

Ceasing  to  play an active role in Palestinian affairs, Husayni spent most
of World War II (1939-45) in Germany. At the war's end he fled to Egypt.</p></pre>

By name ABU JIHAD (born Oct. 10, 1935, Ramla, Palestine -d. April 16, 1988,
Tunis,  Tunisia),  Palestinian  leader  who was believed to be the military
strategist  and  second in command of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO).

Wazir  fled  with his family during the 1948 war that followed the creation
of  the  state  of  Israel,  and he grew up in the Gaza Strip, where he was
educated  by  the  United  Nations  Relief  and Works Agency. He met Yasser
Arafat  in  1951  while  attending  college  in  Cairo  , and together they
organized   anti-Israel   guerrilla   actions   and  founded  the  militant
organization Fatah (1958), which joined the PLO (1968). As 'Arafat's deputy
and  a moderate within the PLO, Wazir often maintained diplomatic relations
with  other  countries,  and  reportedly  planned  military  strategies and
arranged  arms  purchases for Fatah and the PLO. After the PLO was expelled
from  Jordan  in  1971, he remained in Amman as an unofficial contact there
until  he  in turn was expelled in 1986. He was assassinated in his home by
unidentified commandos; Israel later officially acknowledged involvement.</p></pre>

Habash, Georges
---------------

(born  1925,  Lydda,  Palestine),  Palestinian politician and leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

Habash  fled  Palestine in 1948 and earned a medical degree at the American
University  in  Beirut.  In  the early 1950s he was active in the "Youth of
Vengeance"  group, which advocated attacks on traditional Arab governments.
Habash  founded  the militant PFLP after his goal to destroy Israel through
Arab  unity proved unrealistic following the Arab nations' defeat by Israel
in  the  Six-Day  War  of 1967. Under the leadership of Habash, the Popular
Front  staged  several  airplane  hijackings,  including that of a U.S. jet
blown  up  in  September  1970, which triggered King Hussein's crackdown on
Palestinian guerrillas in Jordan.

Habash,  a Marxist, visited China in 1970, finding Chinese leaders critical
of  the  PFLP's  "foreign  operations,"  and  Moscow in 1972. Following the
October  War  of  1973,  Habash  became the leading voice of the "Rejection
Front,"  four  Palestinian  groups who opposed any diplomatic settlement to
the  conflict  with  Israel.  He  attacked  the "defeatist" attitude of the
Palestine   Liberation   Organization's   leadership,   whose  attempts  at
reconciliation   with   King  Hussein  he  sharply  criticized.  Under  his
leadership  the  PFLP  successfully  organized  clandestine  cells  in  the
Israeli-occupied  West  Bank  and  Gaza.  Habash  was the target of several
assassination attempts, one of which partially paralyzed him.</p></pre>

The   Palestinian  diplomat  and  negotiator  Hanan  Ashrawi,  b.  1946,  a
university  professor and mother of two young daughters , she was chosen in
1991  to  represent  the  Palestinian  Liberation Organization (PLO) in the
Middle  East peace talks convened in Madrid in October. Her masterly use of
spoken  English  and  her cool, pragmatic, Western-style negotiating skills
won the admiration even of her Israeli adversaries in the talks that led in
December  1993  to an agreement for the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces
from the Palestinian West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Ashrawi  was born in Ramallah, Palestine, the youngest of five daughters of
a  Palestinian  physician and political leader. A Christian, she studied in
Christian schools and at the American University in Beirut, Lebanon, before
earning a doctorate at the University of Virginia in the United States. She
and her husband, a professional photographer and musician, chose to live in
the  Occupied  West  Bank,  where  she  became  a professor of medieval and
comparative literature at Bir Zeit University.

In  the  ferment of the Palestinian liberation movement, Ashrawi joined the
PLO  Fatah  faction,  which,  together  with  her  eloquence  and lucidity,
recommended  her to all sides in the Middle East negotiations. She attended
the  peace  talks  throughout  the  opening  session  in Madrid until their
successful conclusion in December 1993, when she resigned to head the PLO's
mission  in Washington, D.C. As the Israeli withdrawals began, she returned
to  her  teaching  responsibilities  in  Bir  Zeit,  where  she  headed the
Palestinian  Independent  Commission on Civil Rights, concerned among other
things  with  preventing  reprisals against Palestinians who had cooperated
with the Israelis during the occupation. In January 1996 she was elected to
a seat on the Palestinian Council, representing East Jerusalem.</p></pre>
