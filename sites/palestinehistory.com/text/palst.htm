Palestine
---------

Palestine  -  the  land  of  the Prophets. Rich in history - the history of
generations  of  believers  who  lived  and worshipped, and fought and died
there, praising their Lord and defending their faith.

Historic  region,  the  extent  of  which  has varied greatly since ancient
times, situated on the E coast of the Mediterranean Sea, in SW Asia .

The  Land
---------

The  region has an extremely diverse terrain that falls generally into four
parallel  zones.  From  W  to  E they are the coastal plain ; the hills and
mountains  of Galilee, Samaria, and Judea; the valley of the Jordan R.; and
the  E  plateau.  In  the extreme S lies the Negev , a rugged desert area .
Elevations  range from 395 m (1296 ft) below sea level on the shores of the
Dead Sea, the lowest point on the surface of the earth, to 1020 m (3347 ft)
atop nearby Mt. Hebron .

The  region  has  several  fertile  areas  , which constitute its principal
natural  resource  .  The  water  supply  of  the  region, however , is not
abundant  ,  with virtually all of the modest annual rainfall coming in the
winter  months  . The Jordan Rever, the region's only major stream, flows S
through  Lake  Tiberias  (the  regions  only  large freshwater lake) to the
intensely saline Dead Sea.

History
-------

3'RD MILLENNIUM BC
------------------

3'rd  millennium BC : The Canaanites were the earliest known inhabitants of
Palestine. They became urbanized and lived in city-states, one of which was
Jericho . They developed an alphabet. Palestine's location at the center of
routes linking three continents made it the meeting place for religious and
cultural  influences from Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor. It was
also  the  natural  battleground  for  the  great  powers of the region and
subject  to  domination by adjacent empires, beginning with Egypt in the 3d
millennium BC.


2'ND MILLENNIUM BC
------------------

2'rd  millennium  BC  :  Egyptian  hegemony  and  Canaanite  autonomy  were
constantly  challenged by such ethnically diverse invaders as the Amorites,
Hittites,  and  Hurrians.  These  invaders,  however,  were defeated by the
Egyptians  and  absorbed  by  the  Canaanites,  who  at  that time may have
numbered about 200000.

14th  century  BC  : Egyptian power began to weaken, new invaders appeared:
the   Hebrews,  a  group  of  Semitic  tribes  from  Mesopotamia,  and  the
Philistines  (after  whom the country was later named), an Aegean people of
Indo-European stock.

1230  BC  :  Joshua conquered parts of Palestine. The conquerors settled in
the hill country, but they were unable to conquer all of Palestine.

1125  BC  :  The  Israelites,  a  confederation  of  Hebrew tribes, finally
defeated  the  Canaanites  but found the struggle with the Philistines more
difficult  .  Philistines  had  established  an  independent  state  on the
southern coast of Palestine and controlled the Canaanite town of Jerusalem.

1050  BC  :  Philistines  with  there superior in military organization and
using iron weapons, they severely defeated the Israelites about 1050 BC .


1'ST MILLENNIUM BC
------------------

1000 BC : David, Israel's great king, finally defeated the Philistines, and
they  eventually  assimilated with the Canaanites . The unity of Israel and
the  feebleness  of  adjacent  empires  enabled  David to establish a large
independent state, with its capital at Jerusalem.

922 BC : Under David's son and successor, Solomon, Israel enjoyed peace and
prosperity , but at his death in 922 BC the kingdom was divided into Israel
in the north and Judah in the south .

722-721  BC  :  When  nearby  empires  resumed their expansion, the divided
Israelites  could  no  longer  maintain their independence . Israel fell to
Assyria.

586  BC  :  Judah was conquered by Babylonia, which destroyed Jerusalem and
exiled most of the Jews living there. Nebuchadnezzar entered Jerusalem. The
Temple  was  sacked  and  set  fire  to, and razed to the ground. The Royal
Palace  and all the great houses were destroyed, the population carried off
in chains to Babylon. And they lamented on their long march into exile.

539 BC : Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylonia and he permitted the
Jews  to  return  to Judea, a district of Palestine. Under Persian rule the
Jews  were  allowed  considerable  autonomy.  They  rebuilt  the  walls  of
Jerusalem  and codified the Mosaic law, the Torah, which became the code of
social  life  and  religious observance. The Jews were bound to a universal
God.

333  BC  :  Persian domination of Palestine was replaced by Greek rule when
Alexander  the  Great of Macedonia took the region. Alexander's successors,
the  Ptolemies  of Egypt and the Seleucids of Syria , continued to rule the
country  .  The  Seleucids  tried to impose Hellenistic (Greek) culture and
religion on the population.

141-63  BC  :  Jews  revolted under the Maccabees and set up an independent
state.

132-35 BC : Jews revolts erupted, numerous Jews were killed, many were sold
into  slavery,  and the rest were not allowed to visit Jerusalem. Judea was
renamed Syria Palaistina.

63  BC  : Jerusalem was overrun by Rome. Herod was appointed King of Judea.
He  slaughtered the last of the Hasmoneans and ordered a lavish restoration
and  extension  of  the  Second  Temple.  A  period of great civil disorder
followed  with  strife between pacifists and Zealots, and riots against the
Roman authorities.

37-4  BC : During the rule of King Herod the Great Jesus of Nazareth, peace
be  upon  him was born. And years after, he began his teaching mission. His
attempts  to  call  people  back to the pure teachings of Abraham and Moses
were  judged  subversive  by the authorities. He was tried and sentenced to
death;  "yet  they  did  not slay him but only a likeness that was shown to
them."


1-999 AD
--------

70 AD : Titus of Rome laid siege to Jerusalem. The fiercely defended Temple
eventually  fell,  and  with  it  the  whole  city.  Seeking a complete and
enduring  victory,  Titus  ordered  the  total  destruction of the Herodian
Temple.  A  new  city  named  Aelia was built by the Romans on the ruins of
Jerusalem, and a temple dedicated to Jupitor raised up.

313  AD  :  Palestine  received  special  attention  when the Roman emperor
Constantine   I   legalized   Christianity.  His  mother,  Helena,  visited
Jerusalem,  and  Palestine,  as  the Holy Land, became a focus of Christian
pilgrimage.  A  golden  age  of prosperity, security, and culture followed.
Most of the population became Hellenized and Christianized .

324  AD  :  Constantine  of Byzantium marched on Aelia. He rebuilt the city
walls  and  commissioned  the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and opened the
city for Christian pilgrimage.

29-614  AD  : Byzantine (Roman) rule was interrupted , however , by a brief
Persian  occupation  and  ended  altogether when Muslim Arab armies invaded
Palestine and captured Jerusalem in AD 638 .

638 AD : The Arab conquest began 1300 years of Muslim presence in what then
became  known as Filastin. Eager to be rid of their Byzantine overlords and
aware  of their shared heritage with the Arabs, the descendants of Ishmael,
as  well as the Muslims reputation for mercy and compassion in victory, the
people  of  Jerusalem  handed  over the city after a brief siege. They made
only  one  condition,  That  the  terms  of  their  surrender be negotiated
directly  with the Khalif 'Umar in person. 'Umar entered Jerusalem on foot.
There  was no bloodshed. There were no massacres. Those who wanted to leave
were  allowed  to,  with  all  their  goods.  Those who wanted to stay were
guarantee protection for their lives, their property and places of worship.

Palestine  was  holy to Muslims because the Prophet Muhammad had designated
Jerusalem  as the first qibla (the direction Muslims face when praying) and
because  he was believed to have ascended on a night journey to heaven from
the  the  old  city of Jerusalem (al-Aqsa Mosque today) , where the Dome of
the Rock was later built. Jerusalem became the third holiest city of Islam.
The  Muslim  rulers  did  not force their religion on the Palestinians, and
more  than  a  century  passed  before the majority converted to Islam. The
remaining Christians and Jews were considered People of the Book. They were
allowed autonomous control in their communities and guaranteed security and
freedom  of  worship.  Such tolerance was rare in the history of religion .
Most  Palestinians  also  adopted  Arabic  and  Islamic  culture. Palestine
benefited from the empires trade and from its religious significance during
the first Muslim dynasty, the Umayyads of Damascus.

750  AD  : The power shifted to Baghdad with the Abbasids, Palestine became
neglected.  It  suffered  unrest  and  successive  domination  by  Seljuks,
Fatimids,  and  European  Crusaders.  It  shared,  however, in the glory of
Muslim civilization, when the Muslim world enjoyed a golden age of science,
art, philosophy, and literature. Muslims preserved Greek learning and broke
new  ground  in  several  fields,  all  of  which  later contributed to the
Renaissance  in  Europe.  Like  the  rest of the empire, however, Palestine
under the Mamelukes gradually stagnated and declined.


1000-1899 AD
------------

1517  AD : The Ottoman Turks of Asia Minor defeated the Mamelukes, with few
interruptions, ruled Palestine until the winter of 1917-18. The country was
divided  into  several  districts (sanjaks), such as that of Jerusalem. The
administration  of  the  districts  was placed largely in the hands of Arab
Palestinians,  who  were  descendants  of the Canaanites. The Christian and
Jewish  communities,  however,  were  allowed  a large measure of autonomy.
Palestine  shared  in  the  glory  of  the  Ottoman  Empire during the 16th
century,  but  declined  again when the empire began to decline in the 17th
century.

1831-1840 AD : Muhammad Ali, the modernizing viceroy of Egypt, expanded his
rule  to  Palestine  .  His  policies  modified the feudal order, increased
agriculture, and improved education.

1840  The  Ottoman  Empire  reasserted  its  authority, instituting its own
reforms .

1845  Jewish  in  Palestine  were  12,000  increased to 85,000 by 1914. All
people in Palestine were Arabic Muslims and Christians.

1897  the  first Zionist Congress held Basle, Switzerland, issued the Basle
programme on the colonization of Palestine.


Breif modern history of Palestine
---------------------------------

Aided  by  the Arabs, the British captured Palestine from the Ottoman Turks
in  1917-18.  The  Arabs revolted against the Turks because the British had
promised  them,  in correspondence (1915-16) with Shareef Husein ibn Ali of
Mecca  (1856-1931),  the  independence  of  their countries after the war .
Britain  ,  however, also made other, conflicting commitments in the secret
Sykes -Picot agreement with France and Russia (1916), it promised to divide
and  rule  the  region with its allies . In a third agreement , the Balfour
Declaration  of 1917, Britain promised the Jews a Jewish "national home" in
Palestine .

This  promise  was  subsequently  incorporated  in the mandate conferred on
Britain  by  the League of Nations in 1922 . During their mandate (1922-48)
the   British   found  their  contradictory  promises  to  the  Jewish  and
Palestinian  communities  difficult  to  reconcile.  The Zionists envisaged
large-scale  Jewish  immigration  ,  and  some  spoke  of  a  Jewish  state
constituting  all of Palestine . Palestinians , however, rejected Britain's
right to promise their country to a third party and feared dispossession by
the  Zionists;  anti-Zionist attacks occurred in Jerusalem (1920) and Jaffa
(1921).

A  1922  statement  of  British  policy  denied  Zionist  claims  to all of
Palestine  and  limited  Jewish  immigration , but reaffirmed support for a
Jewish  national home. British proposed establishing a legislative council,
Palestinians rejected this council as discriminatory.

After  1928,  when Jewish immigration increased somewhat, British policy on
the  subject seesawed under conflicting Arab-Jewish pressures . Immigration
rose  sharply  after the installation (1933) of the Nazi regime in Germany;
in 1935 nearly 62,000 Jews entered Palestine.

Fear  of  Jewish domination was the principal cause of the Arab revolt that
broke  out  in  1936  and continued intermittently until 1939. By that time
Britain had again restricted Jewish immigration and purchases of land .

The  struggle  for  Palestine, which abated during World War II, resumed in
1945  .  The  horrors of the Holocaust produced world sympathy for European
Jews  and for Zionism , and although Britain still refused to admit 100,000
Jewish to Palestine , many Jewish found their way there illegally .

Various  plans for solving the Palestine problem were rejected by one party
or  the  other . Britain finally declared the mandate unworkable and turned
the  problem  over  to  the UN in April 1947. The Jews and the Palestinians
prepared  for  a  showdown . Although the Palestinians outnumbered the Jews
(1300000  to  600000),  the  latter  were  better  prepared  .  They  had a
semiautonomous  government,  led  by David Ben-Gurion , and their military,
the  Haganah,  was  well trained and experienced . The Palestinians, on the
other  hand,  had  never recovered from the Arab revolt , and most of their
leaders were in exile .

The  Mufti  of  Jerusalem  ,  their  principal spokesman, refused to accept
Jewish statehood . When UN proposed partition in November 1947, he rejected
the  plan  while  the  Jews  accepted  it  .  In the military struggle that
followed, the Palestinians were defeated . Violance was used on both sides.

Israel was established on May 14,1948. Five Arab armies , coming to the aid
of   the   Palestinians   ,  immediately  attacked  it.  Uncoordinated  and
outnumbered,  they  were  defeated  by  Israeli forces. Israel enlarged its
territory  .  Jordan took the West Bank of the Jordan River, and Egypt took
the  Gaza  Strip.  (  Israel  occupied these lands after the Six Day War of
1967.  ) The war produced 780,000 Palestinian refugees. About half probably
left  out  of  fear and panic , while the rest were forced out to make room
for Jewish immigrants from Europe and from the Arab world. The Palestinians
spread  throughout  the  neighboring  countries, where they have maintained
their  Palestinian  national  identity  and  the  desire to return to their
homeland.</p></pre>
