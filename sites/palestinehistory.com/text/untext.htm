<pre><p align=center>Arab-Israeli  conflicts  have presented the United Nations with some of its
most difficult peace keeping problems.

In  1947,  the  General Assembly approved a plan to divide Palestine into a
Jewish  state and an Arab state and to make Jerusalem an international city
under UN control.

Jerusalem is a holy city for Christians, and Muslims.

About 90 percent of all Arabs are Muslims, and the land given to Jewish was
more then Arab, The Arab countries opposed the UN plan .</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>On 14 May 1948, the United Kingdom relinquished its mandate over Palestine.
Israel  was  proclaimed.  On  the following day, the Palestinians, together
with  the  armies  of  Syria,  Lebanon,  Egypt and Jordan, attacked the the
proclaimed  Israel  , The Arabs failed to prevent establishment of a Jewish
state.

In  1949,  the war ended with four UN-arranged armistice agreements between
Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. .

The  United  Nations  Truce  Supervision  Organization (UNTSO) assisted the
parties  in  complying  with  the  provisions of these agreements. However,
border incidents continued.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>Following  the  nationalization  of the Suez Canal announced by Egypt on 26
July  1956,  Israeli  forces invaded Sinai, while British and French troops
landed at Suez at the end of October.

On  4  November  1956,  the  General  Assembly, meeting in special session,
called  for  a  cease-fire  and  created the first peace-keeping force, the
United  Nations  Emergency  Force  (UNEF), which supervised the progressive
withdrawal  of  the  Israeli,  British  and  French  troops,  patrolled the
demarcation  line  between  Egypt and Israel, and brought relative quiet to
the area.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>UNEF was withdrawn at Egypt’s request on 16 May 1967.

On  5  June, war broke out again between Israel on the one hand, and Egypt,
Jordan and Syria on the other. The Security Council called four times for a
cease-fire, which was eventually concluded on 11 June. At that date, Israel
occupied Sinai, the Gaza strip, the West Bank of the Jordan, including East
Jerusalem,  and  part of the Syrian Golan Heights.The Security Council sent
observers to monitor the cease-fire.

On  22 November 1967, the Council unanimously adopted resolution 242, which
laid down the general principles for a peaceful and lasting settlement; the
withdrawal  of  Israeli  armed forces from territories occupied in the most
recent conflict; the termination of all claims or states of belligerency.

Respect  for  and recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political  independence  of  every state in the area; the guarantee of free
navigation   through   international   waterways   in  the  area;  and  the
establishment of demilitarized zones.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>In 1974, the General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing the right of
Palestine  Arabs,  including  those  in  Israel,  to  nationhood.  A second
resolution  gave  observer  status to the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO),  a  group  approved by Arab countries to represent the Palestinians.
Observer  status gave the PLO the right to attend Assembly sessions but not
to take part in them.</p></pre>

<pre><p align=center>In 1975, many Western nations were angered when the General Assembly passed
a  resolution  declaring that Zionism is "a form of racism." Zionism is the
Jewish  movement  that  helped  establish the state of Israel. The Assembly
repealed the resolution in 1991.</p></pre>

In  1993  and  1995,  Israel  and the PLO signed agreements that led to the
withdrawal  of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and most cities and towns
of  the  West  Bank  by  early 1996. As the Israelis withdrew, Palestinians
became the governing authorities in these areas. Israel also recognized the
PLO  as  the  representative of the Palestinian people. In 1994, Jordan and
Israel  signed a declaration that marked the end of a state of war that had
technically  existed  between them since 1948. In 1996, Palestinians in the
Gaza  Strip  and  Palestinian-controlled  parts  of the West Bank elected a
president and legislature to make laws and administer these areas.</p></pre>
