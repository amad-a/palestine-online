UN Resolution 465
-----------------

1.Affirming   once  more  that  the  fourth  Geneva  convention

of  12  August  1949  is  applicable  to  the  Arab territories
occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem.

physical   character,  demographic  composition,  institutional
structure   of   status  of  the  Palestinian  and  other  Arab
territories  occupied  since  1967, including Jerusalem, or any
part  thereof,  have no legal validity and that Israel's policy
and  practices  of  setting  parts  of  its  population and new
Immigrants in those territories constitute a flagrant violation
of  the  fourth Geneva convention relative to the protection of
civilian  persons  in time of war and also constitute a serious
obstruction  to  achieving  a  comprehensive,  just and lasting
peace in the Middle East.

3.Strongly  deplores the continuation and persistence of Israel
in  pursuing  those  policies  and practices and calls upon the
government  and  people of Israel to rescind those measures, to
dismantle  the existing settlements and in particular to cease,
on   an  urgent  basis,  the  establishment,  construction  and
planning  of settlements in the Arab territories occupied since
1967, including Jerusalem.

4.Calls  upon  all  states  not  to  provide  Israel  with  any
assistance   to   be   used  specifically  in  connection  with
settlements in the Occupied Territories.

5.Requests  the commission to continue to examine the situation
relating  to  the  settlements in the Arab territories occupied
since  1967,  including  Jerusalem, to investigate the reported
serious  depletion of natural resources, particularly the water
resources,  with  a  view  to  ensuring the protection of those
important   natural   resources   of   the   territories  under
occupation, and keep under close scrutiny the implementation of
the present resolution.

The Security Council,

1.Expresses  its  grave concern over the rejection by Israel of
Security Council resolutions 672 and 673.

deportations   of   Palestinian   civilians   in  the  occupied
territories.

applicability  of  the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, to all
the  territories  occupied  by  Israel since 1967, and to abide
scrupulously by the provisions of the said convention.

4.Calls   on   the  high  contracting  parties  to  the  Geneva
Convention  to  ensure  respect  by  Israel for its obligations
under the convention.

5.Requests  the  Secretary  General,  in  co-operation with the
International Committee of the Red Cross to develop further the
idea  from  his  report  of  convening  a  meeting  of the high
contracting parties, to discuss possible measures that might be
taken by them under the convention.

6.Requests  the  Secretary  General  to monitor and observe the
situation   regarding   Palestinian   civilians  under  Israeli
occupation,  making  new  efforts  in  this regard on an urgent
basis,  and  to  utilize  and designate or draw upon the United
Nations  and other personnel and resources present there in the
area  and  elsewhere  to  accomplish this task, and to keep the
Security Council regularly informed.

7.Requests  further  the  Secretary  General  to submit a first
progress  report  to  the Security Council by the first week of
March, 1991, and every four months thereafter.'


President's statement:

The   members   of   the   Security   Council   reaffirm  their
determination to support an active negotiating process in which
all   relevant   parties   would   participate   leading  to  a
comprehensive,  just  and  lasting  peace  to  the Arab-Israeli
conflict.  In  this  context  they  agree that an international
conference  should  facilitate  efforts to achieve a negotiated
settlement.

However,  the members of the council are of the view that there
is  not  unanimity as to when would be the appropriate time for
such a conference.

In  the  view  of the members of the council, the Arab- Israeli
conflict   is  important  and  unique  and  must  be  addressed
independently on its own merits.
