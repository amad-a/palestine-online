<p align=center>Excavations  at ancient Jericho, identified as Tell al-Sultan, 10 km (6 mi)
north  of  the  Dead  Sea  ,  have  revealed remains of the oldest city yet
discovered  by  archaeologists. The earliest occupation of the site, dating
from  the  10th  millennium BC, consists of remains of the NATUFIAN culture
and  includes what may have been a shrine. During the 8th millennium BC the
site  was  greatly  expanded  under  a  culture  known  as the Aceramic, or
Prepottery  Neolithic  , and a wall standing 5.2 m (17 ft) high was erected
around  the  settlement  .  On  the west side were found remains of a round
tower that stood 7 m (23 ft) high and included an internal flight of steps.

Following  a  break  the  next city was populated by a culture known as the
Prepottery  Neolithic  (7th - 6th millennium BC). Houses of this phase were
rectangular  and  had beaten earth floors . That the two cultures represent
different  groups is shown by significant changes in both the architectural
tradition  and  in  the  flint  tools.  Extraordinary  finds of this period
included  plastered  skulls  with  shells replacing the eyes. These skulls,
found beneath the floors of houses .

In  the ceramic stage of the Neolithic (6th-4th millennium BC) the dwellers
lived in pits and produced a characteristic painted pottery .

Early  Bronze  Age occupation (3100-2100 BC) was extensive and consisted of
large  ,  well-built homes. Tombs were constructed for mass burials, and in
one  such grave about 100 skulls were counted. Following the destruction of
the  Early Bronze Age settlement, occupation was resumed by people who have
been  identified  with  the  AMORITES.  They  did  not  build  a  permanent
settlement and buried their dead in shaft tombs, the variety of whose grave
deposits may indicate tribal differences.

During  the  Middle  Bronze Age (c.1900-1550 BC) houses consisting of small
irregularly  shaped  rooms  were  built.  Mass  burials were excavated in a
cemetery  off  the  mound  in  shaft graves . The remains of wooden beds on
which the deceased lay as well as pottery vessels containing food and drink
have  been  found  next  to  several of the bodies. The city was destroyed,
probably about the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1550BC).</p></pre>
