employee  or  agent  who  acted  beyond the scope of the powers
assigned to him or her, unlawfully or with willful malfeasance,
the    Palestinian   Authority   shall   not   bear   financial
responsibility.

transfer the proceedings to a ocal court or tribunal.

has been brought in a local court or tribunal subsequent to the
dismissal  of the claim pursuant to subparagraph 1.g above, the
Palestinian  Authority  shall defend it and, in accordance with
subparagraph  1.a above, in the event that an award is made for
the plaintiff, shall pay the amount of the award.

such claims.

provide  the  Palestinian  Authority  with the legal assistance
necessary to bring such proceedings.

b.  The  Palestinian  Authority may collect any taxes due under
Annexes  V  and  VI  on  the date of the transfer of powers and
responsibilities  in  respect  of these taxes, and shall assume
responsibility for the payment of any rebates or refunds.

3.  Subject  to the provisions of this Article, the transfer of
powers  and responsibilities in itself shall not affect rights,
liabilities  and  obligations of any person or legal entity, in
existence at the date of signing of this Agreement.

who will promptly begin the process of becoming acquainted with
the  current  budget  issues.  On  the  date of the transfer of

personnel  will  assume responsibility for all accounts, assets
and records on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.

3.  Israel  shall  continue  to provide the services of Israeli
experts  currently employed in the fields of income tax and VAT

the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, scheduled for September 8 through
10, 1994 in Paris, with a request to finance the shortfall that
may  be  created  in the collection of the direct taxes and the
VAT  during  the initial period while the Palestinian Authority
establishes its own revenue collection system.

6.  The  two sides will meet no later than three days after the
conclusion  of these meetings in order to decide on the date of
transfer  of  powers  and  responsibilities  in  the  remaining
Spheres,  based,  among  other  things,  on the response of the
donor countries to the joint request.

the donor countries.

9.  If  actual  revenues  from the Spheres, including the donor
contributions,  exceed  the budgeted revenues, the excess shall
be applied to development of the Spheres.

10.  The  inclusion  of  the sphere of VAT in the spheres to be
transferred  to  the Palestinian Authority shall constitute the
adjustment referred to in paragraph (3) of the Agreed Minute to
Article  VI(2) of the Declaration of Principles, and no further
adjustment shall be required.


Article XII : Mutual Contribution to Peace and Reconciliation
-------------------------------------------------------------

agreement between the Parties.

3.  Nothing  in  this  Agreement shall prejudice or preempt the
outcome  of the negotiations on the Interim Agreement or on the
permanent status to be conducted pursuant to the Declaration of
Principles.  Neither Party shall be deemed, by virtue of having
entered into this Agreement, to have renounced or waived any of
its existing rights, claims or positions.

single  territorial  unit,  the  integrity  of  which  will  be
preserved during the interim period.

integral  part  of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The status

patients  and medical staff and will act with a view to prevent
any damage to medical installations or equipment.

4.   The   transfer  of  powers  and  responsibilities  to  the
Palestinian  Authority shall not affect the authority of Israel
and  of  the  Israeli  military  government in the West Bank to
exercise  its  powers and responsibilities in criminal matters,
such  as  the  performance  of  autopsies, the investigation of
narcotic offenses, etc.

5.   The   Palestinian   Authority   shall   inform  the  Civil
Administration   in  a  routine  manner  of  births  or  deaths
occurring   within   the   medical   institutions   under   its
