checkpoint near the West Bank town of Hebron Tuesday, a Palestinian doctor
and Israeli security sources said. Israeli military sources claims the
Palestinians driving a vehicle had tried to run down troops manning the
checkpoint. "The Palestinian car came and tried to hit a soldier at the

in the West Bank town of Hebron Wednesday to protest the killing of three

reinforced following the violent protests of recent days. Hundreds of
additional police were on duty in Jerusalem.<br><br>
13.03.1998 , Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat sought to calm the West Bank and vowed to work toward peace.
Netanyahu, in an interview with Israel Television's Arabic service, called
the killings at an Israeli military checkpoint a "tragic mistake" and

the tensions would not affect peace moves.
</p><a name="14mar98"></a><p>
14.03.1998 , At least seven Palestinians were wounded in clashes Friday
between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank
town of Hebron, witnesses said. The violence flared hours after a bomb went
off near Jerusalem's Old City, wounding four Palestinians fanning more
tension following violent clashes over the killings this week of three
Palestinian workers by Israeli troops. The witnesses said armed settlers
threw stones at homes of Palestinians and beat Arabs in a neighborhood in
the Israeli-controlled part of the town, injuring at least two
Palestinians.

17.03.1998 , Israel and Britain agreed Monday that British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook will visit a controversial Jewish settlement project
in Arab East Jerusalem accompanied by an Israeli, not Palestinian,
delegation. "He's going to visit now...," Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's aide said. Israel had earlier threatened to exclude the
European Union from Middle East peacemaking if Cook went ahead with the
visit to Har Homa settlement on a site at the edge of East Jerusalem known
in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
</p><a name="18mar98"></a><p>
18.03.1998 , Israeli opposition leaders say Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu made a mistake by turning British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's
meeting with a Palestinian official at a disputed housing project into a
diplomatic incident. Cook was snubbed by Netanyahu after the meeting. The
prime minister called off a scheduled dinner and a joint press conference.
Labor leaders Haim Ramon and Yossi Beilin criticized Netanyahu's actions
before meeting Cook for breakfast. Cook is now in Syria.
</p><a name="19mar98"></a><p>
19.03.1998 , British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook completed his tour of the
Mideast on Wednesday by calling on Israel to honor a 20-year-old U.N.
resolution demanding its withdrawal from Lebanon. Cook flew to Beirut from
Damascus, Syria, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, which called on the Israelis to leave Lebanon.

holds an enclave in the southern part of the country.<br><br>
19.03.1998 , Israel called a halt Wednesday to a diplomatic dispute over a
hotly contested visit by British Foreign Secretary of State Robin Cook to
the site of a Jewish settlement project in Jerusalem. "I think we can go on
from here and put things behind us," a senior aide to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said. Britain's embassy to Israel in Tel Aviv sounded a
similar note. Cook infuriated Netanyahu Tuesday by surveying the building
site on the edge of Arab East Jerusalem, known in Hebrew as Har Homa and as
Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic, to show EU disapproval of Jewish settlement
expansion on occupied land.
</p><a name="20mar98"></a><p>
20.03.1998 , Israel said Thursday the United States had offered ideas for
breaking a year-old deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking and an
Israeli newspaper said Washington might go public with them as early as
next week. Ha'aretz newspaper said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright would invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to separate meetings in Europe, where
she would explain the plan before publicizing it, to try to get them to
accept it. In Cairo, visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he had
no plans to offer an alternative to U.S. peace-brooking in the region.
</p><a name="23mar98"></a><p>
23.03.1998 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet
ministers are in unanimous opposition to a reported U.S. proposal calling
for Israel to withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. This figure
which has been mentioned in the news media, "13 percent, is unacceptable,
and ... damaging to the security interests of the State of Israel," Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh told reporters.
</p><a name="24mar98"></a><p>
24.03.1998 , A representative of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said on Tuesday that Israel could relinquish control of no more than a
further nine percent of the West Bank, less then a new American initiative
that reportedly sought a 13 percent pullback. Netanyahu said on Monday
Israel alone would determine the extent of a long-delayed West Bank
pullback based on its security needs.
</p><a name="27mar98"></a><p>
27.03.1998 , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday rejected a U.S.
proposal for Israeli soldiers to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
Israel is reportedly willing to give no more than 9 percent of West Bank
territory to the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu, however, said his
government was willing to hand over more desirable land. "The only thing we
are considering is the quality of the land vs. the quantity," he told
reporters.<br><br>
27.03.1998 , Israel took a tough line on a troop pullback from the West
Bank on Thursday as U.S. presidential envoy Dennis Ross headed in on a
critical bid to shore up crumbling Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. "I
can't accept a dictate," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel
Radio in an interview. "We have our principles. We're not deceiving anyone,
not ourselves, not the voters, not the Palestinians and not the Americans."
Ross was due to arrive later Thursday armed with U.S. proposals that are
reported to call for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13.1% of the West
Bank in return for Palestinian steps to fight Islamic militant attackes.
</p><a name="28mar98"></a><p>
28.03.1998 , U.S. presidential envoy Dennis Ross held four hours of talks
Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a new bid to break
a deadlock on handing more West Bank land to the Palestinians. Neither
Ross, warned by Israel not to dictate a peace deal, nor Netanyahu, under
pressure from hardliners in his government not to relinquish more
territory, made any comment to reporters before or after the meeting at the
prime minister's office. Ross had been widely expected to present U.S.
proposals which reports said called for an Israeli pullback from 13.1% of
the West Bank in return for Palestinian steps to fight Muslim militant
attackes.
</p><a name="29mar98"></a><p>
29.03.1998 , The Egyptian government reportedly has urged Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat not to reject a U.S. peace initiative,
although both the Israeli and Palestinian Cabinets have voted against it.
Under the plan, Israel would cede 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians over 12 weeks. The Palestinians have said they want 30
percent. Israel said it won't release more than 9 percent, because that
figure does not compromise national security.
</p><a name="30mar98"></a><p>
30.03.1998 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held two hours of
talks with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross Sunday night, stating that no West Bank
troop pullbacks will be made without Palestinian security pledges. When
they finished, Ross headed to Gaza for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who declined to answer questions about whether any progress had
been achieved. Ross said talks with both leaders had been "thorough" and
that he would return to Washington to report on the talks.
</p><a name="31mar98"></a><p>
31.03.1998 , A U.S. diplomatic offensive to rescue Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations neared its end on a bleak note Monday, with presidential envoy
Dennis Ross citing diminishing hopes for Middle East peace. "Obviously the
stalemate begins to diminish the hopes...," Ross said at the Egyptian
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh after briefing President Hosni Mubarak. Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also sounded a pessimistic note over the
ability of the latest U.S. shuttle diplomacy to break the year-long peace
freeze. The United States was reportedly seeking an Israeli pullback from
13.1% of the West Bank, a figure Israel says is "unacceptable" and
compromises its security interests.<br><br>
31.03.1998 , Palestinian youths clashed with Israeli troops Monday as
thousands of Arabs staged protests in Israel and the West Bank against land
confiscation, witnesses said. Soldiers fired rubber-coated metal bullets at
protesters in several trouble spots in the West Bank, wounding three
Palestinians. More than 10,000 Israeli-Arabs marched to Arrabeh village in
northern Israel chanting "Long live Palestine." "Land Day represents for us
a day of struggle for all Palestinians, particularly Palestinians in Israel
who struggle against continuous government attempts to confiscate our
land," said one protester.</p><br>

01.04.1998 , Israel made an unexpected offer Tuesday to discuss with the
Palestinians a third pullback on the contested West Bank. The move gave a
slight boost Tuesday to the U.S. government's efforts to reopen
negotiations between the two sides. The offer by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross near the end of Ross' fourth day
of shuttle diplomacy in the area. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine

process.

02.04.1998 , A funeral procession for the chief Hamas bomb maker on
Thursday in the West Bank included thousands of enraged Palestinians
chanting "revenge, revenge" and shaking their fists. Islamic militants say
that Mohiyedine Sharif, who topped Israel's most-wanted list, was
assassinated by Israel. Israel has denied involvement and said Sharif died
when a car bomb exploded prematurely in a Hamas bomb factory. Hamas
dismissed Israel's denial, and on Thursday threatened to carry out attacks
in Israel.
</p><a name="03apr98"></a><p>
03.04.1998 , Thousands of Palestinians buried a master bombmaker from the
Muslim militant group Hamas Thursday with calls for attacks on Israel.
Mourners paraded Muhyideen al-Sharif's body, wrapped in a blanket on a
stretcher, through the streets of El-Bireh while veiled women ululated with
joy at the death a "martyr" of Hamas's armed wing, the Izz el-Deen
al-Qassam Brigades. "Dear, dear Qassam, hit Tel Aviv!" the crowd chanted.
Away from the funeral, Palestinian youths hurled stones at Israeli troops,
who fired tear gas and rubber bullets.
</p><a name="04apr98"></a><p>
04.04.1998 , Shouting for revenge against Israel, thousands of Palestinian
demonstrators in the West Bank and Gaza vented their rage Friday over the
mysterious death of a Muslim militant master bomber. "Dear Qassam, blow up
Tel Aviv," crowds chanted, demanding the military wing of the
fundamentalist Hamas group avenge Muhyideen al-Sharif. Israel rushed to
head off revenge attacks, sending Ami Ayalon, its top secret service
official, to tell Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Gaza that Israelis
had nothing to do with the death of "The Engineer 2," political sources
said.
</p><a name="06apr98"></a><p>
06.04.1998 , A Palestinian inquiry has determined that Hamas master bomb
maker Muhyideen al-Sharif was killed in a power struggle within the
militant Muslim group, Palestinian officials said Monday. The investigation
ordered by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat cleared Israel, which had
denied killing Sharif, of responsibility for the mysterious death. But
Hamas rejected the findings as lies and renewed promises to launch revenge
attacks against Israel. Israeli officials have said such strikes would kill
chances of breaking a year-long peacemaking deadlock with the Palestinian
Authority.<br><br>
06.04.1998 , At least one suspect has been arrested by Palestinian police
in the death of the chief Hamas bomb maker who died under mysterious
circumstances last month, a source close to the investigation said Monday.
The investigation also uncovered large amounts of explosives and a bomb
factory, the source said on condition of anonymity. The findings of the
investigation are to be made public later in the day. Mohiyedine Sharif,
32, was found dead March 29 near the scene of a car bomb explosion in a
garage.

07.04.1998 , Israel, already on high alert after the death of a Hamas
master bomb maker, beefed up security in Jerusalem Tuesday for fear of
possible violence after police shot dead a Palestinian man in a late night
car chase. Israeli police said they shot dead Bilal al-Salaymeh late Monday
after he refused to stop his vehicle and tried to outrun two patrol cars in
a chase along a road from Jerusalem to the Palestinian-ruled town of
Ramallah. The victim's family disputed the police account. Monday night's
shooting added fuel to a volatile situation and police feared Palestinian
violence could erupt.
</p><a name="08apr98"></a><p>
08.04.1998 , Hundreds of Palestinians took part in a march yesterday in
Jerusalem as part of the funeral proceedings for Bilal al-Salaymeh, a
Palestinian who was shot by Israeli police Monday. Al-Salaymeh's family
says he was shot after stopping his car, while Israeli officials say he was
shot while trying to elude police who were pursuing him.<br><br>
08.04.1998 , The military wing of the Muslim militant group Hamas urged
Muslims and Arabs around the world Wednesday to attack Jewish targets to
avenge the death of a bomb maker whose killing it has blamed on Israel. "We
call on all the free and honorable sons of our Palestinian people and...all
those who care about Palestine...to level and aim attacks against Jewish
and Zionist interests which have been spreading all over the world," the
Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades said. The group repeated its dismissal of
the findings of a Palestinian Authority investigation released Monday that
said bomb maker Muhyideen al-Sharif was killed by other members of Hamas.
</p><a name="09apr98"></a><p>
09.04.1998 , The militant Islamic group Hamas yesterday released a video
warning of retaliatory action in Israel for the death of the group's master
bomb maker, Muhyideen al-Sharif. Israel has denied involvement in
al-Sharif's death, and Palestinian officials say he was killed by other
members of Hamas.<br><br>
09.04.1998 , The Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Islamic militant group
Hamas Thursday escalated a war of words over the mysterious killing of
Hamas bombmaker Muhyideen al-Sharif. A senior advisor to Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat threatened to detain Hamas leaders if they
continued to publicly reject the findings of a inquiry by the Authority
which said Sharif was killed in an internal Hamas feud. Sharif, who was
accused by Israel of masterminding a string of martyr bombings, was found
dead on March 29 beside a car that blew up in the Palestinian-ruled West
Bank town of Ramallah. Israel has repeatedly denied any involvement.
</p><a name="10apr98"></a><p>
10.04.1998 , Palestinian officials announced Thursday they arrested Hamas
leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi after the group issued a leaflet demanding the
resignation of officials in Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jibali said Rantisi was being held at a Gaza
police station. "Rantisi has been taken for questioning regarding
statements made against our national interests and the Palestinian
Authority," Jibali said. He did not say when Rantisi would be released.
</p><a name="13apr98"></a><p>
13.04.1998 , Palestinian police released Monday a senior member of the
Islamic Jihad group who was jailed in Gaza Friday after he criticized the
Palestinian Authority's arrest of other Moslem militants, relatives said. A
Palestinian security official said Abdallah al-Shami had been arrested
because he had criticized the arrest of several Moslem militants in a
crackdown following the death of Hamas master bombmaker Muhyideen al-Sharif
in the West Bank on March 29. The Palestinian Authority arrested several
key figures from the militant Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in
connection with Sharif's death.

15.04.1998 , A Palestinian held without trial in Israel for more than five
years was released from prison Wednesday after making a pledge of
non-violence on Israeli television. Ahmed Katamesh, suspected but never
charged by Israel with membership of a "terrorist" organization, was the
longest-serving of its "administrative detainees," who are jailed for
renewable six-month terms by the military. Israeli TV news broadcasts
showed Katamesh taking a pledge of non-violence that it said had secured
his release from Damon prison in northern Israel, where he had been held
since Sept. 1, 1992.
</p><a name="18apr98"></a><p>
18.04.1998 , Palestinian factions Friday called on the Muslim militant
group Hamas to cooperate with the Palestinian Authority's inquiry into the
killing of master bomber Muhyideen al-Sharif. The factions, urging an
easing of tension among Palestinians, also demanded that Hamas stop issuing
leaflets and media statements accusing the Authority of collaborating with
Israel in Sharif's death. Jamal Zakout, coordinator of 12 national and
Islamic factions, said the Palestinian Authority had decided unilaterally
to refrain from issuing media statements on its investigation into the
killing.

Benjamin Netanyahu met Tuesday to discuss the agenda for planned talks in
London next month to revive the stalled Mideast peace process. The two
leaders met over breakfast in Tel Aviv. "The point is to make significant

Hosni Mubarak conferred Wednesday on efforts to save the Middle East peace
process, officials said. U.S. envoy Dennis Ross will visit Israel and
Palestinian areas at the end of this week in a fresh attempt to break a

precisely how much West Bank land Israel will cede to Palestinians in talks
starting this weekend, a U.S. official said Friday. Ross' talks are
intended to pave the way for separate meetings by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat May 4 in London. "We would like to see
an answer in time for the May 4 meeting. Obviously, Ross and (Assistant

said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.<br><br>
24.04.1998 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Thursday
to annex parts of the West Bank if Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
unilaterally declares an independent Palestinian state. "It would be a

we will continue the armed struggle," the Arab Times daily quoted Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin as saying. Yassin is in Kuwait as part of a regional tour. He

a sell-out.

was why up to 800,000 Palestinians left their homes during the fighting.
Although the historians quickly disagreed on reasons for the exodus, they
hailed the importance of their meeting, possibly the first public one of
its kind. Some said it portended reconciliation between peoples, if and
when their leaders reached a peace settlement.<br><br>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to Washington Wednesday to
lobby against the U.S. Middle East peace plan, as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright prepared to try to sell it to him. Albright issued a
"wake-up call" to Israeli and Palestinian leaders to make compromises
before the peace process collapses, but made clear her remarks were aimed
mainly at Israel. She said Tuesday that Washington would revive its idea
for a Middle East summit if she could reach agreement with Netanyahu over
the scale of the next Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank. The U.S.
plan calls for 13% withdrawal, but Israel insists on a 9% pullback.

troop withdrawal. David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Netanyahu, said Israel

troop withdrawal proposals could be "a beginning" towards resuscitating the
deadlocked 5-year-old peace process. But Arafat, attending a commemoration
of the fifth anniversary of the Oslo peace accords, also accused Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of policies in the past two years that
had fostered "despair, hate and violence." Arafat said Israeli proposals on
troop withdrawals from the West Bank in return for Palestinian moves
against anti-Israel guerrillas would be acceptable if they had full access
to all designated area, something Israel opposes.
</p><a name="25aug98"></a><p>

deal on a long-elusive Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank depended
on Palestinian action against "murderers" of Jews. He spoke as one of his
aides said Israel sensed that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was
sounding a "new tone" on peacemaking, but that it remained to be seen if
Arafat would meet key Israeli demands to seal a U.S.-brokered withdrawal
deal. "Progress is linked to the Palestinian fight and actions against the
kind of murderers who acted here," Netanyahu said.

since a martyr bomber killed three Israeli women in a cafe in March 1997.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing the blast and the recent killings
of three Jewish settlers in the West Bank, said he would not sign any deal
to cede more West Bank land to the Palestinian Authority unless it fought
"murderers and terror."</p><br>

19-month-old deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians. While envoy
Dennis Ross pursued a land-and-security deal, Israeli soldiers firing
rubber-coated metal bullets wounded 10 Palestinians during unrest in the

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday in a fresh attempt to bring
peace negotiations with the Palestinians to closure. Officials said U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross had made "modest" progress on a mission to the Middle
East last week. This has raised hopes that protracted negotiations on a
deal giving Palestinians control over 13% more West Bank land could be
wrapped up in the next five or six days when Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat are in New York for the opening of the U.N. General
Assembly.<br><br>

Assembly Monday as he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appear
close to agreement on key points in the long-stalled Middle East peace
process. His speech is considered crucial following requests from U.S.
officials that he not repeat his pledge to declare unilaterally a
Palestinian state on May 4. That is the date when the 1993 Oslo peace
accords that provide the framework for a Middle East agreement expire. Such
a declaration in the United Nations, which would make it official, would
enrage Israel and Netanyahu has warned it could scuttle the peace talks.

changes in the behavior on the ground can be cited," Arafat said in a
speech delivered in English by a top Palestinian negotiator.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and President Bill Clinton in the United States on Oct. 15. She

on its word and the Palestinians of evasion. The U.S., which has already
nursed the talks through six days of roller-coaster negotiations on land
and security, said it would pursue its efforts and submit a new draft
agreement to the Israelis and Palestinians. "We are at a critical

not only a matter of signing a document," he said. Sharon, speaking to
reporters at his farm in southern Israel, condemned an attempted martyr
bomb attack on a bus carrying Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip on

on the militant group Hamas following the attack but said tougher security
steps were needed if Israel was to honor a land-for-security deal signed
last week at the White House.</p><br>

the deaths of nearly 100 Israelis. Palestinian leader Arafat told reporters
during a visit to Spain to explain the Middle East peace agreement that the
Palestinians would continue to work "100%" towards detaining the remaining

that a Palestinian armed uprising could flare up again. "I don't intend to
carry out any redeployment under these conditions, not even the first,
until this is rectified publicly and unequivocally," Netanyahu told

that any problems concerning final-status negotiations will be resolved
through amicable and peaceful ways and through negotiations, but not
through any other means," Arafat told a news conference. Israeli Prime

Palestinians struck his head with rocks. After a minute of relentless
attack, the soldier ran away, bleeding from the head. His assailants stole
his rifle, threw more stones at him, then set his car on fire. In
Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner, Osama Musa Natche, was

03.12.98 , Israel has asked that President Clinton not land at the newly
opened Palestinian airport, saying this would boost Palestinian claims to
independence, a senior Israeli official said Thursday. The Clinton
administration is considering the request, said a U.S. official who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Clinton is to arrive in Israel on Dec. 12 and is
to fly to the Gaza Strip on Dec. 14 to usher in the second stage of the Wye
River land-for-peace agreement he helped negotiate. A possible Clinton
landing at Gaza International, which opened last week as part of the
agreement, had been considered by the White House.

pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye
River land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The renewed
violence and Israel's political turmoil came just a days before President
Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas next week. The trip was
intended to shore up the Wye agreement and restore calm to the region, but
appeared to be having the opposite effect. In the West Bank town of Ram
just north of Jerusalem, several dozen Palestinian high school students
overturned garbage dumpsters Tuesday and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers,
who responded with rubber bullets. Four students were injured
</p><a name="09dec98"></a><p>
09.12.98 , Palestinians held a general stroke yesterday throughout the West
Bank to mark the 11th anniversary of the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation.<br><br>
Despite U.S. appeals to stop violence, Palestinians stoned Wednesday
Israeli troops and motorists in the most widespread West Bank clashes in
months. Israeli army gunfire killed one Palestinian. Troops also fired
rubber-coated steel pellets and tear gas to contain the violent protests on
the 11th anniversary of the start of the Palestinians six-year uprising
against Israel. In all, at least 67 Palestinians were injured by rubber
bullets and three by live rounds. The death came just four days before the
start of President Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, and
was likely to trigger new violence

10.12.98 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday announced an
Israeli crackdown on Palestinian unrest in preparation for U.S. President
Bill Clinton's upcoming trip to the Mid-East.

11.12.98 , On the eve of President Clinton's arrival, Israeli troops opened
fire Friday on hundreds of Palestinian stone throwers, killing two and
injuring 27 during a protest against Israel's refusal to release prisoners.
The violence and Israel's positions concerning the peace agreement Clinton
is coming to promote raised new concerns that the presidential visit will
be plagued by problems. Earlier today, Israel rejected a U.S. compromise on
the release of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body
holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction.
</p><a name="14dec98"></a><p>
14.12.98 , In a historic day stirring Palestinian passions for statehood,
President Clinton stood witness Monday as hundreds of Palestinian leaders
renounced a call for the destruction of Israel. Clinton urged "legitimate
rights for Palestinians, real security for Israel." The Palestinian vote -
registered with a show of hands and applause - removed a contentious issue
dating back to 1964 from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process. The
action appeared to have cleared the way for a three-way meeting among
Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. At stake was the revival of the Wye River
land-for-security accord, nearing collapse with Israelis and the
Palestinians accusing each other of violating the deal .
</p><a name="15dec98"></a><p>
15.12.98 , President Clinton failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume
the West Bank troop withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace
accord, but he held out hope the pullback would take place soon. "We will
have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine," he said.
Speaking to American reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at this
border outpost, Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success. In
remarks to reporters later, Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser, qualified Clinton's remark about the peace process being back on
track. "It's a bumpy track," he said with a smile .

16.12.98 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet
