<div align="center"><font size="+3" color="Blue"> The Cost of Israel to the American People </font></div>
<p>By Richard Curtiss<br><br>
By now many Americans are aware that Israel, with a population of only 5.8
million people, is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid, and that
Israel's aid plus U.S. aid to Egypt's 65 million people for keeping the
peace with Israel has, for many years, consumed more than half of the U.S.
bi-lateral foreign aid budget world-wide.
<br><br>
What few Americans understand however, is the steep price they pay in many
other fields for the U.S.-Israeli relationship, which in turn is a product
of the influence of Israel's powerful U.S. lobby on American domestic
politics and has nothing to do with U.S. strategic interests, U.S. national
interests, or even with traditional American support for
self-determination, human rights, and fair play overseas.
<br><br>
Besides its financial cost, unwavering U.S. support for Israel, whether
it's right or wrong, exacts a huge price in American prestige and
credibility overseas. Further, Israel's powerful U.S. lobby has been a
major factor in delaying campaign finance reform, and also in the removal
from American political life of some of our most distinguished public
servants, members of Congress and even presidents.
<br><br>
Finally, the Israel-U.S. relationship has cost a significant number of
American lives.
<br><br>
The incidents in which hundreds of U.S. service personnel, diplomats, and
civilians have been killed in the Middle East have been reported in the
media. But the media seldom revisits these events, and scrupulously avoids
analyzing why they occurred or compiling the cumulative toll of American
deaths resulting from our Israel-centered Middle East policies. Each of
these four categories of the costs of Israel to the American people merits
a talk of its own. What follows, therefore, is just an overview of such
losses.
<br><br>
First is the financial cost of Israel to U.S. taxpayers. Between 1949 and
1998, the U.S. gave to Israel, with a self-declared population of 5.8
million people, more foreign aid than it gave to all of the countries of
sub-Saharan Africa, all of the countries of Latin America, and all of the
countries of the Caribbean combined - with a total population of
1,054,000,000 people.
<br><br>
In the 1997 fiscal year, for example, Israel received $3 billion from the
foreign aid budget, at least $525 million from other U.S. budgets, and $2
billion in federal loan guarantees. So the 1997 total of U.S. grants and
loan guarantees to Israel was $5.5 billion. That's $15,068,493 per day, 365
days a year.
<br><br>
If you add its foreign aid grants and loans, plus the approximate totals of
grants to Israel from other parts of the U.S. federal budget, Israel has
received since 1949 a grand total of $84.8 billion, excluding the $10
billion in U.S. government loan guarantees it has drawn to date. And if you
calculate what the U.S. has had to pay in interest to borrow this money to
give to Israel, the cost of Israel to U.S. taxpayers rises to $134.8
billion, not adjusted for inflation.
<br><br>
Put another way, the nearly $14,630 every one of 5.8 million Israelis had
received from the U.S. government by October 31, 1997, cost American
taxpayers $23,241 per Israeli. That's $116,205 for every Israeli family of
five.
<br><br>
None of these figures include the private donations by Americans to Israeli
charities, which initially constituted about one quarter of Israel's
budget, and today approach $1 billion annually. In addition to the negative
effect of these donations on the U.S. balance of payments, the donors also
deduct them from their U.S. income taxes, creating another large drain on
the U.S. treasury. Nor do the figures above include any of the indirect
financial costs of Israel to the United States, which cannot be tallied.
One example is the cost to U.S. manufacturers of the Arab boycott, surely
in the billions of dollars by now. Another example is the cost to U.S.
consumers of the price of petroleum, which surged to such heights that it
set off a world-wide recession during the Arab oil boycott imposed in
reaction to U.S. support of Israel in the 1973 war.
<br><br>
Other examples are a portion of the costs of maintaining large U.S. Sixth
Fleet naval forces in the Mediterranean, primarily to protect Israel, and
military air units at the Aviano base in Italy, not to mention the
staggering costs of frequent deployments to the Arabian Peninsula and Gulf
area of land and air forces from the United States and naval units from the
Seventh Fleet, which normally operates in the Pacific Ocean. Many years ago
the late Undersecretary of State George Ball estimated the true financial
cost of Israel to the United States at $11 billion a year.
<br><br>
Since then direct U.S. foreign aid to Israel has nearly doubled, and simply
adjusting that original figure into 1998 dollars would send it considerably
higher today. Next comes the cost of Israel to the international prestige
and credibility of the United States. Americans seem constantly astounded
at our foreign policy failures in the Middle East. This stems from a
profound ignorance of the background of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute,
which in turn results from a reluctance by the mainstream U.S. media to
present these facts objectively.
<br><br>
Toward the end of the 19th century when political Zionism was created in
Europe, Jews were a tiny fraction of the population of the Holy Land, much
of which was heavily cultivated and thickly populated, and certainly not a
desert waiting to be reclaimed by outsiders.
<br><br>
Even in 1947, after half a century of Zionist immigration and an influx of
Jewish refugees from Hitler, Jews still constituted only one third of the
population of the British Mandate of Palestine. Only seven percent of the
land was Jewish-owned. Yet when the United Nations partitioned Palestine in
that year, the Jewish state-to-be received 53 percent and the Arab
state-to-be received only 47 percent of the land. Jerusalem was to remain
separate under international supervision, a "corpus seperatum" in the words
of the United Nations.
<br><br>
One of the myths that many Americans still believe is that the initial war
between the Arabs and Israelis broke out on May 15, 1948 when the British
withdrew and military units from Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and Syria entered
Palestine, allegedly because the Arabs had rejected a partition plan that
the Israelis accepted.
<br><br>
In fact, the fighting began almost six months earlier, immediately after
the partition plan was announced. By the time the Arab armies intervened in
May, some 400,000 Palestinians already had fled or been driven from their
homes.
<br><br>
To the Arab nations the military forces they sent to Palestine were on a
rescue mission to halt the dispossession of Palestinians from the areas the
U.N. had awarded to both the Jewish and the Palestinian Arab state. In fact
history has revealed that the Jordanian forces had orders not to venture
into areas the U.N. had awarded to Israel. Although the newly created
Israeli government didn't formally reject the partition plan, in practice
it never accepted the plan. To this day, half a century later, Israel still
refuses to define its borders. In fact, when the fighting of 1947 and 1948
ended, the State of Israel occupied half of Jerusalem and 78 percent of the
former mandate of Palestine. About 750,000 Muslim and Christian
Palestinians had been driven from towns, villages and homes to which the
Israeli forces never allowed them to return.
<br><br>
The four wars that followed, three of them started by Israel in 1956, 1967,
and 1982, and one of them started by Egypt and Syria to recover their
occupied lands in 1973, have been over the portions of Lebanon, Syria,
Jordan and Egypt which the Israelis occupied militarily in those wars, the
other half of Jerusalem, and the 22 percent of Palestine - comprising the
West Bank and Gaza - which is all that remains for the Palestinians. It is
the unwillingness of successive U.S. governments to acknowledge these
historical facts, and adjust U.S. Middle East policies to right these
wrongs, that has resulted in such a devastating loss of international
credibility. Americans, who once were identified with the modern schools,
universities and hospitals they had established throughout the Middle East
starting more than 150 years ago, now are identified with U.S. misuse of
its veto in the United Nations to condone Israeli violations of the human
rights of the Palestinians living in the lands Israel has seized by force.
The Israeli occupation violates the preface to the United Nations Charter
banning the acquisition of territory by war. What the Israeli government
has been doing in the occupied territories also violates the Fourth Geneva
convention, which forbids the transfer of populations to or from such
areas.
<br><br>
Governments of Middle Eastern countries which once looked to the United
States as their protectors from European colonialism, now find it very
difficult to justify maintaining cordial relations with the United States
at all.
<br><br>
Friendly Arab governments are jeopardized by their U.S. alliances, and the
fall of one, the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq, was directly attributable to
its premature withdrawal of its armed forces from Palestine during the 1948
fighting, and its subsequent membership in a military alliance with the
U.S. and Britain.
<br><br>
Even our European and Asian allies have joined in deploring the perpetual
American tilt toward Israel. In a recent vote on a U.N. General Assembly
resolution calling upon Israel to curb further encroachments on Palestinian
lands by Jewish settlers, only the United States and Micronesia voted with
Israel. Of the 185 U.N. member nations, all of the others, without
exception, voted against Israel or abstained.
<br><br>
Yet Americans seem oblivious to such examples of how their Israel-centered
Middle East policies are isolating the United States in the world. Next is
the cost of Israel to the American domestic political system. In December
1997, Fortune magazine asked professional lobbyists to select the most
powerful special interest group in the United States. They chose the
American Association of Retired Persons, which lobbies on behalf of all
Americans over 60.
<br><br>
In second place, however, was the American Israel Public Affairs Committee,
Israel's official Washington, D.C. lobby, with a $15 million budget - the
sources of which AIPAC refuses to disclose - and 150 employees. AIPAC, in
turn, can draw upon the resources of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, a roof group set up to coordinate the
efforts on behalf of Israel of some 52 national Jewish organizations. Among
those organizations are groups such as B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation
League (ADL), with a $45 million budget, and Hadassah, the Zionist women's
group, which spends more than AIPAC and sends thousands of Americans every
year to Israel on Israeli government-supervised visits. Both AIPAC and the
ADL maintain secret "opposition research" departments which compile files
on politicians, journalists, academics and organizations, and circulate
this information through local Jewish community councils to pro-Israel
groups and activists in order to damage the reputations of those who dare
to speak out and thus have been blackballed as "enemies of Israel." In the
case of ADL, police raids on the organization's Los Angeles and San
Francisco offices established that much of the information they had
compiled was erroneous, and thus slanderous, and some also was illegally
obtained.
<br><br>
In the case of AIPAC, this is not the organization's most controversial
activity. In the 1970s members of AIPAC's national board of directors set
out to form deceptively named local political action committees (PACs)
which could coordinate their efforts in supporting candidates in federal
elections. To date, at least 126 pro-Israel PACs have been registered, and
no fewer than 50 PACs, like AIPAC, can give a candidate who is facing a
tough opponent and who has voted according to AIPAC recommendations up to
half a million dollars. That's enough money to buy all the television time
needed to get elected in most parts of the country.
<br><br>
What is totally unique about AIPAC's network of political action committees
is that they all have deceptive names. Who could possibly know that the
Delaware Valley PAC in Philadelphia, San Franciscans for Good Government in
California, Cactus PAC in Arizona, Chili PAC in New Mexico, Beaver PAC in
Wisconsin and even Ice PAC in New York are really pro-Israel PACs. So just
as no other special interest can put so much hard money into any
candidate's election campaign as can the Israel lobby, no other special
interest has gone to such elaborate lengths to hide its tracks. Some of
America's wisest and most distinguished public servants have been kept from
higher office by the blackballing of the Israel lobby. One such leader was
George Ball, who served the Kennedy administration as Under Secretary of
State and the Johnson administration as U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations. Given his unmatched brilliance in forecasting international
developments, there is no doubt that he would have become secretary of
state had he not publicly expressed the skepticism about the U.S.
relationship with Israel which most Americans involved in foreign affairs
privately feel.
<br><br>
In membership meetings which journalists are not allowed to attend, AIPAC
presidents have boasted that the organization was responsible for the
defeats of two of history's most distinguished chairmen of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee - Democrat J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and
Republican Charles Percy of Illinois. The list of other Senators and House
members for whose election defeats AIPAC takes credit is too long to
recount. There is good evidence also that had it not been for complex
maneuvers by the Israel lobby, including encouragement of third party
candidates and unrelenting partisanship by pro-Israeli syndicated
columnists and other media figures, Democratic President Jimmy Carter
probably would have been reelected in 1980, and Republican President George
Bush almost certainly would have been reelected in 1992.
<br><br>
The cost to our political system of losing national figures who refused to
allow U.S. domestic political interests to dictate U.S. foreign policy has
been enormous. So long as AIPAC and other powerful lobbies continue to
thwart meaningful efforts on behalf of campaign finance reform, Americans
will continue unknowingly paying such costs. Finally, there is the cost of
Israel in American lives. References to the attack by Israeli aircraft and
torpedo boats on the USS Liberty in which 34 Americans were killed and 171
wounded on the fourth day of the Six-Day War of June 1967 often are met by
disbelief. Very few Americans seem to have heard of the attack on the ship
operated by the U.S. Navy for the National Security Agency to monitor
Israel and Arab military communications during the fighting.
<br><br>
The Israeli government claimed it was a case of mistaken identity. The
members of the crew and other naval officers who were stationed in the
Mediterranean and in Washington at the time state that it was a deliberate
attempt to sink the ship and blame Egyptian forces for the disaster. It is
the only such event in U.S. Naval history the cause of which has never been
formally investigated either by Congress or by the Navy itself. Major
losses of American lives at the hands of Arab forces opposing Israel are
better known. These include the loss of 141 U.S. service personnel in the
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in 1984. They also include
the loss of several U.S. diplomats and local employees of the U.S.
government in two bombings of the American Embassy in Beirut. Other such
events include the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, the taking of
U.S. hostages in Beirut of whom three were killed, the deaths of Americans
in a series of Middle East related skyjackings, the deaths of 19 U.S.
service personnel in the bombing of the Al Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia,
and the 1997 assassination of four U.S. accountants working for an American
company in Karachi. All of these incidents, and many more in which
Americans have died, resulted directly from one-sided U.S. support for
Israel in its refusal to participate in the land-for-peace settlement with
the Palestinians and its other Arab neighbors envisioned in U.N.
<br><br>
Security Council Resolution 242. The U.S. has given lip service to that
resolution since November 1967. But in practice the U.S. has done nothing
to force Israel to comply, even though the resolution has been accepted by
the members of the League of Arab States. That U.S. hypocrisy fuels rage
and frustration throughout the Middle East and South Asia which will
continue to take a toll of American lives until Israel finally gives back
the lands it occupied in 1967, or the U.S. stops subsidizing Israeli
intransigence. Claims that there are positive aspects of the U.S.-Israeli
relationship seldom stand up to scrutiny. During the Reagan administration
it was labeled for the first time a "strategic relationship" conferring
benefits on the U.S. as well as on Israel. The idea that Israel - smaller
in both area and population than Hong Kong - can offer the United States
benefits sufficient to offset the hostility that relationship arouses among
250 million Arabs living in a 4,000-mile strategic swath of territory
stretching from Morocco to Oman is ludicrous. It becomes even more
ludicrous when one realizes that the relationship also has alienated
another 750 million Muslims who, together with the Arabs, control more than
60 percent of the world's proven oil and gas reserves. Apologists for
Israel also describe the U.S.-Israeli cooperation in weapons development.
The fact is that the one or two successful joint weapons programs have been
largely U.S. financed, while for their part the Israelis have repeatedly
sold to rogue nations U.S. weapons turned over at no cost to Israel.
<br><br>
It is a sad but proven fact that the Israeli government also has obtained
secret U.S. military technology which Israel has sold to other countries.
For example, after the U.S. sent Patriot missile defense batteries on an
emergency basis to help defend Israel during the Gulf War, the Israelis
seem to have sold the Patriot missile technology to China, according to the
U.S. State Department's inspector general. As a result, the U.S. has been
forced to develop a whole new generation of missile technology able to
penetrate the defenses China has developed as a result of the Israeli
treachery. Perhaps the most hypocritical rationalization offered by friends
of Israel is that U.S. special treatment is justified because Israel is
"the Middle East's only working democracy" and that Israel and the U.S.
have many basic institutions in common. In fact, Israeli democracy does not
work for non-Jews. In contrast to the United States, where by law all
citizens have equal rights regardless of religion or ethnic origin, Muslim
and Christian citizens of Israel do not have equal rights with regards to
military service, the extensive social benefits available to veterans of
Israeli military service, or even in terms of Israeli tax rates imposed on
Arab citizens and Israeli government expenditures in Arab communities
within Israel.
<br><br>
Further, Israeli citizenship is not available to the Muslim and Christian
Palestinians driven from their homes in Israel in 1948, nor to their
descendants. But a Jew, born anywhere in the world, can have Israeli
citizenship for the asking. Perhaps most shocking is the little-known fact
that by now 90 percent of the land in Israel proper is held under
restrictive covenants barring non-Jews, even those with Israeli
citizenship, from owning the land or from earning a living on it.
Unfortunately, the land held under such covenants is increasing, not
decreasing. It would be difficult, therefore, to find two countries more
profoundly different in their approaches to basic questions of citizenship
and civil and human rights as are the United States and Israel.
