<p>After the Suez-Sinai war
Arab nationalism
increased dramatically,
as did demands for
revenge led by Egypt's
president Nasser. The
formation of a united
Arab military command
that massed troops along
the borders, together
with Egypt's closing of
the Straits of Tiran and
Nasser's insistence in
1967 that the UNEF leave
Egypt, led Israel to
attack Egypt, Jordan, and
Syria simultaneously on
June 5 of that year.<br><br>
The war ended six days later with an Israeli
victory. Israel's French-equipped air force wiped
out the air power of its antagonists and was the
chief instrument in the destruction of the Arab
armies.<br><br>
The Six Days War left Israel in possession of Gaza
and the Sinai Peninsula, which it took from Egypt;
Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which it
took from Jordan; and the Golan Heights, taken
from Syria. Land under Israel's jurisdiction after
the 1967 war was about four times the size of the
area within its 1949 armistice frontiers. The
occupied territories included an Arab population
of about 1.5 million.<br><br>
The occupied territories became a major political
issue in Israel after 1967. The right and leaders
of the country's orthodox religious parties
opposed withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza,
which they considered part of Israel. In the Labor
Alignment, opinion was divided; some Laborites
favored outright annexation of the occupied
territories, others favored withdrawal, and some
advocated retaining only those areas vital to
Israel's military security. Several smaller
parties, including the Communists, also opposed
annexation. The majority of Israelis, however,
supported the annexation of East Jerusalem and its
unification with the Jewish sectors of the city,
and the Labor-led government formally united both
parts of Jerusalem a few days after the 1967 war
ended. In 1980 the Knesset passed another law,
declaring Jerusalem “complete and united,”
Israel's eternal capital.<br><br>
The 1967 war was followed by an upsurge of
Palestinian Arab nationalism. Several guerrilla
organizations within the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) carried out guerrillas attacks
on Israeli targets, with the stated objective of
“redeeming Palestine.” guerrillas attacks on
Israelis targets at home and abroad unified public
opinion against recognition of and negotiation
with PLO, but the group nevertheless succeeded in
gaining widespread international support,
including UN recognition as the “sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinians.”.</p>
