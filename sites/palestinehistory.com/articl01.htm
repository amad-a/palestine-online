<p>By Norman Solomon<br><br>
The formula for American media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is simple: Report on the latest developments in the fragile "peace
process." Depict U.S. officials as honest brokers in the negotiations.
Emphasize the need for restraint and compromise instead of instability and
bloodshed.
<br><br>
In the world according to news media, the U.S. government is situated on
high moral ground -- in contrast to some of the intractable adversaries.
"The conflict that had been so elaborately dressed in the civilizing cloak
of a peace effort has been stripped to its barest essence: Jew against
Arab, Arab against Jew," a New York Times dispatch from Jerusalem declared
as fierce clashes in occupied territory neared the end of their second
week.
<br><br>
Soon afterwards, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright proclaimed: "The
cycle of violence has to be stopped." Such pronouncements from Washington
get a lot of respectful media play in our country.
<br><br>
Rarely do American journalists explore the ample reasons to believe that
the United States is part of the oft-decried cycle of violence. Nor, in the
past couple of weeks, has there been much media analysis of the fact that
the violence was overwhelmingly inflicted on Palestinian people.
<br><br>
Within days, several dozen Palestinians were killed by heavily armed men in
uniform -- often described by CNN and other news outlets as "Israeli
security forces." Under the circumstances, it's a notably benign-sounding
term for an army that shoots down protesters.
<br><br>
As for the rock-throwing Palestinians, I have never seen or heard a single
American news account describing them as "pro-democracy demonstrators." Yet
that would be an appropriate way to refer to people who -- after more than
three decades of living under occupation -- are in the streets to demand
self-determination.
<br><br>
While Israeli soldiers and police, with their vastly superior firepower, do
most of the killing, Israel's public-relations engines keep whirling like
well-oiled tops. Days ago, tilted by the usual spin, American news stories
highlighted the specious ultimatums issued by Prime Minister Ehud Barak as
he demanded that Palestinians end the violence -- while uniformed Israelis
under his authority continued to kill them.
<br><br>
Beneath the Israeli "peace process" rhetoric echoed by American media, an
implicit message isn't hard to discern: If only Palestinians would stop
resisting the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, it would no longer be
necessary for Israeli forces to shoot them.
<br><br>
"Israel Extends Time For Peace," said the lead headline on the Oct. 10
front page of USA Today. "Israel early today extended a deadline for
Palestinians to end rioting," the article began. At this rate, we may
someday see a headline that reads: "Israel Demands Palestinians Stop
Attacking Bullets With Their Bodies."
<br><br>
Of course, amid all the nifty Orwellian touches, the proper behavior of
people whose homeland remains under occupation has never quite been spelled
out. But U.S. media coverage has reflexively mimicked the themes coming out
of the White House and State Department. It all makes sense -- as long as
we set aside basic concepts of human rights -- as long as we refuse to
acknowledge that without justice there can be no real peace.
<br><br>
For American journalists on mainstream career ladders, it's prudent to
avoid making a big deal about Israel's human rights violations, which
persist without letup in tandem with Israel's occupation of land it
captured in the 1967 war. Many pundits are fond of cloaking the occupiers
in mantles of righteousness. And we hear few questions raised about the
fact that the occupiers enjoy the powerful backing of the United States.
<br><br>
The silence is usually deafening, even among journalists who write opinion
columns on a regular basis. The U.S. government's economic and military
assistance to Israel adds up to a few billion dollars per year. Among media
professionals, that aid is widely seen as an untouchable "third rail." To
challenge U.S. support for Israel is to invite a torrent of denunciations
-- first and foremost, the accusation of "anti-Semitism."
<br><br>
Occasionally, I've written columns criticizing U.S. media for strong
pro-Israel bias in news reporting and spectrums of commentary. Every time,
I can count on a flurry of angry letters that accuse me of being
anti-Semitic. It's a timeworn, knee-jerk tactic: Whenever someone makes a
coherent critique of Israel's policies, immediately go on the attack with
charges of anti-Jewish bigotry.
<br><br>
Numerous American supporters of Israel resort to this tactic. Perhaps the
difficulties of defending the Israeli occupation on its merits have
encouraged substitution of the "anti-Semitic" epithet for reasoned debate.
<br><br>
Like quite a few other Jewish Americans, I'm appalled by what Israel is
doing with U.S. tax dollars. Meanwhile, as journalists go along to get
along, they diminish the humanity of us all.
<br><br>

"At the threshhold of the third millennium, liberation strategies have to
ensure that human freedom is not gained at the cost of other species, that
freedom for one race or gender is not based on increased subjugation of
other races and genders. In each of these strivings for freedom, the
challenge is to include the Other."
