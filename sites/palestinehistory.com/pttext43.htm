<p>On October 6th, President Mohammed Anwar el Sadat
of Egypt was murdered by Islamic fundamentalist
gunmen in Cairo. The shooting happened at 1 p.m.
during the annual military parade to commemorate
the beginning of the Egyptian attacked in the
1973 Arab-Israeli war. A lorry in the procession
stopped in front of the rostrum where the
President and other luminaries were watching a
fly-past of Egyptian Air Force jets. Armed men
climbed out and ran towards Sadat, hurling
grenades and opening fire with automatic weapons.
The President and seven others fell, mortally
wounded . Sadat was flown to the Maadi military
hospital where he died an hour and 40 minutes
later. Sadat's funeral on October 10th was
attended by only one Arab head of state. He had
isolated himself in the Arab world by the
rapprochement with Israel which had won him and
Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 and
led to a peace treaty between the two countries in
1979. Iraq, Libya, Syria and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization openly applauded his
assassination.</p>
