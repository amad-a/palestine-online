<p>Jerusalem has been a walled city forever, with various conquerors tearing
down the walls and rebuilding them, always out of stone. To this very day,
in fact, all new buildings in Jerusalem must be built from Jerusalem stone.<br><br>
The walls of Jerusalem have eight gates: Zion Gate, Jaffa Gate, New Gate,
Damascus Gate, Herod's Gate, Lions Gate, Golden Gate, and Dung Gate, where
in ancient times they used to take out the garbage. The Golden Gate, in the
eastern wall of the city, was sealed up in the Crusader Period.</p><br>

<p>The Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into four residential quarters:
Muslim, Armenian, Jewish, and Christian. This division originated with the
desire of four religious groups to live close to their holiest sites : the
Church of St. James for Armenians, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque
for Muslims and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which contains the tomb
of Jesus, for the Christians.</p>

<p>The Muslim Quarter, the largest and most densely populated of the Old
City's four quarters, is home to 20,000 Muslim residents of Jerusalem.<br><br>
If you can make your way through the narrow alleys and noisy markets, there
are many exquisite examples of medieval Islamic architecture tucked away
here.</p><br>

<p>Five times a day you can hear the voice of the Muezzin calling the faithful
to prayer. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is The oldest extant Islamic monument and one
of the largest in the world and is located adjacent to the Muslim quarter
on the al-Haram al-Sharif.</p><br>

<p>The Dome of the Rock is one of the oldest shrine of the Islamic world,
built by the Caliph Abd al-Malik at the end of the 7th century C.E.<br><br>
The Dome of the Rock covers el-Sakhra, the big rock from which the prophet
Muhammad ascended to heaven to meet with God. This golden dome is the most
stunning sight in all of Jerusalem .</p><br>

<p>No trip to Jerusalem is complete without a visit to the Arab market, or
souk.<br><br>
The souk runs through both the Christian and Muslim Quarters in a maze of
crowded streets, some of them hidden from the sun by buildings that date
back to Crusader days.<br><br>
For people who live here, the souk is no more exotic than a shopping mall,
a place to buy vegetables, clothes, plumbing supplies, spices, or fresh
meat .</p><br>

<p>The Armenians were the first nation to embrace Christianity, in the year
301 C.E.<br><br>
The Armenian community in Jerusalem flourished during Crusader times, which
is when they built the magnificent Church of St. James.<br><br>
Today the Armenian Quarter is surrounded by high walls, which give it an
air of mystery. There is a monastery inside but also a thriving residential
community of more then 2,000 people, with schools, a library, and a museum.
The Armenians were pioneers in the field of photography in this country and
are also world famous for their gorgeous ceramics.</p><br>

<p>The many churches of the Christian Quarter reflect the complexity of
Jerusalem's Christian community, numbering 4,700 people.<br><br>
Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholics, Copts, Lutherans,
Ethiopians, and various other Christian denominations all make their home
here. Each has its own history, but all share a common desire to maintain a
presence in Jerusalem, the city where Jesus walked.</p><br>

<p>The Christian Quarter is dominated by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.<br><br>
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is where, according to ancient Christian
tradition, Jesus was crucified and buried. For centuries, millions of
Christian pilgrims have come here from all over the world. The church was
originally built in the 4th century by the Emperor Constantine, who made
Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire.<br><br>
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a charming architectural jumble. Most
of what now exists dates from the Crusader period. Today, the Church is
shared by six Christian denominations. To keep things impartial, the keys
to the building have been entrusted to a prominent Muslim family since the
year 1187.</p><br>

<p>This is the western wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque , Jewish and Israel assumed that
this is all that is left of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by the
Romans nearly 2,000 years ago.<br><br>
All the archaeological researches shows that this wall are from the Islamic
ages and have nothing to do with the assumed Jewish Temple .<br><br>
There is a number of archaeological researches published in Jews Media and
University shows this facts . </p><br>
