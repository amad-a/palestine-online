stop using the language of ultimatums. The negotiations are progressing
with the good will of Israel, and, I want to believe, also of the
Palestinians," Netanyahu said. The Palestinian Authority has called present
talks a "waste of time" and warned Sunday it would sever contacts if
Israeli negotiators failed to bring new ideas to the latest round of talks
on Monday evening.<br><br>
04.08.98 , Palestinian official Hassan Asfour said yesterday that peace
talks with Israel could be halted due to what he characterized as Israel's
refusal to present acceptable proposals for ending a 16-month deadlock in
the peace process.<br><br>
05.08.98 , Gunmen shot dead two Jewish settlers in the West Bank overnight
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded Wednesday with
defiant backing for more construction on occupied land. Tuesday night's
ambush at Yitzhar settlement near Nablus put fresh strain on faltering
peace moves between Israel and the Palestinians, with hardline Israeli
politicians calling for a halt to the negotiations. The two men, aged 18
and 24, were on a security patrol at the settlement when the gunmen opened
fire on their car.<br><br>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat announced a long-awaited cabinet
reshuffle on Wednesday but stunned legislators by keeping ministers they
had wanted sacked for alleged corruption and mismanagement. "The old
ministries will remain the same," Arafat said before naming 10 additional
ministers to an expanded cabinet amid catcalls from members of the 88-seat
Legislative Council. Arafat accepted the resignation of his 18-seat cabinet
in June, when lawmakers agreed to hold off a no-confidence vote to give him
more time to appoint a new team.<br><br>
12.08.98 , Instability has returned to the Middle East because of Israel's
refusal to implement peace accords and this has opened the way for the
return of war there, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday. "It
(Israel) has challenged international legitimacy and its resolutions and
opened the door wide for the return of violence, anarchy, war and
destruction," Arafat told a joint sitting of South Africa's two houses of
parliament. Arafat said Palestinians had fulfilled their obligations, but
that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government had turned its back on
peace deals struck in Oslo and Madrid.<br><br>
17.08.98 , Authorities in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank town of
Jericho are reported to be conducting a house-to-house search for Imad
Awadallah, a former leader of the Islamic group Hamas, who escaped from

21.08.98 , Israeli troops sealed off the West Bank city of Hebron Friday
while searching for a suspected Palestinian assailant who stabbed a Jewish
settler to death and torched his home. The army said it was barring
Palestinians from entering and leaving the volatile city following the
late-night killing of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63-year-old grandson of a
spiritual leader of Israel's settler movement. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu cut short a holiday in northern Israel, announcing he would
return to Jerusalem in the afternoon for consultations in the face of
tensions in Hebron and in Lebanon where Hizbollah guerrillas killed two
Israelis.<br><br>
24.08.98 , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said Monday that Israeli
troop withdrawal proposals could be "a beginning" towards resuscitating the
deadlocked 5-year-old peace process. But Arafat, attending a commemoration
of the fifth anniversary of the Oslo peace accords, also accused Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of policies in the past two years that
had fostered "despair, hate and violence." Arafat said Israeli proposals on
troop withdrawals from the West Bank in return for Palestinian moves
against anti-Israel guerrillas would be acceptable if they had full access
to all designated area, something Israel opposes.<br><br>
25.08.98 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that a
deal on a long-elusive Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank depended
on Palestinian action against "murderers" of Jews. He spoke as one of his
aides said Israel sensed that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was
sounding a "new tone" on peacemaking, but that it remained to be seen if
Arafat would meet key Israeli demands to seal a U.S.-brokered withdrawal
deal. "Progress is linked to the Palestinian fight and actions against the
kind of murderers who acted here," Netanyahu said.<br><br>
27.08.98 , A bomb exploded in the heart of Tel Aviv Thursday, injuring 21
people on a busy street near the city's main synagogue in an attack police
said was the work of suspected Palestinian militants. There was no
immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, the first in Tel Aviv
since a martyr bomber killed three Israeli women in a cafe in March 1997.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing the blast and the recent killings
of three Jewish settlers in the West Bank, said he would not sign any deal
to cede more West Bank land to the Palestinian Authority unless it fought
"murderers and terror." </p><br>

<p>08.09.98 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope
yesterday that a visit to the Middle East by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross would
help achieve an agreement between Israel and Palestinians on the partial
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank.<br><br>
10.09.98 , Reports from Israel say U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is expected to
stay in Israel this weekend in an attempt to broker a deal for handing over
more of the West Bank to Palestinians. Ross met with Palestinian leaders
yesterday and with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today.</p><br>
<p>11.09.98 , The Islamic movement Hamas vowed Friday to send martyr bombers
into Israel to avenge the killing of two leading Hamas militants. Israel
sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza Strip and put its troops on
alert to guard against attacks by the group whose bombers have killed
scores of Israelis. Israeli troops killed the two Palestinian brothers Imad
and Adel Awadallah during a West Bank clash Thursday. Israel long had
sought both of them as leaders of the Hamas military wing.<br><br>
18.09.98 , U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy extended his Middle
East peace mission Friday, saying he was making headway towards ending a
19-month-old deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians. While envoy
Dennis Ross pursued a land-and-security deal, Israeli soldiers firing
rubber-coated metal bullets wounded 10 Palestinians during unrest in the
West Bank, witnesses said. "We had a very good discussion and I think we
are making headway," Ross said after meeting Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat in Gaza. It was Ross's most optimistic assessment since he arrived
in the region.<br><br>
19.09.98 , Reports say a Palestinian teenager was killed yesterday in a
shooting incident involving Jewish settlers in the West Bank.<br><br>
23.09.98 , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned to meet Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday in a fresh attempt to bring
peace negotiations with the Palestinians to closure. Officials said U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross had made "modest" progress on a mission to the Middle
East last week. This has raised hopes that protracted negotiations on a
deal giving Palestinians control over 13% more West Bank land could be
wrapped up in the next five or six days when Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat are in New York for the opening of the U.N. General
Assembly.<br><br>
President Yasser Arafat has rejected the resignation of top Palestinian
peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official said Wednesday.
Erekat, who has steered Palestinian negotiations on a further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, asked to be relieved of his post as chief
negotiator over differences with other officials on the handling of talks.
Hassan Asfour, another negotiator and a minister of state in Arafat's
cabinet, said he had attended a meeting between Arafat and Erekat in Gaza
Tuesday at which the Palestinian leader turned down Erekat's resignation.<br><br>

28.09.98 , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat addresses the U.N. General
Assembly Monday as he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appear
close to agreement on key points in the long-stalled Middle East peace
process. His speech is considered crucial following requests from U.S.
officials that he not repeat his pledge to declare unilaterally a
Palestinian state on May 4. That is the date when the 1993 Oslo peace
accords that provide the framework for a Middle East agreement expire. Such
a declaration in the United Nations, which would make it official, would
enrage Israel and Netanyahu has warned it could scuttle the peace talks.</p><br>
<p>29.09.98 , President Clinton met with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
Tuesday in a bid to narrow differences to reach accord on a controversial
new round of Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank. Clinton met
jointly with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
and invited them to return in about two weeks for a summit designed to nail
down the timetable for the troop pullout. White House Press Secretary Mike
McCurry said Clinton was prepared to become directly involved in the
mid-October summit with Arafat and Netanyahu.<br><br>
Security forces clashed with Arab protesters in northern Israel Tuesday
during a general strike against land confiscation and alleged police
brutality. Witnesses said paramilitary police fired rubber-coated bullets
and tear gas at hundreds of stone throwers in Umm al-Fahm and Nazareth, the
two biggest Arab towns in Israel. In Umm al-Fahm, the scene of unrest since
Sunday, President Ezer Weizman met local officials to try to calm tension
before the start on Tuesday evening of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the
Jewish calendar.<br><br>
30.09.98 , Eleven Palestinians and nine Israeli soldiers were wounded
Wednesday in explosions and shooting in the divided West Bank city of
Hebron, witnesses and security officials said. The Israeli army announced
it had imposed a curfew on the center of the city and said the incident
began with a grenade attack on one of its patrols by a Palestinian
assailant. Palestinian residents of Hebron, a frequent flashpoint, blamed
Jewish settlers for the violence, which flared in the heart of the city
close to one of their enclaves. Details were unclear. </p><br>

<p>01.10.98 , Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets to disperse around
200 Palestinian demonstrators who lobbed rocks and petrol bombs in the
volatile West Bank town of Hebron Thursday, witnesses said. They said at
least six protesters were wounded before the troops and Palestinian police
pushed demonstrators back into Palestinian-controlled areas of the city. It
was the second day of violence in Hebron since a Palestinian threw two hand
grenades at a patrol in the Israeli-controlled part of the city close to a
Jewish settler enclave on Wednesday. At least 11 Palestinians and 13
Israeli soldiers and border police were wounded in the grenade attack and
subsequent shooting.<br><br>
02.10.98 , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said Friday no "substantive"
progress had been made in his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington this week on breaking the impasse in Middle East peacemaking.
"No substantive progress can really be cited, no substantive steps or even
changes in the behavior on the ground can be cited," Arafat said in a
speech delivered in English by a top Palestinian negotiator.<br><br>
05.10.98 , U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left Washington for
the Middle East Monday in the hope of breaking 19 months of deadlock in
talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The trip, her first to the
region in more than a year, should pave the way for a summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and President Bill Clinton in the United States on Oct. 15. She
plans to spend about two days in the region but two aides, Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk and special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross,

Israelis threatened to walk out, accusing the United States of going back
on its word and the Palestinians of evasion. The U.S., which has already
nursed the talks through six days of roller-coaster negotiations on land
and security, said it would pursue its efforts and submit a new draft
agreement to the Israelis and Palestinians. "We are at a critical
moment.... We can't answer the question of which way this will go. The
United States can only do so much," said State Department spokesman James
Rubin.<br><br>
22.10.98 , Reports say a final draft of an interim peace agreement is

Palestinians would "take years" to achieve, and called violence by Islamic
militants a strategic threat to the Middle East. "Speaking about peace is
not only a matter of signing a document," he said. Sharon, speaking to
reporters at his farm in southern Israel, condemned an attempted martyr
bomb attack on a bus carrying Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip on
Thursday. He cautiously welcomed a crackdown by the Palestinian Authority
on the militant group Hamas following the attack but said tougher security
steps were needed if Israel was to honor a land-for-security deal signed
last week at the White House. </p><br>

the deaths of nearly 100 Israelis. Palestinian leader Arafat told reporters
during a visit to Spain to explain the Middle East peace agreement that the
Palestinians would continue to work "100%" towards detaining the remaining

carry out any redeployment under these conditions, not even the first,
until this is rectified publicly and unequivocally," Netanyahu told

to retract warnings over possible renewed armed struggle. "I...reiterate
that any problems concerning final-status negotiations will be resolved
through amicable and peaceful ways and through negotiations, but not

Israel ordered the first withdrawal of troops from the occupied West Bank
in nearly two years Thursday, honoring its new peace deal with the
Palestinians. The cabinet gave its go-ahead after ministers agreed that the
Palestinians had met their initial security obligations under the
three stages accord signed at the White House on Oct. 23. "The government
today decided to approve the first stage of the further redeployment in the

smashing its windshield then dragging him out and beating him with stones
in a brutal assault that was captured by news cameras. The soldier cowered
by the car door, holding his hands up to fend off blows as several
Palestinians struck his head with rocks. After a minute of relentless
attack, the soldier ran away, bleeding from the head. His assailants stole
his rifle, threw more stones at him, then set his car on fire. In
Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner, Osama Musa Natche, was
stabbed to death Wednesday in what police believe was an attack by an
Israeli extremist blamed for six other stabbings.<br><br>
03.12.98 , Israel has asked that President Clinton not land at the newly
opened Palestinian airport, saying this would boost Palestinian claims to
independence, a senior Israeli official said Thursday. The Clinton
administration is considering the request, said a U.S. official who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Clinton is to arrive in Israel on Dec. 12 and is
to fly to the Gaza Strip on Dec. 14 to usher in the second stage of the Wye
River land-for-peace agreement he helped negotiate. A possible Clinton
landing at Gaza International, which opened last week as part of the
agreement, had been considered by the White House.<br><br>
04.12.98 , Israel has suspended its troop withdrawal from the West Bank
following an attack by Palestinians on two Israelis.<br><br>
08.12.98 , New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as domestic
pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye
River land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The renewed
violence and Israel's political turmoil came just a days before President
Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas next week. The trip was
intended to shore up the Wye agreement and restore calm to the region, but
appeared to be having the opposite effect. In the West Bank town of Ram
just north of Jerusalem, several dozen Palestinian high school students
overturned garbage dumpsters Tuesday and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers,
who responded with rubber bullets. Four students were injured<br><br>
09.12.98 , Palestinians held a general stroke yesterday throughout the West
Bank to mark the 11th anniversary of the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation.<br><br>
Despite U.S. appeals to stop violence, Palestinians stoned Wednesday
Israeli troops and motorists in the most widespread West Bank clashes in
months. Israeli army gunfire killed one Palestinian. Troops also fired
rubber-coated steel pellets and tear gas to contain the violent protests on
the 11th anniversary of the start of the Palestinians six-year uprising
against Israel. In all, at least 67 Palestinians were injured by rubber
bullets and three by live rounds. The death came just four days before the
start of President Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, and
was likely to trigger new violence.<br><br>
10.12.98 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday announced an
Israeli crackdown on Palestinian unrest in preparation for U.S. President
Bill Clinton's upcoming trip to the Mid-East.<br><br>
11.12.98 , On the eve of President Clinton's arrival, Israeli troops opened
fire Friday on hundreds of Palestinian stone throwers, killing two and
injuring 27 during a protest against Israel's refusal to release prisoners.
The violence and Israel's positions concerning the peace agreement Clinton
is coming to promote raised new concerns that the presidential visit will
be plagued by problems. Earlier today, Israel rejected a U.S. compromise on
the release of Palestinian prisoners and also affirmed it will not withdraw
troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body
holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction. </p><br>
<p>14.12.98 , In a historic day stirring Palestinian passions for statehood,
President Clinton stood witness Monday as hundreds of Palestinian leaders
renounced a call for the destruction of Israel. Clinton urged "legitimate
rights for Palestinians, real security for Israel." The Palestinian vote -
registered with a show of hands and applause - removed a contentious issue
dating back to 1964 from the crisis-shrouded Mideast peace process. The
action appeared to have cleared the way for a three ways meeting among
Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. At stake was the revival of the Wye River
land-for-security accord, nearing collapse with Israelis and the
Palestinians accusing each other of violating the deal .<br><br>
15.12.98 , President Clinton failed Tuesday to persuade Israel to resume
the West Bank troop withdrawals called for under the Wye River peace
accord, but he held out hope the pull back would take place soon. "We will
have fits and starts but we will get through this just fine," he said.
Speaking to American reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at this
border outpost, Clinton called his three-day Mideast trip a success. In
remarks to reporters later, Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser, qualified Clinton's remark about the peace process being back on
track. "It's a bumpy track," he said with a smile .<br><br>
16.12.98 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet
yesterday that Israel would not proceed with a scheduled hand over of more
of the West Bank to Palestinians on Friday. Netanyahu said that
