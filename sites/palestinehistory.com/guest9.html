comment is most distressing, are you talking about some ball game in the States 
here when you say <br>&gt;I don't know what else to say, 
other than the Israelis are not going to take much more than this, and they 
(unfortunately) will absolutely slaughter you guys.&lt;<br><br>Slaughter? Well I am not so sure, 
Israel is only big because he has big brother America on it¥s side. Don¥t forget 
there are a lot of Arab nations who are behind Palestinians. The slaughtering 
will come when Israel assasinate Arafat (I really pray this does not happen but 
I am sure and sad to say it looks increasingly likely). That is slaughter. In 
case you do not know but America is also increasingly losing a lot of friends 
because a lot of truths are coming out, for a new country you sure as hell think 
you own the planet and poking your nose into two nations that have thousands of 
years History.<br>I am always for peace, I am sure you read 
a lot of stuff but you seem to have an American attitude when you say "slaughter 
you guys". I am on the side of the truth, I am not any of their religion at all, 
I know little about Jew and Arab but I sure as hell know about Human rights and 
human rights atrocioties are being committed against Palestinians by Americans 
and Isrealis.All I see on CNN is "today another suicide bomber kills innocent 
victims in a supermarket downtown". Excuse me but do you know why? Do you think 
suicide bombers do it for fun? Do you think a couple of kids just decide to have 
a bit of a laugh downtown? NO, they are very courageous people who do this, 
allbeit it is wrong but it is also wrong when an Israeli soldier fires a rocket 
with the words U.S. with a bar code on the side.<br>I rest 
my case<br>Peace to the Middle East<br>Stephen<br><br><br>

back and read some History about Blacks in your country. I suggest also you read 
more with an open mind about the History relating to Israel and Palestine.The 
unfortunate thing is that your country (if you are American) is as much a danger 
as Hitler was in World War 2. Do you know your History? Have you any idea how 
many Women and Children America and England have killed in their "History".<br>I know as well as you and every one else their will never be 
peace in the Middle East, not in our lifetime...people are too angry, it has 
gone too far and as for your comments about Jews &gt;the Jews are a forgiving 
and tolerant people&lt; I hastened to add but they are not, they are the powers 
that be in your congress and governmental regime...yes I say the word "regime" 
because that is what the U.S is.Tolerance does not come into it, it is about 
power, money, land and a man will do anything to get his hands on one if not 3 
of the said...REGARDLESS OF HIS RELIGION. I am really sick of hearing how 
tolerant Jews are supposed to be, if a Jew is tolerant he chooses to be because 
of his personallity and not because of his religion or beliefs.A Palestinian can 
also be tolerant, i am sure there are many who are tolerant but the worlds press 
does not regard Palestinians as anything but suicide bombers.<br>LEAVE PALESTINIANS IN PEACE, BUSH stay out of the heat if 
you can¥t stand the kitchen and ISRAEL if you are so tolerant then show it!!!<br><br>

defeated/concured people such as yours just has to accept their losses. How 
about instead of expending energy targeting Jewish women and children and your 
fruitless goal self government, you try and build a life WITHIN Israel without 
violence. Blend with their nation, and make mutual defense a priority. Now it 
may take some time on both sides to get over bigotry and hatred, maybe a 
generation, but in the end it will be much more prosperous on both sides. 
Whether you believe it or not, the Jews are a forgiving and tolerant people, and 
I guarantee they will match any trust you show to them. Blacks here in America 
were once slaves and victims of state nation wide racism....and while there is 
still some of that around, we also have a black man as SecState. The reason they 
went from Segregation to Integration so fast was mainly because they weren't 
blowing us white folks up. I don't know what else to say, other than the 
Israelis are not going to take much more than this, and they (unfortunately)

trying to make light of suffering. I would much rather see peace any day. I do 
however have one important question. <br><br>It is easy to flaunt labels. Can anyone please tell me,<br>What is a Palestinian? What is an Israeli? What is an Arab? 
What is a Jew?<br><br>We were all once a 
baby in the womb. A language is learnt from hearing it, nothing in the blood. A 
culture is taught, it is not in the genes. At the time of birth, we were all a 
crying baby who knew no different.<br><br>What exactly gives any group of people to put a border 
around and say "this is reserved for us". I fully understand that no one should 
be oppressed. That goes without saying. Any form of oppression, be it worse or 
not as bad as other parts of the world should end. There is no question about 
that. <br><br>What however gives any 
group the right to reserve land for certain people only? What gave Palestine a 
right to exist in the first place? What gave those people the right to put a 
border around for 2000 years and deny others entry? Can any one tell me what 
gave those people the right?<br><br>Israel is no different. It is people putting a border around 
and reserving it for certain people only.<br><br>Mutually, if a Palestinian state is declared for example on 
Wesbank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, it is racist.<br><br>That means if two babies are born, because they happen to be 
born to certain parents, have to live in a certain area because of who they born 
to. If one baby's parents happen to see themselves as Jewish, the child must 
live in a certain area. If another child's parents' see themselves as 
Palestinian, that child must then live in a certain area. This is because of 
events that took place before the child was born, which the child had no control 
over. We can discuss everything as much as possible. Why whould new born baby's 
be broutht into it?<br><br>To have 
recognized declared countries "Israel" and "Palestine" would mean legalized 
segregation.<br><br>To repeat myself, I 
am not making light of human suffering. To hear about people dying or being hurt 
upsets me terribly. That suffering must stop.<br><br>I am not for a second denying the suffering. It's terrible. 
I am questioning the labels attached to the people. It is easy to flaunt labels. 
Can anyone please tell me in an unambiguous way, what is an Israeli, 
Palestinian, Arab, Jew.<br><br>e.g. a 
room is full of a whole lot of one hour old baby's crying. Would anyone be able 
to identify which "label" to attach to which baby???<br><br>I am not making light of the suffering at all. Suffering is 
terrible. There is no question about ending suffering.<br>What I am questioning is should we use words if we don't 
know (or do know?) exactly what they mean.<br>

show courage and honesty, we as British and American are being led down a garden 
path when it comes to CNN and BBC. I would urge more Americans and British to

or courage but this site should win an award for its honesty alone, it certainly 
showed me the way to the truth...I have always questioned Americas policy with 
their own people so what chance do they have with the policy of other lands, and 
WHAT the hell is America doing siding with Israel? Instead of siding with both.

EVERYBODY is someones Son or Daughter. I think the US and Britain jump on the 
bandwagon and I am lucky enough to have an open mind, I cannot believe 
Politicians don¥t have an open mind also. I am Scottish and England did to us 
what US and Israel are doing to Palestinian people, the English ransacked our 
land raping our Woman and Children, killing our Men and Boys. The NEW Americans 
did the same to Native Indians so tell me who is the TERRORIST now? The 
Palestinian for being a Scot and a Red Indian? or the Israelis/Americans for 
raping, stealing lying and cheating?<br>I recall on the 12th 
September 2001 the words (and I quote quite freely) Mr. Bush.<br>&gt;America was targeted because it is the brightest beacon 
for FREEDOM&lt; end of quote<br><br>I am 
sorry Mr Bush but America was targeted becaue it feeds weapon armoury to Israel 
to kill a Son AND a DAUGHTER in Palestine.<br>The September 
11th day was a disaster cooking. Instead of looking after her own peoples 
security the US was too busy in Isreal looking after them. Too many Jews in 
congress in the United States of America with closed minds.<br>There will never be peace in the middle East in our lifetime 
as long as America is the niteclub bouncer but let me tell you this from a quote 
from myself 2 years ago:<br><HALF 
America<br loves World the of>but please beware.......the other half doesn¥t.<br>I am not anti-anything, I am pro peace but with a closed 
mind there will be other "disasters cooking"...I believe there is one already in

you do not want to know the things that happened to me for speaking out against

very high positioned prominent politician who wants <br>to 
stay anonymous. I want you palestinian friends to get your own independent <br>state. So listen what I got to tell you and forward it to 
your friends and relatives<br>in order to get your 
independent state. Believe me, I know what I am talking from<br>and I still met Yassir and Sharon a few times. So listen:<br><br>A free Palestine will come, and this 
free Palestine needs people like you. So don't <br>give your 
live for the israeli government - save it for the great days you'll have<br>in your country, in the free state of Palestine. Save your 
live to have children, <br>pure palestinians born in the UNO 
member state of Palestine.<br><br>Look 
how the east germans dropped the wall in 1989. They fought unarmed with their 
words<br>and their minds against the strong political 
machine of the German "(non) Democratic" <br>Republic (GDR)- 
and yes, yes they won. David won against Goliath. Allah means peace,<br>and peace ist the strongest force on earth. It's protected 
and ensured by NATO.<br>No government on earth can kill 
innocent unarmed demonstrants, otherwise NATO will <br>blast 
'em to hell. Peaceful protests are poison for the israeli hardliner government, 
<br>but they can't stop or attack these peaceful protests. 
They got rifles, missiles and guns<br>but they don't have a 
weapon against your mind, your spirit or PEACE. So use this <br>strongest force the Koran teached you. <br><br>International camera teams and 
reporters are everywhere as you surely know. They're the<br>life insurance for all peaceful demonstrants. Well I just 
watched news on TV and it happened:<br>Even native israelis 
are demonstrating for a free state of Palestine. The strong beton<br>wall gets weaker and weaker, it's time for a break through, 
isn't it? <br><br>summary:<br>1. the UN declared that it's about to accept a free 
Palestine.<br>2. even israeli civillians are demonstrating 
for a free palestinian state.<br>3. israels government is 
being criticized harder than ever.<br>4. all it takes is a 
little bit of peace.<br><br>You aren't 
stupid. So think about it in your own interest. Please. Do it for your 
children<br>and you independent state of palestine.<br><br>Might God bless You,<br>Anonymous<br><br>DIPLOMAT<br>

recent contribution to this guestbook from Douglas L Perle:<br><br>Palestinians' misery is in many 
ways Israel's shared misery. Israel's controls over occupied Palestinians' land 
don't benefit the Israeli government one bit, politically or economically. The 
continuing, painful plight of Palestinian refugees and resettlers is not only of 
concern to most Israelis - it is top of the political agenda. But Israeli 
governments have been unable to close on any negotiations whatsoever with 
Palestinian representatives, and most recently some Palestinians have again 
become an actual security threat to Israel, which Ariel Sharon responds to 
militarily ( - I do hope that Shimon Peres' negotiations will become officially 
recognised). But many Israelis and Jews disagree passionately amongst themselves 
about the balance between Israel's security, and Palestinian welfare and the 
return of captured land. Many feel that Palestinian welfare must be improved 
urgently, which Yassir Arafat has not done even when he had generous money. 
Anyway that is why I am upset at the following kind of thinking:<br><br>

at 00:34:29 (CST)<br><br><b>Comments:</B><br>June 8 1967 <br><br>The American intelligence ship 
Liberty is off the coast of Israel. This ship is unmistakable as anything other 
than a United States Intelligence gathering ship. It is so ugly it is known the 
world over by all nations, it is recognized by the mass of antenna protruding 
from the decks and mast.<br>The American flag and all 
insignia indicated that this was the American ship USS Liberty. No mistaking the 
American Flag that flew proudly over the ship. All the insignias of the liberty 
were seen by the Israeli airplanes that flew over her eight times in less that 
eight hours prior to the attack on the Liberty. The Israelis knew that the 
Liberty could intercept all communications of any type from all parties involved 
in the six day war. They all so knew that President Johnson would opposed the 
Israeli plans to take the Golan Heights from Syria. Knowing that we would oppose 
the Israeli attack on Syria and taking the Golan Heights Israel deliberately and 
without regard for human life attacked the USS Liberty.<br><br>Moshe Dayan Knew exactly what to 
do to prevent the United States from finding out about Israel's attack on the 
Syrian Golan Heights. Destroy the USS Liberty prevent the US from finding out 
too soon about the attack on Syria. It did not matter to this Jewish General 
what life it cost. Just prevent the United States from finding out too soon 
about the attack on Syria. No matter that he, Moshe Dayan, killed 34 Americans 
and injured 171 more! The really cold blooded Jewish event is that for 25 
minutes it attacked the USS Liberty with napalm, bombs, rockets and machinegun 
fire. Then Israeli torpedo boats came with in 100 feet of the USS Liberty and 
began firing cannons and machineguns at life boats and men still on the ship. 
This was another mass murder attempt of the Israelis to prevent anyone telling 
about how they defy law and respect! For the Israelis have no law or respect for 
anyone who might stand in the Israeli path. <br>It is now 
know that if the rescue aircraft had not been recalled they would have arrived 
before the torpedo boat attack. This would have saved 25 lives. The torpedo boat 
commanders did not know when the sixth fleet would arrive at the USS Liberty. 
This unknown arrival time caused the attack to last only 40 minutes rather than 
the torpedo boats remaining to send the USS Liberty and its crew of 294 to the 
bottom.<br><br>The United States 
Congress and United States Senate have never held public hearings on Israeli 
culpability in this mass murder of American Citizens in uniform! <br><br>WHY? Part two. <br><br>

two things on this web site so far. One was the history of Palestine. It was 
very well written, if a little mispelled. (Remember, we in the west are 
particular)&nbsp; The other was the guest books.<br>From 
this simple thing, I have determined something indefinitely useful. This is a 
Palestinian web site. Some people would<br>say that was 
stating the obvious. Sharon equals terrorist, does he? The Jewish people control 
the media here? Since when is that?<br>There are some 
truths to the things that have been said. But I believe that the main reason the 
US is still more supportive<br>to Israel than Palestine, if 
we are supportive of Palestine at all, is because of the Holocaust. I won't go 
further into that. I just find it extremely stupid that because all those Jews 
died half a century ago, the US must remain sympathetic to Israel, instead of 
being sympathetic to the people who are losing more lifes now: Palestinians. Out 
of all those killed by war in the Holy Land, the dead Palestinians outnumber the 
dead Jews around 5 to 1.<br>Now, I am not sure either of 
the reason I have given, nor the numbers, but wrong or right, I believe 
"Amurica", as Mr. Bush says, should either remain unbiased or get its nose out 
of other people's business. And the Palestinians should be given back at 
least&nbsp; the land that was partitioned to them by the UN, if not the whole 
country. <br>

been to an Israeli web site? Just wondering. You see, you guys say that the 
conflict is because of an illegal occupation of Israelis in Palestine. I tend to 
agree with you on that point. Israelis would probably say that it is their 
homeland, so they have every right to be there. Probably, I don't want to assume 
anything. Just think, within a hundred years it has gone from the Jews trying to 
establish a home in Palestine to the Palestinians trying to establish a home in 
Israel. How messed up is that?<br>

a Jew:<br><br>I know my opinions are 
not shared by all Jews, nor by many Muslim visitors to this guestbook, but 
comments like some on this page are heartwarming. There is no Jewish intention 
to hurt or kill Palestinians. These are the outcome of an Israeli policy to 
defend itself, just as many casualties accrue because of a Palestinian policy to 
do the same. The result doesn't change; people are dying and any true and good 
follower of any religion will be shedding tears. If we continually remind one 
another of the damage we inflict, the retributions and the misery continue. 
These are sad observations, not statements of intent. I continue to plead with 
every Jew and Muslim, and anybody concerned, to seek assistance in overcoming 
the ground war to build a future, and a history, we can all take pride in. If we 
are overcome with zeal, it does not take genius to see how we will all end up in 
the gutter no matter who claims victory and moral right. Begging you won't spit 
on my blessing, God bless us.<br>

best. This IS NOT to take up stones or available weapons, nor to be 'martyrs', 
as if our pictures are worth more than the great lives ahead of us. No. We must 
ensure the cooperation of all our neighbours - Muslim, Jewish and Christian, 
love them or hate them - to build funds for our schooling and food, support for 
our politics, and assurances that if we are not violent they cannot be either. 
We must have our religion and our needs, and friends where we can find them. 
That way we live to form our future generations, and to bestow on them a better 
life...<br>

understand why my country and others across the globe still support the unjust

its allies are afraid of zealots who murder behind the cloak of religion? Should 
they be afraid of those that commit atrocities in the name of Islam? I would 
like to think that the zealots are simply an ineffective minority who can only 
make their voices heard by committing heinous acts. I hope that they do not turn 
the tide of world opinion against Palestine and its people. <br><br>
