<p>Interim governing body appointed July 1994 to take over the management of
Palestinian affairs from Israel in newly liberated Gaza Strip and Jericho .
It is headed by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
organization. The PNA has jurisdiction over the whole of the formerly
occupied areas, except Israeli settlers and nationals , Israel retains
responsibility for external defence and foreign affairs.<br><br>
On 5 Dec 1994 Israel extended the PNA's remit to include administration of
health and collection of taxes. In the same month , the Israeli parliament
passed legislation allowing for the closure of PNA offices set up outside
the self-rule areas, notably Orient House in East Jerusalem.<br><br>
Since taking office, the PNA has had to contend with militant attacks by
Palestinian islamic groups within area of jurisdiction , directed at
Israeli soldiers .</p><br><br>
