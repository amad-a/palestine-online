<p>Since the Balfour
Declaration of 1917
(which endorsed the
idea of a Jewish
state within
Palestine), the
British government
had been struggling
to reconcile the
conflicting aspirations of Jews and Arabs in
Palestine, which Britain administered under a
League of Nations mandate . Those who still
believed in the possibility of peaceful
coexistence between the two groups got a grim
comeuppance in July 1937 when the Peel Commission,
headed by Lord Robert Peel, issued its report.
Basically, the commission concluded, the mandate
in Palestine was unworkable There was no hope of
any cooperative national entity there that
included both Arabs and Jews, . The impetus for
the commission's formation had been the most
recent spark of Palestinian violence. Riots and
Arab protests against the Jews in Palestine had
been escalating throughout the 1920s and '30s. In
the mid-1930s, in response to the thousands of
Jews who'd arrived from Europe, Palestinian Arabs
formed the Arab High Committee to defend
themselves against what they perceived as a Jewish
takeover A general strike exploded into a revolt.
Desperate for a solution, the British appointed
Lord Peel to study the situation. The Arab
leadership boycotted the study.<br><br>
After dismissing the possibility of Arab-Jewish
amity, the commission went on to recommend the
partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, an
Arab state, and a neutral sacred-site state to be
administered by Britain. Within two years, Britain
found itself in a no-win situation, and on the eve
of World War II issued the infamous "White Paper"
severely curtailing Jewish immigration into
Palestine.</p>
