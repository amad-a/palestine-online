Your website helps the struggle by showing the truth.  We will carry on the fight for a homeland.  We do not hide in caves and send our children to fight and die.  We are fighting a just cause and are not the same as the 9/11 cowards.  The world must know this!<br><hr>

Dear Mr. President and Mr. Powell;<br>
 <br>
Given the situation in Palestine, I find it very hard to believe that the Israeli's are still allowed to build homes inside Palestine territory. <br>
Yet, it is going on!  Mr. President, you and this administration seem to want to ignore this.  Terrorism is OK for the Israelis to perpetrate on the Palestinians!  Is it OK for the Israeli's to murder the people of Palestine?  Is it OK for Israeli's to destroy Palestinian homes? This past year that has happened 1,000 times!  This destruction is making refugees out of approximately 4500 men, woman, and children.  Is it OK for the Israelis to murder Palestinian children?  Who's policy is this, the United States?  Is this the dictated policy of what the Israeli's are going to do in Palestine!  In addition, we the United States are told to “Stay out of our murder Business!”<br>
 Its time to not only demand that terror is stopped on the Palestinian side, it is time to tell the Israelis that their Terrorism will not be tolerated either! If you do not think the actions of the Israelis are terrorism, I want to know what it is? It is not self-defense!  It is not protection of the illegal squatters inside Palestinian territory.  It is brutal terror on the men, woman, and children of everyday Palestinians. <br>
What side will have peace?  If you stop one side, you had better stop the other side from terror also!      <br>
 <br>
 The head of the Israeli settlement council in Gaza stated that construction is underway of [100] new housing units in Nisaneet, [15] new housing units in Moraj, [39] new housing units in Netzarim and [15] new housing units in Rafeeh Yam settlements.<br>

Living in Ireland i am quite distant from the conflict in Palestine but it is upsetting to see the plight of the Palestinian people. On observing events over the last few years it seems obivious that the approach of the Israli goverment is heavyhanded, and there only objective is to wipe out the Palestinians, is this not clear to other observers who have no vested interest in the situation?<br><hr>

This site opened my eyes a little wider today,I have been watching with growing disgust the way the Palestinian viewpoint has been ignored here in the west,yesterday was the real eye opener when watching cnn how one sided the media really is.People should  start learning the history of what has really happened in the middle east through history and not be swayed byu a bunch of bearocrats and politicians.This web site is a good example to start with!<br><hr>

So let me get this straight...you guys actually support terrorism? Wow...that's pretty dumb in this day and age. Been nice knowing you in that case. btw...no big fan of Israel either...you two REALLY deserve each other. I put my money on Israel, though, sorry...it is the smart bet. Their soldiers seem better trained. PS...the USMC usually strikes at dawn...just a heads up. See ya on the flip-side...if there is one for you folks. Over and out from a former supporter.<br><hr>

Interesting Link.<br>

<br>
Asks a very good question.  Do the Palestinian People want to fight or do they want to win?  The current method of fight will not win, only breed more fight.  Shaheed actions with explosives against Israel are bold, but they can only breed retaliation.  In addition they muddy the picture for the rest of the world. They make Israeli actions look like self defense whether they are or not. You may know what the Israeli actions really are, but you can't expect the U.S. and rest of world to sort it out.  Furthermore, the whole culture of martyrdom and recycled Nazi style anti Jewish rhetoric seems very satanic and foreign in the west, or in this country anyway.<br>
<br>
Massive peaceful protest will win more hearts, particularly if the Israeli's shoot peaceful protesters.  I think that the present US administration has potential to be fair to the Palestinian cause.  But this weekend's martyr explosions threatens to slant things back toward Israel.<br>
<br>
May God grant Peace and Justice in our time.<br><hr>

Question? Why are Palestinians called gunmen? And Isrealis not called terrorists? At this very moment the Israeli Army is bulldozing more homes in Rafah in the last year over one hundred homes in the name of security? This is terrorism at the Israeli level! Who, is going to stop them? The world had to stop the nazi's sixty years ago. The Israeli's are the same as nazi's now!<br>

The web site is beautiful and informative.  Because I am studying the Middle East conflicts, the history of Christianity, Islam, and Judiasm, and the roots of international hatred, the information and links on the web site provide a variety of resources.  The synopsis of the history of Palestine is very useful.  It filled holes in my personal information and gave me avenues to research.  I thank you. <br><hr>

good effort....but the photo gallery of people is really poor...its not good as it should be ..some people's photos should be deleted and must be put instead the photos of more patriot people...and there's no need to put the photo of the peace agreement..because its a useless one and therefore noone cares about it.Moreover, in your site you mentioned and explained about the palestinain cities in West Bank and Gaza strip..but what about the cities...the originally palestinain cities that are under the occupation of israel?why didn't you mention them?have you forgotten them?if you forgot about them...then you would forget about all palestine...Palestine all so includes heifa and akka and many other cities that we"palestinians"will inshallah take them back from israelis...Freedom For Palestine Inshallah<br><hr>

during the conflict - Jews, Muslims, and any others. Above all, peace MUST reign. Lets get back to the table, let<br>
by-gones be by-gones and finally get the peace going again so we can all live like the neighbors we are!!<br><hr>

Amidst the current changes in World Politics taking place, there is hope that justice will be seen in Palestine eventually. I as a peaceloving Muslim congratulate the courage of Palestinians despite Israel's stubborn adherence to the sick barbaric policy of 'the old will die and the young will forget'. Well, after decades, it should be clear to hardliners such as Sharon that no human will forget how Jews crept into Palestine after conning us (the British) into making a blunder our politicians would like to forget. Jews arrived in hordes to find 'homes' after driving thousands of Palestinians homeless. It was then the 50 or so year old crsis in the Midlle East began. Now Tony Blair has decided to enter the scene and we are back. (Remember, eventhough the British went out of their way betraying Palestinians in the creation of Israel, it was the Jews themselves who turned against the British and played a big role in driving them out - Israelis are unreliable, to put it mildly!!). Yaser Arafat's determination will see the Palestinian people regaining their independence and rights, the UN Resolution 242 will be implemented whether Sharon likes it or not. Common people in the West are opening their eyes more for the sake of World Peace. They realise the only way to achieve global harmony is by dealing with Israel's blunt indifference to UN's resolutions and the occupation of Palestine. After the main objectives are dealt with ie:- Palestinie re-established as E. Jerusalem as the capital, state terrorism of Israel crimes against have been tried in International Court, then Israel have a better chance of presenting itself as a more credible state and delivering security to its citizens. <br>

A number of years ago I read the book 'From Beirut To Jerusalem' by Dr Ang Swee Chai...it brought tears to my eyes then and it still does everytime I read it. We in many other parts of the world do notice the plight of the Palestinian people...I have always included you in my prayers; GOD willing, you will have your Palestine again one day -in my lifetime, I hope...then my tears will be one of joy and not of sadness and despair.<br><hr>

Very educational site, well done keep up the good work!<br>
<br>
Are we so blinded by religious zealotry that we can't see that over the millenniums organized religion (no I don't mean spiritual belief in a supreme being) has caused far more pain and suffering than the good it is intended to bring?<br>
<br>
Can we not see that all religion was created by human beings interested in propagating their own agendas? Are we so foolish to believe any wise bearded male that comes back from a mountain with the 'word of god'?<br>
<br>
It is very sad, that in this time in human history we still fall prey to our primal insecurities and cling together like sheep being deceived by clever speakers and masterful writers urging us to hate our differences instead of embracing our individuality.<br>
<br>
I find myself somewhat dissappointed in humanity as a whole, watching century after century monkeys throwing crap at each other in the name of god, allah and many other deities we have invented over the years. Do we not have better things to do with our short time here on earth?<br>
<br>
My guess is if we were all able to put the religious issues aside, we would be able to see the political struggles around the world for what they are including the Palestine situation which is clearly a fight for freedom and independence.<br>
<br>

Thanks to you Esam Shashaa for your effort <br>
The world must know who are the terrorist in this area !<br>
 the primery minister in Israel (Sharon) who are killed 3 thousands<br>
 in one day from palestinians in SABRA &amp; SHATEELA refugee camp in 1982<br>
 and how are braek in Aqsa mosque  with out any respect to the muslim <br>&amp; Palestinian feeling OR how are struggle to defending thier country <br>
and for freedom .<br>
All the world must know the facts about Palestine ,We don't hate <br>
Americans, as the mattar of fact American people are nice but the<br>
media washes their brains by telling them bunch of lies completely<br>
different from reality. I just feel sorry for Americans being deceived<br>
everyday in their life by all these lies, and building hates in their hearts<br>
toward all muslims, Palestinians, and all arabs in general. <br>
for all the People how are asking us to "stop VIOLENCE against ISRAEL"<br>
tell me How can we accept occupation? how we can see him steal our <br>
land and destroy our houses to build settlment for the settler who are <br>
coming from out side palestine?  how can I let them destroy my life and <br>
kill my children without defending myself ? how can I accept to live like <br>
strangers in my country?????????????<br>
stop killing our children in palestine,stop destroying our life,<br>
stop living in our home , stop stealing our lands,stop trying to <br>
change facts..<br>
I hate who don't respect my humanity and my rights...I hate who call<br>
me terrorist for defending my land and my religion...WITH STONES..<br>
I hate war,but accept it when my enemy refuse the peace and talk me <br>
alone...<br>
we have the right to defend our country,we have the right to <br>
struggle...even if the ignorant call that"terrorism"..<br>
we not searching 4 war,but we searching 4 freedom and to life in peace..<br><hr>

I came to your site in hopes of understanding the history of Palestine. I'm catholic, married to a jew, and it is important to me to understand both sides. Why people would slaughter innocent people in the name of God? In the name of God? Whose God? Is there a holy book anywhere on this planet that says killing one another is acceptable? <br>
<br>
I read your history and still don't altogether understand where things went horribly awry in the region. I can see why both sides are passionate about the lands they fight over. I am curious why, in your map of the proposed site of the Palestine State, it includes the land it does? Why both Bethlehem and Jeruselem? Why one small spot on the west bank? I am genuinely curious. <br>
<br>
I leave all of you with one thought - could any of you who posted "maybe this will make america think" really be so ignorant of human emotions? Killing 5000 innocent people, people whose only mistake was going to work, living their lives, isn't going to make any of us sympathize with anyone. The only thing it's going to make most Americans think about how to make those who did this pay. <br>
<br>
Osama Bin Laden isn't a hero, he's a murderer of innocents. He's not the only one. Every religion, every country has their sick murderers, and it's a slap in the face of the peaceful God we all worship. It attempts to make God small, petty, angry. Osama Bin Laden is attempting to make his followers believe God picks one of his children over another. It makes no sense. <br>
<br>
Instead of looking at America is a rape victim that should have rethought the length of her skirt, you should look at these actions for what they really are. The attack and murder of innocent people that will do nothing more but cause more death. <br><hr>

With the serious consequences of international friction at the moment it behoves us all to educate ourselves as to the major issues and the Palestinian situation being one of the most important. Having grown up with a very basic understanding of the Palistinian - Israeli conflict, one swayed towards Israel through sympathy, based on the holocaust and some affinity through christianity it has been most eye opening to start to gain some knowledge through more rational and logical channels. My sympathy has changed but by gosh what a complex subject and area of the world. It certainly has over time been a pawn of the powerful, the individuals who get used on all sides are the people who deserve everyones concern. Fanatics such as the settlers who occupy Palestinian land and suicide bombers are a sympton of failed policies of those who purport their only concerns as the welfare of their people but as has been seen throughout history follow theirs and those that manipulate personal agendas. I'm learning that there is always two sides to an argument, with both sides having degrees of legitimacy. Thank you for an informed site with minimal bias<br>
