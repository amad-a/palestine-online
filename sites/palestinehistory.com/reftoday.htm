<p>Today the number of Palestinian total approximately 4.7 million
persons, of which 3.4 million are registered with the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(UNRWA). The largest concentration of Palestine refugees is in Jordan,
representing more than 40% of those refugees registered with UNRWA,
and the refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including
Jerusalem, represent 38% of UNRWA’s registration, Lebanon and Syria
each host about 10% of the registered refugees and the remainder live
in neighboring countries, including Egypt, while others have migrated
to Europe, the United States, Canada and South America.<br><br>
Since the creation of the State of Israel in Palestine, the Middle
East has been hot point of conflicts interrupted by full-scale wars
that threaten the peace of the world. For this reason alone, not to
mention principles of right and justice, it is an obligation upon
every state and individual to exert the limit of their influence to
secure a lasting and just settlement of this conflict. This requires
the restoration, to the Arab States, of their territory and to the
Palestinian people their legitimate and national rights in their
country. It is Israel's denial of these rights that form the
fundamental cause of this whole conflict.<br><br>
Bertrand Russell, in his last words before he died, spoke of these
rights in his message to the International Conference of
Parliamentarians held in February 1970: "The tragedy of the people of
Palestine is that their country was 'given' by a foreign power to
another people for the creation of a new state. The result was that
many hundreds of thousands of innocent people were made permanently
homeless. With every new conflict their numbers increased. How much
longer is the world willing to endure this spectacle of wanton
cruelty? It is abundantly clear that the refugees have every right to
the homeland from which they were driven, and the denial of this right
is at the heart of the continuing conflict."<br><br>
No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse
from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine
to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate? A permanent
just settlement of the refugees in their homeland is an essential
ingredient of any genuine settlement in the Middle East."</p><br>
