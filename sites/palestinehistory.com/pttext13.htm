<p>The population balance in the
new state of Israel was
drastically altered during the
1948 war. The armistice
agreements extended the
territory under Israel's
control beyond the UN partition
boundaries from approximately
15,500 to 20,700 sq km (about
6,000 to 8,000 sq mi).<br><br>
The small Gaza Strip on the Egypt-Israel border
was left under Egyptian control , and the West
Bank was controled by Jordan. Of the more than
800,000 Arabs who lived in Israeli-held territory
before 1948, only about 170,000 remained. The rest
became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries,
ending the Arab majority in the Jewish state.<br><br>
Israel's Provisional State Council organized
elections for the first Knesset (parliament) in
1949. Chaim Weizmann, the most prominent Zionist
leader of the prewar period, became the country's
first president.</p>
