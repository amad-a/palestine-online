<p>Shamir, (1915-...), served as prime minister of Israel from October 1983 to
September 1984, and from October 1986 to July 1992. As prime minister,
Shamir continued most of Israel's previously established foreign policies.
For example, he supported Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip (territories that Israeli troops had occupied in 1967).<br><br>
Shamir succeeded Menachem Begin as prime minister in 1983, after Begin had
resigned. He also replaced Begin as head of the political party called the
Likud bloc. Shamir had been foreign minister since 1980.<br><br>
In July 1984, parliamentary elections were held in Israel. No party won a
majority. In September, the Likud bloc and the Labor Party formed a unity
government that lasted for 50 months. Under the unity government agreement,
Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party, served as prime minister for 25
months. Shamir served as vice prime minister and foreign minister. Under
the agreement, the roles of Peres and Shamir were reversed after 25 months
in October 1986. In the elections of November 1988, no party won a
majority. In December, Likud and Labor formed a new coalition government.
Shamir remained prime minister.<br><br>
In 1987, protests by Palestinians in the occupied territories began.
Several hundred Palestinians and a smaller number of Israelis were killed.
In 1990, Shamir refused to compromise on peace plans for the territories.
The Labor Party then left the coalition, and the government fell in March.
In June 1990, Likud and small conservative parties formed a new coalition
government in Israel with Shamir as prime minister. The Labor Party won
control of the parliament in elections held in June 1992. In July, Labor
Party leader Yitzhak Rabin replaced Shamir as prime minister. Shamir
resigned as head of the Likud block in March 1993.<br><br>
Shamir was born in Ruzinoy, a village in eastern Poland. His last name was
Jazernicki. He later changed his name to Shamir, the Hebrew word for both
thistle and flint. He studied law in Warsaw before moving to Palestine in
1935 to attend Hebrew University. He dropped out in 1937 and joined the
Irgun Zvai Leumi, an underground Jewish terrorist militia that fought the
British (who then ruled Palestine) and the Palestinian Arabs.<br><br>
In 1940, Shamir joined the more radical Lohamei Herut Yisrael (Israel
Freedom Fighters), or Stern Gang, terrorist militia. Israel was created in
Palestine in 1948. From 1955 to 1965, Shamir worked for Mossad, Israel's
intelligence agency. He was first elected to the Knesset (Israeli
parliament) in 1973.</p><br><br>
