<p>11-16-2001<br><br>
LONDON (IRNA) - Representatives of a Jewish religious group has called for
the dismantlement of Israel as the root cause of tension and violence in the
Middle East.
<br><br>
The Neturei Karta representatives made the call at a one-day international
conference on terrorism attended by Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious
leaders and politicians here Tuesday.
<br><br>
A member of the group, J. Konig, elaborating on his statements at the
conference told IRNA: 'I want to see the dismantlement of the state and the
peaceful coexistence of Jews with Arabs and the Arab rule.'
<br><br>
He added: 'Like we live everywhere, like we live in London, like we live in
any part of the world, we just want to be citizens, we don't want to be
rulers.'
<br><br>
Another member of the group regretted the bad image' the Israeli government
has created of the Jews and caused world people to have a wrong impression
of Judaism.
<br><br>
Rabbi Grohman, a Netuei Karta leader, elaborated on the establishment of the
Zionist regime and said it was behind spread of corruption among a number of
Jews.
<br><br>
Condemning any act of violence which leads to loss of life of innocent
people, he considered establishment of Zionist government in the occupied
Palestine as a factor for outbreak of disputes between Muslims and Jews.
<br><br>
He added that before the establishment of the Zionist regime, Muslims,
Christians and Jews lived in peace in the Palestine region.
<br><br>
Neturei Karta has a considerable number of followers in Britain.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Rabbai Hershal Gluck, chairman of the Muslim-Jewish forum of the
UK, in his speech titled 'looking at the past through the prism of the
future', condemned terrorism as a phenomenon about destroying innocent
lives.
<br><br>
'Too many mothers have cried for the loss of their children, and too many
children for their parents,' he said, stressing: 'It is high time to look at
what divides us. It is time to call an end to the cycle.'
<br><br>
Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious leaders discussed the topic of
terrorism in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks on American targets in New
York and Washington.
<br><br>
The one-day international conference was sponsored by the Institute of
Islamic Studies affiliated to the Islamic Center of Britain.
<br><br>
Speakers including religious personalities, politicians, university
professors and intellectuals from Britain, the United States and Iran
expressed their viewpoints regarding terrorism and the current conflicts in
Afghanistan and the Middle East.
