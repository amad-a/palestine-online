<p>Several Jewish groups had been linked with terrorist attacks against Arabs
and British in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The best known of these
organizations, the Gush Emunim Underground (sometimes called the Jewish
Terror Organization), was formed in 1979 by prominent members of Gush
Emunim, a group of religious zealots who had used squatter tactics to carry
on a terrorist campaign to settle the West Bank after the October 1973 War.
The underground perceived the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 Treaty
of Peace Between Egypt and Israel as betraying the Begin government's
policy of retaining the territories conquered by Israel.<br><br>
The principal terrorist actions of the Gush Emunim Underground were carried
out between 1980 and 1984. In 1980 car bombings of five West Bank Arab
mayors resulted in crippling two of the mayors. In 1983, the Hebron Islamic
College was the target of a machine gun and grenade attack that killed three
Arab students and wounded thirty three others. In 1984 an attempt was made
to place explosive charges on five Arab buses in East Jerusalem. This plot
was foiled by agents of Israel's internal security force, Shin Bet, leading
to arrest and prison sentences for eighteen members of the underground. The
security services also uncovered a well-developed plan to blow up the Dome
of the Rock, one of Islam's most sacred shrines, on Al-Aqsa Mosque complex
in east Jerusalem's.</p><br><br>
