<p>By : Douglas L Perle<br><br>
Dear Mr. President and Mr. Powell;
<br><br>
Given  the  situation  in Palestine, I find it very hard to believe that the
Israeli's are still allowed to build homes inside Palestine territory.
<br><br>
Yet, it is going on! Mr. President, you and this administration seem to want
to ignore this. Terrorism is OK for the Israelis to perpetrate on the
Palestinians! Is it OK for the Israeli's to murder the people of Palestine?
Is it OK for Israeli's to destroy Palestinian homes? This past year that has
happened 1,000 time! Making refugees out of approximately 4500 men, woman,
and children. Is it OK for the Israeli's to murder Palestinian children?
How's policy is this, the United States? Or is this the dictated policy of
what the Israeli's are going to do in Palestine! And we the United States
are told to "Stay out of our murder Business!"
<br><br>
Its time to not only demand that terror is stopped on the Palestinian side,
it is time to tell the Israelis that their Terrorism will not be tolerated
either! If you don't think the actions of the Israelis is terrorism, I want
to know what it is? It is not self defense! It is not protection of the
illegal squatters inside Palestinian territory. It is brutal terror on the
men, woman, and children of everyday Palestinians.
<br><br>
What side will have peace? If you stop one side, you better shop the other
side from terror also!
<br><br>
The head of the Israeli settlement council in Gaza stated that construction
is underway of [100] new housing units in Nisaneet, [15] new housing units
in Moraj, [39] new housing units in Netzarim and [15] new housing units in
Rafeeh Yam settlements.
