<div align="center"><b>1947</b></div>
<p>Arab-Israeli conflicts have presented the United Nations with
some of its most difficult peace keeping problems.<br><br>
In 1947, the General Assembly approved a plan to divide
Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state and to make
Jerusalem an international city under UN control.<br><br>
Jerusalem is a holy city for Christians, and Muslims.<br><br>
About 90 percent of all Arabs are Muslims, and the land given
to Jewish was more then Arab, The Arab countries opposed the UN
plan .</p><br>

<p>On 14 May 1948, the United Kingdom relinquished its mandate
over Palestine. Israel was proclaimed. On the following day,
the Palestinians, together with the armies of Syria, Lebanon,
Egypt and Jordan, attacked the the proclaimed Israel , The
Arabs failed to prevent establishment of a Jewish state.<br><br>
In 1949, the war ended with four UN-arranged armistice
agreements between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and
Syria.<br><br>
The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO)
assisted the parties in complying with the provisions of these
agreements. However, border incidents continued.</p><br>

<p>Following the nationalization of the Suez Canal announced by Egypt on 26
July 1956, Israeli forces invaded Sinai, while British and French troops
landed at Suez at the end of October.<br><br>
On 4 November 1956, the General Assembly, meeting in special session,
called for a cease-fire and created the first peace-keeping force, the
United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), which supervised the progressive
withdrawal of the Israeli, British and French troops, patrolled the
demarcation line between Egypt and Israel, and brought relative quiet to
the area.</p><br>

<p>UNEF was withdrawn at Egypt’s request on 16 May 1967.<br><br>
On 5 June, war broke out again between Israel on
the one hand, and Egypt, Jordan and Syria on the
other. The Security Council called four times for
a cease-fire, which was eventually concluded on
11 June. At that date, Israel occupied Sinai, the
Gaza strip, the West Bank of the Jordan,
including East Jerusalem, and part of the Syrian
Golan Heights.The Security Council sent observers
to monitor the cease-fire.<br><br>
On 22 November 1967, the Council unanimously
adopted resolution 242, which laid down the
general principles for a peaceful and lasting
settlement; the withdrawal of Israeli armed
forces from territories occupied in the most
recent conflict; the termination of all claims or
states of belligerency.</p><br>
<center><img src="image/6daywar.gif" width=175 height=292 border=0 alt="1967"></center><br>
<p>Respect for and recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence of every state in the area; the guarantee of free
navigation through international waterways in the area; and the
establishment of demilitarized zones.</p><br>

<p>On 6 October 1973, October war started. On 24
October 1973 , the Security Council created
the second United Nations Emergency Force
(UNEF II).<br><br>
The deployment of 7,000 men from twelve
countries brought the October war to an end.</p><br>

<p>In 1974, the General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing the right of
Palestine Arabs, including those in Israel, to nationhood. A second
resolution gave observer status to the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), a group approved by Arab countries to represent the Palestinians.
Observer status gave the PLO the right to attend Assembly sessions but not
to take part in them.</p><br>

<p>In 1975, many Western nations were angered when the General Assembly passed
a resolution declaring that Zionism is "a form of racism." Zionism is the
Jewish movement that helped establish the state of Israel. The Assembly
repealed the resolution in 1991.</p><br>

<p>In 1978, Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. The two
countries also agreed on autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979. Egypt regained full control
of the Sinai Peninsula in 1982. However, no arrangement for autonomy for
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was made.</p><br>

<p>In 1993 and 1995, Israel and the PLO signed agreements that led to the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and most cities and towns
of the West Bank by early 1996. As the Israelis withdrew, Palestinians
became the governing authorities in these areas. Israel also recognized the
PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. In 1994, Jordan and
Israel signed a declaration that marked the end of a state of war that had
technically existed between them since 1948. In 1996, Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip and Palestinian-controlled parts of the West Bank elected a
president and legislature to make laws and administer these areas.</p><br>
