for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)</center>
<p>United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East (UNRWA), agency of the United Nations, established by the General
Assembly in December 1949 to provide relief and welfare services to
refugees from Palestine and their descendants, living both in and out of
refugee camps. The refugees, who lost their homes and their livelihoods as
a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948, constitute a continuing
problem between Israel and the Arab nations.<br><br>
At present more than 2.6 million Palestinian refugees are registered with
the agency. Only a small number of them receive direct aid, such as the
distribution of food. UNRWA's main functions in the 1980s and 1990s have
been to provide health care at the clinics and health centers run by the
agency and educational services at UNRWA schools.<br><br>
The agency is under the direction of a commissioner general and a
10-member-nation advisory commission. It maintains headquarters in Vienna
and Amman, Jordan.</p><br><br>
