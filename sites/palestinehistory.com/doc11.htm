Resolutions of the Palestine National Council<br><br>
July 1-17, 1968<br><br>
Article 1:<br><br>
Palestine is the homeland of the Arab Palestinian people; it is
an indivisible part of the Arab homeland, and the Palestinian
people are an integral part of the Arab nation.<br><br>
Article 2:<br><br>
Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the British
Mandate, is an indivisible territorial unit.<br><br>
Article 3:<br><br>
The Palestinian Arab people possess the legal right to their
homeland and have the right to determine their destiny after
achieving the liberation of their country in accordance with
their wishes and entirely of their own accord and will.<br><br>
Article 4:<br><br>
The Palestinian identity is a genuine, essential, and inherent
characteristic; it is transmitted from parents to children. The
Zionist occupation and the dispersal of the Palestinian Arab
people, through the disasters which befell them, do not make
them lose their Palestinian identity and their membership in
the Palestinian community, nor do they negate them.<br><br>
Article 5:<br><br>
The Palestinians are those Arab nationals who, until 1947,
normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were
evicted from it or have stayed there. Anyone born, after that
date, of a Palestinian father - whether inside Palestine or
outside it - is also a Palestinian.<br><br>
Article 6:<br><br>
The Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the
beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered
Palestinians.<br><br>
Article 7:<br><br>
That there is a Palestinian community and that it has material,
spiritual, and historical connection with Palestine are
indisputable facts. It is a national duty to bring up
individual Palestinians in an Arab revolutionary manner. All
means of information and education must be adopted in order to
acquaint the Palestinian with his country in the most profound
manner, both spiritual and material, that is possible. He must
be prepared for the armed struggle and ready to sacrifice his
wealth and his life in order to win back his homeland and bring
about its liberation.<br><br>
Article 8:<br><br>
The phase in their history, through which the Palestinian
people are now living, is that of national (watani) struggle
for the liberation of Palestine. Thus the conflicts among the
Palestinian national forces are secondary, and should be ended
for the sake of the basic conflict that exists between the
forces of Zionism and of imperialism on the one hand, and the
Palestinian Arab people on the other. On this basis the
Palestinian masses, regardless of whether they are residing in
the national homeland or in diaspora (mahajir) constitute -
both their organizations and the individuals - one national
front working for the retrieval of Palestine and its liberation
through armed struggle.<br><br>
Article 9:<br><br>
Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine. This it
is the overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase. The
Palestinian Arab people assert their absolute determination and
firm resolution to continue their armed struggle and to work
for an armed popular revolution for the liberation of their
country and their return to it . They also assert their right
to normal life in Palestine and to exercise their right to
self-determination and sovereignty over it.<br><br>
Article 10:<br><br>
Commando action constitutes the nucleus of the Palestinian
popular liberation war. This requires its escalation,
comprehensiveness, and the mobilization of all the Palestinian
popular and educational efforts and their organization and
involvement in the armed Palestinian revolution. It also
requires the achieving of unity for the national (watani)
struggle among the different groupings of the Palestinian
people, and between the Palestinian people and the Arab masses,
so as to secure the continuation of the revolution, its
escalation, and victory.<br><br>
Article 11:<br><br>
The Palestinians will have three mottoes: national (wataniyya)
unity, national (qawmiyya) mobilization, and liberation.<br><br>
Article 12:<br><br>
The Palestinian people believe in Arab unity. In order to
contribute their share toward the attainment of that objective,
however, they must, at the present stage of their struggle,
safeguard their Palestinian identity and develop their
consciousness of that identity, and oppose any plan that may
dissolve or impair it.<br><br>
Article 13:<br><br>
Arab unity and the liberation of Palestine are two
complementary objectives, the attainment of either of which
facilitates the attainment of the other. Thus, Arab unity leads
to the liberation of Palestine, the liberation of Palestine
leads to Arab unity; and work toward the realization of one
objective proceeds side by side with work toward the
realization of the other.<br><br>
Article 14:<br><br>
The destiny of the Arab nation, and indeed Arab existence
itself, depend upon the destiny of the Palestine cause. From
this interdependence springs the Arab nation's pursuit of, and
striving for, the liberation of Palestine. The people of
Palestine play the role of the vanguard in the realization of
this sacred (qawmi) goal.<br><br>
Article 15:<br><br>
The liberation of Palestine, from an Arab viewpoint, is a
national (qawmi) duty and it attempts to repel the Zionist and
imperialist aggression against the Arab homeland, and aims at
the elimination of Zionism in Palestine. Absolute
responsibility for this falls upon the Arab nation - peoples
and governments - with the Arab people of Palestine in the
vanguard. Accordingly, the Arab nation must mobilize all its
military, human, moral, and spiritual capabilities to
participate actively with the Palestinian people in the
liberation of Palestine. It must, particularly in the phase of
the armed Palestinian revolution, offer and furnish the
Palestinian people with all possible help, and material and
human support, and make available to them the means and
opportunities that will enable them to continue to carry out
their leading role in the armed revolution, until they liberate
their homeland.<br><br>
Article 16:<br><br>
The liberation of Palestine, from a spiritual point of view,
will provide the Holy Land with an atmosphere of safety and
tranquility, which in turn will safeguard the country's
religious sanctuaries and guarantee freedom of worship and of
visit to all, without discrimination of race, color, language,
or religion. Accordingly, the people of Palestine look to all
spiritual forces in the world for support.<br><br>
Article 17:<br><br>
The liberation of Palestine, from a human point of view, will
restore to the Palestinian individual his dignity, pride, and
freedom. Accordingly the Palestinian Arab people look forward
to the support of all those who believe in the dignity of man
and his freedom in the world.<br><br>
Article 18:<br><br>
The liberation of Palestine, from an international point of
view, is a defensive action necessitated by the demands of
self-defense. Accordingly the Palestinian people, desirous as
they are of the friendship of all people, look to
freedom-loving, and peace-loving states for support in order to
restore their legitimate rights in Palestine, to re-establish
peace and security in the country, and to enable its people to
exercise national sovereignty and freedom.<br><br>
Article 19:<br><br>
The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the establishment of the
state of Israel are entirely illegal, regardless of the passage
of time, because they were contrary to the will of the
Palestinian people and to their natural right in their
homeland, and inconsistent with the principles embodied in the
Charter of the United Nations, particularly the right to
self-determination.<br><br>
Article 20:<br><br>
The Balfour Declaration, the Mandate for Palestine, and
everything that has been based upon them, are deemed null and
void. Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with
Palestine are incompatible with the facts of history and the
true conception of what constitutes statehood. Judaism, being a
religion, is not an independent nationality. Nor do Jews
constitute a single nation with an identity of its own; they
are citizens of the states to which they belong.<br><br>
Article 21:<br><br>
The Arab Palestinian people, expressing themselves by the armed
Palestinian revolution, reject all solutions which are
substitutes for the total liberation of Palestine and reject
all proposals aiming at the liquidation of the Palestinian
problem, or its internationalization.<br><br>
Article 22:<br><br>
Zionism is a political movement organically associated with
international imperialism and antagonistic to all action for
liberation and to progressive movements in the world. It is
racist and fanatic in its nature, aggressive, expansionist, and
colonial in its aims, and fascist in its methods. Israel is the
instrument of the Zionist movement, and geographical base for
world imperialism placed strategically in the midst of the Arab
homeland to combat the hopes of the Arab nation for liberation,
unity, and progress. Israel is a constant source of threat
vis-a-vis peace in the Middle East and the whole world. Since
the liberation of Palestine will destroy the Zionist and
imperialist presence and will contribute to the establishment
of peace in the Middle East, the Palestinian people look for
the support of all the progressive and peaceful forces and urge
them all, irrespective of their affiliations and beliefs, to
offer the Palestinian people all aid and support in their just
struggle for the libera<br><br>
Article 23:<br><br>
The demand of security and peace, as well as the demand of
right and justice, require all states to consider Zionism an
illegitimate movement, to outlaw its existence, and to ban its
operations, in order that friendly relations among peoples may
be preserved, and the loyalty of citizens to their respective
homelands safeguarded.<br><br>
Article 24:<br><br>
The Palestinian people believe in the principles of justice,
freedom, sovereignty, self-determination, human dignity, and in
the right of all peoples to exercise them.<br><br>
Article 25:<br><br>
For the realization of the goals of this Charter and its
principles, the Palestine Liberation Organization will perform
its role in the liberation of Palestine in accordance with the
Constitution of this Organization.<br><br>
Article 26:<br><br>
The Palestine Liberation Organization, representative of the
Palestinian revolutionary forces, is responsible for the
Palestinian Arab people's movement in its struggle - to
retrieve its homeland, liberate and return to it and exercise
the right to self-determination in it - in all military,
political, and financial fields and also for whatever may be
required by the Palestine case on the inter-Arab and
international levels.<br><br>
Article 27:<br><br>
The Palestine Liberation Organization shall cooperate with all
Arab states, each according to its potentialities; and will
adopt a neutral policy among them in the light of the
requirements of the war of liberation; and on this basis it
shall not interfere in the internal affairs of any Arab state.<br><br>
Article 28:<br><br>
The Palestinian Arab people assert the genuineness and
independence of their national (wataniyya) revolution and
reject all forms of intervention, trusteeship, and
subordination.<br><br>
Article 29:<br><br>
The Palestinian people possess the fundamental and genuine
legal right to liberate and retrieve their homeland. The
Palestinian people determine their attitude toward all states
and forces on the basis of the stands they adopt vis-a-vis to
the Palestinian revolution to fulfill the aims of the
Palestinian people.<br><br>
Article 30:<br><br>
Fighters and carriers of arms in the war of liberation are the
nucleus of the popular army which will be the protective force
for the gains of the Palestinian Arab people.<br><br>
Article 31:<br><br>
The Organization shall have a flag, an oath of allegiance, and
an anthem. All this shall be decided upon in accordance with a
special regulation.<br><br>
Article 32:<br><br>
Regulations, which shall be known as the Constitution of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization, shall be annexed to this
Charter. It will lay down the manner in which the Organization,
and its organs and institutions, shall be constituted; the
respective competence of each; and the requirements of its
obligation under the Charter.<br><br>
Article 33:<br><br>
This Charter shall not be amended save by [vote of] a majority
of two-thirds of the total membership of the National Congress
of the Palestine Liberation Organization [taken] at a special
session convened for that purpose.<br><br>
