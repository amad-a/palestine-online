<p>Bethlehem (pop. 16,313) is the birthplace of Jesus Christ. It lies about 5
miles (8 kilometers) south of Jerusalem in a region of the Middle East
called the West Bank.<br><br>
The Arabic name is Bayta lahm, which means house of meat. Bethlehem is
chiefly a religious shrine. It has many houses of worship and other
religious institutions.<br><br>
In 1917, during World War I, British forces led by General Edmund Henry
Hynman Allenby took the town. It became under Jordan control in 1948 after
the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948 . Israel occupied the West Bank,
including Bethlehem, during the Six-Day War of 1967. In 1995, Israel
withdrew from Bethlehem and gave control to Palestinian based on self-rule
agreement between PLO and Israel.</p><br>
