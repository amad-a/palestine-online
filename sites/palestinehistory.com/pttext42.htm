<p>The Jews of the
Russian empire had
been oppressed for
centuries, and
though the pogroms
ended under Soviet
rule, discrimination
did not. Fearing international embarrassment and a "brain
drain" of skilled workers, MOSCOW had long
restricted emigration. But in the 1970s, detente
brought a loosening of curbs. The exodus peaked in
1979 , when more then 51,000 exit visas were
issued.<br><br>
The sharp increase, coinciding with the conclusion
of the second U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT II) , was widely seen as an
attempt to influence treaty ratification. A second
Soviet foreign policy goal to achieve most favored
nation status with the United States was equally
important: In 1979, US officials were considering
repeal of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a 1974 law
that tied trade grants to free emigration.
<br><br>
Even as emigration soared, the Kremlin cracked
down on Jewish activism-reviling refuseniks (the
term for those refused permission to leave) as
"agents of world Zionism" and sentencing many to
long terms in labor camps or psychiatric
institutions. The 1977 arrest of Anatoly
Shcharansky, a young mathematician who'd talked
openly with Western reporters about his failure to
gain an exit permit, generated international
outrage. Charged with spying for the CIA,
Shcharansky was convicted in a closed trial, and
served nine years in prison before being released
to Israel as part of a spy exchange. His case was
extraordinary only in the attention it drew.<br><br>
Watchdog groups estimated that by 1979, some
180,000 Soviet Jews had filed for visas, yet
emigration plummeted the following year, when SALT
II failed to be ratified and the Carter
administration - reacting to the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan - imposed a grain embargo. By 1984,
the number of emigres had slumped to 896.</p>
