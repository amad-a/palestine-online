<p>The 1958 merger of Syria and Egypt into the United
Arab Republic was the first of a series of
dramatic realignments throughout the Middle East,
inspired by the vision of Gamal Abdal Nasser.
Syria had been moving in the Egyptian dictator's
ideological direction since the fall of a rightist
military regime in 1954: the new junta , dominated
by the socialist Ba'ath party , had followed
Egypt in recognizing Mao's China and acquiring
Soviet arms, Squeezed between Washington ( which
backed anti-Soviet Arab governments against their
nonaligned neighbors ) and a growing domestic
Communist movement, Syria's leaders decided to
put their pan-Arabist notions to the test.National
borders, after all,were a Western invention: Syria
would lose nothing and gain untold strength by
melding with dynamic Egypt.<br><br>
More changes followed quickly. Yemen, though ruled
by a conservative monarch, sought security by
affiliating itself with the U.A.R. in a
confederation called the United Arab States, The
Western oriented kingdom of Iraq and Jordan formed
a rival union. In Saudi Arabia, King Saud was
forced to cede authority to his relatively
pro-Egyptian brother Faisal after being implicated
in a plot on Nasser's life. In Lebanon, civil war
erupted between Syrian-backed Arab nationalists
and supporters of pro-Western president Camille
Chamoun. In Iraq, when Premier Nuri al-Said
decided to aid Chamoun, pro-Egyptian officers
revolted-killing Said along with King Faisal II
and most of the royal family. The Iraqi-Jordanian
federation was no more.<br><br>
Fearing the spread of Nasserism to Lebanon, the
United States sent 10,000 troops and sponsored
talks between the warring factions. A compromise
led to elections, and General Fuad Chehab less
enthusiastically pro-Western and friendlier to
Nasser than Chamoun became president.<br><br>
Except for Jordan, all the Arab nations had now
fallen more or less into Cairo's camp. But they
soon fell out again. Iraq's strongman, Abdul Karim
Kassem, developed a bitter personal rivalry with
his Egyptian counterpart . The Syrians came to
resent Nasser's authoritarianism, while the Saudis
and Yemen resisted his socialism . And by 1961 ,
when Syria seceded from the U.A.R. , Arab unity
lay in ruins.</p>
