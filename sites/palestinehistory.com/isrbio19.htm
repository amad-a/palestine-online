Ehud "Brug" Barak is Israel's most highly decorated soldier . Barak was
born in 1942 in Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon. He earned a bachelor's degree in
physics and mathematics from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a masters
degree in economic-engineering systems from Stanford University.<br><br>
He was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1959. Barak served as a
commander in many of Israel's wars, including the 1967 Six Day War and the
1973 October War. In 1991, he became the 14th chief of the General Staff
and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, the highest in the
Israeli military. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and four
other citations for bravery and excellence.<br><br>
A hallmark of Barak's military career was his involvement in the political
process. He helped finalize the 1994 peace treaty with Jordan and also
played a key role in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. Barak was critical of the
Oslo talks but has argued that Israel should keep moving forward in a
realistic manner on the path to peace.<br><br>
In 1995, Barak left the military and joined the government of Yitzhak Rabin
as minister of the interior. Before his appointment, he was accused of
deserting wounded soldiers during a secret military exercise in 1992. An
investigation exonerated him from the allegations of misconduct.<br><br>
After Rabin was assassinated, Barak was appointed foreign minister in the
administration of Shimon Peres.<br><br>
Barak was elected Labor leader in 1997, Barak's leadership solidified after
the Knesset called for early elections.</p><br><br>
