<p>In Feb.1994 , An American-born Jewish settler in
Hebron , Baruch Goldstein , opened fire in a
al-Haram al-Ebrahime crowded mosque, killing 29
Muslims and wounding 150 more. Additional Muslims
were crushed to death in the panic to flee the
mosque and in rioting that followed. The attacker
used an assault rifle to shoot at more than 400
Muslims, who were in the mosque for early morning
prayers during the holy month of Ramadan. The
mosque itself was part of a complex of buildings
sacred to both Jews and Muslims, because it was
believed to contain the 4,000-year-old burial tomb
of Abraham & his wife Sarah.As such, the place had
long been a site for religious confrontations.
News of the massacre immediately led to riots in
Hebron and the rest of the occupied territories.
The crime called into question the possibility of
continuing the peace talks between Israel, the
Palestinians, Jordan, and Syria. In late 1993
Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization
had signed an agreement designed to bring peace
between the two group.</p>
