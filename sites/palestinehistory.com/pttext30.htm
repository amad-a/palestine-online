<p>In Sept. 24 , Israeli and Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) officials meeting in Taba,
Egypt, finalized agreement on the second stage of
eventual Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian
lands. Under the pact, which was officially signed
on September 28 in Washington, D.C., Israeli
forces were scheduled to be removed from six Arab
cities and 400 villages in the West Bank by early
1996, after which elections would be held for a
82-member Palestinian council, which would possess
legislative and executive power in the West Bank
and Gaza.<br><br>
Special arrangements were agreed upon for the West
Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli soldiers will
remain to protect the 450 Jewish settlers living
there. Disagreement over the status of Hebron
almost scuttled the agreement, and it took almost
a week of non-stop negotiations between PLO leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres to resolve the issue.<br><br>
The pact was the second stage in a three-step
process agreed upon in the Declaration of
Principles, a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy signed by the PLO and Israel in September
1993. The first phase in the process was finalized
in May 1994, when an accord was signed in Cairo,
Egypt, for the pullout of Israeli troops from the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho and
the handing over of administrative duties to the
Palestinian National Authority, led by Arafat. The
third stage will tackle such contentious issues as
the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Israeli
settlers, and the final borders between Israel and
the Palestinian state that many analysts believe
is close to becoming a reality. Negotiations
concerning the last phase of the peace process
were scheduled to begin in May 1996, with any
agreement to be implemented before the end of the
century.</p>
