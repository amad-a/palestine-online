Dear President Bush,
<br><br>
As a Citizen and one who has formerly served my country in wartime. This
brings me no pleasure having to voice my opinion on this subject. For many
years I have studied the Jewish state of Israel and I have admired them for
their strength and will to be a “State”. However, I have since looked at the
Israeli state from the other side of the coin. The picture is not so perfect
or beautiful and it has the ring of terror from the distant past. Terror
that the Jewish people themselves went through. The Jewish people are now
terrorizing the Arab people. With so much military power as to be able to
murder at will anyone they choose. We, the United States of America, are
disgraced by our continued support of such atrocities. We claim to support
Human Rights. Who's Human? And who's Rights?
<br><br>
We, complain about China violating the Human Rights of their people? Yes!
Why, then are we supporting a Nation that sees the Palestinians as
non-persons with no rights and no nationality? A People of our Earth with as
much Right to exist as the Israelis! Why are we not beating our swords
against this atrocity? This is far worse than a Communist takeover of South
Viet Nam. This is willful and wanton support of not just violations of Human
Rights but murder of a nation of People.
<br><br>
I know Mr. President you are trying to be a responsible person and not
someone's plastic do as your told puppet. However, after many years of
watching each of the Presidents of my Country sidestep this issue I believe
firmly that Israel owns the United States of America! The influence they
have is directly proportional to the amount of Money we pour over the nation
of Israel! I say it now and again in this letter. If the United States of
America really wants to stop the butchering in the Middle East cut off the
purse strings to all parties.
<br><br>
The comments that follow are from a hero of mine. A person I look up to as a
true patriot of his country. However, this statement is why I question
Israel's true purpose in occupation of a foreign land.
<br><br>
“Civilian Israeli settlements throughout the territories are essential to
Israel’s permanent military control over the territories. Not because they
can ensure security better than the army, but because without them we cannot
keep the army in those territories. Without them the IDF is a foreign army
ruling a foreign population” rather than an army defending the “right” of
the citizens to live in their homeland in peace and security. Moshe Dayan
<br><br>
There are no accidents in the Israeli plans. From the planned expulsion in
1948 of the Palestinians people. The massacre at Dair Yassen in 1948,
designed to put fear into all Palestinian people. To the 1967 six-day war a
preemptive strike. And the planned massacres at Sabra and Shatila refugee
camps in 1982. Also, the Israeli planned crushing of the Palestinian Intafada
that has failed. Now, the plan is combined with the Moshe Dayans idea.
Occupy the land; claim you are defending your people. Make laws that
racially discriminate against Arabs, any and all Arabs. This law making has
been going on for 53 years! Make the laws impossible for Arabs to comply
with by denial of permits to build etc.
<br><br>
Then when it is deemed needed the Israeli Army can and will bulldoze
Palestinian homes that do not have the Israeli permit on ground that it is
protecting its people in an occupied land of Palestine.
<br><br>
In only one example, in between Deir Al Balah and Gaza City, Israeli
bulldozers have razed a 30-meter wide strip of land from the edge of the
Gaza Strip down to the sea. Trees, houses, anything in the way have been
reduced to a dusty path for re-invasion at a later date.
<br><br>
As many as 18 homes were demolished in Rafah on June 23, 2001 when the
Israeli army entered Maghazi Camp at approximately 3 A.M., firing on the
residential area with tanks before moving in with bulldozers. Another three
homes were demolished in the Mighraqa region, also in the southern Gaza
Strip.
<br><br>
The U.S. criticizes Israel only when it commits acts embarrassing to the
United States! Continuing to supply Israel with vast and unconditional
military and economic support that guarantees Israeli violence and
aggression will continue.
<br><br>
If the United States of America wants peace in the Middle East it only has
to close the purse strings to all parties involved. The U.S. fails to
standup for Human rights violations or even mention such acts. Including
reported torture, prison terms for Palestinians attempting to get the truth
out about what is really going on. How, the Israelis will take as long as
need to “eliminate all foreign resistance”. Even “murdering every last
Palestinian” a family at a time! , so as not to create any notice by the
world outside of Israel. This plan may take years or a thousand years. To
create the racists state of New Israel without any Arabic population what so
ever!
<br><br>
This statement that follows from Mr. Sharon is typical of the Israeli
contempt of our country! Mr. President, as a Leader of The United States of
America why did not someone reply to this statement?
<br><br>
“No one in this world has the right to put Israel on trial. No one. On the
contrary, Israel may have the right to put others on trial, but certainly no
one has the right to put the Jewish people and the state of Israel on
trial."
<br><br>
This was Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, response to a U.S.
commission investigating the causes of violence in his country. This appears
to be the truth as the United States of America bows to Israel's total
disregard for United Nations resolution after resolution.
<br><br>
This tells me that the Israeli's own the American Government. That We the
American Public have no voice! As no Nation other than Israel has a voice.
We are shunned away as insignificant to these self-righteous bigots. Our
political leaders in the past have sold the Freedom of Others for the
interests of the Israeli's.
<br><br>
The real cause of the “uprising” September 28, 2000 was a long list of
Israeli butchering and bulling. And the straw that broke the camels back was
the Al-Aqsa Mosque incident.
<br><br>
We, the American Citizens do not hear the truth out of the Middle East. The
News is scrubbed and washed with Israeli bios that point away from Israel to
the Arab Nations and Palestinians. When the real cause is the United States
continued supply of massive arms. That no Nation, other than the United
States has? Except for Israel, WHY?
<br><br>
The “WHY”, Israelis own the Arms manufacturing, Banking, and political
systems of My Country!! And our own Government is POWERLESS. Thus we turn
our backs on the human rights violations. We do not pretend to ignore that
the Israeli Government is systematically “Eliminating the opposition”. We
bow to the Israelis and cow tow to the continued atrocities perpetrated by
Israel on the people of the Occupied territories. Occupied Territories, the
United Nations and all other Nations condemn.
<br><br>
"The site [of the Al-Aqsa mosque] is also sacred to the Jews and [Ariel]
Sharon wanted to assert their claim. He did not just visit, however. He and
hundreds of police invaded the walled compound. Israeli police beat
Palestinian officials who tried to bar the doors to the Al-Aqsa mosque."
<br><br>
-Marie Colvin, London Sunday Times, October 8, 2000
<br><br>
Sources in Jerusalem revealed that, incredibly, it was Barak who gave the
green light for Ariel Sharon, Netanyahu's successor as leader of the
rightwing Likud party, to visit Haram al-Sharif, the Islamic holy site in
the Old City on September 28, that set off the current wave of violence.
<br><br>
Mr. President
<br><br>
I Believe someone more powerful than the Israelis has to say, STOP IT! And
mean it with authority! And willingness to backup the Rights of All People
not just the Israeli Rights!
<br><br>
Thanks You Mr. President
