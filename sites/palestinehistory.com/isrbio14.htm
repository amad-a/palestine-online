<p>Begin, (1913-1992), served as prime minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983.
The leader of the conservative Likud Party, he came to power after the
party won a majority of the seats in the Knesset (Israeli parliament).
After the 1981 elections, the Likud Party and smaller conservative parties
formed a coalition, and Begin remained prime minister. Begin resigned from
office in 1983.<br><br>
In 1978, Begin, President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, and President Jimmy
Carter held discussions in the United States about ways to end the
Arab-Israeli conflict. The discussions resulted in a major agreement that
included plans for Israel's withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The
agreement also called for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. In
addition, the agreement provided for Palestinian autonomy in two
Israel-occupied territories the West Bank, formerly ruled by Jordan; and
the Gaza Strip, formerly administered by Egypt. Begin and Sadat shared the
1978 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The treaty was signed in 1979. Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula
was completed in 1982. Israel began to provide for Palestinian autonomy in
1994.<br><br>
In 1981, Begin's government claimed legal and political authority over
Syria's Golan Heights. Syria and many other countries denounced this claim.
Israel had gained control of the area in a war against Syria in 1967.
Although Israel's relations with Egypt improved under Begin, relations with
other Arab nations remained hostile. For more details on the Arab-Israeli
conflict.<br><br>
Begin was born in Brest, Litovsk, Russia (now Brest, Belarus). In the
1930's, he became active in the Zionist movement. The Zionists called for
the creation of a Jewish nation in Palestine, which was then ruled by the
British. Begin moved to Palestine in 1942. There he joined the Irgun Zvai
Leumi, an underground Jewish terrorist militia that fought the British and
the Palestinian Arabs. He led the Irgun from 1944 to 1948, when Israel was
created in Palestine. He played a leading military role in the Arab-Israeli
war of 1948. He served in the Knesset from 1949 to 1984.</p><br><br>
