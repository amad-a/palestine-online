<p>First of all, as an Arab Muslim Palestinian I would 
like to express my deep condolences to the American people for the tragedy 
and the criminal act of 11'th of September 2001. I also would like to 
denounce all type of violence and terrorism against the civilians from any 
nationality and in any place in the earth. The criminals shall be subject for a 
far trial and a punishment in the size of there action.</p>
<div align=center><strong><font color=#003399 size=6>Who did it ?</font></strong></div>
<p>This question is very simple to ask, very hard to answer.. you can't ask dead people, and any one you suspect can't defend himself. A very powerful fully controlled media are pushing the world to the edge for another endless round of wars and violence.  America is being targeted in the heart by terror , but who did it ? and why ?<br><br>
First of all, I am writing this because I have received hundreds of mails from USA and around the world, with notes about how America will take revenge from Islam, Bin Laden and Arab. The senders express their reaction of the attacks describing their anger and their view about Islam and Muslims as a race of human (or less) who do only killing and enjoy the death of others. But is it true? or is it the right time to take this judgment ? It is confirmed yet that the terrorists are Muslims and / or Arab? Even if the Islamic radicals did it, can we say that all Muslims are killers and enjoy killing and death?<br><br>
The USA government and Media claims that the main suspect is Usama Bin Ladan and his group, and they declare war against terrorism and the countries or groups support it. The American people are ready for war and willing to support their government actions against terrorism. The rest of the world is also supporting the USA in their plan. But we have yet to answer the question who did it first?<br><br><strong>
They said that 19 Arab Muslims on board of the Hijacked Airplanes are suspected to be part of Bin Ladan group. 
·	Do they have any proof.<br></strong><br>
·	How they entered to USA if the authorities suspect that their are linked to Bin ladan group.<br><br>
·	One of the names, spoke to Saudi Arabia authorities from his Home is Riyadh and he never visited USA.<br><br>
·	Another UAE national lost his passport two years back and he reported the case to the local authorities. <br><br>
·	One Egyptian as per his German friend was descent and never talk about politics. <br><br>
·	Another Saudi, a father of four children's and living a very happy family live.<br><br>
·   USA said that some of them were seen drinking beer days before the tragedy, everybody knows that Muslims don't drink Alcohols specials 'the Islamic groups' since it is not allowed by Islam. <br><br>
·   They said they found flying instructions books about planes in Arabic and then they said they have been trained in USA. Then why they have the books in Arabic and from where.<br><br>
<strong>USA authorities and Media said that Bin Ladan is the main suspect and therefore they are preparing a war against him and the countries support him…</strong><br><br>
·   What	about the legal role of "the  suspect in innocent until proven guilty." ?<br><br>
·	How come they can execute the penalty before even finalizing the investigation and without a trial?<br><br>· Where is the official report of findings of the investigations?<br><br>
·   How details are the investigation and who are the other suspects ?<br><br>
·	How they can claim that dead people may be linked to Bin Ladan group?<br><br>
·   Is	it possible that Bin Ladan has the experience to organize such a very complicated operation?<br><br>
·	Is it possible that Bin Ladan has capable people to carry out this operation?<br><br>
·	Is it that easy for a lousy organized group to hijacked four Airplanes from different Airports at same time?<br><br>
·	Is it possible that Bin Ladan has people in USA to corporate with him to facilitate the entrance of such big number of terrorists to the plans?<br><br>
·	Where is the security of the Airports?<br><br>
·	Is it possible that Bin Ladan has all that power and presence in USA without the government knowledge?<br><br>
·	Do the USA government know about them? If yes, why they did not stop them?<br><br>
We can easily conclude that such massive action is out of Bin Ladan capabilities and he can't be the organizer of this attacks. If America insists of accusing him they have to prove to the world their claims before set a trial for him.
<br><br><strong>Even if we accept (for the discussion) that Bin Ladan is the one who plan it and his people are the one who execute it.<br></strong><br>
·	Would that means to declare the war on all Muslims and Arabs.<br><br>
·	Would that mean all Muslims are killers and enjoy killing. <br><br>
·	The American media is pushing towards a general clash between Islam and the Western world, they forgot that there are huge community of American Muslims (most of the them are not from Arab origins).<br><br>
·	What about Muslims in Europe and Far East. <br><br>
·	What about Muslims in Middle East countries considered by USA as friends.  <br><br>
·	What about Millions of Muslims condemned the radical groups terrorism.  <br><br>
Please note that all true Muslims are peace-loving humans, they want to live in peace and friendship with all nations of the world, we are severing a lot and daily, and when someone know how much it is painful then he will never like to see any other human facing the same pain.<br><br>
We shall wait and see the end of investigations before jumping to judgments. <br></p>
<p><br><strong><font color=#ff0000 size=4>CNN and some USA media display a film showing some Palestinians as CNN claims celebrating the attack on America. This was a FALSE news and deliberate propaganda act for the following reasons.<br></font></strong><br>
·	The same film was shown in the same channel one day earlier as a celebrations of stopping the Israeli army from re-occupying town of Jenien.<br><br>
·	CNN apologized and publicly announced that they made a mistake.<br><br>
·	Number of news published confirming from officials in Palestinian National Authorities that it is a celebrations of stopping the Israeli army from re-occupying town of Jenien not as CNN claims.<br><br>
Please read this… <a href="articl25.htm">Celebration attacks, AFP</a><br></p>
<p><br><strong>We are confirming the following facts..<br></strong><br>
·	Palestinian nation has severed for years from the Israeli occupation and will never be happy for the severing on any other nation.<br><br>
·	We disagree and reject the USA political positions regarding the Middle East conflict but we have nothing against the American civilians.<br><br>
·	We are against the blind support of the USA government to Israeli and the protection they offer Israel for free.<br><br>
·	What USA government calls violence we consider a legitimate right to fight back the illegal military occupation of our lands since 1967.<br><br>
·	They call killing of Jewish settlers terrorism, and we have daily Palestinians killed by the Israeli army and no one say anything about them.<br><br>
·	All the people on this Earth enjoying their freedom and human rights and we are not allowed to claim any freedom and or any of our legitimate human rights.<br><br>
·	We consider the USA Government a partner with Israel in the continued occupation to the Palestinian lands.<br><br>
·	We are trying to push the USA to be fair with us by educating their people and demanding their support and their action against their government policies.<br><br>
·	We know that terrorism will remove the support (if any) from the American people toward our fair and just case, therefore we will never take that option.<br><br>
·	Americans shall ask their government, why they give their tax paid money to Israel to maintain their occupation power and security and on the other hand they fail to protect Americans in their homelands.<br><br>
·	We encourage all American to look for the other side of the story and not just listen to Zionist controlled media.<br><br>
·   The Zionist / Jewish Money and Media have the most powerfull influence on the government of the USA.<br><br>
·	USA leaders talks about Human Rights and they allow Israel to crack it on daily basis using American missiles, tanks and fighters. <br><br>
·	We as Palestinian lost a lot of family members using USA free arms to Israel, in return USA is accusing us being the killers not the victims.<br><br>
·	We pray to Allah that things may be clear to the American public and they free themselves from the Zionist Media control.<br><br><br><font color=#003399><strong><font size=5>One last question
