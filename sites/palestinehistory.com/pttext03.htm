<p>The British government
therefore issued the Balfour
Declaration on November 2,
1917, in the form of a letter
to a British Zionist leader
from the foreign secretary
Arthur J. Balfour "His Majesty's Government view with favour the
establishment in Palestine of a national home for
the Jewish people, and will use their best
endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this
object, it being clearly understood that nothing
shall be done which may prejudice the civil and
religious rights of the existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine, or the rights and
political status enjoyed by Jews in any other
country."</p>
