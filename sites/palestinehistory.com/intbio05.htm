<p>Two framework accords agreed 1978 and officially signed March 1979 by
Israeli prime minister Begin and Egyptian president Sadat at Camp David,
Maryland, USA, under the guidance of US president Carter. They cover an
Egypt-Israel peace treaty and phased withdrawal of Israel from Sinai, which
was completed 1982, and an overall Middle East settlement including the
election by the West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians of a ‘self-governing
authority’. The latter issue has stalled repeatedly over questions of who
should represent the Palestinians and what form the self-governing body
should take.</p><br><br>
