<p>In July 1, Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), returned to
Palestine for the first time in 33 years. Israel's
control of Palestine had prevented his visiting
the region because he was a sworn enemy of
Israel and, in turn, was regarded by Israelis as
a terrorist. The agreement between Israel and the
PLO, signed in September 1993, had made possible
Arafat's return. He went first to Gaza City in the
Gaza Strip , he was welcomed by a crowd estimated
at 200,000. Three days later he flew by helicopter
to the city of Jericho.Both areas had been granted
Palestinian rule by the treaty. </p>
