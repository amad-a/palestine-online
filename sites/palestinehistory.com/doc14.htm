ARTICLE 3 : INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY<br><br>
The international boundary between Israel and Jordan is
delimited with reference to the boundary definition under the
Mandate as is shown in Annex I (a), on the mapping materials
attached thereto and co-ordinates specified therein.<br><br>
The boundary, as set out in Annex I (a), is the permanent,
secure and recognised international boundary between Israel and
Jordan, without prejudice to the status of any territories that

The parties recognise the international boundary, as well as
each other's territory, territorial waters and airspace, as

the security of the region, take upon themselves to base their
security relations on mutual trust, advancement of joint
interests and co- operation, and to aim towards a regional
framework of partnership in peace.<br><br>
Towards that goal the Parties recognise the achievements of the
European Community and European Union in the development of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and
commit themselves to the creation, in the Middle East, of a
CSCME (Conference on Security and Co-operation in the Middle
East). This commitment entails the adoption of regional models
of security successfully implemented in the post World War era
(along the lines of the Helsinki process) culminating in a
regional zone of security and stability.<br><br>
The obligations referred to in this Article are without
prejudice to the inherent right of self-defence in accordance
with the United Nations Charter.<br><br>
The Parties undertake, in accordance with the provisions of

to refrain from organising, instigating, inciting, assisting or
participating in acts or threats of belligerency, hostility,
subversion or violence against the other Party;<br><br>

threats of belligerency, hostility, subversion or violence
against the other Party do not originate from, and are not
committed within, through or over their territory (hereinafter
the term "territory" includes the airspace and territorial
waters).<br><br>
Consistent with the era of peace and with the efforts to build
regional security and to avoid and prevent aggression and
violence, the Parties further agree to refrain from the
following:<br><br>
joining or in any way assisting, promoting or co-operating with
any coalition, organisation or alliance with a military or
security character with a third party, the objectives or
activities of which include launching aggression or other acts
of military hostility against the other Party, in contravention
of the provisions of the present Treaty.<br><br>
allowing the entry, stationing and operating on their
territory, or through it, of military forces, personnel or
materiel of a third party, in circumstances which may adversely
prejudice the security of the other Party.<br><br>
Both Parties will take necessary and effective measures, and
will co-operate in combating terrorism of all kinds. The
Parties undertake:<br><br>
to take necessary and effective measures to prevent acts of
terrorism, subversion or violence from being carried out from
their territory or through it and to take necessary and
effective measures to combat such activities and all their
perpetrators.<br><br>
without prejudice to the basic rights of freedom of expression
and association, to take necessary and effective measures to

of any group or organisation, and their infrastructure, which

incitement to the use of, violent means.<br><br>
to co-operate in preventing and combating cross-boundary
infiltrations.<br><br>
Any question as to the implementation of this Article will be
dealt with through a mechanism of consultations which will
include a liaison system, verification, supervision, and where
necessary, other mechanisms, and higher level consultation. The
details of the mechanism of consultations will be contained in
an agreement to be concluded by the Parties within 3 months of
the exchange of the instruments of ratification of this Treaty.<br><br>
The Parties undertake to work as a matter of priority, and as
soon as possible in the context of the Multilateral Working
Group on Arms Control and Regional Security, and jointly,
towards the following:<br><br>
the creation in the Middle East of a region free from hostile
alliances and coalitions;<br><br>
the creation of a Middle East free from weapons of mass
destruction, both conventional and non- conventional, in the
context of a comprehensive, lasting and stable peace,
characterised by the renunciation of the use of force,
reconciliation and goodwill.<br><br>
ARTICLE 5 : DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER BILATERAL RELATIONS<br><br>
The Parties agree to establish full diplomatic and consular
relations and to exchange resident ambassadors within one month

allocations of both of them in Jordan River and Yarmouk River
waters and Araba/Arava ground water in accordance with the
agreed acceptable principles, quantities and quality as set out
in Annex II , which shall be fully respected and complied with.<br><br>
The Parties, recognising the necessity to find a practical,
just and agreed solution to their water problems and with the
view that the subject of water can form the basis for the
advancement of co- operation between them, jointly undertake to
ensure that the management and development of their water
resources do not, in any way, harm the water resources of the
other Party.<br><br>
The Parties recognise that their water resources are not
sufficient to meet their needs. More water should be supplied
for their use through various methods, including projects of
regional and international co-operation.<br><br>
In light of paragraph 3 of this Article, with the understanding
that co-operation in water-related subjects would be to the
benefit of both Parties, and will help alleviate their water
shortages, and that water issues along their entire boundary
must be dealt with in their totality, including the possibility
of trans-boundary water transfers, the Parties agree to search
for ways to alleviate water shortage and to co- operate in the
following fields:<br><br>
development of existing and new water resources, increasing the
water availability including co- operation on a regional basis
as appropriate, and minimising wastage of water resources
through the chain of their uses;<br><br>
prevention of contamination of water resources;<br><br>
mutual assistance in the alleviation of water shortages;<br><br>
transfer of information and joint research and development in
water-related subjects, and review of the potentials for
enhancement of water resources development and use.<br><br>
The implementation of both Parties' undertakings under this
Article is detailed in Annex II.<br><br>
ARTICLE 7 : ECONOMIC RELATIONS<br><br>
Viewing economic development and prosperity as pillars of
peace, security and harmonious relations between states,
peoples and individual human beings, the Parties, taking note
of understandings reached between them, affirm their mutual
desire to promote economic co-operation between them, as well
as within the framework of wider regional economic
co-operation.<br><br>
In order to accomplish this goal, the Parties agree to the
following:<br><br>
to remove all discriminatory barriers to normal economic
relations, to terminate economic boycotts directed at each
other, and to co-operate in terminating boycotts against either
Party by third parties;<br><br>

goods and services should guide their relations, the Parties
will enter into negotiations with a view to concluding
agreements on economic co- operation, including trade and the
establishment of a free trade area, investment, banking,
industrial co- operation and labour, for the purpose of
promoting beneficial economic relations, based on principles to
be agreed upon, as well as on human development considerations

their neighbourly economic relations with other regional
parties.<br><br>

by the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the contribution
made by them towards the alleviation of human suffering, the
Parties will seek to further alleviate those problems arising
on a bilateral level.<br><br>

conflict in the Middle East cannot be fully resolved on the
bilateral level, the Parties will seek to resolve them in
appropriate forums, in accordance with international law,
