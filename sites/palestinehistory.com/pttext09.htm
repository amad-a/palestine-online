<p>The British government published a new White Paper
restricting Jewish immigration and offering
independence for Palestine within ten years. This
was rejected by the Zionists, who then organized
terrorist groups and launched a bloody campaign
against the British and the Palestinians. The aim
was to drive them both out of Palestine and to
pave the way for the establishment of the Zionist
state.</p>
