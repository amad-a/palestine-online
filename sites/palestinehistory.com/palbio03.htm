<p>(PFLP), Arabic AL-JABHA AL-SHA'BIYAH LI-TAHRIR FILAsTIN , It was
established in 1967 in an amalgamation of three different Palestinian
guerrilla groups by Georges Habash . The PFLP suffered from conflicts
between its several factions, though all were engaged in guerrilla
activities. The PFLP rejected political compromise with Israel and was
pledged to the elimination of that state. It took a vigorously anti-western
and anti capitalist stance on other Middle Eastern questions.<br><br>
The PFLP carried out or organized many notorious guerrilla actions against
Israel, most notably the hijacking and destruction of airliners to Israel
in the late 1960s and '70s.<br></p><br>
