<p>Palestinian child center in Ramallah<br><br>
Israeli soldiers are deliberately targeting Palestinian children, aiming to
kill, maim and disable as many of them as possible, according to a report
by a Palestinian child center in Ramallah on the West Bank.
<br><br>
Director of the Palestinian Happy Child Center, Dr. Jumama Audeh, said the
high rate of casualty among children leaves no doubt as to what the
occupation army is up to.
<br><br>
"They want to kill, maim, paralyze and disable an entire generation," she
said in a report published Monday.
<br><br>
Audeh pointed out that over 25 Palestinian children were killed and over
500 other children were wounded in the ongoing Palestinian uprising.
<br><br>
Audeh said that the overall percentage of wounds to the upper parts of the
body (heart and head) was initially 50,2%, and has gone up to 83.2 % in the
later period. The use of live ammunition, she said rose from 20,2% to
57,7%, and now to 82%.
<br><br>
The report furnished the additional following additional figures: 44% of
casualties are now injured in the chest and 43% in the head (for a combined
total of 87%). Moreover, 18% of all wounded are in a state of clinical
death, critically wounded, paraplegic or quadriplegic.
<br><br>
Furthermore, 20% of all the wounded are likely to remain saddled with a
permanent disability; the average age of all martyrs or wounded persons is
21 years.</p><br>
