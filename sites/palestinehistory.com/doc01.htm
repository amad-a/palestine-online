June 27, 1989<br><br>
1989 Summit of the EU regarding the Middle East<br><br>
The European Council has examined the situation in the Middle
East conflict in the light of recent events and contacts
undertaken over several months by the Presidency and the Troika
with the parties concerned, and it has drawn the following
conclusions:<br><br>
1. The policy of the Twelve on the Middle East conflict is
defined in the Venice Declaration of 13 June 1980 and other
subsequent declarations. It consists in upholding the right to
security of all states in the region, including Israel, that is
to say, to live within secure, recognized and guaranteed
frontiers, and in upholding justice for all the peoples of the
region, which includes recognition of the legitimate rights of
the Palestinian people, including their right to
self-determination with all that this implies.<br><br>
The Twelve consider that these objectives should be achieved by
peaceful means in the framework of an international peace
conference under the auspices of the United Nations, as the
appropriate forum for the direct negotiations between the
parties concerned, with a view to a comprehensive, just and
lasting settlement.<br><br>
The European Council is also of the view that the PLO should
participate in this process. It expresses its support for every
effort by the permanent members of the Security Council of the
United Nations to bring the parties closer together, create a
climate of confidence between them, and facilitate in this way
the convening of the international conference.<br><br>
2. The community and its Member States have demonstrated their
readiness to participate actively in the search for a
negotiated solution to the conflict and to cooperate fully in
the social and economic development of the peoples of the
region.<br><br>
The European Council expresses its satisfaction regarding the
policy of contacts with all parties undertaken by the
Presidency and the Troika, and has decided to purse it.<br><br>
3. The European Council welcomes the support given by the
Extraordinary Summit Meeting of the Arab League, held in
Casablanca, to the decisions of the Palestinian National
Council in Algiers, involving acceptance of Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338, which resulted in the recognition of
Israel's right to exist, as well as the renunciation of
terrorism.<br><br>
It also welcomes the efforts undertaken by the United States in
their contracts with the parties directly concerned and
particularly the dialogue entered into with the PLO<br><br>
Advantage should be taken of these favorable circumstances to
engender a spirit of tolerance and peace with a view to
entering resolutely on the path of negotiations..<br><br>
4. The European Council deplores the continuing deterioration
of the situation in the Occupied Territories and the constant
increase in the number of dead and wounded, and the suffering
of the population.<br><br>
It appeals urgently to the Israeli authorities to put an end to
repressive measures, to implement Resolutions 605, 607, and 608
of the Security Council and to respect the provisions of the
Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Populations in
Times of War.<br><br>
They appeal in particular for the reopening educational
facilities in the West Bank.<br><br>
5. On the basis of the positions of principle of the Twelve,
the European Council welcomes the proposal for elections in the
Occupied Territories as a contribution to the peace process,
provided that:<br><br>
The elections are set in the context of a process towards a
comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement of the conflict.
the elections take place in the Occupied Territories, including
East Jerusalem, under adequate guarantees of freedom. no
solution is excluded and the final negotiation takes place on
the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 of the Security Council of
the United Nations, based on the principle of "land for peace".<br><br>
6. the European Council launches a solemn appeal to the parties
concerned to seize the opportunity to achieve peace. Respect by
each of the parties for the legitimate rights of the other
should facilitate the normalizing of relations between all the
countries of the region.<br><br>
The European Council calls upon the Arab countries to establish
normal relations of peace and cooperation with Israel and asks
that country in turn to recognize the right of the Palestinian
people to exercise self-determination.
