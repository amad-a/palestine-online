The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people.
Here their spiritual, religious and national identity was
formed. Here they achieved independence and created a culture
of national and universal significance. Here they wrote and
gave the Bible to the world.<br><br>
Exiled from the Land of Israel, the Jewish people remained
faithful to it in all the countries of their dispersion, never
ceasing to pray and hope for their return and the restoration
of their national freedom.<br><br>
Impelled by this hiostoric association Jews strove throughout
the centuries to go back to the land of their fathers and
regain their statehood. In recent decades they returned in
their masses. They reclaimed the wilderness, rvived their
language, built cities and villages, and established a vigorous
and ever-growing community, with its own economic and cultural
life. They sought peace yet were prepared to defend themselves.
They brought the blessings of progress to all inhabitants of
the country and looked forward to sovereign independence.<br><br>
In the year 1897 the First Zionist Congress, inspired by
Theodor Herzl's vision of the Jewish State, proclaimed the
right of the Jewish people to national revival in their own
country. This right was acknowledged by the Balfour Declaration
of November 2, 1917, and re-affirmed by the mandate of the
League of Nations, which gave explicit international
recognition to the historic connection of the Jewish people
with Palestine and their right to reconstitute their National
Home.<br><br>
The recent holocaust, which engulfed millions of Jews in
Europe, proved anew the need to solve the problem of the
homelessness and lack of independence of the Jewish people by
means of the re-establishment of the Jewish State, which would
open the gates to all Jews and endow the Jewish people with
equality of status among tyhe family of nations.<br><br>
The survivors of the disastrius slaughter in Europe, and also
Jews from other lands, have not desisted from efforts to reach
Eretz Israel, in face of difficulties, obstacles and perils;
and have not ceased to urge their right to a life of dignity,
freedom and honest toil in their ancestral land.<br><br>
In the Second World War the Jewish people in Palestine made
their full contribution to the struggle of the freedom-loving
nations against the Nazi evil. The sacrifices of their soldiers
and their war effort gained them the right to rank with the
nations which founded the United Nations. On November 29, 1947,
the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Resolution
requiring the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The
General Assembly caloled upon the inhabitants of the country to
take all the necessary steps on their part to put the plan into
effect. This recognition by the United Nations of the right of
the Jewish people to establish their independent State is
unassailable.<br><br>
It is the natural right of the Jewish peole to lead, as do all
other nations, an independent existence in its sovereign State.<br><br>
ACCORDINGLY WE, the members of the National Council,
representing the Jewish people in Palestine, and the World
Zionist Movement, are met together in solemn assembly today,
the day of termination of the British mandate for Palestine;
and by virtue of the natural and historic right of the Jewish
people and of the Resolution of the General Assembly of the
United Nations.<br><br>
WE HEREBY PROCLAIM the establishment of the Jewish State in
Palestine to be called 'Medinal Israel' (The State of Israel).
WE HEREBY DECLARE that, as from the termination of the British
Mandate at midnight, the 14th-15th May, 1948, and pending the
setting up of the duly elected bodies of the State in
accordance with a Constitution, to be drwan up by the
Constituent Assembly not later than the 1st October, 1948, the
National Council shall act as the Provisional State Council,
and that the National Administration shall constitute the
Provisional Government of the Jewish State, which shall be
known as Israel.<br><br>
THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be open for immigration of Jews from
all countries of their dispersion; will promote the development
of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; will be
based on the principles of liberty, justice and peace as
conceived by the Prophets of Israel, will uphold the full
social and political equality of all its citizens, without
distinction of religion, race or sex;will guarantee freedom of
religion, conscience, education and culture; will safeguard the
Holy Places of all religions; and will loyally uphold the
principles of the United Nations Charter.<br><br>
THE STATE OF ISRAEL will be ready to cooperate with the organs
and representatives of the United Nations in the implementation
of the Resolution of the Assembly of November, 29, 1947, and
will take steps to bring about Economic Union over the whole of
Palestine. We appeal to the United Nations to assist the Jewish
people in the building of its State and to admit Israel into
the family of Nations. In the midst of wanton aggression, we
yet call upon the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to
preserve the ways of peace and play their part in the
development of the State, on the basis of full and equal
citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and
institutions - provisional and permanent.<br><br>
We extend our hand in peace and neighbourliness to all the
neighbouring states and their peoples, and invite them to
co-operate with the independent Jewish nation for the common
good of all. The State of Israel is prepared to make its
contribution to the progress of the Middle East as a whole.<br><br>
Our call goes out to the Jewish people all over the world to
rally to our side in the task of immigration and development
and to stand by us in the great struggle for the fulfilment of
the dream of generations for the redemption of Israel.<br><br>
With trust in Almighty God, we set our hand to this
Declaration, at this Session of the Provisional State Council,
on this Sabbath eve, the fifth of Iyar, 5708, the fourteenth
day of May, 1948.<br><br>
