<p>Resolution adopted unanimously in December 1948 by the United Nations
General Assembly. The objective of the 30-article declaration is to promote
and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The
declaration proclaims the personal, civil, political, economic, social, and
cultural rights of humans, which are limited only by recognition for the
rights and freedoms of others and the requirements of morality, public
order, and general welfare. Among the rights cited by the declaration are
the rights to life, liberty, and security of person; to freedom from
arbitrary arrest; to a fair trial; to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty; to freedom from interference with the privacy of one's home and
correspondence; to freedom of movement and residence; to asylum,
nationality, and ownership of property; to freedom of thought, conscience,
religion, opinion, and expression; to association, peaceful assembly, and
participation in government; to social security,<br><br>
The General Assembly in 1955 authorized two human rights covenants, one
relating to civil and political rights, and the other to economic, social,
and cultural rights. After a long struggle for ratification, both of these
covenants became effective in January 1976.</p><br><br>
