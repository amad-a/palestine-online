<p>By MICHAEL LERNER<br><br>
My son served in the Israeli army in the West Bank, so for me the barbarous
killings Thursday of three soldiers by a lynch mob in Ramallah made me feel
the same anger that must have led Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to bomb
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's compound in retaliation and to escalate
the war against the Palestinians. Yet I can also understand that to the
Palestinians the three boys killed were just members of the occupying army,
the army that has brutally killed more than 85 Palestinians and wounded
more than 2,000 civilians in the past two weeks and which might have seemed
indistinguishable from the Jewish mobs that attacked random Arab Israelis
in Nazareth a few days ago, beating and burning.
<br><br>
For every outrage on one side, there is a story of outrage on the other.
And yet, in my synagogue on Yom Kippur we atoned for our side of the story
for Jewish violence. Our atonement was not an attempt to claim that Israel
holds all the responsibility. I believe that Palestinians ought to adopt a
nonviolent pose and reject any leader who advocates violence, because I
believe that violence is always wrong no matter how noble the purpose and
because in the context of the current struggle, it had the predicted effect
of destroying rather than enhancing the chances for peace an outcome
sought by extremists on both sides.
<br><br>
Palestinian violence is both immoral and irrational. Yet the preponderance
of responsibility lies with Israel and with an international media that
continue to obscure the basic realities facing the Palestinian people, and
continue to treat the death of Israeli soldiers enforcing a brutal
occupation as somehow more outrageous and barbarous than the killing of
many times as many Palestinian teenagers who were resisting the occupation.
<br><br>
To me, Israeli deaths are a personal tragedy. But have we not yet learned
that in God's eyes every human being is equally treasured? The way we talk
that discounts the huge number of Palestinians killed and wounded
reinforces the desperation that led to the current tragic moment. But, you
might ask, didn't Arafat irrationally reject a wonderful peace accord being
offered him by Barak? Isn't this current outbreak just more of the same
irrational hatred that always leads Palestinians to reject a generous peace
being offered by Israel?
<br><br>
The reality is quite different. Since taking office, Barak has expanded
existing settlements, built new roads into the West Bank and made it clear
at Camp David that he would insist on keeping the vast majority of settlers
in place. The state the Palestinians would then be offered would have
within it a group of Israeli nationalistic fanatics, many of whom moved to
the West Bank precisely to ensure that there would never be a Palestinian
state.
<br><br>
The resulting scenario is obvious: The settlers would continue their long
history of violent attacks against Palestinians, and when the Palestinian
state tried to impose law and order, the settlers would demand protection
from the Israeli army, which would use the new roads to send in tanks and
heavy artillery just as it has done in the past week.
<br><br>
These Israeli roads and settlements turn the claim of offering the
Palestinians 90% of the land into a cruel hoax. With the Israeli military
patrolling those roads that crisscross the Palestinian state, Palestinians
would face humiliating searches and would not be able to move freely.
Imagine someone offering you a house in which you were going to have large
rooms but they were in charge of the hallways between the rooms. You would
quickly realize that your freedom to be "at home" was remarkably
compromised. For a people who have endured 33 years of military occupation,
with a long history of documented torture, house demolitions and
harassment, this doesn't sound like such a great deal.
<br><br>
Nor are Palestinian demands for control over the Temple Mount and the
adjacent sections of East Jerusalem irrational. Muslims from the occupied
territories have frequently been prevented from coming to the Temple Mount
when Israel proclaims "security closings" of the border. Israelis who were
rightly outraged at being denied access to the Western Wall when Jerusalem
was under Jordanian (not Palestinian) rule from 1948 to 1967 have
effectively imposed similar conditions on the 1 million Muslims in Gaza.
<br><br>
At the same time, many religious authorities ban Jews from walking on the
Temple Mount until the messiah comes. So ceding sovereignty there would not
have been a religious hardship. Barak could have conceded interim
sovereignty to the Palestinians on the condition that those arrangements
would be reopened when the messiah arrived (by Biblical criteria: nations
beating their swords into plowshares and the lion lying down with the
lamb).
<br><br>
Nor has Israel ever acknowledged responsibility for the hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians who were driven out of Israel in 1948, many of
whose descendants today live in refugee camps.
<br><br>
None of this had been resolved at Camp David, and so most Palestinians
realized that the peace process was just another mechanism to prolong the
status quo of an oppressive occupation.
<br><br>
I was honored to attend the signing of the Oslo accords at the White House
in 1993, and in the pages of Tikkun magazine I have severely criticized
those Palestinian intellectuals like Edward Said who did not believe that
Palestinian self-determination would be granted in the five years that Oslo
promised. Now, seven years after Oslo, I can understand why Palestinians
would feel cheated and outraged over the endless occupation. Add to that
the racist attitudes that led Barak to seek Israeli Arab votes in the last
election, his subsequent refusal to allow Arab parties into his government
for fear that their presence would make the government appear
"illegitimate" and the long history of discrimination against Israeli Arabs
in housing and employment, and you get the volatile ingredients that led to
the explosions last week and the subsequent massive violence against Arabs
both inside Israel and in the occupied territories.
<br><br>
None of this justifies Palestinian violence or the far more massive
counter-violence of the occupying Israeli army. But I see no hope that the
disgusting cycle of violence on both sides will stop until Israel is
willing to end the occupation and end its internal racism against Arab
Israelis.
<br><br>
As a religious Jew, I know that God and the Torah are served best when we
insist that every human being, including our enemies, be seen as equally
valuable to God and equally created as embodiments of the divine. Given my
own outrage over the killing of Israeli soldiers, this is a moment when it
seems easier to just forget my faith and stay in my anger. But I also know
that when the Jewish people can only see our own pain, however real and
legitimate,it is time to atone.
