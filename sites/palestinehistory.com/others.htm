Balfour, Arthur James, 1st Earl of Balfour (1848-1930)
------------------------------------------------------

British   Conservative  politician,  prime  minister  1902-05  and  foreign
secretary  1916-19,  when  he  issued  the Balfour Declaration 1917 and was
involved  in  peace  negotiations  after World War I, signing the Treaty of
Versailles.

Son  of  a Scottish landowner, Balfour was elected a Conservative member of
Parliament  1874. In Lord Salisbury’s ministry he was secretary for Ireland
1887,  and  for  his  ruthless  vigour was called ‘Bloody Balfour’ by Irish
nationalists.  In  1891  and  again  in  1895  he  became First Lord of the
Treasury  and  leader of the Commons, and in 1902 he succeeded Salisbury as
prime   minister.   His  cabinet  was  divided  over  Joseph  Chamberlain’s
tariff-reform  proposals,  and  in  the  1905 elections suffered a crushing
defeat.

Balfour  retired  from  the  party  leadership  1911. In 1915 he joined the
Asquith  coalition  as  First  Lord  of the Admiralty. As foreign secretary
1916-19  he  issued the Balfour Declaration in favour of a national home in
Palestine  for  the  Jews. He was Lord President of the Council 1919-22 and
1925-29.  Created  1st  Earl  of  Balfour  1922.  He  also  wrote  books on
philosophy.</p></pre>

-------------------

Letter,  dated  2  Nov  1917, from British foreign secretary A J Balfour to
Lord Rothschild (chair, British Zionist Federation) stating: ‘HM government
view  with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the
Jewish people.’ It helped form the basis for the foundation of Israel 1948.</p></pre>

Abdel Nasser, Gamal (1918-1970)
-------------------------------

Egyptian  politician,  prime  minister  1954-56  and from 1956 president of
Egypt  (the  United Arab Republic 1958-71). His nationalization of the Suez
Canal  1956  led  to  an Anglo-French invasion and the Suez Crisis, and his
ambitions  for  an Egyptian-led union of Arab states led to disquiet in the
Middle  East  (and  in  the West). Nasser was also an early and influential
leader of the nonaligned movement.

Nasser entered the army from Cairo Military Academy, and was wounded in the
Palestine War of 1948-49.</p></pre>

Sadat, Anwar (1918-1981)
------------------------

Egyptian  politician.  Succeeding  Nasser  as  president  1970, he restored
morale  by  his  handling  of the Egyptian campaign in the 1973 war against
Israel.  In  1974  his  plan  for economic, social, and political reform to
transform Egypt was unanimously adopted in a referendum. In 1977 he visited
Israel  to  reconcile  the  two countries, and shared the Nobel Peace Prize
with  Israeli  prime  minister  Menachem Begin 1978. He was assassinated by
Islamic group.</p></pre>

Camp David Agreements
---------------------

Two  framework  accords  agreed  1978  and  officially signed March 1979 by
Israeli  prime  minister  Begin and Egyptian president Sadat at Camp David,
Maryland,  USA,  under  the  guidance of US president Carter. They cover an
Egypt-Israel peace treaty and phased withdrawal of Israel from Sinai, which
was  completed  1982,  and  an overall Middle East settlement including the
election  by the West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians of a ‘self-governing
authority’.  The  latter issue has stalled repeatedly over questions of who
should  represent  the  Palestinians  and what form the self-governing body
should take.</p></pre>

Mubarak, Hosni (1928-)
----------------------

Egyptian  politician,  president  from  1981. Vice president to Anwar Sadat
from  1975, Mubarak succeeded him on his assassination. He has continued to
pursue  Sadat's  moderate  policies,  and  has  significantly increased the
freedom  of the press and of political association, while trying to repress
the  growing Islamic movement. He was re-elected 1987 and 1993. He survived
an assassination attempt 1995.

Mubarak commanded the air force 1972–75 and was responsible for the initial
victories  in  the Egyptian campaign of 1973 against Israel. He led Egypt's
opposition  to  Iraq's  1990  invasion of Kuwait and played an instrumental
role in arranging the Middle East peace conference Nov 1991.</p></pre>

Carter, Jimmy (James Earl) (1924-)
----------------------------------

39th  president of the USA 1977-81, a Democrat. In 1976 he narrowly wrested
the presidency from Gerald Ford. Features of his presidency were the return
of  the Panama Canal Zone to Panama, the Camp David Agreements for peace in
the  Middle  East,  and  the Iranian seizure of US embassy hostages. He was
defeated  by  Ronald  Reagan 1980. During the 1990s he emerged as a leading
mediator and peace negotiator, securing President Aristide's safe return to
Haiti Oct 1994.

Born  in  Plains,  Georgia,  Carter served in the navy as a physicist until
1953,  when  he  took  over  the  family  peanut business. He first entered
politics  1962  when he made a successful bid for the Georgia State Senate,
and  in  1970  was  elected governor. In 1976, after a long and hard-fought
campaign,  he  won  the  Democratic  presidential nomination and went on to
secure  a  narrow  victory  over  Gerald  Ford, becoming the first Southern
president since the American Civil War.</p></pre>

Clinton, Bill (William Jefferson) (1946-)
-----------------------------------------

42nd  president  of the USA from 1993, a Democrat. He served as governor of
Arkansas  1979-81  and  1983-93,  establishing  a  liberal  and progressive
reputation.  As president, he sought to implement a New Democrat programme,
combining  social  reform with economic conservatism as a means of bringing
the  country  out  of recession. He was initially successful in introducing
legislation  to  reduce  the federal deficit and cut crime, but the loss of
both  houses  of  Congress to the Republicans in the 1994 midterm elections
presented a serious obstacle to further social reform.

Born  in  the  railway  town  of  Hope,  Arkansas,  Clinton  graduated from
Georgetown  University  1968, won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University
1968-70, and graduated from Yale University Law School 1973. He was elected
attorney  general  for  Arkansas in 1975. With running mate Al Gore, he won
the  1992  presidential  campaign  by  focusing  on domestic issues and the
ailing  economy.  He  became  the  first Democrat in the White House for 13
years.

During  his  first  year  in office Clinton secured passage of an ambitious
deficit reduction plan, combining spending cuts with tax increases targeted
against  the  rich  ,  and  won Congressional approval of the controversial
North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) and wide-ranging anti crime
bills. His alleged involvement in irregular financial dealings in the 1980s
(the Whitewater affair) thereafter clouded his presidency and in the autumn
of  1994  his  much-championed health-care reform proposals were blocked by
Congress.  A  subsequent  diplomatic success in Haiti and the return of its
democratically  elected  president Aristide failed to prevent a devastating
defeat for his party in the Nov 1994 midterm elections.</p></pre>

-------------------------

US  secretary  of  state (1973-6) and academic. His family emigrated to the
USA in 1938 , Jew . He studied at Harvard, and after war service worked for
a  number  of public agencies before joining the Harvard faculty (1962-71).

was  the  main  American  figure in the negotiations to end the Vietnam War
(for which he shared the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize), and as secretary of state
served  under Nixon and Ford. His 'shuttle diplomacy' was aimed at bringing
about  peace  between Israel and the Arab states, and resulted in a notable
improvement  in  Israeli-Egyptian  relations.  After  leaving public office
(1977),  he  became  professor  of diplomacy at Georgetown, and established
Kissinger  Associates,  a consulting firm. His book Diplomacy was published
in 1994.</p></pre>

United  Nations Relief and Works Agency
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)
-----------------------------------------------

United  Nations  Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East  (UNRWA),  agency  of  the  United Nations, established by the General
Assembly  in  December  1949  to  provide  relief  and  welfare services to
refugees  from  Palestine  and their descendants, living both in and out of
refugee  camps. The refugees, who lost their homes and their livelihoods as
a  result  of  the  Arab-Israeli  conflict in 1948, constitute a continuing
problem between Israel and the Arab nations.

At  present  more than 2.6 million Palestinian refugees are registered with
the  agency.  Only  a  small number of them receive direct aid, such as the
distribution  of  food.  UNRWA's main functions in the 1980s and 1990s have
been  to  provide  health care at the clinics and health centers run by the
agency and educational services at UNRWA schools.

The  agency  is  under  the  direction  of  a  commissioner  general  and a
10-member-nation  advisory  commission. It maintains headquarters in Vienna
and Amman, Jordan.</p></pre>

Universal Declaration of Human Rights
-------------------------------------

Resolution  adopted  unanimously  in  December  1948  by the United Nations
General Assembly. The objective of the 30-article declaration is to promote
and  encourage  respect  for  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms. The
declaration proclaims the personal, civil, political, economic, social, and
cultural  rights  of  humans, which are limited only by recognition for the
rights  and  freedoms  of  others  and the requirements of morality, public
order,  and  general welfare. Among the rights cited by the declaration are
the  rights  to  life,  liberty,  and  security  of person; to freedom from
arbitrary  arrest;  to  a  fair trial; to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty;  to  freedom  from  interference with the privacy of one's home and
correspondence;   to   freedom   of  movement  and  residence;  to  asylum,
nationality,  and ownership of property; to freedom of thought, conscience,
religion,  opinion,  and expression; to association, peaceful assembly, and
participation in government; to social security,

The  General  Assembly  in  1955 authorized two human rights covenants, one
relating  to civil and political rights, and the other to economic, social,
and  cultural rights. After a long struggle for ratification, both of these
covenants became effective in January 1976.</p></pre>
