<p>In Jan.23 , Nineteen Israelis died and more than
60 others were wounded when two martyr bombs
exploded at a crowded bus stop near Netanya, north
of Tel Aviv. Most of the dead and wounded were
soldiers. The militant group Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility for the attack, the sixth such
incident since April 1994. During that time,
Islamic guerrillas killed 54 people and wounded
nearly 200 in their efforts to derail the fragile
peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman denounced the
bombings and called for a halt in talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, though Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his cabinet decided to
continue negotiations for a peace settlement.</p>
