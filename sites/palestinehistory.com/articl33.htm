<div align="center"><font size="+3" color="blue"> MUTUAL RESPECT </font></div><br>
<p>By : Inna Stetsenko<br><br>
I would like to express first my deep compassion to all Palestinian people
for everything that made them suffer for so long time.
<br><br>
I do not know a lot about Israelis/Palestinian conflict, but definitely it
is complex and cannot be easily solved. And it cannot be solved on political
level only. The worst thing is that people on both sides developed profound
mistrust and hatred toward one another and cannot see each other as equal
human beings, cannot feel compassion and respect to the people on the other
side. Without eliminating such sentiments just and long-lasting peace will
never be possible to achieve whatever political solutions will be reached.
<br><br>
You, probably, disagree, but I would put MUTUAL RESPECT as a first thing
needed, peace will follow. As far as people see each other's civilians as
legitimate anonymous targets, as far as they think they can collectively
punish each other this logic goes back and forth, constituting a closed
circle, promoting endless rounds of violence. To get out of this desperately
evil circle it is very important to give ordinary people from both sides a
chance to know each other, to discuss their fears and hopes, to share their
stories and to make friends.
<br><br>
I have seen in Internet that there are some attempts to do that, but
definitely what is done is far from what is needed. Keeping people divided,
making barriers between them is surely part of the politics that does not
want fair and long peace. And it is actually how it is - Palestinians are
restricted from going to Israel, Israelis would be afraid of going to
Palestinian territories, as they are becoming targets. But, as it seems to
me, it is possible to arrange at least pen pal service - probably, not
through Internet, as not many people have access to computers, but through
regular mail, it is not extremely difficult to collect addresses and some
sentences from those who want to participate and to distribute them at the
other site. Somebody will definitely answer.
<br><br>
I would also suggest to try to reach people in the USA, in Europe, as they
do not really understand what is going on there. Sure, it will not solve any
problem overnight, but will help to create atmosphere in which it will be
easier to deal with situation in fair manner.
<br><br>
I am from Ukraine, now in the USA. I do not know too much about relationship
between USA and Israel, but what I know for sure is that majority of
Israelis new comers are from Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia and Eastern
Europe, and that one even does not need any other language other than
Russian on the streets in Israel. I know these people, their psychology and
the reasons for their immigration. Definitely, they are not just monsters,
but they are absolutely not educated in the history of the region, so can
easily accept whatever officials are saying to them, and actually they do
not have a choice, as they do not know anybody from the other side. So, I
return to my major point - personal contacts and understanding are the key
things, lack of them undermines any efforts to establish fair peace.
<br><br>
You can place this letter anywhere you think it will be read (on the Web or
real world) and give my address to anybody who might want to talk to me, I
will be glad to share my thoughts.
<br><br>
Hope to hear from you soon.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Inna Stetsenko<br>
