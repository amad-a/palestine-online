<p>Two  Israeli  settlers  were killed and ten others were wounded when a bomb
went off outside a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip.<br><br>
Israeli  helicopter  gunships  attacked for more then three hours a host of
Palestinian civilian and security targets throughout the Gaza Strip, caused
as  many  as  150  casualties  and  inflicted  heavy damage to security and
civilian   buildings  as  well  as  telecommunication  facilities.  Israeli
gunboats  also  joined  the attack, firing missiles and artillery shells at
buildings in Yasser Arafat's headquarters.<br><br>
The  Israeli  occupation authorities are barring the delivery of a medicine
shipment  donated  by  a  number  of  Arab  and  Islamic  countries  to the
Palestinian authority in Gaza.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
The  sky  over  Gaza  city  is illuminated as a rocket fired by the Israeli
helicopter gunship explodes in the city centre of Gaza. Israeli helicopters
fired  missiles  at  targets in Gaza City in response to a bomb attack on a
Jewish  settlers  bus in which two Israelis were killed earlier in the day.
The helicopters fired at least 11 missiles from around 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) in
areas  near  Palestinian  President  Yasser Arafat's seaside office and the
headquarters  of  his  Fatah faction, this aerial assault countined to more
then three hours. (Photo 1)<br><br>

a  wrecked car during clashes with Israeli soldiers on the outskirts of the
West Bank town of Ramallah. (Photo 2)<br><br>
Jewish  settlers  look  at  the  damage  to  an  Israeli  bus peppered with
schrapnel  holes  near  the Kfar Darom Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip,
following  a  bomb explosion in front of the bus. Two Israeli settlers were
killed in the roadside blast and nine injured.<br><br>
