As  per  PA  orders  ,  Palestinian  workers reconstructed and painted
Joseph's  Tomb,  in the West bank city of Nablus. The religious shrine
was  ransacked  last  Saturday  by  Palestinians  just  after  Israeli
soldiers evacuated the site.<br><br>
Jewish  settlers  have  been attacking churches and mosques throughout
the  Jewish state as part of thier campaign against Arabs, Muslims and
Christians  alike. In Yaffa, Jewish saboteurs "Jami Hasan Bek", an old
Mosque  on  fire. Several Arab homes and busienss were also vandalized
by  the saboteurs. Thousands of Jaffa Palestinian residents managed in
putting out the fire. Few days back a Jewish rolled burning tires into
the  "Omari  Mosque"  in  the  town of Tabariya, setting the mosque in
fire.<br><br>
Jewish  settlers  closed  the  Hebron-Jerusalem highway and some other
main  roads in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, settlers continued
to  maraud Arab towns and villages in the West Bank, attacking unarmed
and helpless Palestinian farmers and often setting fire on their olive
fields.  Settlers  have  been  implicated  in  at  least four gruesome
murders of Palestinians in the past few days.<br><br>
Barak  extended his ultimatum to the Palestinian Authority for another
48  hours  to  end  the  Intifadha  or else the peace process would be
declared dead.<br><br>
