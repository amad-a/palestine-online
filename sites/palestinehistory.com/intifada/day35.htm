<p>Heavily  armed  Israeli  occupation soldiers shot five Palestinians dead in

Palestinian  population  centers  throughout  the  West  Bank, causing many
casualties and inflicting heavy damage.<br><br>
The  towns of Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Ayda refugee camp, Tulkarm and Ramallah
were coming under heavy bombardment.<br><br>
The   village  of  al-Khader  was  earlier  subjected  to  heavy  artillery
bombardment  and  helicopter  strafing,  resulting  in scores of casualties
among the civilian population.<br><br>
In clashes before the aerial bombardment , Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and five were injured, one seriously.<br><br>
At  least two Palestinians were killed by machinegun rounds fired by attack
helicopters.  The  two  were identified as Wael Said Ighneim (28 years old)
