<p>On  Saturday, Barak issued an ultimatum to Arafat to stop the Iftifada
within 48 hours.<br><br>
Barak  is  studying a prisoners of war swap where Israel would release
Lebanese  Islamic  leaders,  in  exchange  for  three Israeli soldiers
captured  by  Hizbullah  at  the  Shab’a  farms,  a Lebanese territory
occupied by Israel .<br><br>
Israel  PM Ehud Barak has ordered Gaza International Airport shut down
,  Presedant  Arafat  is  allowed to use the airport , this action has
been  taken  after  an Israeli bus carrying Israeli border and customs
officer came under fire near Rafah Saturday night.<br><br>
The UN Security Council approved a resolution condemning the excessive
use   of   force   and   calling   for   an  immediate  resumption  of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks with a speedy and objective inquiry on
the fighting.<br><br>
Israeli  troops opened fire on school children in Gaza, injuring three
of them. Israeli soldiers fired on the children on their way to school
in Central Gaza. One of the children was shot in the back, a second in
the left foot and a third in the right foot.<br><br>
Jewish  settelers attacked Arab homes in Nazareth ,thorowing stones at
Arab  homes,  fired rubber-coated bullets and tear gas at Palestinans.
Five  Palestinians  were  reported  injured.  Earlier hundreds of Jews
encircled  the  home  of  Arab  Knesset  member Azmi Bishara, shouting
"death  to the Arabs," and "we'll kill all the arabs." During the last
ten  days clashes between the 1948 Palestinains and the Israeli police
left 11 dead and over 300 injured.<br><br>
