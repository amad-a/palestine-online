<p>Daily  ‘Ha’aretz’  reported  that Tel Aviv was holding contacts with the PA
via  several  channels  to  crystallize  a deal that would calm things down
topped  by  a  ceasefire  and resumption of negotiations. The deal includes
confidence-building measures to alleviate sufferings of Palestinians during
the fasting month of Ramadan.<br><br>
Senior   Israeli  security  sources  have  affirmed  that  the  Palestinian
Authority  had arrested last night a number of Islamic Resistance Movement,
Hamas,  activists  in Nablus on suspicion of planning armed attacks against
Israeli targets.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
