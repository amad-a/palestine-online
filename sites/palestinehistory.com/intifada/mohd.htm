<p>One day story of a 12yr old boy called Mohammed al-Durah<br><br>
This  is not a 'Long American movie' where the American hero is always
in  control,  using the latest hi-tech arms to kill criminals, and the
'enemy'.  This  is a live scene from the street of a densely populated
city,  where  more then 1 Million Palestinians spent their whole lives
in  camps,  and  under Israeli occupation, the following story is from
Gaza  City  in  the Gaza strip , which is sometimes not on the maps of
Americans.<br><br>
It  is just the start of the winter in Gaza where children play in the
narrow  corridors of the camp in the rain. Yes, it is raining, but not
water , it's raining bullets, rockets, and Palestinian blood.<br><br>
The  city has been boiling with anger for three days now (as is in all
of  Palestine)  reacting  to the provocative visit of Sabra & Shateela
terrorist,  Ariel  Sharon,  to holy site of Al-Aqsa mosque, and to the
massacre  carried out by the Israel army, and police in Al-Aqsa mosque
on  Friday during prayers, killing and wounding many worshipers. Gaza,
where  the  first  Intifada started (1987) , joined from the first day
the  new Al-Aqsa Intifada, showing their anger, and demanding that the
world  re-visit  the  issue of Palestine, and appealing to the Islamic
world  to  protect Al-Aqsa and Al-Qouds ( Jerusalem ) from the Israeli
plans  to  destroy  the holy mosque, and replace it with their claimed
'Temple'  which  was  never  found, and archeologically proven to have
never been there.<br><br>
Mohammed  al-Durah (a 12 years old boy ) , opened his eyes to the news
of Al-Aqsa Intifada, dreaming of a chance to participate, there was no
school  today,  as per the general strike role. The loving father took
him, as usual, to the market in order to go on with the family's daily
life.<br><br>
Mohammed's  destiny took him with his father to Al-Shuhada road, there
is no other way home. Did they reach home?<br><br>
They  were  ambushed  with  a  heavy  rain  that  was  very heavy, and
continuous  for  more  then  45  minutes. The rain was coming from one
direction toward Mohammed al-Durah and his father, it was raining live
red  killing  bullets from inside a well secured place in Netzarim, an
Israeli  kibbutzim in Gaza city . The helpless father and his son were
shouting at the Israeli killers to stop the shooting, and at the world
to help save their lives.<br><br>
The  rain  stopped, only after Mohammed took his last breath , and the
father couldn't shout for help any more , an ambulance driver lost his
live by attempting to rush the boy, and his father to medical care.<br><br>
The  Israeli  message  to  the  world  was  clear,  "We  will kill any
Palestinian  alive, regardless of his/her age, sex, armament , if they
were  protesting  or not, throwing stones or not ... we have orders to
shoot  live ammunition, on any moving body, in head or chest ... shoot
to  kill  ...  ,  that's the order, we will kill also any one who will
try, or even consider helping or saving any of our targets ."<br><br>
What kind of people kill a 12 yr old boy in his father's lap, and even
kill  a  red cross personel for trying to save the boy, and his father
from the massacre ?<br><br>
This story is just one of hundreds which was not told to the world .<br><br>
end of story ..<br>

Quote  "I  appeal to the entire world, to all those who have seen this
crime  to  act  and  help me avenge my son's death and to put on trial
Israel.<br><br>
I  also  plan  to take Israel to the international courts and ask that
the criminals responsible for the death of my son be punished.<br><br>
It  is  the  worst  nightmare  of  my life... My son was terrified, he
pleaded with me, 'For the love of God protect me, Baba'.<br><br>
I will never forget these words." Unquote<br><br>
We will all not forget Mohammed el-Durah</p>
