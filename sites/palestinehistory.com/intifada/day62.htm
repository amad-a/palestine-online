<b><div align="center">Day 62 : Tuesday 28.11.2000</div></b>
<p>One  Palestinian  was  killed by Israeli occupation soldiers on in the West
Bank.  Ibrahim Abed Kahla (24 years old) from the village of Ramon, died of
coronary  arrest  when  Israeli  occupation  soldiers chased and fired on a
group  of  Palestinian  youths  who  were  throwing  stones  at the Israeli
occupiers.<br><br>
Two  other  Palestinians  died  of  wounds  they  had  sustained earlier in
confrontations  with  the  Israeli  occupiers. Karam al Kurd (14 years old)
from  gaza and Imad al Dayeh (17 years old) from the Shati’ refugee camp in
Gaza.<br><br>
Palestinian  human  rights  watch  group has declared that Israel was using
ammunition   containing   depleted  uranium  against  Palestinian  civilian
targets.  Depleted  uranium  was  used to add more penetration power to the
shells.  The  material leads to serious health hazards to both the military
and civilians topped by chemical poisoning and radiation dangers.<br><br>
The  Israeli  army  attacked  with  tear  gas  canisters the Zahra’ school,
causing  several  children  to  faint as a result of gas inhalation. Around
noon,  the  Israeli  troops  opened  fire  on school children at the El-Ram
school.<br><br>
A  Palestinian  Authority official has rejected recent Israeli and American
proposals for a new interim agreement styled after the Oslo Accords.<br><br>
In  Hebron,  the  occupation army re-imposed curfew on the estimated 40,000
Palestinians  living  in  the  old  town  where nearly 300 fanatic settlers
decide the tune for the entire city, under the protection of the occupation
army.<br><br>
The  Israeli occupation army has sealed most of the villages and hamlets in
the northern parts of the West Bank preventing inhabitants from bringing in
food supplies from the main large towns.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>

soldiers near the Karni crossing, east of the Gaza Strip. (Photo 1)<br><br>
Palestinian  taxi drivers argue with Israeli soldiers outside the West Bank
town  of  Hebron.  The Palestinian taxis were trying to cross over an earth
barricade  blocking  one  of the entrances to Hebron when an Israeli patrol
showed up. The taxi drivers were let go after indentification checks by the
soldiers. (Photo 2)<br><br>
