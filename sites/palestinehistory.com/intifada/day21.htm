Over a hundred Palestinian injures were reported .<br><br>

Thousands of Palestinians took to the streets on the West Bank voicing
their rejection of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement and vowing to keep up
the  Aqsa  Intifada  until  the  Palestinian people regain freedom and
liberation from the Jewish occupation.<br><br>

rubber  coated  steel  bullets  against the Palestinians demonstrators
causing number of injuries.<br><br>
Giorgio Giacomelli A U.N. investigator mandated by the U.N. Commission
on  Human  Rights to the Palestinian territories reported the scale of
Palestinian  deaths  at  the  hands of Israeli forces during a wave of
violence  over  the  past  20  days  was  "  unprecedented  ." He also
expressed   concern   about   what   he   called   Israeli  settler  "
paramilitaries  "  who  he  said  were  responsible  for at least five
Palestinian deaths in the West Bank.<br><br>
"  In  some  sense the scale of this violation is unprecedented. It is
worthy  of  note that the number of deaths caused by Israeli forces so
far  approximate  the  number  killed  in the first four months of the
intifada,  in 1987-88" Giacomelli said in his seven-page report issued
in  Geneva.  The report also said that Israeli forces " appear to have
indiscriminately  used  excessive  force  in  cases where there was no
imminent threat to their lives. "<br><br>
The  report  add  that about 40 percent of an estimated 2,000 to 3,700
Palestinians  wounded  by  Israeli occupation forces were under age 18
and  that  at least half of the injuries resulted from the use of live
ammunition.<br><br>
"  Presently,  the  Israeli  settler  population  has  emerged  as  an
increasingly obvious source of paramilitary activity. Numerous reports
indicate  that  Israeli occupation forces have not acted to deter such
paramilitary activities " Giacomelli report said.<br><br>
According  to  the  report, Israel, refused to cooperate with the U.N.
investigator .<br><br>
