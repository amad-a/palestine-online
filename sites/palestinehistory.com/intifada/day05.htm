<div align="center"><b>Day 5 : Monday 02.10.2000</b></div>
<p>Violent  confrontations  between  heavily  armed  Israeli soldiers and
unarmed Palestinian protesters continued for the fifth consecutive day
,  with  the  Israeli  army  using  heavy  machine  guns and anti-Tank
missiles  in  a  desperate  effort to quell Palestinian anger over the
desecration  of  Muslim holy places in Jerusalem by Israeli opposition
leader Ariel Sharon.<br><br>
The  Intifada continue in almost all the main cities of Gaza Strip and
the West Bank . The latest reports showed that the total from Sunday's
events  reached  12  martyrs and the injuries 430 , at least 22 of the
wounded  sustained gunshot wounds in the head and the chest, and their
condition was listed as between serious and critical.<br><br>
In  Gaza  Strip, Israeli helicopter gunships have attacked Palestinian
police  positions.  The attack helicopters bombarded three cars at the
Netzarim  Junction, killing two policemen and injuring others. The use
of the Israeli air force against Palestinian protesters is viewed as a
dangerous  escalation  aimed  at  subjugating the evolving Palestinian
intifada.<br><br>
Moreover,  various  manifestations  of  unrest continued to take place
across  the  Green  Line  (1948-Palestine),  with  Palestinian  youths
hurling   stones   on  Israeli  soldiers  and  blocking  entrances  of
Palestinian towns. At least two Palestinians from the 1,200,000 strong
Palestinian  community  in  the  Jewish  state  were killed by Zionist
bullets.  Over  a  hundred people were reported injured, including ten
sustaining seriously injuries.<br><br>
