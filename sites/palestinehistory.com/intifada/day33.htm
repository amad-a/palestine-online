<p>The  Old  Town  of  Hebron,  where some 30,000 Palestinians live, have been
under  a  curfew  since  28 October, and Israeli soldiers don't hesitate to
shoot  to  kill  Palestinians  who  get  out  of  their  homes  even for an
emergency.<br><br>

Bank.<br><br>

intersection north of Hebron, injuring one Palestinian.<br><br>
A  Jewish  settler  hit  a  45 years old Palestinian woman and run from the
village of Beitlo to the west of Ramallah. Her condition is critical.<br><br>
In  the first incident, an attacker opened fire on two Israeli soldiers who
were standing guard outside the offices of "the social security department"
in  East  Jerusalem.  One  guard  was  killed  immediately  while the other
sustained serious injury. The attacker fled the scene.<br><br>
In the second incident, an Israeli settler from the settlement of Gilo near

Palestinians.<br><br>
Helicopters  fired  missiles at offices belonging to the Fatah organization
in Ramallah and Nablus.<br><br>

Israeli  helicopters  also strafed Palestinian residential areas in several
localities  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip  with heavy machine guns,

city  of  Al-Bireh completely destroying the premises and severely damaging
