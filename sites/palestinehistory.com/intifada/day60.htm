<p>Israeli  occupation troops killed five Palestinians, affiliated with Hamas,
near  Kalkilya.  The  five  killed are Qusay Zahran (22 years old), Mahmoud
Yousef  al Adle (23 years old), Muhammed Mansour Odwan (20 years old), Ziad
Ghaleb Selmi (17 years old) , and Mahdi Qasem Jaber.<br><br>
The  five  martyrs  were  killed  in cold blood and didn’t take part in any
armed  clash as alleged by the Israeli occupation authorities. The Israelis
refused to allow the Palestinian Red Crescent to reach the area.<br><br>
Elsewhere,  one  Palestinian Zakariya al Ghoul was killed in the Gaza Strip
when  Israeli  occupation  soldiers  opened fired on Palestinian protesters
near the Mintar Crossing.<br><br>
Hamas  organized  a  carnival in Nablus to mourn martyr Ibrahim Abdul Karim
Bani  Odeh  one  of the commanders of the Qassam Brigades, military wing of
Hamas, who was assassinated by Israeli intelligence last Thursday.<br><br>
Five Israeli occupation soldiers were wounded, two of them seriously when a
road-side charge exploded into an Israeli armored vehicle in Gaza.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
Palestinians  walk  past an Israeli jeep as they are permitted to cross the
Kissufim  checkpoint on the road between Gaza and Khan Yunis in the central
Gaza  Strip.  Most  of  the  day the checkpoint is closed, cutting the Gaza
Strip  in  two  and preventing Palestinian traffic between its northern and
southern parts. (Photo 1)<br><br>
Palestinians  carry the body of Fouad Dwekat, who was killed November 25 in
clashes with Israeli soldiers, during a funeral procession in the West Bank
city of Nablus. (Photo 2)<br><br>
