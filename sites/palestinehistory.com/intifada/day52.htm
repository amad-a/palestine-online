<p>Yasser   Arafat  ordered  Fatah  activists  to  stop  shooting  at  Israeli
occupation targets from Palestinian towns.<br><br>
One  Israeli  soldier  was  killed  and two others were injured when a lone
Palestinian  guerrilla Bahauddin Said (23-year-old) overran an Israeli army
outpost  opposite  the  Jewish settlement of Kfar Dorom and opened fired on
the  soldiers  inside their sleeping chamber. The Palestinian guerrilla was
martyred  by other soldiers. In retaliation, Israeli tanks pounded Force-17
position  in  Khan  Younis,  causing  considerable damage and injuring four
Palestinian soldiers.<br><br>
Yom-Tov  Samia,  commander of the Israeli occupation army in Gaza Strip was
seen firing from his own gun at demonstrators near Khan Younis. He was also
seen  scolding his soldiers for using teargas canisters only and for firing
at  the  legs. He urged them to fire live bullets at the higher part of the
Palestinian bodies.<br><br>
Jewish  settler  families living on occupied West Bank are planning to move
to Israel due to the Intifada.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
