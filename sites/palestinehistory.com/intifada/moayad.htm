<p>One more school child couldn't return to home ..<br><br>
On  16  October 2000 , Israeli army sniper killed a Palestinian school
child  in  a  cold-blooded  manner  in  Bethlehem  while the child was
returning  home  from school. The child, 14 year old Moayad Jawareesh,
was  fatally  wounded  when  Israeli  soldiers  stationed  on building
rooftops  in the vicinity of the Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque opened fire on
a  group of school children who were returning from school at the Ayda
refugee camp in Bethlehem.<br><br>
The  Palestinian child, who was still carrying his school bag, was hit
with a live bullet in the head. He died immediately.<br><br>
The  Israeli  occupation authorities claimed the children were hurling
stones toward the soldiers.<br><br>
On  17  October  2000,  Thousands  of  mourners  march  in  a  funeral
procession carrying the body of Moayad Jawareesh to the graveyard.</p>
