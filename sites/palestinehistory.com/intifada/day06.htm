<div align="center"><b>Day 6 : Tuesday 03.10.2000</b></div>
<p>Despite  a cease-fire understanding between Israel and the Palestinian
Authorities,  violent clashes and confrontations between heavily-armed
Israeli soldiers and stone-hurling Palestinian protesters continued in
several parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip .<br><br>
Israeli  forces  were  firing  rubber  bullets  and tear gas shells at
schools,  in addition to snipers stationed on rooftops opening fire at
Palestinian protesters as well as pedestrians.<br><br>
The total of Palestinian martyrs who were killed by the Zionists since
Friday has reached 60, with the injuries topping the 2000 figure.<br><br>
At  least  two  Palestinian  protesters  were killed and as many as 15
others  were  wounded  when  heavily-armed Israeli occupation soldiers
opened  fire at a group of Palestinian youths hurling stone at Zionist
outposts  near  to  Netzarim  Junction in the central part of the Gaza
Strip.<br><br>
This is some photos of what happened today.</p>
