<p>For  another weekend , Palestinians argue with Israeli riot police officers
at  the  entrance to the Al Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem's Old City to
allow  them  to  enter the Mosque. Israeli security forces banned access to
Friday prayers to all Muslim men under the age of 45.<br><br>
Five  Palestinians  were  martyred and two Israeli occupation soldiers were
killed during confrontations throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<br><br>
Among  the  martyrs  were  two  brothers Samir Adel Amer (24 years old) and
Nihad  Adel  Amer  (26  years  old)  from  the village of Kufer Kallil near
Nablus,  who were killed when Israeli tanks bombarded the village on Friday
night.  One  of the martyrs was a physically handicapped boy Ziad Abu Jazar
at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip. In Jenin, two boys Aysar Mahmoud and
Ghassan al Qura’an were earlier killed by Zionist bullets.<br><br>
Two  Israeli  soldiers were killed, one in khan Younis while the other near
the Beit Hanun crossing in Gaza.<br><br>
Thousands  of  Palestinian  citizens  offered  the  Friday  prayers  at the
Ibrahimi Mosque in Khaleel (Hebron) for the first time in two months due to
its closure by Zionist occupation authorities.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
