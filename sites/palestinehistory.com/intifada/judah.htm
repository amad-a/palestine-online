<p>Jewish settlers burn Palestinian to death<br><br>
Jewish settlers abducted a Palestinian farmer Isam Judah Mustafa Hamed
from   his  olive  orchard,  took  him  to  their  nearby  settlement,
bludgeoned him to death with clubs and axes and then set his mutilated
body on fire.<br><br>
The  settlers,  armed  with  Uzi  submachine guns, abducted Isam Judah
Mustafa Hamed, 42 Years old , in early morning hours Monday 09.10.2000
while  picking  olive  on his olive orchard at the village of Um Saffa
near Ramalla. They forced him into an awaiting car at gun point.<br><br>
At  10 o'clock , villagers found his charred and mutilated body dumped
at the roadside.<br><br>
This  one  of the most shocking attack by Israeli settlers and Israeli
army  .  The body, as per number of doctors and as per next photos, is
burnt  and  bearing signs of torture including extensive burn marks on
his face . Isam Judah , murder seems to have been the latest in a long
and ugly history of attacks by settlers against innocent Palestinians.<br><br>
On  October  10, 2000 , Palestinians pray in a central Ramallah mosque
over the body of Isam Judah during his funeral . After Judah's funeral
several   hundred   Palestinians  confronted  Israeli  troops  on  the
outskirts  of  this  West  Bank  town  and held running stone-throwing
battles for several hours.</p>
