<b>Day 42 : Wednesday 08.11.2000</b>
<p>At  least  three  more Palestinian youths were killed by Israeli occupation
soldiers  .  In Gaza, two youths were shot and killed by Israeli occupation
soldiers   during  protests  near  the  Egypt-Palestine  borders.  A  third
Palestinian,  a 13-year-old child was also killed by Israeli bullets at the
village of Kefel Hares, near Nablus. Two more Palestinians died of injuries
they  sustained  earlier  this  week  near al Mintar crossing, bringing the
total  number  of  Palestinian  martyrs since the outset of the uprising to
188.  The  number  of  the  injured exceeded the 7000-figure, with hundreds
sustaining serious wounds.<br><br>
A Jewish settler was killed and another seriously injured when the car they
were  driving was attacked by Palestinian guerrillas near Gaza airport. One
woman  settler was immediately killed and her friend seriously injured. The
Israeli  helicopter gunships were seen hovering over Palestinian population
centers in the area.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>

checkpoint in front of Gush Kitaf Jewish settlement near Khan-Younes in the
Gaza Strip.<br><br>
The  body  of  Palestinian  Ahmad Kaffash wrapped in a Palestrinian flag is
carried  aloft  as  his funeral procession in the West bank city of Nablus.
Eleven  year  old Kaffash was the victim of a hit and run car accident on a
main  highway  outside  Nablus used primarily by Jewish settlers. The boy's
brother  said  they  were  standing at the roadside when a car with Israeli
license plates deliberately drove at them. (Photo 2)<br><br>
