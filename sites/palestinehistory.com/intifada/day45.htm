<p>Palestinian police officials today handed over a Jewish settler who strayed
into the West Bank town of Tulkarm to Israeli police.<br><br>

The  settlers  have  been  responsible  for  the  murder  of  at  least ten
Palestinian  farmers  since  the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada on 28
September.<br><br>
Two Palestinian guerillas were martyred and two occupation soldiers injured
one  seriously,  during  armed  clash  in  the southern Gaza Strip. The two
Palestinians  were  killed  when  the car they were riding came under heavy
machinegun fire from a nearby Israeli outpost.<br><br>
A third Palestinian, 14 year old Basel Abu Qamar, of Gaza, was shot dead by
Israeli  soldiers near the Beit Hanoun crossing at the northern of the Gaza
Strip.<br><br>
An  Israeli soldier died of wounds he sustained during clashes in Bethlehem
on Friday.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
