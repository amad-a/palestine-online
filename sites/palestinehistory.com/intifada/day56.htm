<p>Four  Palestinian  university students civilians were killed and eight were
seriously  injured  when  an  Israeli  tank  opened fire on two Palestinian
passenger  cars  in  the  Gaza  Strip. The four are Jamal Abdul Qader, Awni
Ismael, Khalil Sha’er and Nayel Shehdeh. The Wife of one of the martyrs was
also  seriously  wounded. The Israeli army prevented Palestinian ambulances
from taking the wounded to hospitals in Gaza.<br><br>

least  25  injured  five  of  them  listed  in serious condition and one in
critical condition.<br><br>
Two  schools  were  vacated  after  school children found a small explosive
device in the school yard.<br><br>
The  Israeli  army  dismantled  the  wholesale  vegetable  market in Hebron
apparently to please the Jewish settlers .<br><br>
Jewish settlers attacked Arab villages in the central and northern parts of
the West Bank, injuring several Palestinian civilians and vandalizing their
fields.  Near  the  village  of  Ein  Yabrud, near Ramallah, armed settlers
opened  fire  on  a  group  of  Palestinians  injuring two of them. Another
Palestinian  was seriously injured at the village of “Seilet Althaher” near
Jenin  when  armed settlers fired at Palestinians who were harvesting their
olives.<br><br>

earlier  decision  not  to  send  its  ambassador to Tel Aviv until further
notice.<br><br>
