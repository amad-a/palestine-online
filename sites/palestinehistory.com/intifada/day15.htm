Two  Israeli  undercover  soldiers  provocatively  arrived in Ramallah
during  a  funeral  procession  of  one  of the victims of the Israeli
repression of Palestinians.<br><br>
The  soldiers,  who  apparently  were  on  a  mission  to  assassinate
Palestinians,  were  discovered  and taken to a nearby police station,
where angry Palestinians eventually killed them.<br><br>
A  Third  Israeli  soldier  reportedly  fled  away. Palestinian police
reported   a  small  machineguns  and  silencers  were  found  in  the
possession of the undercover soldiers.<br><br>
Israeli helicopter gunships began bombing Palestinian Authority police
headquarters  in  Ramallah.  The  bombing  target  the  several police
stations  and  headquarters  of  PA  security  agencies.  The  bombing
resulted in at least 16 injures. (Photo 2)<br><br>
Later  on,  Israeli  helicopters  hit  four  major  positions in Gaza,
including the headquarters of Force-17, the Naval police headquarters,
the  Gaza  Port  and a the Police Academy in the southern outskirts of
Gaza.<br><br>
PA  forces  were  put  on high alert and PA Chairman Yasser Arafat has
appaled  to  the  international  community  to  intervene  to stop the
Israeli  aggression and provide protection for the Palestinian people.
