<p>The  visit  of  Sabra  and  Shatela  terrorist  Ariel  Sharon (Israeli
opposition  Likud  party  leader) to Haram al-Sharif of Al-Aqsa Mosque
compound  caused  a  lot  of  tension  and  anger  to  the Palestinian
worshippers  who  tried not to allow Sharon from entering the Mosque ,
and  pushed  him  to  short-cut  his  tour and return back by throwing
stones  on  him and on his security which was more then few hundreds .
Israeli  riot  police  and  Sharon security clashed with the protested
Palestinian and left a big number of them injured .<br><br>
Sabra and Shatela terrorist Ariel Sharon took this tour to the Al-Aqsa
complex to demonstrate that Israel is in control and to give a message
to  the  Palestinian and the Islamic world that Israel will never give
back Al-Aqsa Mosque to them and that this is a holy area to Jews where
they  claim that it has been build on the place of there holy 'Soliman
Temple'  and  they  will  work  to  demolish  Al-Aqsa  and build there
'Temple' on it's place .<br><br>
This is some photos of what happened today.</p>
