<b><div align="center">Day 8 : Thursday 05.10.2000</div></b>
<p>Clashes  between  Palestinian  protesters  and  heavily  armed Israeli
troops  resumed  Thursday  evening  in  several  parts of the Occupied
territories despite an earlier cease-fire.<br><br>
Four additional Palestinian Martyrs killed by Zionist snipers Thursday
afternoon.  One  more  Palestinian  youth was killed near Bethlehem, a
second  in  Gaza  and  a  third  succumbing to injures he sustained in
Monday's  clashes.  The  death  total  of Palestinian casualties is 71
martyrs  and  2369  injures, scores of them sustaining serious gunshot
wounds.<br><br>
On  04.10.2000  ,  A meeting between Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak
and  PA chairman Yasser Arafat held in Paris, ended indecisively after
Barak   refused  Palestinian  demands  that  a  neutral  international
commission  of  inquiry  be  formed  to  look  into Zionist atrocities
against  Palestinian  civilians  killed and maimed scores of children.
The  Israeli  army  used helicopter gunships and anti-tank rockets, as
well   as   heavy   machine-guns  against  stone-throwing  youngsters,
prompting  human rights observers to label as the Israeli overreaction
as  "a  true  carnage."  .  The  indiscriminate killing of Palestinian
protesters  began last on 28 September when Israeli war criminal Ariel
Sharon  paid  a  provocative visit to the Haram al Sharif compound, in
utter defiance of Muslim sensibilities .<br><br>
The martyrs' total of Wednesday's clashes was nine., resulted bringing
the  death total to over 70 since the beginning of Israel's carnage of
Palestinians  since  28  September.  So far, Israeli occupation forces
have injured 2657 Palestinians.<br><br>
