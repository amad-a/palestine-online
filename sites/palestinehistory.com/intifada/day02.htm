<div align="center"><b>Day 2 : Friday 29.09.2000</b></div>
<p>Israeli  riot  police  stormed the Al-Aqsa compound and opened fire on
worshippers,  killing seven Palestinians and wounding 220 in the worst
bloodshed  in  four  years .<br><br>
Violence began during Friday prayers when the compound was filled with
20,000 worshippers. Israeli Officers fired rubber-coated steel pellets
and snipers shot live rounds on the prayers just before the end of the
pray.  Number of Palestinians hit by rubber bullets fell to the ground
and were carried away on stretchers.<br><br>
As  news  of  the clashes spread, riots erupted in other areas of Arab
East  Jerusalem  and  the  West Bank. In Bethlehem, rocks littered the
main road and thick clouds of black smoke from burning tyres rose into
the  skies.<br><br>
Sharon's  visit  was  the  trigger  for  the  violence  and  that many
casualties  were the result of a "pre-planned massacre" by the Israeli
security forces.<br><br>
This is some photos of what happened today.</p>
