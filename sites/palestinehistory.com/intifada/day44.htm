<p>An  Israeli  policeman  was  wounded  in a blast in East Jerusalem. Initial
inquiries  indicated  that an explosive charge went off near Bab EL-Khalil,
an  entrance  to the walled city. Israel sealed off surrounding streets and
carried out a search of the area.<br><br>
The  Israeli  soldiers  allowed  only  a  small numbers of Muslims to reach
al-Aqsa Mosque.<br><br>
Six  Palestinians  were  martyred during protests and marches following the
Friday  prayers.  The martyrs are Hani Marzouq (35 years old), Ziad Fahmawi
(22 years old), Osama Za’aouka, all from Jenin, Ra’ed al Muhtasib (25 years
old) from Hebron, and Osama Jarjawi and Muhammed Hamed of the Gaza Strip.<br><br>
Nearly  200  Palestinians, among them 50 children, have been martyred since
al-Aqsa Intifada started on 28 September, and as many as 7000 injured, many
seriously.<br><br>
