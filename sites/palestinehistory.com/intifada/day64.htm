<p>Two  more Palestinian children were murdered by Israeli occupation soldiers
and settlers in the West Bank.<br><br>
Walid  Ahmed  Albadan  (14  years  old)  from  the  village  of  Tkou’ near
Bethlehem,  was killed when Israeli soldiers positioned on the rooftop of a
multistory  building,  opened fire on school children outside the village’s
school as they were returning home.<br><br>
Earlier,  a  Jewish  settler  from  the settlement of Ifrata, south west of
Bethlehem,  ran  over  13-year-old  Shadi  Ahmed, of the village of Housan,
killing  him  immediately.  The  settler careened to the roadside where the
Palestinian  child  was  awaiting  his  brother  and  hit him hardly before
fleeing the site. The child bled to death as Israeli occupation soldiers in
the  area  refused  to  allow  a  Passing  Palestinian  car  to take him to
hospital.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>

shot dead by Israeli soldiers near the Karni crossing in Gaza. (Photo 1)<br><br>
