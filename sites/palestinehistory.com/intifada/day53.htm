<p>Two  Palestinians  were  shot  dead  by  Israeli  soldiers  in  Gaza Strip.
14-year-old  Abdul  Rahman  Dahshan  was  killed  when  Israeli  occupation
soldiers opened fire on a group of youngsters who were standing opposite an
Israeli  garrison  outpost  in  Gaza. The children were not involved in any
stone  throwing. And a 38-year-old Naser Ahmed Najjar Palestinian policeman
died of tear-gas inhalation in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.<br><br>
Israeli  army destroyed three houses in the Gaza Strip in what seemed to be
a  reprisal  for  Palestinian  protests against Jewish military occupation.
Israeli  army  bulldozers  demolished  the  houses located on the Salhuddin
Street without any legal cause.<br><br>
Israeli  diplomat  Yoram Habibyan was lightly injured in Amman when his car
came under fire.<br><br>
Here are some photos of today :<br><br>
