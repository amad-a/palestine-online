04.01.2000 , Palestinian officials say they have reached an agreement with
Israel under which a long delayed transfer of Israeli occupied West Bank
land to Palestinian control will be implemented in the next 48 hours ,
according to Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</p><a name="14jan00"></a><p>
14.01.2000 , Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein is reportedly
conducting an assessment of possible charges against Israeli President Ezer
Weizman. Weizman is suspected of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars
in gifts between 1988 and 1993 without reporting the gifts to authorities.
</p><a name="20jan00"></a><p>
20.01.2000 , Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in Washington this
morning for a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</p><a name="27jan00"></a><p>
27.01.2000 , In the first taint of scandal to touch his government, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's party was fined $3.2 million for campaign finance
violations, and the attorney general said it was opening a criminal
investigation. Barak said he hadn't known of any illegal practices, and
asserted that the campaign finance law was unclear. After the state
comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, imposed the fine, the office of Attorney
General Elyakim Rubinstein said "there are grounds to instruct the police
to open an investigation" of the matter. The probe will include past
campaign finance practices by other parties as well, the Justice Ministry
said. Barak said that he "honored" the comptroller's report, but said "in
light of the large fine" the party was considering appealing to the Supreme
Court.</p><br>

02.02.2000 - In the latest round of peace talks, the Palestinians have
flatly rejected an Israeli map that would keep large chunks of the West
Bank under Israeli control. Tayyeb Abdel Rahim confirmed for the first time
that Israel submitted a map delineating proposed future borders. Israel's
plan would annex swaths of land on the eastern and western fringes of the
West Bank, as well as settlement blocs, Abdel Rahim said. Israel and the
Palestinians are less than two weeks away from a deadline for agreeing on a
peace treaty outline, but little progress has been made in three months of
negotiations.
</p><a name="03feb00"></a><p>
03.02.2000 - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat held talks this morning concerning a framework
Israeli Palestinian peace deal.
</p><a name="07feb00"></a><p>
07.02.2000 - Israeli warplanes attacked three power stations and a
Hezbollah guerrilla stronghold in Lebanon. The move was in response to the
recent killing of four Israeli army officers .
</p><a name="09feb00"></a><p>
09.02.2000 - An Israeli government report published acknowledged what
Palestinians and human rights groups have said for years - that Israel
systematically used illegal force against Palestinian suspects during the
Intifada. The State Comptroller's report, written in 1997 but withheld by
the government until now, said Shin Bet security agents who interrogated
suspects also systematically lied about their actions to their superiors
and to the courts. The report covers the years 1988-92, when the Intifada,
or Palestinian uprising against Israel, was at its height. Unprecedented
numbers of Palestinians were being arrested and interrogated
</p><a name="21feb00"></a><p>
21.02.2000 - Palestinian officials urged U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to apply
pressure on Israel to restart the stalled Mid-East peace process.</p><br>

21.03.2000 - Kissing Palestinian earth and warmly welcomed by Yasser
Arafat, Pope John Paul II made a prayerful pilgrimage to the town of Jesus
birth that also provided a powerful boost to Palestinian statehood hopes.
In a momentous day marred by rock throwing after he left a Palestinian
refugee camp, the 79-year-old pope celebrated an open air mass before a
crowd of thousands in Bethlehem's Manger Square and sank to his knees in
prayer in the dim grotto where Christian tradition says Christ was born.
Amid tight security, the atmosphere was peaceful at all the pope's
appearances. But in a graphic display of frustration and volatility in the
Palestinian lands, several hundred youths at the Dheisheh camp - apparently
angry over heavy handed treatment by Palestinian security forces - engaged
in a rock throwing clash with police just over an hour after the pope had
finished his visit there.
</p><a name="24mar00"></a><p>
24.03.2000 - Israel and the Palestinian Authority are extending their
inconclusive talks into next week, still "brainstorming" over the future of
Jerusalem, Palestinian aspirations for a state and other knotty issues.
"It's too early to know if this will lead to anything," Hassan Abdel
Rahman, the chief PLO representative in Washington, said. An Israeli
official, meanwhile, said the "chemistry" was good at the screened off
talks at Bolling Air Force Base in southeast Washington. After Friday's
meetings the Israelis and Palestinians scheduled a break for the Jewish
Sabbath, beginning at sundown, and plan to resume Saturday night. Rahman
said they would meet next week, as well. When the negotiations opened
Tuesday, about a week of talks was anticipated.
</p><a name="30mar00"></a><p>
30.03.2000 - Palestinians staged marches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -
and in some cases clashed with Israeli troops - to protest the confiscation
of Arab owned land and Jewish settlement expansion. At least 15
demonstrators were injured. The most serious clash was in the Israeli Arab
town of Sakhnin, where police said about 400 demonstrators broke through a
fence surrounding an Israeli army base. Police fired rubber coated steel
bullets at the demonstrators, wounding 15. The director of the Sakhnin
medical center said 12 were lightly wounded, two suffered head wounds and
another had a broken leg. Hundreds of protesters stoned Israeli soldiers in
two locations outside the West Bank town of Nablus where troops fired tear
gas and rubber coated steel bullets.</p><br>

07.04.2000 - Israeli and Palestinian negotiators began a new round of talks
against a backdrop of an Egyptian warning that Israel must agree to a
Palestinian state in order to have real peace. Negotiators convened at
Bolling Air Force base in southeast Washington, with American mediators
ready to intervene later in the day to push for an agreement that has
eluded the two sides. The negotiators also met for dinner Thursday evening
at the base, which is screened off from the public and news media. Despite
a 1979 peace treaty, Egypt told Israel on Thursday it could not expect a
warm peace unless it consented to a Palestinian state and "dealt with
Jerusalem." Egyptian Ambassador Nabil Fahmy said Israelis "do not
understand the frustration Arabs feel that there is still occupation."
</p><a name="12apr00"></a><p>
12.04.2000 - In a concession to the Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak accepted President Clinton's proposal to increase U.S.
involvement ahead of a May deadline for a peace treaty outline, a senior
Israeli official said. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat complained this
week that the most recent round of U.S.-sponsored talks has not come up
with anything concrete. Arafat is demanding Israel agree to a Palestinian
state on the West Bank and in Gaza with part of Jerusalem as its capital. A
failure to meet a Sept. 13 deadline for a full-fledged peace agreement
could precipitate a complete breakdown in negotiations and a return to
violence.
</p><a name="26apr00"></a><p>
26.04.2000 - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said during a visit to France
that he expected European leaders, notably French President Jacques Chirac,
to help advance the Middle East peace process. "His excellency President
Chirac is working with all his capabilities to push forward the peace
process," Arafat said in Paris. The Palestinian leader was meeting with
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin later Wednesday. Arafat was
visiting France ahead of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,
which are due to resume on Sunday at Eilat, an Israeli resort city on the
Red Sea.</p><br>

</p><a name="01may00"></a><p>
01.05.2000 - A Palestinian state is already a fact, and an
Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty will simply define its limitations, an
Israeli Cabinet minister said. Haim Ramon's comments sounded a conciliatory
note a day after talks got off to a sour start over Jewish settlement
expansion in the West Bank. However, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
he would declare statehood sometime after Sept. 13, the peace treaty
deadline, regardless of whether he had reached agreement with Israel by
then on the terms of independence. In the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat,
negotiators met for a second day to try to formulate a framework for a
final peace treaty. Such a framework is due by the end of the month.
</p><a name="04may00"></a><p>
04.05.2000 - Israel presented a map of a proposed Palestinian entity
covering about two-thirds of the West Bank to Palestinian negotiators, who
refused to consider it and broke off the session . It was the first time
Israeli negotiators outlined in detail how they envision the future borders
of what they have said would likely be a Palestinian state. Palestinian
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the entity proposed by
the Israelis on Wednesday covered about two-thirds of the West Bank and was
divided into several large parcels of land that were not contiguous. The
Palestinians want to establish a state in all of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, with east Jerusalem as its capital
</p><a name="08may00"></a><p>
08.05.2000 - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat failed to bridge "very large gaps," making it unlikely a
peace treaty outline will be ready by next week's target date, summit
participants said . Barak, meanwhile, confirmed for the first time that he
wants to hand three West Bank suburbs of Jerusalem to full Palestinian
control, but said he may not be able to go through with the plan for weeks
or even months because of strong opposition - including from members of his
own coalition. The Palestinians have been angered by Israel's proposal to
annex one-third of the West Bank. Barak said the final borders must be
drawn in such a way that the absolute majority of the 200,000 Jewish
settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will come under Israeli
sovereignty
</p><a name="12may00"></a><p>
12.05.2000 - Palestinians demonstrated throughout the West Bank Friday to
demand the release of Israeli-held prisoners, as Israeli radio stations
reported secret meetings between Israel and the Palestinians in Europe. A
few Palestinians were injured in Bethlehem from inhaling tear gas shot by
Israeli soldiers, Israel's army radio reported. There were also clashes in
Ramallah and Qalqilya. About 400 Jewish settlers also protested Friday in
the West Bank, demanding that the Israeli army move a checkpoint that they
say causes security problems. No disturbances were reported, according to
the army spokesman.
</p><a name="15may00"></a><p>
15.05.2000 - In some of the worst violence in years, Israeli troops and
Palestinian police fought fierce gun battles , and at least three
Palestinians were killed and more than 320 injured as protests swept the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told parliament
he knew of at least four Palestinians killed, but Palestinian hospital
officials could not confirm that. In one tense standoff, Israeli snipers
commandeered a West Bank hotel, forcing dozens of guests and staff,
including nine Americans, to seek cover in the lobby. Across the West Bank
and Gaza, thousands of Palestinians battled with Israeli troops, hurling
stones and firebombs. The violence came despite a decision Monday by the
Israeli Cabinet to transfer three West Bank villages near Jerusalem to
Palestinian control in a goodwill gesture.
</p><a name="19may00"></a><p>
19.05.2000 - In its largest offer so far, Israel has proposed that the
Palestinians take control of 90% of the West Bank. The offer was rejected
by the Palestinian. The offer was made and turned down during last week's
round of talks in Sweden.
</p><a name="24may00"></a><p>
24.05.2000 - The last Israeli troops and tanks rolled out of Lebanon ,
completing a swift and dramatic pullout from the southern zone Israel
occupied for nearly two decades. Muslim guerrillas swiftly moved into
territory left behind by the Israeli troops and their allied militia,
seizing several tanks and vehicles.</p><br>

13.06.2000 - With a White House admonition that "time is short," Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators are resuming their sputtering talks on an
overall settlement that their governments pledged to conclude by
mid-September. It is supposed to determine the future of Jerusalem and how
much land Israel will cede to the Palestinians for a state. Refugee and
water problems also were on the agenda for the talks at Andrews Air Force
Base in suburban Maryland and at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington.
While negotiators at one site wrestle with long-range issues, the other
negotiators will consider how much land Israel will surrender in a West
Bank pull back due this month.
</p><a name="16jun00"></a><p>
16.06.2000 - After denouncing Israel's prime minister as lacking a desire
to conclude a peace accord, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with
Israel's chief negotiator. Shlomo Ben-Ami and Arafat talked at Andrews Air
Force Base in suburban Maryland, one of the two sites of the slow-moving
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Negotiations in
Washington have sputtered, partly broken off by the Palestinians to protest
Israel's refusal to release 250 prisoners and to agree to Arafat's terms
for a pull back this month on the West Bank.
</p><a name="27jun00"></a><p>
27.06.2000 - Adopting a tough stance ahead of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's arrival, Palestinian officials said the time was not right for a
Mideast summit and suggested that Palestinian statehood will be proclaimed
this fall with or without Israel's blessing. Albright was in a route to the
Mideast to assess prospects for a U.S. hosted summit in which Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would try to form
the outlines of a final peace treaty. Barak is eager to attend such a
top-level gathering. Arafat is reluctant to agree to a summit, saying the
gaps are still too wide. Palestinian officials have said Arafat fears U.S.
mediators will side with Israel on many issues and he will be pressured
into concessions.</p><br>

05.07.2000 - In a high-risk bid to bring peace to the Middle East,
President Clinton announced Israeli and Palestinian leaders would meet with
him next week at the Camp David presidential retreat to try to reach an
accord by mid-September.
</p><a name="13jul00"></a><p>
13.07.2000 - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat held their first one-on-one summit talks (since the summit
started in 11'th July) as the two sides grappled with the "tough issues"
standing in the way of a peace agreement. The meeting last night in
Arafat's cabin at the Camp David presidential retreat, came at the two
leaders' initiative. The parties were grappling with tough issues that
involve their vital interests. The most contentious issues being addressed
include the status of disputed Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and whether more than 2 million Palestinian
refugees will be given the right to return to homes in Israel.
</p><a name="19jul00"></a><p>
19.07.2000 - Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak was reported to have sent a
letter to his summit host complaining that the Palestinians were not
negotiating in good faith. Clinton sent the summit into overtime when he
delayed a trip to Japan for a day. As the president met Wednesday morning
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat - their second talk in 12 hours -
Israel said "it seems" that Barak had decided to stop the talks and return
home. Since the summit began July 11, Clinton has been shuttling between
the two sides, trying to shepherd them toward an accord on the most painful
and divisive issues.
</p><a name="25jul00"></a><p>
25.07.2000 - The Middle East peace talks at Camp David collapsed in a
deadlock over the future of Jerusalem. Conceding failure, President Clinton
said the Israelis and Palestinians "couldn't get there." Clinton returned
to the White House to say that the gaps between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had not been bridged, but
forecast that they will be "because I think the alternative is
unthinkable." The Israeli and Palestinian delegations said in a statement
they intended "to continue their efforts to conclude an agreement on all
permanent status issues as soon as possible." Barak and Arafat spent two
weeks at Camp David with Clinton as the sponsor and sometimes personal
mediator in the peace talks.</p><br>

16.08.2000 - Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 70-year-old Palestinian
after the man opened fire from the roof of his home. The victim, Mahmoud
Abdullah, a U.S. citizen, was critically wounded by a shot in the head.
Israeli officers kept medics away from the scene for more than an hour.<br><br>
16.08.2000 - Israel and the Palestinians resumed high-level peace talks ,
three weeks after the collapse of negotiations at Camp David.
</p><a name="18aug00"></a><p>
18.08.2000 - In Prime Minister Ehud Barak's clearest statement yet about
Palestinian statehood, he offered the Palestinians an independent state if
they formally end their conflict with Israel. The remarks came as U.S.
State Department negotiator Dennis Ross began talks to see if the two sides
were ready to move toward a peace accord.
</p><a name="25aug00"></a><p>
25.08.2000 - Making a case for Israeli sovereignty over all holy shrines in
Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said that under Israeli rule no harm
would ever come to the two major mosques in the disputed city. The
Palestinians dismissed Barak's assurances and said they would not sign a
peace treaty without being granted sovereignty over east Jerusalem, which
includes the walled Old City.</p><br>

07.09.2000 - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has rejected U.S. compromise
proposals on Jerusalem. Sounding a similar tone, Israel Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said "Some of the ideas he has raised are beyond what we believe we
can accept. Nevertheless, If Chairman Arafat is ready to take Clinton's
ideas as the basis for negotiations, we will be ready to contemplate it and
to enter into such negotiations."
</p><a name="13sep00"></a><p>
13.09.2000 - Sept. 13 was supposed to be Palestinian independence day.
Instead, a deadline for establishing a state was missed for the second time
in 16 months, and Palestinian leaders desperately tried to maintain some
credibility by announcing gradual steps toward statehood, including general
elections. Over the weekend, the PLO's top policy-making body, the Central
Council, decided to postpone a statehood proclamation at least until Nov.15.
</p><a name="14sep00"></a><p>
14.09.2000 - The Clinton administration reopened talks with the
Palestinians in a bid to end a deadlock over the future of Jerusalem.
</p><a name="18sep00"></a><p>
18.09.2000 - Prime Minister Ehud Barak ruled out Islamic sovereignty over a
key Jerusalem shrine, closing the door to a Palestinian compromise
proposal. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are hung up because of a
sovereignty dispute over the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram
al-Sharif or Noble Sanctuary. Barak and Arafat accused each other of
intransigence and blamed each other for the deadlock.
</p><a name="20sep00"></a><p>
20.09.2000 - Israel and the Palestinians resumed contacts, a day after
Israel made conflicting announcements about the fate of negotiations, first
declaring a time-out, then saying talks were back on track.
</p><a name="28sep00"></a><p>
28.09.2000 - Israeli riot police fired rubber bullets at hundreds of
Palestinian stone-throwers at a Jerusalem holy site. The violence broke out
just moments after the leader of Israel's hard-line opposition, Ariel
Sharon, entered the compound. Chants of "Murderer, get out" followed
Sharon. Near the West Bank town of Ramallah, about 200 Palestinian
university students angered by Sharon's visit threw stones at Israeli
troops who fired rubber-coated steel bullets. Four Palestinians were
injured.</p><br>

in the bloodiest clashes in four years at a Jerusalem holy site. Scores of
Palestinian protesters were injured. Number of police, including the
Jerusalem police chief, were hurt by rocks during the violence in the
compound. Tensions have been running high since the Israeli opposition
leader, Ariel Sharon, visited the compound to demonstrate that Israel was
in control.</p><br>

03.10.2000 - The death of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy killed by Israeli
fire shocked the world. The death of the boy, Mohammed Jamal al-Durah, was
captured by French television. The images of his terrifying last moments
have come to symbolize the nature of the violent confrontations of the past
few days and the use of live bullets of the Israeli army against the
civilian Palestinians.
</p><a name="04oct00"></a><p>
04.10.2000 - Secretary of State Madeleine Albright brought Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat together to try to
get them to return to "the psychology of peacemaking." Barak said talks
won't resume until the violence ends. Albright held two rounds of separate
meetings with the two Mideast leaders and then convened a three-way
session. Arafat condemned the "virulent attacks against our people" and
said he would see Barak only if there was a guarantee that Palestinians
would be protected and an inquiry was launched into violence on the West
Bank and Gaza. In weeklong strife, more than 60 Palestinian have died.
</p><a name="12oct00"></a><p>
12.10.2000 - Israeli helicopters rocketed Yasser Arafat's residential
compound, police stations and broadcasting centers in a swift retaliation
for the killings of two Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian mob. The violence
was some of the worst in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the 1967
Mideast war. One of the missiles struck just 50 yards from Arafat's
headquarters, with the Palestinian leader inside the building during the
attack.
</p><a name="16oct00"></a><p>
16.10.2000 - In an atmosphere of high tension and mistrust, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met warily at an
emergency summit aimed at halting bloody clashes in the Mideast. "We cannot
afford to fail," President Clinton warned. He implored both sides "to move
beyond blame" after more than two weeks of clashes on the West Bank and
Gaza that left about 100 Palestinians dead. The summit was hosted by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who unmistakably blamed Israel for the
violence.
</p><a name="21oct00"></a><p>
21.10.2000 - Leaders from the Arab League have begun their first emergency
summit in four years in a bid to form a unified response to the violence
between Israelis and Palestinians. The summit convened with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat addressing the conference as widespread anti-Israeli
demonstrations throughout the Arab world placed increased pressure on the
leaders to show the depth of their commitment to the Palestinian cause. The
leaders are expected to denounce Israel for its treatment of the
Palestinians and for failing to complete its promised withdrawal from
occupied land in the West Bank and Gaza.</p><br>
