Subject : letter to Jamal Al Durra<br>
Date    : Monday, October 30, 2000 1:17 AM<br>
<br>Hi, Esam,<br>
Here is my letter to Mr. Al-Durra. If you can get it to him personally, I'd be
really grateful. If you like, you may publish it. I want to start breaking down
the barriers that keep us all from understanding and caring about each other.
<br><br>
Thank you, and please keep in touch! Let me know if Mr. Al-Durra reads the
letter.
<br><br>

<b>Open Letter to Mr. Jamal Al-Durra</b>
<br><br>
<b>Dear Mr. Al-Durra;</b>
<br><br>
Please accept my sincere and profound sorrow at the death of your son, Mohammed.
I know that my words are small compared to the terrible grief you and your
family are feeling. It is my own shock and sorrow that compel me to reach out to
you with my words—they are all the comfort I have to offer.
<br><br>
I am also the parent of a 12-year-old boy. He even looks a little like Mohammed.
I know you loved, and continue to love, your son, just as I love mine. There is
no way to measure the joy we feel in our children, nor the grief we endure at
their loss. When I watched you and your son against that wall, with no safe
place to go, and then saw the terrible outcome, I wept and pleaded with God to
help us all.
<br><br>
Words are inadequate to express to you what I felt and continue to feel. But I
can report to you that one small good thing has happened as a result. After days
of sorrow and tears, I felt moved to take action. I could not watch a child get
shot down in the street, even though he was thousands of miles away from me, and
then go on with my life as if nothing had happened! I began to look around on
the internet, to read the news from all points of view. I searched out sources
for the history of the current conflict, and educated myself beyond what small
information is offered in the news. I felt I owed it to little Mohammed, who so
reminded me of my own boy, to find out as much of the true story as I could. I
am still doing that, daily.
<br><br>
I have found out a lot that I was quite unaware of before. Now I know about
injustices done to Palestinian people under occupation, about prejudice and
humiliation they have suffered. Now I know about the breaking of international
law by Israeli Defense Forces. (Anyone who doubts this needs to look at the
report from Amnesty International at
http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/MDE150412000?OpenDocument&of=COUNTRIES\ISRAEL.
Now I also know that there are people of good conscience on both sides working
for justice, dialogue and peace. For instance, I found on the internet Jewish
Israeli groups who recognize the injustices, who abhor the way Palestinians have
been treated, and who disagree with the Israeli government’s policies. None of
this information has found its way into U.S. news reports, that I have seen.
<br><br>
As a result, I have dedicated my web site to your son, and I have filled it with
all the information I have found, in the hope that I can help educate others about
the whole truth in the Middle East. I hope you will be able to look at my site
sometime, and read the tribute I wrote to Mohammed.

<br><br>
I was glad when I heard that you are going to take the case of your son’s death
to international courts. I encourage you to do so. Mr. Al-Durra, you and your
family are in my thoughts and prayers. I hope for your speedy recovery and the
continued health and wellbeing of the rest of your family. I will never forget
your son Mohammed Jamal, and will work for peace and justice in his name.
<br><br>Sincerely,<br><b>Myrrh Sagrada</b><br>Oregon, USA<br></p><br>
