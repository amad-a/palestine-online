<p>An Israeli settler wearing a military uniform, Baruch Goldstein, a
well-known Kach leader and a physician from Kiryat Arba settlement in
Hebron, entered the Ebrahimi mosque and emptied two clips of a machinegun
into Moslem worshippers during the dawn prayer. At least 48 were killed in
the initial shooting (Name lised below), more were killed in incidents and
protest demonstrations follow the massacre. More than 300 are injured. Some
of them were critically injured.<br><br>
It started last night at the time for the final evening prayer on Thursday
February 1994, Jewish settlers and soldiers prevented Muslim worshippers
from entering the sacred masque to perform the evening prayer under the
pretext that this was the day of their "Boleme" feast. After some time, the
occupation forces allowed them to go inside the mosque in groups. At 10:00
P.M. the Muslim worshippers were asked to leave the mosque, and occupation
soldiers began beating many of them as they left.<br><br>
On February 25th 1994 on the holy month of Ramadan, there were many people
in the Ebrahimi Mosque to perform their prayers. Dr. Baruch Goldstein
passed two army checkpoints from the northeastern gate of the mosque.<br><br>
He execute his massacre when the more then 350 Muslim worshippers knelt on
the floor during there pray with their backs towards him. Hiding behind one
of the pillars in the mosque, he threw a hand grenade at the worshippers
causing casualties, confusion. And in no time he fired on the worshippers
with his rifle. A number of young men were able to get over to where the
attacker was and to protect others in the mosque with their bodies. And
within moments Goldstein had been brought to the ground by the young men.
The shooting lasted for more then ten minutes.<br><br>
The army didn't step in until the massacre was over. The soldiers, together
with a number of Jewish settlers, opened fire on those who had gathered
around Goldstein, and not one of them survived in a second massacre.
Outside the mosque, the soldiers opened fire on the ambulance which had
arrived at the mosque to treat the wounded.<br><br>
