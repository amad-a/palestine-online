<p>In the period from 1917 to 1949, Israel had occupied 78% of the land
of Palestine and evicted or caused to flee more than 750,000
Palestinian refugees to Gaza Strip , West Bank and other Arab
countries like Syria , Lebanon, Jordan and others.. It is the plight
of the Palestinian refugees, who now number 1.5 millions, and the fate
of the Palestinians, who now number 2.5 millions, as a people, which
have remained the most pressing problems.</p><br>
<center><b><font size="+1">The following are the main reasons of this refugee crisis</font></b></center>
<br><font size="+1"><center><b>1. The British mandate</b></center></font>
<p>The mandate charter stated, “the British mandate government should
encourage, in cooperation with the Jewish Agency, the mobilization of
Jews on state - owned lands throughout Palestine”. Accordingly, the
British High Commissioner in Palestine, Mr. Herbert Samo’yel, issued
the transfer of property law along with a number of annexes. By this
law, the High Commissioner issued a decree on July 1,1920
confiscating 3390 square dunums at Karm Abu Hussein area in Jerusalem.
In August 1924, the British mandate government confiscated large areas
of Palestinian land, and it has been given to Jewish Agency. The
British mandate government donated to the Jewish Potach Company 75,000
dunums and to the jewish Electric company 18.000 dunums free of charge
to build up their Jewish projects. The British High Commissioners
confiscate more Palestinian land for the construction of new roads for
jewish settlements. Palestinian villages were completely ignored and
the roads leading to these villages were themselves confiscated under
various British codes and regulations.</p><br>
<font size="+1"><center><b> 2 . The Partition Plan </b></center></font>
<p>The 1947 resolution on the partition of Palestine came only to
complement the unjust laws and military orders enacted by the British
mandate government. The partition of Palestine was unfair and illegal
because it failed to consult the majority of the Palestinians
estimated at that time at 90% of the total population of Palestine.
The resolution lacked justice and equality because it gave the Jewish
minority about 56% of the land, most of which was located at the
fertile coastal areas and 43% to the Palestinian majority, land lying
in rugged mountainous areas.<br><br>
As from 29th November 1947, a state of tension had been created
between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The British Government announced
its plans to withdraw from Palestine on 15th May 1948.<br><br>
The State of Israel had been all but born and it now only remained for
the Zionists to make sure that when it came into official being, on
15th May 1948, it should be as Chaim Weizmann, Israel's first
President, promised in 1921 that "Palestine will be as Jewish as
England is English."</p><br>
<font size="+1"><center><b> 3. The economical situation </b></center></font>
<p>Since 1920, the British mandate government has put Palestine in a
difficult economic, administrative, and political situation,
facilitating the establishment of a Jewish state and the displacement
of Palestinians to seek jobs in the adjusting Arab
countries .</p><br>
<font size="+1"><center><b> 4 . The zionist massacres </b></center></font>
<p>In order to push the unarmed defenseless Palestinian Arabs to leave
their homes. Jewish terrorist groups such as Irgun Zwei Leumi were
brought in when other methods failed. On 9th April 1948, the Irgun
Zwei Leumi led by Menachem Beigin, a former Israeli Cabinet Minister
and former leader of the Opposition in the Israeli Parliament,
attacked the small Arab village of Deir Yassin near Jerusalem. An
account of this barbaric massacre was given by Jacques de Reynier, the
Chief Delegate of the International Red Cross , who was able to reach
the village and witness the aftermath of the massacre: "Three hundred
persons" he said, "were massacred ... without any military reason or
provocation of any kind; old men women, children, newly-born were
savagely murdered with grenades and knives by Jewish troops of the
Irgun, entirely under the control of their chiefs."<br><br>
The objective behind the Deir Yassin massacre was to terrify the Arab
civilian population, and force them to flee to secure for the Zionists
the land without the people. The plan succeeded and they fled in
terror, to save their lives. Before May 15th, 1948, while the British
Government was still responsible, the Jews had occupied many purely
Arab cities like Jaffa and Acre and scores of villages that were in
the territory assigned by the U.N. Resolution for the Arab State and
evicted more than 300,000 inhabitants from their homes. In an attempt
to stem this tide, the neighboring Arab states sent their armies on
15th May 1948 into Palestine. On 15th July 1948 the U.N. imposed a
final truce between Israel and the Arabs, by which time Israel had
occupied an even larger part of the territory allotted to the Arab
State in Palestine.</p><br>
<font size="+1"><center><b> 5. Israeli Army </b></center></font>
<p>In view of the Israeli army hostilities which continued after the 1948
war, more Palestinians were forced to move to the Gaza Strip.</p><br>

<br><div align="center"><font size="+2"><font color="Blue"><b>Refugee issue in the United Nations</b></font></font></div><br>
<p>The U.N. Mediator in Palestine, Count Bernadotte, in his report
submitted to the General Assembly on 16th September 1948, stated: "It
is, however, undeniable that no settlement can be just and complete if
recognition is not accorded to the right of the Arab refugee to return
to the home from which he has been dislodged by the hazards and
strategy of the armed conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. It
would be an offence against the principle of elemental justice if
these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right to return
to their homes, while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine and indeed
offer the threat of permanent replacement of the Arab refugees who
have been rooted in the land for centuries." This statement cost Count
Bernadotte dearly. On the next day he and his French assistant were
assassinated in the Israeli sector of Jerusalem by Jewish terrorists.<br><br>
On 11th December 1948 the General Assembly discussed Bernadotte's
report and resolved: "that refugees wishing to return to their homes
and live at peace with their neighbour should be permitted to do so
at the earliest practicable date." This resolution has been annually
re-affirmed by the U.N. ever since, but Israel continues to defy the
U.N. and prevent the return of the refugees to their homes.</p><br>

<div align="center"><font size="+2"><font color="Blue"><b>The Zionist responsibility</b></font></font></div><br>
<p>It is of interest to note here that Zionist propagandists initiated,
in an attempt to shirk their responsibility towards the refugees, a
campaign stating that the refugees left their homes of their own free
will, obeying orders broadcast to them by their Arab leaders. Erskine
Childers, an Irish Journalist and author and at was the President
of the Republic of Ireland from 1973 to 1974, devoted months to look into this claim and
found it baseless. He examined the American and British monitoring
records of all Middle East broadcasts throughout 1948 and reported:
"There was not a single order or appeal or suggestion about evacuation
from any Arab radio inside or outside Palestine in 1948. There is
repeated monitored record of Arab appeals, even flat orders, to the
civilians of Palestine to stay put."<br><br>
Nathan Chofshi, a Jewish writer who emigrated from Russia to
Palestine. He stated: "If Rabbi Kaplan really wanted to know what
happened, we old settlers in Palestine who witnessed the flight could
tell him how and in what manner we, Jews, forced the Arabs to leave
their cities and villages …. Here was a people who lived on its own
land for 1300 years. We came and turned the native Arabs into tragic
refugees. And we still dare to slander and malign them, to besmirch
their name. Instead of being ashamed of what we did and of trying to
undo some of the evil we committed by helping these unfortunate
refugees, we justify our terrible acts and even attempt to glorify
them."</p><br>
<center><img src="image/line1.gif" border=0 alt="Line"></center>
<br><div align="center"><font size="+2"><font color="Blue"><b>Land Acquisition Law</b></font></font></div><br>
<p>Not only did the Israelis refuse to allow the return of the refugees
to their homes, but they consummated the tragedy by seizing all their
property in one of the greatest acts of plunder in modern history. The
confiscation of Arab land was not confined to the holdings of the
refugees but extended to the 200,000 Palestinians, who remained in
their homes in 1948, by a series of extraordinary laws and regulations
of legalized robbery. These included "The Land Acquisition Law," "The
Abandoned Areas Ordinance, 1949," "The Absentee Property Regulations,
1948" and others. The injustices, to which the Arabs in Israel were
subjected, went far beyond the expropriation of their farms and
property, and included flagrant infringement upon their basic human
rights and civil liberties.</p><br>
