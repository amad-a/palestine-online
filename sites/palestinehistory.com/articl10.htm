<p>20 Basic facts about the Palestine Problem<br>Did you Know?
<br><br>
1. THAT, when the Palestine Problem was created by Britain in 1917, more
than 90% of the population of Palestine were Arabs?... And that there were
at that time no more than 56,000 Jews in Palestine?
<br><br>
2. THAT, more than half of the Jews living in Palestine at that time were
recent immigrants, who had come to Palestine in the preceding decades in
order to escape persecution in Europe?... And that less than 5% of the
population of Palestine were native Palestinian Jews?
<br><br>
3. THAT, the Arabs of Palestine at that time owned 97.5% of the land, while
Jews (native Palestinians and recent immigrants together) owned only 2.5%
of the land?
<br><br>
4. THAT, during the thirty years of British occupation and rule, the
Zionists were able to purchase only 3.5% of the land of Palestine, in spite
of the encouragement of the British Government?... And that much of this
land was transferred to Zionist bodies by the British Government directly,
and was not sold by Arab owners?
<br><br>
5. THAT, therefore, when British passed the Palestine Problem to the United
Nations in 1947, Zionists owned no more than 6% of the total land area of
Palestine?
<br><br>
6. THAT, notwithstanding these facts, the General Assembly of the United
Nations recommended that a "Jewish State" be established in Palestine?...
And that the Assembly granted that proposed "State" about 54% of the total
area of the country?
<br><br>
7. THAT, Israel immediately occupied (and still occupies) 80.48% of the
total land area of Palestine?
<br><br>
8. THAT, this territorial expansion took place, for the most part, before
15 May 1948: i.e., before the formal end of the British forces from
Palestine, before the entry of Arab armies to protect Palestinian Arabs,
and before the the Arab-Israeli war?
<br><br>
9. THAT, the 1947 recommendation of the General Assembly in favour of the
creation of a "Jewish State" was outside the competence of the Assembly
under the Charter of the United Nations?
<br><br>
10. THAT, all attempts by the Arab States and other Asian countries to have
the Assembly submit the question of "constitutionality" of its
recommendation to the International Court of Justice for an "advisory
opinion" by the Court were rejected or ignored by the Assembly?
<br><br>
11. THAT, when the Assembly began to experience "second thoughts" over the
matter and convened for its second special session in 1948, it failed to
reaffirm the 1947 recommendation for the partition of Palestine-thus
destroying whatever dubious legality that recommendation for the
establishment of a "Jewish State" had had?
<br><br>
12. THAT, that original 1947 recommendation to create a "Jewish State" in
Palestine was approved, at the first vote, only by European, American and
Australian States...for every Asian State, and every African State (with
the exception of the Union of South Africa) voted against it?...And that,
when the vote was cast in plenary session on 29 November 1947, urgent
American pressures (which a member of the Truman cabinet described as
"bordering onto scandal") had succeeded in prevailing only upon one African
country (Liberia), both of which had special vulnerability to American
pressures, to abandon their declared opposition?...And that, in other
words, the "Jewish State" was planted at the point-of-intersection of Asia
and Africa without the free approval of any Middle Eastern, Asian or
African country except that Union of South Africa, itself ruled by an alien
minority?
<br><br>
13. THAT, Israel remained, ever since its inception, a total stranger in
the emerging world of Afro-Asia; and that Israel has been refused admission
to any inter-state conference of Asian, African, Afro-Asian, or Non-Aligned
States ever held?
<br><br>
14. THAT, since the General Armistice Agreements were signed in 1949,
Israel has maintained an aggressive policy of waging military attacks
across the Armistice Demarcation Lines, repeatedly invading the territories
of the neighbouring Arab States...And that Israel has been duly rebuked,
censured, or condemned for these military attacks by the Security Council
of the General Assembly of the United Nations on eleven occasions-five
times by the Security Council and six times by the General Assembly?
<br><br>
15. THAT, no other country in the world, whether member of the United
Nations or non-member, has been so frequently condemned by the United
Nations?
<br><br>
16. THAT, no Arab State has ever been condemned by any organ of the United
Nations for military attacks upon Israel( or any other State)?
<br><br>
17. THAT, besides expelling the bulk of the Arab inhabitants of Palestine,
and besides constantly attacking the neighbouring Arab States, Israel has
also consistently harassed the United Nations observers and other personnel
stationed along the Armistice Demarcation Lines: It has assassinated the
first United Nations Mediator and his military aide; it has detained some
truce observers; it has military occupied and illegally searched the
Headquarters of United Nations personnel; and it has boycotted meetings of
the Mixed Armistice Commissions?...
<br><br>
18. THAT, Israel has additionally imposed a system of apartheid upon the
Arabs who stayed in their homeland?...More than 90% of these Arabs live in
"security zones;" they alone live under martial law, restricting their
freedom to travel from village to village or from town to town; their
children are denied equal opportunities for education; and they are denied
decent opportunities for work, and the right to receive "equal pay for
equal work?"
<br><br>
19. THAT, notwithstanding the foregoing facts, Israel has always been, and
still is, widely portrayed in the Western press as the "bastion of
democracy" and the "champion of peace" in the Middle East?
<br><br>
20. THAT, the Western Powers have persisted in declaring their
determination to ensure a so-called "arms balance" in the area, as between
Israel, on the one hand, and the one-hundred million inhabitants of the
thirteen Arab States, on the other hand?... And this unilateral Western
doctrine of so-called "arms balance" is no more reasonable than the
suggestion that, in the Cuba-U.S.A conflict, there should be "arms balance"
as between Cuba and the United States... or that the whole Continent of
Africa should not be allowed to acquire more arms than South Africa... or
that Mainland China should not be permitted to have more arms than
Taiwan... or that the military allowed to acquire more arms than South
Africa... and that only thus can peace be safeguarded in the Western
Hemisphere, in Africa, in Asia, or in Europe?...</p><br>
