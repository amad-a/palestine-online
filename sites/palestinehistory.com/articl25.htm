<br><br>
- The Palestinian leadership of Nablus on Wednesday denied that citizens of
the West Bank town had celebrated the huge attack on the United States a day
earlier. The Nablus governorate said in a statement the Palestinians were
demonstrating against an incursion by Israeli forces into the autonomous
Palestinian town of Jenin.
<br><br>
"The Nablus governorate completely condemns the most terrible operation"
against New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington, it
said, expressing its condolences to victims and their relatives.
<br><br>
"We would like to clarify that people in the city of Nablus on Tuesday
evening were demonstrating against the Israeli incursion into the city of
Jenin and chanting 'God is great' to express their solidarity with their
brothers," it said.
<br><br>
It called reports that the rallies were a "celebration of what had happened
in the USA ... a complete defamation."
<br><br>
Retired schoolteacher Mustafa Ahlan said: "I don't like the Americans, but I
don't think bringing down planes full of civilians is going to help."
