<div align="center"><font size="+3" color="Blue"> Once Hopeful Palestinians Flee for Better Life Abroad </font></div>
<p>By TRACY WILKINSON, LOS ANGELES TIMES Staff Writer
<br><br>
RAMALLAH, West Bank - Samira Jubran was fulfilling a lifelong ambition. After
many years abroad in the United States, she returned to her Palestinian
homeland, was raising her small children and, with her husband, was about to
launch a business.
<br><br>
Nine months ago, they bought a prime piece of real estate on a Ramallah
hillside where they would open their offices.
<br><br>
Eight and a half months ago, Israeli-Palestinian clashes erupted and
quickly escalated into the deadliest fighting in this region in years.
<br><br>
Jubran's plans came crashing down around her. She and her family will leave
this land at the end of summer, joining a steady exodus of Palestinians who
are giving up on a future here. "A lot of good people are going," said the
38-year-old mother of four.
<br><br>
Throughout much of the last decade, tens of thousands of Palestinians
returned to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lured by landmark peace accords
that generated hope for a normal society and eventual sovereign state. Now,
after months of violence, hundreds of lives lost and the destruction of
uncounted volumes of property, the future "Palestine" is suffering another
crippling blow: the desertion of much of its elite, its entrepreneurs, its
best educated the people key to building a state. The void leaves religious
fundamentalists and political extremists with more prominence than ever.
<br><br>
The departures reflect not only how bad things are but also the loss of
faith that things will ever get better.
<br><br>
From prominent doctors and business people, to workers and students, many
Palestinians who have the chance to leave and who can penetrate a
suffocating Israeli blockade are seizing the opportunity. The move is a
controversial one; those leaving are often accused of betraying their future
state and abandoning the cause.
<br><br>
Officials in the government of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat deny that the departures are more than the usual ebb and flow
influenced by seasons and hard times. Many who go will come back, they say,
and many never completely settled here anyway.
<br><br>
Numbers are hard to come by, but the exodus is certainly becoming more
acute as school winds up for the year. At the Al Najah School in Ramallah,
which houses kindergarten through high school, at least 20% of the student
body is gone. At the Quaker-run Friends School, which is popular among
English-speaking Palestinians, 15% of the students have left or indicated
that they will not return in the fall, Principal Mahmoud Amra said.
<br><br>
Parents say they are leaving for the sake of their children, and they
struggle with competing draws: the values of tight-knit families and a
cohesive community that they can offer here versus the surety of opportunity
and distance from political bloodshed there. "There" is often the United
States; it may also be Latin America, Australia or Canada.
<br><br>
"Everybody came back here with the idea of doing something," said Hisham
Hamid, an economist who teaches at Bir Zeit University. "And now that isn't
possible."
<br><br>
'I Can See No Light at the End of the Tunnel'
<br><br>
Hamid has watched nearly half his neighborhood clear out. He sent his three
children to the U.S. in December, after their school filled with smoke and
tear gas one too many times. And he will leave at the end of the month,
after finals.
<br><br>
"I kept trying to convince myself that eventually things would get better,"
he said. "But it's only getting worse and worse. I can see no light at the
end of the tunnel. I've never seen or felt the hatred between Jews and
Palestinians like now."
<br><br>
To arrive at the university these days, Hamid and the entire faculty and
student body have to navigate around Israeli roadblocks that have sliced
much of the West Bank into dozens of isolated pockets. Palestinians say they
feel like hamsters in a cage, running and running and getting nowhere.
<br><br>
The exodus, he said, will further deplete business, banking and other
components of an economy that is already devastated by the fighting and
stiffened sanctions imposed by Israel.
<br><br>
"In the last four or five years, we had started to see the economy moving
in front of our eyes. We were building something new: a country. That's why
so many people came back," Hamid said. "But after this shock, people will
think about it, not twice but 100 times, before deciding to come back
again."
<br><br>
Jubran, the woman whose plans for a children's recreation business are in
ruins, was born and raised in Ramallah. She left for schooling, graduated
from San Francisco State University, married a Palestinian there and
returned just a few years ago. She wanted to go back to her cultural
foundations and was pleased to see that her children were learning Arabic,
had come to know their extended families and were understanding something
about national pride.
<br><br>
"We are really going to miss that," she said, seated under a broad pinyon
tree in the breezy front yard of her mother's home. "But we can't be sure
what's going to happen here tomorrow. Economically, politically, you can't
predict."
<br><br>
Jubran and her husband, Bassem, still hope that they can come back, one
day.
<br><br>
So dire are conditions in the West Bank and Gaza that some of those leaving
are not recent returnees but families who stayed here for decades, only to
give up now.
<br><br>
Nasser Jabra stuffed his over-sized suitcase with plastic bags full of the
olive-wood souvenir trinkets that he hopes to sell in his new home of
Brazil. Inexpensive crucifixes, rosaries and Christmas tree ornaments,
stamped with "Bethlehem" and "Holy Land," they are an unlikely currency to
purchase a new life in exile.
<br><br>
He left for Sao Paolo late last month, planning to establish himself and
eventually send for his elderly parents.
<br><br>
"I had good work, but since the intifada there are no tourists and no
business. Nothing. Nothing," Jabra, 28, said on the day he was boarding a
taxi to the West Bank border with Jordan; from there he would travel to the
Jordanian capital, Amman, and catch a flight to South America.
<br><br>
Jabra is from Beit Jala, a largely Christian town near Bethlehem that has
seen heavy damage during the current intifada. He lived in Brazil once
before, for about a year in 1998, under the auspices of a Christian
missionary group. The same organization is helping him resettle now.
Exchanging the sleepy, tormented West Bank for the vivacious culture and
customs of Brazil is a transition that worried Jabra. But in Brazil, you can
live, he said. Here, he and dreams of Palestine are slowly dying.
<br><br>
"There, in one year, you have 10 years of experience you can do and see so
much," he said. "Here, even 10 years of life is like just one year of
experiences. Life is static. In the last nine months I can't even see
Jerusalem"--barely two miles away but off limits to most Palestinians
without special permits.
<br><br>
Jabra's departure was bittersweet for his mother, 67-year-old Georgette.
<br><br>
"I feel like my soul is leaving my body," she said as she watched her son
pack, wiping her tears with a pink tissue. "I'm just telling him, settle
down and we will follow. With all of my heart, I want to get out of here."
<br><br>
Life has become so dangerous and unpredictable for Samir abu Mohor that he
is preparing to move his family to Australia, sight unseen.
<br><br>
Abu Mohor, a 42-year-old native of Beit Jala, has lived through hard times.
He saw the Israeli capture of the West Bank in 1967, the military
occupation, the first intifada in the late 1980s and early '90s, and the
advent of Palestinian Authority rule. But never did it get this bad.
<br><br>
"We have handled a lot and suffered a lot," said Abu Mohor, a father of
four. "After the first intifada, we thought there would be peace and
prosperity. And look at us today. We are trapped.
<br><br>
"Even if [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon and Arafat came to me
personally to say that it's going to get better, I would not believe it. It
would be a miracle."
<br><br>
'What Choice Do I Have? Give Me an Alternative'
<br><br>
A welder who specializes in wrought-iron work for homes and buildings, Abu
Mohor had never been without work until now. Not many people are ordering
ornamental iron grills for their homes, and, besides, Abu Mohor couldn't
reach his customers if he had any.
<br><br>
He dips into his savings to cover daily expenses. Telephone and electricity
bills are stacking up. The other day, he had to borrow money from his
elderly father, a move that is a source of great shame, he said. And night
after night he has had to watch helplessly as his children quake in terror
from the bullets flying into their bedrooms.
<br><br>
The last of the visas for Australia just came through, and the family will
leave for Sydney in August. Abu Mohor has never been to Australia, but a
brother is there, and he is sure to help him find a job.
<br><br>
"I know they are civilized, calm people in Australia. It is a beautiful
country where there is no shooting and everyone minds his own business," Abu
Mohor said.
<br><br>
Abu Mohor was speaking in his living room. He wore shorts and a sleeveless
T-shirt. Time was, he would have dressed for a visitor. But the energy for
that is gone. His older sons sat on a front patio smoking a narghile.
<br><br>
Friends and neighbors, some of them, urge him to stay. But his
neighborhood, sitting along the confrontation line, has become a ghost town.
Many of the residents have fled to safer streets.
<br><br>
Does he feel that he is abandoning the project of a future Palestinian
state?
<br><br>
"It bothers me a lot, but what choice do I have? Give me an alternative.
Give me security. If we had security, I would stop others from leaving."
<br><br>
Fatima Abdel Jabbar knew that it was time to go when her 5-year-old
pronounced his burning desire to die a shahid a martyr.
<br><br>
"You see this, and you realize your child's childhood has been stolen,"
said Abdel Jabbar, 35.
<br><br>
It now seems paradoxical, but the Puerto Rican-born Abdel Jabbar moved to
Beitin, a village outside Ramallah, six years ago, to build a safer life for
her children. Beitin was her father's home, and his father's home. A
community of many well-to-do Palestinian Americans, it was her home, too,
during many of her formative years, and it was her dream to come back. She
was happy to see her own children exploring the nearby caves, neat olive
groves and Roman water wells, and playing with familiar neighbors.
<br><br>
Then the West Bank became a veritable war zone. The three-mile drive to
pick her kids up from school turned into a tortuous 20-mile trek over back
roads and through two Israeli army checkpoints. More than once she's gotten
trapped in a gun battle along the way. And then her youngest started talking
about "the gift" of dying "for Palestine" like the scores of children killed
in Israeli-Palestinian clashes.
<br><br>
"You want to save your kids from those school shootings in the United
States and from the drug wars. You think of the serenity and peace and quiet
here, and then, boom!" she said.
<br><br>
'There Is No Safety Here for the Children'
<br><br>
Like many Palestinian women who have returned from the diaspora, Abdel
Jabbar lives alone with her children, while her husband lives and works in
the U.S., coming to visit every couple of months. The plan was to continue
that way until they had saved enough money to put all the children through
college. Then he would join the good, simple life in Beitin.
<br><br>
Now, instead, he's worried sick about his wife and children, she said. She
has already sent her two eldest daughters to St. Louis, and she and the
three younger ones expect to join them in August. It breaks her heart to
have to go.
<br><br>
"There is no safety here for the children," she said, weeping lightly. "But
when we go somewhere else, we will not be welcome. We will never belong
anywhere. We won't fit. It's crazy, but that is our destiny."
