<p>By: Zayd Hammoudeh

Is peace in the Middle East possible ? As long as the Israeli regime
continues its genocide and violation of international law, the atmosphere
that would facilitate peace shall not exist. Prime Minister of the Israeli
occupation forces, Ehud Barak, charged Chairman Yassir Arafat of not being
a “peace partner,” on October 8, 2000, merely ten days into the recent
intifada. In a press conference, Barak asserted, “The picture which has
emerged is that probably we have no partner for peace ... [but] our hands
are clean because we turned every stone in order to arrive at peace.”
Therefore, Zionist Prime Minister Barak contends that Israel is not at
fault whatsoever for the violence that has gripped occupied Palestine.
During peace negotiations, the most obvious and simple method to create a
lasting peace agreement would be to follow United Nations Security Counsel
Resolutions. Although Barak and the Israelis have “turned every stone in
order to arrive at peace,” they have not by any stretch of the imagination
complied with a majority of the resolutions that dealt with the Palestinian
question. This is not one isolated incident. Israeli prime ministers,
including Barak himself, have shown an unquestionable policy when dealing
with these declarations, refusal to comply. Israeli failure to abide by
United Nations Resolutions began with the continuous violations of United
Nations Security Counsel Resolution 194 is not the sole example of
international law that Barak and the Israelis have unmistakably
contravened. Even a declaration officially accepted by Israel, United
Nations Security Counsel Resolution 242, is not adhered to. In that
specific motion, the United Nations affirmed that all Israel claims to
lands captured, occupied and eventually annexed had no validity whatsoever
and were condemned. The resolution demands the, “Withdrawal of Israeli
armed forces from territories occupied in the [Six Day War].”
<br><br>
Even recently passed United Nations Resolutions are ignored by Mr. Barak.
On October 20, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly passed a
declaration by a margin of 92-6, (two of the dissenting votes came from the
Israeli and American ambassadors), with 46 abstentions, that “condemns acts
of violence, especially the excessive use of force by the Israeli forces
against Palestinian civilians.” The “excessive force” that had been
authorized by Barak included: Apache Attack Helicopters, heavily artillery,
heavy automatic weapons, and tanks. Yet, even after the motion was passed
by such as large margin, Barak and the Israelis continued utilizing these
same weapons.
<br><br>
The Jewish settlements, are in direct violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention, of which the state of Israel is a signatory. Passed in 1949 in
response to German atrocities in the Second World War, the Fourth Geneva
Convention establishes a humane standard for the treatment of civilians
during wartime, including: diplomats, spies, hostages, bystanders and
civilians in occupied territories. The agreement outlaws torture,
collective punishment and the resettlement by an occupying power of its own
civilians in the occupied lands. Section III, discussing “occupied
territory,” article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states, “Protected
persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived.
<br><br>
Even the existence of the settlements directly contravenes with the Fourth
Geneva Convention. Section III, article 49 of the motion simply proclaims,
“The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian
population into the territory it occupies.” Therefore, Israeli has
illicitly transplanted its citizens into Palestinian territory while the
Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits it.
<br><br>
The Jewish settlements, in what the United Nations Security Counsel has on
numerous occasions described as “occupied territory,” (the Gaza Strip and
West Bank), are not the only example of Palestinian land the Barak and the
Israelis have attempted to annex during peace negotiations. During the Camp
David Summit, when Barak offered Chairman Arafat sections of Jerusalem, he
adamantly refused to grant the Palestinians all of the land illegally
captured in 1967, including the “Old City” where the third holiest site in
Islam can be found, the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Not only was this in violation of
United Nations Security Counsel Resolution 242 but also the Fourth Geneva
Convention.
<br><br>
When it comes to the treatment of prisoners in Israeli custody, the Fourth
Geneva Convention is regularly violated. Shin Bet, the Israeli secret
service has openly admitted that they utilize “moderate physical pressure,”
in cases where they believe the prisoner has knowledge of about potential
attacks on Israeli interests. However, section I, article 31 forbids such
actions establishing, “No physical or moral coercion shall be exercised
against protected persons, in particular to obtain information from them or
from third parties.”
<br><br>
The Israelis and Barak undeniably defy the United Nations United
Declaration of Human Rights, as ratified by the General Assembly on
December 10, 1948, while simultaneously disobeying the Fourth Geneva
Convention. For instance, the motion states, “No one shall be subjected to
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” In
addition, the Fourth Geneva Convention in section II, article 27 requires,
“Protected persons who are confined pending proceedings or subject to a
sentence involving loss of liberty, shall during their confinement be
humanely treated.” However, on January 11, 1998, the Israeli High Court of
Justice rendered a decision effectively allowing the torture against their
Palestinian prisoners.
<br><br>
However, the change in the Israeli premiership is upon us. Yet, do not
expect a change in the tyrannical practices of a regime built on theft,
rape, murder, and terrorism. The new Zionist Prime Minister will most
likely be worse than his predecessor. Ariel Sharon, a convicted war
criminal, masterminded the 1982 invasion of the Brothers and Sisters in
Lebanon. The same man whose despicable actions forced the hesitant hand of
the Israeli government to find him only indirectly responsible for the
massacres of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refuge
camps.<p></p><br>
