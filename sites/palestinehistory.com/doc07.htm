President's statement:<br><br>
The members of the Security Council reaffirm their
determination to support an active negotiating process in which
all relevant parties would participate leading to a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace to the Arab-Israeli
conflict. In this context they agree that an international
conference should facilitate efforts to achieve a negotiated
settlement.<br><br>
However, the members of the council are of the view that there
is not unanimity as to when would be the appropriate time for
such a conference.<br><br>
In the view of the members of the council, the Arab- Israeli
conflict is important and unique and must be addressed
independently on its own merits.</p>
