<p>Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East(UNRWA) , was
established by United Nations General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) of
8 December 1949 to carry out direct relief and works programmes for
Palestine refugees. The Agency began operations on 1 May 1950. In the
absence of a solution to the Palestine refugee problem, the General
Assembly has repeatedly renewed UNRWA's mandate, most recently
extending it until 30 June 2002.<br><br>
Since its establishment, the Agency has delivered its services in
times of relative calm in the Middle East, and in times of
hostilities. It has fed, housed and clothed tens of thousands of
fleeing refugees and at the same time educated and given health care
to hundreds of thousands of young refugees.<br><br>
UNRWA is unique in terms of its long-standing commitment to one group
of refugees and its contributions to the welfare and human development
of four generations of Palestine refugees. Originally envisaged as a
temporary organization, the Agency has gradually adjusted its
programmes to meet the changing needs of the refugees. Today, UNRWA is
the main provider of basic services - education, health, relief and
social services - to over 3.6 million registered Palestine refugees in
its five fields of operations: Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab
Republic, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Some 1.1 million refugees live
in 59 recognized camps, and UNRWA's services are located in or near
these camps where there are large concentrations of refugees.<br><br>
Unlike other United Nations organizations which work through local
authorities or executing agencies, UNRWA provides its services
directly to Palestine refugees. It plans and carries out its own
activities and projects, and builds and administers facilities such as
schools and clinics. The Agency currently operates or sponsors over
900 installations with 22,000 staff throughout its area of operations.
Because UNRWA services such as education and health care are the type
of services normally provided within the public sector, the Agency
cooperates closely with governmental authorities in the area of
operations, who also provide some services to Palestine refugees.</p><br><br>
