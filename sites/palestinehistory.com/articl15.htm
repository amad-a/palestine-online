<p>By Ray Hanania<br><br>
Much is made of how Israel "accepted" the United Nations Partition Plan,
and the Arabs rejected it, thus launching a wave of anti-Arab propaganda
that has haunted the debate over Palestinian rights for half a century.
<br><br>
The argument, offered by the Israelis, goes something like this: Israel
compromised and accepted half of British Mandated Palestine. The
Palestinians and Arabs rejected the compromise causing the events of
their loss that followed.
<br><br>
It's not quite like that, though. And, it didn't start on Nov. 29, 1947
when the UN General Assembly barely approved the Partition Resolution.
<br><br>
In fact, the real vote occurred on September 8, 1947 when the United
Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) released a controversial
report calling for the Partition of Palestine. Dissenting members of
UNSCOP endorsed a "Federal Solution" in which Jews and Arabs would manage
Palestine together.
<br><br>
But why was Partition recommended?
<br><br>
Haganah forces had already laid out a detailed plan to occupy the
majority of Mandated Palestine and had been given advance information on
British Plans to depart. In fact, they had assurances from the British,
the United States that the State of Israel would receive international
recognition and the backing of the United Nations.
<br><br>
The Haganah was receiving arms and men from Europe and with the help of
the British and also the Americans, while the British maintained a nearly
airtight blockade of Arab volunteers trying to stream into Palestine to
fight with Palestinian irregulars.
<br><br>
In contrast, armies from neighboring Arab States were prohibited from
entering Palestine by the British, while armed Jewish volunteers streamed
in under the watchful eye of the British. (On March 24, 1947, the Arab
League accused Britain and the US of interfering and blamed them for the
deteriorating conditions.)
<br><br>
But Israel needed the partition plan and knew in advance that it was
unacceptable to the Arabs because Arab allies on UNSCOP had led the
opposition during committee debates.
<br><br>
It was very simple. If Israel accepted the Partition and the Arabs did
not, Israel would be free to continue its aggressive military land grab.
If the Israelis accepted "Federation," they would be forced to halt their
military advances and give up hope of an Independent State.
<br><br>
Meeting in Sofar, Lebanon Sept. 16th through the 19th, the Arab League
did what Jewish leaders expected, they denounced the UNSCOP Partition
Plan. The Arab League made a strong argument, pointing out the so-called
"Jewish State" consisted of a majority of Christian and Muslim
Palestinians. The unworkable plan proposed dividing Palestine into six
separate regions. The "Jewish" and "Arab" states would each consist of
three intersecting segments, looking like a six square chess board with
one side having black squares and the other with red squares.
<br><br>
On Sept. 26, British Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones announced
that the British Mandate would terminate. The deadline of May 14 was not
publicly announced until one month later, although the Jewish leadership
already knew the date.
<br><br>
On Sept. 29, 1947, the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine, which had
only been recently allowed to return to Palestine after a 10 year exile,
announced it would reject the UNSCOP Partition Plan. They endorsed the
Federation plan that recognized Palestine's independence.
<br><br>
The Jewish Agency had privately rejected Federation, but waited until the
Arab Side announced their position first, before telling the world they
would "accept" Partition, announcing it on Oct. 2, 1947. American
endorsement came on Oct. 11.
<br><br>
Arab critics accused the Jewish Agency of insincerity, charging Haganah
forces were already advancing on dozens of Palestinian Villages in and
out of the proposed Partition Plan areas assigned to the "Jewish State."
<br><br>
Politically at the United Nations, the Jewish Agency had won its battle
for perception, falsely claiming at the United Nations podium during
debates that followed that they, the Jews in Palestine, had endorsed
compromise and the Arabs had rejected it.
<br><br>
That public posture allowed them to continue to attack Arab villages
without condemnation from their American or British supporters, who kept
the United Nations deadlocked on resolution after resolution introduced
to denounce the Haganah and Irgun attacks.
<br><br>
On November 29, 1947, with some minor modifications, the UN voted to
recommend the Partition Plan, approving it by a vote of slim margin of 33
votes, with 13 voting against, 10 abstaining in protest, and the entire
Arab delegation walking out in protest.
<br><br>
This concept of having rejected "compromise" has haunted the public
posture of the Arabs and Palestinians, and undermined all future Arab
efforts to justify its case against an unfair Partition Plan.
<br><br>
With no one to complain, Jewish forces stepped up their military
occupation of Arab villages and land outside of the proposed Jewish State
area. They had priorities: rid the proposed Jewish areas of Arabs to make
the Jewish population a the Jewish population a "MAJORITY by force," and
to capture additional land to make the state defensible.
<br><br>
Haganah forces launched battles in Jaffa and Safad, targeting Arab
residents there, and stepped up their attacks and terrorist bombings in
Jerusalem, which was designated as an "International Zone" outside of
both proposed states.
<br><br>
Examples of pre-Independence assaults on Arab villages by the Haganah
included: Abu Kebir, (Jaffa), Dec. 6; Tireh (Haifa), Dec. 13; Khisas
(Safad), Dec 19; Qazaza (Ramleh), Dec. 20; Jerusalem, Dec. 29; Balad
al-Sheikh (Haifa), Dec. 30; Abu Shusha, Jan. 3, 1948; Shafa Amr (Haifa)
and Tamra (Nazareth), Jan. 19; Sukreir (Gaza), Jan, 26; Sa'Sa (Safed),
Feb 14; Biyar and Ads (Jaffa), March 5.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, US President Harry Truman played a deceptive game of politics
that favored the Jewish forces: On March 18, 1948, Truman met secretly
with Chaim Weizmann at the White House and pledged US support for Jewish
independence.
<br><br>
In a deceptive move the next day, Truman's UN representative called for a
suspension of the Partition Plan and endorsed an UN Supervised truce to
work out a "Trusteeship" to replace Partition. On March 20, The Arab
League endorsed the trusteeship idea, proposing a cessation of
hostilities. But that day, Weizmann and the Jewish Agency rejected
Trusteeship and any hope of a real peace.
<br><br>
In that light, the Jewish attack against Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948
where 254 civilians were murdered, was intentional. Irgun forces, in a
plan supported at first by the Haganah, distributed Arabic leaflets in
Jerusalem warning other Arabs of a similar fate. Dozens of captured
villagers were paraded through Jerusalem's Jewish Sector on an open
truck.</p><br>
