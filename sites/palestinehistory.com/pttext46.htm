<p>In Jan'93 , Israel deported 415 Palestinian men
to a buffer zone in southern Lebanon on Dec. 17,
1992. This occurred during Israel's peace talks
with Arab states and led to a temporary breakdown
in the negotiations.<br><br>
Southern Lebanon had frequently been a staging
area for attacks on Israel's northern settlements.
The deported Palestinians were said by Israeli
authorities to be active members of the militant
Islamic resistance movement known as Hamas. Late
in January, Israel's High Court ruled that the
deportation was legal. The government of Israel
nevertheless announced that all the deportee
would be allowed to return home within a year.</p>
