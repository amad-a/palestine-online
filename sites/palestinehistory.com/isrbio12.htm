<p>Meir, Golda (1898-1978), served as prime minister of Israel from 1969 to
1974. During her political career, she supported large-scale immigration to
Israel and major housing and other construction programs. Her main problem
as prime minister was the territorial conflict between Israel and several
Arab nations. Meir followed a firm but open policy toward the Arabs.<br><br>
In October 1973, war broke out for the fourth time between Israel and the
Arabs. Israel suffered heavy early losses, and Meir's government was
severely criticized. As a result, she resigned in June 1974, even though
she had led the Labor Party to victory in the December 1973 elections.<br><br>
Golda Meir was born Golda Mabovitz in Kiev, Ukraine. Her family moved to
Milwaukee in 1906, and she later taught school there. In 1921, she went to
Palestine and joined a collective farm village.<br><br>
In 1948, part of Palestine occupied by Jewish and became Israel. Meir
served as Israel's minister of labor from 1949 to 1956 and as minister of
foreign affairs from 1956 to 1966. She was secretary general of the Labor
Party from 1966 to 1969.</p><br><br>
