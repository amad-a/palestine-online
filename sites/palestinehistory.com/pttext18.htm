<p>Begin, however,
was the first
Israeli leader to
achieve a peace
settlement with
an Arab state.<br><br>
It resulted from the surprise initiative of
President Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt, who in November
1977 flew to Jerusalem, where he addressed the
Knesset and called on Begin to begin peace talks.
After protracted negotiations sponsored by U.S.
President Jimmy Carter at Camp David, Maryland,
the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was signed in
Washington, D.C., on March 26, 1979. Although the
treaty ended the prospects for war between Israel
and Egypt, many issues remained between the two
countries, including the problem of arranging for
Arab autonomy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.</p>
