<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
In 1896 following the appearance of anti-Semitism in Europe, Theodore
Herzl, the founder of Zionism tried to find a political solution for the
problem in his book, 'The Jewish State'. He advocated the creation of a
Jewish state in Argentina or Palestine.<br><br>
In 1897 the first Zionist Congress was held in Switzerland, which issued
the Basle programme on the colonization of Palestine and the establishment
of the World Zionist Organization (WZO).<br><br>
In 1904 the Fourth Zionist Congress decided to establish a national home
for Jews in Argentina.<br><br>
In 1906 the Zionist congress decided the Jewish homeland should be
Palestine.<br><br>
In 1914 With the outbreak of World War I, Britain promised the independence
of Arab lands under Ottoman rule, including Palestine, in return for Arab
support against Turkey which had entered the war on the side of
Germany.</p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1916 - Sykes-Picot Agreement </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
Britain and France signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided the Arab
region into zones of influence. Lebanon and Syria were assigned to France,
Jordan and Iraq to Britain and Palestine was to be
internationalized.</p><br>
<a name="1917"></a>
<center><b><font size="+2"> 1917 - Balfour Declaration </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
The British government therefore issued the Balfour Declaration on November
2, 1917, in the form of a letter to a British Zionist leader from the
foreign secretary Arthur J. Balfour: “His Majesty's Government view with
favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish
people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of
this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which
may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by
Jews in any other country.</p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1922 - A Mandate for Palestine </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
The Council of the League of Nations issued a Mandate for Palestine. The
Mandate was in favor of the establishment for the Jewish people a homeland
in Palestine.</p><br>
<a name="1929"></a>
<center><b><font size="+2"> 1929 - The riots </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
In August 1929, the century's first large-scale attack on Jews by Arabs
rocked Jerusalem. The riots, in which Palestinians killed 133 Jews and
suffered 116 deaths. Mostly inflicted by British troops were sparked by a
dispute over use of the Western Wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque ( this site is
sacred to Muslims, but Jews claimed it is the remaining of jews temple all
studies shows clearly that the wall is from the Islamic ages and it is part
of al-Aqsa Mosque). But the roots of the violence lay deeper in Arab fears
of the burgeoning Zionist movement , which aimed to make at least part of
British-administered Palestine a Jewish state.<br><br>
The British had made promises to both Arabs and Zionists. The 1917 Balfour
Declaration supported the establishment of a "national home" for the Jews,
while pledging that nothing would be done to " prejudice the civil and
religious rights" of the Arabs. But the very presence of a Jewish homeland
would, Arabs insisted, infringe on those rights.</p><br>
<a name="1937"></a>
<center><b><font size="+2"> 1937 - The Peel Commission </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
Since the Balfour Declaration of 1917 (which endorsed the idea of a Jewish
state within Palestine), the British government had been struggling to
reconcile the conflicting aspirations of Jews and Arabs in Palestine, which
Britain administered under a League of Nations mandate . Those who still
believed in the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two groups
got a grim comeuppance in July 1937 when the Peel Commission, headed by
Lord Robert Peel, issued its report. Basically, the commission concluded,
the mandate in Palestine was unworkable There was no hope of any
cooperative national entity there that included both Arabs and Jews, . The
impetus for the commission's formation had been the most recent spark of
Palestinian violence.Riots and Arab protests against the Jews in Palestine
had been escalating throughout the 1920s and '30s. In the mid-1930s, in
response to the thousands of Jews who'd arrived from Europe, Palestinian
Arabs formed the Arab High Committee to defend themselves against what they
perceived as a Jewish takeover A general strike exploded into a revolt.
Desperate for a solution, the British appointed Lord Peel to study the
situation. The Arab leadership boycotted the study.<br><br>
After dismissing the possibility of Arab-Jewish amity, the commission went
on to recommend the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab
state, and a neutral sacred site state to be administered by Britain.
Within two years, Britain found itself in a no-win situation, and on the
eve of World War II issued the infamous "White Paper" severely curtailing
Jewish immigration into Palestine. </p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1947 - Great britain withdraw & the UN partition plan </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
Exhausted by seven years of war and eager to withdraw from overseas
colonial commitments, Great Britain in 1947 decided to leave Palestine and
called on the United Nations (UN) to make recommendations. In response, the
UN convened its first special session in 1947, and on November 29, 1947, it
adopted a plan calling for partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab
states, with Jerusalem as an international zone under UN jurisdiction; the
Jewish and Arab states would be joined in an economic union. The partition
resolution was endorsed by a vote of 33 to 13, supported by the United
States and the Soviet Union. The British abstained. </p><br>
<a name="19481"></a>
<center><b><font size="+2"> 1948 - First Arab-Israeli War </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
In Palestine, Arab protests against partition erupted in violence, with
attacks on Jewish settlements in retaliation to the attacks of Jews
terrorist groups to Arab Towns and villages and massacres in hundred
against unarmed Palestinian in there homes , that soon led to a full-scale
war. The British generally refused to intervene, intent on leaving the
country no later than August 15, 1948, the date in the partition plan for
termination of the mandate.<br><br>
When it became clear that the British intended to leave by May 15, leaders
of the Yishuv decided (as they claim) to implement that part of the
partition plan calling for establishment of a Jewish state. In Tel Aviv on
May 14 the Provisional State Council, formerly the National Council,
“representing the Jewish people in Palestine and the World Zionist
Movement,” proclaimed the “establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine,
to be called Medinat Israel (the State of Israel) … open to the immigration
of Jews from all the countries of their dispersion.”<br><br>
On May 15 the armies of Egypt, Transjordan (now Jordan), Syria, Lebanon,
and Iraq joined Palestinian and other Arab guerrillas who had been fighting
Jewish forces since November 1947. The war now became an international
conflict, the first Arab-Israeli War. The Arabs failed to prevent
establishment of a Jewish state, and the war ended with four UN-arranged
armistice agreements between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria.
The frontiers defined in the armistice agreements remained until they were
altered by Israel's conquests during the Six Days War in 1967. </p><br>
<a name="19482"></a>
<center><b><font size="+2"> 1948 - Israel founded </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
The population balance in the new state of Israel was drastically altered
during the 1948 war. The armistice agreements extended the territory under
Israel's control beyond the UN partition boundaries from approximately
15,500 to 20,700 sq km (about 6,000 to 8,000 sq mi). The small Gaza Strip
on the Egypt-Israel border was left under Egyptian control, and the West
Bank was controled by Jordan . Of the more than 800,000 Arabs who lived in
Israeli held territory before 1948, only about 170,000 remained. The rest
became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries, ending the Arab majority
in the Jewish state.<br><br>
Israel's Provisional State Council organized elections for the first
Knesset (parliament) in 1949. Chaim Weizmann, the most prominent Zionist
leader of the prewar period, became the country's first president.</p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1954 - Nasser Takes Charges </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
For almost two years, Colonel Gamal Abdal Nasser had quietly directed
Egypt's revolution-from-above, while General Muhammad Naguib served as
president and prime minister. In February 1954, the colonel stepped to the
fore. Citing Naguib's ties to the banned Muslim Brotherhood and his
intention to restore the old system of government, Nasser forced him to
resign. In April, Nasser took over the premiership. </p><br>
<a name="1956"></a>
<center><b><font size="+2"> 1956 - The Suez campaign </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
Attempts to convert the Israeli-Arab armistice agreements into peace
treaties were unsuccessful. The Arabs insisted that the refugees be
permitted to return to their homes, that Jerusalem be internationalized,
and that Israel make territorial concessions before they entered peace
talks. Israel charged that these demands would undermine its security and
refused them. Frequent incursions by refugee guerrilla bands and attacks by
Arab military units were made, which Israel answered with forceful
retaliation. Egypt refused to permit Israeli ships to use the Suez Canal
and blockaded the Straits of Tiran (Israel's access to the Red Sea), which
was seen as an act of war. Border incidents along the frontiers with Egypt
escalated until they erupted in the second Arab-Israeli War in October and
November of 1956.<br><br>
Great Britain and France ostensibly joined the attack because of their
dispute with Egypt's president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just
nationalized the Suez Canal. Nasser took over the canal after Great Britain
and France withdrew offers to finance the construction of the Aswan High
Dam. Israel scored a quick victory, seizing the Gaza Strip and the Sinai
Peninsula within a few days. As Israeli forces reached the banks of the
Suez Canal, the British and French started their attack. The fighting was
halted by the UN after a few days, and a UN Emergency Force (UNEF) was sent
to supervise the cease-fire in the Canal zone. In a rare instance of
cooperation, the United States and the Soviet Union supported the UN
resolution forcing the three invading countries to leave Egypt and Gaza. By
the end of the year their forces withdrew from Egypt, but Israel refused to
leave Gaza until early 1957, and only after the United States had promised
to help resolve the conflict and keep the Straits of Tiran open. </p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1958 - Arabs Unite </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
The 1958 merger of Syria and Egypt into the United Arab Republic was the
first of a series of dramatic realignments throughout the Middle East,
inspired by the vision of Gamal Abdal Nasser. Syria had been moving in the
Egyptian dictator's ideological direction since the fall of a rightist
military regime in 1954: the new junta, dominated by the socialist Ba'ath
party, had followed Egypt in recognizing Mao's China and acquiring Soviet
arms, Squeezed between Washington (which backed anti Soviet Arab
governments against their nonaligned neighbors) and a growing domestic
Communist movement, Syria's leaders decided to put their pan-Arabist
notions to the test. National borders, after all, were a Western invention:
Syria would lose nothing and gain untold strength by melding with dynamic
Egypt. More changes followed quickly. Yemen, though ruled by a conservative
monarch, sought security by affiliating itself with the U.A.R. in a
confederation called the United Arab States, The Western-oriented kingdoms
of Iraq and Jordan formed a rival union. In Saudi Arabia, King Saud was
forced to cede authority to his relatively pro-Egyptian brother Faisal
after being implicated in a plot on Nasser's life. In Lebanon, civil war
erupted between Syrian-backed Arab nationalists and supporters of
pro-Western president Camille Chamoun. In Iraq, when Premier Nuri al-Said
decided to aid Chamoun, pro-Egyptian officers revolted killing Said along
with King Faisal II and most of the royal family. The Iraqi-Jordanian
federation was no more.<br><br>
Fearing the spread of Nasserism to Lebanon, the United States sent 10,000
troops and sponsored talks between the warring factions. A compromise led
to elections, and General Fuad Chehab less enthusiastically pro-Western and
friendlier to Nasser than Chamoun became president.<br><br>
Except for Jordan, all the Arab nations had now fallen more or less into
Cairo's camp. But they soon fell out again. Iraq's strongman, Abdul Karim
Kassem, developed a bitter personal rivalry with his Egyptian counterpart .
The Syrians came to resent Nasser's authoritarianism, while the Saudis and
Yemenites resisted his socialism. And by 1961, when Syria seceded from the
U.A.R. , Arab unity lay in ruins. </p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1967 - The Six Days War </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
After the Suez-Sinai war Arab nationalism increased dramatically, as did
demands for revenge led by Egypt's president Nasser. The formation of a
united Arab military command that massed troops along the borders, together
with Egypt's closing of the Straits of Tiran and Nasser's insistence in
1967 that the UNEF leave Egypt, led Israel to attack Egypt, Jordan, and
Syria simultaneously on June 5 of that year.<br><br>
The war ended six days later with an Israeli victory. Israel's
French-equipped air force wiped out the air power of its antagonists and
was the chief instrument in the destruction of the Arab armies.<br><br>
The Six Days War left Israel in possession of Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula,
which it took from Egypt; Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which it
took from Jordan; and the Golan Heights, taken from Syria. Land under
Israel's jurisdiction after the 1967 war was about four times the size of
the area within its 1949 armistice frontiers. The occupied territories
included an Arab population of about 1.5 million.<br><br>
The occupied territories became a major political issue in Israel after
1967. The right and leaders of the country's orthodox religious parties
opposed withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, which they considered part
of Israel. In the Labor Alignment, opinion was divided; some Laborites
favored outright annexation of the occupied territories, others favored
withdrawal, and some advocated retaining only those areas vital to Israel's
military security. Several smaller parties, including the Communists, also
opposed annexation. The majority of Israelis, however, supported the
annexation of East Jerusalem and its unification with the Jewish sectors of
the city, and the Labor-led government formally united both parts of
Jerusalem a few days after the 1967 war ended. In 1980 the Knesset passed
another law, declaring Jerusalem “complete and united,” Israel's eternal
capital.<br><br>
The 1967 war was followed by an upsurge of Palestinian Arab nationalism.
Several guerrilla organizations within the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) carried out guerrillas attacks on Israeli targets, with
the stated objective of “redeeming Palestine.” Guerrillas attacks on
Israelis targets at home and abroad unified public opinion against
recognition of and negotiation with the PLO, but the group nevertheless
succeeded in gaining widespread international support, including UN
recognition as the “sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians.”</p><br>

The stunning performances of the young Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut and the
gold medals of American swimmer Mark Spitz and British athlete Mary Peters
could not dispel the horror in Munich when the 20th Olympic Games became
the setting for an guerrilla attacked which left 11 Israeli athletes dead.
The attacked began just before dawn on September 5th when eight hooded
guerrillas scaled the fence around the Olympic Village. Bursting into the
dormitory where the 11 Israeli athletes were sleeping, they shot two dead
and took the other nine hostage, threatening to kill them unless 200 Arab
guerrillas were released. The German authorities agreed to take the
guerrillas to Furstentbldbruck military airfield where a Lufthansa airliner
was waiting on the tarmac to fly them out of the country. There they were
ambushed by German marksmen, but in the ensuing gun battle all nine
hostages were killed in the cross-fire. </p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1973 - The October War </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
In 1973 Egypt joined Syria in a war on Israel to regain the territories
lost in 1967. The two Arab states struck unexpectedly on October 6, which
fell on Yom Kippur , Israel's holiest fast day . After crossing the suez
channel the Arab forces gain a lot of advanced positions in Sinai Peninsula
and Golan Heights and manage to defeat the Israeli forces for more then
three weeks . Israeli forces with a massive U.S. economic and military
assistance managed to stop the arab forces after a three-week struggle and
defeat with the cost of many casualties,and the Arabs strong showing won
them support from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and most
of the world's developing countries. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait financed the
Arab forces, making it possible for Egypt and Syria to receive the most
sophisticated Soviet weapons , and the Arab oil producing states cut off
petroleum exports to the United States and other Western nations in
retaliation for their aid to Israel.<br><br>
Israel, forced to compete with the nearly unlimited Arab resources, was
faced with a serious financial setback. Only massive U.S. economic and
military assistance enabled it to redress the balance, but even American
aid was unable to prevent a downward spiral of the economy.<br><br>
In an effort to encourage a peace settlement, U.S. President Richard M.
Nixon charged his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, with the task of
negotiating agreements between Israel and Egypt and Syria. Kissinger
managed to work out military disengagements between Israel and Egypt in the
Sinai and between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights during 1974.</p><br>

<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
Begin, however, was the first Israeli leader to achieve a peace settlement
with an Arab state. It resulted from the surprise initiative of President
Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt, who in November 1977 flew to Jerusalem, where he
addressed the Knesset and called on Begin to begin peace talks. After
protracted negotiations sponsored by U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Camp
David, Maryland, the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was signed in
Washington, D.C., on March 26, 1979. Although the treaty ended the
prospects for war between Israel and Egypt, many issues remained between
the two countries, including the problem of arranging for Arab autonomy in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza. </p><br>

<center><b><font size="+2"> 1979 - Russian Jews </font></b></center>
<p align=justify style="margin-left : 3%; margin-right : 3%;">
The Jews of the Russian empire had been oppressed for centuries, and though
the pogroms ended under Soviet rule, discrimination did not. Fearing
international embarrassment and a "brain drain" of skilled workers, MOSCOW
had long restricted emigration. But in the 1970s, detente brought a
loosening of curbs. The exodus peaked in 1979 , when more then 51,000 exit
visas were issued.<br><br>
The sharp increase, coinciding with the conclusion of the second
U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) , was widely seen as
an attempt to influence treaty ratification. A second Soviet foreign policy
goal to achieve most favored nation status with the United States was
equally important: In 1979, U.S. officials were considering repeal of the
Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a 1974 law that tied trade grants to free
emigration.<br><br>
Even as emigration soared, the Kremlin cracked down on Jewish activism
reviling refuseniks (the term for those refused permission to leave) as
"agents of world Zionism" and sentencing many to long terms in labor camps
or psychiatric institutions. The 1977 arrest of Anatoly Shcharansky, a
young mathematician who'd talked openly with Western reporters about his
failure to gain an exit permit, generated international outrage. Charged
with spying for the CIA, Shcharansky was convicted in a closed trial, and
served nine years in prison before being released to Israel as part of a
spy exchange. His case was extraordinary only in the attention it drew.<br><br>
Watchdog groups estimated that by 1979, some 180,000 Soviet Jews had filed
for visas, yet emigration plummeted the following year, when SALT II failed
to be ratified and the Carter administration - reacting to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan - imposed a grain embargo. By 1984, the number of
emigres had slumped to 896. </p><br>

weapons. The President and seven others fell, mortally wounded. Sadat was
flown to the Maadi military hospital where he died an hour and 40 minutes
later. Sadat's funeral on October 10th was attended by only one Arab head
of state. He had isolated himself in the Arab world by the rapprochement
with Israel which had won him and Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in
1978 and led to a peace treaty between the two countries in 1979. Iraq,
Libya, Syria and the Palestinian Liberation Organization openly applauded
his assassination. </p><br>

Events in the Middle East took a surprising turn in 1993. After secret
negotiations, Prime Minister Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat flew to
Washington, D.C., and agreed to the signing of an historic peace agreement.
Israel agreed to allow for Palestinian self-rule, first in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank town of Jericho, and later in other areas of the West
Bank that are not settled by Jews.<br><br>
In Sept,93 , At a ceremony in Washington, D.C., representatives of Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed an agreement
designed to end 45 years of confrontation between the Israelis and
Palestinians. The actual signing was done by Israel's foreign minister,
Shimon Peres, and PLO foreign policy spokesman, Mahmoud Abbas. Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and PLO leader Yasser Arafat met and shook
hands on the White House lawn, as President Bill Clinton of the United
States and 3,000 guests looked on. The agreement was limited in scope; it
provided for transfer of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to Palestinian rule
within a few months. But the accord was regarded as a first step in
resolving years of violent conflict between Jews and Palestinians. The
agreement had been worked out secretly in Oslo, Norway, with the mediation
of Norway's foreign minister, Johan Jorgen Holst. Following the signing, a
long process of negotiation began on the means of transferring power in the
occupied lands. </p><br>

In May'94 , At a ceremony in Cairo, Egypt, attended by 2,500 guests, Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and
Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of Israel, signed the final version of the
Declaration of Principles that had been signed in Washington, D.C., on
Sept. 13, 1993. The accord was regarded as a start toward bringing peace
between Israelis and Palestinians after 45 years of conflict. Within 24
hours of the signing, Israeli military forces were scheduled to leave the
Gaza Strip and Jericho, ending 27 years of occupation of those territories.
A Palestinian police force was ready to move into the areas to keep order.
Among the foreign visitors at the ceremony were Secretary of State Warren
Christopher of the United States, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of
Russia, and Foreign Minister Koji Kazikawa of Japan. In spite of the
accord, Jewish and Palestinian extremists in Israel vowed to prevent its
full implementation. </p><br>

In July 1994 Prime Minister Mr. Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan signed a
peace agreement ending 46 years of war and strained relations. The
agreement, which was signed at the White House in the presence of U.S.
President Bill Clinton, laid the groundwork for a full peace treaty.</p><br>

In Sept. 24 , Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) officials
meeting in Taba, Egypt, finalized agreement on the second stage of eventual
Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian lands. Under the pact, which was
officially signed on September 28 in Washington, D.C., Israeli forces were
scheduled to be removed from six Arab cities and 400 villages in the West
Bank by early 1996, after which elections would be held for a 82-member
Palestinian council, which would possess legislative and executive power in
the West Bank and Gaza.<br><br>
Special arrangements were agreed upon for the West Bank city of Hebron,
where Israeli soldiers will remain to protect the 450 Jewish settlers
living there. Disagreement over the status of Hebron almost scuttled the
agreement, and it took almost a week of non-stop negotiations between PLO
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to resolve
the issue.<br><br>
The pact was the second stage in a three-step process agreed upon in the
Declaration of Principles, a framework for eventual Palestinian autonomy
signed by the PLO and Israel in September 1993. The first phase in the
process was finalized in May 1994, when an accord was signed in Cairo,
Egypt, for the pullout of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank town of Jericho and the handing over of administrative duties to the
Palestinian National Authority, led by Arafat. The third stage will tackle
such contentious issues as the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Israeli
settlers, and the final borders between Israel and the Palestinian state
that many analysts believe is close to becoming a reality. Negotiations
concerning the last phase of the peace process were scheduled to begin in
May 1996, with any agreement to be implemented before the end of the
century. </p><br>

In Nov.4 , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated in Tel
Aviv by a right-wing extremist who considered Rabin's crusade for peace a
betrayal of the Jewish state. The prime minister was shot three times as he
was getting into his car to leave a peace rally at 9:30 PM local time. He
was rushed to nearby Ichilov Hospital but had no heartbeat or blood
pressure when admitted to the emergency room. Doctors tried without success
to revive Rabin, but he was pronounced dead at 11:10 PM. Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres took over leadership of the Labor government upon
Rabin's death. </p><br>
