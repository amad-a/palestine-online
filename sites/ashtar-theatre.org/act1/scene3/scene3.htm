<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Articles on ASHTAR and reviews of our Productions</H3>

<P>In the following pages we have collected excerpts from newspapers, magazines
and other publications about our theatre work. You’ll find reviews of our
productions are mixed in with reports on our successes in festivals and
more general information on ASHTAR. We know this makes it more difficult
to go straight to something about a particular production, but don’t blame
us, we just copied it. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In a downtown community center created from the
refurbished Al-Siraj movie house. Another step forward in Palestinian society
is taking shape. A rehearsal is under way for a production later this evening
of &quot;<I>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</I>&quot; to be performed in Arabic
by the Ashtar theater group. The actors are a mix of older, experienced
performers and energetic younger novices: a sparse set of branches and
trellises evokes the Athenian countryside in which the fantasy romance
is set. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This production is charged by the vision of the
small group of dramatic artists trying to fulfill a ambitious dream of
their own. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;<B>What we are trying to create.&quot; </B>says
Ashtar co-director Iman Aoun. &quot; i<B>s a Palestinian theatrical tradition</B>.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Palestinian theater itself not a new phenomenon
: during the 1970’s and 80’s a number of small drama companies sprang up
in East Jerusalem, performing sporadically here and there, and on rare
occasions, in the West Bank and Gaza. The most accomplished of these groups
was the Al-Hakawati, which frequently staged original productions dealing
with the Palestinian political struggle. Two regular performers of the
troupe were Aoun and her husband Edward Muallem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;T<B>here was no theater education available
in the Palestinian sector itself..&quot;</B>, she notes, &quot;i<B>ncluding
in any of the West Bank universities. So the only options for Palestinians
were to learn in an Israeli environment or to go abroad to study, something
very few had the opportunity to do.&quot; </B></FONT></P>

students were a bit suspicious at first. &quot;<B>There is little theatrical
tradition in our community.&quot; </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;<B>Many of the girls who started with us
faced pressure from their families and had to drop out. The parents were
also reluctant to let their daughters go out to rehearsals at night and
to take part in an activity in which they would be mingling with the opposite
sex.&quot; </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But those who stayed have grown in poise and confidence
- reveling in the strong, intelligent role models for women offered by
some of the plays. Adds Iman Aoun,&quot;<B>our female students develop
a strong personality and don’t meekly submit to the decisions made by their
families regarding their future. Through theater they learn how to identify
their needs because the real struggle starts with oneself.</B>&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">FRIDAY,MAY 5, 1995 Toward Stagecraft The staff
of the Ashtar School for Theater Education has had to overcome social inhibitions
in its quest to bring a new level of professionalism to the palestinian
stage. Now Ashtar has become a training ground for future actors and professionals
in Palestinian theater. But the change wasn’t easy. &quot; <B>First we
had to establish that there was a need for theater, </B>&quot; says Aoun.
Like many on the Ashtar teaching team, Aoun is a former member of the El-Hakawati
Theater Company, which was a central part of a Palestinian cultural awakening
in the late 1970s and `80s. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot; <B>We were creating a new approach to theater
with Ashtar. The majority of Palestinian actors learn acting by (performing)
and there has always been a lack of `professionals` who really know the
profession and what it needs. Slowly Palestinian theater is growing and
by studying and teaching theater, we can accelerate the process and create
a new generation of Palestinian theater actors.</B>&quot; Until now what
has been important in Palestinian theater has been the words, says drama
coach Hijazi, who studied art and theater production at Leipzig’s High
Institute for Theater Art. Now, he says, the students want body language
to be a part of it, too. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;<B>Maybe some of the established actors
will get mad when they see what the new generation can do,</B>&quot; he
says. </FONT></P>
