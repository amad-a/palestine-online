<P>Arnab Arnab ..... Do You Read ME? was our second summer production.
Following the success of the previous summer’s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;,
<B>the summer production had become a tradition</B> and this year we took
it even further, becoming the largest production ever to be staged by a
Palestinian theatre company. Also, of its <B>17 players, 11 were young
women</B>. </P>

<P>As the year before, professional actors and designers were an integral
part of the team, giving the students the chance to experience working
skilled artists on the creation, and performance, of a theatre piece. </P>

<P><B>The play is the story of a regular family, all be it with a rather
unusual son, Arnab, who is convinced that he was sent from another planet,
and even receives a ‘visitor’ - whom only he can see. Early one morning
the doorbell rings, unfolding a chain of events, including the disappearance
of Arnab, that threaten their very foundations, bringing the family to
the verge of collapse: </B></P>

<P><B>With nothing more to lose, the family decide to liberate their imprisoned
son. In the bizarre rescue, desperation turns to hope when Arnab reappears
to work his magic: In one fell swoop he turns all the soldiers into women.

<TD><TT>Instead of repeating the &quot;open-stage&quot; approach we took
with the previous year’s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, we chose to
adopt a Brechtian style for &quot;Arnab..&quot;. Both because we wanted
to give our trainees practice in playing with props as well as space, and,
because we wanted to depict the harsh reality of the living conditions
of the average Palestinian family. We had as many as 14 actors on stage
at a time, forcing them to live, and act, on top of one another!</TT></TD>

<P>The play seeks a new logic, one that challenges what we call reality.
For both the actors and the audience, the designing, searching and sharing
of the creative process, helps to form the new logic that &quot; <B>Arnab
Arnab ..... Do You Read ME</B>?&quot;, asks for. </P>
