<P>For our first production with our students we wanted to stage something
that would be a challenging learning experience, not only in terms of the
ideals of the story, but also in their exposure to a professional environment;
Edward Muallem, professional actor and co-founder of Ashtar, played the
role of the father, the Beast was also played by a professional.<BR>

<TD colspan=2><TT>The curtains were strong earthy colours.<BR>
They were arranged to have width and depth<BR>
-they represented the external forest, where the father was lost, and the
wilderness of the mind, where each of us wanders in search of our own beauty
or beast.</TT></TD>

<TD colspan=2><TT>The Beast is not even vaguely human in front.<BR>
In the Beast's palace the gates are open. They are adorned with folwers
( his rose garden ), their pretty colours starkly contrast with the ugliness
of the Beast. The blue is reminiscent of the sky, yet the gilding, for
all its ornateness, reminds us that he is still a prisoner.</TT></TD>

<TD colspan=2><TT>The same rug upside-down covers the floor of Beauty's
home. The same gates closed become its walls. Hinting that that on another
level, the story transcends physical placement, being more of a journey
into self.</TT></TD>

<TD colspan=2><TT>In this way his appearance contrasts with those other
real beasts, (the sisters and their finances), who seem to occupy the human
realm unopposed. Secondly, his exterior disability parallels the way in
which, internally, he has condemned himself.</TT></TD>

</TABLE>

<P>We decided to do &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, because we wanted
to present a colourful and lively piece of theatre that opened a window
to joy and beauty, with straightforward yet relevant themes. <B>Society’s
attitude to beauty / disfigurement </B>is a big issue here, aesthetically
and philosophically. </P>

<CENTER><P>It is comprehensive yet difficult play, not because it is mysterious
but because its message is transparent. <B>The opposite of shouting in
a world full of aggression.</B> </P></CENTER>
