<P>At ASHTAR everyone is both an educator and a learner. Right from the
start we encourage our trainees to be creative and critical, getting them
used to the idea that learning is a two-way process. Even long-in-the-tooth
professionals benefit from sharing, working and playing with trainees -
their objectivity , their questions and interpretations help to keep us
fresh. But it doesn’t stop there. At every level we strive to involve the
Palestinian community: </P>

<P>1. <B><U>We work with youth in their high-schools, universities, summer-
camps and beyond.</U></B> Since the outbreak of the Intifada, closures
have continually disrupted the school system. With only limited time, schools
have shed artistic or creative programs as being ‘unnecessary’ or ‘superfluous’
( ! ) Need we say more ? </P>

<P>2. <B><U>Through productions in our studio and on tour.</U></B> We have
our school program but we also try to communicate with those for whom a
school program came too late. ( If indeed they ever got the opportunity
to go to school in the first place). We hold performances in our own studios
in Ramallah but as often as not, to get our message across, we have to
take the mountain to Mohammed. Armed with little more than a <B>couple
of trunks, false eyelashes and a smile</B>, we have performed at venues
as diverse as open forests, class rooms and wedding halls ( mirrored ceilings
included). We have toured around the Middle East and farther afield, carrying
our message to others and providing an alternative outlet for <B>Palestinians
to vent their feelings of frustration</B> within their own society and
at their situation. </P>

<P>3. <B><U>Through organisation of and participation in festivals and
cultural events</U></B>. We want to create a vibrant and meaningful theatre
tradition in Palestine and use it to raise awareness of the economic, social
and political issues that beset our country at this time. We are dedicated
to bringing our messages and challenges to the forefront of people’s mind
- both within Palestine and on a world stage. </P>

<P>4. <B><U>Working with Others....</U></B> In an unstable and uncertain
country in particular, people need solid things to focus on. Until we established
the ASHTAR Studio, there were <B>very few permanent venues for the Arts,</B>
nowhere for the young people to come and experiment in safety. And, no
fixed addresses for the rest of the world to find us. Now that we have
the studio, <B>we have a new focus for the local community,</B> the local
arts scene and international attention too. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#E74523"><B>A. The National Scene - Theatre as a family
member of the arts movement in Palestine<BR>
</B>In case you didn’t know already, Palestine is a pretty small country,
and the Arts scene within it is, to put it kindly, somewhat smaller than
that! Therefore, it becomes vital that we stick together, exchanging our
ideas, and <B>sharing our appreciation and belief in Art as a valid form
of free expression.</B> Dance groups, music groups, artistic bodies and
centres, NGOs, old / ex students and friends of ASHTAR, we all encourage
and support each other in what we do. </FONT></P>

</B>In 1995 a group of theatre people from the community founded the <B>Palestinian
Centre of the International Institute of the Theatre of the Mediterranean</B>.
( Because they like long titles). ASHTAR acts as a mediator and host for
this group of 21 countries around the Mediterranean who come together in
order to promote and develop the expression of Mediterranean visual culture.
And, encourage initiatives of cultural and theatrical exchange through
research, creation, publication, co-operation and co-productions .....
basically anything that develops its objectives. </FONT></P>

them. </FONT></P>
