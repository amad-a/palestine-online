<P><B>History of the idea</B></P>

<P>It was the natural growth, and the graduation of our first Drama group,
that made us add this new step to our Drama program. At its beginning the
new program had two main aims: </P>

<P><B>To give the graduates advanced acting skills, and integrate them
into professional work. </B></P>

<P><B>To create a pool of well trained actors and drama teachers who would
be able to transfer their knowledge practically to others.</B></P>

<P>In the summer of 1996, The Palestinian Curriculum Development Centre
in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and sponsored by UNESCO,
commissioned a group of artists to work on drawing the different domains
of the Arts into the Palestinian School Curriculum. Iman Aoun was commissioned
to work on the Drama and Theatre part of the program. The DTT program was
therfore looked upon as one answer to the growing need for Drama Teachers
in schools. </P>

<P>At the end of that year, we added another layer / dimension to our program
- to lead the trainees themselves straight to becoming Drama Teacher’s
Trainers, they would then be able to work with the current teachers, and
train them to become Drama Teachers. </P>

<P><B>What we did last year</B></P>

<P>In November 1996, we formed a group of 6 teachers from different schools
in Ramallah, and worked with them for 40 hours, in a pilot program within
the new DTT approach. At the same time, our DTT trainees were given new
methods in working with these school teachers, that would enable them to
transfer their knowledge in ‘drama teaching’ to these teachers. Peter Braschler,
Swiss specialist trainer, led the workshop. The Subjects covered included:
Basic Body Training; Group Leading; Tackling Difficult Circumstances (
i.e. lack of money, time ...); lots of theatre games. Each teacher was
asked to train a group of students back in their schools - during and after
the workshop - and do two plays a year with them. The teachers’ work is
supervised by the DTT trainers. The group gathers 2 or 3 times a year for
feedback. </P>

<P><B>This year’s plan </B></P>

<P>This year is an upside-down version of last year! Well the second half,
at least. It breaks down like this: </P>

<P>a: Peter Braschler, assembles the school teachers and the DTT trainees
for a period of revision and feedback on last year’s work. Then the trainees
are given extra skills work development and introduced to some new techniques
(which they will impart to the teachers in-school). </P>

<P>b: Later the DTT trainees go into the schools, but, unlike last year,
(when they were assistants to the teachers), this time they take charge
in working directly with students, with the teachers on hand to assist
and follow the new techniques that the trainees learned from Peter. </P>

<P>Weekly, the DTT trainees meet at the Studio with Sameh, the joint director
of the program - for guidance and to share experiences. </P>--></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Drama Teachers' Training</H2>

<P>We are into the second year of this two-year course, which aims at creating
a pool of drama teachers, and their trainers, for Palestinian high-schools.
In doing so, we are replacing our own direct involvement in-school, creating
job opportunities for our trainees and helping to improve the standard
and availability drama teaching in this country and beyond. It is the first
program of its kind in Palestine, and has generated great involvement and
interest from the whole community. There is a run down of the curriculum
of this program and our evaluation of it so far in &quot;<A HREF="../../act3/scene11.htm#dtt">Walking
in our Footsteps&quot; </A></P>
