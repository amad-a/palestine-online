<B><FONT SIZE=+2>&quot;Martyrs Are Coming Back......To Tour!&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P>Following the recent success of our latest production, both within Palestine
and at the 8th Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theatre (where
we received two awards, &quot;Best Actress&quot;: Iman Auon and &quot;Most
Distinguished Arab Play&quot; ), we are now going on the road..... </P>

<P>&quot;<B>Martyrs are Coming Back...&quot;</B>, is a play written by
our very own Sameh Hijazi, based on his interpretation of the Algerian
writer, At-Taher Wattar’s, novel of the same name. </P>

<P>Sameh took the <B>theological paradox of a Martyr</B> and juxtaposed
it with the particular problems he sees in Palestinian society, particularly
the tradition against a female vision. In this sense the play is highly
topical but we have approached it in an artistic, rather than overtly political
way. </P>

<P>It concerns the vision of Um El Izz, the mother of a martyr, and society’s
denial of her vision (that the martyrs will be coming back), and dismissal
of her as a women. </P>
