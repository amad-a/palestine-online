<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Three Day Seminar 9th, 10th and 11th
January, 1998. </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The headlong rush of political change in Palestine since the &quot;Peace
Treaty&quot;, has affected primary domains in our society. And, although
many changes have had negative ramifications others such as <B>Ministry
of Culture</B> and the <B>attitude toward theatre in education,</B> have
been positive.</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Reason for the Seminar
</FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>During our first six years, we have been concentrating our efforts on
teaching drama directly to the high school students as an extra-curricular
activity. Our efforts have been highly rewarded. We have succeeded in building
a strong reputation for our work. For this reason we feel that the time
has come to take the next step. To offer people the chance to devote themselves
to a full- time course of study: </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;A two year Diploma in Acting for post
high-school students&quot; </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>This will be the first attempt of its kind in Palestine, we hope it
will become one of the pillars of theatre training in our country, based
on international standards, yet keeping its national essence. To design
the program we need to discuss the new methods, the successes ( and the
failures !) that you, and we, have experienced. </P>

<P><B><U>The Composition of our Seminar:<BR>
</U>Our Four Main Aims </B></P>

<P><B>A. To draw benefit from the educational and practical experiences
of the participants. <BR>
B. To get exposure to what is new or developed in the world of teaching
acting. <BR>
C. To research various peculiarities vis-à-vis the generalities in teaching
theatre. <BR>
D. To find ways of future cooperation between ASHTAR and the participants.
</B></P>

<P><B>Each day of the seminar we will focus our discussions on one of the
following points. </B></P>

<P><B>A. </B>In order to draw benefit from the experiences of the participants,
we need to discuss and share the original ideas and perspectives of those
who built their programs. Taking into consideration <B>the social, political
and cultural background to each program</B>, we will focus on how this
affected their design and content. </P>

<P><B>B.</B> We wish to learn about and share ideas on the curricula and
methods followed by the participants, whether within a school or individually.
We will focus on the <B>theoretical / practical ideas</B> used in the development
of each program - We will find out how each program was constructed and
implemented. Then through analysis we will examine the reasons for its
successes or failures. </P>

<P><B>C.</B> We are interested in discussing and <B>comparing the established
canon of techniques</B> and practices in Theatre (such as the methods of
Brecht or Stanislavsky). And, to compare these with <B>new techniques that
the participants have tried or developed. </B></P>

<P><B>We want to learn more about the peculiarities and idiosyncrasies
of theatre school courses </B>around the world. By examining the reasons
for these differences, we hope to be able to fit our program to the particular
needs of our learners, and at the same time provide them with <B>skills
and knowledge that translate universally.</B> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">We invite participants to prepare something on
one, or more of these subjects. </FONT></P>
