        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Palatia"><strong><u>El Funoun <a name="History">History<br>
        </a></u></strong></font>El-Funoun Palestinian Popular Dance Troupe
        was established in 1979 by a small number of
        enthusiastic, talented and committed artists. Since then,
        El-Funoun has been crowned as the lead Palestinian Dance
        Company . In Palestine, as well as among Palestinians in
        exile, El-Funoun has achieved an unprecedented popular
        recognition; in fact, quite a few of the Troupe's songs
        and dances have become household tunes.</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Palatia"><strong><u><a name="Aims">Aims
        </a>&amp; Vision<br>
        </u></strong></font>Since its inception, El-Funoun has aimed
        at expressing the spirit of Arab-Palestinian folklore and
        contemporary culture through unique combinations of
        traditional and stylized dance and music. The Troupe's
        repertoire comprises folkloric dance forms called
        &quot;Dabkeh&quot;, in addition to more elaborate
        choreographed forms that embody El Funoun's own unique
        vision of Palestinian Dance.</p>
        <p align="left">El-Funoun played a key-role in
        establishing the Popular Art Center, a community organization committed to raising awareness about the
        arts and opening opportunities for community members to
        participate in artistic activity and expression. The Center offers classes in traditional dance, ballet, Jazz
        music, puppets and drama, in addition to a host of other
        programs. Through the Center, El-Funoun's message has
        propagated to many schools, organizations and
        localities.</p>
        <p align="left">El-Funoun believes in building cultural
        bridges with the world, both to have a healthy exchange
        of experience, ideas and techniques and to present the
        long-suppressed Palestinian culture before other nations.</p>
        <p align="left">El-Funoun is widely recognized as the
        cultural entity that has played the most significant role
        in reviving and reinvigorating Palestinian dance and
        music folklore. This accomplishment is particularly
        important, since it effectively countered the systematic
        attempts by the Israeli occupation to suppress the
        Palestinian national identity through banning or
        expropriating any forms of Palestinian cultural
        expression. </p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Palatia"><strong><u><a name="Personnel">Personnel<br>
        </a></u></strong></font>El-Funoun is composed of fifty dancers,
        singers, musicians and support personnel. It is an
        independent, non-profit organization that is virtually
        entirely volunteer-based. The members are therefore
        motivated by the vision of the Troupe more than by any
        other factor. This not only keeps the Troupe's
        administrative cost quite low, but also ensures a strong
        sense of belonging to and ownership of the group. This
        resolve coupled with a driving commitment to artistic
        excellence and to authentic Palestinian art afforded El-Funoun its current leading position.</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Palatia"><strong><u><a name="Performances">Performances<br>

        in Palestine International Festivals of 1992 through
