        <p align="left">Rim Banna is a Palestinian singer born in
        the City of Nazareth in Galilee. She loved music and
        singing ever since she was a child. She participated in
        Festivals commemorating Land Day (30th of March) as well as in
        national and political occasions. She also participated
        in celebrations at schools. </p>
        <p align="left">Rim started her artistic life when she
        was 10 years old. She studied music and singing at the
        Higher Music Conservatory (GNESINS) in Moscow. She
        specialized in modern singing and in leading vocal
        ensembles. She finished the 6-year academic studies and
        graduated in 1991. During this time, Rim produced two
        albums of live recordings: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p align="left">Jafra Album in 1985 </p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">&quot;Your Tears, O Mother&quot;
                Album in 1986 </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">In 1991 Rim married the musician Leonid
        Alexeyenko from Ukraine. Leonid studied Music and Singing
        together with Rim at the Higher Music Conservatory in
        Moscow, where they worked together in music and
        composing. Currently, they live in the Arab City of
        Nazareth, the Capitol of the Galilee.</p>
        <p align="left">Rim Banna's songs are unique first and
        foremost because she composes most of her songs. She has
        a special musical method in composing and singing her
        songs. Her songs are inspired from the heart of the
        Palestinian People, from its heritage, its history and
        culture. Her singing and music are also inspired by the
        rhythms of the desert in the south, by the sea along the
        long Palestinian coastline, by the beautiful nature and
        its lovely colors of the flatland and the hills, by the
        echo between the mountains and the valleys, by the beat
        of the ancient Canaanite hymns which imitated the sound
        of the pure water emerging from between the rocks and the
        singing of the birds in the fields, that do not migrate
        but stand steadfast just like the blessed olive tree and
        the stubborn cacti which fill the land of Palestine.</p>
        <p align="left">The music and the melodies are inspired
        by the solidity of the lyric and from a profound feeling
        of the rhythm of the word. The intermarriage between word
        and tune take us from the skies of Palestine into the
        whole world. Her songs express the suffering of the
        Palestinian People, its dreams and obsessions, its joys,
        its sadness and its hopes.</p>
        <p align="left">The lyrics of the songs are by famous
        Palestinian poets: Tawfiq Zayyad, Mahmoud Darwish, Samih
        Al Qasim, Zuhaira Sabbagh, Sidi Harkash and some songs
        are written by Rim Banna herself. The two artists, Rim
        Banna and Leonid participate in composing the tunes in a
        creative and unique way.</p>
        <p align="left">Rim Banna's specialty is the Palestinian
        genre: Tahalil: which are children's bedtime songs. These
        have been imprisoned inside rooms and tied to the manjors
        until Rim sang them and presented them to the audience
        all over the world. Rim is still the only singer who
        presents Tahalil.</p>
        <p align="left">Rim sang several songs for children which
        she wrote and composed herself. These songs became widely
        popular among children especially when presented at
        Children's Festivals such as Nawwar Nisan Festival, Farah
        and Marah Festival, Jericho Winter Festival and Martyrs'
        Children Festival.</p>
        <p align="left">Rim Banna and Leonid present the
        Palestinian traditional song in a modern way both
        musically and in terms of its performance without
        destroying the essence of the tune or the beauty of the
        lyric. Together with her husband, Rim composes music for
        Palestinian popular lyrics such as popular stories, games
        and seasons songs. They compose music for these lyrics,
        which is inspired from Palestinian popular music, ancient
        Arabic music and also from international music of
        different nations. Rim Banna's songs posses a rare
        continuity from generation to generation which maintains
        the Great Heritage of Authentic Popular Art which is
        rooted deeply and fortifies National belonging.</p>
