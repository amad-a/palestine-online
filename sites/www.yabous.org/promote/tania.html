          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-kashida: 0%" align="left">Mrs.
          Tania Tamari Nasser was born in Jerusalem.&nbsp; She started singing
          ever since she was a child.&nbsp; Her activities focused on classical
          singing, where she was the soloist of community choir in Ramallah,
          Jerusalem and Amman.&nbsp; At the time, she sang special compositions
          by Mrs. Rima Nasser Tarazi and Amin Nasser, using lyrics by famous
          Arab poets such as Mahmoud Darwish, Kamal Nasir, Omar Abu Reesha,
          Samih Al Qasem, Ms. Fadwa Tuqan and others.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-kashida: 0%" align="left">In
          1992, Tania participated with Patrick Lama, a Palestinian composer
          living in Paris, in a concert of his compositions in Amman.&nbsp; She
          sang, accompanied by Lama, Lama's first vocal composition:&nbsp;
          &quot;The River of Death&quot; a song based on a poem by the Iraqi
          poet Badr Shakir Al Sayyab.&nbsp; In the same year, Tania joined the
          young Palestinian Tenor, Marwan Shamieh, in an &quot;Evening of
          Song&quot;, a concert of operatic arias and songs.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-kashida: 0%" align="left">At
          another event, Tania sang 3 songs by Agnes Bashir, a pianist and
          composer.&nbsp; The melodies were by Bashir and the lyrics by Jabra
          Ibrahim Jabra.&nbsp; Later, these three songs became the nucleus for a
          song cycle called &quot;The Miracle of Life&quot;.&nbsp; This cycle
          consisted of six songs based on poems by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra.&nbsp;
          The song cycle was performed on July 29, 1995 at a special concert at
          the Jerash Festival of Culture in Jerash, near Amman, Jordan, to pay
          tribute and honor to the memory of Jabra who had passed away on Dec.&nbsp;
          12, 1994.<o:p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-kashida: 0%" align="left">Although
          not a professional singer, Tania always seeks to cultivate her talent
          and enjoys the challenge of singing modern Arabic compositions.&nbsp;
          Tania says: &quot;I am always looking for what is new and innovative
          in Arabic singing.&nbsp; For although as a singer, I have been trained
          in the western classical tradition, I have always sought to express
          myself and identity through singing a special kind of song that
          combined my love for modern Arabic literature and classical music.&nbsp;
          I envision this song to be serious and intellectual in nature; where
          elements of our Arabic Culture blend and fuse to bring about a
          well-defined artistic identity that can find its place in an
          international contemporary culture.&quot;<o:p>

          Palestine-Dream of my people&quot; with lyrics and music by Rima Nasser
