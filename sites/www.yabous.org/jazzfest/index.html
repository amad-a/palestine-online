        Festival</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><a href="jazz99/index.html"><font size="3"

        <p align="left"><font size="2">Acclaimed Jazz Bassist
        Christian McBride says regarding Jazz &quot; Make no
        mistake, this music is for everyone Black, white, young,
        and old. Jazz is not an exclusive, elite club.&quot; At
        Yabous, not only do we believe in that but we also
        believe in the strong ties between Jazz and struggling
        nations. Jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim's music was part
        of the revolution against apartheid in South Africa. Jazz
        in the USA was part of the black man's struggle against
        slavery, just listen to Louis Armstrong singing &quot;
        Black and Blue&quot;. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Jazz is a free art form
        that emanates from the soul of the ordinary woman and man
        and that expresses the joys and tribulations of their
        everyday life . More and more these days, Jazz is being
        fused with ethnic music from all over the world to give
        us different genres of Jazz music all with different
        ethnic character while maintaining the basic Jazz form.
        Jazz has become so eclectic and multiethnic that we hear
        and sea the Middle-Eastern oud being played with the
        saxophone. The Latin marimba jazzing along with the
        double bass, and the banging of African djembe setting
        the rhythm for the Western European violin. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">Let us also not forget
        about the artists who have just as masterfully preserved
        the old art form of Jazz and still play as if they live
        in 1930s New Orleans.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">In Palestine, The First
        Jerusalem Jazz Festival 97 organized by Yabous
        Productions was attended by a large audience. Jazz is
        also slowly being introduced through small performances
        by international artists. On the radio, two of the
        largest Palestinian FM stations (Al- Manara 100.4 FM and
        Amwaj 91.5 FM) host 5 hours of Jazz programming per week
        in between them. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">We believe that bringing
        such vibrant, scintillating, and international Jazz to
        Palestine, through the proposed Jerusalem Jazz Festival
        will not only serve the goals aforementioned, but will
        also bring a high-caliber and very enjoyable event for
        everyone to relish.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2">In the future, we see The
        Jerusalem Festival for Jazz Music as an annual event that
        will continue to get bigger as the years go by hosting
        more groups and bigger names. With everyone's effort we
        believe that this is well within our reach.</font></p>
