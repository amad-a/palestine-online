There is a sleeping giant<BR>
Who goes by many names:<BR>
Avenger, Warrior, Punisher;<BR>
His greatest name is Servant.<BR>
His size is overwhelming,<BR>
His strength beyond a legend.<BR>
His purpose is to serve his<BR>
Many names: Morality and Truth;<BR>
Righteousness and Trust;<BR>
Compassion, Brotherhod and Family Love;<BR>
Honesty and Ethics;<BR>
Justice and Respect; Honor, Goodness,<BR>
And so many more;<BR>
The giant has been tricked<BR>
by corruption, lies, deceit,<BR>
Into falling deep into<BR>
A dreamless sleep.<BR>
But beware, whosoever of you<BR>
Bathe in evil, and prevail<BR>
Upon others to do great wrongs,<BR>
Beware!<BR>
Run and hide behind your trees,<BR>
For the giant, whose greatest name<BR>
Is Servant, is awakening,<BR>
And his roars of anger<BR>
Will crumble mountains.<BR>
