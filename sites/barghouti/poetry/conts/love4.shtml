<font size=+2>Love In Four Languages</font><BR> 
(from the Book of Translations)
<P>
a book of Kurdish melodies<BR> 
a book of Arabic proverbs<BR> 
a books of Turkish memories<BR> 
a book of English adorations<BR> 
<P>
Tonight<BR> 
come to me<BR> 
in a dream<BR> 
On this night<BR> 
we will be born into one<BR> 
from this dream<BR> 
Outwit the quickness<BR> 
of your thoughts<BR> 
that are unsure<BR> 
Outwit the alertness<BR> 
of my heart<BR> 
that is trembling<BR> 
Open softly<BR> 
the door of me<BR> 
Translate this love<BR> 
in all of your languages<BR> 
<P>
<b>I</b><BR> 
Kurdish<BR> 
I am watching the stars<BR> 
Whisper nothing, even less<BR> 
Shelter my eyes with your hands<BR> 
Open your rose petal lips<BR> 
drink the cream of my skin<BR> 
I am in exile<BR> 
Unable to eat or sleep, ecstatic<BR> 
in shrouds<BR> 
in ashes<BR> 
on the shore of a continent<BR> 
that carries your name<BR> 
<P>
<b>II</b><BR> 
Arabic<BR> 
The moon ascends<BR> 
Seven years the moon rose<BR> 
then fell as I waited<BR> 
at seven gates<BR> 
Pale as this night<BR> 
My heart lived shut<BR> 
like a pearl<BR> 
Trampled by war<BR> 
at the borders<BR> 
of sunrise and sunset<BR> 
Men were bees<BR> 
whose wings carreid honey<BR> 
swarming to nest<BR> 
before you<BR> 
<P>
<b>III</b><BR>
Turkish<BR>
I am listening to the Sea<BR> 
It is you<BR> 
that enters me<BR> 
without words <BR>
without mercy <BR>
Sharp as a knife <BR>
The steel of your fingers <BR>
crushes my bones into stars <BR>
Your cries are my cries <BR>
I fly <BR>
on the breath of your soul <BR>
on the scent of your skin <BR>
Swear as I do <BR>
we are clear, we are<BR> 
surrendering nothing <BR>
to all heaven and earh <BR>
Say- <BR>
you take <BR>
what is yours <BR>
<P>
<b>IV</b> <BR>
English <BR>
Constellations move <BR>
in your eyes, I pour <BR>
down your chest like soft rain <BR>
you shudder <BR>
under the fall of my fingertips <BR>
Columns of marble <BR>
Your thighs are veined with sapphire <BR>
My hands gather you <BR>
soldier, my king <BR>
you are here without words <BR>
or maps <BR>
at the mouth of the Nile <BR>
Your history is written <BR>
on the waves that dissolve <BR>
between my lips <BR>
You have slept in my blood <BR>
While I slept on a bed of fire <BR>
I am on the bridge to Damascus <BR>
I am beneath the Polar star <BR>
I am naked before Heaven <BR>
I am shameless, speechless, blind without limbs <BR>
in your arms <BR>
You call my name <BR>
I dissolve in a bed of tulips <BR>
Your hands pull out my life <BR>
You fill me with yours <BR>
I am ablaze <BR>
thirsting in a garden <BR>
that glistens with tears <BR>
You call my name <BR>
your tongue carries me water <BR>
I find you <BR>
above me <BR>
wordless <BR>
waiting <BR>
still as a storm <BR>
your heart exploding <BR>
inside me <BR>
