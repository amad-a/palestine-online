<p>Why is it "harsh" to compare the Israelis to the Nazis? Can it be that our own popular culture has brainwashed us to think that killing people and stealing their land is a different crime when done by Germans rather than Israelis? Mass lunacy, the mentality of the American masses cultivated by our mass media, is nonetheless lunacy.</p> 

 <p>Of course my description of what the Israelis are doing is "harsh." That is because of what they are doing, not because of me. Shawn, look at your own unconscious assumptions. You say there is "a bit of nastiness" on both sides because "the Syrians are 10 times worse than the Israelis." The Syrians are NOT the Palestinians, despite the attempt of our Zionist mass media to convince us that all Arabs are the same, regardless of what country they live in. I will join you in condemning the repression and brutality that the government of Syria (and, while we are at it, Turkey, Jordan, Algeria, Kuwait, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Mauritania) visit on their own people, and demanding an end to US government support for those governments). One of the most evil assumptions of the 20th Century is that somehow evil in one place or epoch justifies it everywhere always. The Germans pointed to the Holocaust they suffered in World War I (over 14 million dead!) as justification for the horrors they visited on Europe in World War II.</p> 

<p>The Zionists, even today, point to the Holocaust the Jews suffered in World War II to justify the horrors they visit on the Palestinians. You ask, If the Palestinians were given freedom would they be more forgiving of their persecutors than were the Germans or the Zionists? I doubt it. Does this justify continuing the Holocaust against them? No more than German fear of Jewish revenge justified continuing the Nazi Holocaust after it was underway. The cycle of hate and murder has to end, and it cannot end until the Zionists, who foment the hate and murder against the Palestinians, get out of the Palestinians' land the way the Germans eventually got out of Poland, thus ending the violence there. You may disagree that the Zionists are just as evil as the Nazis were, but the historical analogy is useful to illustrate the flaw in the major tenet of US propaganda with which the media have brainwashed the American masses--the idea that the Israelis and the Palestinians are two equal forces. Consider the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943. You no doubt would have been right in that time to say that there was "considerable nastiness on both sides." But would you argue that the Jewish student who assassinated a German soldier on the streets of Warsaw was in exactly the same moral posture as the German soldier who shot the Jewish student? Do you really believe that the people who resist the occupation of their land with rocks and bottles are morally no better than the soldiers who shoot them with automatic weapons? Underlying your argument, Shawn, is the assumption that the Zionists and the Palestinians are arguing over land that belongs--morally or legally, I can't tell from what you say--to both of them. That is like saying the Germans had as much right to the land they conquered in Poland in 1939 as the Poles had. If you had lived in Germany in 1943, of course, you might reasonably have believed that to be the case, based on the information your government let you have. But you and I have to dig deeper than the New York Times and CNN, just as the people of Germany (that 10 percent who voted against Hitler in 1934) had to dig for information about what their rulers truly were up to.</p>

<p>To break the cycle of revenge, there must be an international solution in the Middle East. The Palestinians already are begging for a United Nations force in the occupied territories to protect them from the Israelis. I would recommend the occupation of Palestine by United Nations troops to protect the Israelis as they leave the occupied territories. The same troops would oversee the resettlement of the Palestinian refugees. The Palestinians who were driven from their homes starting in 1948 should be given the choice of returning to their land, with fair compensation for the time somebody else was using it, or a purely monetary settlement by Israel for their damages, much the way Germany has paid billions to Jewish survivors of the Nazi Holocaust for their damages. Israelis who now live in houses that would be returned to Palestinian owners who chose to reclaim their land would be compensated with comparable housing as nearly in the same neighborhood as possible. An international peace keeping force would impose on all parties a constitution like that imposed by international pressure on South Africa, outlawing any religious or racial discrimination (this would benefit a lot of African Jews, as well as native Palestinians) for public office or the franchise. I would like to see all the war criminals prosecuted, just as the German war criminals were prosecuted after World War II, but I can't believe that will ever happen.</p>

  <p>If the United States continues to obey orders from its Israeli masters to veto any United Nations intervention, then the Holocaust will continue. You know as well as I, Shawn, that history lasts a long time. If there is no peace other than Israeli suppression of the Palestinians by butchery, then the day will come when the Palestinians will have their revenge, mostly on innocent people, just as the
Germans got their revenge for World War I, mostly on innocent people, and the Zionists continue to get their revenge for World War II, mostly on innocent people. In other words, the same old cycle. Right now the United States government has no policy except to fund and arm the Israeli killing machine. It is made possible by the belief of the US masses that the Palestinians are somehow "just as bad" if not completely deserving of the repression. That belief--that the victims were just as bad as their killers--made the German masses support the Nazi killing machine. At some point, somebody, you, I hope, has to question the official version, and enlist the help of enough other people to break the cycle.</p>
