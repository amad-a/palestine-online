					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>Please tell us, who is Ahmad Beni Nomra?</B></FONT>
					<DD>I was raised in Salfit by a humble family. My father was a Jordanian political prisoner. My mother suffered a lot from interrogation by Israeli intelligence. My brother was arrested on several occasions and died from interrogation by the Israelis in 1990. Feeling the responsibility of a large family facing hardship forced me to start working at age 10. I felt it was more important to help the family than to go to school, especially since my older brother was in jail.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>When did you become a political activist?</B></FONT>
					<DD>I joined the Democratic Front in 1978 and before that, I was very involved in student organizations. In 1983 I joined one of the military factions.
					<DT><B><FONT size="-1">Tell us about your reaction to the explosion and how you got arrested?</FONT></B>
					<DD>The first moments were very hard, I felt very thirsty.  I asked for water. I was not aware of what had happened to me but I felt the dangerous situation I was in. Pain was all over my body where it was full of debris. I fainted momentarily. When I regained consciousness, I asked my friend to lay me on the edge of the main road. All that I was concerned about was that none of my friends would suffer because of me.
					<DT><B><FONT size="-1">What happened after that?</FONT></B>
					<DD>I was transferred to Ramalah Hospital. Before the doctors were able to help me, the Israeli soldiers arrived and transferred me with their ambulance to Haddasa Hospital.
					<DT><B><FONT size="-1">How did the doctors treat you?</FONT></B>
					<DD>I was not sure if they were doctors or interrogators in doctors' uniforms. I was interrogated while in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. What helped a lot was my inability to talk.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>Was there a possibility of saving your arms?</B></FONT>
					<DD>I do not know. I am not sure if my arms were amputated because of the explosion or afterwards.<BR>I tried to obtain medical records from Ramallah Hospital but the Israeli Authority denied my request. I asked Hadassah Hospital as well, but to no avail. Let me tell you the story of Fathi Zqout a political prisoner, who's arm was amputated although they could have saved it. They (Israeli Authority) told him: "We are going to amputate your arm so you can be a lesson to others, unable to do any other act against Israel". Maybe I faced the same situation.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>Tell us a little about your family views and when was the first visit?</B></FONT>
					<DD>I was at the hospital for 18 days, my family was allowed to visit me on the last day. Seeing them enabled me to breathe better. My mother was very supportive and lifted my spirits but my sister cried. I asked her not to. My family was very supportive and encouraging, which later helped me to face the interrogators.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>What about the treatment from the doctors and nurses?</B></FONT>
					<DD>I was chained to the bed by my legs. Every time I tried to move I faced problems. One day I had a rupture in my stomach because of the debris. Because of the severe bleeding it was vital to transfer me immediately to surgery, but the police officer was not there to unchain me. The hospital staff tried to transfer me with the bed but to no avail, because the bed was larger than the door of the room. They brought a saw to unchain me when the police showed up. Screams and quarrels broke out between the doctor and the officer. The doctor accused the officer of trying to kill me. At 2:30 AM I finally had surgery. Part of my stomach and intestine were removed and I am still suffering because of that.<BR>An Ethiopian nurse tried to suffocate me with a billow while I was being transferred to the operation room, right in front of his colleagues and the police officer who was guarding me. It was lucky that I spoke Hebrew so I understood his curses. I replied that he was the killer and what he was doing now is the proof. On the other hand I was treated well by a nurse whose house I had painted in the past and two other volunteers were very helpful and kind to me, one was from Thailand and the other from Holland.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>How did you get to this situation?</B></FONT>
					<DD>At the beginning it was very hard and I was hesitant in asking for assistance. But the support and help of my fellow prisoners made me overcome it. I started to adapt myself to the situation so I can perform my basic needs. As you can see I taught myself to write, smoke and eat.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>How do you do that?</B></FONT>
					<DD>With the help of a great invention (He smiled and pulled out of his pocket a piece of wood about 15cm in length with a hole on one of its ends. He then pulled a rubber band that he twisted around his arm and supported the stick of wood through it, then he put a cigarette in the hole. I was impressed, and asked how he was going to light it? Offering to light it, he refused and lit it himself).<BR>This was the invention of one of the brothers in jail. It helped me a lot because I use it for smoking and eating.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>How about life in jail and the problems that you faced with your new situation?</B></FONT>
					<DD>At the beginning, I was embarrassed to ask for help from my fellow prisoners. Their support helped to break dawn the walls that were between us and helped me overcome all my problems. In a short period of time I was able to feed myself and smoke through the great invention that I showed you earlier. But there is no doubt that being in jail itself is hard and agonizing.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>How do people treat you? Do their stares bother you?</B></FONT>
					<DD>Sometimes a child looks at me in surprise and in fear but after talking with them they salute me.<BR>Adults on the other hand encourage me by saying, "May God give you the strength". Other times I am asked how I take care of myself and that doesn't bother me or hurt my feelings.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>How were you received by your family after being freed?</B></FONT>
					<DD>When I was released on 12/31/1998 my family was not made aware until shortly before it happened. They were waiting for me at the checkpoint by Betwnia with relatives and friends. I arrived in Salfit at midnight. I was welcomed with festivities as if it was a wedding. Everybody came out to the streets and celebrated with me. For two weeks our house was full of people from dawn till midnight. Officials come as well to congratulate me on my freedom.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>What are your plans for the future?</B></FONT>
					<DD>Nowadays I am going through medical treatment for artificial limbs. About my eye, I was told that it was lost and the only thing they can do is to implant a glass eye which I refused. My wound is still bleeding because my friends are still behind bars".
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>Would you like to add something?</B></FONT>
					<DD>"It is the duty of every liberator to consider political prisoners as an important pillar in their fight towards freedom and it is very important to keep up the effort of freeing every political prisoner". I am very disappointed that the Palestinian Authority exercises imprisonment of political activists as imposed on them by the security treaties with Israel. I call for the unification of our factions in order to obtain our national rights. We are the soldiers of our homeland as long as we are breathing.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>Did you start treatment for artificial limbs?</B></FONT>
					<DD>Yes I visited the Arab Orthopedic Association in Bethlehem and after extensive x-rays and medical check ups, I was informed by the doctors that it is still possible for me to use artificial limbs even though I was medically ignored while in jail. I was told as well that a surgery could be preformed on my left arm to lengthen it. This operation would be very difficult and requires long term care. Let me add that having artificial limps is very crucial to my future.
					<DT><FONT size="-1"><B>Is there an organization that follows up on your status and pays for the medical expenses?</B></FONT>
					<DD>Up to date I do that myself with help from my family. None of the organizations within the Palestinian Authority or anybody else offered to help with the costly medical expenses. Some friends addressed my situation with the Palestinian Minster of Finance. There are rumors that the Minster promised that he would see to it that I am taken care of.<BR>Political prisoners organizations are unable to financially help, but the Israeli authorities would make it hard for me to go abroad to seek help.<BR>I would like to ask that who is capable of helping me with my situation, especially medically, please do so.<BR>I am very thankful. Our nation is great and giving in all situations.
