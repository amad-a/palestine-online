<p>Hello. I am 19 years old Arabic Human. And each human has his own viewpoints and believes. Maybe I believe in some things that none of this page organizers believe in. But I do really think that exchanging ideas and opinions is surely better than just wasting time in night clubs and hanging out with girls to satisfy the sexual desire that each guy love to do at this age.</p>
<p>I am a university student in the States. I think that I can be beneficial to my community that I am known between my friends as a knowledged- person.
To get to the point, I would really like to voluntary to participate as a YOUNG Arab who has special -mostly alike- dreams and ambitions to convey to all Palestinians, Arabs, and Moslems. As from the perspective of  Arabic youth, it is not suitable to separate YOUTH from BIG ADULTS. 
Yaaaa, how old is the youngest editor or worker in this magazine? Probably in the thirties.</p>
<p>For how many more years is the youngest magazine-worker going to live? God Knows. But, probably not to long.</p>
<p>Who is the new generation that will entirely be responsible for the future of all your holly dreams  that you all are striving for?</p>
<p>What is the economic cost of granting some realistic responsibilities to 
YOUTH? Probably more Patience.</p>
<p>What is the economic benefit of manipulating the various abilities of  
YOUTH? Probably outweighs its costs.</p>
<p>Moreover, The ideas and believes of YOUTH will not totally differ from the believes we grew up learning from our parents and culture!</p>
<p>Sirs, GIVE IT A TRY. GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR THOSE YOUTH WHO CAN BE RELIED ON TO CARRY ON YOUR PURE MESSAGES. PULL THEM OUT OF NIGHTCLUBS IN EVERY PLACE OF THE WORLD & FREE THEM FROM THEIR TINY-SELFISH DREAMS OF HAVING MORE SEX, MONEY, CARS OR HIGHER POSITIONS. IT IS YOUR TASKS TO QUALIFY  ALL YOUTH FOR THE FUTURE, AND THEN THE YOUTH ROLES CAN START TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR OUT-OF-REACH DREAMS.</p> 
<p>All I was trying to say is:</p>
<p>Do you mind having voluntary YOUTH helpers in your magazines and giving them complete independency to stand up and say what they want? Please Clarify.</p>
<p>Thanks for being considerate and patient.</p>
<p>Eagerly awaiting your reply,<br>
<i>An Arab Moslem Dreamer In The States.</i></p>
