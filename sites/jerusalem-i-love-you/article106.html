<p>I maintain the website Marxist-Leninist Newswire and I live in (........) USA. I've been writing under the names "goy" and "Adam Rice" on indymedia.org recently. Taking part in the "flames" against the defenders of Palestine (not very dignified at times). I'm a very great supporter of the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p>I became so after I had done some spiritual searching in my life and, to make a long story short, I went to Jerusalem. At any rate, I took up Jewish conversion and went to Yeshiva in Jerusalem for a year. </p>

<p>Through that experience I learn "Torah" and came to know what Judaism really is. I left there with two broken arms, I had spent several days in the hospital after being beaten by rampaging Jews one of who claimed to be police official one of the others a convert whom I had met in Kyriat Arb'a, the other two I didn't know. They put Rodev" on me after I had accused one of them of believing in slavery.</p> 

<p>Over the entire year I was eventually robbed of everything I owned, including my clothes. I literally left there a broken man with the clothes on my back, lucky to be alive. I was absolutely penniless and had been living in Palestinian village of Lifta (confiscated by Israel) near the end of my stay (I had left the Yeshiva, because I couldn't stand them anymore). </p>

<p>Of course those people tried to poison my mind against the Palestinians, but that illusion quickly evaporated after I had worked in restaurants and as a carpenter with several Palestinians in Jerusalem. I walked through Palestinian neighborhoods, e.g. the walk from Kyriat Arb'a to Machpelah, and through Maalot Daphne in Jerusalem up to Hebrew University on Mt. Scorpis (where I was of course "forbidden" to go), and over the other side of Mt. Aleph in to the Palestinian neighborhoods and I can say, even dressed as a Torah Jew, I was never really afraid of the Palestinians. </p>

<p>As for the Jews, life is so much different down there on Ben Yehuda Square in Underground and in the Arizona (local bars if you are not familiar with Al-Qods). People beating the sh-t out of each other night after night. If you are "Goyim" you have much to fear from them, for they have no respect for anything living or dead.</p>

<p>In the end, however, this I learned: I am a Goy and they are the Jews. (Since I never really converted). I profoundly feel that, through that experience, I have seen evil face-to-face. As Nietzsche said "as one looks into the abyss, the abyss looks into you". I looked in and didn't like what I saw, but neither did they. And I suppose I should be grateful for I am much the wiser man for that.</p> 

<p>But I promised myself after that I would fight for the freedom of Palestine, for I have never seen or even know about a greater injustice in the world than that which has been committed against your people. What the Jews have done to Palestine is absolutely the most heinous crime of the century. </p>

<p>I am very grateful to you for taking-up this struggle, for your websites. <br>
These truths must be told. And I believe that every "Goy" may have a small stake in the outcome of this struggle.</p>

<p>I will help you anyway I can. I am not wealthy or important. I just maintain my website in my spare time. Anything you need just ask. </p>
