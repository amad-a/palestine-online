      </font></b><font face="Arial"> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Traditional forms 
        of media divide those who make the news from those who present it. Large 
        corporations and states monopolize and shape the media, delivering information 
        in ways that serve their own interests, rather than as objective reporting 
        on events. The pretence of the mainstream media&#146;s objectivity belies 
        its very bias.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Since the Oslo accords 
        of 1993, local media in Palestine have depicted the political situation 
        as a battle between those for or against "peace." Since the nature of 
        this peace is never interrogated, a false dichotomy has constrained the 
        limits of officially sanctioned debate and discussion. Consequently, anyone 
        outside of Palestine is likely to form a distorted view of recent events. 
        Those inside Palestine are disturbed by the ever-widening gap between 
        their lived reality and the images presented by the mainstream media. 
        Voices expressing most Palestinians&#146; views are seldom heard in the 
        mainstream media. In the words of Edward Said, mainstream media have refused 
        Palestinians "permission to narrate."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Although alternative 
        sources of information do exist, they tend to reach only those with the 
        will, patience or good fortune to find them. Alternative media have always 
        been hindered by financial problems and insufficient means of dissemination.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The advent of the 
        Internet is gradually improving the frustrating media situation in Palestine. 
        Its impact is evident in the experiences of Birzeit University students. 
        Located near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Birzeit University (BZU) 
        launched its website in 1994,(1) one of the first Palestinian institutions 
        in the West Bank and Gaza to do so. At critical points in the last few 
        years, BZU&#146;s website has provided important sources of alternative 
        information compared to traditional media sources. The WWW has introduced 
        a new dynamic into the relationship between those who receive information 
        and those who produce it: The WWW serves as both an informational and 
        an organizational tool.</font></p>
      <b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">More Than Words</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The web encourages 
        a multimedia presentation of news stories. This allows not only for a 
        livelier format, but also gives media workers a wide array of choices 
        for conveying information in the most compelling and comprehensive manner. 
        It is easy and virtually free to broadcast video and audio over the web. 
        Multi-media formats provide a more immediate and fine-grained view of 
        evolving realities and help break the domination of mainstream media by 
        choosing which images of Palestine are presented, and how.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A good illustration 
        of the Web&#146;s power and reach was the "On the Ground in Ramallah" 
        website created by BZU staff during the violent September 1996 clashes.(2) 
        Images of Israeli army helicopters hovering threateningly over Ramallah 
        and compelling eyewitness reports provided powerful, daily counterpoints 
        to the international media&#146;s version of events. In the two weeks 
        between September 27 and October 12, 1996, the "On the Ground in Ramallah" 
        site received more than 3,000 "hits" (individual visits). Compared to 
        the current 40,000 hits per month on the BZU website, this may seem unimpressive, 
        but given the infancy of the WWW in Palestine three years ago, it was 
        a significant number.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 1996 experience 
        has since been replicated and enhanced. News on BZU&#146;s website includes 
        pictures and occasionally sound and video, too. During last year&#146;s 
        coverage of the Gaza Students Action Campaign,(3) the BZU website featured 
        video footage of demonstrations, audio interviews with Gazan students 
        (in Arabic and English), as well as photographs of various campaign events. 
        A separate website was established especially for the campaign, the first 
        and only campaign website based in Palestine.(4)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">BZU also launched 
        a popular online radio station in October 1998: BZU OutLoud,(5) which 
        anyone with a computer can access. Around 700 people listen to each show 
        <i>via</i> the WWW (with listeners to the Arabic show equal in number 
        to those of the English show). Not only does this provide a powerful connection 
        between Palestinians outside and those still in the homeland, but it also 
        allows people to hear things they never would in mainstream media reporting 
        on Palestine. Several local radio stations in the West Bank are now considering 
        going online, and the Palestinian Legislative Council is developing its 
        own website and planning to include Real Audio broadcasts of events and 
        interviews with council members.</font></p>
      <b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">News by Newsmakers</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The WWW allows us 
        to respond to events quickly and to achieve wide distribution. In December 
        1998, BZU students called a hunger strike in solidarity with political 
        prisoners. During the strike, BZU&#146;s Webteam videotaped student leaders 
        from all political blocs in both English and Arabic and featured these 
        interviews on the website along with daily news stories about the strike.(6) 
        We could have done a conventional story for a journal or newsletter, appearing 
        a month after the end of the event. We could have contacted CNN, hoping 
        that they might take time or divert attention and personnel from President 
        Clinton&#146;s Gaza visit to come to Birzeit. Instead, we reached thousands 
        of people throughout the world daily, virtually for free. This is an example 
        of how the Internet lets Palestinians speak for themselves in their own 
        voice without mediation or distortion from outside bodies or interests. 
        Those involved in newsworthy events can choose what to present, rather 
        than passively allowing others (who may have very different objectives) 
        to represent and reinterpret developments in Palestine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Internet also 
        alters the traditional relationship between the audience and speaker(s). 
        The hunger strike demonstrated this trend powerfully. We received hundreds 
        of emails during the strike, which had a great impact on students. At 
        the end of each day, students eagerly asked for new emails, which they 
        read and translated each night while sitting around a fire. Heated debates 
        often followed about emails and topics such as religion, support from 
        Israelis and the role of the Palestinian Authority. By the third day, 
        the students decided to reply to everyone who had sent messages of support. 
        They sat down together and drafted a letter that was posted on the website.(7) 
        It was a very moving and thoughtful response, which also solicited replies 
        from readers worldwide. This established a valuable dialogue that would 
        not have been possible through conventional means. Indeed, several students 
        began a regular email correspondence with people who had first contacted 
        them during the strike. This example demonstrates the many-to-many nature 
        of Internet communication and its immense political potential in comparison 
        to the traditional one-to-many nature of traditional media.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Another compelling 
        example of the Internet&#146;s many-to-many political and cultural potential 
        was a series of interviews conducted by Rosemary Sayigh and Ghena Ismail 
        with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The interviews, recorded on normal 
        cassettes, were based on questions sent by the BZU webteam. The answers 
        were then sent back and broadcast on Birzeit Outloud(8). Palestinian refugees 
        living in the West Bank listened to their counterparts in Lebanon, and 
        were asked the same questions, which were broadcast in turn on the radio 
        station, creating a dialogue between people separated for half a century.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Internet also 
        provides considerable information not available elsewhere. This includes 
        not only news about Palestine difficult to access in the West, but also 
        information unavailable internally. On more than one occasion, local media 
        neglected to report on key events occurring in Palestine. These events 
        were reported on the Internet, such as a 1998 hunger strike by Palestinian 
        prisoners in Jneid prison under the Palestinian Authority.</font></p>
      <b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">An Organizing Tool</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Internet can play 
        a powerful organizing as well as informational role; indeed the two roles 
        are closely linked. Discussion groups that debate issues in an open, democratic 
        and immediate way are an excellent example. Any post can immediately reach 
        hundreds of people with an equal right to reply. The best recent example 
        of the organizational potential of these discussion groups was the 1999 
        campaign against the Burger King franchise in the Israeli settlement of 
        Ma&#145;ale Adumim. The campaign began through discussions on Freedom 
        List(9) (a discussion list run from Jerusalem), and drew in thousands 
        of individuals and organizations in a way that would have been difficult 
        using traditional organizing methods. The WWW&#146;s organizational capacity 
        is particularly important in Palestine, where solidarity networks are 
        currently very weak. Rebuilding networks between people at the grassroots 
        level is crucial for progressive politics, and the Internet can play a 
        key role in this process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Internet&#146;s 
        organizing potential was a driving force behind the Across Borders Project(10) 
        launched by BZU&#146;s Information Technology Unit this year. The project 
        aims to establish Internet centers in Palestinian refugee camps across 
        the Middle East and to encourage refugees to build websites describing 
        their lives in the camps and thereby sharing their experiences and hopes 
        for the future with each other and with the wider world. A key objective 
        of the project is to rebuild and strengthen links between different, widely 
        separated refugee communities. The first center was launched in July 1999 
        in Dheisheh Refugee Camp(11) and a second center is currently underway 
        in the Gaza Strip. Centers are also in progress in camps in Lebanon.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Hypermedia: Deep Information</font></p>
      </b> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Internet is based 
        on hypermedia: Information is presented in a dynamic, multi-layered fashion 
        rather than as a static and isolated page of text. Hyperlinks on the WWW 
        enable people to jump between topics, concepts and sites with ease. The 
        Internet allows users to explore, define and shape concepts in a much 
        more immediate and effective way than through conventional forms of information 
        exchange. For example, an expository article on Palestine might include 
        embedded links to relevant political agreements, background information, 
        photographs, maps and explanatory diagrams. In traditional text-based 
        media, readers usually need to go away&#151;physically, to a library&#151;to 
        find key references that help them understand or verify the original source. 
        Interspersing text with links to background or secondary information increases 
        the text&#146;s depth. If this article were on the WWW, all of the examples 
        could be linked and immediately accessed by the reader, rendering the 
        main points and the connections between different concepts that much clearer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Barriers to Internet 
        Expansion in Palestine</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It is certainly not 
        this author&#146;s aim to present the WWW as a magic solution to all the 
        problems facing Palestinians today. Internet access in Palestine is limited, 
        and linguistic and cultural barriers can be formidable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A recently published 
        survey conducted by the Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics(12) reveals 
        the extent and nature of Internet access in Palestine. Only 6.9 percent 
        of households in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have a computer. The total 
        number of household computers in Palestine is 33,867, and most are concentrated 
        in the West Bank (29,038 in the West Bank as opposed to 4,829 in the Gaza 
        Strip). Of these, 24,723 are located in urban areas. Refugee camps have 
        the lowest number, just 2,554.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Major Palestinian 
        population centers enjoy fairly dense Internet service provision (ISPs). 
        Ten ISPs cover major population centers: Jerusalem (6), Ramallah (4), 
        Bethlehem (4), Hebron (2), Tulkarem (1), Qalqilya (1), Jenin (1), Nablus 
        (2) and Gaza (3).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Costs for Internet 
        access through an ISP range from US$10-25 per month for dial-up access 
        and $200-400 for a permanent connection. It should be remembered that 
        the average Palestinian wage is just over US$300 each month.(13)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Currently, Palestinians 
        cannot directly access the Internet "backbone." All Palestinian ISPs must 
        go through an Israeli service provider. Internet bandwidth ranges from 
        128 K to 768 K. Palestinian ISPs have an estimated 8000 clients, representing 
        individual, institutional and corporate customers. The actual number of 
        Palestinians who use the Internet is much higher, however. All universities 
        have Internet access, as do several high schools. Palestine has recently 
        witnessed a proliferation of Internet cafes at reasonable prices (the 
        number in the West Bank town of Ramallah grew from one in early 1998 to 
        eight by mid-1999). These cafes are crowded at all hours of the day and 
        night.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">According to figures 
        gathered by the BZU Web Team,(14) the number of websites located in the 
        West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem grew from 9 in early 1996 to 228 in 
        September 1999. Many Palestinian organizations use the web in an impressive 
        manner and have expanded their cyber-presence over the last 12 months.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The WWW affords crucial 
        access to alternative information not found in the mainstream media. It 
        has also engendered a qualitative shift in the nature of that information. 
        The WWW is not a panacea for all problems related to media control and 
        access; at this stage its true potential is as yet unknown and its role 
        remains contested. Those concerned with Palestine or progressive struggles 
        at large must work together to shape the WWW&#146;s role, capacity and 
        powers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Experience over the 
        last three years has shown that Palestinians have an enthusiastic appreciation 
        of the WWW&#146;s potential. Yet we must not forget the nature and extent 
        of the barriers preventing its further expansion. These barriers&#151;mainly 
        related to repression and poverty resulting from Israel&#146;s continuing 
        occupation of Palestine&#151;will only be overcome through collective 
        action by Palestinians living in the region in solidarity with those outside. 
        The WWW can be a key tool in motivating and organizing such collective 
        action.</font></p>
