        called with reference to the various steps leading up to El-Refa&#146;ee waterwheel which
        is located in the southern part. Some, however, say that the name refers to a distance
        view of the place which appears to the onlooker as stairs made up of many steps. The
        former, however is more accurate. This name goes back to the Ottoman era. The ancient name
        of El-Daraj neighborhood was Bani Amer given after an Arabian tribe that inhabited Gaza at
        the outset of the Islamic Conquest. During the Mameluk era, El-Daraj was called
        El-Barjalia, this is a direct reference to the defenders of the surveillance towers
        located near the eastern wall of the city. Until now, El-Daraj has been an architectural
        and commercial center. It is distinguished for its antique markets such as El-Kesaria
        Market which is still there, the disappearing Khan El-Katen, Khan Zeith and Grains Market
        of which some reminiscent but in need of amelioration.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        old quarters of El-Daraj used to have ceilings and were called Sobats, an example was
        Sobat El-mufti which was removed in the sixties of the present century. To the East of
        El-Daraj, there has been and, is still there, the pottery quarter which has been known for
        pottery making. In this area, the Moslems had constructed several mosques, prayer rooms,
        general baths, schools and libraries. Of these, the most important is El-Omary Mosque
        which is located in the city center. This place has been sanctified by the Gazans for
        three thousand years, since the heathen and until it was converted into a mosque by Omar
        Ibn El-Assi in response to Moslems&#146; demand. The Moslems had restored and ameliorated
        the mosque several times and this can be demonstrated by the inscriptions found on some
        stones of the door steps and the thresholds and window stills. The inscriptions on the
        Eastern door read as &quot;By the will of Sultan Mansour Hussam El-Dein Abu El-Fateh
        Lajeen El-Mansouri 1297 AD.&quot; In 730 Hijri Sultan Mohammed Guallown ordered an
        extension of the mosque. A portico was constructed with a door leading up to El-Kesaria.
        In 1788 AD the minaret of the mosque war restored and in 1875 AD during the time of
        Ra&#146;oof Basha, the commander of El-Quds, the whole mosque was renovated. The final
        restoration had been in 1345 Hijri when the mosque was devastated by the allies&#146; navy
        in the First World War. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other
        ancient mosques in El-Daraj neighborhood. In this respect, it is important to mention
        mosques like El-Sheikh Zakaryia, El-Wazeeri, El-Sayed Hashem and El-Ahmadia prayer room.
        El-Sayed Hashem, prophet Mohammad&#146;s grandfather, (peace upon him), is strongly
        believed to have been buried in that mosque which was first constructed by the Mameluk. </font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1266, the
        Ottoman Sultan Abed El-Majeed ordered the renovation of the mosque. During the First World
        War, the mosque was hit by a shell and was greatly damaged, yet, the High Islamic Council
        restored it. In this part of the city, there used to be some public baths such as the
        Market and the Soldiers&#146; baths.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most
        important antique buildings at El-Daraj, has been the palace of Al-Redwan family which is
        still present and mistaken for Napoelon castle, El-Zahra Secondary School at present. The
        Construction style of this building does not indicate a military function as it is a two
        storey building with Windows. The palace was built during the reign of Al-Redwan princes
        who ruled the city at the outset of Ottoman era and remained in power until the
        seventeenth century. The inscriptions, the Islamic drawings and decorations shows on the
        stones, in addition to certain stones carrying the lion logo of Elzaher Peipers 1260-1277
        AD, substantiate the fact that the building&#146;s history goes back to Al-Redwan reign.
        However, it is noteworthy to mention that Napoleon took the palace as a temporary
        headquarters during his invasion to Ako in 1799.</font></td>
