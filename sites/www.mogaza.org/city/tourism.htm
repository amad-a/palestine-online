    in Gaza depends mainly on the sea whose shores are famous for their golden bright sand;
    several precautionary measures have been taken to protect the shores from pollution.
    Tourism also depends on the archeological and historical sites, which are wide spread in
    Gaza; more archeological sites are under exploration. Gaza is famous for its moderate
    weather in the summer and winter, which encourages the people, to go to the beaches, parks
    and gardens. People also spend their leisure time on farms, orchards, and at touristic
    facilities. </p>
    <p ALIGN="center"></font><font size="4"><font color="#804040"><strong>The Sea </strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font SIZE="2">The most beautiful sights in Gaza are the sea,
    the beaches, the coast, the sky, the golden bright sand, the sun and warmth, and the soft
    breeze. Gaza is the beautiful mermaid, which attracts tourists to its sea and beaches.
    Gaza depends on tourism. It is expected that the number of tourists and tourist trade
    would increase after the declaration of the independent Palestinian State. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several fantastic tourist projects were implemented on the sea beach;
    they provide the visitors of the city and the sea with the services they need. Gaza
    municipality has given the beaches special concern because of their important role in
    attracting tourists and residents. The municipality cleans the beaches and works on
    developing them. It also provides beach observers and lifeguards in the summer, the
    busiest tourist season. The municipality has taken several preventive measures to protect
    the waters and beaches from pollution. It implemented several projects for sewage and
    treatment. </p>

    <p ALIGN="center"></font><font size="-1"><img src="ruins.jpg" WIDTH="438" HEIGHT="169"></font><font size="4"></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font SIZE="2">Gaza and its surroundings are considered a
    historical museum and a painting on which history carved a valuable and glorious heritage.
    It is one of the cities in the world, which has a large historical and archeological
    heritage; many events took place in the city. A large number of ruins were discovered
    after excavations started in the nineteenth century. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaza City, which is now full of houses, streets and fields, hides
    magnificent historical treasures under its sand. They should be excavated in order to
    manifest our deep-rooted Arab identity at the time when we face a foreign enemy, which has
    no history. The enclosed areas, from the northern to the southern end are like an
    integrated historical painting. Thus, it is not surprising that Herodos, &quot;Father of
    History&quot;, called it 'the great city' or &quot;Beilini&quot;, the Roman historian,
    praised its greatness. Unfortunately, many of the wonderful pieces of ruins were stolen,
    destroyed, smuggled, or buried by time or because of negligence. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ruins in Gaza did not get the attention they deserve during the
    past decades; they remained neglected without any research, documentation or maintenance.
    The Israeli occupation period had witnessed what we might call &quot;the ruins
    massacre&quot; because important pieces were stolen in a planned and systematic method.
    High Israeli officials including Moshe Dayan have done this. When the National Palestinian
    Authority took over, there were serious efforts paid by the concerned parties to restore
    the ruins; Gaza municipality has an important role in that. As a result, these places have
    regained their beauty and their historical and Islamic importance so as to be a window
    through which the world can look at our culture and which encourage tourists to visit our
    great ruins. </p>
