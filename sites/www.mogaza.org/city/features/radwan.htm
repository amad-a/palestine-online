    <td width="100%"><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The quarter of Sheikh Radwan was
    established to the north of the city so as to evacuate Shati Camp and resettle the
    refugees whose houses were demolished by the Israeli occupation authorities, in the first
    stage. In the second stage, anyone else who wanted to move from Shati Camp to Sheikh
    Radwan Quarter had to demolish his house in order to obtain a house there. The goal behind
    this project was to resettle the refugees and put an end to their case, but the attempt
    was unsuccessful. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The project was started in 1973 and continued at different stages. The
    residents, at first did not take interest since this process harms their case as refugees.
    However, as a result of the increase in the population, and because the house which the
    head of the family got in the 50s remained as it was despite the large increase in the
    number of the family members (20 people, sometimes, live in a two-room house), people
    moved to Sheikh Radwan. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning, the Gaza Municipality refused to provide services for
    the few residents who settled there. Later, in 1975-1976, Project (A) was implemented; the
    Israeli occupation authorities built houses which consisted of two rooms, a kitchen and
    utilities. After that, they modified their policy and followed the &quot;build your own
    house&quot; plan. They offered the head of the family 250 square meters of land, and the
    head of the family built his house according to his own desire. Sheikh Radwan Project (A)
    was completed in 1973. It contains 1,000 housing units, a shopping center, a school, a
    mosque, and a clinic. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 1978, the implementation of Sheikh Radwan Project (B)
    started. It stretched to the east and north of the previous project. The land was
    distributed - two families were given an area of 250 square meters. Thus, the project
    would absorb 2,200 families. This project is considered an extension of the Nassr and
    Northern Rimal quarters. The project was completed, especially in the eastern part, by the
    end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A project for constructing buildings for housing was implemented in
    Salah Khalaf street, to the northern end of the city. Construction covered most of Nassr
    and Rimal Shamali quarters. The area of this project has reached 700 dunums where 22,000
    people, at present, live.</font></td>
