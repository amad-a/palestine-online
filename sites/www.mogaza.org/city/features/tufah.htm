    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of Gaza districts were built outside the overhill city walls
    during the Ayoubi period and flourished during the Mameluk era. One of those districts is
    El-Sheja&#146;ea which is situated to the east of the ancient city. The name of this part
    of the city refers to the martyr, Shuja' El-Kurdy, who died in a battle between Saladin
    and the Crusaders in 1239. The northern part of this district is called Judaydah while the
    southern part is known as Turkman. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important sites of El-Seja&#146;ea is the Mosque of
    Ahmed Iben Othman which is called the big mosque. It lies in the center of the district
    amidst the commercial center. Yalkhja, one of the followers of Mameluk Sultan Zaher
    Barkouk, and who was appointed as chief commander of Gaza in 849 AD is buried in this
    mosque. The various foundation stones demonstrate that the mosque was restored in the
    ninth century BC. The inscriptions and the gorgeous decorations on its minaret add some
    beauty to the mosque. Another beautiful sight of El-Sheja&#146;ea is El-Mahkama Mosque the
    inscriptions of which show that there was a school of great value inside the mosque. There
    are other ancient mosques such as El-Tawashi, Sheikh Mosafer and El-Takzadory. The latter
    used to have El-Sheja&#146;ea public bath. </p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The graveyard which is situated to the east of El-Sheja&#146;ea and is
    called either El-Tunisia or El-Tefleesy is believed to, have had the tombs of many martyrs
    and religious men. An annual festival called El-Khomsan, Thursdays, would be held in
    allegiance to those men.</font></td>
