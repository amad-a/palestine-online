        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tourism in Gaza
        depends mainly on the sea whose shores are famous for their golden bright sand; several
        precautionary measures have been taken to protect the shores from pollution. Tourism also
        depends on the archeological and historical sites, which are wide spread in Gaza; more
        archeological sites are under exploration. Gaza is famous for its moderate weather in the
        summer and winter, which encourages the people, to go to the beaches, parks and gardens.
        People also spend their leisure time on farms, orchards, and at touristic facilities. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#804040" face="Verdana, Arial" size="4"><strong>The Sea: </strong></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most
        beautiful sights in Gaza are the sea, the beaches, the coast, the sky, the golden bright
        sand, the sun and warmth, and the soft breeze. Gaza is the beautiful mermaid, which
        attracts tourists to its sea and beaches. Gaza depends on tourism. It is expected that the
        number of tourists and tourist trade would increase after the declaration of the
        independent Palestinian State. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several
        fantastic tourist projects were implemented on the sea beach; they provide the visitors of
        the city and the sea with the services they need. Gaza municipality has given the beaches
        special concern because of their important role in attracting tourists and residents. The
        municipality cleans the beaches and works on developing them. It also provides beach
        observers and lifeguards in the summer, the busiest tourist season. The municipality has
        taken several preventive measures to protect the waters and beaches from pollution. It
        implemented several projects for sewage and treatment. </font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaza and its
        surroundings are considered a historical museum and a painting on which history carved a
        valuable and glorious heritage. It is one of the cities in the world, which has a large
        historical and archeological heritage; many events took place in the city. A large number
        of ruins were discovered after excavations started in the nineteenth century. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaza City,
        which is now full of houses, streets and fields, hides magnificent historical treasures
        under its sand. They should be excavated in order to manifest our deep-rooted Arab
        identity at the time when we face a foreign enemy, which has no history. The enclosed
        areas, from the northern to the southern end are like an integrated historical painting.
        Thus, it is not surprising that Herodos, &quot;Father of History&quot;, called it 'the
        great city' or &quot;Beilini&quot;, the Roman historian, praised its greatness.
        Unfortunately, many of the wonderful pieces of ruins were stolen, destroyed, smuggled, or
        buried by time or because of negligence. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruins in
        Gaza did not get the attention they deserve during the past decades; they remained
        neglected without any research, documentation or maintenance. The Israeli occupation
        period had witnessed what we might call &quot;the ruins massacre&quot; because important
        pieces were stolen in a planned and systematic method. High Israeli officials including
        Moshe Dayan have done this. When the National Palestinian Authority took over, there were
        serious efforts paid by the concerned parties to restore the ruins; Gaza municipality has
        an important role in that. As a result, these places have regained their beauty and their
        historical and Islamic importance so as to be a window through which the world can look at
        our culture and which encourage tourists to visit our great ruins. </font></p>
