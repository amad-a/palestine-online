<p>Palestine-Net is an independent private effort to gather and organize
as much as possible information about Palestine: Land, people,
history, politics, economy, education, culture, travel and
tourism.. you name it. We also hope to increase awareness among
Palestinians around the globe and help them network and make use
of the Internet potential (since, in this digital world, so far,
we are all equal). To (over)emphasize our independence, we do not
accept donations (even if they are unconditional!). There will be
no digital (nor physical) collection boxes in the name (or for
the sake) of this site. <br>
Palestine-Net started as a sub-site in late 1994 under the title "Palestine: The Voice of the Collective Wound" (<a href="/web/20021204193353/http://palestine-net.com/gifs/oldpn.jpg">view a picture</a>) on an educational server. We then moved to a sub-site with a commercial ISP before becoming a full domain name (Palestine-Net) in 1996. The "Voice of the Collective Wound" still comes up in searches, being the 3rd site about Palestine on the web, but the related account is not active anymore (our request to keep a re-directing page was turned down).  Some sites have listed us under PNA by mistake - we are private and independent. </p>
<p>Voluntary submissions of appropriate material, for publication
on this site, is of course, more than welcome - if not strongly
encouraged. Linking to Palestine-Net and telling friends and webmasters about it is something we'd like to thank you for in advance.</p>
<p>If you'd like to take advantage of our very competitive
services, whether you are an individual or a business,
please check out the details at the <a href="/web/20021204193353/http://palestine-net.com/service.html">Palestine-Net Services</a>
page. We provide web page design in Arabic and English, web advertising, programming and translation (A-E, E-A).
</p>
<p>In a nutshell, <i>Palestine-Net is a non-partisan, non-aligned, open and
dedicated effort to serve all Palestinians and Net Citizens.</i> It is
maintained by <b>Alquds Compu-Tech</b>. </p>
