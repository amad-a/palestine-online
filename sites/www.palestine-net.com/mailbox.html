Thank you for visiting Palestine-Net.
<p>
We are sorry, but our feedback form is currently disabled.</p>
<p align="left">
We would like to thank you for trying to share your thoughts - be they angry or calm, civilized or savage. We also extend our sincere thanks to all of you who write and express their solidarity with our cause - may the world turn into a better place for all to live in justice and peace.
</p>
<p><b><u>E-Mail Link</u></b>: We are opening our mailbox with restrictions. If you have an urgent and civilized message, no attachment and no more than a few paragraphs, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803031014/mailto:comments@palestine-net.com">use this link to e-mail us</a>. We may not be able to answer all messages and may report offenders to law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>
Please note that we are not an official Palestinian entity, so there is no point sending us e-mail based on this assumption.
<br>
We have provided a link to a number of resources and many editorials by various columnists (some of them Israeli) to help you balance your sides of the story. A list is provided at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803031014/http://www.zmag.org/meastwatch/meastwat.htm">Mid East Watch</a>. A few of the recent must-reads are: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803031014/http://www.zmag.org/content/Mideast/avnery_jenin-founded.cfm">In Jenin I founded... </a> (Uri Avnery), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803031014/http://www.zmag.org/content/Mideast/fisk_powell_jenin.cfm">Mr Powell Must See For Himself What Israel Inflicted On Jenin</a> (Robert Fisk), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803031014/http://www.zmag.org/content/Mideast/jensenus.cfm">U.S. Culpability</a> (Robert Jensen).
