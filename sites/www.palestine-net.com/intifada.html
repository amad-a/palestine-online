   LYRICS:<br>  
   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   This song is dedicated to the Children of Palestine<br>  
   Lyrics by Lawrence McGuire<br>  
  <br>  
   <b>The Stones of Freedom</b>
 <p>
   In the burning streets of Bethlehem deserted and forlorn<br>  
   Standing with our stones of freedom waiting<br>  
   As prophetic swells of sirens ripped all silence from the air<br>  
   We sang our freedom song and started throwing<br>  
   Throwing at the soldiers, whose guns we do not fear<br>  
   Throwing at the deadly tanks rumbling far and near<br>  
   And at all the mindless money that put the soldiers here<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying
    </p>
  <p>
   In our city's raging violence, undauntedly we threw<br>  
   Our faces fixed on armored cars approaching<br>  
   F-16's echoing over bombed out neighborhoods<br>  
   Steadfast we raised our stones and kept on throwing<br>  
   Throwing at the Generals, War Criminals and Crooks<br>  
   We throw at writers justifying murder in their books,<br>  
   At racist settlers squatting on the land the soldiers took<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying  
    </p>
  <p>
   Five of us together, none more than twelve years old<br>  
   We stood below the circling 'copters cracking<br>  
   Defying evil elements of hatred laced in steel<br>  
   Then Israeli hidden snipers started shooting<br>  
   Shooting at our fathers, kneeling on the ground<br>  
   Blindfolded with the rags of peace, their hands obscenely bound<br>  
   While our mothers search for water they hear the bullets' sound<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying  
    </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the Territories, the name of Palestine<br>  
   Is ringing from the tongues of angry children<br>  
   Denied a child's necessities, we claim our right to be<br>  
   We claim our rights with every stone we're throwing<br>  
   Throwing at Americans who pay the Butcher's bill,<br>  
   Whose diplomats are Generals, they're only trained to kill,<br>  
   We throw at fat politicians who've never missed a meal<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying 
   </p>
  <p>
   Bulldozers crush our olive trees, our homes, our terraces, our
fields<br>  
   To eliminate all trace of our existence<br>  
   But as the cactus that we planted is reborn on stolen land<br>  
   Our freedom grows with every stone we're throwing<br>  
   Throwing at the newspapers, whose Truth is bought and sold<br>  
   At talking television heads who keep our tale from being told<br>  
   Throwing at reporters who ignore us dying in the cold<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying.
   </p>
  <p>
   None dare to call us heroes, none dare to find out why<br>  
   We risk our lives to throw these stones at our oppressors<br>  
   Instead they call us terrorists to justify their terror war<br>  
   In their world soldiers shooting children is not terror<br>  
   We're throwing at the bureaucrats in the United Nations' Hall,<br>  
   At world leaders doing nothing as the bombs of terror fall<br>  
   Throwing at the whole wide world who refuse to hear our call<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying  
  </p>
  <p>  
   The U.S.A. is waiting, watching from on high<br>  
   Pretending that their hands are clean and guiltless<br>  
   But they provide the weapons, they prevent the Peace<br>  
   Apartheid is the goal they are pursuing<br>  
   We're throwing at the hypocrites, the whole dishonest crew<br>  
   At all those participating in what Israeli soldiers do<br>  
   And American taxpayers, we throw our stones at you!<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying.  
  </p>
  <p>
   Occupation takes our innocence, we're sacrificed for greed<br>  
   We're sacrificed for God and Gasoline<br>  
   They shoot us 'cause we have the nerve to demand our liberty<br>  
   Freedom is now all we have to live for<br>  
   We're throwing for the future, for other children to be free<br>  
   While Israel destroys our childhood with blind stupidity<br>  
   We're throwing stones at all you cowards doing nothing so silently<br>  
   We sang and sent the stones of freedom flying
</p>
