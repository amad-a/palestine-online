 <h1>The Palestinian National Covenant, 1968</h1><pre> (See Also: <a href="proc.html">'Israel's Independence' declaration</a>)
 <em>Part of the papers signed by Arafat and Rabin states that Arafat 
should 
remove, from the PNC, clauses that Rabin and Co don't like within 2 
months from 
the January, 20, 1996 'council elections'. The history of the PNC is quite
complicated (drafted under the Arab league supervision earlier, then called:
"al-miithaaq al-Qawmi al-Arabi ... etc - it is not difficult to spot the 
pan-Arab 
and soscialist spices scattered around). A good source is the book by Faisal
Huuraani: The History of the PNC [Arabic]. The translation below is copied
from the source at the end. You may want to ask if the other side had to
edit/modify their own documents ... you probably know the answer.</em>

"This covenant will be called The Palestinian National Covenant (<em>al-
mithaq al-watani al-filastini</em>).
<strong>Article 1:</strong> Palestine is the homeland of the Palestinian 
Arab 
people and an integral part of the great Arab homeland, and the people of 
Palestine is
a part of the Arab nation.
<strong>Article 2:</strong> Palestine with its boundaries that existed at the
time of the British mandate is an integral regional unit.
<strong>Article 3:</strong>The Palestinaian Arab people possesses the 
lega right to its
homeland, and when the liberation of its homeland is completed it will 
exercise self-
determination solely according to its own will and choice.
<strong>Article 4:</strong> The Palestinian personality is an innate, 
persistent
characteristic that does not disappear, and it is transferred from 
fathers to
sons. The Zionist occupation, and the dispersal of the Palestinian Arab 
people 
as a result of the disasters which came over it, do not deprive it from 
its 
Palestinian personality and affiliation and do not nullify them.
<strong>Article 5:</strong> The Palestinians are the Arab citizens who were
living permanently in Palestine until 1947, whether they were expelled 
from 
there or remained. Whoever is born to a Palestinian Arab father after this
date, within Palestine or outside it, is a Palestinian.
<strong>Article 6:</strong> Jews who were living permanently in Palestine
until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered 
Palestinians. [
For the dating of the Zionist invasion, considered to have begun in 1917].
<strong>Article 7:</strong> The Palestinian affiliation and the material, 
Spiritual
and historical tie with Palestine are permanent realities. The upbringing of
the Palestinian individual in an Arab and revolutionary fashion, the 
undertaking
of all means of forging consciousness and training the Palestinian, in order
to acquiant him profoundly with his homeland spiritually and materially, and
preparing him for the conflict and the armed struggle, as well as for the
sacrifice of his property and his life to restore his homeland, until the
liberation of all this is a national duty.
<strong>Article 8:</strong> The phase in which the people of Palestine is
living is that of natioan (<em>watani</em>) struggle for the liberation 
of 
Palestine. Therefore the contradictions among the Palestinain national forces
are of secondary order which must be suspended  in the interest of the 
fundamental contradiction between Zionism and colonialism on the one side and
the Palestinian Arab people on the other. On this basis, the Palestinian 
masses, 
whether in the homeland or in places of exile (<em>mahajir</em>), 
organizations
and individuals, comprise one national front which acts to restore Palestine
and liberate it through armed struggle.
<strong>Article 9:</strong> Armed struggle is the only way to liberate 
Palestine
and is therefore a strategy and not tactics. The Palestinian Arab people 
affirms
its absolute resolution and abiding determination to pursue the armed 
struggle
and to march forward towards the armed popular revolution, to liberate its
homeland and return to it [to maintain] its right to a natural life in 
it, and
to exercise its right of self-determination in it and sovereignty over it.
<strong>Article 10:</strong> Fedayeen action forms the nucleous of the 
popular
Palestinian war of liberation. This demands its promotion, extension and 
protection, and the mobilization of all the masses and scientific 
capacities 
of the palestinians, their organization and involvement in the armed 
Palestinian
revolution and cohesion in the national (<em>watani</em>) struggle among 
the 
various groups of the people of palestine, and between them and the Arab
masses, to guarantee the continuation of the revolution, its advancement and
victory.
<strong>Article 11:</strong> The Palestinians will have three mottoes: 
national
(<em>wataniyya</em>) unity, national (<em>qawmiyya</em>) mobilization and 
liberation.
<strong>Article 12:</strong> The Palestinian Arab people believes in Arab 
unity. In 
order to fulfill its role in realizing this, it must preserve, in this 
phase 
of its national (<em>watani</em>) struggle, its Palestinian personality and
the constituents thereof, increase consciousness of its existence and resists
any plan that tends to disintegrate or weaken it.
<strong>Article 13:</strong> Arab unity and the liberation of palestine 
are two
complementary aims. Each one paves the way for the realization of the other.
Arab unity leads to the liberation of Palestine and the liberation of 
Plaestine leads to Arab unity. Working for both goes hand in hand.
<strong>Article 14:</strong> The destiny of the Arab nation, indeed the 
very Arab
existence, depends on the destiny of the Palestine issue. The endeavour and
effort of the Arab nation to liberate Palestine follows from this connection.
The people of Palestine assumes its vanguard role in realizing this sacred
national (<em>qawmi</em>) aim.
<strong>Article 15:</strong> The liberation of Palestine, from the Arab 
viewpoint
, is a national (<em>qawmi</em>) duty to repulse the Zionist, Imperialist 
invasion from the great Arab homeland and to purge the Zionist presence 
from 
Palestine. Its full responsibility falls upon the Arab nation, peoples and
governments, wth the Palestinian Arab people at their head. For this purpose,
the Arab nation must mobilize all its military, human, material and spiritual
capacities to participate actively with the Palestinian people in the 
liberation
of Palestine. They must, especially in the present stage of armed Palestinian
revolution, grant and offer the people of Palestine all possible help and 
every
material and human support, and afford it every sure means and opportunity
enabling it to continue to assume its vanguads role in pursuing its armed
revolution until the liberation of its homeland.
<strong>Article 16:</strong> The liberation of Palestine, from a 
spiritual viewpoint,
will prepare an atmosphere of tranquillity and peace for the Holy Land in 
the 
shade of which all the Holy Places will be safeguarded, and freedom of 
worship
and visitation to all will be guaranteed, without distinction or 
discrimination
of race, color, language or religion. For this reason, the people of 
Palestine 
looks to the support of all the spiritual forces in the world.
<strong>Article 17:</strong> The liberation of Palestine, from a human 
viewpoint will
restore to the Palestinian man* his dignity, glory and freedom. For this, the
Palestinian Arab people looks to the support of those in the world who 
believe
in the dignity and freedom of man*.
<strong>Article 18:</strong> The liberation of Palestine, from an 
international viewpoint,
is a defensive act necessiated by the requirements of self-defence. For this
reason the Arab people of Palestine, desiring to befriend all peoples, 
looks 
to the support of the states which love freedom, justice and peace in 
restoring
the legal situation to Palestine, establishing security and peace in its 
territory,
and enabling its people to exercise national (<em>wataniyya</em>) 
sovereignty and
national (<em>qawmiyya</em>) freedom.
<strong>Article 19:</strong> The partition of Palestine in 1947 and the 
establishment
of Israel is fundamentally null and void, whatever time has elapsed, 
because it
was contrary to the wish of the people of Palestine and its natural right to
its homeland, and contradicts the principles embodied in the Charter of 
the UN,
the first of which is the right of self determination.
<strong>Article 20:</strong> The Balfour Declaration, the Mandate 
document, and what
has been based upon them are considered null and void. The claim of a 
historical
or spiritual tie between Jews and Palestine does not tally with historical
realities nor with the constituents of statehood in their true sense. 
Judaism,
in its character as a religion of revelation, is not a nationality with 
an 
independent existence. Likewise, the Jews are not one people with an 
independent
personality. They are rather citizens of the states to which they belong.
<strong>Article 21:</strong> The Palestinian Arab people, in expressing 
itself through the
armed Palestinian revolution, rejects every solution that is a substitute for
a complete liberation of Palestine, and rejects all plans that aim at the
settlement of the Palestine issue or its internationalization.
<strong>Article 22:</strong> Zionism is a political movement organically 
related to
world Imperialism and hostile to all movements of liberation and progress in
the world. It is a racist and fanatical movement in its formation: agressive,
expansionist and colonialist in its aims; and fascist and Nazi in its means.
Israel is the tool of the Zionist movement and a human and geographical base
for world Imperialism. It is a concentration and jumping-off point for 
Imperialism
in the heart of the Arab homeland, to strike at the hopes of the Arab nation
for liberation, unity and prograss.
<strong>Article 23:</strong> The demands of security and peace and the 
requirements
of truth and justice oblige all states that preserve friendly relations among
peoples and maintan the loyalty of citizens to their homelands to consider
Zionism an illegetimate movement and to prohibit its existence and activity.
<strong>Article 24:</strong> The alestinian Arab people believes in the 
principle of justice,
freedom, sovereignty, self-determination, human dignity and the right of 
peoples
to exercise them.
<strong>Article 25:</strong> To realize the aims of this covenant and its 
principles the
Palestine Liberation Organization will undertake its full role in liberating
Palestine.
<strong>Article 26:</strong> The Palestine Liberation Organization, which 
represents the
forces of the Palestinian revolution, is responsible for the movement of the
Palestinain Arab peole in its struggle to restore its homeland, liberate it,
return to it and exercise the right of self-determination in it. This 
responsibilty  extends to all military, political and finanacial matters, and
all else that the Palestinian issue requires in the Arab and 
international 
spheres.
<strong>Article 27:</strong> The Palestine Liberation Organization will 
cooperate with
all Arab states, each according to its capacities, and will maintain 
neutrality
in their mutual relations in the light of and on the basis of, the 
requirements
of the battle of liberation and will not interfere in the intwernal 
affairs of
any Arab State.
<strong>Article 28:</strong> The Palestinian Arab peole insists upon the 
originality
and independence of its national (<em>wataniyya</em>) revolution and rejects
every manner of interference, guardianship and subordination.
<strong>Article 29:</strong> The Palestinian Arab people posseses the 
prior and original
right in liberating and restoring its homeland and will define its 
position 
with refernce to all states and powers on the basis of their positions 
with 
reference to the issue [of Palestine] and the extent of their support for 
[the
Palestinian Arab peole] in its revolution to realize its aims.
<strong>Article 30:</strong> The fighters and bearers of arms in the 
battle of liberation
are the nucleus of the popular army, which will be the protection arm of 
the 
gains of the Palestinian Arab people.
<strong>Article 31:</strong> This organization shall have a flag, oath 
and anthem, all of
which will be determined in accordance with a special system.
<strong>Article 32:</strong> To this covenant is attached a law known as 
the fundamental
law of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in which is determined the 
manner
of the organization's formation, its committees, institutions, the special
function of every one of them and all the requisite duties associated 
with them
in accordance with this covenant.
<strong>Article 33:</strong> This covenant cannot be amended except by a 
two-thirds
majority of all the members of the National Assembly of the Palestine 
Liberation
Organization in a special session called for this purpose.<hr>
*: I believe this is a mutilated translation of the Arabic 
<em>insaan</em> which
means human-being.
