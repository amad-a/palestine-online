<h1>ADPCL: Association for the Development of Palestinian Camps in 
Lebanon</h1>
In'aash, the Arabic name of the above association, means revival but the 
actual
work of the association is more of a survival than anything else. The 
embroidery
works done there are both a step towards cultural preservation and self - 
suffiency.
After Oslo I, II, ...infinity, the cause of the Palestinian refugees has 
been 
marginalized if not eliminated even from political discussions. <br>
The info below is reproduced as received , originally from Lebanon. You 
can 
contribute by buying some of the products which, if you are familiar with 
the Palestinian embroidery (TaTriiz etc), is really cool. One picture 
that 
transmitted correctly is reproduced below. Palestine-Net.com does not 
have 
any other info apart from what you see below. Please refer all questions 
to 
the contacts within this document.<br>

<a name="about"><h2>About In'aash: Our Goals</h2>
To improve the living environment in the Palestinian refugee camps.  To
stimulate the development of women, children, and youth and motivate their
progress.  To raise the cultural, educational and economic standing of the
refugees in the Palestinian Camps in Lebanon.<p>
Since its founding in 1969, the Association has started several projects,
the expenses of which have been covered partly by generous donations but
mainly by the income generated from the marketing and selling of the
beautiful Palestinian hand embroidered products symbolized mainly by: The
Cushion.</p><p>
Our cushions are exquisitely embroidered with beautiful designs derived
from the specific patterns and motifs found on the different villagers
dresses, associated with specific Palestinian villages. Just as these
dresses, still worn today have acquired a new significance as expressions
of a Palestinian National Identity, the cushion, in its turn, has become
another symbol of a nation's National Heritage.</p><p>
In the context of a dispersed and fragmented society, in an era where
tradition and culture have become extremely precious, one means of saving
some of the values of a nation has become the preserving, reproducing and
promoting of the heritage of the Traditional Palestinian Embroidery.</p><p>
The Association for the Development of Palestinian Camps is a Lebanese
social and cultural association founded in 1969 by a group of Lebanese &amp;
Palestinian ladies. These ladies foresaw the necessity of preserving the
heritage of traditional Palestinian embroidery which would also bring
means of financial support to many needy families in the camps. Our
current projects are administered by several dedicated employees under the
guidance and advice of a group of volunteers who are usually members of
the General Assembly of the elected Board of Directors.</p></a><p><a name="about">
