Life in Palestine</em></h1>
Have you participated in the <a href="/web/20021204195827/http://palestine-net.com/about.html#vp">Visit Palestine</a> campaign?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Life in Palestine is our most recent section at
Palestine-Net. It is currently an experimental step and we hope
our visitors will like and encourage it with feedback and
suggestions.<br>
Through this section, we hope to conduct interviews with
different people especially from the Palestinian street
representing various aspects of our life. We will try to make the
interviews as random and diverse as we can (or as our abilities
and limits allow). This section will also contain occasional
pictures from Palestine.<br>
Some of the interviews will be in Arabic. If you find difficulty
viewing Arabic text, please check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021204195827/http://www.arabic2000.com/help/ehowa.html">how to read
Arabic</a> on the Internet from our other site - Arabic2000. </p>
