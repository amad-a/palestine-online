        <a name="land"><b><u>Land and
        Borders</u></b>:<br>
        Palestine, currently under occupation, is located on the
        East coast of the Miditerannean Sea, West of Jordan and
        to the south of Lebanon. The territory of Palestine
        covers around 10,435 square miles (almost same size as
        the state of Vermont in the USA - that is, pretty small.)
        [</a><a href="#note1">1</a>]<br>
        Out of this territory, there are 10,163 square miles of
        land area. The rest is water: half of the area of the
        Dead Sea (al-BaHr al-Mayyit), Huleh Lake (BuHayrat al-Huuleh)
        which was dried by the occupation and Tiberias Lake (BuHayrat
        Tabariyyah) which is also known as the Sea of Galilee (BaHr
        al-jaliil).
        <p><b><u>Topography and Terrain</u></b>:<br>
        Palestine can be divided into four main distinct regions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coastal and Inner Plains:<br>
                These are among the best fertile land in
                Palestine and elsewhere, with adequate resources
                of irrigation (from rainfall and underground
                water). They are where most of the Palestinian
                citrus groves used to stand. The coastal stretch
                is divided by Jabal al-Karmel (Mount Carmel) into
                the plain of Akka (Acre) and the plain of
                Palestine (also called Saruunah). The inner part
                consists, largely, of Marj bin 3aamir. This one
                is triangular in shape, with Jenin and Nazareth (An-NaaSirah)
                as its base and the SE edge of the Akka plain as
                its sharp corner. </li>
            <li>The Mountains and Hills:<br>
                This part is largely rocky but has terraces which
                make it suitable for a number of trees. Olives is
                one of the most planted trees in these regions.
                There are almonds, apples and others. Also, there
                are patches of plains scattered around in this
                region and these are fully utilized: they are
                planted wheat, barely, lentils .. in Winter and
                vegetables during the Summer (mostly tomatoes,
                melons, maize and other vegetation that stands
                the hot weather). Mountains are located in al-Jaliil
                (Galilee), al-Karmel, Nablus and Hebron areas. </li>
            <li>The Jordan Valley and Ghawr:<br>
                This is well below sea level, hence the name <i>ghawr</i>,
                with very good soil but very little water
                resources. Agriculture there depends on
                irrigation either from local streams or the
                Jordan River. Due to its climate, that region
                used to produce summer vegetables in late Winter
                stretching the availability of fresh produce
                before electricity and refregerators. The two
                lakes are at the northern edge of this region. </li>
            <li>The Southern Desert:<br>
                This region comprises almost half of the land of
                Palestine. It is also triangular in shape. The
                base is fertile and the rest, with its apex near
                the town of Aqaba, is poor with scattered patches
                of regions suitable for cultivation. Bi'r as-Sab'
                (renamed Beersheba by the occupation) is the main
                town in that region.[<a href="#note2">2</a>] </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b><u>Population</u></b>:<br>
        There has never been an accurate official census in
        Palestine since the roots of the recent aggression.
        Hadawi states that at the end of 1918 (WW1), there were
        700,000 people living in Palestine. These were divided
        into 574,000 Muslims, 70,000 Christians and 56,000 Jews.
        Almost all the Palestinian Christians are Arabs and most
        of the Jews as well (up to around 1900 AD). These numbers
        check positively with the estimate that only 6% to 7% of
        the total Palestinian population was Jewish right after
        the first Zionist congress in Basel. It is also
        consistent with what David Newman's statement [<a href="#note3">3</a>] that: <i>between 1800 and 1945, The
        Jewish Population of Palestine increased from
        approximately 25,000 to 600,000, eventually comprising
        some 33 per cent of the country's population.</i> </p>
