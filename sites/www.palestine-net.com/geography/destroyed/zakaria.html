<p><font size="3">[contributed , with special thanks, by village
native : Dean Adawi &lt;deandean@pe.net&gt;]</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><i>This data is taken mostly from the book </i><b><i>ALL
THAT REMAINS</i></b><i> by Walid Khalidi</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Population</b>: 1931: 742, 1945: 1180</font></p>
<p><b><u>Before 1948</u></b></p>
<p><font size="3">The village stood on undulating ground that was
underlain by soft white Eocene limestone, in the western
foothills of the Heron Mountains. It was next to the road between
Bayt Jibrin and the Jerusalem-Jafa highway. This road linked it
to other lateral roads and led to Bethlehem and a number of
villages, among them Ajjur, Dayr Al-Dubban, and Tall Al-Safi. The
village name reflected the cultural continuity of the area's
population with the Roman and Byzantine periods; the site was
called Caper Zacharia during those times and fell witin the
adminstrative jurisdiction of Bayt Jibrin. In 1596, Zakaryya was
a village in the liwa of Jerusalem, with a population of 259. It
paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, and
olives, as well as on other types of produce, such a goats and
beehives.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In the late nineteenth century, Zakariyya stood
on the slope above a broad, flat valley, surrounded by extensive
olive groves. The village had a rectangular layout and the
residents, who were Muslim, built their houses of stone and mud.
The older parts of the village were located at its center and in
its northern and southern quarters. The center consisted of a
mosque, a shrine for a Shaykh Hasan, a busy marketplace, and an n
elementary school. The village expanded on all sides in modern
times, especially to the north and south. The villagers obtained
their drinking water from tow communal wells-the al-Saflani well,
drilled next to Wadi Ajjur, and the Al-Sarara well, north of the
village. Some water also came from domestic wells that gathered
rainwater. Rainfed agriculture represented the backbone of the
economy; the main crops included grain, beans, fruit, and olives.
In 1945 a total of 6,523 dunums was allocated to cereals; 961
dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, of which 440 dunums
were planted with olive trees. The second most important
occupation of the villagers was animal husbandry. They grazed
their goats and sheep on the wild shrubs and grasses that grew on
the slopes of the hills and wadis. Near the site of the village
were many ancient localities. About 1 Km to the southwest was
Tall Zakariyya, which rises 117 m above the plain. The plain to
the east has been identified with the Valley of Elah where,
according to the Bible (1 Samuel 17), David fought Goliath. Tall
Zakariyya was excavated in 1898 and has been identified with
Azekah, a town which may have been referred to in a text written
on a broken shard that was found at Tall al-Duwayr. Azekah was
said to be the place where Joshua triumphed over the Cannanites
(Joshua 10:10)</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><u>After 1948</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Zakariyya first came under attack early in the
war in the course of the battles around the Kfar Etzion Block of
Jewish settlements south of Bethlehem. Along with Dayr Aban and
Bayt Nattif, it was besieged by a Hoganah unit estimated at 100
men by Arab sources quoted by the New York Times. "The
punitive expedition " against the villages, in retaliation
for the ambush of a Plamach shock force nearby, persisted for a
bout twenty-four hours. The times also said the Israeli forces
directed their fire at the villages on 17 and 18 January 1948.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Zakariyya was occupied over nine month later,
towards the end of operation ha-Har and Yo'av, when Isreal's
operational areas became contiguous in the last week of October
1948. Israeli units broke through at the village on 23 October
1948, linking the Israeli-held parts of the Hebron hills with the
Jerusalem corridor. Unlike most of the inhabitants of villages
conquered in these operations, the villagers were not displaced
at the item of occupation. However, Israeli historian Benny
Morris reports that over a year later, towards the end of 1949,
the Israeli military drew up a plan to evict the people of
Zakariyya, along with those of some seven other villages (mostly
in the northen Galilee). But Morris adds that "politcal
objections by the Foreign Ministry blocked implementations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Efforts to expel the people of Zakariyya was
one of the longest-lasting of these communities, despite the
"appalling" health and food situation in the village,
according to Morris. In March 1949, the Israeli Interior Minestry
official in charge of the Jerusalem District noted that "in
the village there are many good houses, and it is possible to
accommodate in them several hundred new immigrants." In
January 1950, Ben-Gurion met with his foreign minister, Moshe
Sharett, and Jewish National Fund official Yosef Weitz and
decided to evict the inhabitants of Zakariyya "(but) without
coercion." They were eventually evicted on 9 June 1950-the
means of expulsion are not mentioned-and most were transferred to
al-Ramla, with some possibly going to Jordan.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The settlement of Zekharya was established in
1950 on village land, close to the village site.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The mosque and a number of houses, some
occupied by Jewish residents and others deserted, remain on the
site. Large sections of the site itself were covered with wild
vegetations. The mosque is in a state of neglect; segments of its
walls and roof and the surrounding ground are overgrow with wild
vegetations. An Israeli flag is planted on top o the minaret. One
of the occupied houses is a two-story stone structure with a flat
roof. Its second story windows have round arches and grill work.
Parts of the surrounding land are cultivated by Israeli farmers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Many of the original inhabitants and their
descendants reside in the West Bank towns like Beit Jala, Aroub
and Duheisha camps. Also some are in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf
States, Scandinavia, and the United States</font></p>
