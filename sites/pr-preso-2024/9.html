    <h1>Web Scraping From Internet Archive</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>Palestine Online</i> sites are sourced from the Wayback Machine
        </li>
        <li>
            A goal of the archive is to have as many sites and site resources (such as images) saved for permanence of the archive, speed, offline use, stability, and full control of sites
        </li>
        <li>
            Was running into problems with existing projects and solutions to scrape Wayback Machine, decided to explore creating my own solution for the archive's needs
        </li>
        <li>
            Explored modern
        headless browser and web crawler libraries in JS - specifically <a href="https://crawlee.dev/">Crawlee</a> and
        <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>, to build an efficient and reliable scraper that would encourage the growth of the archive
