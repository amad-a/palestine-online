While she imprisoned it, she did not give the cat food or drink, nor did she free it to eat the insects of the earth.}8<br><br>He also said that a man gave a very thirsty dog a drink, so God forgave his sins for this action.&nbsp; The Prophet&nbsp; was asked, “Messenger of God, are we rewarded for kindness towards animals?”&nbsp; He said: {There is a reward for kindness to every living animal or human.}9<br><br>Additionally, while taking the life of an animal for food, Muslims are commanded to do so in a manner that causes the least amount of fright and suffering possible.&nbsp; The Prophet Muhammad&nbsp; said: {When you slaughter an animal, do so in the best way.&nbsp; One should sharpen his knife to reduce the suffering of the animal.}10 <br><br>In light of these and other Islamic texts, the act of inciting terror in the hearts of defenseless civilians, the wholesale destruction of buildings and properties, the bombing and maiming of innocent men, women, and children are all forbidden and detestable acts according to Islam and the Muslims.&nbsp; Muslims follow a religion of peace, mercy, and forgiveness, and the vast majority have nothing to do with the violent events some have associated with Muslims.&nbsp; If an individual Muslim were to commit an act of terrorism, this person would be guilty of violating the laws of Islam.</span></font></td>
