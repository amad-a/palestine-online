        On a Geocities webpage created in 2002 titled “The holly land......Palestine”, a collection of still images,
        animated gifs, and text coloured in shades of green, red, and white is overlaid on a black background. At the
        top of the page is a 3D graphic spelling out بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ in a stretched yellow font
        surrounded by two waving Palestinian Flags, and placed further down are defining scenes from the Second
        Intifada: Al Aqsa Mosque, Faris Odeh throwing rocks at IOF tanks, the killing of Muhammad al-Durrah, and Al Aqsa
        Mosque. Surrounding these visuals are links to audio recordings of the Qur’an, news websites, and “Islamic Web
        Search”.

        The emergence of the World Wide Web in the late 90s was bookended by two pivotal developments in Palestine - the
        signing of the Oslo Accords, and the second Intifada. As with the rest of the world, Palestinians were taking
        advantage of the web’s new capabilities to compile together text, images, and multimedia to express themselves
        and build new digital commons. Importantly, they also upheld their identity, history, and struggle for
        liberation, and ushered in a new era of documenting Palestinian life that set the groundwork for how they use
        the internet today in the face of ongoing occupation and genocide.

        “Palestine Online” is an ever growing time capsule of the internet Palestinians built during this early period.
        Within these websites, we find pages that interweave family photos, biographies, and hobbies, with news updates
        about the Intifada, memorials for martyrs, and maps documenting the histories of occupied villages. There is an
        abundance of educational and cultural materials, like a virtual tour of Al Aqsa, pages compiling Folklore and
        Proverbs, and tutorials for everything from Tatriz to HTML (in both English and Arabic). The project also traces
        early institutional efforts to establish a Palestinian Internet presence and infrastructure, such as at Birzeit
        University, where the first large-scale effort to compile a “complete” guide of the Palestinian websites took
        place.

        Palestine Online identifies the web as a placemaking and recordkeeping tool used by Palestinians to counteract
        the systematic denial of their physical, ancestral land via occupation, and the continued erasure and
        destruction of history to maintain this land. Some websites mark specific cities and villages in Palestine, and
        others mark structures that have been destroyed, such as the Gaza International Airport, which was bombed and
        bulldozed by the IOF in 2002.

        As the ongoing siege of Gaza is destroying historic archives like Gaza City's Municipal Public Library,
        Palestine Online aims to compile and immortalise digital histories which cannot be wiped by bombs, while also
        honouring the rich technological tradition of Palestinians skillfully carving out a space for themselves on the
        ephemeral medium through visually stunning computer generated graphics, innovative layouts, and creative
        interactive design. To me, these websites contribute to Palestinians’ continued legacy of imagining and building
        new futures for themselves, against a constant attack on these futures.
