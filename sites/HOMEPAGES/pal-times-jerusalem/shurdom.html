In a particularly run-down area of Basra,Iraq's second</P><P>largest city, formerly a thriving oil port, our van pulls up to ablock of</P><P>eight cement tri-level buildings, each a stark refuge for familieswho are</P><P>"internally displaced."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Children dressed in rags scamper barefoot across oozing mud mixedwith raw</P><P>sewage.  "Hello!  Hello!" they cry out, surrounding us, grabbingour hands,</P><P>and pulling us toward their homes.  We hear them shout, "Surah!"the Arabic</P><P>word for picture. Julie has pulled out her camera and they areeager to be</P><P>photographed.  Several children sidle up very close to me, andwhisper,</P><P>"Monies, Madame, monies."  I feel myself sliding in a pile ofslime and</P><P>realize, as the children laugh with delight, that I've misstepped. My shoes</P><P>are now caked with gooey mire.  Anxious not to trek this filthinto anyone's</P><P>home, I duck around a corner, trying to separate from the crowd. Five</P><P>youngsters join me, still beckoning me to come to their home, andwhen I</P><P>point to my shoes, they shake their heads and laugh.  They'reright.  The</P><P>sewage and slime are pervasive, inescapable,-- befouling thewater, the</P><P>ground, the homes.  Little tykes who disappeared into a nearbydark doorway</P><P>emerge moments later with two young mothers, each carrying aninfant.  The</P><P>mothers smile shyly, letting me admire their babies.  We all posefor group</P><P>photos.  </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The children's excitement and glee is irresistible, theirinnocence</P><P>overwhelming.  Have they any idea, I wonder, what dangers surroundthem?</P><P>One open cut, one infection, one parasite could turn any one ofthe kids</P><P>beaming up at me into a "statistic," a casualty of biological andeconomic</P><P>warfare. Economic sanctions now claim the lives of 5,000 to 6,000children,</P><P>every month: we're posing for pictures in a battleground.  </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Walking back to our van we meet a little boy pulling a milk crateby a</P><P>frayed rope.  Inside the crate, bundled in a muddied, raggedblanket, a baby</P><P>gazes calmly at us, undisturbed by the flies that rest on his faceand lips.</P><P>I notice his hair is reddish, a telltale sign of malnourishment. A bevy of</P><P>children smile tenderly at the youngest among them.  In the monthto come,</P><P>many people in the US and the UK will recall nativity scenescelebrating the</P><P>birth and infancy of the child Jesus.  They'd be horrified at thenotion of</P><P>a cruise missile exploding over the creche.  Most don't know thata</P><P>modern-day Herod, deadly, vengeful, and reckless,  pursues thelittle ones</P><P>of Basra, waging biological and economic warfare, whilethreatening bombing</P><P>attacks.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Each Sunday in the Christian season of Advent, churchgoersanticipate</P><P>arrival of the innocent one, born into impossible poverty, whowill bring</P><P>forth justice for the poor, liberty for captives, sight for theblind.  "O</P><P>come, O come, Emmanuel," is sung in churches worldwide.  I hearthe tune now</P><P>and feel haunted.  Is it possible, is there some dim chancethat</P><P>good-hearted care could extend to Iraqis in Basra? When I left theU.S., a</P><P>week ago, individuals and groups around the world were urgentlyresponding</P><P>to cries for help from victims of Hurricane Mitch.  A week ago, itwas o.k.</P><P>to care about Nicaragua's and Honduras's children.  This week,next week,</P><P>might it finally be o.k. to care about Iraq's children?  Insteadof</P><P>perverting the UN into an instrument of warfare that brutalizesand kills</P><P>children, might the potential to care for innocents in distressdisplace the</P><P>missiles, sanctions and media hyped hatred aimed at Iraq?  ThisChristmas,</P><P>could a new birth of compassion and love arrive on time forBasra's children?</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Voices in the Wilderness</P><P>	A Campaign to End the US/UN Economic Sanctions Against thePeople of Iraq</P><P>1460 West Carmen Ave.</P><P>Chicago, IL 60640</P><P>ph:773-784-8065; fax: 773-784-8837</P><P>email: kkelly@igc.apc.org</P><P>website: http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
