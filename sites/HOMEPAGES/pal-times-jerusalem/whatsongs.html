<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Palestinian Popular Songs</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H1>Palestinian Popular Songs</H1><P>All occasions in the Palestinian life have their own songs. Weddings are the most popular times <BR>when people sing and dance on the tunes of the popular songs. Usually there are certain singers (<BR>Zajjaleen) who lead the singing and the audience repeats after them. However, one can find <BR>people singing popular songs while working in the land or the factory.<BR>As any other form of poetry, popular songs treat different aspects: love, patriotism, wisdom, and <BR>others. In addition, there are different forms of songs which differ in the tune and the way of <BR>singing as will be seen below. Most of the songs introduced in this section are men's songs in <BR>addition to the most popular women's song (Zaghareet). However, this does not mean that women <BR>do not contribute to the Palestinian folklore. Mr. Sa'ood Al-Asadi said, &quot;The Palestinian folklore is a <BR>common excellence of women and men.&quot;<BR>There are several popular bands and singers (Zajjaleen) who are the main source of energy for the <BR>revival of our popular songs. To list some: The Popular Palestinian Arts Band in Ramallah, Ghassan <BR>Kanafani's Band for Dabka in Bethlehem University, Jafra Band in Ramallah, and JuThoor (Roots) <BR>Band in Bir Zeit University. There are also Islamic Art bands who introduced the Islamic concepts <BR>to the popular songs, such as: Yarmouk Band (Jordan), AS-Sakhra Band (USA), and Ar-rawaby <BR>Band (Jordan). As far as popular singers, one can find at least one in every village or town in <BR>Palestine. To list some: Rajeh As-salfeety (died in 1990), Hammoudeh Al-farkhaawy (Abu Bashir), <BR>Ibrahim Al-'arrany (Abu Bassam), Awni Barghouthi, Amjad Arar, Mousa Hafeth, Mithqal Al-<BR>jayyousy, and Muhareb Theeb (Rababah singer).<BR>Few points must be added before going through the examples and forms of songs:<BR>1. Eventhough these are men's songs, women may also use the same forms where they may change <BR>the tune or the contents of the songs.<BR>2. The samples are written in the Palestinian dialect where I used (.gif) files for the Arabic script. I <BR>also added transliteration and translation of most of the samples.<BR>Forms of Songs:<BR>'Ataba<BR>Dal'ona<BR>Zareef eT-Tool<BR>Sahja/Saamir<BR>Zajal<BR>Zaghareet<P>References: <BR>1.Abu Hadba, A.: Interview with Sa'ood Al-Asadi, Society &amp; Heritage, 24: 192, al-Bireh, Palestine (July <BR>1994). <BR>2.Barghouthi, A.: Arabic Popular Songs in Palestine and Jordan, Bir Zeit University, Bir Zeit, Palestine <BR>(1979). <BR>3.Barghouthi, A.: Chronicle of Palestinian 'Ataba, Bir Zeit University, Bir Zeit, Palestine (1986). <BR>4.Barghouthi, A.: Chronicle of Palestinian Dal'ona, Bir Zeit University, Bir Zeit, Palestine (1990). <P>'Ataba<BR>'Ataba is the most popular song in Palestine. You can hear farmers, workers, and shepherds singing 'ataba <BR>while they are doing their jobs. However, weddings are the main environment for the songs.<BR>As with the other forms of songs, 'ataba deals with all the subjects of poetry.<BR>Usually, the singer starts with the long sound of (Ooaaaff) then the verses of 'ataba follow. 'Ataba is composed <BR>of four verses of poetry. The first three end with the same word in sound but different meanings. The fourth <BR>verse ends with a word that usually ends with a sound like (aab, awa...)<P>Dal'ona<BR>Second to 'ataba, dal'ona is the most popular song. It is easier to compose a dal'ona song than 'ataba because <BR>it does not require the similar sound of the ends of the first three verses. However, like 'ataba, dal'ona has four <BR>verses of poetry where the first three have similar endings and the fourth usually ends with a sound like (oana<BR>).<BR>Dal'ona is the song of the Palestinian popular dance, dabka, where the dancers sing it along with the sound of <BR>shubbabah (flute), yarghool, or mijwiz. <P>Zareef eT-Tool<BR>Zareef eT-Tool has a fair popularity and it is also used in dabka. Of course, the tune is differet from dal'ona. <P>Sahja/Saamir<BR>This is a popular song in weddings where people stand in two lines facing each other and sing. One line of <BR>people sings a verse and the other line repeats the same verse. Sometimes, the second line starts a new verse <BR>and changes the order of the flow of the song. <P>Zajal<BR>Zajal is usually performed by a singer who makes up the song on the spot. Those singers (one is zajjal) are <BR>professionals in singing and people invite them to sing in weddings and most of them get paid for singing. The <BR>audience will follow the zajjal with whatever songs he sings. <P>Zaghareet<BR>Zaghareet (one is zaghroot)are the most popular women songs which can be compared to the men's 'ataba. <BR>The way a woman sings this form is that she starts with a loud (heey eeeh) or (Aweeeha) sound, then the words <BR>follow. When the woman says the last word the rest of the women join with a loud (lololololololeeeeey) sound. <BR>There are other forms of women songs, but the lack of resources caused me to only mention this <P><HR><EM>Original file name:  What are the songs? - converted on Thursday, 10 April 1997, 17:20 </EM><P><EM>This page was created using TextToHTML.
