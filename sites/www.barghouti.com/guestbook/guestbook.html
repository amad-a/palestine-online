Don't know if any one remembers me .. oh! there he is ,I miss Hanthalah .
Who isn't Hanthala. It's time to get rid of your leader.
You have a fresh country..you can shape it as you like . Why don't you-the
Palestenians- take it in your hands and find another leader ..Other than
this "Assasin"..who took the presious life of "Naji" and The beloved
