    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">He called for
    shunning American pressures and for not expediting fruits of the intifada,
    recalling that when that was done in the previous intifada the fruit was the
    Oslo agreement that divided the people.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Mousa
    affirmed importance of drawing a strategic plan by all national and Islamic
    forces in which all would abide by the minimum demand of expelling
    occupation beyond the 1967 borders. He advocated the formation of an
    intifada government to shoulder the political responsibility and the

    number of Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, leaders have stressed the
    importance of continuation of resistance against occupation, regardless of
    any pressures, combat of corruption and prosecution of collaborators.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Dr. Mahmoud
    Al-Zahhar, addressing the seminar organized by Hamas on Thursday, said that
    the Palestinian people had no other option but resistance after failure of
    the negotiations. He said that the Palestinian Authority had the greater
    responsibility in fighting corruption.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Hamas would
    support the Palestinian state if it was a step towards liberation of the
    whole of Palestine, he affirmed.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">For his part,
    Dr. Abdul Aziz Ranteesi said that Hamas was insisting on its decision not to
    get involved in side battles with the PA, pointing out that result of any
    such confrontation would be complete loss.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">He affirmed,
    meanwhile, seriousness of the phenomenon of collaborators, adding that Hamas
    would not prosecute those agents as long as the PA was responsible for law
    and order.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Ranteesi,
    however, noted that his Movement did not prefer seasonal prosecution of
    collaborators but rather supported a strategic plan to fight such a
    phenomenon.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Sheikh Ismail
    Hanneya underlined that the Zionist entity had forged agreements with Arab
    regimes and not peoples who rejected them and cited in this respect the Arab
    popular support of the Palestinian intifada.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">He called for
    protecting the intifada through rejecting negotiations and arming the
    Palestinian people especially those near to Jewish settlements or Zionist
    army barracks in addition to providing necessary economic backing.</p>

    the Jewish day of rest, but both sides downplayed prospects of an early
    agreement.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">PA official
    Ahmed Qrei, who heads the Palestinian team to the talks, pointed out that it
    was difficult to reach an agreement due to the wide gaps between the two
    sides over such fundamental issues as the borders, the refugees and Alquds.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Palestinian
    sources at Taba indicated that in light of the continuing deadlock over the
    said issues, it was likely the two sides would conclude the current round of
    negotiations o Sunday or Monday with a joint statement stressing that
    progress was being made and that the momentum for further progress would
    have to be maintained.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">However, the

    during a televised interview last night, Qrei also warned that the peace
    process as a whole would face a real problem if Israelis elected Ariel

    Jordan against putting up a strong resistance to normalization, arguing that
    this “would undermine Jordan’s economic interests.”</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">However, one
    professional union member reportedly retorted to the minister saying “what
    does make you think that our perceived economic interests are more precious
    than the blood of our children which is being shed by Israeli soldiers.”</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The Israeli

    An official with the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Sheikh. Ismail
    Hanneya has condemned recent statements of the fanatic Jewish party Shas’
    mentor the Rabbi Ovadia Yossef in which he described Arabs and Palestinians
    as worse than snakes.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">He affirmed
    that the statement showed the extent of Jewish mean psyche and inherent
    spite against Arabs and Muslims, pointing out that the Palestinian people as
    part of the Islamic Nation were praised in the holy Quran “Ye are the best
    of Peoples, evolved for mankind, …”</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Hanneya said
    that the rabbi’s terrorist statement exposed reality of the Jews and
    called on the Palestinian people not to be deceived by the so-called peace
    and co-existence with them.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
    statements further revealed that the conflict with Jews was a civilization
    one with ideological and creed dimensions, he elaborated.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The Hamas
    leader said that the best retaliation to such statements was sticking to
    struggle and Jihad to expel all such fanatics from the occupied homeland.</p>

    Agreements not including right of return null and void<o:p>

    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Nablus-</b>
    Sheikh Hamed Beitawi, head of the league of Palestine Ulama (religious
    scholars) has affirmed that any agreement not including the refugees’
    right of return was null and void.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The Sheikh,
    in his Friday sermon yesterday, said that the Palestinian people would
    continue their Jihad against the Zionists until the dream of return was
    actualized.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The true
    settlement of the refugees’ question was not through compensations or
    resettlement but rather through the return of millions of refugees who were
    forcibly evacuated from their homes whether in 1948 or 1967, Beitawi
    asserted.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The chief of
    Palestine Ulama held the Hebrew state, government, parties and people,
    responsible for the refugees’ ordeal and their expulsion. He also held the
    so-called new world order the responsibility for allowing such an ordeal to
    take place.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Beitawi
    affirmed that it was forbidden for any Palestinian to leave his homeland
    regardless of all forms of oppression practiced on him/her by the occupation
    authorities.</p>
