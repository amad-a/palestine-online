          Massacre of Dawayma<br>
          29 October 1948</font></b><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">One of the worst but best-documented massacres
          during the offensive took place at Dawayma. This town was taken by a
          company of the 89th Commando Battalion which was composed of former
          Irgun and Stern Gang terrorists. A veteran of the unit has published
          an account of the massacre. He notes that in order ‘to kill the
          children they fractured their heads with sticks. There was not one
          house without corpses.’ After murdering the children, the Jewish
          soldiers herded the women and men into houses. where they were kept
          without food or water. Then the houses were blown up with the helpless
          civilians inside.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The Israelis were particularly sadistic in their
          treatment of Arab women. One Zionist soldier in Dawayma, ‘prided
          himself upon having raped an Arab woman before shooting her to death.
          Another Arab woman with her newborn baby was made to clean the place
          for a couple of days and then they shot her and her baby.’ The
          conscience-stricken Israeli veteran who revealed these events stressed
          that they were committed by ‘Educated and well-mannered commanders
          who were considered good guys.’ They became ‘base murderers and
          this was not in the storm of battle but as a method of expulsion and
          extermination. The fewer the Arabs who remained, the better.’<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">At the end of the offensive on the southern
          front, the UN requested that the Israelis allow a team of observers to
          visit Dawayma to investigate Egyptian charges that a massacre had
          taken place there. After three previous requests were denied, on 8
          November the Israelis finally allowed Colonel Sore and Warrant-Officer
          Van Wassenhove to visit the village. As he walked through the town,
          the Belgian Van Wassenhove saw that many of the houses were still
          smoking. Some of these houses, the Belgian officer noted, ‘gave a
          peculiar smell as if bones were burning.’ But he was not allowed by
          the Israeli officer to investigate further. When he asked about a
          house which was about to be blown up, Van Wassenhove was told ‘The
          house has vermin in it and that's why we are blowing it up.’<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The UN team requested to see the village mosque
          in Dawayma but an Israeli officer replied, ‘we never go into the
          mosque because this is not correct and we must follow tradition in
          such things.’ But when the UN officials did get a brief look inside
          they found that there were quite a few Jewish soldiers in the Islamic
          holy place, which had obviously been desecrated.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Sore and Van Wassenhove wanted to see the other
          side of the village, where they suspected there might be more
          incriminating evidence. The Israelis would not let the UN team go
          there because they claimed that the area was mined. But Van Wassenhove
          remarked, ‘I haven't noticed any place where there could be mines or
          where mines could have been taken out.’ He also observed that the
          road that the Israelis claimed had been mined by the Arabs faced the
          Arab lines, which is not the side of the village where mines would be
          placed.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">When Sore and Van Wassenhove asked about the
          evacuation of the village by its inhabitants, they were told that the
          whole population had fled when the Arab forces left the region. The
          Israelis denied that they had used force to expel the villagers but
          they were greatly disturbed when the UN observers came upon the body
          of an Arab civilian and they refused to allow Sore and Van Wassenhove
          to examine it. Despite the hostile attitude of the Israelis, the UN
          team had little doubt about what had taken place at Dawayma.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The American Consul in Jerusalem, William
          Burdett, had heard about the visit of the UN team to Dawayma. After
          making inquiries, on 16 November, he reported to Washington,
          ‘Investigation by UN indicates massacre occurred but observers are
          unable to determine number of persons involved.’ Estimates vary
          considerably but probably about 300 Arab civilians were slaughteredin
          the town.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Members of the Israeli government knew what had
          happened at Dawayma and other towns in the Negev but most were
          unconcerned. However, one Israeli leader had a conscience. On 17
          November, Agriculture Minister Aharon Cizling told the Cabinet, ‘I
          feel that things are going on which are hurting my soul, the soul of
          my family and all of us here.’ Probably referring to Dawayma, he
          added, ‘Jews too have behaved like Nazis and my entire being has
          been shaken.’<o:p>

          Massacre of Kafr Kassim<br>
          29 October 1956</b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The aftermath of Kibya was a continued, and still
          continuing, Zionist policy of perpetrating massacres to serve the
          political purpose of the Zionist clique. In 1956, they joined in a
          conspiracy with the British and French to invade Egypt. The conspiracy
          to commit aggressive war was accompanied by atrocities against
          innocent civilians.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Although the defenseless Arab population in
          Zionist-occupied Palestine posed no military threat to the Zionist
          Defence Forces, the Zionists feared the emotional arousal that would
          inevitably accompany their waging of a new, aggressive war. They
          decided to instill total fear in the hearts of the helpless
          Palestinian Arab communities, and selected the peaceful village of
          Kafr Kassim to perpetrate a cold-blooded massacre. Fifty one men,
          women and children were murdered on October 29, 1956, by the Frontier
          Guard Force.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">According to the precedents established by the
          Intemational War Crimes Tribunals, not only the Zionist Frontier Force
          personnel involved were guilty of this heinous war crime, but also the
          officials who gave them orders to impose rigid curfews without
          simultaneously insuring that noncombatants were unharmed.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Because the Kafr Kassim Massacre took place
          during a time of war, the then Chief of Staff, General Moshe Dayan,
          and the then Chief of Operations of the IDF, General Meir Amit, had
          direct command responsibility for the actions of the Zionist Frontier
          Force.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Beneath them, Israeli court records disclose,
          command responsibility was also held by the Commander of the IDF
          Central Area, Major General Zvi Tsur; Frontier Guard commander
          Brigadier Yehishkar Shadmi; and the Commander of the unit perpetrating
          the massacre, Major Shmuel Melinki; Lieutenant Dahan, Sergeant Shalom
          Ofer, Private Makhlouf Hreish, Private Eliahu Abraham, Corporal
          Gabriel Olial, Private Albert Fahimi and Private Edmond Nahmani.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">They should all have been hanged for their roles
          in the massacre in the same way German Generals such as Keitel and
          Jodl were hanged for their failures to prevent massacres in commands
          under their responsibility.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion was culpable
          under international law because it was his responsibility to establish
          rules for maintaining order in territory under his control. This
          responsibility was also directly borne by his personal delegate in the
          Defense Ministry, the then Director General of the Ministry of Defence,
          Shimon Peres. Peres cannot plead ignorance to what was taking place at
          Kafr Kassim; it was his duty to be informed of possible war crimes and
          to prevent their occurrence.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The following is a detailed account of the
          horrible massacre of Kafr Kassim as told by eyewitnesses:<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The Israeli daily, Kol Haam came out on
          Wednesday, December 19, carrying on its front page the following
          detailed story of the Kafr Kassim massacre which was committed by the
          Israeli army on October 29, 1956, against the Arabs in occupied
          Palestine and in which 49 people - men, women and children - were
          slaughtered in cold blood.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Kol Haam published the story of the massacre
          under the title, “ In This Way Were the 49 Inhabitants of Kafr
          Kassim Slaughtered”. The following is a literal translation:<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Here are the details of the massacre in which 49
          of the peaceful inhabitants of Kafr Kassim - all Arabs living in
          Israel - were slaughtered in cold blood. Another thirteen of these
          inhabitants also sustained serious injuries in this horrible massacre
          committed by the troops of the Israeli frontier guards.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">On October 29, 1956, the day on which Israel
          launched its assault on Egypt, units of the Israeli frontier guards
          started at 4 p.rn. what they called a tour of the Triangle Villages.
          They informed the Mukhtars and the rural councils that the curfew in
          those villages was from that day onwards to be observed from 5 p.m.
          instead of 6 p.m. as was the case before, and that the inhabitants
          were, therefore, requested to stay home as from that very instant.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">One of the villages the frontier guards passed
          through was Kafr Kassim. This is a small Arab village situated near
          the Israeli settlement of Betah Tefka. The villagers there received
          the alert at 4:45 p.m., only 15 minutes before the new curfew time.
          The “Mukhtar” of Kafr Kassim promptly informed the unit officer
          that a large number of the villagers, whose work took them outside the
          village, knew nothing of this new curfew. The officer in charge
          replied that his soldiers would take care of these. The villagers who
          were home complied with the newly-imposed curfew and remained indoors.
          Meanwhile, the armed frontier guards posted themselves at the village
          gates. Before long, the first batch of villagers came into sight. The
          first to arrive was a group of four laborers, home-bound, on bicycles.
          Here is what one of these laborers, Abdullah Samir Bedir by name, said
          about the incident:</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">“We reached the village entrance at about 4:55
          p.m. We were suddenly confronted by a frontier unit consisting of 12
          men and an officer, all occupying an army truck. We greeted the
          officer in Hebrew saying ‘Shalom Katsin’ which means ‘Peace be
          unto you officer,’ to which he gave no reply. He then asked us in
          Arabic: ‘Are you happy?’ and we said ‘Yes.’ The soldiers
          started stepping down from the truck and the officer ordered us to
          line up. Then he shouted to his soldiers this order: ‘Laktasour Otem,’
          which means ‘Reap them!’ The soldiers opened fire, but by then I
          had flung myself on the ground, and started rolling, yelling as I
          rolled over. Then I feigned death. Meanwhile, the soldiers had so
          riddled the bodies of my three friends with bullets that the officer
          in charge ordered them to cease firing, adding that the bullets were
          merely being wasted. As he put it, we had more than the necessary dose
          of those deadly bullets.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">“All this occurred while I lay very still,
          feigning death. Then I saw three laborers approaching on a small horse
          cart. The soldiers stopped the cart and killed all three of them. Soon
          after, the soldiers moved a few yards down the road, apparently to
          take up positions that would enable them to stop a new truckload of
          home-bound villagers, as well as a bunch of workers returning home on
          their bicycles. I seized this opportunity and moved as quickly as I
          could to the nearest house. The soldiers saw me and opened fire; but I
          was already in safety.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">“One of the trucks used for transporting farm
          produce was again stopped while carrying thirteen olive pickers, all
          women and girls, and two male laborers and the driver. They were
          attacked by the same group of frontier guards, who pitilessly
          butchered all but one of them.”<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">This is what 16-year-old Hanna Soliman Amer, the
          only survivor, said about this incident:<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">“The soldiers brought our car to a halt at the
          entrance of the village and ordered the two workers and the driver to
          step down. Then they told them they were going to be killed. On
          hearing that the women started crying and screaming, begging the
          soldiers to spare those poor workers' lives. But the soldiers shouted
          at the women, saying that their turn was coming and that they, too,
          were going to be killed.”<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">“The soldiers stared at the women for a few
          moments, as if waiting for their officer to give the order. Then I
          heard the officer talk over the wireless set, apparently asking his
          headquarters for instructions regarding the women. The minute the
          wireless conversation was over, the soldiers took aim at the women and
          girls, who were 13 in number, and who included pregnant ones (Fatma
          Dawoud Sarsour was in her eighth month of pregnancy) as well as an old
          woman of sixty and two thirteen-year old girls (LatifaEissa and
          Rashika Bedair).”<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The number of cars stopped by the Israeli
          soldiers of the frontier guards was three; the people in all three
          cars were ordered to descend and were shot by machine-gun fire,
          killing them instantly.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">A fourth car, which was a little late in coming,
          met with better luck, for the driver, seeing the bodies scattered
          around, didn't heed the order to stop. He pressed the accelerator and
          thus managed to escape with his car. The soldiers, however, succeeded
          in shooting one of the passengers as the car sped by.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">With the massacre practically over, the soldiers
          moved around finishing off whoever still had a pulse beating in him.
          Later on, the examination of these bodies showed that the soldiers had
          mutilated them, smashing the heads and cutting open the abdomens of
          some of the wounded women to finish them off. The only survivors were
          those who for some time lay buried under the corpses of their comrades
          and thus had their bodies covered with the blood of these victims,
          giving the impression that they, too, were dead. Those were the only
          ones who lived to speak of the horrors of the massacre of Kafr Kassim.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The massacre lasted for an hour and a half and
          the soldiers looted whatever they could find, apparently while going
          round the bodies doing their finishing-off job. However, thirteen of
          those wretched people only fainted when they were shot at. These were
          taken to Bilinson as well as to other hospitals.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">One of those wounded was Osman Selim, who was
          travelling on one of the trucks. He witnessed the massacre, and
          escaped by pretending to be dead among the pile of corpses. Asaad
          Selim, a cyclist, was seriously injured. So was Abdel Rahman Yacoub
          Sarsoura, a youth aged 16, who is deaf and dumb. The only one who
          managed to escape death and reach Krourn EI-Zeitoun is Ismail Akab
          Badeera, aged 18, who nursed his wounds until he got there, then
          climbing up an olive tree despite his suffering. He remained there for
          two whole days until a passing shepherd came along and carried him to
          a hospital where one of his legs had to be amputated for gangrene.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The blood bath was not restricted to the entrance
          or outskirts, but was carried right into the village itself. Talal
          Shaker Eissa, aged 8, left his home to bring in a flock of goats. He
          had hardly stepped out of his home when he was murdered by a shot
          fired by one of the soldiers. When his father ran out to investigate,
          he was killed by another shot. The mother, dragging in his body, was
          then shot. Noura, the remaining child, followed the cries of agony
          coming from her parents, and was killed on the spot by a hail of
          bullets. The only survivor of the family, a frail and aged
          grandfather, hearing the horror and the sounds of death, succumbed to
          a heart attack and died.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The next day, 31 October, 1956, a curfew was
          imposed on the village of Kafr Kassim, and during that time, the
          Israeli police brought over some of the villagers from neighbouring
          Galgoulia and ordered them to bury the corpses, which included
          fathers, mothers, sons and daughters. Among these were Safa Abdalla
          Sarsour, a woman aged 45, who was killed with her two sons, Jiliad,
          16, and Abdalla, 14. Osman Abdalla Eissa was killed with his son Fathi
          aged 12; and Zeinab Abdel Rahman Talia and her daughter Bikria, aged
          17.<o:p>
