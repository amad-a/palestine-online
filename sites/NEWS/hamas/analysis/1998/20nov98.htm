    Agreement: Between its Signing and its Application</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Wye Plantation agreement, signed on 23 October 1998, was signed
    after 18 months of Palestinian-Israeli compromise and as a result of the intense efforts
    by the American envoy to the Middle East in several meetings between the American
    Secretary of State, Arafat and Netanyahu. The agreement was also the outcome of an
    intensive nine-day-long series of negotiations held at Wye Plantation in Washington, D.C.
    With the effective participation of the American President, Bill Clinton, the agreement
    was reached after the Palestinians adopted the Israeli proposal concerning redeployment,
    also known as the &quot;10+3&quot; plan. This proposal was also adopted by the Americans
    after Netanyahu's cabinet rejected the initial American proposal of a 13% redeployment of
    the occupied West Bank. Consequently, the negotiations at Wye Plantation concentrated
    mainly upon issues of security, in addition to other matters relating to the
    ‘transitional period’, such as the Palestinian airport, the seaport, the safe
    passages, the release of prisoners held in Israeli jails, the amendment of the Palestinian
    National Charter and various other economic issues.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">American Pressure, Palestinian Submission
    and the Limited Israeli Response</font></b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Ori Safir, one of the architects of the Oslo Agreement, and the
    Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Labour Party described the Wye
    agreement as an American-Palestinian agreement, he was absolutely right, especially in
    regards to the obvious and effectual role played by the Americans in the formulation of
    the terms of the security plan. These terms must first be presented to the CIA, who will
    receive a daily report about the security procedures carried out by the PA, who has put
    all its confidence in the American ability to exert pressure upon Israel to fulfil their
    obligations. The American Government, in particular President Clinton, is very concerned
    with the realization of the Wye agreement regardless of its contents. To this end, it has
    pushed Arafat to give into all Israeli demands, without forcing Netanyahu to give anything
    substantial in return. Instead of working to ensure that the agreement is tenable, the
    American Government has been busy with the sex scandals of their President and the
    election of the States’ governors. The Democratic Party itself has been busy
    presenting their achievements to the American public in order to guarantee another
    presidential term in the year 2000 for both President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore,
    who participated in signing the agreement, although he has had little to do with the whole
    affair. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Netanyahu himself threatened to create more problems between the
    Israelis and the Palestinians and he had to be pushed by Clinton into accepting the
    proposal. Realizing that the Americans were unable to exert any real pressure upon him,
    Netanyahu attempted to gain even more advantages from the agreement by insisting that the
    CIA play a significant role in controlling the PA security systems in accordance with
    Israeli interests. This is because Israel cannot perform the same role, as to do so would
    cause considerable tension between the Israelis and the PA. Netanyahu has also succeeded
    in getting the American Government to promise to give Israel the right to decide the area
    for the third plan regarding redeployment. To this end, the American’s have signed a
    partial agreement and they have also endorsed a number of issues for negotiation in the
    later stages of the peace process. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon after the Wye Agreement, Israel signed a further strategic
    cooperation agreement with America in order to improve Israeli defense capabilities
    especially against attacks from nuclear weapons. The agreement also ensures that Israel
    will receive direct and immediate aid, if and when they are attacked by countries that are
    known to have nuclear capabilities, such as Iran, Syria and Iraq. This is considered to be
    a remarkable addition to the strategic agreement signed by Israel and the USA as a result
    of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of 1981. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to Netanyahu, the Wye agreement has realized most of his
    demands, especially in relation to security issues. The agreement was signed despite the
    objections of the Israeli Rightists who have accused Netanyahu of treason, just as they
    accused Rabin before him. However, Netanyahu has prepared for this hostility with the
    appointment of Sharon as the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs. He himself participated
    in the Wye Plantation negotiations and supported Netanyahu's position. However, because
    Sharon is from the extremist Right, it is difficult for the Israeli Rightists to object to
    his position regarding Wye because of his well-known hostility towards the Palestinians. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the PA, by adopting the American position, which is
    dedicated to solving all of the problems of the transitional period by any means
    necessary, especially the redeployment of 13% of the West Bank land, the PA have given in
    to a great deal while receiving little in return. The most pressing factor for the
    Palestinians was the realization of some kind of achievement concerning land for the
    Palestinians, as this was essential to justify compliance with the Oslo Agreement, which
    has received sharp criticism due to its impracticality. In addition, the deteriorating
    position of the PA has led them to fear that Netanyahu would cancel the agreement and
    reclaim Palestinian territories. To this end, the PA pleaded with the USA to do everything
    necessary to press Netanyahu into complying with the agreement.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">The Items of the Agreement</font></b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Wye Agreement dealt with the issues of redeployment, security and
    the previously suspended arrangements concerning the transitional period, such as the
    airport, the seaport, the industrial zone, safe passage, Israeli-held prisoners, legal and
    economic coordination and the permanent compromise talks, as well as the so-called
    unilateral activities. Most of the terms of the agreement concentrated upon security
    issues, thus redeployment has been made dependent upon whether the PA could achieve
    acceptable levels of security within 12 weeks, followed by a 3-month programme of
    activities with the objective of eradicating all types of terrorism as well as its
    infrastructure. This was to be achieved through the blanket arrests of all suspects and
    their presentation before the courts, under the supervision of the CIA and through
    coordination with the Israelis. In addition, there was to be an exchange of information
    concerning security matters with full cooperation, a prevention of all types of agitation,
    the control of all the armed groups, confiscation of all arms and weapons and the control
    of all arms smuggling, as well as the reduction in the numbers of PA policemen. The
    agreement has also classified the first and second stages of redeployment, which have been
    consolidated into one stage with three steps or ‘pulses’, all of which depend
    upon the extent to which the PA can comply with the security demands. <u><b>Consequently,
    the redeployment will transfer 12% of area C to area B, including a development of 3% of
    this land into a nature reserve; then 15.2% of areas C and B will be transferred to area A
    so that eventually the PA will have complete control over 18.2%. In area A, 21.8% will
    also be controlled by the PA with the exception of security; in area B, 60% will be
    totally controlled by Israel-C.</b></u> This should all take place within the first three
    weeks, and thus in reality the PA will control less than 20% of the West Bank, which is
    approximately 4% of Palestine. It is noticeable that Israel has not presented any charts
    for the redeployment plan, rather it seems that Israel is keeping this a secret for their
    own goals and interests. These charts were presented to the Israeli Cabinet for approval,
    and the Cabinet has insisted that the realization of each ‘pulse’ of the
    agreement is conditional on receiving the prior consent of the Cabinet, and that all the
    charts must be considered and studied by a special committee of Ministers.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regards to the third stage of the redeployment, the Wye agreement
    suggested that an Israeli-American committee should be formed to discuss this matter in
    the light of the letter presented by Warren Christopher, the American ex-Secretary of
    State, enclosed in the Hebron Agreement, which granted to Israel the right to determine
    the area of redeployment. The meeting held by the Israeli Cabinet, which approved the Wye
    Plantation agreement, was evidence of this fact when the third stage of redeployment was
    determined for only a 1% area of land. The inauguration of the northern pass, which would
    connect Gaza with the northern part of the West Bank, was postponed and is to be dealt
    with during later negotiations, which will also include discussion of the seaport, and the
    economic and legal issues. Little was said on the issue of Israeli prisoners although
    there was an oral agreement to release 750 prisoners over a period of time, unless they
    have been involved in operations against the Israelis, or if they belong to the
    organizations of HAMAS or Al-Jihad Al-Islami.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Wye agreement, the PA is required to permanently amend
    the Palestinian Charter through a series of sessions held by the Executive Committee and
    the Central Council, which must eventually be approved by both the PLO and the PA. On the
    other hand, the agreement does not oblige Israel to stop building new settlements or to
    stop expanding the existing ones. The most that has been said, in some letters sent by
    America to both Israel and the PA, is that there should be a cessation of unilateral
    procedures, indicating that the U.S. does not approve of either a unilateral declaration
    of an independent Palestinian State or the building of new settlements by the Israelis. It
    has also been decided that the permanent compromise negotiations should begin as soon as
    possible, even before the transitional compromise negotiations have been resolved. This
    has been the objective of Netanyahu even though it is something that is comprehensively
    rejected by the PA, as it is believed that it will destabilize the situation and thus make
    the PA less powerful.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any study of the Wye agreement shows that it is in reality a security
    agreement for the benefit of Israel, and this can also be seen through the reactions of
    Israel, the PA, the Arabs and the world in general.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The Wye agreement is not a new agreement but rather it is a
    continuation of the Oslo Agreement. However, it can be considered as a basis for security
    procedures, agreement upon which has come to control the success of any agreements between
    the Israelis and the PA, and which the PA itself has little control over. Security has
    always been the core of the Oslo Agreement, although until the Wye agreement it was seen
    as a general issue, whereas now it is given much more importance, being supervised by the
    CIA through bilateral Israeli-Palestinian coordination as well as tri-lateral
    Israeli-Palestinian-American coordination.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The Wye agreement also suggested that there should be further
    meetings regarding what has been approved at Wye, because although it does not include any
    new issues, it has changed some matters relating to the area of redeployment, including
    the development of a nature reserve, acceptance of the CIA as a partner to supervise the
    PA’s efforts regarding security pledges and a new phase of voting with the objective
    of abolishing the National Palestinian Charter.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The Wye agreement did not cover all issues despite the wishes of the
    PA. It contains nothing regarding the third stage of redeployment, while other issues have
    been postponed, such as the seaport, the northern safe passage and the civil, legal and
    economic issues.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. The agreement went above and beyond the main reason for the meeting
    at Wye Plantation, which had initially been the delays to the peace process caused by the
    continuous policy of the Israelis regarding the building of new settlements and the
    expansion of existing ones, such as at Abu Ghneim. However, Palestinian objections to such
    a policy ended in a remarkable bid to resume the negotiations, which can be seen as yet
    another victory for Netanyahu and his determination to suppress the existence of
    Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Starting negotiations for the final solution before issues relating
    to the transitional phase indicate that these issues will be delayed, which will
    consequently have negative results for the Palestinians, while the Israelis will continue
    to insist upon the resolution of current issues and the continued postponement of the
    delayed issues. This will make the PA’s position weaker and even more fragile.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. The Wye agreement shows that Netanyahu is attempting to put an end
    to Israeli isolation by appearing to be keen to realize a permanent compromise with the
    Palestinians, while at the same time refusing to give into any of the PA demands, except
    regarding the issue of redeployment, to which they have attached unbearable conditions,
    which the PA may not be able to fulfil and which will consequently become a direct
    obstacle to the peace process. Generally speaking, Clinton has benefited a great deal from
    the signing of the Wye agreement because it has deflected attention from his domestic and
    personal issues. In reality, the only loser is the PA because it has given in on so many
    issues while at the same time it has taken on heavy responsibilities relating to the
    success of the agreement. This will inevitably threaten the cohesion of Palestinian unity
    and may cause other Arab countries to cease their support and the payment of subsidies to
    the PLO due to the negative responses of some Arab countries to the agreement.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. In addition, the dignity of the PA has been undermined through the
    allowing of the CIA to supervise the security plans of the PA, which indicates that the PA
    is seen as being solely responsible for any security infringements while Israel remains
    blameless.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">Doubts concerning the application of the
    Wye agreement</font></b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resistance organizations will almost certainly continue in their
    campaigns against the current peace process because the agreement is no different from
    previous agreements, especially regarding the submissive position of the PA and the focus
    on security issues. The Wye agreement was signed as a result of American pressure on both
    the Israelis and the PA. Even so, Netanyahu has tried to evade implementation of some of
    the aspects of the agreement by emphasizing the failure of the PA to fulfil their
    undertakings regarding the security issues, which indeed seem impossible for the PA to
    carry out successfully. All of these matters cast several doubts upon the viability of the
    agreement as well as its practicality, primarily because of the stance taken by Netanyahu
    as well as the reaction of the Israeli Cabinet to the agreement. The new additions to the
    Wye agreement, such as the approval of the National Council with a majority of two-thirds
    of the votes, realizing each stage of redeployment separately, and building more
    settlements such as at Abu Ghneim, along with the exclusion to date of matters concerning
    Jerusalem, have in reality added more complications than it has solved. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most dangerous item of the agreement is the deprivation from the
    Palestinians of their only source of power, which lies in resistance to the Israelis,
    after the end of the Intifadah and the waning support from the former Soviet Union since
    the early 1990s. This deprivation of the right to resistance on the one hand removes the
    negative effects of any such resistance for the political elite in Israel who have been
    competing to claim success in this domain and hence win the support of its frightened
    people. While on the other hand it deprives the Palestinians of any authority or the
    ability to achieve a so-called &quot;balance of terror&quot;, and instead forces the
    Palestinians to bow down to Israeli demands. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both the PA and the Israeli forces have failed to suppress the
    resistance even with the cooperation of the U.S. as at Sharm Al-Sheikh. The resistance
    will continue and if the PA continues to pressure these groups, it will lead to a fierce
    civil war which can only benefit Israel. Finally, the position of the resistance
    organizations is stronger than before because of the objections of some of the influential
    Arab countries such as Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The growing objections to the peace
    process on both Arab and Islamic levels and Netanyahu's continued obstinacy has so far
    rendered the process a failure and made the resistance movements even more legitimate and
    urgent than before.</p>
