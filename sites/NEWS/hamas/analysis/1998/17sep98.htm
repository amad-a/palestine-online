    <b><h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">The Success (or Not) of the Oslo Agreement</font></b></h3>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot ignore the series of failures that have defined the aftermath
    of the Oslo agreement, signed in 1993. Nevertheless, any logical assessment requires us to
    consider some vital remarks that may be helpful in understanding the future of the
    agreement and the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly on the Palestinian level.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Remark</b></u>: The fruits of the agreement have not
    been the same for both sides. The PA has received only a very limited autonomy. They are
    dependent on Israel while situated on a piece of land that is less than 8% of the West
    Bank and even lesser still than the total area of Palestine. This has scattered
    Palestinian land and likened it to islands in an ocean of Israeli colonies with hegemony
    over the natural resources. Economically, the employment rate is between 40%-50% among the
    Palestinians depending on the Israeli procedures whereas it was around 30% before the
    agreement. The income per capita has also gone down 30%. On the security level, the
    agreement has laid more restrictions and persecution on the Palestinians enforced by the
    PA, who were responsible for the murder of 20 people while in custody of PA soldiers as
    well as 14 more individuals who were shot down by PA policemen during demonstrations on 18
    November 1994. Moreover, the PA has been carrying out arrest campaigns against HAMAS
    activists and disciples as well as other resistance formations just one month after Yasser
    Arafat entered his “kingdom”. The most severe campaign was on 25 February 1996,
    which lasted six months, during which time period more than 2,000 HAMAS activists were
    arrested while protesting the murder of Yahya Ayyash. The PA detention centres are still
    holding more than 200 active members without allowing their cases to be presented in court
    in order to harm the infrastructure of HAMAS and exhaust it in the long run.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, more than 3,000 are still detained in Israeli prisons.
    However, a few were released as part of bargains between the PA and Rabin’s
    ineffectual cabinet, but most of the released were either about to finish their terms of
    imprisonment or had not been political detainees in return for which Israel obtained a lot
    of political yields from the PA. Consequently, the PA failed to realize security for the
    Palestinians, particularly since several individuals, namely Kamal Kaheel, Yahya Ayyash,
    Muhiyedeen Al Sharif, and Emad and Adel Awadallah, have been assassinated by the Israeli
    intelligence systems in the PA region, indicating that the PA has been collaborating with
    these systems.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PA is the product of the corrupt Israeli occupation and its
    neighbouring systems, which in turn has led to a multitude of mal-administration and moral
    and financial corruption within the PA. The most recent examples of its systematic and
    moral corruption include fashion show exhibitions, nightclubs and gambling casinos in
    Jericho, which caused a great shock to the infrastructure of the resistance and left the
    door wide open for such corruption to affect the Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Israeli side, there have been a lot of positive achievements as
    a result of the Oslo agreement, including the attraction of a lot of foreign investment
    during the reign of the Labour Party, the recognition of Israel as a State by a lot of
    Arab and Islamic countries, and the close cooperation with these countries at the
    political and economic levels. Instead of shouldering the financial responsibilities
    toward the Palestinians such as health, education and municipal services, Israel has
    transferred these duties to the PA but kept the security issues in hand throughout
    Palestine. This has been clearly evident over the past five years. In addition, the Jewish
    State has been able to force the PA into keeping the security for the benefit of Israel at
    the expense of the Palestinians, who have been suffering from insecurity because of the
    Israeli procedures carried out by its agents in the PA regions in the same way, but
    sometimes more brutal, than the Israelis. Furthermore, they attempted to diminish the role
    of the resistance at the popular as well as the military level by creating a civil war
    amongst all parties rejecting the agreement by simultaneously undermining these forces,
    especially HAMAS, and considering them as targets in the security issues. Moreover, they
    have dealt with the debate tactically to serve their own interests, and not to prepare the
    Palestinians to repel the Israeli attacks or even to solve their domestic problems.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Second Remark</b></u>: The agreement, which has been aborted
    ever since it was signed, has been used as the terms of reference for all Arab and Western
    States when dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is also considered as the means to
    an end of this crisis and will lead to peaceful co-existence. Therefore, the problem lies
    with the application of the agreement items, not the Israeli occupation and the continuous
    suffering of the Palestinians. On the other hand, the agreement has excluded the
    Palestinian Cause from its Arab and Islamic domain and has limited it to a conflict
    between Palestinians and Israelis. As a result, it considers the conflict a humane issue,
    the resolution of which would reduce the suffering of the Palestinians but not restore
    their homeland; this attitude was welcomed by all defeated Arabs, especially after the
    second Gulf war. The agreement had been pre-arranged at the time when most Arab leaders
    met in Sharm Al-Sheikh in 1996 to sign the treaty against terrorism and wipe out all the
    motives of Jehad (holy war) among Muslims.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Third Remark</b></u>: The agreement was also spoiled by those
    who rejected it in Israel after they had taken over authority by limiting it to the Hebron
    agreement. They have not fulfilled their commitments toward the PA’s ineffectual
    system. This attitude has revealed the shortcomings of the agreement and diminished the
    great expectations of the PA.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The big question is: Has the agreement failed or been disclosed?</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assessment of the agreement should be based on its purposes because
    it was not designed to restore the rights of the Palestinians-although the PA idols
    thought this was the case-but rather its aim was to isolate the Palestinian Cause from its
    Islamic/Arab domain and make it quite a domestic issue based on the security of Israel as
    viewed by Zionism. Consequently, we can consider the agreement as a severe catastrophe and
    disaster for the Palestinians as well as for the Arabs in general because it has failed to
    restore the Palestinian land and rights. On the contrary, it has established the PA as an
    Israeli ally. On the other hand, the agreement has been a great achievement for Israel
    because it ignored the occupation and put both Israel and the PA in one trench while side
    plans to destroy the other and the agreement have created an imbalance in some Palestinian
    attitudes about the conflict, although the attitudes of the extreme Rightists in Israel
    made the Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims recognize this bitter fact given the provocative
    nature of the procedures used by the Israelis. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the future of the agreement does not depend on its success or
    failure as has been propagated by some Palestinians. These misguided individuals have
    adopted the agreement because it has secreted a gang that is using its terms of reference
    for their own interests and to satisfy their lust for authority. This gang must be removed
    and isolated by both Palestinians and Arabs because this group will not learn from the
    long history of our struggle and experiences with Israel. All in all, the agreement has
    failed entirely because it did not lay a well-established base to solve the problem, and
    it has been designed to suit the American-Israeli strategies and their Arab allies in the
    region who support the agreement for the benefit of Israel and not for Palestine.</p>
