    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">The Declaration of the Palestinian State:<br>
    <i>New Bargaining Chip Used by the PA</i></font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the span of five years during which time the Oslo agreement was
    to be realized comes to a close, most of the issues contained therein have not been
    achieved, especially the redeployment. The obstinate Israeli policy regarding this issue
    has forced Yasser Arafat to announce through the mass media that he will soon declare the
    independent Palestinian State on 4 May 1999, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations
    with Netanyahu’s Cabinet. According to the current events and conditions of the PA
    after four years, we can question these threats, which contradict what is going on now
    about the re-deployment and the deteriorating situation of the PA. Yasser Arafat’s
    frantic reaction was precipitated by Netanyahu’s rejection of the American proposal
    of the redeployment from 13% of the West Bank, by the failure of the efforts exerted by
    American envoy Ross to persuade Netanyahu to adopt the proposal, and by the fact that the
    PA has finally discovered that Israel will not compromise its attitude toward imposing
    harsh provisions on the PA in order for it to accept the establishment of a nature reserve
    in 3% of the redeployment area where Palestinians will not be allowed to build houses. All
    of this has been accompanied by the popular rejection and indignation amongst
    Palestinians, who have been frustrated because of the overall failure of the compromise.
    The situation has become worse because of the PA security procedures, the rampant
    corruption and favouritism (which Arafat himself is incapable of stopping because the
    involved persons have connections with Israel and they rival Arafat for his post).
    Consequently, Arafat was pushed to declare the independent State to hide the obvious
    failure of the agreement and to busy Palestinians with minor issues. The most important
    reason for these threats by Arafat was to make Netanyahu adopt the American proposals.
    However, Arafat has gone back to his initial threats since the USA forced him to adopt the
    American-Israeli-Palestinian compromise and to carry out these proposals AFTER Netanyahu
    adopted them with certain amendments. These amendments include establishing a nature
    reserve on 3% of the redeployment area and the rejection of the security protocol of the
    Israeli procedures concerning terrorism, provided the PA prevent the resistance operations
    from their side. The only thing Arafat said in his speech to the United Nations General
    Assembly was that the Palestinians are anticipating their independent State, which should
    be established according to their right to self-determination. His threatening tone became
    milder as the summit conference consisting of the Americans, the Israelis and the
    Palestinians would be held by 15 October 1998. Moreover, he announced during his visit to
    Norway that the Oslo agreement entitled him to declare the independent State just to avoid
    the direct threats and to make this issue based on the agreement, which is considered an
    obvious regression.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the PA departments have promoted this declaration and
    considered it an attempt to fill the legal vacuum at the end of the third episode of the
    transitional period and to prevent extending this period without any restrictions on
    Israel in order to terminate the compromise. However, Ahmed Qurei’ announced that he
    has no objection to postponing the final solution for a few months provided the Israelis
    are more lenient in the current negotiations. This emphasizes the fact that this State
    will not be declared without the approval of Israel and only in accordance with its
    provisions. Furthermore, it confirms the current situation, leaving Palestinian land
    scattered and the PA unable to control these territories, because Israel will be
    controlling the water resources, the borders and the highways that connect these
    territories.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Theoretically, the PA can declare this State, but Israel will entirely
    control the Palestinians, and can abort any political reaction that would be taken by the
    Palestinians against the security, economic or political interests of Israel. The Labour
    Party rejected this State using their &quot;veto&quot; power because it will not be armed
    and powerful so it must be called an &quot;autonomy&quot; not an independent State, which
    would open the channels of normalization with the neighbouring Arab and Islamic countries
    and make Israel more active in the economic, political and security domains in the region
    under the umbrella of the new Middle East order, as well as having an axial role in the
    region. Arafat would have got this concession if the Labour Party had still been ruling,
    regardless of all other considerations; however, this will never be accepted by the Likud
    Party because of its security considerations. Netanyahu emphasized this notion when he was
    being interviewed by Sham’oun Shever, the Israeli journalist from <i>Yed’iot
    Ahrenot</i> on 18 September 1998 when he said, &quot;The Palestinian State can be compared
    to a black box in which everything can enter such as Stinger missile batteries, which will
    make the Israeli air power ineffectual and is considered a strategic threat, not a
    tactical one, because the Palestinians can fire at the Israeli airplanes at Ben Gurion
    Airport. They will also have hideouts, missile launchers and other forces. Besides, they
    can be allied with powerful countries such as Iran and Iraq so the Iraqi and Iranian
    troops will not be far away from Tel Aviv. There is great fear that HAMAS may be able to
    overthrow Arafat and control this Palestinian State so we must preempt any potential ally
    for Iran and Iraq from becoming powerful in Palestine by all means.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an exaggeration because these fears are present at all times
    and they can be avoided through the agreements that make Israel superior in security
    issues. However, these fears become of greatest priority to those who do not adopt peace
    and its benefits for the Hebraic State, and over-emphasize security issues. Despite the
    conflict between the Labour Party and the Likud about the authorities which will be given
    to this State, Netanyahu does not ignore the formalities and he has not been fully
    convinced with the Oslo Agreement and its requirements. Netanyahu’s threats to annex
    the Palestinian land and abolish the Oslo Agreement have become more serious in the light
    of grasping his own attitude toward the agreement and his rejection of any attempt by
    Arafat to declare the Palestinian State in a feeble effort to force Netanyahu to fulfill
    the suspended items of the compromise.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This also includes the security news released by the Israeli army that
    everything is ready to recapture the PA territories in case the State is declared,
    although this notion is greatly doubted because of the essential role of the PA on behalf
    of Israel. Thus, the current conditions have continued to deteriorate since the
    declaration of Palestinian independence ten years ago (15 November 1988) and after it had
    lost the Russian support as well. As a result of the foregoing, the Palestinian
    headquarters has abandoned its most influential methods-the intifadah and the military
    struggle.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, the PA has been prone to all Israeli threats and so any
    declaration of a State will be equivalent to throwing ashes in the eyes and will establish
    a State that is entirely controlled by Israel. Despite the widespread and popular desire
    to obtain real independence, the end result has only amounted to a virtual teasing of the
    people in an effort to conceal an evidently miserable situation. It is remarkable that the
    proposed declaration has not been presented as a well-prepared policy of the PA or a
    comprehensive national plan to capture the land which requires all Palestinians to go back
    to resistance but rather it was just a political tactic to force Israel to fulfill its
    obligations toward the PA.. As a result, the threats disappeared when Israel agreed to do
    so. Moreover, these threats indicate that the PA is still adhering to the worn out
    agreements and insisting on ignoring the real expectations and anticipations of the
    Palestinian people. All of these threats have just been political and informational
    tactics to make the PA continue ruling the Palestinians against their will, interests and
    goals. The entirely independent State is required by all Palestinian nationals, which will
    never be realized through an aborted agreement that has failed in realizing even a few of
    these demands, so how would it enable the Palestinians to restore their homeland and get
    rid of the hegemony of Israel in all aspects of their lives? Finally, these threats will
    not work out unless the PA is capable of shouldering the consequences of this declaration
    and snatch it from Israel by force and through resistance. However, this will not be done
    by the PA given its virtual submission to all of the security demands of Israel instead of
    adhering and sticking to its popular and national background to confront the Israeli plans
    and stop them as well.</p>
