    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Palestinian national conferences were held in Gaza, Ramallah and
    Damascus in reply to the 14 December conference held by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza
    during which the participants revoked the Palestinian National Charter in the presence of
    President Clinton of the United States.<br>
    Although previous sessions of the Palestinian National Council had overstepped the
    Palestinian National Charter and although the Charter was practically revoked in a special
    session of the PNC in 1996, the implications of the PA’s recent conference in Gaza,
    the main purpose of which was to reiterate the nullification of the Charter in response to
    a specific Israeli request, put the opposition Palestinian forces in a position to bear
    the sole responsibility of discrediting the legitimacy of the PA’s meeting in Gaza.
    The opposition were also required to reaffirm the principles of the Palestinian People and
    their national rights and to expose the consequences of the PA’s meeting in Gaza.<br>
    The Wye River memorandum, which was widely opposed by the Palestinian Street, enhanced
    this motive because of the submission by the PA to the unjust Israeli security conditions
    that could destroy the foundation of the unity of the Palestinian People and lead to the
    crackdown on the forces that resist the occupation. These extreme security conditions were
    imposed by the Israelis in return for a small percentage of redeployment of the occupation
    troops in the West Bank.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">The unity of the Palestinian People in both
    the Occupied Territories and the Diaspora in terms of adherence to their national rights</font></p>
    </b></u><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meetings were held as part of an initiative by the
    Palestinian organizations that reject the Oslo and Wye River agreements. Many Palestinian
    national independent figures took part in the meetings. Despite the different views of the
    participants inside and outside Occupied Palestine, there were basic common denominators
    such as the rejection of the Wye River agreement, the stressing of the unity of the
    Palestinian People, the maintenance of their national identity, the rejection of the
    nullification of the Palestinian National Charter, and the adherence to the right of the
    Palestinian People to resistance until the removal of the occupation.<br>
    The meetings came at the same time of the Gaza meeting in order to indicate that those who
    met in Gaza in the presence of the U.S. President did not represent the Palestinian
    People, nor did they have the right to revoke the Palestinian National Charter or any of
    the basic rights of the Palestinian People.<br>
    The two opposition meetings in Gaza and Ramallah were attended by representatives of
    Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP, DFLP, the Arab Liberation Front and the Palestinian
    People’s Party, as well as many of the independent figures, in particular Abdullah
    Horani, a former member of the PLO’s Executive Committee who was stripped of his
    membership in the PLO Central Council because he opposed the nullification of the Charter
    and therefore was not able to attend the PA’s meeting in Gaza. A number of members of
    the PA’s Legislative Council, the National Council and the PLO’s Central Council
    were also among the attendees. <br>
    It was noted that 104 members of the Palestinian National Council had signed a three-point
    appeal during the Ramallah meeting. The appeal stressed the participants’ agreement
    on the rejection of the Wye River memorandum because of its unjust political and security
    commitments, the rejection of the U.S. and Israeli dictates regarding the amendment of the
    PLO Charter, and the protection of the PLO by reconstructing its institutions on a
    democratic and a consolidatory basis. More than 1,000 people attended the two meetings:
    350 in the Gaza meeting and 700 in the West Bank.<br>
    As for the Damascus meeting, about 500 persons attended representing the eight Alliance
    organizations as well as the PFLP and the DFLP, who withdrew from the Alliance in 1997. It
    was also attended by many independent figures, namely Khaled Al Fahoum, Dr. Anees Sayegh,
    Shafiq Al Hout, Salah Al Dabbagh, Bassam Al Shakaa and Abdel Rahman Al Hourani. A number
    of Arab figures were among those mentioned as guests of honour such as Ahmad Ben Bella, a
    former President of Algeria; Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary-General of the Lebanese
    Hizbullah Party; Faisal Moulawi, Secretary-General of Jamaa Islamiyya in Lebanon; Ahmad
    Dan of the Algerian Peace Society; Mustafa Rumaid, a member of the Moroccan parliament;
    and Yasin Omar Imam, the assistant Secretary-General of the Arab-Islamic People’s
    Conference in Sudan. Arab, Islamic and European diplomats were also among the guests.<br>
    The Jordanian authorities, perhaps in response to some foreign demands or to requirements
    of certain agreements, prevented more than 60 members of the Palestinian National
    Conference from departing Jordan to take part in the conference. They also prevented Mr.
    Khaled Misha’al, chairman of the Hamas political bureau, along with members of the
    bureau and representatives of some Jordanian parties from crossing the borders to attend
    the Damascus meeting. Despite the strangeness of this intervention by the Jordanian
    Government, the meeting went on and achieved its purposes.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">Achievements of the conferences</font></b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important achievement of these conferences was the formation
    of national follow-up committees to implement the decisions agreed upon during the
    conferences and to discuss national work formulas and mechanisms for the future. The
    committees will coordinate among themselves to reach a joint national programme that
    unites the Palestinian forces in the Occupied Territories and the Diaspora, taking into
    consideration certain circumstances experienced by the Palestinian People under PA
    control.<br>
    It was noted that there were differences between decisions made by the two opposition
    meetings in Gaza and Ramallah and those made by the Damascus conference. While the first
    two meetings avoided any condemnation of the Palestinian Authority or any statement that
    the PA’s meeting in Gaza was illegal, the meeting in Damascus did not hesitate to do
    so. The statements issued by the Ramallah and Gaza meetings also did not include any
    implication as to the “restoration of the Palestinian Question from the hands of the
    Oslo architects and the prevention of the Palestinian negotiators from giving dangerous
    relinquishments to the Zionists” as the Damascus meeting stated. This is referred to
    for two reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The keenness of participants in the Ramallah and Gaza meetings not
        to clash with the PA by implying that the Palestinian opposition front seeks to create an
        alternative leadership to the PLO. <br>
        2. Some participants in the Ramallah and Gaza meetings opposed the Wye River portion of
        the agreements raised by the participants, namely the People’s Party and some
        Palestinian figures. This forced the remaining participants to lower the ceiling of their
        demands in order to find a common political ground. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important meaning of these meetings, regardless of some
    differences that were caused by the political pressures of the geography and by some
    different attitudes of participants regarding the peace settlement, was that it expressed
    a Palestinian national consensus over the commitments to the objectives of the Palestinian
    People that were included in the National Convention. There was also a national consensus
    over the rejection of the political and security consequences of the political agreements,
    especially the Wye River agreement.<br>
    As for the Damascus meeting, which was considered the central and the most important
    conference of the Palestinian Opposition Front, it clearly voiced the intention of the
    Palestinian People to achieve their national goals, at the top of which is the removal of
    the occupation, even if in so doing would lead to the isolation of the leadership which
    moved out of these goals. There are other national goals the Palestinian People are
    determined to achieve, such as the re-organization of the Palestinian internal house, and
    the creation of a new authority for them, after the so-called peace agreements made the
    PLO a mere instrument to serve the “peace settlement” programme.<br>
    Consequently, these conferences have served as significant information messages to the
    world, indicating that what happened in the PA’s Gaza meeting did not represent the
    Palestinian People and that there are many active ranks among them that reject the
    nullification of the National Charter who are committed to the unity of Palestinian land
    from the River to the Sea, who vow to remove the occupation, and who insist upon adopting
    the armed struggle as the sole strategy to liberate Palestine.<br>
    This is why the extensive representation of all categories of the Palestinian People in
    these conferences was very important. They were not confined to representatives of the
    opposition factions, which emphasize the unity of the Palestinian People and their
    abidance by their legitimate national goals.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">Alternative programme to “Oslo”</font></b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian national conferences resulted in important decisions as
    outlined below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They asserted the rejection of the Wye River agreement and its consequences. </li>
      <li>They decided that those responsible for the decisions made concerning the amendment of
        the Palestinian National Charter making it null and illegal lack national legitimacy. </li>
      <li>They stressed the right of the Palestinian People to continue their resistance in order
        to extract their legitimate rights. </li>
      <li>They appreciated the reaction of the Arab and Muslim people throughout the world to this
        right. </li>
      <li>They stressed the strong relation between the Palestinian People and their Arab and
        Islamic Nation.</li>
      <li>They enhanced the deep relation of the Palestinian People to their homeland and stressed
        their rejection of attempts to dissolve the Palestinian national identity. </li>
    </ol>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the most important practical decision was the formation of
    national follow-up committees to implement the decisions and recommendations of the
    conferences and the agreement on the future Palestinian national working plan with the aim
    of achieving the objectives of the Palestinian People to return home and to get their full
    national independence.<br>
    In order to make these conferences representative of significant historical turning points
    regarding the Palestinian Question, they should prepare national working plans to achieve
    two main goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The preservation of the Palestinian national identity inside and outside the Occupied
        Territories through the creation of suitable frameworks and the adherence to the
        Palestinian rights. </li>
      <li>The continuation of resistance and armed struggle against the occupation. </li>
    </ol>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are differences among the participating factions and figures
    over the framework and plans because of geographical differences and different political
    positions, they should not impede reaching a national programme that includes, at least in
    the present time, (tactical) gradual political frameworks, which can be developed in
    future into organizational structures that are able to gather the forces and categories of
    the Palestinian People.<br>
    It is important to point out the experience of the 10 Palestinian opposition factions that
    were reduced to eight, and which had their political action retreated instead of being
    developed. This is because some Palestinian factions were hesitant and did not take
    decisive attitudes towards the Oslo accords and their consequences. This should be avoided
    at all costs so as not to impede the development of the Palestinian national conferences.
    The active Palestinian powers, on the top of which is Hamas, should take great
    responsibility in reaching a national framework and programme that depends directly on the
    Palestinian People and the other active national factions and figures.</p>
