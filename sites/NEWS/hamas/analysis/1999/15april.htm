    <b><h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">Arafat’s tour between the Berlin
    Declaration<br>
    and the postponement of statehood declaration</font></h3>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arguments concerning the declaration of the Palestinian independent
    State have increased with the slated date of 4 May fast approaching. The most significant
    and important development during the past month was the declaration by the European
    nations supporting the establishment of a Palestinian independent State, which coincided
    with a tour by Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, of several European
    and Asian countries as well as his meeting with U.S. President Clinton during the latter
    part of March.</p>
    <i><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">No change in the American position…<br>
    PA collects justifications to postpone statehood declaration</font></p>
    </b></i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arafat’s European and Asian tour was disappointing because
    he was pressured into postponing the declaration of the Palestinian independent state in
    order not to give Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu a chance to use it in his electoral
    campaign against his rivals in the Labour Party, which could lead him and his
    Party—the Likud—to winning next month’s elections.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it seems that Arafat did not expect such an answer from his hosts.
    Moreover, it is likely he was seeking justifications for his next step regarding the
    postponement of the declaration of this State. He also sought gains from Europe and the
    United States in exchange for introducing this relinquishment regarding the statehood
    declaration.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now Arafat, who kept claiming the 4 May date as sacred to the
    declaration of the state, wants to find a suitable justification to adjourn this
    declaration by showing that there is an international desire to support the
    Palestinians’ right of an independent state and that he may adjourn its declaration
    to an unspecified date provided he gets a pledge from the U.S. and Europe to press the
    Israelis to extend between six months and one year the transitional period in order to
    avoid a legal vacuum after 4 May, which would give the Israelis a chance to free
    themselves from their commitments to the peace accords with the PLO after that date; it
    may also weaken the legal and political status of the Palestinian Authority. Arafat heard
    during his tour identical calls from his hosts to adjourn the statehood declaration. He
    heard these calls even from the Arab states he visited, in particular Egypt, when
    President Mubarak clearly demanded Arafat to adjourn this declaration for six months.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most disappointing station on his tour was the United States.
    Several days before Arafat’s visit to Washington, the U.S. Congress had voted on a
    decision objecting to a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian independent State on 4
    May, indicating that this would “destroy the peace process completely.” The
    Congress, with a majority of 380 votes against 34 votes, threatened to cut U.S. assistance
    to the PA if the latter decided to declare the state unilaterally!</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the U.S. Administration had not adopted that decision, the
    outcome of the Arafat-Clinton meeting disappointed the PA, in particular the U.S.
    Administration’s refusal to recognize the right of the Palestinian People to
    self-determination and to establish their independent state. It opines that “the
    Palestinians have their ambitions and the Israelis have their own viewpoint, which means
    that a decision made by the U.S. Administration in this regard would not be useful.”</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. Administration tried to cover up its position by expressing
    “anxiety” over the continued Israeli policy of expanding settlements. However,
    it did not condemn or even oppose this policy at the same level of its opposition to the
    declaration of the Palestinian State.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Saeb Ureikat, the PA’s chief negotiator, linked the position
    of the Israeli Right and the U.S. Administration pertaining to the rejection of the
    Palestinians’ right to self-determination and its independent state. This reflects
    the PA’s disappointment because it could not exchange the adjournment of the
    declaration of the independent state for any gains from the U.S.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The American position, expressed by U.S. Advisor for National Security
    Samuel Berger before Arafat’s visit to Washington, states that “any new American
    initiative is postponed until after the Israeli elections.” This position takes into
    consideration the keenness of the U.S. Administration on not provoking the American Jewish
    Lobby, which supports the Israeli Right. Therefore, the U.S. Administration does not want
    to give any indication that it sympathizes with the self-determination for Palestinians.
    It also wants to support the Labour Party in the coming Israeli elections by pressuring
    the PA into preventing it from declaring their state on 4 May.</p>
    <i><b><p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Relative improvement in the European
    position… But…</font></b></i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The European attitude was more moderate than the American one regarding
    the declaration of the state. On 1 March, the European Union, in response to warnings by
    Netanyahu’s government to European officials of the consequences of visiting
    Palestinian institutions in occupied East Jerusalem, refused to recognize Israel’s
    sovereignty over the Holy City, including the 1948-occupied West Jerusalem. The European
    Union also adopted United Nations resolution 181 of 1949, which considers Jerusalem an
    international city, and indicated that it does not owe allegiance to any side but to the
    United Nations. This caused Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to declare before the
    foreign ambassadors in Israel that this resolution is null and void and that Jerusalem
    will remain a unified capital of the Jewish people and Israel.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European position was pushed forward after the end of Arafat’s
    tour of Europe, which was made clear in the Berlin Declaration that was announced
    following the European summit in Berlin on 26 March. The Declaration supports the
    Palestinian Authority and encourages Chairman Arafat to postpone the statehood
    declaration. But the European governments stressed the right of the Palestinian People to
    declare their state and expressed their readiness to recognize it. The Declaration states:
    “<i><b>The European Union reaffirms the Palestinians’ permanent and
    unconditional right of self-determination including the State option. The EU is looking
    forward to having a negotiable solution based on the current agreements without any
    prejudice of this right that should not be subject to any veto.”</p>
    </b></i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This recent position is more advanced than the one adopted by
    the EU during last year’s Cardiff summit, which called on the Jewish State to
    recognize the self-determination of the Palestinian People. This reflected how the
    European countries were disappointed with Netanyahu’s policies and the continuation
    of the Israeli rejection of the right of the Palestinian People to self-determination. It
    also shows that Europe has the desire to play a more active role in the
    Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, even if this can only be achieved through the
    implementation of the agreements that were sponsored and backed by the United States. For
    although Europe is slowly consolidating its unity through economy, its politically
    un-united status does not qualify it to lead a new initiative competing with the American
    one to resolve the most sophisticated struggle in the world.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent European stand cannot also be separated from the efforts
    being exerted to encourage Arafat to postpone the statehood declaration. The European
    Union wanted to send a clear message to the Palestinian side that it supports its right of
    an independent state as a reward for responding to its demand to adjourn the statehood
    declaration.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the statement by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin
    Indyk, in which he rejected the Berlin Declaration, the U.S. Administration did not assail
    or criticize it. Moreover, it might find it another tool to press Netanyahu to resume
    talks with the Palestinians without the Administration bearing the direct burden of
    supporting the independent state.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new European stand enhances the opinion that Europe is trying to
    develop its role in the region through coordination and consultation with the United
    States, because it is presently not able to compete with the American role, which
    dominates NATO. The United States also enhances its political and military role in Europe
    by the direct intervention in solving the regional and ethnic conflicts there such as what
    is happening in Kosovo and what happened in Bosnia and Northern Ireland.</p>
    <i><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">A political activity which lacks power!</font></b></i></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most significant fact about Arafat’s recent tour is that his
    political activity was a failure in advance and useless because it was not based on an
    established power on the ground. Despite Arafat’s frequent tours of the four corners
    of the globe, the reality of Israeli domination over Palestinian land remained as it is.
    It has even increased recently considering the remarkable increase in Jewish settlement
    activities and in the harsh Israeli measures against the PA’s institutions in
    Occupied Jerusalem.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the European position can be seen relatively as a positive
    development compared with the American position, the possibility of translating the
    European position into practical results hardly exists unless it is accepted by the
    Israelis and hence by the Americans. This position is a kind of expanded autonomy, even if
    it takes the title of a “State” accepted by the Labour Party or an
    “entity” as the Likud insists on.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Palestinian Authority, which seeks a deformed “State”
    subject to Occupation, cannot protect the right of the Palestinian People to
    self-determination as long as it accepts to be a puppet in the hands of the Occupation.
    The right of self-determination should be supported by force and resistance, which is
    being fiercely combated by the PA. The independent state should own real supremacy, which
    is now being monopolized by the Occupation authorities.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the balance of power is not in favour of the Palestinian
    Authority, and because it accepted to enter the negotiations with the Occupation still in
    force, the results of the negotiations were destructive to the Palestinian People and the
    Cause. It does not seem that this PA has learned any lessons from its experiences or from
    the negative developments of the Oslo accords. The PA, on the contrary, insists to give
    more relinquishments, which eventually will lead to the establishment of an Israeli
    foothold on Palestinian land and to the confiscation of more rights of the Palestinian
    People—this time with an official Palestinian approval and blessing!</p>
