mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The Wye-2 agreement signed at Sharm el-Sheikh of Egypt
      on 5 September 1999 between the Israeli government and the PLO was
      considered to be the practical approach to found a base to the final
      resolution of the Palestinian Question. This was proven through linking
      the third and last phase of the agreement with the agreement of principles
      on the final solution, which is supposed to be reached in February 2000.
      The Zionist Prime Minister Ehud Barak succeeded in implementing some of
      the provisions of the Wye River Memorandum signed by his predecessor
      Netanyahu as his approach to play the role of a man of peace before the
      region and the World. He also wanted to show that Israel was serious in
      implementing the agreements. However, he achieved the philosophy of his
      spiritual father—Rabin—that is dates are not sacred in agreements.
      Barak used this as a way to make Israel politically and economically open
      to the Arab and Muslim worlds, and in pressuring Jordan and the
      Palestinian Authority to escalate their measures against Hamas in order to
      weaken it.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">A deliberate study of the contents of the Wye River
      agreements, both the original and the amended one at Sharm el-Sheikh,
      proves that they lead to the physical separation between the Palestinian
      People and the Jewish settlers in the West Bank. But they do not achieve
      any real political or geographical independence for the Palestinians. For
      the redeployment will eventually conclude with only 5.4% of the total area
      of the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority’s total control and
      29.3% under the PA’s civil control. However, about 94.6% of the West
      Bank will remain under the so-called Israeli security control. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">On the other hand, the Palestinian control will be on
      separated and isolated pockets of the West Bank surrounded by Jewish
      settlements and their bypass roads, which gives the upper hand to the
      Israeli Occupation authorities. Meanwhile, Israel will officially annex
      the Jewish settlements and concentrations, which amount to more than 60%
      of the West Bank. These settlements are well connected, covering the West
      Bank from north to south and from west to east; and suffocating the
      Palestinian populated areas. The Palestinians’ movement and mobility
      will be hindered by this situation. The Palestinians will also face
      difficulties in using the supplies of the underground water.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The Wye River agreement makes the so-called “safe
      passage” between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under total Israeli
      control. The external communication of the West Bank and Gaza with the
      external world and their borders and ports all will remain under Israeli
      security. Moreover, the Occupation troops will not withdraw from any part
      of Occupied Jerusalem.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The final status talks are based, according to Israeli
      understanding of the Wye River memo, on these facts: Palestinian separated
      cantons, and complete Israeli control over the communication between the
      West Bank and Gaza as well as over the communication of each with the
      external world. Therefore, Barak can consider the declaration of the
      Palestinian State under these conditions and circumstances. He can also
      “invent” a new Jerusalem in any neighbouring Palestinian village to be
      made as a capital of the Palestinian State in accordance with Beilen-Abu
      Mazen agreement. Therefore, we can say that Barak succeeded, during his
      first three months in office, to establish and enhance the Israeli vision
      of the final resolution of the Palestinian Question, a thing that
      Netanyahu failed to achieve in three years.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">On the other hand, the red lines set by Barak
      concerning the final solution which deny the right of return to
      Palestinian refugees and displaced persons, and which reject the complete
      military withdrawal from the Occupied Territories in accordance with
      United Nations resolution 242. These red lines also deny the Arab and
      Muslim right to Jerusalem, to Palestinians’ water sources, and to their
      right to have an independent State with real sovereignty, as well as to
      their right to live on their land like other people in the world. Barak
      wants to make sure the Palestinian People remain paralyzed and weak in the
      security, military and economic fields. He also wants them to decrease
      their population, to have poor natural resources, and to remain isolated
      from the external world except through the Israeli gate. This leads to the
      liquidation not the resolution of the Palestinian Cause. Therefore, Israel
      denies the human and political rights of the Palestinian People and it
      does not recognize or realize them.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Any Palestinian involvement in the final status talks
      based on the Wye River agreement and on Barak’s set of “Nos” will be
      considered a complete submission and abandonment of our rights in favour
      of Israel while the Zionist regime works to liquidate and weaken the
      Palestinian opposition and resistance led by Hamas. Dependence on the
      muscles of the Palestinian negotiator and his eloquence and on the
      “good” intentions of the Israeli Labour government is the first step
      towards defeat and surrender in these talks. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The experience with the Zionist movement and Israel
      over the last few decades proved that the physical and economic attrition
      of the Zionist regime and the resistance of the occupation are the most
      effective way to force Israel to give “relinquishments”. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      Today, Hamas is leading this resistance, which makes the crackdown on
      Hamas a service in favour of the Zionist plan and which weakens the
      Palestinian position in the final status negotiations.<o:p>
