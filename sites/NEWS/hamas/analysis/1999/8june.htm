    </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">A careful reading into the outcome of the elections of the 15<sup>th</sup>
    session of the Israeli Knesset indicates important changes. It also shows that the reasons
    for these changes focus on ethnic, economic and personal factors and that the political
    factor did not play a big role this time because of the similarity of the platforms of the
    main Zionist parties, especially their respective position regarding the current peace
    process.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Contrary to the wishful thinking of the supporters of the peace process,
    the new map as drawn by the Knesset and the coming Israeli government will not have a
    strong positive effect on the process.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="left">Review of the results</b></u><br>
    Following are the details comparing the trends and results of the Israeli parties, which
    succeeded in occupying seats in the Knesset, to the elections of the 1996 14<sup>th</sup>
    session of the Knesset.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">1. The Left parties</b><br>
    A. The &#147;One Israel&#148; list, led by Ehud Barak (a coalition of parties of Labour;
    Gesher, led by David Levy who split from the Likud; and Meimad, a small religious movement
    that supports a peace settlement with the Palestinians and calls for an understanding
    between the non-secularists and the secularists), gained 34 seats in the 1996 elections.
    It gained 26 seats in the recent elections, a loss of 8 seats.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. Meretz Party, led by Yossi Sarid, occupied 10 seats in the 1999
    elections compared to 9 seats gained in 1996, a gain of 1 seat.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">C. One People Party, led by Amir Peretz, gained 2 seats in the 1999
    elections. Peretz is a former leader of the Labour Party and head of the Histadrut. The
    Party was established recently to defend the workers and the retirees. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Accordingly, the leftist parties have gained 38 seats in the 1999
    elections of the Knesset, losing 5 seats from the 1996 Knesset.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">2. The Centrist parties</b><br>
    A. The Centre Party, led by Yitzhak Mordechai, did not participate in the 1996 elections
    and occupied 6 seats in the recent elections. The Party was established by the former
    leaders of the Likud and the Labour.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. Yisrael B'aliya (new immigrant), led by Natan Sharansky, gained 7 seats
    in the 1996 elections and 6 in the recent May elections. It is the party of the Russian
    Jews and voted this time for Barak while they voted for Netanyahu in 1996.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">C. Shinui (change) Party is a newly formed party led by Tomi Lapid. The
    party participated in the 1999 elections after splitting from the Meretz Party and gained
    6 seats. Shinui is a secular party and politically extreme.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">D. The Third Way Party, led by Avigdor Kahalani, occupied four seats in
    the 1996 elections, yet failed to gain any seats in the recent May elections.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, the Centrist parties occupied a total of 18 seats in the 1999
    Knesset, marking an increase of 7 seats from the 1996 elections.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">3. The Rightist parties</b><br>
    A. The Likud, led by Benyamin Netanyahu (resigned), gained only 19 seats in the last
    elections although it occupied 32 seats in the 1996 elections.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. Yisrael Beiteinu Party, led by Avigodor Liberman, participated in the
    1999 elections for the first time and gained four seats. Established by Liberman, a former
    advisor of Netanyahu, the party is another one for the Russian Jews. Its supporters voted
    for Netanyahu in the Prime Minister elections.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">4. The Extreme rightist parties</b><br>
    A. The National Union Alliance, formerly led by Benny Begin, gained three seats in the
    last elections compared to two seats in 1996. It is a coalition of three parties: the new
    Herot, led by Benny Begin who split from the Likud; Tokoma, a new settlement party that
    supports the idea of Greater Israel and established by former figures of the religious
    Mifdal party; and the Moledet, led by Rahba&#146;am Zevy who supports the
    &#147;optional&#148; expelling of the Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. The National Religious Party (Mifdal), led by Yitzhak Levy, gained five
    seats in the last elections compared to nine seats in 1996. It is classified as a
    religious party for the Jews of Western origin.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The total number of seats of the rightist and extreme rightist parties in
    the new Knesset is 32 seats, a loss of 8 seats from the previous Knesset.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">5. The Religious parties</b><br>
    A. Shas, led by Arie Deire, gained 17 seats in the last elections compared to only 10
    seats in 1996. It is the party of the oriental Jews (Sephardim).</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. The United Torah Judaism is an ultra-Orthodox party for the Western
    Jews led by Meir Bouruch. It gained five seats in the last elections compared to four
    seats in 1996.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Accordingly, the total number of seats gained by the religious parties in
    the 1999 Knesset is 22 seats compared to 14 seats in the 1996 Knesset.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT">6. The Arab parties</b><br>
    A. The Arab United List (Ra&#146;am), led by Abdel Malek Dahamsheh, gained five seats in
    the May elections compared to four seats in 1996. It is a coalition of a wing of the
    Islamic Movement, the Arab Democratic Party and the Communist Party.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">B. The Democratic Front for Equality (Hadash), led by Mohammad Baraka,
    gained three seats in the new elections compared to five seats in 1996.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">As for the election of the Prime Minister, Ehud Barak gained 56.1% of the
    votes against 43.9% gained by Netanyahu. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">We can conclude the following:</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Netanyahu was heavily defeated and the Likud was the biggest loser for
    it lost 13 seats it was occupying previously in the 1996 Knesset.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">2. The Labour Party was the No. 2 loser since it lost eight seats. Taking
    into consideration that the &#147;One Israel&#148; list included Gesher and Meimad, which
    won a total of three seats, Labour actually lost 11 seats.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">3. The No.3 loser was the National Religious Party (Mifdal), which lost
    four seats because some prominent figures in the Party had split to form the Tokoma party,
    which joined the National Union Alliance under Benny Begin.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">4. The biggest winner was Shas of the Sephardim Jews, which gained an
    additional seven seats, making it the third biggest party after the Labour and the Likud.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">5. The failure of a number of racist extremist leaders such as Rafael
    Eitan (Tsomet party) and of political extremism such as Avigdor Kahalani (Third Way Party)
    because of their inability to gain the minimum 1.5% of votes.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">6. A number of newly established parties recorded a relatively reasonable
    success in the May elections such as Shinui and the Centre.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">7. The racial and sectarian factors and their interests played a
    significant role in the formation of the electoral coalitions and lists such as the
    Russian Jews, the Sephardim Jews and the Arabs. These factors attracted the attention of
    the Israeli electors.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">8. In continuing the old phenomena, the military figures enjoyed more
    popularity than the political leaders.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">9. The Arab lists maintained their number of seats in the Knesset which
    were gained in the 1996 elections. They also succeeded in gaining one more seat. Now there
    are 13 Arab members occupying seats in the Knesset (9 from the three Arab lists, two from
    the Labour, and one each from the Likud and Meretz).</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="LEFT">Why Did Netanyahu Lose?</b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was clear that there was an overwhelming desire among the Israeli
    parties and the Zionist public alike to get rid of Netanyahu. This is attributed to some
    personal characteristics of Netanyahu such as his selfishness, his arrogance, his
    tyrannical behaviour, his lying, his deceiving, his swindling, and the marginalization of
    the people. These characteristics were a direct reason why his partners in the ruling
    party left him such as Mordechai, Meridor, Milu and Begin. This is also what made a man
    such as Shamir, the former Likud leader and Prime Minister, not vote for him and not even
    for the Likud. Shamir accused Netanyahu of destroying the Likud.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Netanyahu&#146;s term recorded a marked reverse in the economic growth and
    an increase in the rate of unemployment, which in turn developed racial and opportunistic
    links and lists. Barak and the Labour Party were clever when they succeeded to neutralize
    the security element (which Netanyahu had claimed for himself) by stressing on
    Barak&#146;s military record. As Barak was on equal footing with Netanyahu regarding the
    security issue, the Israeli voters preferred Barak for his attitudes regarding the social
    and economic issues.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Although the U.S. Administration declared it would not interfere in the
    Israeli elections, it also had the desire to remove Netanyahu. Therefore, it supported
    Mordechai and encouraged him to form the Centre Party. Later, it encouraged him to
    tactically withdraw from the elections to leave Netanyahu and Barak alone in the race.
    Barak had also brought three American experts to help him in his election campaign.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, the frustration with Netanyahu&#146;s policies and the
    encouragement by the Palestinian Authority, convinced 94% of the Arabs of 1948-Occupied
    Palestine to vote for Barak.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The exact description of Netanyahu&#146;s defeat is that it aimed at
    stripping Netanyahu of power more than being a support for Barak. What happened was a
    personal defeat for Netanyahu.</p>
    <b><u><p ALIGN="LEFT">Indications of the elections</p>
    <ol START="0">
      <li></u></b>A semi-consensus existed among the top three Israeli parties (Labour, Likud and
        Shas) regarding the rights of the Palestinian People, especially regarding the issues of
        Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and the importance of security and
        peace as a base for the peace process, and not the principle of &#147;Land for
        Peace&#148;. They also have similar attitudes concerning the rejection of the Palestinian
        independent State, and the return to the borders of 4 June 1967.<b><u></li>
      </u></b>
      <li>The peace settlement and negotiations with the Palestinian Authority were not basic
        items on the platforms of the major Israeli parties, especially Barak&#146;s party, which
        focused on the economic issues and the split and fragmentation within the Zionist Society.
        Therefore, Barak&#146;s victory should not be seen as a change in the Zionist trends
        towards giving the Palestinian People their legitimate rights.</li>
      <li>The change in the number of seats held by the Zionist parties in the Knesset does not
        reflect a social, ideological or political change in the Zionist Society. But rather it
        refers to a change of positions among these parties for local reasons concerning the
        interests of these parties or their leaders.</li>
      <li>The economic regression was a direct reason for forming the electoral lists and
        coalitions on racial or opportunistic grounds.</li>
      <li>The unification of the Zionist stand and the prevention of more splits and fragmentation
        have become well-known Zionist demands. This was reflected in Barak&#146;s slogans and his
        initial plans to broaden the government coalition.</li>
      <li>The tension and coolness that affected Israel&#146;s relations with the United States
        and Europe during Netanyahu&#146;s term pushed the Zionist Street to vote for Barak and
        against Netanyahu in order to improve Israel&#146;s image in the world, especially in the
        United States.</li>
    </ol>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="LEFT">The future of the Peace Process in light of the new change</b></u></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The combination of members of the new Knesset gives Barak various options
    to form his government. But it does not seem that Barak prefers a narrow leftist
    coalition. The current negotiations to form a new Israeli government indicate that the
    likely formation is a national unity government or a centrist leftist government allying
    with some religious parties.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyhow, and regardless of the formation of the new Israeli government, the
    positions of this government towards the peace process will be governed by the
    Labour&#146;s vision and by the balance between the religious and rightist parties. This
    will make these positions similar, in general, to those of Netanyahu&#146;s government,
    especially regarding the final status issues, differing only in the tactics used.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">It is obvious that Barak will restore the negotiations to their track, but
    he will not implement the agreements with the Palestinians easily. For he stated, after
    winning, that he would study these agreements before giving his opinion. It is likely that
    Barak will give priority to negotiations on the withdrawal from South Lebanon and to reach
    an agreement with Syria concerning the Golan Heights.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak&#146;s military history and his positions are more hard-line than
    those of his predecessors Rabin and Perez. This was evidenced in his famous &#147;four
    Nos&#148;: No to negotiating the future of Jerusalem as a unified and eternal capital of
    Israel; no to the return to the 1967 borders; no to dismantling the Jewish settlements in
    the West Bank and Gaza; and no to the existence of a &#147;foreign&#148; army West of the
    Jordan River. This will make the positions of the new government in the final status talks
    very similar to those of Netanyahu&#146;s positions with the exception of some tactical
    differences.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The new government may show a relative response in the peace process but
    this may happen after some time. It is also expected to last for a short period because of
    disputes that will more than likely arise over the implementation of the agreements. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the negative outcomes of this change may be the return of the Arab
    parties to rely on the Israeli party to achieve a reasonable political settlement. This
    could also be followed by the resumption of normalization of ties with the Jewish State
    under the pretext of encouraging its government to go ahead in the implementation of the
    agreements.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the Arab reaction toward the new change in the Jewish State was
    not at the same level of the positive reactions toward the outcome of the Israeli
    elections in 1992. This is attributed to the fact that the Rabin-Perez government was not
    encouraging concerning the progress of the peace process. But time will prove the
    tendencies of the new Israeli government cannot be relied upon by the Arab parties.</p>
