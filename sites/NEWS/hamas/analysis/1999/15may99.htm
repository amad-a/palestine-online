    <b><h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000">4 May—Oslo’s Epitome of Failure</font></b></h3>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth of May passed by without heralding any real achievements for
    the Palestinians. Neither the Palestinian State was declared by the Palestinian Authority
    nor the Palestinians’ hope to see the removal of occupation realized. In fact, the
    Zionist Occupation troops only withdrew from a tiny area of the Palestinian territories.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five years after the signing of the Oslo accords, the outcome appears
    to be an incomplete self-rule. The final status talks have not started as yet because the
    PA could not oblige the Israeli side to implement the provisions of the Oslo accords
    according to their scheduled dates. The timetable of redeployment of the occupation troops
    was subject to change and deletion according to the Israeli minds.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Oslo agreement was an attempt to settle the Palestinian Cause
    through the dismantling of the struggle elements and through separating them on the basis
    of theme and time. The Oslo process also postponed the strategic and sensitive issues to
    the final status negotiations. It gives the Palestinians self-rule on a limited percentage
    of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 against a security role by the Palestinian
    Authority, which serves the interests of the Occupation, and against the relinquishment of
    what remained from the Palestinian land as well as the establishment of peace and mutual
    recognition between the Palestinians and the Israelis.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the ambiguity of the provisions of the Oslo accords and the
    detailed agreements that followed made the Israeli side impose its own perspectives
    regarding the implementation of these provisions. Even the clear provisions were changed
    by the Israelis to serve their interests such as what happened when the redeployment of
    the Israeli occupation troops in the West Bank was not implemented in Hebron, which was
    divided into two parts: (H1) and (H2).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although all the Israeli troops were completely redeployed from all the
    Palestinian towns in the West Bank, 20% of Hebron remained under the direct Occupation
    security control.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On several occasions, the timetables of redeployment were altered in
    the towns and in the villages and other rural areas. In the end, Netanyahu invented a new
    zone different than the A, B and C areas, which are stated in the Oslo accords, calling it
    natural protectorate in order not to be given back to the PA.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the safeguarded passages between Gaza and the West Bank
    have not been opened as yet. The Israeli authorities released only a few of the numerous
    Palestinian prisoners and detainees under different security pretexts. And the Palestinian
    territories remain subject to closure whenever the Israelis feel like it, giving little
    regard to the Palestinians protests.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most significant aspect of the Oslo accords was the so-called
    security coordination between the occupation authorities and the Palestinian Authority,
    which was detailed in the 1994 Cairo agreement. It was also one of the main provisions in
    all of the detailed agreements between the two sides. The Wye River agreement added a new
    dimension to the security cooperation by involving the CIA in monitoring the PA’s
    implementation of the security provisions in the agreement. This created new burdens and
    pressures on the Palestinian Authority along with the pressures already exerted by the
    Israeli government to oblige the PA to abide by Israel’s security instructions to run
    after, arrest and try members and supporters of the Palestinian Resistance.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of figures, the Oslo accords failed to established the
    PA’s superiority over the self-rule areas which, until now, cover only 30% of the
    total area of the West Bank (5,800 square kilometres) and 60% of the Gaza Strip area (360
    square kilometres). The Israelis kept sovereignty over the border exits, the main roads
    among the West Bank towns and between the West Bank and Gaza, and the natural resources,
    especially the water.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, the Occupation authorities kept the upper hand over the
    security issues in all areas of the West Bank and Gaza. The agreements failed to check the
    ongoing activities of Jewish settlement, which increased significantly during the
    Rabin-Peres and the Netanyahu governments, albeit in varied means.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consecutive waves of settlement resulted in the separation of the
    northern part of the West Bank from its western part and enhanced the separation between
    the West Bank towns. The Israelis are completing their plans to Judaize Jerusalem at all
    levels, making any talks regarding the status of Jerusalem useless. As for the return of
    the refugees and displaced persons, this issue remains within a theoretical framework of
    quadrilateral and multilateral working groups. Israel rejects the return of any
    Palestinian refugee to his home. There was an offer by Israel to allow the return of
    200,000 of the 1967-displaced Palestinians but over a period of 50 years!</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the failure of the Oslo accords in stopping the
    settlement expansions, repatriating the refugees and establishing Palestinian superiority
    over Palestinian land, the PA failed to run the self-rule areas to any degree of
    satisfaction, given that corruption, favouritism, bureaucracy, suppression of the
    Palestinian citizens, and control over the public and press freedoms runs rampant. These
    failures were felt by the Palestinians in and out of the occupied territories.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of the above circumstances came the “4 May”
    issue. The PA tried to cover up its failures by attempting to declare a Palestinian State
    without actually owning any of the real basics of this State. The PA’s objective in
    declaring Statehood was to exert pressure on the Israeli side to implement what remained
    of the Wye River agreement. But the advancing of the Israeli elections stripped the
    PA’s attempt of its essence and power and pushed the self-rule authority to seek and
    obtain American-European promises to support the implementation of the agreements with the
    Israelis and to reach a final resolution with the coming Israeli governments.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within this framework, a meeting was held at the end of April with the
    PLO Central Council. The PA wanted to obtain a cover to postpone the Statehood declaration
    in response to American, European and Arab requests, which the PA succeeded in achieving.
    The Central Council did not declare the State claiming that it was already established in
    1988 by a decision made by the Palestinian National Council at its 19th session. The
    Central Council, however, called for the completion of the elements of this State and its
    institutions even though the PA does not own the mechanism to complete these elements. Nor
    can they be made available under the current agreements because of the continued Israeli
    military, political and economic domination over the self-rule areas. The different
    parties in Israel: reject the establishment of a real Palestinian State; insist on keeping
    Jerusalem the “eternal and unified” capital of the Jewish State; fight to keep
    the Jewish settlements, refusing to dismantle them (except for some small and scattered
    settlements which the Labor Party has no objection to the dismantling as long as it is
    within the framework of the final status settlement); and reject any Palestinian control
    on the border exits and any Palestinian military presence west of the Jordan River.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the declaration of a Palestinian State under the current
    status quo would not form a real achievement, the PA preferred to adjourn it against
    promises to implement the remaining parts of the Wye River agreement, believing that the
    Oslo accords—not the Palestinian People—have become its only choice.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence, 4 May 1999 has passed without the realization of the PA’s
    expectations of the return of the Palestinian territories and its independence. It is
    likely that many similar dates will pass without having these expectations realized
    because the Oslo accords are not the proper mechanism to achieve the goal of liberation
    and independence.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The passing of five years since the Oslo accords without achieving
    anything of essence concerning the Palestinian People and their land is a strong
    indication of the failure of these accords. It again confirms the position and viewpoint
    of the Palestinian forces that oppose the Oslo process. It proves that the resistance
    programme that is based on the right of the Palestinian People to resist the occupation is
    still the only realistic means to restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian People.</p>
