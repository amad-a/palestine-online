    and the Israeli elections</font></h3>
    </b></font><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The peace process in the region is experiencing a new stage
    of freeze after the declaration of early Israeli elections to be held on 17 May 1999<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> 18 months prior to their normal date<font FACE="Symbol">¾</font>
    and after the Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu announced the freezing of the
    implementation of the Wye River agreement claiming that the Palestinian Authority did not
    abide by the provisions of the agreement, especially those related to the security issues.
    </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will become again
    subject to the wavering political life of the Jewish State. The Israeli elections will
    witness attempts to polarize public opinion and gain votes by giving promises.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we review the Israeli elections map, we find that it includes
    various groups, many of which are known rivals, representing all political colours of
    contradicting tendencies. These include: </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Left&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :</b>
    Labour, Meretz, Gesher and the Communist Party<br>
    <b>Right&nbsp; :</b> Likud, Tsomet and Moledet<br>
    <b>Religious&nbsp; :</b> Shas, Agudat Israel and the National Religious Party (Mifdal)<br>
    <b>Centrist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :</b> Centre Party<br>
    <b>Racial&nbsp; :</b> Israel B’aliya (immigrants of Russian origin)<br>
    <b>Arab lists&nbsp; : </b>United Arab List, Hadash (Jewish-Arab communist), the National
    Democratic
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bloc and the New Arab Party</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Israelis may run two electoral rounds: the first to elect members
    of the 120-seat Knesset, while the second will be specialized to elect the Prime Minister
    among the candidates who occupied the first and second position in the first round if none
    of them gains more than 50% of the votes in the first round.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Israeli elections coming up this year has witnessed an apparent
    phenomena, that being the split. At the Right, the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
    succeeded in becoming the Likud’s candidate for the prime ministry elections after
    the Likud lost a number of its prominent leaders such as Dan Mirodor, the former finance
    minister; Ze’ev (Beni) Begin, the Right extremist; and Yitzhaq Mordechai, the former
    defence minister.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the Labour opposition party, it seems that Ehud Barak, chief
    of the party, is the only candidate for the prime ministry elections at the present
    moment.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of the Centre Party by prominent figures such as the
    former Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak, and Mordechai, who left the Likud and who was
    nominated as the new Party’s candidate for the prime ministry elections, as well as
    Roni Melo, the former mayor of Tel Aviv, reflected the deep split inside the Israeli
    society on political and personal grounds.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the fact that the Palestinian Arabs of the 1948-occupied
    Palestine are divided into four lists and despite the fact that a large portion of them
    refrain from supporting any of the lists or even from showing any interest in the
    elections, the members of the lists agree, to a considerable extent, on one objective that
    goes in harmony with the Israeli Left, that is to topple Netanyahu and to take part in any
    Labour government in future. It is expected that Chairman Yasser Arafat will play an
    important role in directing these lists to support the Israeli Left, a thing that seems to
    be the best and only option for the Palestinian Authority.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the Islamic Movement within the 1948-occupied Palestine sector,
    it has declared that it would not run in the Israeli elections, nor would it support any
    candidate. This decision came after the reunion of the Movement following the decision
    made by Abdullah Darwish and his group to return to the Movement under Sheikh Ra’ed
    Salah.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The date of the Israeli elections was advanced after the Right parties
    had abandoned its full support of Netanyahu’s government in the Knesset because it
    signed the Wye River agreement. This situation was seized by the Labour party to press the
    Likud to accept the advancing of the Israeli elections. This indicates the increase of the
    political influence of the extremist Israeli Right. It also shows that Netanyahu has lost
    his known ability to maintain a balance between the continuation of the peace process at
    its lowest level and the appeasing of the extremist Right by suspending the implementation
    of the agreements with the Palestinian Authority.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FF0000">The Peace Process exposed to storms</font></b></u><br>
    Under the present situation, the region seems to be witnessing a period that its basic
    features are difficult to predict given the absence of U.S. pressure on the Israeli
    government to abide by its agreements with the PA. The U.S. Administration cannot exert
    any pressure on the Israeli government because the U.S. President is busy with his
    impeachment trial and because his administration is busy dealing with crises in Iraq and
    the Albanian Kosovo. Moreover, the American role retreated to only the coordination with
    Europe to reach a deal with the Palestinian Authority in order to convince it to postpone
    the declaration of the Palestinian State.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, the options before Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in order to
    win the new elections support possibilities of seeking to enhance his electoral position
    through selective bombings against Lebanon as his predecessor Shimon Peres did before the
    previous elections. On the other hand, Netanyahu will follow a hard-line policy with the
    Palestinian Authority in order to remain in power over the next four years. This means he
    will continue in his position to freeze the Wye River agreement.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many political analysts opine that the peace process has actually
    become exposed to storms and that Netanyahu’s government may resort to a military
    operation, especially after the appointment of Moshe Arens as Defence Minister. Arens is
    known for opposing all agreements with the Palestinians, which increases the possibilities
    of an Israeli military adventure in South Lebanon. The agreements between the Israeli
    government and the PA will continue to be frozen or subject to amendment or rejection in
    future as long as each new Israeli government announces that it is not committed to
    agreements reached by the former government. This shows how fragile the future of the
    peace process really is.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FF0000">PA… declaration of the State… and
    the game of alliance with the Israeli Left</font></b></u><br>
    “The Palestinian leadership will abide by the fourth of May as the date to declare
    the Independent State, and it will not abandon this date,” said Dr. Asaad Abdel
    Rahman, member of the PLO Executive Committee and the one who is in charge of the Refugees
    portfolio, on 23 January. But this issue has become one of the cards being used by the
    Palestinian Authority to influence the Israeli elections. The Labour and the Centre
    parties are seeking to convince the PA to postpone the declaration of the Palestinian
    State until the end of the Israeli elections. Barak and Mordechai fear that the
    declaration of the Palestinian State before the elections will give the Israeli Prime
    Minister Netanyahu a chance to take extremist and hard-line positions, which will make him
    gain more Israeli votes.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the Palestinian Authority, under U.S. and regional
    pressure, will postpone the declaration of the State claiming that it will gain an
    international decisive promise to stop Jewish settlement and to support the Palestinians
    in building an independent state before the end of this year. In addition, the PA is
    hoping that the U.S. Administration and the European Union will guarantee the
    implementation of the Wye River agreement, including the third phase of redeployment of
    the Occupation troops in the West Bank, of which the percentage will be determined during
    negotiations and not by the Israeli government alone.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it seems that the Palestinian Authority will not succeed in
    stopping the Jewish settlements nor will it be able to force the Israeli government to
    implement the Wye River agreement. For the settlement issue cannot be stopped by any
    Israeli government. On the contrary, the survival of any government depends on its support
    of the settlements. As for the implementation of the Wye River agreement, it will depend
    to a large extent on the party that will assume power in the Jewish State. The signed
    agreements will have no real weight but their implementation will depend on the previous
    positions of the Labour and Likud towards these agreements, which focus on the necessity
    to amend their provisions in ways that serve their interests and positions.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Labour’s experience with the implementation of the agreements
    when the Party was in power proved that the Labour role in suspending the implementation
    of the Oslo accords was similar to the Likud’s role in freezing the Wye River
    agreement. The Palestinian Authority has an overall control of only 3% of the West Bank
    and joint control with the Occupation troops of 24%. The settlement activities did not
    stop. On the contrary, they markedly increased without a public fuss such as what happened
    with the Abu Ghneim settlement and the way in which the Likud government dealt with it.
    Labour, under the cover of the economic summits and the normalization of relations with
    the Arabs, was pretending that it abided by the peace process and wanted to give the
    Palestinians their rights. The ‘Grapes of Wrath’ massacre against the Lebanese
    village of Qana in April 1996 was committed by the Labour Party, not the Likud. One of the
    journalists was right when he said the only difference between the Labour and the Likud is
    that the first builds ten settlements but announces only two, while the latter builds ten
    settlements and announces all of them. Moreover, the present leaders of the Labour and the
    Centre parties are hard-liners. Both were chiefs of the Israeli army, which makes the
    political difference between them very small.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the future does not carry good omens for the Palestinian
    Authority. Also, the game being played by the PA in the Israeli arena is a natural result
    of the state of weakness in which the PA has been suffering because of isolating itself
    from the Arab and Islamic world. It is also a result of its policy of fighting the
    resistance option that is being adopted by the Islamic movement in Palestine instead of
    attempting to invest it on the negotiations table.</p>
    <u><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FF0000">The Palestinian Opposition and its role</font></b></u><br>
    If the Palestinian Opposition forces had responded to the nullification of the Palestinian
    National Charter by holding a series of national conferences in the Occupied Territories
    and in Damascus to reach a Palestinian position rejecting the relinquishment of the rights
    of the Palestinian People, would they do anything that might affect the status quo in the
    Palestinian and the Israeli arenas?</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the Palestinian Opposition does not prefer one political
    party to another in the Jewish State whether it is from the Right or the Left. This is
    because the differences between the two are very small and formative. However, their main
    programmes regarding the issues of settlement, Occupied Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees
    and the Palestinian issue are very close in general.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unification of the Palestinian factions and independent figures
    against the nullification of the National Charter, although on a very low scale, opens the
    door for finding a formula of cooperation among the different forces of the Palestinian
    People to revive the spirit of resistance among them away from the calculations of the
    Israeli elections.</p>
