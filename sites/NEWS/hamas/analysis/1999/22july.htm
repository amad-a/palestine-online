mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The newly elected Israeli Premier, Ehud Barak,
      nominated his new ministers recently within the 40-day break given to him.
      He was able to present the outline of his new joint cabinet before the
      Israeli Parliament after he had signed several agreements with his allied
      parties. This cabinet, which consists of both the middle parties and the
      religious ones, won the confidence of Parliament by a majority of 75 out
      of 120 votes on 6 July 1999. The first step carried out by Barak was his
      visit to Egypt to meet President Husni Mubarak in order to resume the
      peace process. He then met the PA chairman, Yasser Arafat, in Gaza and
      King Abdallah II of Jordan. Finally, he departed to the U.S. to meet
      President Bill Clinton.<o:p>

      distribution of these ministries among the members of the Labor Party and
      the appointment of the advisors caused indignant and furious reactions in
      the party because Barak excluded the top five members in the initial
      election such as Yousuf Burgh and Uzy Ber’am while General Mattan
      Felna’e has been waiting for any extension in the Cabinet for the
      future. Moreover, Barak appointed Yussie Belien as a Minister of Justice
      (although he is not a law man) and Abraham Shouhat—one of his closest
      friends—as a Minister of Finance (considered to be one of the major
      ministries), which created indignant reactions among the Labor Party MPs
      because Belien played an important role in Barak’s electoral campaign.
      The matter is the same for Shlomo Ben Amy, who was top in the initial
      elections of the Labor Party and was appointed as Minister of Internal
      Security instead of the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Foreign
      Affairs, which was assigned to David Levy. Barak appointed three advisors
      to his office: Danny Yatoum (the ex-Chief of the Israeli Intelligence) as
      Chief of the political board in order to coordinate the information coming
      from the security systems such as the intelligence unit known as Shabak
      and the Military Intelligence (even though the chiefs of these systems
      prefer to deal with Barak directly and they all have a negative attitude
      toward Yatoum, especially as a result of the failed attempt to assassinate
      Khaled Misha’al, the chief of Hamas political bureau, and because Yatoum
      had not informed them of the detailed plan before it was executed); Haim
      Shkeid (an ex-army officer) as Chief of the Premier’s office; and Tsefy
      Stouber (the advisor who led the electoral campaign of Barak). These
      appointments have been severely criticized by the magnets of the Labor
      Party because they include Barak’s intimate friends and they are not
      competent to hold these positions. These magnets also accused Barak of
      gathering his closest people around him so he would not be alone in making
      any decisions, especially after he deprived all of the influential Labor
      Party MPs from the major ministries such as Defense, Finance and Foreign
      Affairs.<o:p>

      did not appoint any Arab MPs to any ministries or even consult them
      despite the absolute support they gave him during the elections. However,
      he did inform them of the results of his final negotiations after they had
      been completed, which infuriated the Arab MPs who supported Barak with 90%
      of the Arab votes in the Israeli Parliament. This will stop any support by
      these parties for Barak or his future proposals except those which will be
      in favour of the Arab attitude in the negotiations against the Israeli
      Rightist parties in the compromise process.<o:p>

      was to accept the Arab MP, Hashem Mahameed, as a member of the Committee
      of Foreign Affairs and Security in the Israeli Parliament for the first
      time in the history of Israel. This Committee supervises the Israeli
      security systems. However, this is not considered a great achievement for
      the Arabs because two other Arab MPs were candidates for this post and
      their role and influence will be limited as the majority of the members
      are Jews. This indirect support by the Arabs of the Jewish State only
      serves to realize a false democracy with its obvious racism even in the
      territories occupied in 1948.<o:p>

      his predecessor Netanyahu. He then carried out several negotiations with
      Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, PA Chairperson Yasser Arafat, King

      Wye River agreement, he emphasized what had been reported by the Israeli
      mass media that he had been trying to convince Arafat to change his
      attitudes and to apply this agreement gradually and as soon as possible
      because he believed that the full application of this agreement would
      create a lot of trouble which would minimize the chances to realize a

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">This opaque justification of Barak’s attitude toward
      a partial application of the Wye River agreement had been declared by
      Barak’s close advisors who said that Barak wanted to move to the final
      negotiations after applying one stage of the Israeli withdrawal as stated
      in the said agreement under the pretext that the full application of this
      agreement would create more trouble for Barak, and a lot of protests by
      his Rightist allies and the settlers, which was not desirable by him at
      that stage. These sources indicated that during the second round of
      negotiations Barak intended to tempt the Palestinians into postponing the
      application of this agreement in exchange for declaring the Palestinian
      State, according to the Israeli conditions, of course. If we disregard the
      Israeli overt justifications, we realize that the actual reason behind
      postponing this application is to prevent the PA from capturing more land
      in the West Bank, and so the negotiations concerning this stage will be
      carried out during the final negotiations in order to bargain with keeping
      the major colonies and settlements as well. To make this attitude
      different from Netanyahu, Barak showed his desire to finalize all of the
      tracks of the peace process by November of 2000 in addition to the
      declaration of the independent Palestinian State because this date
      coincides with the season of the American elections, which will help the
      Democratic party support their candidate, Al Gore, to win the American
      presidency. Meanwhile, Barak has been benefiting from the American current
      attitude which does not exert any pressures on Israel at this stage in
      order to achieve more progress and make the Arab partners responsible for
      any delay in this respect. In this context, Barak has tried to minimize
      the American role in the peace process on the Palestinian track through
      minimizing the role of the CIA in supervising the execution of the
      agreements to prove that both Palestinians and Israelis are capable of
      performing this role without the interference of the Americans.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">It seems that Barak has been trying to minimize any
      American role that would exert any pressure on his Cabinet in the future
      and to outline the peace process with the Palestinians for the American
      partnership but not with their close supervision of the details of this
      process as was the case during Netanyahu’s reign. In addition, he
      considers himself able to convince the Americans of what he presented to
      the Palestinians and to get the necessary American support for his
      security considerations and demands which are quite essential for the
      continuity of the peace process. Barak has finally obtained American aid
      for his security demands by signing another security agreement with the
      them in order to form a joint committee concerned with the security issues
      of the two countries as well as promoting cooperation between them in the
      fields of defense, rockets, missiles, weapons of mass destruction and
      purchasing 50 F-16 advance American fighters. In addition to this absolute
      American support for his security demands, Barak insists that the PA has
      to be committed to the security demands as shown in the agreement; this is
      exactly what Barak emphasized to Arafat when they met at Airies Barrier in
      Gaza, and he will be more determined than the previous rulers in this
      respect. Also, unless the PA helps resist the so-called terrorism, he will
      cancel the peace process altogether. Moreover, Barak suggested that a
      47-kilometre overpass, including a motorway and a railway, should be built
      to connect Gaza and the West Bank so the Palestinians do not pass through
      the territories occupied in 1948.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The advent of Barak has created a wave of optimism
      among Arab countries and the PA, but the Palestinians have been more
      reserved this time because Barak has emphasized the Syrian track in the
      peace process which has made the Syrians remarkably positive in their
      reactions. The PA has been doubtful of Barak’s using the game of tracks
      in order to delay the final compromise on the Palestinian track and weaken
      the attitude of the PA in the negotiations. This game was played by the
      Israeli ex-Premier, Yitzhaq Rabin, who succeeded in blackmailing a lot of
      deference and yielding from the PA. Consequently, the statements made by
      the Palestinian officials lately have emphasized the fact that the real
      yardstick for Barak’s intentions is the practical application.
      Meanwhile, the PA has rejected any combination between the Wye River
      agreement and the final agreement, which could be parallel to each other,
      and the third stage of the Israeli withdrawal whose percentage should be
      decided later on. Undoubtedly, the beginning of the negotiations of the
      final solution before fulfilling the demands of the previous stage will
      weaken the Palestinian attitude even if the PA insists on rejecting to
      combine the Wye River agreement with the final negotiations. This will
      definitely lead to greater Israeli superiority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Israelis have been procrastinating in applying the agreements.
      Consequently, the PA will have only one option: combining the delayed
      matters with the final negotiations. The PA’s attitude will be weaker in
      the light of the new merge between the Syrian and the Israeli attitude,
      especially the strong desire among the Syrians to make Barak fulfill the
      Syrian-Israeli peace treaty, withdraw his forces from Lebanon and settle
      the Arab-Israeli conflict by withdrawing from most of the occupied Golan
      Heights.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">The variety of Arab welcomings for Barak, the show of
      support expressed by Egyptian President Husni Mubark when he asked
      everyone to give Barak a two-month break in order to be able to fulfill
      his promises, and the unusual American arrangements for Barak’s late
      visit to Washington make us believe that Barak will have more
      manoeuvrability in keeping his acceptable and good image among the Arabs
      even though he did not fulfill his commitments in the peace process. <o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">On the other hand, Syria has been the most hopeful Arab
      country in terms of making peace with the advent of Barak. This was made
      clear in a statement made by Syrian President Hafiz Al-Asad to the English
      writer, Patrick Seal, who recently visited both Damascus and Tel Aviv
      where he met both Al-Asad and Barak before the latter formed his Cabinet.
      It was for the first time in the history of Syrian diplomacy that the
      Syrian President volunteered to talk directly about Israel and the Israeli
      Premier, Barak, describing him as truthful and powerful and who is keen on
      making peace with Syria but in a well-planned and well-studied approach.
      Thereafter, the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded positively to
      Barak’s speech of confidence before the Israeli Parliament, showing the
      readiness of Syrians to fulfill the peace agreement as soon as possible,
      describing it “within their reach.” Although Barak did not declare his
      plans to apply the Wye River agreement, one of his advisors announced in
      Washington that he intended to present a limited initiative within a few
      weeks, which shows that Barak is quite concerned with fulfilling the peace
      agreement on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, although he did not express
      any commitment to withdraw from the Golan Heights, an issue Syria has been
      appealing for since 1967. On the contrary, he emphasized that Israel would
      never withdraw to the borders of 4 June 1967, which is against the Syrian
      demands; in addition, Barak still rejects any Syrian forces on the banks
      of Lake Tiberias for security considerations. <o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">There are no indications in Barak’s policy concerning
      any radical change in the Israeli policies toward the Palestinian Cause
      because the red lines still exist on the Palestinian level. The new
      Israeli Cabinet will be different from the previous one only in its
      tactics and its detailed attitude.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Although Barak has emphasized that he would not build
      any new colonies or remove the existing ones, he gave an oral assurance to
      his allies—Mefdal (the party of the settlers)—to support the colonial
      projects in Abu Ghneim and Ma’aleih Adumim. In addition, a report by the
      Israeli Peace Now Movement showed that the process of construction is
      being continued in the settlements, which were built during Netanyahu’s
      reign, and it accused the new Cabinet of following its predecessor’s
      steps.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Barak’s agreement to the independent State is just in
      words as long as he has put certain conditions which make this State
      unreal, such as the issue of Jerusalem and the refugees. As a result, his
      attitudes are identical to his predecessor, Netanyahu. Under such
      conditions, this optimism concerning Barak and his policies is not based
      on objectivity except the justification of following his footsteps which
      leads to immense and free deference and a yielding attitude on the part of
      the Arabs and Palestinians. Moreover, the separation of the negotiation
      tracks as approved at the Madrid Conference will lead to more
      deterioration in the Arab attitudes as long as each Arab State deals with
      the peace process separately according to its own interests in order to
      sign a peace treaty with Israel, regardless of the so-called just peace on
      the other tracks. Waiting for the results of the negotiations on the
      Lebanese and Syrian tracks, the Arab States will remain optimistic about
      Barak just to give him the chance to fulfill his promises. However, the
      reality is that these promise are no different from the promises given by
      his predecessor, Netanyahu, especially concerning the Palestinian
      Cause—the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict.<o:p>
