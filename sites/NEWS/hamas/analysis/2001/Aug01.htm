      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Zionists, ever since outbreak of the Aqsa
      intifada on 28/9/2001, have been preoccupied in thinking of plans,
      programs and mechanisms by which they could confront escalation of
      Palestinian intifada and resistance. The Zionist political street,
      horrified by continuation of resistance operations, was primarily
      concerned with the position towards the Palestinian Authority and its
      chief Yasser Arafat.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Sharon’s stand towards the PA</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The former Barak
      government had evaded evaluating or voicing certain descriptions of the PA
      and preferred to continue negotiating with it while the intifada was
      flaring. Yet Sharon and his government had another view, considering the
      PA “a terrorist entity”. They preferred indulging in security rather
      than political talks with the PA opining that political negotiations could
      not be made with the PA before it was politically “rehabilitated” and
      before it renounced violence as means for negotiations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon, who promised his
      people to regain them security within 100 days of assuming premiership,
      was compelled to search for a party to be held responsible for running the
      intifada and resistance operations. This was particularly important
      because his program for political talks with the PA was not expected to
      win success because it offered a gradual and limited implementation of
      transitional issues especially the third re-deployment stage while
      postponing the issues of refugees and Al-Quds (Jerusalem) in the final
      status talks to an indefinite date.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As long as the PA would
      not accept Sharon’s program, because its ceiling was much less than that
      offered by his predecessor Barak, Sharon sought to steer his political and
      media efforts to attacking the PA and charging it with what he called
      “terrorism” in addition to ignoring its security role stipulated in
      the Oslo agreements. This was meant to throw the ball in the PA’s court
      and focus the efforts on the security question in its capacity as the only
      means for initiation of political negotiations. Sharon, his government and
      army described the PA and its chief as no longer a “partner” in the
      peace process, called Arafat “a liar” and “deceitful” in addition
      to charging him of supporting and encouraging “terrorism”, compared
      him to “Ben Laden” and finally considered the positive aspects of
      Arafat’s absence from the arena as more than the negative ones as far as
      the Zionist entity was concerned.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Reality of Sharon’s threats to the PA</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The occupation
      government’s frank and clear expression that its army had planned
      practical schemes to wipe out the PA was voiced after escalation of
      resistance attacks and failure of the so-called “ceasefire
      agreements”, which were drafted under American patronage, in limiting
      those attacks and the PA’s clear inability to shoulder the Zionists’
      desired security role.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The question here is how
      serious are the Sharon government’s threats? And whether they are true
      warning or merely leaked to the media to pressure the PA?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We must first of all point
      out that Sharon government’s stance vis-&agrave;-vis the peace process
      had led to complete stoppage in political talks and concentration on
      security negotiations that focused on the Tenet doctrine. This is what the
      Sharon government wants exactly, namely to draw the attention away from
      its obstinacy and intransigence and to focus the international attention
      on the security situation and the Zionist demands to halt the intifada and
      resistance. No doubt the Zionist government’s formation, which leans
      towards extreme right, has boosted such a trend especially when the labor
      party ministers led by Peres have accepted to be executors of Sharon’s
      policies in an attempt to preserve their popularity after losing the last
      Knesset elections.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon and his government
      do not view the PA as a real “partner” contrary to the Barak
      government that maintained political negotiations with the PA until its
      last moments. Sharon is still retaining his old view of the PLO since the
      Beirut war and refused to change it in addition to the fact that his views
      coincide with those of the fanatic religious parties in the Zionist
      government. Even in the cases in which Sharon agreed to engage in
      political talks with the PA, he aimed at exploiting his foreign minister
      Shimon Peres in dragging the PA into accepting his security demands. He
      also wished to preserve continuation of the present coalition government
      and not gamble his possible loss in the event he ignored Peres’ constant
      proposals to meet Arafat. Moreover, Peres’ continuation as the enemy’s
      foreign minister would greatly contribute in lessening the international
      criticism of that government for Peres could market the right
      government’s policies through his special media capabilities and the
      status he enjoys in the West as a “peace monger”.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon’s stand towards
      the PA was boosted after Zionist security agencies, especially the
      military intelligence, considered that PA chief was directly responsible
      for escalation of resistance operations against occupation and that he was
      intentionally ignoring them or even giving indirect orders for Fatah and
      other organizations to launch more operations. This role makes his
      presence at head of the PA a danger to the Zionist entity particularly
      when he controls all areas under his rule, according to those agencies.
      However, Zionist internal intelligence (Shabak) had a different viewpoint
      since it considered Arafat’s control on his areas was not absolute and
      that he was exerting efforts to end the intifada but the Palestinian
      internal situation and political conditions did not help him. The surprise
      was in publishing the new Shabak reports last October stipulating that
      Arafat’s absence from the arena carried more benefit than harm for the
      Zionist entity. Hebrew papers carried last July details of the reports
      including reasons that led to considering Arafat as an assistant factor in
      solving the historic dispute and reasons making him a barrier in the path
      of a peace settlement. In an eye-catching conclusion, the reports set five
      reasons for retaining Arafat and 17 reasons to get rid of him! Among the
      most important reasons for retaining him were “his position as a higher
      authority for Palestinians, his ability to adopt difficult resolutions and
      to challenge the Islamists’ control and that without him chaos would
      prevail.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Meanwhile, the most
      important reasons for getting rid of him were: “he is a dangerous
      leader” and “does not enjoy enough credibility” with the Zionists
      and could lead the region to a catastrophe and could threaten collapse of
      relations with Egypt and Jordan in addition to endangering stability of
      those two countries” and he was still depending on “terrorism” as
      means to achieve his goals and that “he did not wish to offer
      concessions on central issues.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Apparently, those
      speculations were not limited to Zionist security agencies and far-right
      groups as Barak in a recent conference in Tel Aviv University, reported by
      Zionist daily ‘Ma’ariv’ on 11 July admitted that the “Oslo march
      has collapsed”. He also held Arafat “responsible for the collapse of
      the Oslo march”. Barak supported the Sharon government’s policies
      saying, “I agree with the work principles led by Sharon and Ben Eliazer”.
      In another interview published by ‘Newsweek’ and ‘Washington Post’
      on 15 July Barak renewed his backing to the Sharon government’s policy
      and the possibility of launching a large-scale ground operation against
      the PA but he proposed that “it should not be carried out unless as a
      last resort and after Israel wins international support for such an
      operation.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As far as the Zionist
      popular mood was concerned, a recent opinion poll conducted by Gallup
      institute and published in daily ‘Ma’ariv’ on 20/7 reported that 55%
      of Zionists were generally satisfied with performance of their premier
      Ariel Sharon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is clear from the
      aforementioned that intransigence was prevailing in the Zionist street and
      parties along with the wish to direct a strong blow to the PA. This
      furnished the Sharon government with fertile grounds to persist in
      escalation and aggression schemes against the Palestinian people. Hence,
      leaking the occupation army’s plans to the press could not only be
      considered as a test balloon for the PA but rather a reflection of true
      plans that are being seriously studied with certain parts being actually
      carried out.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Dimensions of the war against the Palestinian
      people</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There is a noticeable
      difference here between Sharon government’s continuation in directing
      violent blows to intifada and resistance cadres in addition to a number of
      PA security headquarters and between waging an all-out war that aims at
      destroying and terminating presence of the PA. This last trend is governed
      by a number of considerations on the part of the Zionists:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The effectiveness and
      feasibility of that procedure in terminating Palestinian resistance and
      will it end-up in finding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>other
      forces, closer to the Zionists and to their demands, to take over power?
      Will the new Authority or its leadership be able to control things and
      bypass the expected differences within the Fatah organization and between
      Fatah and other security forces or among those forces themselves? What is
      the impact of all this on the intifada and resistance?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Will such a resolution win
      American approval in the light of estimates that no such measure could be
      taken without an American green light?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What is the expected Arab
      reaction and will it lead to Zionist battles with neighboring Arab
      countries? And what will be the effect of all that on the peace treaties
      signed with some Arab countries?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What will be the nature of
      international reactions and will they lead to internationalizing the
      conflict or will the USA be able to curb European reactions?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Shabak report though
      considering it more likely that secular forces that are closer to the
      Zionists would take over power after fall of Arafat’s Authority, yet it
      did not answer the question about the American stand. The Americans are
      not ready to accept a plan that could endanger the whole region’s
      security, diminish American hegemony over the area and weaken influence of
      pro-America Arab countries. The plan could also lead those countries to
      war against the Zionists after canceling the peace treaties with the
      Zionist entity under popular pressures. Some Arab countries, especially
      Syria, Egypt and Iraq, might get involved in such a confrontation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Developments in the
      occupied territories and the probable spread in confrontations with
      occupation forces leading to greater casualties in their lines pushed the
      enemy’s government to retain the situation as is. It also favored
      increasing the strikes against the Palestinian people and damaging PA’s
      infrastructure especially those of the police force that was charged of
      participating or supporting resistance operations against the Zionist
      entity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Sharon government was
      greatly hesitant in endorsing the plan to wipe out the PA in view of its
      massive ramifications. The ‘Foreign Report’ said on 12/7 that the
      occupation army had presented a plan to the government recently envisaging
      an all-out military operation against the PA.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Latest developments
      including the assassination of big numbers of intifada and resistance
      activists and expanding the scope of assassinations to include political
      figures from Hamas as what happened in the city of Nablus when two
      prominent Hamas leaders (Jamal Mansour and Jamal Salim) were assassinated
      point out that Sharon had changed his plan to exterminate the PA into
      another comprehensive escalatory scheme, though gradual one, against all
      forces of the Palestinian people in addition to the PA. Sharon’s new
      plot targets driving the PA to surrender and weakening and exhausting
      capabilities of the resistance factions to furnish the way before the PA
      to accept occupation dictates and conditions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Sharon government
      through gradual implementation of that plan could reduce the international
      community’s negative reaction to its savage operations and consequently
      help the American administration to continue in providing a suitable
      political cover and preventing success of any European initiative to
      condemn those operations or passing resolutions against them at the
      Security Council. The American stand was noticeably hesitant in denouncing
      the recent Nablus operation, which indicates that such operations must
      have secured an American green light.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, graduating
      Zionist aggressive measures against the Palestinian people would prolong
      life of the Zionist coalition government. Sharon’s all-out war against
      the Palestinians and destroying the PA in the face of an opposition on the
      part of Peres and his labor comrades to such type of war would lead to
      disintegration of the government, which both parties (Likud and Labor) are
      keen on its continuation in the present stage. Peres actually tried to
      dissuade the Sharon government against carrying out the plan to terminate
      the PA tabling a foreign ministry report in the process, which affirmed
      that Arafat was exerting real efforts to halt the intifada. However, the
      report noted that success of Arafat’s attempt necessitated Zionist
      government political initiatives aimed at resuming negotiations and
      implementing the third stage of the re-deployment plan. Although Sharon
      refused to discuss this report at the pretext that it would carry negative
      impact on the government’s stand towards the PA but he might have been
      convinced to postpone the army’s plan or at least amend its timing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">However, the question here
      is: What will the Zionist reaction be to a big martyrdom operation that
      might take place in the coming days?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There are certain
      estimates that Sharon would seize the opportunity to launch his sweeping
      aggression against the PA and the Palestinian people and would ignore the
      aforementioned considerations. There are no enough indications to support
      such an expectation with the exception of the well-known nature of Sharon
      who some say did not change since 1982. In spite of all that the
      repercussions of the comprehensive operation would still remain colossal
      and carry negative effects on the enemy that would make Sharon and others
      think twice before embarking on it.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF">Confronting Sharon’s government and its
      escalation</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The PA showed hesitance
      towards Sharon despite its conviction that it would not achieve any
      political gains with him in power and despite its continuous attempts to
      bring his downfall and persuade the Zionist street to elect a less fanatic
      leader. Apparently the security and military pressures in addition to
      diplomacy contributed in weakening the PA’s position in the face of
      Zionist arrogance and aggression. This led to absence of a unified
      political program for all forces of the Palestinian people that would be
      in harmony with the field unity on the ground, which was achieved through
      unanimity on resistance program. The Arab countries failure to unite on a
      strategy to deal with the Zionist entity and to support the Palestinian
      people and their resistance further weakened the PA. Probably some Arab
      countries even exercised pressures on the PA to accept Tenet’s proposals
      and conditions of the so-called ceasefire.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In return, the Palestinian
      arena witnessed an unprecedented unity on the resistance program. Such a
      stand was actualized on the ground through escalation of armed attacks
      against Zionist settlers and the increase in operations against Zionist
      targets within the 1967 occupied lands and in the Zionist depth. Moreover,
      other major Palestinian organizations shared in such operations
      particularly the Fatah Movement and the Popular Front in addition to Hamas
      and Islamic Jihad, which signaled a big change in favor of the resistance
      option. This was also evident in the angry masses’ demonstration in Gaza
      Strip who were protesting against certain elements of the PA security men
      for shooting at Mujahideen while returning from an operation that fired
      mortar shells at Zionist settlements near Gaza.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Hence, the enemy’s
      government choice to escalate war against the Palestinian people would not
      put an end to Palestinian resistance. Even if certain Palestinian parties
      would be preoccupied in the event PA leaders were absented from the arena,
      this would not affect in the long run the continuation of resistance.
      Maybe it would even lead to its escalation and development after things
      get squared out because any future Palestinian leadership would not be
      able to defy the resistance determination that is deeply rooted in the
      Palestinian people.</p>
