      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is true that Ariel
      Sharon’s significant victory over his contender Ehud Barak posed as a
      Zionist referendum towards the settlement process especially the final
      status issues. However, the ensuing formation of a Zionist national unity
      government on the basis of Sharon’s program along with wiping out all
      understandings reached in the Camp David II and Taba served as the mercy
      bullet that finished off the settlement process and initiated a state of
      war against Palestinians and Arabs. This program could be only confronted
      through escalation of the intifada and all forms of resistance to eject
      occupation from the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Sharon and the unity government
      … pointers and indications</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The election of the mass
      murderer General Sharon with 25 points more than the other mass murderer
      General Barak did not merely end confidence in the latter as some tried to
      picture the matter. Sharon’s sweeping victory was an indication that the
      Zionist street was heading towards more extremism and fanaticism, which
      that man can express more than any other. Consequently the mass murderer
      of Sabra and Chatilla and commander of the Zionist terrorism gangs won a
      big endorsement by the Zionist street never dreamt of by many leaders of
      the Hebrew state since its creation. The authorization was given to Sharon
      to quell the intifada after his predecessor failed in this mission. In
      other words the Zionist street panicked by the intifada and resistance
      wanted to restore its lost security on both the individual and collective
      levels especially when the Aqsa intifada had led to the killing of scores
      of Zionists and wounding of hundreds other than the thousands who call on
      psychiatric clinics following the return of booby-trapped car explosions
      in Tel Aviv, Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and Khadera.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">No doubt the other message
      addressed through Sharon’s election was the Zionist stand towards the
      settlement process namely rejecting all proposals over Al-Quds and the
      refugees, which were tackled in the Camp David II and Taba negotiations
      and which paved the way for Barak government’s downfall in the Knesset
      and Barak’s subsequent defeat in the premiership elections. Consequently
      results of the election represented a Zionist referendum on understandings
      of the final status talks and dealt a coup de grace to the Oslo agreement
      that was staggering in the past years and entered the stage of clinical
      death following the Aqsa intifada.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The intifada had started
      an alarm bell in the Zionist entity while the elections broke loose its
      extremism and wish of imposing hegemony on the Palestinian people. For its
      part, formation of the national unity government with the approval of the
      two big parties and with participation of most Zionist parties, if not
      all, amalgamated all elements of force in the Zionist society in face of
      an unarmed people that only owned solid belief in victory by the grace of
      Allah and in justice of its cause and rights in addition to strong
      determination and support of the Arab and Islamic Nation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Labor party’s
      approval to participate in the national unity government with the Likud
      reflected the Zionist street’s aspirations and wishes. It furthermore
      achieved the party’s interests and aspirations after it started to
      suffer from internal disintegration and retreat in its political program
      based on realizing a settlement with the Palestinian side ensuring Zionist
      security. The Labor party, through participating in one government with
      the Likud based on a stringent political program, is trying to beautify
      its image before the Zionist street. The participation could further be in
      response to the US Jewish lobby’s wishes and the American
      administration’s inclinations that did not want to leave Sharon rule
      supreme and drag the region into a state of instability.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As for Sharon, his
      alliance with the Labor party would ensure persistence of his government
      more than allying with religious and rightist parties. It would also
      present him in a better image before the Palestinians, Arabs and the
      world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>The national unity
      government’s program is based on the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="disc">
        <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Continuation of the settlement process and
          commitment to signed agreements.</li>
        <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Conclusion of transitory accords with the
          Palestinians rather than final agreements.</li>
        <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Introduction of changes on redeployment in the West
          Bank and Gaza Strip.</li>
        <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Non-establishment of new settlements unless both
          major parties in the coalition agreed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The program clearly
      realizes Sharon’s demands, which declare that he would only abide by
      signed agreements and which consider understandings reached in Camp David
      II and Taba as non-binding. The new American administration supported that
      step. The program further ignores importance of reaching a final agreement
      in the near future as Barak had sought but rather concentrates on
      transitory accords. Such a shift would prolong negotiations for many years
      to come and would change understandings reached over Al-Quds and the
      refugees in addition to reducing the third redeployment stage to the
      minimum. As for the settlements, the program did not prevent its fattening
      or expanding, which is enough for Sharon who was the one that called for
      planting “political” settlements everywhere in the Palestinian lands.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Sharon government … and the
      intifada</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The most important issue
      in the government’s program was the one dealing with means of
      confronting the intifada. There is<span dir="RTL" style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Traditional Arabic&quot;"> </span>a
      general consensus on continuing security measures including use of maximum
      force against intifada activities and persecution of Palestinian
      activists. However, Sharon is also seeking to expand the list of
      liquidation to group senior officials in the Palestinian Authority if the
      Zionists found out they were involved in encouraging or planning
      resistance operations. He is also of the opinion that personal and
      economic interests of PA leaderships should be endangered to pressure them
      into restoring security coordination to its former level and to employ its
      influence to calm down the intifada. Sharon already started his previous
      program through tightening the economic siege on PA areas. Zionist chief
      of Staff Shaul Mofaz also charged that the PA was turning into a terrorist
      entity, a statement that was backed by Sharon. The statement paves the way
      for leveling selective strikes against a number of PA figures or
      reoccupying certain PA controlled areas for a period of time so as to
      execute terrorist operations in them. Despite the reservations voiced by
      Peres (foreign minister in Sharon’s government) towards Mofaz’s
      statement, yet Sharon is determined to strengthen his security grip on the
      intifada. Sharon intends to turn his defense minister Benjamin Ben Eliazer,
      chosen by the Labor party to the post, into a repressive tool to quell the
      intifada especially when Eliazer is considered one of the right wing
      within the Labor party and his ideas are close to those of Sharon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">However, Sharon does not
      own any magical (terrorist) solutions to end the intifada despite his
      repeated threats to wipe it out. He would be no more bloodthirsty than his
      predecessor Barak who failed to stop the intifada and the resistance.
      Furthermore, any more tightening in the security and economic siege on the
      Palestinian people might lead to the political and economic collapse of
      the PA, a matter not favored by any Zionist government because the
      alternative would be facing all Palestinian forces without any commitment
      or control in addition to shouldering burdens of occupation anew, which
      would be far more costly than the current situation that followed the Oslo
      agreements. Hence, Sharon is not expected to occupy the Palestinian
      self-rule areas but rather to corner the PA in them without allowing it to
      expand control over other areas even within transitory accords. Sharon
      also would not give up political negotiations through which he would try
      to drag the PA into resuming security coordination under the pretext of
      winning political and economic gains in return.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">The required Palestinian and
      Arab stand</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon’s election and
      formation of a national unity government reflected the Zionist stand
      towards the settlement process and the intifada. In return the Palestinian
      stand should be based on ending all forms of negotiations with the enemy,
      which only understood the language of force and only submitted to armed
      threat and gun smoke especially when the political settlement process
      failed to restore the Palestinian people’s rights and failed to convince
      the Zionist street to recognize the minimum limit of Palestinian
      aspirations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The intifada must be
      escalated and the anti-occupation struggle methods must be developed to
      confirm the Palestinian people insistence on their rights under all
      circumstances and to declare that Zionist terrorism and iron-fist policy
      would not affect the Palestinian people’s determination or lessen their
      insistence on ejecting occupation from their lands. What is required here
      is a Palestinian national program of confrontation against occupation that
      does not limit itself to coordinating or organizing intifada activities
      but rather should comprise a political program of confrontation on the
      basis of resistance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Palestinian people
      have proven great ability of steadfastness and sacrifice regardless of the
      elapse of time or big losses. Thus the Palestinian people won support of
      the Arab and Islamic world and forced the enemy to accord them special
      attention. The Palestinian leadership should live up to the people’s
      will, give up the Oslo program, set the interests of the people above its
      own interests and lead a national unity program in a way achieving the
      Palestinian people’s aspirations and furnishing the road for a real
      Arab-Islamic interaction with the intifada and resistance. Such a
      situation would improve the official Arab stance driving it into adopting
      and supporting the resistance program with all available potentials.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon does not wish to
      develop the dispute in the region into an all-out war with the Arab
      countries because the international situation does not allow it and
      because such a scenario does not serve the Jewish entity that is trying to
      merge into its surroundings and not get more isolated. At the same time,
      the Arab countries’ stands do not differ from Sharon’s wish due to
      internal and external calculations. However, the possibility of war
      breaking out or limited clashes between the enemy’s army and each of
      Syria and Iraq or even Iran still remains lingering. Thus the Arab
      countries should be prepared for such a scenario and not remain captive to
      fears of such a development. They should also back the Palestinian
      people’s struggle program considering it the advanced defense line of
      the Arab Nation and a constant attrition of the enemy.</p>
