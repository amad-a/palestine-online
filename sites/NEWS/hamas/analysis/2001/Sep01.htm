      <p class="MsoBodyText">The USA has played a pivotal role in international
      politics after the Second World War. This role gained added importance and
      centrality after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the socialist
      bloc countries represented in the Warsaw Pact. Hence the USA became the
      sole leader of the world. The entire world has become relatively governed
      by results of the American elections and the consequent changes in the new
      administration’s economic, military and political policies. This has a
      direct impact on the Middle East situation and the American handling of
      the Arab-Zionist conflict. Which means that parties to this conflict have
      to take into account the prevailing American political atmosphere when
      setting their agendas<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to
      realize their goals.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">Constants
      and variables in American policy:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The USA is essentially a
      two party democracy where the Republican and Democratic parties take turns
      in power, the change of party in power entails a change of the
      administration team. This alteration is normally followed by a change in
      policies despite the absence of essential differences between the two
      parties in political tenets. The president’s personality, his team and
      their political, economic and social beliefs greatly reflect on the
      overall policy of the administration. The American voters are more
      concerned with internal issues such as social insurance, taxes and
      economic policies than any other question.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As for the foreign policy:
      it is governed by USA’s fundamental interests and any change in this
      policy is linked to American interests in the world in addition to
      internal considerations in the American society and influence of pressure
      groups.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The American international
      policy is based on certain interests that envisage boosting the
      country’s international status in a way preserving its pioneering role
      in leading the world. It seeks to maintain America as the sole power
      ruling supreme on global politics and economy. It also seeks to retain the
      state of military supremacy through developing defensive and military
      capabilities to ensure its hegemony while endeavoring to neutralize
      military potentials of other big countries.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>American
      policy in the Middle East is based on four vital interests:</b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Oil: the Middle East,
      especially the Arab Gulf countries, is the main source of oil supplies to
      the USA. This is the lifeline of the American economic activity where
      American machines consume 30% of world oil despite the fact that its
      population constitutes no more than 6% of the world population.
      Furthermore, oil is the most important international commodity on demand
      and has no alternative at times of peace and of vital strategic importance
      at times of war.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Water routes: the
      Middle East controls a group of the most important water routes in the
      world including the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Arab Gulf if Turkey
      is excluded. The region thus gains added military, strategic and economic
      importance since most of the oil trade and others pass through those water
      routes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Preserving the Zionist
      entity’s security, existence and supremacy in various spheres in its
      capacity as the West’s advanced base in the Middle East especially after
      the USA took over leadership of western colonialism from Britain.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- The region, especially
      the Gulf States, is and essential market for American goods that helps
      keep the American industrial machine running. The region is considered the
      biggest importer of American arms, an industry that supports many other
      industries.<b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">Based
      on these interests constant American policies were drawn, most important
      of which:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- The establishment of
      strategic alliances in the region that work for protecting and realizing
      American interests. They would serve as advanced basis for the USA in the
      region. The most preferred state in the region for that mission is the
      Zionist entity, yet the USA is keen on maintaining its alliance with Egypt
      and continuation of its assistance to that Arab country in a way almost
      equaling the aid presented to the Zionist entity to ensure retaining Egypt
      as a satellite to American policy in the region.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">2- Guaranteeing freedom of navigation in waterways
      for American navy and commercial vessels. This is one of the reasons for
      the presence of American forces in the Gulf and Red Sea waters since the
      Iraqi-Iranian war.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Ensuring stability in
      the region so that no Arab-Zionist dispute would turn into a comprehensive
      regional war, since such a probability would threaten the USA’s vital
      interests in the region.<b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>The variable policies</b>
      deal with the means and mechanisms that contribute to protecting American
      vital interests or the partial interests linked to them. American
      economic, political and military pressures fall under this category with
      the aim of realizing specific goals. Those pressures are coupled with
      political initiatives and related negotiating tactics on various issues.
      The team that deals with the Middle East crisis in the American
      administration sets out these polices.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">American
      policy from Clinton to Bush:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The American involvement
      in the Arab-Zionist conflict reached a peak during the reign of president
      Clinton when the peace process occupied the topmost priority in the
      American foreign policy. All political settlements to the conflict were
      signed under the supervision and patronage of Clinton and his
      administration. Those efforts reached a climax in the Camp David summit
      (2) in a bid to end the conflict after which Clinton concluded his efforts
      in what came to be known as Clinton’s paper that was tabled at the end
      of Barak’s rule.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">During those years, the
      USA employed all means available to impose a peaceful settlement to end
      decades of Arab-Zionist conflict. However, those colossal efforts that
      included the personal involvement of Clinton only led to partial
      agreements essentially on security issues. Those efforts reached a
      deadlock and the possibility of concluding a comprehensive settlement
      faded away after eruption of the Aqsa intifada and election of Sharon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Under these circumstances,
      American president Bush Jr. took over the presidency with a new Republican
      administration that started an evaluation of the American performance in
      the Middle East especially regarding the Arab-Zionist conflict to benefit
      from experience of the Clinton administration. The new American
      administration’s performance in dealing with political developments in
      the Middle East was confused in the absence of a clear vision. More often
      than not conflicting statements were voiced by officials of the new
      administration towards the crises in addition to political and field
      developments especially between vice president Dick Cheney and secretary
      of state Powell. However, features of the American policies started to
      take shape after figures and parties specialized in Middle East affairs
      started to draft those policies. Observers and analysts noted that the
      core of the American policy towards parties to that conflict have not
      changed, however the involvement in the details when dealing with crisis
      in the region that was prevalent during the Clinton administration has
      disappeared.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">Features
      of the new American policy in the region:</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- The assumption that the
      Zionist entity is the main pillar to guarantee the USA’s interests in
      the region. The American-Zionist alliance in words and deeds is the main
      effective tool in the Middle East and is the solid base for America’s
      plans and policies in the region. Consequently that relationship should
      never suffer from tension. Furthermore, relations with Arab countries in
      the region should not come anywhere near the special relations that the
      USA and the Zionist entity have.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Easing American
      administration’s direct intervention in the region’s crises and
      explaining to both parties that the USA’s interest in a final settlement
      between the two parties is limited and that any real American interference
      should be based on two factors:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A-Both parties should ask
      for American intervention asking for settlement proposals, thus pointing
      out that negotiations are the responsibility of both parties and America
      is not a party to that.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">B-The two parties must
      pledge to accept the tabled formulas.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- The presidency should
      be kept aloof from dealing with the crisis to preserve its esteem leaving
      the mission to the state department in addition to activating role of the
      CIA. In general, the administration prefers reducing the rank of American
      employees involved in dealing with Middle Eastern crises.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- There should be
      absolute keenness not to escalate the crises into regional war and
      pressures should be practiced on various parties to avoid such a
      possibility. Pressures must involve all available methods to halt security
      deterioration in Palestine and bring back both parties to the negotiating
      table.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- The friendly Arab
      countries should continue to table political initiatives to settle the
      conflict even if the initiatives’ success opportunity was slim because
      otherwise a political vacuum would occur in the region leading to
      escalation of events.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- Pressures would
      continue on the Palestinian Authority to return to its security role and
      to vow to return to the negotiating table in its capacity as the sole mean
      of settling the conflict with the Zionist entity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">7- Pressures would be also
      exerted on Syria to calm down the South Lebanon’s front and curb
      Hizbullah’s moves. At the same time Washington would declare absolute
      support to any Zionist measure against Syria or Lebanon in retaliation to
      Hizbullah attacks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">8- There should be
      clear-cut separation of the Arab-Zionist conflict from the relations with
      the Gulf countries to ensure America’s oil interests in the Arabian
      Peninsula in their capacity as two different strategic files with each
      having its own policies and plans that should not be mixed up.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">9- Pressures must be
      maintained on countries rebelling against American hegemony topped by
      Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Sudan.<b><o:p>

      American policy in dealing with the current crisis:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Coping with the
      aforementioned political broad lines, the new American policy can be
      summarized in the following points:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Intensifying American
      secret and declared pressures on the PA to return it to its security role
      in favor of occupation through the following methods:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">a) Holding the PA directly
      responsible for escalation of events and demanding more efforts to end the
      intifada and return to negotiations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">b) Dealing with Arafat’s
      visit to Washington as a pressure card to offer more political and field
      concessions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">c) Activating a number of
      Arab countries to pressure the PA into claming things down.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">d) The Congress’
      condemnation of the PA, charging it of backing terrorism and threatening
      to label the PLO as a terrorist organization and barring American
      assistance to the PA.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Involving the PA in
      understandings and initiatives to abort the intifada politically, to lower
      ceiling of its demands, from one of independence and liberation to
      marginal questions, and to deal with the crisis as a security problem.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Seeking to strip the
      Palestinian party from its source of strength (resistance) and returning
      it to the negotiating table in a weaker position than before on the basis
      of renouncing violence as means of achieving political goals.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Avoiding any
      condemnation of the Zionist entity in international platforms especially
      in the Security Council in view of its legally binding resolutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- Foiling any
      international efforts or initiatives that do not win approval of the
      Zionist entity as evident in aborting the proposal of deploying
      international observers despite its shortfalls.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- Continuing declared
      political, informational and military support to the Zionist entity
      despite its crimes against the Palestinian people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">7- Lowering the rank of
      employees supervising the crises from secretary of state to his assistant
      William Burns then to his envoy David Satterfield in a way affirming the
      American trend to ignore the region’s crisis while curbing any
      escalation through the CIA to avoid a regional war.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">8- Allowing the European
      Union and the European NATO members to play an assistant political role
      that would complement the American role in the region in a way serving
      American policy and interests of its Zionist ally.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">9- Employing internal
      pressure cards on a number of Arab countries in accordance with American
      political needs.<b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">Arab
      stand towards American policy:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Arab stand towards the
      USA is governed by certain factors most important of which:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- The repercussions of
      the second Gulf War on Arab solidarity and the ensuing American military
      presence in the region and the political, economic and military
      consequences attached to that presence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Priority of bilateral
      interests with the USA since most of the Arab states set their individual
      interests and relations above their Arab national duty especially those
      receiving economic assistance and custom facilities or enjoy direct
      American military protection.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- A number of Arab
      countries are committed to certain roles in line of serving American
      interests in the region especially countries described by America as
      moderate.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Some Arab states fear
      that the USA might stir internal troubles through opening certain files
      concerning internal affairs,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>charges
      of terrorism, slavery and other issues that the Americans could use to
      interfere in the internal affairs of or pressure those states. Hence those
      countries turned into a hostage to such issues and files.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- The impotence of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Arab institutions in the face of the Zionist entity and the USA
      particularly that the Arabs shackled themselves when they decided that
      negotiations is their sole strategy to solve the conflict, add to that
      Arab division and national weakness.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">These factors directly
      affected Arab performance in face of the American policies, allied with
      the Zionist entity, leading to the state of Arab paralysis and
      helplessness in dealing with the American administration. Such a situation
      is reflected in the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Refraining from any
      denunciation of American stands while merely calling on Washington not to
      be biased in favor of the Zionist position.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Asking the USA to
      interfere to end the Zionist aggression on the Palestinian people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Urging the USA to
      shoulder its political and ethical international responsibilities towards
      the Zionist repression of the Palestinian people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Dispatching Arab
      delegations to explain the Arab situation and begging for an American
      intervention to solve the dispute.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- Ruling out any attempt
      or threat against American interests in the region especially the return
      to using the oil weapon since that would harm the Arabs themselves. The
      Arabs argue that they are not capable of taking such a big step (oil
      embargo) because it would threaten their common interests with the USA.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- Some Arab countries and
      leaders continue to assist the American role in the region especially
      through efforts of countries establishing relations with the Zionist
      entity and others. They do not wish for a political vacuum that would lead
      to further escalation in the region. Hence came the numerous Arab
      initiatives to return to the pre 28 September 2000 and a return to the
      negotiating table.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">The
      PA stand towards American policies:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The PA position could not
      be separated from the Arab stand since they are essentially the same with
      a mere relative tactical difference and certain specialty due to the
      PA’s situation and political trends. The most prominent factors
      affecting the PA’s stand are the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- The Oslo team believes
      that 99% of the cards of the political game in the region are in the hands
      of the USA.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- The team fears that an
      American step to strip the PA off its political legitimacy would mean the
      beginning of the end of that team.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- That team also focuses
      on importance of harmonizing with American political and security
      initiatives due to the aforementioned two factors.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Personal considerations
      of a number PA leaders who linked their fate to the USA whether due to
      being employed by its intelligence services or their need for American
      support in face of internal competition on important positions in the PA
      and the PLO after Arafat’s absence. This explains the numerous visits of
      different PA political and security officials to the USA. The USA recently
      leaked information that six PA ministers and 11 legislative council
      members were on the CIA seasonal payroll.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- The PA is determined to
      continue along the Oslo path considering it the only strategic option
      available, which necessitates the intervention of an international party
      to help in finding a political settlement and to serve as the guarantor
      for implementation of any signed agreement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- The PA acknowledges
      American tilt towards the Zionist entity and its sole leadership of the
      world without presence of any other alternate international party.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Such considerations have
      their impact on the PA’s stand towards the USA and its policies in the
      region, examples of such influence:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Continuing positive
      interaction with the USA’s political and security role in the region
      whether due to real desire or in response to political and economic
      pressures.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Continuing to beg for
      an American role and even seeking to involve the American administration
      into the Middle East quagmire in its capacity as the sole party capable of
      pressuring the Zionist government.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Denouncing the American
      stands that support the Zionist entity’s repressive policies and the
      American unlimited support to occupation with all means while retaining
      open bridges with the American administration. The PA tries to voice
      protests to satisfy the Palestinian street while at the same time its
      maintains its relationship with the US.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">4- Trying to encourage international parties such
      as Russia, the European union and finally China to play a role in the
      peace process to break the American monopoly on the Middle East file. It
      also tried using that method to pressure the USA into returning to play an
      effective role in the settlement fearing to lose its weight in the region
      especially in the light of the recent lapses of American foreign policy in
      international platforms.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- Urging certain Arab
      countries to mediate with the American administration to activate its role
      or to explain the PA’s stand or to table the PA’s ideas with the
      Americans in the form of initiatives to extricate the PA, parties to the
      peace process and America’s allies in the region from the current
      ordeal.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font color="#0000FF">The
      losing bet:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The American president’s
      statements that declared absolute support to the Zionist entity and asked
      the PA to exert 100% efforts to halt resistance along with the vice
      president Dick Cheney’s support of Zionist assassination policy wiped
      out all speculations that Bush was less influenced by Zionist lobby that
      supported his presidential opponent Al Gore. This proves that betting on a
      neutral American role was unrealistic and illogical and that dragging the
      USA into the region was not and will not be in favor of the Palestinians
      and the Arabs. This was proven in Clinton’s era and later Bush. The
      matter thus is not linked to an administration, party or the person ruling
      the USA in as much as other factors most important of which:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- The importance of the
      USA’s vital and strategic interests in the region topped by security and
      existence of the Zionist entity since the Zionist project was the
      brainchild of the colonialist West. This project would have never seen the
      light had it not been for absolute western support. The USA had taken over
      leadership of the West after World War II. One of its most important
      responsibilities was preserving the existence and security of the Zionist
      entity in Palestine in its capacity as the West’s advanced military and
      culture base.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- The American law and
      election rules give the various pressure groups a considerable political
      influence. Top of those groups comes the Zionist lobby that gains strength
      from two main elements:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The first its financial
      resources in the money market (Wall Street) and other giant companies in
      arms industry, technology and banks in addition to huge informational
      resources in the media making, audio-visual production and the cinema.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The second its presence in
      the White House and various political decision-making apparatuses, which
      can be clearly witnessed in decisions on the Middle East.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- The American political
      system, in theory, is based on balanced pluralism where lobbies
      representing various interests are the instrument used to insure the
      political leadership is representative of their collective views. The
      balance of interests of various parties composing the society leads to
      balance of policies. However, strength of the Zionist lobby turned the
      American political system into an unbalanced system in view of its
      supremacy over other pressure groups. Thus we find the American Congress
      in the past few months adopting several decisions and draft laws affirming
      unlimited support to the Zionist entity and others condemning the PA on
      unanimous basis with the exception of only one deputy. This raises the
      question on absence of an Arab pressure group in the USA.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- The absolute American
      support to the Zionist entity is not limited to certain sectors but rather
      it is a popular trend as affirmed in opinion polls that showed an 85%
      support to the Zionist entity. Furthermore, more than 70% supported the
      Zionist policy of assassination, which is an indication that the
      American-Zionist alliance was supported by the American society. Backing
      Israel is a popular, cultural, religious, American and western phenomenon
      linked to a belief in the return of the Messiah that is deeply rooted in
      the western culture based on their belief in the Old Testament. Church in
      the USA has a big influence on the society and the American political
      figures despite the talk of segregating religion from the state.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The aforementioned, other
      than numerous phenomena that could not all be listed here, affirm that
      betting on the American role in the region was the helpless choice of a
      party that linked itself, program and future to enemies of its people and
      Nation and is thus trekking an absurd road that would not lead to anything
      tangible or worthwhile.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Any effective and
      practical dealing with the USA must be based on the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Giving less weight to
      the USA role in the region and trying to contain and isolate it, which
      requires disregarding its initiatives and not begging for its solutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Making it clear to USA
      that its interests in the region and the world would not be served in the
      light of its unconditional support of the Zionist entity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Maintaining open
      channels with the American public to inform them of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>what is truly taking place in Palestine and to explain the dangers
      that the Zionist project poses to American stability and her interests in
      the long run through activating the role of Arab societies and
      coordinating their efforts.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Endorsing the
      resistance program as the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic
      Nation’s strategic option along with developing elements of power in the
      Nation and giving up once and for all the political settlement option,
      which represents the main weak point through which the USA and the
      Zionists penetrate our people and Nation’s ranks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- Reviving the committees
      formed to boycott American goods and presenting national alternatives.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>In short:</b> logical,
      practical and realistic stands necessitate dealing with the American
      administration as the patron and participant in the Zionist project in the
      region and thus all policies and work programs should be based on that
      assumption while having deep understanding of the political, social and
      doctrinal situation in the USA along with an understanding of America’s
      interests and policies in the region and the world.</p>
