      escalates in confrontation of Sharon government’s terrorism</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Zionist premier Ariel
      Sharon did not need 100 days to complete execution of his plan, main
      points of which were declared on his victory of the election. The past two
      months were enough to display his plan in practice without succeeding in
      actualizing his promise to the Zionist audience that is thirsty for
      security and without implementing his expectations that the intifada would
      end in the first weeks of his ascension to power.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The martyrdom operations
      and mortar shells were the early Palestinian methods in confronting Sharon
      and his criminal government. Still there is more creative resistance
      operations that would continue alongside popular confrontations until
      defeat of occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Sharon’s
      terrorism did not succeed in defeating resistance</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon started his
      campaign against the Palestinian people with tightening the siege laid to
      cities, towns and villages. He also refused to transfer collected custom
      dues to the Palestinian Authority in a bid to force it return to security
      coordination. He demanded the PA to re-detain leaders of Jihad and Islamic
      Resistance who were released at start of the Aqsa intifada. However, the
      campaign failed in the light of escalation of resistance offensives
      especially the martyrdom operations that coincided with the Arab summit in
      Amman. Sharon later shifted to leveling painful blows to Palestinian
      security centers especially the Force-17, which he accused of facilitating
      the resistance attacks and even taking part in some of them. The attempts,
      which aimed at terrorizing the PA, did not bear fruit so far in the
      required form due to absence of any progress on the political level along
      with Sharon’s rejection of holding<span style="color:navy"> </span>negotiations
      with the PA as long as resistance continued. The Zionist savage shelling
      was coupled with field liquidation of resistance and intifada activists
      especially those of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, four of whom were so far
      martyred in Zionist operations. This campaign also failed due to
      continuation of daily resistance operations particularly the escalation in
      firing mortar shells at Zionist settlements in Gaza. The Zionists
      considered such shelling as a serious threat to their security and
      expressed fears of resultant big losses in lines of the settlers. They
      claimed that the attacks inflicted three casualties so far.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When Sharon realized that
      his iron-fist policy did not succeed in breaking the Palestinian
      people’s determination, he moved in two adjacent methods:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">First: carrying out
      terrorist storming operations of certain cities and suburbs under control
      of the PA especially in the Gaza Strip and Al-Khalil (Hebron) in view of
      the presence of Jewish settlement areas within them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Second: intensifying
      security contacts with the PA to reap the fruit of the military pressures
      and push the Authority into returning to security coordination after
      luring it with resumption of negotiations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon coupled such a
      policy with voicing statements accepting establishment of a disarmed
      Palestinian state on 42% of the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On the other hand, he
      entrusted his partner (Peres) with launching a diplomatic campaign to
      picture the Palestinian people’s struggle as violence and terrorism in
      addition to justifying Zionist repressive measures in their capacity as
      retaliation to such terrorism and an attempt to protect the Zionists.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Despite continuation of
      the Zionist security campaign, yet the Palestinian people’s insistence
      on continuance of intifada and resistance led to failure of Sharon’s
      goal of subduing the Palestinian people into accepting nothing more than
      his predecessor Barak had offered.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Meanwhile, the PA’s
      secret and public negotiations with Sharon’s government was met with
      strong opposition in the Palestinian street that expressed its rejection
      of such practice through marches and demonstrations in addition to
      continuation of confrontations with the occupation. This opposition pushed
      the PA to be very cautious in dealing with such negotiations particularly
      when the maximum limit offered by Sharon was less than that tabled by
      Barak that was rejected on the Palestinian, Arab and Islamic levels.
      Furthermore, hopes that the new American administration of Bush would
      pressure the Zionists into resuming negotiations from the point, which
      they had reached, died out. This administration was totally biased in
      favor of the Zionists as was evident in condemning Palestinian resistance
      operations and giving the green light for Sharon’s campaign against
      intifada and resistance activists during Sharon’s visit to the USA
      earlier this month. However, fears of the PA’s submission to Sharon and
      his security demand were still there. Information indicated that the
      meeting held in Gaza between PA chairman Yasser Arafat and Avy Dachter,
      head of the Zionist general security apparatus (The Shabak) to discuss the
      most dangerous issue that annoyed the Zionists lately, i.e. the firing of
      mortar shells that slammed into Zionist positions and settlements within
      and at the outskirts of the Gaza Strip, had led Arafat to acquiesce. He
      agreed to work for halting the mortar attacks in response to Zionist
      threats that the Zionist occupation army would directly target his
      Authority if he did not adopt practical measures to stop those assaults.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b><font color="#0000FF">PA
      and the hesitation between both options: steadfastness or submission</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Sharon continued in his campaign against the
      Palestinian people and concentrated on striking Palestinian security
      forces in addition to destroying Palestinian houses and buildings, which
      he claimed were used by the Palestinian resistance. Zionist hesitation
      over the best method of dealing with the PA was apparent. The Zionists
      were hesitant whether to preserve and avoid the collapse of the PA or to
      prevent it from coordinating with the Palestinian people in resisting
      occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sharon conveyed a message
      to Arafat namely that he did not intend to reoccupy PA areas. Sharon’s
      son Omray, who secretly met with Arafat in Ramallah, carried the message.
      On the other hand, he launched a practical step by occupying a number of
      areas categorized as (A) zones for limited hours during which his soldiers
      destroyed Palestinian targets and buildings. The operation indicated that
      Sharon similar to his predecessor Barak was not interested so far in
      ending that Authority so as to avoid confronting more difficult and
      stronger foes. However, Sharon was interested in pushing that Authority
      into the brink of collapse to compel it to accept a formula for security
      coordination and achieve political gains. No doubt Sharon and his security
      machine were primarily targeting Arafat in person who they believe is the
      key to relations with the Zionist entity ignoring the fact that Arafat and
      the PA could not bypass the Palestinian people’s will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Even if they managed to bypass the Palestinians’ will at a
      certain previous stage, yet it was not possible this time after all those
      sacrifices and blood offered by the Palestinian people. The PA feared that
      it would be charged with treachery if it sought to terminate the intifada
      in return for gains that would not convince a small Palestinian child.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The PA was trying to cope
      with the popular leanings, including its organization the Fatah Movement,
      while at the same time trying to preserve its presence and gains secured
      through winning satisfaction of the Zionists. The PA’s options was
      moving in between as long as it saw that its presence was not threatened
      and as long as it continued to believe that it could secure more gains
      through negotiations, a matter surely not accepted by the Palestinian
      people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">Growing and
      continuing intifada despite pains and wounds</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The intifada, after six
      months of its eruption, secured numerous gains whether on the level of
      asserting the Palestinian people’s insistence on their rights, lands and
      holy shrines or whether through asserting the option of steadfastness and
      resistance. It further succeeded in activating popular support on the Arab
      and Islamic levels in addition to restoring conflict with the Zionist
      enemy to its early and real beginnings that is based on contradiction of
      the Zionist project with the project of the Nation’s renaissance and
      progress.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Though the Aqsa intifada
      did not lead to big changes in the official Arab stand as represented in
      the Amman summit late last month, a number of relatively positive
      developments took place on that level namely supporting the resistance
      program and granting it Arab legitimacy after it was rejected or at least
      not supported in the past.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We may quote a German
      expert as saying in an article published in his country on 6 April that
      the “second intifada displayed pointers on the possibility that (Israel)
      might lose the image of an invincible state and even (accept the idea)
      that it could be defeated in the end.” We also would like to refer to
      the Zionist statistics on intifada activities, which are naturally less
      than the real figures, stipulating that the intifada led to the killing of
      75 Zionists and more than 550 wounded in six months compared to less than
      400 Zionist wounded during six years of the first intifada, which started
      in 1987. It is a sure thing that the Zionist human losses were increasing
      in addition to economic losses. The most important loss, however, was the
      psychological factor, which directly affected the Zionist society’s
      ability of steadfastness. Continuation of Zionist losses in the next few
      years would lead to changes in the Zionist position that could accept
      giving up occupied areas similar to its withdrawal from South Lebanon
      following concentrated resistance strikes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As for the Palestinian
      losses, they are expected and known but the Palestinian people backed with
      their Arab and Islamic Nation have always proven that they were capable of
      steadfastness and withstanding repercussions of resistance for the sake of
      achieving their noble goal of ejecting occupation. Surely this people’s
      ability to resist will continue and increase despite Sharon’s arrogance
      and<span style="mso-spacerun:
