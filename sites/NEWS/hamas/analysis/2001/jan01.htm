      proposals … American-Zionist conspiracy doomed to failure<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">American
      president Bill Clinton did not wish to leave the presidency on 20 January
      before achieving a final accomplishment that would be registered in the
      black Zionist lobby’s files and without trying to save the stringent
      General Ehud Barak from falling in the forthcoming Zionist elections in
      the light of the continued progress of his more extremist and terrorist
      opponent Ariel Sharon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Hence,
      came the proposals declared by the outgoing American president as a last
      ditch effort to endorse results and understandings reached in the Camp
      David II negotiations and compelling the Palestinian Authority to accept
      tabled solutions to the questions of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and refugees,
      which were not completely finalized during those negotiations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      unusual intensity of negotiations in the past few weeks over Clinton’s
      proposals harbingers new Palestinian concessions and threatens to abort
      the intifada that broke out of rejection of similar proposals in the first
      place.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Clinton’s
      proposals … background and motives</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">It
      was obvious long time ago that the Palestinian Authority wished to invest
      the intifada to achieve political gains but it was unable to do so at its
      early beginnings out of fear from popular Palestinian and Arab reactions.
      Furthermore, the PA estimated that the Barak government was not interested
      in reinvigorating the settlement process or improving its offers tabled in
      Camp David II negotiations. Two months after outbreak of the intifada and
      the accompanying decline in Barak’s popularity, he tabled his
      resignation from the premiership thus starting the race for the post,
      pointers of which indicate that the Zionist street was inclined to vote
      for the Likud candidate Ariel Sharon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Faced
      with such a situation, Barak reached the conclusion that his only chance
      to defeat Sharon was concluding a final settlement with the PA after
      exploiting the American president Bill Clinton’s wish to accomplish an
      historic agreement before leaving the presidency. Thus Barak expedited his
      advisors and representatives to hold secret meetings with PA leaders to
      probe the Authority’s willingness to seize that opportunity as well. The
      meetings reaffirmed the PA’s wish to extend a helping hand to Barak
      after considering that the other alternative would be much worse than him,
      that he would drag the region into an atmosphere of war, that he would
      escalate repressive measures against the intifada and against the PA
      itself, which was starting to fear its status in the midst of such a
      terrified scenario.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">When
      the in-camera talks succeeded in luring the PA into winning relatively
      better gains than those achieved in Camp David II especially regarding the
      area of land to be transferred to Palestinian sovereignty (around 95% of
      the West Bank in addition to the whole of Gaza Strip), the American
      administration announced its readiness to receive Palestinian and Zionist
      delegations to table its proposals on a lasting settlement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      American proposals were based on the Zionist position tabled during
      marathon talks that were secretly and openly held in and outside
      Palestinian lands during the past month of December. Yet the
      American-Zionist wish to forge a speedy agreement with PA endorsement made
      Clinton officially table his proposals asking the Palestinian party in
      particular to accept them as they are without any amendments in their
      capacity as the gist of the Zionist stance and the best possible offer.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">It
      was not strange that Barak would announce his principled acceptance of the
      proposals only few days after tabling them in Washington with Zionist and
      Palestinian delegations since they were originally Zionist ideas with
      minor amendments. However, the PA could not accept them because it needed
      more time to prepare and convince the public opinion not to display strong
      opposition to the negotiations based on those proposals since they do not
      guarantee return of refugees and do not allow real Palestinian sovereignty
      over Al-Quds!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">However,
      Arafat’s visit to America including his meeting with Clinton was an
      attempt to throw the ball (of such burning proposals) into the Zionist
      court out of the wish not to shoulder the responsibility of rejecting
      them. He tabled a number of queries to the American administration as a
      hurdle in face of PA acceptance of them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      PA paid a heavy price for dealing with those proposals namely accepting
      the resumption of security coordination and seeking to calm down the
      intifada in addition to showing readiness to accept them if certain
      Palestinian reservations were taken into consideration.</p>
      <h1 style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Clinton’s
      Zionist proposals and the Palestinian reservations</font></b></h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Despite
      the fact that Clinton’s proposals were not tabled as an official
      memorandum so far but rather verbal points tabled by Clinton in the
      presence of the Zionist and Palestinian delegations in Washington, yet
      their details were leaked to Zionist and Palestinian media means then
      Clinton divulgee them in a speech at the Israeli political forum on 8
      January.</p>

      following table reveals nature of the American proposals and both the
      Zionist and Palestinian explanations of them:</p>

      proposals on the scale</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">It
      is clear that the proposals took into consideration most of the Zionist
      demands especially those dealing with the issues of Al-Quds and the
      refugees. Hence came the Barak government’s approval of those proposals
      with some reservations. Furthermore, Barak was hoping to conclude a
      framework peace agreement that would help him in the elections scheduled
      for 6 February. However, the PA found itself in between American pressures
      to accept the proposals as is without any clarifications and the rejection
      of the Palestinian people with all its forces including the Fatah
      Movement, the backbone of the Authority.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">In
      the light of the continuation of the blessed intifada against occupation,
      any initiation of political talks with the enemy would mean letting down
      the intifada and weakening the resistance option. The price wanted in
      those talks was the head of the intifada because the Zionist enemy would
      not sign any agreement as long as the intifada was still raging. The
      Zionists also demanded the PA’s return to full security coordination
      with the occupation authorities including exerting all possible efforts to
      halt what they call “violence” and “terrorism” i.e. the intifada
      and the armed resistance operations!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">When
      it comes to core of the negotiations, what is tabled does not exceed the
      Camp David II proposals with the exception of certain improvements as far
      as Al-Quds is concerned. The proposals, however, retained Zionist
      sovereignty over the whole city of Al-Quds through converting it into an
      open city along with sovereignty on the old city and hegemony on passages
      and crossings and the real control on the Haram Al-Sharif. The most
      important accomplishment for the enemy would be winning the largest Quds
      known in history.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">As
      for the issue of the refugees, the right of return was not accepted. The
      agreement attempts to reduce it to the minimum of allowing their return to
      PA controlled areas, compensations or resettlement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">There
      is no change towards the issue of the Palestinian state that would be
      enjoying limited sovereignty, disarmed and linked to Zionist security
      through the early warning stations, arms caches and Zionist military
      presence in the Jordan Valley. The enemy troops would be also present
      through participation in the international forces on the borders and
      border crossings. Furthermore, the Palestinian lands would be divided into
      three Cantons isolated from each other (the north and center Canton, the
      southern Canton and the Gaza Canton).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">No
      doubt, taking six years to complete the withdrawals would return the same
      experience of the Oslo agreements as a result of the expected Zionist
      delays under various pretexts. Application of the accord would be
      dependent on the nature of the occupation government, its alliances,
      internal conditions, nature of its relations with the PA, persistence of
      the intifada and presence of resistance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      agreement does not achieve the minimum of Palestinian ambitions and will
      attempt to abort the intifada prior to reaching its aspired goal of
      defeating occupation in all Palestinian territories. Furthermore, its
      details and application mechanics would convert it into another transitory
      agreement but this time for final status issues. In turn, that agreement
      would also need detailed accords, application of which would be subject to
      wishes of the stronger party in the equation namely the Zionist entity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Surely,
      the PA realizes reality of such proposals and the serious repercussions of
      accepting them on present and future of the Palestine cause. However, this
      did not prevent the PA from accepting the proposals even if it tried to
      delay its clear response due to certain calculations pertaining to the
      Palestinian street’s rejection of them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      PA tried to attain an Arab authorization to go ahead with the negotiations
      on the basis of Clinton’s proposals through tabling them at the recent
      meetings of the Arab follow-up committee, which emanated from the Arab
      League, in Cairo. However, the meeting did not give a green light to the
      Authority and insisted on the broad lines of Arab and Palestinian demands
      without passing a definite opinion accepting or refusing the proposals.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      Egyptian stand was the only one supporting a positive reaction to
      Clinton’s proposals while Syria and Saudi Arabia were still expressing
      reservations, asking the PA not to expedite an approval.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      marathon talks currently taking place on all political and security levels
      between the PA and the Barak government in addition to the concomitant
      announcement of resuming security coordination reflected a PA’s
      practical approval of Clinton’s proposals even if that stand was not
      officially declared. The current talks reflect an attempt to bargain and
      improve certain articles within those proposals for the sake of accepting
      them in future if appropriate internal circumstances were permissible
      (stoppage or retreat of the intifada) along with external conditions
      (improving the American stand with the advent of the new administration of
      president George Bush).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Despite
      the fact that no agreement was possible before end of Clinton’s term in
      office, the negotiations persisted with the aim of reaching an agreement
      before the upcoming Zionist elections to help Barak beat his opponent
      Sharon in the event of which the road would be open to implement that
      agreement. If an agreement were not reached, writing down points of
      concord would help both sides resume negotiations from the point that they
      had reached. Sharon, if he wins the election, will be forced to positively
      react to those understandings instead of starting new negotiations,
      results of which would not be favorable to the PA as the present ones.</p>
      <h1 style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The
      Palestinian people have decided and the intifada will persist</font></b></h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">We
      have to point out that the Palestinian and Arab streets were against those
      negotiations and that the PA was standing alone and isolated in its
      decision that let down and weakened the intifada and resistance. Those
      decisions even pose as a conspiracy to abort and end the intifada and deal
      a blow to the Palestinian people’s national aspirations and goals.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Therefore,
      we greatly doubt the PA’s ability to market any political agreement with
      the enemy at a time when the intifada and resistance are continuing and at
      a time when all forms of Zionist aggression on the Palestinian people are
      still persisting. Furthermore, Barak could not present more than those
      offered in the Clinton proposals because the price would be weakening his
      stand in the upcoming elections. Hence, the chances of reaching an
      agreement between the two parties prior to the Zionist elections are slim
      and the issue will need</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">&nbsp;a
      few more months before the negotiations resume after Bush assumes
      presidency and after the Zionist elections. The Palestinian people will
      remain resisting occupation and its repressive measures in addition to
      rejecting any bargaining over national rights and lands.</p>
