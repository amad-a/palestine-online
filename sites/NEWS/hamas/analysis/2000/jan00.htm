mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The U.S. President’s
      announcement following the meeting between his Secretary of State and
      President Hafez Assad of Syria regarding the resumption of the
      Syrian-Israeli talks from the point they stopped at in 1996 was surprising
      after a media clash between the Syrians and the Israelis over the
      so-called “Rabin trust”. This “trust” was said to be given by the
      former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin to the U.S. Administration in which
      the former pledged to withdraw from the whole of the Syrian Golan Heights
      which the Israelis have been occupying since 1967.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The interpretation of the
      term “resuming talks from the point they had stopped at” had also
      threatened to abort attempts to take advantage of the atmosphere caused by
      the coming of Barak to power, which was welcomed by the Syrian President
      who commended Barak’s person.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The U.S. Administration
      seems to have succeeded in solving this dispute by leaving that phrase
      vague in order to enable both parties to interpret it in the way it suits
      them. Although the reason behind the resumption of the talks has not been
      announced as yet, Israeli Prime Minister Barak was keen to assert that he
      did not give any relinquishment to resume them. He also avoided any
      comment on his position towards the retreat of his troops to the borders
      of 4 June 1967.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Syria, however, kept
      silent about the pledges it received from the Israelis in order to return
      to the table of negotiations. But it is likely that Barak gave the U.S.
      Administration a verbal undertaking to withdraw from the whole of the
      Golan Heights with slight alterations at the borders.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The resumption of the
      negotiations reflects an Israeli, Syrian and American desire to make
      progress towards the achievement of a peace treaty. Barak’s government
      is keen to implement a promise it introduced to the new Knesset to
      withdraw from Lebanon by July 2000. This cannot happen without a peace
      treaty with Lebanon, which rejects this unless a similar peace treaty is
      reached between Israel and Syria, or unless Israel implements a unilateral
      withdrawal from Lebanon, an option that is very dangerous for the security
      of the Jewish State. Moreover, achieving a peace settlement on the Syrian
      and Lebanese tracks is considered less complicated for Israel than
      achieving a permanent settlement with the Palestinian Authority, which
      will have its position in negotiations weakened against the enhancement of
      Israel’s position because it will appear as a party that is eager for
      peace. Therefore, Israel’s political position will be strong at the
      international level. This will also oblige the United States and Europe to
      exert pressure on the Palestinian party to eventually accept Israel’s
      vision regarding the issues of the final talks. It will be hard for the PA
      to accept this vision because it fosters the occupation and the Jewish
      settlements and ignores the most important issues, especially that of the
      status of Jerusalem and the refugees.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">As for Syria, it insisted
      on its position, which rejects the resumption of talks unless they start
      from the point at which they stopped three years ago. Several Israeli
      press sources pointed out that Barak pledged to withdraw Israeli troops to
      the borders of 4 June 1967 with some changes on the borders. Therefore,
      Syria’s acceptance to resume talks with Israel can be seen as an
      abandonment of its previous demand to get an Israeli pledge to withdraw
      from the whole of the Golan Heights. This could be considered a Syrian
      desire to reduce the American pressure on it during this stage and to give
      the U.S. Administration an important card to achieve a significant
      political achievement at a time when the Syrian leadership is in bad need
      of American support to pave the road for Bashar Al-Assad to succeed his
      father. This will enable the new Syrian leader, Bashar Al-Assad, to run
      the country smoothly after ending the dispute with the Jewish State.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Regardless of the result
      of these negotiations in future, their being resumed after a long period
      of stalemate is considered a breakthrough. The Israeli sources stress that
      secret talks preceded the announcement of the resumption of the
      Syrian-Israeli negotiations. This announcement had also come after a long
      series of European and other mediations, as well as the efforts exerted by
      the U.S. Administration, which alone bore fruit.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The statements made by
      Farouk Shara, Syrian Foreign Minister, show that there is a possibility to
      reach a peace treaty with Israel in a few months because 80% of the issues
      on the agenda of negotiations have already been agreed upon. He also said
      there was a real Syrian desire to reach a peace settlement with Israel
      regardless of the progress attained on the Palestinian track.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>

      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The resumption of talks at
      a high level (Shara-Barak) enhances the belief that the parties are
      serious about making rapid achievements in the negotiations. This fact
      encouraged U.S. President Clinton to say that the year 2000 will be the
      year of peace, keeping in mind a possible breakthrough on the
      Palestinian-Israeli talks as well.<o:p>

      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Syrian
      Foreign Minister had asserted in the press conference he held in
      Washington with the Israeli Prime Minister and the U.S. President
      following the first round of the resumed talks that Syria will have a
      right to restore its occupied lands by force if the peace talks failed, he
      stressed on building peace relations and accepted the normalization of
      ties with the Jewish State. He did not mention Syria’s demand to have a
      complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the borders of the 4
      June 1967. He also did not link signing a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty with
      an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.
      All these are indications that Syria does want to achieve a real agreement
      with the Jewish State without previous conditions that could spoil the
      negotiations.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the importance of
      the breakthrough made by the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli
      negotiations, there are still a host of suspended issues that should be
      resolved although they will take much time before being solved, especially
      that the Syrian negotiators are known to be firm in facing the Israeli
      hard-line negotiators. Syria also owns an important card to restoring its
      rights, that being the continuation of the resistance in South Lebanon,
      which annoys the Israelis and forces them to withdraw their troops from
      the Golan and South Lebanon.<o:p>

      </span>Withdrawal: Syria demands a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
      Heights to the borders of 4 June 1967 and based on United Nations
      resolution 242. There are no indications that Israel will accept this
      demand because Barak’s government and the former Israeli governments
      insist on the withdrawal to the international borders set in 1923 between
      Palestine and Syria, which made the Syrian “Himmeh” area fall within
      the borders of Palestine. This area was taken back by Syria after 1949 but
      was occupied by Israel in 1967. Israel accepts to give the Himmeh area
      back to the Syrians but insists to retain control over the whole of
      Tiberias. Israel also demands to retain control over water resources while
      Syria wants to share them with Israel.<o:p>

      </span>Security: This is the most sensitive issue for the Israelis who put

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Building an early warning
      station on Al-Sheikh Mountain in the Golan Heights. This demand was
      approved by the Syrians during Rabin’s tenure provided that it is under
      American supervision. It is not known whether the Syrians agreed on the
      existence of Israeli security elements under U.S. supervision in that

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Mutuality on the security
      measures. Syria insisted on mutuality against the various Israeli demands
      in this respect. But Syria agreed to disarm an area of 10 kilometres
      beyond the Golan borders while an area of 6 kilometres depth in Israel
      from the Golan borders will be disarmed.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">There are Israeli demands
      to reduce the number of Syrian soldiers and to lower the level of arming

      </span>Peace and normalization: This includes opening embassies, the
      exchange of diplomatic missions, the normalization of ties, and allowing
      citizens of each country to enter the other country. Syria had agreed on
      these measures in 1996, but based on the notion that the normalization of
      ties must be a decision made by the people themselves and cannot be
      achieved by an administrative decision by the government. This means that
      the Syrian-Israeli relations will be normal peace relations, not like what
      is going between Jordan and Israel. In addition, Syria insists that the
      normalization should start with the end of the last phase of Israeli
      withdrawal from the Golan Heights.<o:p>

      </span>Timing: This includes the time required to achieve the peace treaty
      and the complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights. There are still some
      disputes between Syria and Israel concerning the time period of the
      withdrawal. Syria demands that this period should not exceed one year
      while Israel is talking about a period of 4-6 years.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to these
      issues, there is the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, which should
      be negotiated by Israel and Lebanon side by side with the Syrian-Israeli
      negotiations over the Golan Heights. It seems that Israel will agree to
      give Syria a free hand in Lebanon after signing the peace agreement with
      it in order to appease Syria and to make sure of Lebanon’s obligation of
      preventing Hizbullah from carrying out military attacks against the Jewish
      State. Syria, which has distinctive relations with Hizbullah, can convince
      it to stop its military attacks against Israel after the restoration of
      all occupied territories in South Lebanon.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Israel demands
      compensation from the United States for the withdrawal from the Golan
      Heights. This compensation amounts to $18 billion for about 17,000 Jewish
      settlers living in the Golan who will be forced to leave their settlements
      after signing an agreement with Syria. This amount also includes the costs
      of the withdrawal and the operating of the early warning system. Although
      the U.S. Administration did not reject the principle of giving
      compensation, it adjourned discussing it later because it knows that it
      will be involved in a fierce battle with Congress, which is dominated by a
      majority of Republicans who strongly reject paying compensations for
      parties involved in the peace settlements. Congress had rejected such
      compensations for the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Israel for one
      year before releasing a sum of $2 billion, which President Clinton
      promised to pay for these parties after signing the Wye River Memorandum
      in October 1998.&nbsp;<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, there is
      Barak’s pledge to make a public referendum on any agreement reached with
      Syria after being approved by the Knesset. This could hinder the
      implementation of the expected agreement because the public opinion polls
      showed that the Israelis tend to reject the withdrawal from the Golan
      Heights although it is a slight majority, according to a recent poll
      conducted by Yediot Ahoronot (10 December 1999) in which 54% of the
      Israelis said they reject a withdrawal against a comprehensive peace that
      includes withdrawal from Lebanon and security arrangements; 45% of the
      Israelis supported the withdrawal under these arrangements.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Israeli sources believe
      that opposing the withdrawal could be weakened if the Israeli government
      succeeds in reaching peace agreements with Syria, Lebanon and the PA at
      the same time, which will end the status of war between Israel and the
      Arab countries. This will increase the chances of convincing the Israeli
      Street to approve these agreements if Barak succeeds in avoiding
      opposition of the withdrawal from the religious and right parties inside
      his coalition government.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Accordingly, the
      possibility of making progress in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations is now
      clearer and closer than at any time before. But there are still several
      obstacles, such as the security arrangements and laying down the borders.
      These issues include details which are still not agreed upon and will be
      at the centre of the coming negotiations, especially since all the
      outlines of the peace settlement between Syria and Israel were agreed upon
      in 1996.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">But the progress on the
      Syrian track will have a negative impact on the Palestinian track; the
      Palestinian Authority believes that Israel could suspend the
      implementation of the rest of the transitional agreements between Israel
      and the PA and could make the final status talks go slower than before as
      a result.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Feeling its weak position
      in negotiations with Israel, the PA may rush to give more relinquishments
      to the Israelis. Therefore, Israel would achieve important gains in the
      peace talks with the Arab parties, which will have disastrous
      consequences, especially at the Palestinian level, regarding the issues of
      Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the refugees.</font><o:p>
