      for the parties involved in the peace process after it suddenly entered a
      serious deadlock. For various reasons, the “tracks” game Barak played
      did not accord him the expected pay-off. And as a result, the negotiations
      on both the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks came to a halt almost
      simultaneously. <o:p>

      temporary issue owing to the poor manner in which Barak handled the
      negotiation process. But there are others who would go as far as to say
      that the present Israeli regime is not very different from its predecessor
      and that the current peace negotiations may face problems similar to those
      which were faced by that of the Netanyahu regime as well as some new

      connected with the negotiations reveals that this deadlock was not without
      a preface. Having declared his political manifesto theoretically, it was
      just a matter of time before Barak’s real agenda surfaced. It is now
      evident that Barak’s strongly worded election manifesto represented his

      by the Israeli Ministry of Housing and published in the Israeli newspapers
      on 21 February 2000, approximately 7,120 housing units have been
      constructed in the West Bank occupied territories since the beginning of
      Barak’s reign in 1999, as compared with 5,400 housing units during
      Netanyahu’s reign in 1998. Also, the Minister for Housing, Yitzhak Levy,
      has endorsed a package to construct 3,196 housing units, including 2,500
      to be built in Jerusalem, saying that the strategic plan of his ministry
      stipulates building 50,000 housing units in the Jewish State and the West
      Bank’s occupied territories. This plan confirms that Barak, under the
      pretext of peace, is trying to fulfil what Netanyahu’s hard-line
      government was unable to accomplish.<o:p>

      Peace Now movement indicate an enormous rise in the number of settler Jews

      the suspension of new settlement projects, estimated by some Israeli
      sources to be around 1,000, these very sources revealed that the Israeli
      government had ordered the building of 1,100 housing units and that this
      was approved before the order for the freeze was issued. In fact, the
      order for the freeze covers only a small portion of the settlement
      projects. With regard to the Abu Ghneim and Ra’s al-Amoud settlement
      projects, work has continued unabated with the tacit approval of the Barak
      government.<o:p>

14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">In sharp contrast to this fierce settlement
      activity, the peace process has made very little progress; redeployment of
      Israeli forces was made on only 12% of the West Bank area, and only 2% of
      this was handed over to the Palestinian self-rule Authority’s security
      and political control. As for the third phase of the redeployment, which
      is the most important phase as it provides for handing over 6.1% of
      territory (B) to (A) in accordance with the Sharm el-Sheikh interim
      agreement, this has yet to be implemented. Among other things, Israel
      released a number of criminals, including those who had completed their
      terms; opened the so-called “safe passage” of the south; gave the
      occupation forces the power to intercept or arrest any suspect; and
      imposed the use of “traffic passes” for using the safe-passage road,
      virtually making all decisions concerning its use unilaterally, except
      those issues concerning location and details of future safe passages which
      have been adjourned (by the Israelis) till negotiations that are yet to be
      held. For these reasons, Yasser Arafat described the negotiations as a
      waste of time. Other Palestinian officials are saying that Barak wants to
      sustain the peace negotiations merely to give the impression that the
      negotiations on the Palestinian track are progressing whereas in fact they
      are frozen.<o:p>

14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Comments by Israeli press and analysts are
      confirming our saying that Barak was hesitant and reluctant in actual
      peace moves. One Uri Avneri said, “To judge Barak’s performance in
      just eight months would be premature since he still has four years at his
      disposal and could work wonders. This is possible, but the eight months
      are enough to judge his efficiency. All the cheques signed by him on the
      eve of his assuming power have bounced. On the Palestinian track, no
      single millimetre of progress was made. Barak’s tactics range from
      ignoring facts completely to desperate attempts to impose things. Thus,
      all deadlines have come to pass, and the only achievement made was the
      opening of one of the safe passages after a delay of five years. And this
      meant nothing at all to the people. The settlement activity and land
      confiscation are witnessing a growing trend—more than what Netanyahu did
      (<i>Ma’ariv,</i> 22 February 2000).”<o:p>

14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Another individual, Amona Alon, said,
      “Most of those who hated Netanyahu can not recall today why they should
      prefer Barak to him. Right from the time he was elected to power,
      Barak’s desperate moves have exceeded those of his predecessor, just
      like air bubbles in a day care centre. If those who hated Netanyahu
      maintained the belief that there was a difference between Netanyahu and
      Barak, that belief has now eroded. Barak is following the footsteps of his
      predecessor and is doing an even better job. The striking evidence to this
      is the news issued yesterday about resumption of the building of roads in
      the West Bank (<i>Yediot Ahranot,</i> 23 February 2000).”<o:p>

      Qara confirms the rightist leanings of Barak’s government saying,
      “Barak’s rise to power has placed the fate of Jabal Abu Ghneim in fine
      darkness. Bulldozers and caterpillars have replaced the abusive rhetoric
      of Netanyahu. By now, five construction companies have already obtained
      permits to begin building. And considering the deteriorated condition of
      the buildings located on Abu Ghneim, coupled with the political clouds of
      the present situation, this project has become a success. Building
      activity is at its peak and sales are flourishing; 1,600 housing units
      have been marketed, out of a total project of 6,500 houses. The
      contractors and property dealers who were very scared prior to the
      elections are now jubilant.<o:p>

      is doubtful whether or not after a few years someone would still remember

      Netanyahu’s government or whether anyone would still remember that it
      was the two regimes of the Labour Party that actually initiated that
      project and practically implemented it before and after Netanyahu (<i>Ha’aritz,</i>

14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Since his election, Barak has given
      preference to the Syrian track and set aside July of 2000 as the deadline
      for pulling out his forces from southern Lebanon owing to the successive
      losses suffered by the Israelis. For this reason, the Israeli government
      preferred to reach mutual agreements with Syria and Lebanon respectively
      that will provide for its withdrawal, although since the beginning it did
      not rule out a unilateral withdrawal. The optimistic atmosphere that was
      prevailing in the region about peace following Barak’s election
      contributed to the resumption of peace talks between Israel, and each of
      Syria and Lebanon. The process, however, soon entered a deadlock as Israel
      vowed to change the agenda of the negotiations—beginning with security
      arrangements and normalization before conceding to a complete pull-out
      from the Golan Heights—a situation that provoked the Syrian President to
      order the cessation of the negotiations after his team returned from the
      U.S. According to Syrian sources, President Assad discovered that the
      Israelis were using delaying tactics and were reluctant to endorse a
      pledge to withdraw from the Golan. And it seems Barak is yet to secure
      from his coalition government the majority needed for a withdrawal from
      the Golan. This became evident after a draft bill was presented by the
      opposition Likud Party (backed by Shas, Mifdal and some other members in
      the coalition government) proposing that there should be more than 50%
      votes in favour of a referendum for the withdrawal from the Golan before
      it could be implemented. And that the voters must be registered voters and
      not only those who participated in the polls. This is an issue that will
      weaken the position of Palestinian voters residing in the territories
      occupied since 1948, who would have automatically voted for the
      withdrawal. Also, the success of this referendum will now depend on its
      acceptance by a two-thirds majority of the total number of voters given
      that the highest turn-out ever registered in Israeli elections is 84% of
      the registered voters.<o:p>

14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Even though Barak did not mean to suspend
      all tracks of negotiations at once, his intransigence caused Syria and
      Palestine to abandon the talks; it is this same intransigence that caused
      the failure of his “tracks” game, though temporarily. In this tracks
      game, Barak concentrated on delaying a settlement on the Palestinian track
      while accelerating it on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Israel has
      increased its attacks on energy stations in Lebanon following a series of
      valiant operations launched by Lebanese Islamic Resistance forces against
      the enemy targets and against that of the Israeli-controlled Southern
      Lebanese Army. The “Nazist” statement that was made by David Levy,
      Israeli Foreign Minister, fuelled flames of wrath among the Arabs against
      the Zionist entity and soured the atmosphere of the peace negotiations to
      which a great deal of hope was attached when it was launched some few
      months ago.<o:p>

      had previously warned the rest of us about drawing inferences as to the
      structure of the government and the statements Barak made when he first
      assumed power in the Zionist entity. It became evident that the hopes
      people pinned on Barak to revamp the peace process and thereafter realize
      a lasting peace settlement, to secure peace treaties with the concerned
      Arab States that would provide for the retrieval of the occupied
      territories of the Arabs and to agree to the sovereign Statehood of

      soon after his victory and who made many promises to push the peace
      process ahead, has differed in approach from his two predecessors: Rabin
      and Peres. Similarly, he differed from Likud leader Benyamin Netanyahu in
      that he does not stress too much on integrating the Jewish State with its
      Arab neighbourhood under peace treaties but rather he strives to please
      the U.S. and to strengthen his strategic alliance with it. He has
      succeeded in this as the U.S. administration has promised to back
      Israel’s political stance at international conferences. But its failure
      to meet the demands of the peace process, in particular the Syrian track
      up to now, has dwindled the hope of the Clinton-led U.S. administration to
      utilize an Israeli-Syrian Peace Treaty to strengthen its position in the
      upcoming U.S. presidential elections scheduled to be held this year. This
      pushes the U.S. administration to make additional efforts to bring the
      Syrian-Israeli negotiations back on track within the few remaining weeks
      in which the Clinton administration can still work before it becomes
      defective owing to engagement in preparation for the next election.<o:p>

      the Sharm el-Sheikh accord (Wye River-2) as all the deadlines that were
      set with Israeli approval for its redeployment have expired. Israel
      continues to maintain that it has the right to decide the area of
      redeployment without consultation with the Palestinian side and continues
      to give preference to the Syrian track, signalling to the Palestinians
      that in order for them to join the peace process they must give more
      concessions; this is their way of forcing them to accept the settlement

      security hegemony over most of the Palestinian occupied territories; to
      secure military supremacy over its Arab neighbours; and to enhance its
