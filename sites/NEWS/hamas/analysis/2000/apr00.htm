      response to his description of Lebanese resistance as terrorism, they were
      thus reflecting the greater Arab stance as far as the geographic framework
      is concerned. They were also reflecting a more comprehensive political
      stand. For after freezing the settlement process on the Syrian and
      Palestinian tracks, the Israeli government spread rumours that an
      atmosphere of escalation and war was prevailing in the region. That was
      evident in Israeli foreign minister David Levy’s calls for shedding the
      blood of the Lebanese people and children in retaliation to attacks by the
      heroic Lebanese resistance against occupation soldiers and their proxy
      militias in South Lebanon.<o:p>

      framework and ended with an official one represented in the meeting of the
      Arab foreign ministers in Beirut, which passed resolutions expressing
      disappointment at the progress of that process. The resolutions also
      displayed a certain extent of differences among Arab countries and their

10.0pt">A few months after the election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister of the
      Zionist entity, the settlement process witnessed progress in the form of
      the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian and Palestinian levels.
      However, the progress was quickly confronted by obstacles owing to
      hesitance by the Barak government in offering the necessary requirements
      for that process. These are topped by the withdrawal to the 4 June 1967
      borders and the implementation of the third redeployment stage stipulated
      in the Wye River and Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, in addition to concluding
      a framework agreement for the final status settlement and reaching a
      comprehensive and final agreement by 5 September 2000. The speedy collapse
      of the negotiations on the Syrian and Palestinian tracks at almost the
      same time, coupled with the Zionist entity’s escalation against Lebanon
      by striking its civilian installations in response to resistance attacks,
      had a direct negative impact on the Arab region. That impact led the Arab
      foreign ministers to hold a meeting in Beirut earlier last month, most
      resolutions of which included: asking the Arab countries to reconsider
      normalization of relations with the Zionist entity and participation in
      the multilateral negotiations. They also affirmed the Arab countries’
      absolute backing of Lebanon in resisting Israeli occupation in its
      capacity as a legitimate self-defence. They also affirmed rejection of
      re-settling the refugees outside Palestine and called for their return to
      their homeland while focusing on the importance of solving the issue of
      Palestinian refugees residing in Lebanon.<o:p>

      Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak succeeded in holding a summit meeting
      grouping him with Barak and Arafat in Sharm el-Sheikh that resulted in the
      resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and paved the way for the
      Palestinian Authority’s approval of the redeployment maps as presented
      by the Israeli government. The redeployment was slightly changed by
      eliminating the village of Abu Dees, near Al-Quds (Jerusalem), from the
      withdrawal plan and replacing it with two other villages: Obeidiya, near
      Abu Dees, and Beytonia, located to the west of Ramallah. New dates were
      agreed upon during that summit namely fixing May as the final date for
      reaching a framework agreement for a final settlement, June or July for a
      third withdrawal from the West Bank while retaining the former date of
      September.<o:p>

      Beirut meeting when differences erupted between Egypt and Syria over the
      topics of normalization and multilateral negotiations. Egypt refused
      Syria’s demand for halting normalization and non-participation in the
      multilateral negotiations, which led to a compromise resolution that
      called for commitment to the settlement process while the most important
      and prominent decision was supporting the Lebanese resistance, which
      raised Washington’s and Tel Aviv’s worries.<o:p>

      down following lengthy reports of secret talks held through American
      mediation and the emergence of pointers indicating Barak’s readiness to
      recognize Rabin’s deposited pledge with the American administration. For
      the summit meeting held between the Syrian and American presidents in
      Geneva last 26 March had failed to reach a suitable formula for resumption
      of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The failure was attributed to the
      Israeli party’s refusal to offer a clear-cut pledge to withdraw to the 4
      June borders and their insistence on retaining the northeastern beach of
      Lake Tiberias, which falls within the Syrian side according to those
      borders. That stance was adopted despite Syria’s flexibility in
      accepting the Zionist entity’s retention of the sources of river waters
      that fall in that Lake, in addition to indications that it was ready to
      accept changes on the border line with the Hebrew State so that it would
      pass between the international borders delineated by the 7 March 1923
      agreement between France and Britain and the 4 June 1967 border line,
      which demarcates Syria’s borders before the 5 June 1967 war.<o:p>

      amendments on the 4 June border line that does not include Al-Himma area
      but also drawing back the 4 June line at Tiberias towards the east by
      100–200 metres, a matter that would guarantee Israel’s control over
      Lake Tiberias from all sides. The Israelis accepted, meanwhile, to allow
      the Syrians to reach the northeastern beach without having to obtain a
      prior Israeli entry visa in return for reciprocal arrangements allowing
      the Israelis to enter Al-Himma that would be returned to Syria in the

      since differences between the two sides are no longer that big. Yet they
      are linked to details that would make the negotiations arduous and tough

      peace treaty with Syria that would allow it to arrange for a withdrawal
      from South Lebanon within an agreement with Lebanon before the date of 1
      July fixed by the Israeli government to pull out its troops from there.
      This is confirmed by the fact that Barak postponed approval of the
      unilateral withdrawal plan presented to him by the Israeli army in a bid
      to allow more room for success of negotiation with Syria, taking into
      consideration the fact that the unilateral withdrawal plan will be
      different from a pullout following a peace agreement with Lebanon. The
      latter, which was code-named “New Horizon”, stipulates the evacuation
      of the Israeli occupation army to the international borders while the
      other one code-named “Morning Dusk” stipulates retaining a number of
      areas within a narrow security border strip along the borders with Lebanon
