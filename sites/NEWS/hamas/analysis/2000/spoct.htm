      political analysis on<br>
      The Israeli stance towards the Intifadha</font></h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">28/10/2000AD</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">No doubt the outbreak of the Aqsa Intifadha amidst the ongoing final
      settlement negotiations posed as a big surprise. However, the greater
      surprise was continuation of the Intifadha for a full month until now. The
      third and no less great surprise was the labor leftist government of
      Barak’s decision to escalate the military situation against the
      Palestinians and to deal a violent blow to the settlement process, which
      some believed that his government only came for the sake of pushing it
      forward.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">So what is the real stand of the Barak government regarding the
      settlement and the Intifadha? Where is the internal Israeli reaction
      heading in the light of the Intifadha? And what is the effect of such
      development in the Israeli stand on the settlement process and the
      Intifadha?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Barak’s coup … reasons and motives</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">When the Camp David summit failed to reach a final peace treaty between
      Arafat and Barak, the question of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) was atop of the
      issues that led to failure of that summit. Barak was not ready to accept
      the Arab-backed Palestinian minimum demand for sovereignty over the old
      city of Al-Quds. Such a situation was further complicated with Barak
      government’s loss of its parliamentary majority in the Knesset and the
      opposition success, after the Shas party (Barak’s former ally) joined
      it, in passing the first reading of a resolution to dissolve the Israeli
      Knesset and launch early elections. Ever since that moment Barak gave up
      responding to American pressures and gave up his attempt to show himself
      as the Israeli leader that will succeed in achieving peace with the Arab
      countries. He started to focus instead on surviving atop of the authority
      for the longest possible period because opting to new elections without an
      accomplishment on the settlement process would lead to his loss in face of
      his opponent Netanyahu.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Israeli sources, meanwhile, leaked information that Barak had started
      coordinating with Sharon (current Likud leader) since the Camp David II
      negotiations. They said that Barak used to inform Sharon and consult with
      him over those talks on daily basis. Such information indicated that full
      coordination was maintained between Barak and Sharon over the latter’s
      visit to the Haram Al-Sharif on 28/9/2000, which triggered the Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">For his part, deputy Rubi Revelin, head of the Likud bloc in the Knesset,
      asserted that Israeli security bodies had encouraged the visit. He told
      the Hebrew daily ‘Ma’ariv’ in a statement published on the day of
      the visit, “They have agreed to our position that Jews should not be
      deprived of visiting the Haram, which is in the heart of the Jewish people
      and in the heart of Al-Quds, only out of fear of Palestinian violent
      threats. The security apparatuses have agreed to our opinion that if we
      surrendered the Haram they will continue to blackmail us.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Another daily ‘Yediot Ahranot’ affirmed, in an article by its
      Washington correspondent, that the American administration had expressed
      in behind-the-scene chatting its anger over Sharon’s visit “behind
      closed doors they were infuriated by the performance of both Barak and Ben
      Amy … in one of the meetings, the supposition was tabled that Barak had
      allowed Sharon to head to the Haram in a premeditated mean manner so that
      the escalation would occur and as such he would escape from the peace
      process. Barak, according to such a supposition, was terrified by Camp
      David and was searching for a way to escape from registering his name in
      history books as the one who divided Al-Quds …”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Apparently, Barak who reached a conviction that it was difficult to reach
      a peace treaty that would include Al-Quds with the Palestinians along with
      the approaching final days of his government with the reopening of the
      Knesset session this month, he decided to try and form a national unity or
      emergency government with the Likud in its capacity as his only available
      rescue boat. Barak’s interests here met with those of Sharon who do not
      wish for new Knesset elections because that would entail internal
      elections within Likud to choose a candidate for premiership, which would
      be Netanyahu and not Sharon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Within this context, the Israeli army’s excessive use of violence
      against demonstrators could be explained namely shooting at their heads
      and chests with the aim of inflicting biggest possible martyrs and wounded
      in their lines along with boosting Israeli presence at entrance of
      Palestinian cities and using bombs, tanks and helicopter gunships in
      shelling Palestinian Authority areas. Furthermore, Barak declared
      temporary suspension of the settlement process to pave the way for a new
      national unity government that would group most of the major right and
      left parties.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Unity in face of the Intifadha</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">It is an eye-catching fact that the Israeli government’s policy in
      dealing with the Intifadha was largely supported by other Israeli parties
      even the leftists. Moshe Raz, secretary of the peace now movement told the
      Hebrew service of radio Israel on 12/10/00 that the Israeli bombardment of
      PA areas was “a legitimate act under prevailing circumstances.” He
      praised the Israeli army steps, adding, “Palestinians should know that
      by crossing the redlines they would only bring destruction to
      themselves.” He advised them to stop the violence and return to the
      negotiating table!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">For his part, Yossi Sarid, leader of the Meretz party one of the most
      prominent leftist parties, said, “The bombing operations were necessary
      for the peace process, because it is important that the Palestinians must
      know that any duplicity between negotiations and violence would only lead
      to more losses in their lines.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Other right and religious parties such as Mifdal and Shas were fervent
      supporters of the Barak government, his call for suspending the settlement
      process and orders to the army to quell the Palestinian demonstrators.
      Many of them also focused on importance of adopting deterring measures
      against Palestinians of the 1948 occupied lands who shared in the
      Intifadha. They doubted those people’s patriotism and considered them a
      fifth column in the Hebrew state.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Israeli premier started his intransigent stands by charging the PA
      with planning the “acts of violence”, charging that Arafat was able to
      stop them if he wished. Barak then declared that the settlement process
      had ended as one of his close friends told daily ‘Ma’ariv’ on
      13/10/2000 that the “political process had totally collapsed and had
      terminated and there is no chance to mend it now.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Barak was keen to point out that Arafat was no longer a partner in the
      settlement process in an attempt to justify freezing the settlement
      process.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The un-coronated leader of the Likud opposition party Benjamin Netanyahu,
      in an article published in ‘Yediot Ahranot’ on 6/10/00, criticized
      Barak’s weak policy towards the Palestinians and Arabs, which led to the
      outbreak of the Intifadha, saying, “A divided Israel, riddled by
      disputes, is a weak Israel that could not achieve peace or crystallize it.
      Such a situation encourages the Arab concept that the Jewish state was a
      passing phenomenon and only needs a little push or continuous operations
      of attrition and corrosion so that the whole building would fall down.
      This is the main motive behind the events that took place in the past
      weeks and not the pretext of Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Haram.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">As for the Israeli papers, which usually reflect the opinions of the
      intellectuals and the general Israeli popular trends, they adopted
      Barak’s use of force to stop the Palestinian violence, blaming Yasser
      Arafat for the Aqsa Intifadha. They considered that Arafat could end it,
      reiterating the Barak government’s declarations and ignoring the true
      stands of the Palestinian street that was desperate over prospects of the
      settlement process that did not achieve anything for them on the ground in
      addition to repeated Israeli provocations to worshippers in the Haram Al-Sharif,
      which was the spark that kindled the Aqsa Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Israeli opinion polls showed that the public opinion was heading towards
      more intransigence in dealing with the settlement process. In a
      comprehensive poll on the general Israeli trends launched by the Dahef
      institution by the end of last September only 26% of those polled said
      they believed in the settlement process. The percentage three months after
      Barak’s election in September 1999 over the same issue reached 46%. It
      is worth mentioning that the same poll pointed out that 83% of the
      Israelis viewed that “unity of the people” was in a bad condition, a
      matter that displayed the severity of discrepancy and differences in the
      Israeli society due to political, social and racial affiliations, which
      had a clear impact on the Knesset elections of 1999.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Another poll was conducted by the Israeli daily ‘Ma’ariv’ and
      published on 13/10/00 in response to a single question: Is there a partner
      for peace in the Palestinian side? It showed that 62% of Israelis
      responded “no” while only 27% responded “yes”.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">When they were asked on Jewish atrocities against Arabs of the 1948
      areas, 73% declared their support and sympathy with such acts while only
      25% were against them!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Moreover, 70% supported the formation of an Israeli national emergency
      government under present circumstances.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">New war government</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Most prominent results of the Aqsa Intifadha was that it displayed how
      deeply-rooted extremism and fanaticism was in the Israeli street and
      politics. It also revealed that the Israelis were adamant on subduing the
      Palestinian people and giving them only the minimum possible limit of
      lands in addition to depriving them of forming a real sovereign state not
      even on lands occupied in 1967 only. It further exposed the clear racism
      in dealing with Palestinian inhabitants of the 1948 areas especially after
      they shared in the Aqsa Intifadha at its early days in retaliation to
      Israeli policy of aggression and terrorism against their brothers in the
      1967 occupied territories. Israeli premier Ehud Barak had uncovered such a
      mentality in the press conference held in Tel Aviv on 5/10/00 when he
      said, “After 52 years of Israel’s establishment, we are still fighting
      against terrorism, the time had not come yet to put down our swords.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">It was no coincidence that Barak and Sharon had agreed on provoking the
      Palestinians in a bid to assert Israeli sovereignty over Al-Quds and the
      blessed Aqsa Mosque and to affirm that they would not allow the
      Palestinians to impose their political stands through the use of the
      popular Intifadha or any other form of violence, which should be the sole
      concern of the Israelis in their capacity as the stronger party.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Within this context, Tanya Rinehart, professor at Tel Aviv University
      described in an article published in daily ‘Yediot Ahranot’ on
      10/10/00 the stands of the Israeli governments, which maintained stringent
      measures against the Palestinians saying, “On the eve of Oslo the
      Palestinian people extended their hands for peace filled with hope and
      enthusiasm and peace was near. But we faced the extended hand with the
      victorious’ slackening after forgetting the Intifadha. And as long as
      the Palestinians ceded more, they asked them for more …”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Israeli government apparently decided its option by heading towards a
      national unity government that would group it with the Likud and other
      parties. Such a government would direct a new blow to the settlement
      process, which many consider as dead or in a state of extended coma. It
      would also lead to continuation of the Israeli policy of escalation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Description of the leftist writer Haim Hanegby in the ‘Ma’ariv’
      newspaper on 24/10/00 of such a government would be enough when he said,
      “the government of the two Generals that is threatening an explosion at
      any time would be a government of blood, fire and gun smoke. Apparently
      there is no one doubting that fact whether in Israel or outside it.”</p>
