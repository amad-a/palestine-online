      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Results
      of the Camp David summit, which concluded late July, posed as a main axis
      in the settlement process that started in Oslo almost seven years ago. The
      summit was no different from the overall ambiguity that shaped that
      process as evident from the little information leaking on its results so
      far.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      summit, which America hoped would end up in a “semi-final” agreement
      or what could be described as a “final-transitional” agreement, did
      not approve any solution to the sovereignty over Jerusalem based on the
      principle of “intentional ambiguity” that governed the basic agreement
      in Oslo–a matter which made the American administration declare the
      negotiations a failure after trying to postpone the issue for a few days.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><b><font color="#0000FF">The
      Camp’s prologues<o:p>

      </font></b></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      Camp David negotiations started on 11 July 2000 after the secret channel
      talks, which opened in Tel Aviv then moved to Stockholm before returning
      to Tel Aviv, reached specific understandings between Arafat’s and
      Barak’s negotiators on final status issues. Those included Jerusalem,
      refugees, settlements, sovereignty and borders with the exception of
      sovereignty over Jerusalem’s old quarters, which is part and parcel of
      East Jerusalem. This question was left to direct contact between Arafat
      and Barak. Despite realizing the sensitivity of that question, Clinton
      finally decided to host a summit for Barak and Arafat with the aim of
      reaching a final settlement even if it did not include a solution on
      Jerusalem. Apparently he believed that it could be postponed to later
      negotiations and that he could guarantee Arab pressure on Arafat to accept
      such a solution. However, this did not happen. He, along with his foreign
      secretary, contacted leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Morocco to
      perform that role. It was eye-catching to note that Egypt refused to
      perform such a role but rather tried to further solidify Arafat’s stand
      and pressure him not to offer any concessions regarding sovereignty over
      Jerusalem. The same stance was adopted by Saudi Arabia, which considers
      itself responsible for Islamic shrines in the Arab world.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      Egyptian-Saudi position vis-&agrave;-vis the sovereignty over East
      Jerusalem had a direct impact on Arafat’s stand which had previously
      included many concessions even during the Camp David negotiations
      regarding the issues of the refugees, settlements, sovereignty and
      borders. However, he could not go further because of the united Arab stand
      and the internal Palestinian situation, which was not in favour of
      negotiations and capitulation but rather backed resistance and force
      against occupation following success of Hizbullah in defeating the Israeli
      occupation and forcing the Barak government to withdraw its forces from
      South Lebanon.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As
      for the Israelis, they were not prepared to yield anything on the issue of
      sovereignty over Jerusalem especially when Barak looked weak before his
      coalition government that started planning his downfall as a punishment
      for showing “flexibility” regarding the final status issues. This was
      topped by his preparedness to give up Palestinian areas to the north and
      south of Jerusalem in return for annexing the main settlement blocs near
      the holy city. Furthermore, Barak’s five “NOs” with which he went to
      Camp David II remained unchanged during the talks with only formal
      solutions proposed for them. Those are: A religious and municipal solution
      to Jerusalem (reparations and re-settlement of refugees while allowing
      100,000 of them to return within family reunion programmes after
      considering such a step as an Israeli recognition of resolution 194 but
      without shouldering any civilian or legal responsibility regarding their
      forced emigration); retaining 80% of settlements and annexing them to the
      Zionist entity in return for eliminating other minor pockets (maintaining
      a security presence whenever necessary at the Jordan Valley and preventing
      the Authority from having military presence in that area or forging
      alliances with Arab countries as well as banning the entry of any foreign
      army through that area); annexing settlements to the east of the Green
      Line; expanding Jerusalem’s borders giving the Palestinians around 94%
      of the West Bank areas (excluding Jerusalem); and retaining part of that
      94% in the hands of the Israelis for a ten-year period and renting others
      for a period that could extend to 25 years as leaked from the secret
      Stockholm negotiations.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Despite
      Clinton and his administration’s realization before the Camp David II
      summit, he was keen on its convening equipped with his ability to pressure
      Arafat and the Arab countries to secure a political notch on his belt
      which in turn would reflect well on his deputy Al Gore in his bid to
      secure the presidency in the upcoming elections. The summit, however,
      proved that the Jerusalem question could serve as an explosive factor to
      the negotiations and that it would remain, for a certain time at least, a
      major obstacle to reaching a final settlement in view of its religious and
      historic importance, surpassing all other complicated issues such the
      refugees and settlements.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

      accurate information is yet available on the results of Camp David II
      owing to the imposed secrecy on the part of the American administration
      over progress of the negotiations. It is not clearly known whether
      understandings were reached on the issues of refugees, settlements and
      sovereignty along with the extent of those understandings and their
      details. However, the Israeli press was full of reports on results of
      those talks and proposals tabled therein. The reports pointed out that the
      Israeli party was the one that tabled speculations on a final solution and
      that the Palestinian side was content with responding to such speculations
      and tabling amendments. For its part, the Clinton administration was
      trying to bridge those two stands by presenting a speculation that was
      nearer to the Israeli side owing to well-known strategic considerations
      and to that administration’s need for the Jewish vote in the American
      presidential elections.</span></p>

      Keeping that State divided (separating the West Bank from the Gaza
      Strip–splitting the West Bank into two big cantons at least) and linking
      those areas via safe passages under Palestinian administration but at the
      mercy of occupation, which would impose conditions of passing through
      them.<o:p>

      The Hebrew State agrees to the return of around 100,000 of them under

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">3.
      Resolving the Jerusalem issue according to three framework agreements:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">(a)
      The geo-political framework stipulating that the Hebrew State would give
      up suburbs in the north and the south of Jerusalem that would be annexed
      to the West Bank, including Abu Dees, Alezariye and eastern Sawahre where
      the Palestinians can call those areas Jerusalem and their capital.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">(b)
      The civilian municipal framework, which comprises East Jerusalem, where
      the Palestinians would be granted in that part (Beit Hanina-Shaafat) a
      civilian administration affiliated with the Palestinian Authority with the
      possibility of linking it to West Jerusalem through a municipality
      covering both sectors. The Palestinians would run a branch municipality
      within the framework of the Israeli higher municipal council while
      depriving them from planning and construction jurisdictions.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">(c)
      The religious framework allowing a Palestinian, Arab, Islamic and
      Christian administration of holy shrines in the old city of Jerusalem in
      accordance with one of the tabled proposals stipulating the division of
      the Christian management so that part of it would be under Islamic
      administration and the other under Jewish administration. The
      Palestinians, in accordance with that proposal, would be allowed to hoist
      the Palestinian flag over the Islamic and Christian shrines along with a
      safe passage linking northern Jerusalem, which would be annexed to the
      West Bank, to those areas so that Palestinians and Muslims would not pass
      through lands under Israeli sovereignty.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
      is noteworthy that the proposal on Jerusalem can be summarized in allowing
      the Israeli side to have the upper hand in sovereignty issues over
      Jerusalem after expanding its borders to reach around 550 square
      kilometres which would double its current area five times after annexing
      the Israeli settlements. The Palestinians would be granted civilian,
      municipal and religious jurisdictions over inhabitants and not the lands
      in East Jerusalem. The dual sovereignty proposed by the American
      administration did not get far from the previous proposals with the
      exception that it adds the term “sovereignty” over Palestinian
      civilian and administrative jurisdictions suggested by the Israelis within
      East Jerusalem while postponing a solution over old Jerusalem to later
      negotiations, that being it endorses Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem,
      which made Israeli premier Ehud Barak accept it while the Palestinians
      rejected it because it did not differ in essence from the Israeli
      proposal.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
      <br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><b><font color="#0000FF">What
      would follow the failure of the Camp David negotiations?<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></b></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hence,
      Jerusalem was the obstacle at which the negotiations crashed, especially
      the issue of sovereignty over the eastern sector, including the holy
      shrines. The Israelis stuck to their position and won a clear American
      backing at the summit while Arafat could not extend his concessions to
      include Jerusalem during that summit.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      summit failed to reach a “semi-final” agreement owing to the Israeli
      party’s insistence on securing a Palestinian-Arab statement ending the
      conflict. Barak wished to sign an agreement comprising all issues
      (Jerusalem-refugees-sovereignty-borders) and refused to sign any partial
      agreement without including Jerusalem and ending the conflict. The
      agreement was supposed to contain articles stipulating the continuation of
      talks over Jerusalem. Apparently, even Arafat was not prepared to accept
      such an agreement at the present time.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Camp
      David II, though, did not reach a written agreement on a final settlement,
      yet it could serve as a step towards that target and it might have
      displayed the real obstacles that prevented conclusion of such an
      agreement.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      coming weeks will be decisive in determining the place and time of signing
      the final settlement, especially when the summit did not end in complete
      success nor complete failure.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Furthermore,
      the limited remaining period for the present American administration (till
      November) coupled with the Arab solid stance in insisting on sovereignty
      over East Jerusalem, which prevented the collapse of the Palestinian
      Authority, indicate that probability of reaching a final settlement within
      that period was not realistic.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Reports
      are currently circulating that a summit will be soon held between Arafat
      and Barak, yet its convening was not sure before the uninterrupted
      (Palestinian-Israeli) negotiations result in “creative” solutions to
      the question of Jerusalem since “creativity” of former solutions did
      not lead to solving that complicated block since the Abu Mazen-Pelen
      document in 1995.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      Jerusalem problem will remain a major hurdle before the settlement process
      but it is not the only one. There is the refugees’ issue, which will
      continue to urge millions of Palestinians to reject any solutions that do
      not include their right of return to their country and lands. Furthermore,
      the limited space of the Palestinian State and partitioning its areas will
      not serve as a suitable atmosphere for economic and political stability in
      the Palestinian lands. Such a situation would boost importance of federal
      relations with Jordan and chances of continuing the Palestinian problem
      owing to the absence of settlements meeting Palestinian aspirations for
      national identity and restoring Palestinian national rights.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
      proposed final settlement would not serve as a final solution in the true
      sense of the word nor through the practical formulas it would accomplish.
      The negotiations on pending issues
      (refugees-Jerusalem-settlements-borders) between the Hebrew State and the
      meager Palestinian State, which would be found in accordance with the
      final-transitional settlement, will continue. Meanwhile, the problems,
      which would not be solved immediately, would carry negative repercussions
      on later agreements and negotiations.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">However,
      in the event no final settlement is reached, the results would carry even
      greater negative effects and might lead to Palestinian confrontations and
      uprisings against the Zionist entity and even against the Palestinian
      Authority, whose repression of the Palestinian people would greatly
      increase. This would lead concerned parties in the next stage–in the
      event no final agreement was reached–to search for alternative formulas,
      the priorities of which would be allowing establishment of a Palestinian
      State that should accord pledges to the Israelis cancelling any future
      demands for the withdrawal of the Hebrew State to the pre-1967 borders.<o:p>
