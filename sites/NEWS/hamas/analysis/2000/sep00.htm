      Jerusalem the only remaining obstacle in the negotiations?<br>
      “We have come to the “Temple Mount” and we will never depart from
      it” …</font></h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This statement, which was voiced by acting Israeli foreign minister
      Shlomo Ben Amy a few days ago, summarizes to a great extent the Israeli
      stand vis-&agrave;-vis the hectic, marathon negotiations currently being
      held over Jerusalem after the failure of the Camp David II in solving it.
      It also explains the big, and sometimes confusing number of proposals
      tabled to solve the religious sovereignty over the Aqsa Mosque and its
      precincts, which Egyptian foreign minister Amre Mousa said had reached 21
      proposals! The stringent stands of the Israeli “doves” government
      urged the American administration, which already wishes to accelerate any
      solution in its short remaining period in office, to crystallize ideas
      that cope with Israeli demands and do not raise much anger on the Arab
      countries, which are embarrassed and reject Israeli sovereignty over the
      Aqsa Mosque.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Proposals for sovereignty and religious administration of Jerusalem</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Camp David II ended without reaching an agreement including Jerusalem
      despite the fact that other understandings were reached regarding the
      refugees, settlements, sovereignty and borders. However, the Jerusalem
      question still remains the most important obstacle before concluding a
      final peace agreement. The Hebrew state still insists on retaining
      sovereignty over both eastern and western sectors of Jerusalem within the
      framework of a “greater Jewish Jerusalem” through annexing nearby
      settlements without ignoring possibility of concluding solutions that do
      not bypass this “red line”. It had drawn that line with the support of
      blind American bias, which was eminent in the American administration’s
      adoption of proposals closer to the Israeli stands. Such proposals
      stipulate dividing sovereignty over the Haram Al-Sharif leaving the Aqsa
      Mosque and Dome of the Rock under Palestinian control along with that of
      their yards with a symbolic Israeli presence while giving the Israeli
      control over the Buraq Wall (Wailing Wall) and the area underneath the
      mosques along with a Palestinian symbolic presence. The Palestinians
      rejected the proposal backed by an Egyptian-Saudi position calling for
      complete sovereignty on those areas and rejecting any division of it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Egypt, following a series of American pressures, tabled a non-written
      proposal suggesting Palestinian sovereignty on all areas of the Haram Al-Sharif
      and old Jerusalem while allowing Israeli control over the Buraq Wall and
      the Jewish suburb. However, the proposal was not accepted by the Barak
      government, which insisted on retaining control over all areas of old
      Jerusalem including the Haram area while allowing the Palestinians
      administrative control on mosques and yards on the ground leaving what is
      beneath to the Israelis who claim presence of the Solomon’s temple
      there.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Palestinian Authority showed flexibility towards the American
      proposal, which Barak enthusiastically accepted as basis of negotiations
      in the event the Palestinians accepted it. Sources said that the Authority
      offered sharing control over the Buraq Wall with the Israelis in return
      for accepting joint sovereignty over the mosques.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Yet the Barak government was still insisting on rejecting Palestinian
      control<span style="mso-spacerun: yes" lang="AR-SA" dir="RTL">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>on
      the Haram, old Jerusalem and the east sector of the city. It expressed
      readiness to grant the PA religious jurisdictions in the Haram area in
      addition to municipal authority in old Jerusalem and the eastern part of
      it and allowing PA control on outskirts of the city. This continued to be
      the main Israeli position that hurdled any progress in the negotiations
      despite the PA and other Arab countries’ concentration on religious
      sovereignty over the Haram and the old quarters, which indicate a retreat
      in demands of controlling eastern Jerusalem.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Authorizing sovereignty … between the Palestinian and the Israeli
      stands</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Such a stringent stance led the PA to declare, as voiced by head of the
      Palestinian legislative council Ahmed Qrei, its readiness to accept
      internationalizing Jerusalem in a bid to pressure Barak to be more
      flexible so as not to discuss a proposal always rejected by the Hebrew
      state because it included western Jerusalem that was not tabled for
      negotiations in the first place. However, few days after that suggestion
      Arafat announced a new proposal, which is different from the first one
      since it was tabled for real negotiations and not merely propaganda
      tactics. He declared his preparedness to accept converting sovereignty
      over the Haram to the Jerusalem committee, an affiliate of the Islamic
      Conference Organization. He specifically mentioned granting Egypt, Saudi
      Arabia and Morocco such dominance that would entrust the Palestinian side
      with sovereignty over the areas, that is granting the PA “religious
      administration” of those areas. Despite the PA’s denial of what was
      published in the Hebrew daily ‘Ha’aretz’ that Arafat had proposed to
      Clinton a joint Islamic-international control of the Haram, yet the offer
      was being developed. The Americans accepted the proposal while the
      Israelis viewed it with concern since it did not contain Palestinian
      sovereignty over the Haram and could be developed into a mere Islamic
      administration of Islamic holy shrines and an international control of
      Christian sacred shrines while retaining Israeli sovereignty on the area
      beneath the Haram, the Buraq Wall and the whole of the old city and
      eastern Jerusalem.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Shlomo Ben Amy repeatedly affirmed that his government was ready to allow
      “independent Palestinian administration” of the Islamic holy shrines
      as long as that meant ignoring Palestinian sovereignty over eastern
      Jerusalem.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Israeli government blackmails Palestinians and Arabs by focusing on
      its weak internal situation</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Apparently the proposal that was seriously discussed in the ongoing
      negotiations, which shifted from the US to the region, was shifting
      sovereignty on the Aqsa Mosque area to a certain party (international and
      Islamic) then authorizing the PA to run those areas. Despite the absence
      of clear indications on success of that suggestion, yet the few coming
      weeks would provide clear positions particularly when Barak was interested
      in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians before end of the
      Knesset’s summer vacation to avoid no confidence motions or dissolving
      the Knesset by rightist opposition parties. Meanwhile, the American
      administration wished that the concerned parties would sign a final
      agreement for the Palestine cause before end of the current session of the
      Congress and the general elections in November.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Barak is trying to use the card of his continuation in office to pressure
      the Palestinian party through saying that time was running out for
      concluding an agreement and spreading fears that the Israeli right parties
      would take over power returning the situation to that of Netanyahu’s era
      in the period 1996 to 1999.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Hence the repeated Israeli suggestions of reaching an agreement that
      leaves the question of Jerusalem to later negotiations hover. Arafat did
      not turn down the offer on condition that the agreement would not include
      an item declaring an end to the conflict as demanded by the Israeli
      government. Egypt, for its part, proposed reaching a final framework
      agreement in view of the complicating issue of Jerusalem that needed
      longer periods to solve but that proposal need a general settlement to the
      Jerusalem issue, which is what the American administration is currently
      seeking to hammer out.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Jerusalem ... a red line … will it be bypassed by the Palestinians and
      Arabs?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Continuation of negotiations and their concentration on sovereignty over
      old Jerusalem point to a retreat in the Palestinian and Arab positions at
      a time when no satisfactory solutions were reached on the overall issue of
      Jerusalem and other basic questions, in which big concessions were offered
      in Camp David II.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">While the Arab stand apparently insists on sovereignty over Jerusalem yet
      it focuses on old Jerusalem, which raises fears that the issue of
      sovereignty over eastern Jerusalem was bypassed after the issue of tabling
      both sectors of Jerusalem at the negotiating table and other sensitive
      questions were also avoided in a way coping with the Israeli viewpoint.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">However, the Jerusalem question remains the most sensitive and
      complicated issue and the one that activates the Palestinian and Arab
      masses as evident in what we witnessed of intensified popular moves in the
      past period.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Will the PA and the major Arab countries sidestep such a fact through
      accepting formal solutions to Jerusalem or will their realization of its
      seriousness prevent them from involving in such a step especially when
      faced with continued Israeli adamancy? This will be clarified within the
      few coming months.</p>
