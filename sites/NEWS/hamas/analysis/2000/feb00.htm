      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When
      the Syrian-Israeli negotiations were re-launched last December and when
      the negotiators began discussing the details of the understandings they
      reached during the tenures of Rabin’s government and the present
      government of Barak, optimists who believed in reaching a quick peace
      treaty between Syria and Israel began withdrawing their predictions as a
      result of the Israeli attempts to change the agenda of the negotiations
      and to adjourn the withdrawal of the Zionist troops from the Syrian Golan
      Heights. Instead, the Israelis wanted to achieve progress on the issues of
      security and normalization of ties with Syria. They even called upon Syria
      to introduce “goodwill” initiatives in order to convince the Israeli
      Street to vote for a peace treaty with Syria when it referred to an
      Israeli public referendum. The Israelis used to claim that it would be
      difficult for Barak’s government to introduce relinquishments and hence
      they need positive steps from Syria to help Barak to convince the Israelis
      that what the Jewish State will take from a peace treaty with Syria
      deserves the cost they are going to pay, i.e. the withdrawal from the
      Golan.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The third round of talks
      was adjourned when Syria rejected the Israeli agenda calling for giving
      priority to discussing the Israeli withdrawal. The talks were adjourned
      despite the significant progress achieved when the U.S. Administration
      introduced the so-called blueprint of a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty. But
      there remained some issues that were not agreed upon, especially setting
      the borders of the Israeli withdrawal, the security arrangements between
      Syria and Israel, the timetable of the withdrawal, the normalization of
      ties and the opening of embassies.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">Pending the resumption of
      the third round of talks in which the U.S. Administration will play an
      important role and which is expected soon, what has been achieved until
      now indicates a possibility to reach a peace agreement in the next few
      months. However, this may not be inevitable because the talks agenda
      contains many disputatious issues, which could extend the period of the
      negotiations and cause many crises similar to the present one. Barak will
      do his best to convince the Israelis to support a peace agreement with
      Syria, which will take a long time since any agreement should include a
      complete or semi-complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The Israelis
      are still divided over the acceptance of the withdrawal. According to the
      latest opinion poll conducted by the Israeli Gallop independent institute,
      50% of Israelis supported the withdrawal from the Golan, 37% opposed and
      13% were undecided. Also, the huge demonstration staged in Tel Aviv by
      150,000 Israelis protesting against a potential withdrawal indicates that
      such an opposition is strong, which in turn forces Barak to give it
      serious consideration, especially since some parties in his coalition
      government oppose the withdrawal as well.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear that Barak
      still prefers a peace agreement with both Syria and Lebanon as one package
      in order to obtain votes from the Israelis who strongly call to sign a
      peace treaty with Lebanon. Such a treaty is necessary, according to these
      Israelis, to guarantee a withdrawal of Israeli troops from South Lebanon
      because of their continuous defeats and relapses caused by Hizbullah
      fighters, who also threaten the Jewish settlements in the north of
      Occupied Palestine. Barak, through revealing that former Israeli Prime
      Minister Netanyahu had accepted in 1996 a complete withdrawal from the
      Golan, tried to weaken the Israeli Right, which now declares its rejection
      of a complete withdrawal from the Golan. Barak asserted that the deeds of
      the Israeli Right do not conform to its rejection and that in fact it does
      not differ from the Labour Party or the Israeli Left in general regarding
      the position over the withdrawal from the Golan.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">As it was expected, Barak
      succeeded in playing on the peace tracks by pressuring the Palestinian
      Authority to accept his proposals regarding the implementation of the
      redeployment as agreed upon in the recent Sharm el-Sheikh agreement. In
      particular, Barak wanted to make the PA accept his proposal on the second
      phase of redeployment even though it rejected it a few days after the
      resumption of the second round of Israeli-Syrian talks. On 6 January 2000,
      the Occupation troops redeployed from 5% of the West Bank after a
      three-month delay. However, the Israelis suspended the redeployment from
      6.1% of the West Bank in order to pressure the PA again into accepting the
      new maps of Israeli redeployment which aim at unifying the Israeli
      settlements in the West Bank while creating cantons of the Palestinian
      restored territories without a geographic connection.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">While the final status
      talks are still going in two separate lines—public and secret—the
      Israeli position regarding the issues of the refugees, Jerusalem and
      Jewish settlements has not been changed. It was also learned that the PA
      clearly exhibited flexibility in an attempt to achieve the agenda of the
      final status talks by its scheduled timetable—7 February 2000. It seems
      that the PA is convinced that it is necessary to rush to reach any
      agreement with the Israelis even if the PA is forced to introduce more
      relinquishments. The PA wants to prevent Barak from marginalizing the
      negotiations with the Palestinians in favour of the Syrian track. It also
      wants to make use of the U.S. Administration’s desire to reach a
      Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the final status before the end of
      Clinton’s term in the White House, which in turn could support the
      position of the Democratic candidate for the upcoming presidential
      elections. Contrary to what the PA opines, Barak might be concerned in
      reaching a quick agreement with the Palestinians to benefit from the
      fragile position of the PA and to achieve the American Administration’s
      desire to sign this agreement very soon.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The Israeli fears of
      forging such an agreement focus on security, on which Barak’s government
      is keen to concentrate with its talks with Syria, Lebanon and the PA.
      Therefore, the Israeli government wants to reach certain arrangements,
      such as creating buffer zones with its Arab neighbours, establishing early
      warning stations, reducing the number of Syrian army personnel in the
      Golan Heights, and preventing the Palestinians from establishing an
      independent State and from taking control of the borders with the
      neighbouring Arab countries. The crossing points and the bridges will
      continue to remind the Palestinians that their dream to expand their State
      and to restore more of their occupied land would be disappointed and
      frustrated.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The coming phase will be
      decisive and critical regarding the peace process. It will draw the
      characteristics of the Syrian-Israeli peace settlement and the final
      solution on the Palestinian track. It is likely that Barak will seek to
      achieve parallel agreements with Syrians, Lebanese and the Palestinians
      and will introduce them as one package to be voted on by the Israelis.
      However, it is more likely that Barak will concentrate on reaching
      agreements with the Syrians and Lebanese, without the Palestinians.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">The Palestinian
      Opposition, which will face difficult circumstances especially when Syria
      signs a peace settlement with the Zionist Regime and because the Arab
      governments will rush to normalize relations with the Jewish State, is
      preparing to set a new Palestinian national project that is able to treat
      the imbalance and the relinquishments introduced by the PA and which seeks
      to protect the rights of the Palestinian People.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">As the Palestinian
      negotiations failed to restore the basic Palestinian rights which are
      being discussed in the final status negotiations, the project of the
      Palestinian Opposition could be a suitable option for the Palestinian
      People in the coming period. But it will require a strong will to be
      implemented in this difficult period. It is also a real examination of the
      Palestinian Opposition in the coming phase.<o:p>
