    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Hamas</b> is an acronym that stands for the Islamic Resistance Movement, a popular

    national resistance movement which is working to create conditions conducive to

    emancipating the Palestinian people, delivering them from tyranny, liberating their land

    from the occupying usurper, and to stand up to the Zionist scheme which is supported by

    neo-colonist forces.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas is a Jihadi (fighting for a holy purpose) movement in the broad sense of the word

    Jihad. It is part of the Islamic awakening movement and upholds that this awakening is the

    road which will lead to the liberation of Palestine from the river to the sea. It is also

    a popular movement in the sense that it is a practical manifestation of a wide popular

    current that is deeply rooted in the ranks of the Palestinian people and the Islamic

    nation. It is a current which sees in the Islamic faith and doctrines a firm base in which

    to work against an enemy which endorses religious ideologies and plots which counter act

    all plans to lift up the Palestinian nation. The Hamas movement groups in its ranks all

    those who believe in its ideology and principles and all who are prepared to endure the

    consequences of the conflict and to confront the Zionist scheme.</font></p>

    <p><big><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><a NAME="anchor214634"></a><b>The Movement's emblem</b></font></big></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The movement's emblem consists of a picture of the mosque of the Dome of the Rock. At

    the top of the emblem is a small map of Palestine and surrounding it are two Palestinian

    flags in a semicircular shape which appear as if they were embracing the Dome. The right

    flag bears the phrase, &quot;There is no god but Allah,&quot; and the left flag bears the

    phrase, &quot;Mohammed is the messenger of Allah.&quot; Under the Dome are two swords

    which cross one another at the dome's base and drift apart forming a lower frame for the

    Dome. &quot;Palestine&quot; is written under the picture and below it is a strip with the

    phrase, &quot;Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The picture of the mosque together with the phrases &quot;There is no god but

    Allah,&quot; and &quot;Mohammed is the Messenger of Allah,&quot; symbolize the Islamic

    character of the cause and its ideological essence. The map is indicative of Hamas'

    attitude that the conflict aims to restore (from the occupiers) the entire Palestine with

    its Mandate borders and that Hamas rejects the issue to be limited to the lands occupied

    in 1967.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two swords symbolize the images of might and nobility that have always dwelled in

    the Arab mind. In its fight against an enemy who pays no heed to any human values, Hamas

    adheres to the values of nobility and honor and targets its might against its actual

    enemy, relentlessly and without deviation.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><big><a NAME="anchor218951"></a><b>Evolution and development</b></big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas, issued its initiating statement on December 15,

    1987. However, the movement's evolution goes back to the 1940s, as it is an extension of

    the Muslim Brotherhood movement. Before announcing their movement, Muslim Brothers used

    other names to express their political attitudes towards the Palestinian Question. These

    included Al Morabitour (those firmly stationed) on the Land of Isra' (the Nocturnal

    journey), the &quot;Islamic Struggle Movement,&quot; and other names.</font></p>

    <p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">First: Causes Of Evolution:</font></i></b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas-emerged as a result of interaction between a

    number of elements the Palestinian people have endured since the catastrophe of 1948 in

    general and the 1967 setback in particular. These emanate from two main factors: the

    political development of the Palestinian Question and what had become of it by the end of

    1967, and the development of the Islamic Awakening in Palestine and the level it reached

    in the mid 80s.</font></p>

    <p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">a. The Political Developments of the Palestine Question</font></i></b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the course of time, the Palestinian people could see that their cause, which they

    consider a matter of life and death and an encounter of the cultural conflict between the

    Arabs and Muslims on one side and the Zionists on the other, was being reduced to a

    problem of refugees after the catastrophe, and to a problem of removing the traces of

    aggression and giving up two thirds of Palestine after the defeat of 1967. This prompted

    the Palestinians to take their cause into their own hands which led to the<br>

    inception of the PLO and the popular resistance factions.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, the program of the Palestine revolution, which developed and crystallized

    inside the PLO, saw a number of internal and external setbacks which weakened it and made

    its vision confusing. The 70s had seen a number of indications that there would be the

    likelihood the PLO would accept a compromise at the expense of the inalienable rights of

    our people and nation and in contradiction of the provisions of the Palestinian National

    Charter. These indicators developed to become obvious Palestinian propositions which

    increased after the conclusion of the Camp David Accords and the Zionist invasion of south

    Lebanon and the subsequent siege of Beirut in 1982.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The siege was the biggest humiliation the Arab nation had suffered after the 1967 war

    despite the historic steadfastness of the Palestinian resistance in the city, for an Arab

    capital was besieged for a period of three months without any significant Arab reaction.

    This weakened the PLO and led to its exodus from Lebanon, which strengthened trends inside

    the PLO that called for a settlement with the enemy.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The propositions for the settlement included the following concessions which, up to

    then, had been fundamental issues in the conflict with Zionism.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Recognizing the Zionist entity and its right to exist on the land of Palestine.<br>

    2. Giving up to the Zionists, part, or rather the greater part, of Palestine.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Under these circumstances which satisfied PLO leaders, the strategy of armed struggle

    receded and Arab and international interest in the Palestine Question waned. Most of the

    Arab states were consciously or unconsciously pursuing country-centered policies where

    singleness of purpose was predominant. This was noticeable after the Arab League made a

    decision in 1974 recognizing the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the

    Palestinian people.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the eruption of the Iraqi-Irani War, the Palestine Question became a marginal

    issue on Arab and international levels. On the other hand, Zionism was adopting a harder

    line with the support of the United States with which it concluded a strategic cooperation

    treaty in 1981, the same year which saw the annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights and the

    destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While the Arab countries continued to cherish the illusion of attaching their hopes to

    the successive US administrations, Zionist extremism was growing more fervent as right

    wing parties dominated the entity's administration and policy. The policy of deterrence

    embraced by the Zionist entity for decades, was undisputed. Therefore, the Zionists

    arrogantly carried out the Hammam Al-Shat operation in Tunisia in October 1985 when it

    bombarded the PLO Headquarters there. These acts were met with full support from the US

    administration, the same administration that was the object of Arab hopes for achieving

    the ambitions of the various Arab summits.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the international level, the USA had made great strides, leaving the Soviet Union a

    long distance behind, by imposing its authority and hegemony on the region as well as on

    the whole world The mounting problems inside the Soviet Union required it to lend its

    attention to the local scene with the result that it gradually withdrew from regional

    conflicts and cleared the international scene for the Americans. The Soviet role in the

    region came to an end in a way that was not expected by the Arab governments and most of

    the Palestinian factions whose political position was severely damaged consequently.</font></p>

    <p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">b. The Islamic Awakening Axis</font></i></b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Palestine, like the other Arab countries, witnessed a remarkable Islamic awakening that

    led to the development and growth of the Islamic movement, in organizational and

    ideological terms, in the part of Palestine occupied in 1948 as well as in the Palestinian

    communities in the Diaspora.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Islamic current in Palestine became aware that it was facing a tremendous challenge

    which was due to two main causes:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">First-The decline of the Palestinian cause which plunged the bottom of the list of

    priorities for Arab countries.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second-The retreat of the Palestinian Revolution's program to confront Zionist

    ambitions and its effects on the position of having to live with those ambitions and of

    limiting the conflict to the conditions of this co-existence.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Under these two retreats, and with the accumulation of the negative impact of the

    repressive and tyrannical policies of the Zionist occupation, and with the idea of

    resistance ripening among the Palestinian people inside and outside Palestine, there had

    to be a &quot;Jihadi&quot; Islamic Palestinian project whose features began to appear in

    the &quot;Jihad Family&quot; in 1981 and in the league of Shaikh Ahmad Yassin in 1983 as

    well as in other groups.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the end of 1987, conditions had become ripe enough for the rise of a new faction

    that would confront Zionism as well as external transformations. Hence, the Islamic

    Resistance Movement-Hamas, emerged in response to the dilemma of the Palestinian people

    and what they and their just cause had gone through since the Zionist occupation of

    Palestinian land in 1967.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The consciousness of the Palestinian people in general and the Palestinian Islamic

    trend in particular contributed to crystallizing the Islamic Resistance Movement whose

    features began taking shape in the 80s. In that period, wings (extensions) were formed for

    the resistance apparatus and popular ground was consolidated to set the scene for

    launching the principles of the popular confrontation against the Zionist occupation. The

    students' confrontation with the occupation authorities in Najah and<br>

    Beir Zeit universities in the West Bank and in the Islamic University in Gaza contributed

    to creating conditions conducive for the Palestinian masses to indulge in resisting the

    occupation under the cumulative impact of the unfair policies, repressive measures and

    inhuman practices.</font></p>

    <p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman">Second: Development</font></i></b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The aggressive incident committed by a Zionist truck driver on December 6, 1987,

    against a car carrying Arab workers which resulted in the death of four Palestinian

    martyrs in Jabalia Camp of the Palestine Refugees ushered in a new era of our Palestinian

    people's Jihad. In retaliation, a state of general alarm was declared. The first statement

    of the Islamic Resistance<br>

    Movement was issued on December 15, 1987, marking a new phase in the Jihad of the

    Palestinians against the tyrant Zionist occupation, a phase where the Islamic trend was

    the spearhead of resistance.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rise of Hamas caused great concern to the enemy; so it mobilized its intelligence

    instruments to keep an eye on the movement and its leaders. As soon as the enemy realized

    that the masses were very much responsive to the strikes and other activities of the

    resistance called for by the movement, and upon the issuance of the movement's charter,

    the enemy started a wide campaign of arrests targeting the movement's cadres and

    followers. The biggest such campaign was launched in May 1989 in which the founding

    leader, Shaikh Ahmad Yassin, was arrested.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the development of the movement's methods of resistance which included capturing

    Zionist soldiers in the winter of 1989, and with the movement's resorting to their war of

    cold steel against the occupation troops in 1990, a large campaign of arrests was launched

    against the movement in December 1990 and the occupation authorities deported some of the

    movement's activists and leaders. It also decreed that the movement and membership was a

    crime and those caught with affiliations with the movement would receive severe

    punishment.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The movement entered a new phase with the establishment of its military wing, the

    Regiments of Martyrs Izzudin Al Qassam, in late 1991. The wing's activities against the

    Zionist soldiers and settlers steadily increased and in December 1992, the movement's

    fighters carried out the operation of capturing the soldier Nassim Tolidano after which

    the Zionist authorities launched a hectic campaign of arrests against the movement's

    cadres and followers. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ishaq Rabin ordered the deportation of

    415 activists of our people, which was a precedent for mass deportation. Hamas and Islamic

    Jihad deportees set a typical example as fighters who held strongly to their land no

    matter how heavy the cost was. Therefore, Rabin eventually agreed to their return after

    they spent one year in the open in the temporary camp of Marj el-Sahour in south Lebanon.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The deportations did not stop the operation launched by Hamas and its military wing.

    The year of 1993 witnessed a remarkable rise in the confrontations between our Palestinian

    masses and the Zionist occupation soldiers, coupled with a paralleled increase in military

    attacks against the occupation soldiers and settlers.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As popular resistance grew stronger, the enemy clamped a closure down on the West Bank

    and Gaza in an attempt to curb acts of resistance.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In February of 1994, a Jewish terrorist settler called Barraugh Goldstein, committed a

    crime against Palestinians who were praying in Al Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron when 30

    Palestinians fell martyrs and 100 others were wounded.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The size of the crime and its repercussions prompted Hamas to declare an all-out war

    against the Zionist occupation and to broaden the scope of its operations to include every

    Israeli settler on the Arab land of Palestine with the objective of halting the crimes

    against unarmed Palestinian civilians.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, Hamas stands at the front of the forces which are working against Zionist goals.

    Despite the comprehensive campaign targeting it, Hamas remains the major force which keeps

    the Palestinian cause alive and which makes the Palestinian people, the children of the

    Arab and Islamic nation and the free people all over the world feel confident that there

    is a possibility to stand up against Zionism which has been going through its golden era

    since the beginning of the 90s and to give them hope that it could be defeated and

    destroyed by God's will.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><big><a NAME="anchor223753"></a><b>The conflict with Zionism in

    Hamas ideology</b></big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Hamas movement believes that the conflict with the Zionists in Palestine is a

    conflict of survival. It is a conflict of civilization and determination that can not be

    brought to an end unless its cause-the Zionist settlement in Palestine, usurpation of its

    land, and the displacement of its people-is removed.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas sees in the Hebraic state an antagonistic totalitarian regime, not just an entity

    with territorial ambitions, a regime that complements the forces of modern colonialism

    which aim to take hold of the nation's riches and resources and to prevent the rise of any

    grouping that works to unify the nation's ranks. It seeks to achieve this objective by

    promoting provincialism, alienating the nation from its cultural roots and clamping down

    on its economic, political, military and even intellectual hegemony.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Hebraic state forms an instrument that breaks the geographic continuity of the

    central Arab countries, and it is a device to deplete the nation's resources. It is also a

    spearhead which is ready to strike at any project that aims to raise the nation up.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main confrontations with the Zionist entity is taking place in Palestine where the

    enemy has established its base and stronghold. But the threats and challenges posed by the

    Zionists run deeper and so threaten all Islamic countries. Hamas believes that the Zionist

    entity, since its inception, has constituted a threat to the Arab countries and also in

    their strategic depth, the Islamic countries. The 90s witnessed huge transformations that

    highlighted this danger which knows no limits.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas believes that the best way to handle the conflict with the Zionist enemy is to

    mobilize the potentialities of the Palestinian people in the struggle against the Zionist

    presence in Palestine and to keep the firebrand burning until the time when the conditions

    to win the battle have been realized, and wait until all the potentialities and resources

    of the Arab and Islamic nation are mobilized under a common political will and purpose.

    Until that happens and there is belief in the sanctity of the<br>

    Palestinian cause and its Islamic importance and an awareness of the ultimate goals and

    dangers of the Zionist project in Palestine, Hamas believes that no part of Palestine

    should be compromised, that the Zionist occupation of Palestine should not be recognized

    and that it is imperative for the people of Palestine, as well as all Arabs and Muslims,

    to prepare themselves to fight the Zionists until they leave Palestine the way they

    migrated to it.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><a target="main" href="#top"><font face="Times New Roman">Top</font></a></p>

    <hr>

    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><big><a NAME="anchor9356"></a><b>Military action in Hamas program</b></big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Hebraic state represents an entity which is antagonistic to all aims of Arab and

    Islamic awakening. for it is known that had it not been for the state of deterioration and

    decadence through which the nation was passing, the Zionists would not have realized their

    dream of establishing their state in Palestine.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recognizing this fact, the Zionists work against any program which they think would add

    to the Arab and Islamic capabilities. They believe that any attempts aiming at achieving

    an Arab and Islamic awakening constitute a strategic threat to Israel. The Zionists also

    believe that if Arab power was unified under a comprehensive program of awakening, it

    would pose a major threat to the Hebraic state. This conviction has prompted the Zionist

    leaders to transform their state from an alien entity in the Arab and Islamic surrounding

    to become part of it under the influence of economy. This explains why they support the

    (peace) settlement and promote projects with an economic orientation. It is within this

    context that the military action in the Hamas program should be viewed. Military action is

    the movement's strategic instrument for combating the Zionist element. In the absence of a

    comprehensive Arab and Islamic plan for liberation, military action will remain the only

    guarantee that would keep the conflict going and that would make it difficult for the

    enemy to expand outside Palestine.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In its strategic dimension, military action is the Palestinian people's main instrument

    to keep the firelog burning in Palestine and to counter Israeli schemes which aim at

    transferring the center of tension to other ports in the Arab and Islamic world.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Military action, moreover, is an instrument to defer the Zionists and to prevent them

    from threatening the security of the Palestinians. This was evident in the series of

    heroic attacks carried out by the movement in retaliation to the crime committed by the

    terrorist Baraugh Goldstein against the Palestinians who were praying in Al Ibrahimi

    Mosque.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pursuing this approach and enforcing it up would weigh heavily on the Zionists to force

    them to step up their practices against the interests of our people in the West Bank and

    Gaza Strip.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas believes that Israel's integration into the Arab and Islamic region would hamper

    every plan that seeks to uplift the nation.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Israel, which is backed by the US and its technology, aims to take advantage of the

    weakness of its adversaries in order to achieve a settlement, a plan which, in its

    essence, aims at linking the Arab economies to a new cluster with Israel at its center.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas resistance against the occupation is not directed against the Jews as followers

    of a religion, but rather against the occupation, its existence and oppressive practices.

    This resistance is not associated with the peace process in the region as alleged by the

    Hebraic state and the supporters of the current settlement. The resistance was there

    before the convening of the Madrid Conference; and the movement has no hostilities or

    battles with any international party, nor does it target the interests of the properties

    of the various countries. This is because it considers that the scene of its battle

    against the Zionist occupation is limited to the Occupied Palestinian Territories. When

    the Zionist officials threatened to transfer the battle with Hamas to areas outside the

    Occupied Territories, Hamas warned the Zionist authorities against the serious dangers of

    such a step. This testifies to the fact that Hamas does not wish to enlarge the circle of

    the conflict.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In resisting the occupation, Hamas directs its action against military targets and does

    its best to ensure that its resistance would not cause losses among civilians. It is true

    that in some cases resistance carried out by the movement resulted in some civilian

    losses, but these losses were in self-defense and came in retaliation to the massacres

    committed against innocent Palestinian civilians as was the case with the Ibrahimi Mosque

    massacre in Hebron when Palestinians were shot dead at the hands of<br>

    settlers and the soldiers of the occupation. Anxious to see no civilians on either side

    fall victim to the conflict, Hamas took several initiatives proposing that both sides stop

    targeting civilians and that they be excluded from the scope of conflict. However, the

    Zionists rejected these initiatives and by doing so they showed their terrorist nature and

    their indifference to saving innocent Palestinians from bloodshed.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In its activities of resistance, Hamas is keen on adhering to the noble teachings of

    Islam, human rights and international law. It carries out its lawful resistance not for

    the sake of murder and bloodshed as is the case with the Zionists.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><big><a NAME="anchor12760"></a><b>Hamas' position regarding the

    political settlement</b></big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas has repeatedly affirmed it is not against the principle of peace. It is for it

    and is seeking to achieve it. It agrees with all countries that peace should prevail over

    the whole world. However, only just peace will restore to the Palestinians their rights

    and enable them to exercise their rights for independence and self-determination. The

    movement holds that the accords that have been concluded fall short of meeting the

    aspirations and minimum goals of the Palestinian people. These are unfair agreements which

    cause harm to our people. They reward the aggressors for their aggression and acknowledge

    to them the right to acquire what they have wrongfully taken from others. It is a

    situation where the conditions are dictated by the triumphant and the tyrannized are

    required to give up their rights. An unjust peace of the nature does not hold for long.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The very essence of any political settlement, irrespective of its origin or content,

    entails recognition of the Zionist enemy's right to exist on most parts of Palestine,

    which deprives millions of Palestinians the right to return, to determine their future and

    build their independent state on the whole of Palestinian land. This is indeed

    contradictory to human and international values and traditions, and is also forbidden

    under the Islamic jurisprudence. This should not be allowed to happen because the land of

    Palestine is a blessed Islamic land that has been usurped by the Zionists; and Jihad has

    become a duty for Muslims to restore it and expeltheir occupiers out of their land.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In view of the above, the movement has rejected Shulz's and Baker's plan, the 10 points

    of Mubarak, Shamir's plan and the Madrid-Washington process. Hamas believes that the most

    dangerous of all settlement projects are &quot;Gaza-Jericho First&quot; that was concluded

    in Washington on September 13, 1993, between the Zionist entity and the PLO leadership;

    the mutual recognition document' and the agreements of Taba, Cairo and the likes. What is

    disastrous about these agreements is that they do not only recognize the Zionist

    sovereignty over all of Palestine, normalize Arab-Zionist relations and give the Zionists

    a free hand over the whole region, but are also endorsed by a Palestinian side even though

    this side does not represent the Palestinians in actual terms. All of this means closing

    the Palestinian case and depriving the Palestinian people from claiming their rights or

    from using legitimate means to restore them. It also consolidates the basis for depriving

    the majority of Palestinians to live on their land, to say nothing about the consequences

    that all of this may reflect on the Arab and Islamic people.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In view of the dangers posed by the settlement currently in process, the movement

    adopted a position based on the following points:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Promoting the awareness of the Palestinian people concerning the perils of the

    settlement and the accords resulting from it.<br>

    2. Working to group in one bloc all Palestinian forces opposed to the settlement and its

    accords and to promote their principles to the Palestinian, Arab and international arenas.<br>

    3. Urging the PLO leadership to withdraw from the negotiations with the Zionist entity and

    from the Gaza-Jericho deal which threatens the existence of our people in Palestine and

    the Diaspora now and in the future.<br>

    4. Making contacts with the Arab and Islamic countries with the intent to ask them to

    withdraw from the negotiations, not to respond to the conspiracy of normalizing the

    relations with the Zionist entity, and to lend us their support in confronting the Zionist

    enemy and its plans.</font></p>

    Palestinian forces</b></big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Hamas maintains that the field of the Palestinian national action is wide enough to

    accommodate all visions and orientations opposed to the Zionist plot. It believes that the

    unification of the national Palestinian action is the objective that all forces, factions

    and detachments should aim to realize.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Hamas seeks to coordinate and cooperate with all operating forces and factions out

    of its belief that common denominators and points of agreement should prevail over points

    of disagreement.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Hamas seeks to reinforce the joint national action, and believes that the framework

    for such an action should rest on a commitment to work for the liberation of Palestine and

    to refuse to recognize the Zionist enemy or to give it the right to exist on any part of

    Palestine.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Hamas holds that no matter how far apart the point of view may be in the arena of

    patriotic action, no party should resort to violence or arms to settle differences or to

    dictate opinions and persuasions inside the Palestinian camp.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Hamas undertakes advocacy for the cause of the Palestinian people without

    discrimination between religious, ethnic groups or sects. It believes in the right of all

    groups and sects of the Palestinians to defend their territories and defend their

    homeland. It also believes that the Palestinians are one people, whether Muslim or

    Christian.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><strong><big><a NAME="anchor23583"></a>Hamas' position towards

    the Self-Rule Authority</big></strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas believes that the &quot;Self-rule Authority&quot; is an outcome of the agreements

    of the co-existence with the Zionist enemy. It holds that the Zionists have agreed to the

    establishment of this authority to achieve a number of short and long-term objectives.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Authority, which is supported by 30,000 armed men forming a police force that holds

    different titles, is committed to implementing the obligations provided for in the

    agreements. At the top of these obligations is to confront resistance operations and to

    strike the resistance factions under the pretext of protecting the settlement process and

    the Authority's agreement with Israel.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being hostage to the Oslo Agreements, the Authority serves as a legal cover for the

    occupation and its practices. Merely by the way of an example, when the Authority approved

    the opening of by-passes for the settlers, it gave the Zionist settlements a legal status.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas maintains that the Zionists have avoided confronting the movement and its Jihadi

    program by hiding behind the Self-Rule Authority. The movement is also aware that if it

    entered into a military confrontation with the Self-Rule Authority, it would achieve one

    of the Zionist's greatest objectives and ambitions. Out of this awareness, Hamas did not

    allow itself to be dragged into a dispute with the Authority despite the Authority's

    repressive practices and its human rights violations in the Self-Rule areas, which

    included the assassination of Mujahideen, opening fire on citizens while praying, rounding

    up hundreds of Palestinians on the charges of supporting the resistance factions and

    torturing prisoners to death.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hamas considers the Oslo Accords as an alluding formula for liquidating the Palestinian

    cause and for protecting the Zionists at the expense of the rights of the Palestinian

    people. It remains opposed to these accords and seeks to abort them by means of the

    popular resistance without resorting to violence against the Authority and its symbols.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The movement is confident that the Authority and its political project are doomed to

    fail under the impact of the security aspect of the Oslo Accords.</font></p>

    steadfastness of the Palestinian people.</font></p>

    public about the inhuman practices of the Zionist occupation against the Palestine people.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Hamas does not seek enmity with anyone on the basis of religious convictions or

    opinion pressurizing the Zionist entity to end its occupation of our land and holy
