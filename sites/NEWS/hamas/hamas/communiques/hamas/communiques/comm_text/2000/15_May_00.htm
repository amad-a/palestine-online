      </h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Twelve years in Jail was part of the price that a Mujahid like Sheikh
      Salah Shehade had paid in sacrifice for his country and cause. Twelve
      years of struggle along with his colleagues the other detainees in
      occupation prisons, recording shining pages of heroism and sacrifice for
      the sake of our land, cause and sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Zionist Occupation authority has refused to set free the Mujahid
      Salah Shehade despite the fact that his prison sentence had expired. It
      renewed his arrest for more than two years in a way exposing arrogance of
      occupation, which does not accord any weight to right, and whose entity is
      founded on aggression, oppression and wrong for 52 years.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Brother Salah Shehade, along with his brothers the Mujahideen in the
      military wing of Hamas, represented the symbol of Jihad and resistance for
      our people and Ummah. They represented a symbol of patience and
      steadfastness, a model in challenging jailers. The operations, which he
      launched along with his brothers, posed as our people's hope for victory
      and liberation. His steadfastness in jail was a model of pride and dignity
      through which he affirmed that the Qassam heroes never bargain over their
      country, sanctities or dignity of their people and that they sacrifice
      their souls for the cause of Allah in their battle against occupation.
      They drew to other detainees the image of a patient believer.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We, in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirm that releasing all
      heroic detainees will remain our and our people's permanent goal and
      that we will not rest until the last prisoner of our people is set free.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The coincidental release of Mujahid Salah Shehade with the popular
      confrontations, the solidarity campaigns with our detainees and resisting
      occupation soldiers and settler herds strongly affirm that rights are
      grabbed. It also underscores that releasing heroic detainees is only
      possible through pressuring the occupation authority and escalating
      confrontations against it rather than begging (for rights) at the
      negotiating table.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We regret that the release of Sheikh Salah Shehade fell at a time when
      the Palestinian Authority is pursuing and arresting Mujahideen in service
      of Zionist occupation.<b><o:p>
