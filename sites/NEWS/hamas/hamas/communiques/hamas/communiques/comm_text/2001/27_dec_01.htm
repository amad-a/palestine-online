      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Statement
      on Peres-Qrei negotiations<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="font-size:11.5pt">And
      the continuous Zionist aggression on our people<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">There
      are two important developments in the Palestinian arena these days first
      the recent declaration of a secret negotiations channel between Shimon
      Peres and Ahmed Qrei. The Palestinian Authority later added Yasser Abed
      Rabbo to its negotiating team, adopted the talks and officially endorsed
      them despite their meager and serious content. The discussions focus on
      establishing a mini (Palestinian) state on 42% of the West Bank and Gaza
      Strip lands, which is the same area the PA is currently controlling, in
      return for halting the intifada and resistance. The negotiations further
      envisage postponing final status talks on major issues to a later stage
      between the Palestinian state and the Zionist entity, which point to the
      dangerous destiny awaiting future of our cause and our people's rights
      under such negotiations and accompanying policies. Those negotiations
      further endanger future and fate of Al-Quds, right of return, borders of
      the state while ignoring future of Jewish settlements!<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The
      second development is the continuation of Zionist aggression on our people
      despite Yasser Arafat's address on the eve of the Eid, which came to
      meet �Israeli� and American demands. The Zionist enemy shelled Rafah
      in the past three days and stormed Tamun, Azun, Jenin, Khalil and Shuweika
      (near Tulkarm). The shelling was accompanied by murders, abductions,
      detentions and destruction of houses. Those developments are ongoing
      amidst PA's insistence not to retaliate regardless of Sharon's
      practices. The PA is also insisting on comprehensive calm and ceasefire at
      the pretext of stripping Sharon of any excuses and exposing his intentions
      before America and the world as if Sharon was in need of any excuses to go
      ahead with his aggression or in need of more testing or experimenting!<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Those
      grave developments reveal the PA's real intentions namely to extricate
      itself from the intifada and resistance situation and proceed to the
      negotiations on whatever basis available even if it was contrary to our
      people's aspirations and to the new political ceiling reached thanks to
      the intifada and resistance and their great accomplishments over the past
      15 months.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">It
      is true that the PA was subject to huge pressures and threats by Sharon
      and the Americans but such pressures do not justify gambling our
      people's rights and future of the Palestine cause in return for PA's
      safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The well being of the
      country and Al-Quds is above the safety of individuals or leaderships.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">In
      the light of such circumstances and serious developments, we in the
      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, would like to affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">1-
      we refuse any concessions or an end to the intifada and resistance
      program. We insist on the importance of sticking to both and progressing
      in them in their capacity as our people's genuine option in rebelling
      the aggression, ensuring self-defense and accomplishing rights and goals.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">2-
      we condemn the return to the negotiating channels and security meetings
      with the Zionist enemy. Our people's rights, national unity and intifada
      are the victims at those meetings and negotiations. Our people and their
      Mujahid factions strongly reject any solution that would prune Palestinian
      rights in lands, Quds and holy shrines.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">3-
      we call on our Palestinian people� masses and national and Islamic
      factions to boost national unity and escalate intifada and resistance
      against occupation. We call on them to pressure the PA to revoke its
      measures concerning the arrests and closures of scores of our people's
      national institutions that always assisted them in their steadfastness
      vis-&agrave;-vis Zionist siege, starvation and aggression.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">In conclusion, we
      affirm to our people and Ummah's masses that the Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, along with all struggling and Mujahid forces would remain
      God willing the protecting shield of our people and would remain insisting
      on our people's rights and goals and would continue resisting occupation
      until it leaves our holy land Insha�allah.<o:p>
