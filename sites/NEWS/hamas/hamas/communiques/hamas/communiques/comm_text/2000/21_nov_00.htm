      the growing Zionist offensive against our heroic people and criminal Barak
      unveils a new criminal plan to quell the blessed intifada and at the time
      when savage shelling with planes and navy vessels targets our stationed
      people in Gaza Strip, our people display more determination to confront
      such barbaric attacks. Such aggressions would not deter our people from
      continuing their intifada and struggle regardless of sacrifice and from
      going ahead with strikes and daring operations against occupation wherever
      it was. Here they are the people�s Islamic and national forces decide to
      persist in the holy Aqsa intifada and not to accept any other alternative
      to freedom and independence after defeating occupation and ending its
      presence on our blessed Palestinian land. Thousand salutations to the
      hands that grabbed triggers and directed bullets at the criminal
      occupiers. Greetings to the stone throwers, to the patient mothers of
      martyrs and their relatives, to the wounded, to the brave detainees behind
      bars and their patient families, to the workers, merchants and farmers, to
      each and every child, aged, woman and young man of our stationed people.</p>

      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">We, in the
      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, have vowed not to accept any
      alternative to that of resistance until our people�s aspirations in
      freedom, defeating occupation and ending its presence in our holy lands
      are actualized. We are convinced in Allah�s victory to our people
      despite all attempts to foil their heroic intifada. Our Palestinian people
      have known the way and hoisted the gun, which no one could ever break or
      quell its fire. No one could confiscate stones of our revolting children
      in face of Zionist occupiers. This is our people�s option after the fake
      peace was exposed and dropped once and for all, God willing. Our people
      have affirmed their cohesion and unity in support of the resistance option
      until victory is achieved and occupation is flushed out.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Our
      stationed Palestinian people � our Arab and Islamic Nation:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">To achieve
      our hopes in defeating occupation, liberation and return, the Islamic
      Resistance Movement would like to affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>First: on
      the Palestinian level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1- Hamas
      calls on our Palestinian people to holy Aqsa intifada to cope with the new
      challenges imposed by the arrogant occupier. We urge them to improvise new
      painful blows to the enemy that would spread panic in lines of its
      soldiers and settlers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2- Hamas
      requests our people not to heed calls for calming the blessed intifada or
      even insinuating such an inclination. We also ask them to strongly resist
      rumors trying to weaken, besmear or divert the intifada from its course.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3- The Hamas
      Movement hails the martyr hero Baha�uldin Sa�eed from the Maghazi
      refugee camp who launched the heroic operation in the Kfar Darum
      settlement, which led to the death of two soldiers and the injury of
      others. We also salute those who planned the bus explosion yesterday.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">4- Hamas asks
      the heroic Palestinian people to display more solidarity and cooperation.
      The Movement renews calls for forming popular committees that would look
      after people�s needs and calls for adapting to that distinctive Jihad
      atmosphere.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">5- The
      Movement affirms the importance of boycotting all Zionist and American
      goods and resorting instead to national products.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">6- Hamas
      greets the worshippers in the streets of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and around
      its walls, who are prevented by occupation authorities from offering
      prayers in the holy Aqsa Mosque and who affirm Islamism and Arabism of Al-Quds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">7- We urge
      our generous merchants and cherished doctors to support our people who are
      besieged in the old quarters of Al-Khaleel (Hebron) and who are living
      under siege and curfew for the past 40 days.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Second: on
      the Arab-Islamic level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1- The
      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, hails the Islamic resistance heroes in
      Hizbullah who have launched the heroic Aqsa martyrs operation in the
      occupied Lebanese area of Shibaa and condemns UN secretary general�s
      biased statements in favor of the Zionist enemy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2- Hamas
      calls on our Arab and Islamic masses to escalate activities in support of
      the holy Aqsa intifada and in support of the Palestinian people�s Jihad
      through organizing demonstrations, marches, rallies, sit-ins, conferences
      and panels in backing or our people and rights.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3- Hamas
      appreciates calls by leaders, Ulama (Islamic scholars) and supporters of
      Islamic Movements along with all national and nationalist forces in the
      Arab and Islamic arenas for ending all forms of normalization with the
      usurping Zionist enemy and for boycotting Zionist and American goods. We
      also ask them to form anti-normalization committees and other committees
      in support of the intifada.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">4- Hamas
      demands the immediate interference of the international community and
      human rights institutions to break the siege and lift the curfew imposed
      on Al-Khaleel for more than 40 days.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Third: the
      activities:<o:p>

      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1- The
      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirms the importance of abiding by
      activities called for by all Islamic and national committee in all
      districts of the country.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2- Hamas
      urges our Mujahid Palestinian people to turn the grounds into burning
      fires under the feet of the occupiers especially on Friday.</p>

      holy month of Ramadan is approaching � the month of Quran, the month of
      Jihad, victory, patience and repentance, we call on them to get closer to
      Allah through the Ta�at (obeying His orders), fasting and asking for His
