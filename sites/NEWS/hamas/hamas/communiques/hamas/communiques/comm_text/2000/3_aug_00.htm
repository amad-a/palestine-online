      Authority chief Yasser Arafat's statements to the Yemeni News Agency
      'saba� and the Yemeni television last Sunday 30 July in which he said,
      �<u>As for the Israelis they have the Wailing Wall (Buraq Wall) and we
      respect that Wall and allow them to pray at it � but otherwise we never
      allow any tampering with Islamic or Christian holy shrines.</u>� � a
      responsible source in the Hamas Movement said:</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;</b><o:p>

      <p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">The serious
      statements delivered by chairman of the PA on an alleged right for the
      Jews in the Buraq Wall point to what took place in the Camp David summit
      and indicate that big concessions were made by the Palestinian party on
      our Islamic holy shrines in Al-Quds (Jerusalem) topped by the Buraq Wall,
      as indicated in Arafat's statements. Such a development is a serious
      precedence that affects each and every Muslim on our planet and
      necessitates a decisive stance.</font></p>
      <p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">The Wall named by
      Arafat as the Wailing Wall, which is the Jewish name, is in fact the Buraq
      Wall that was given that name after the Buraq of prophet Mohammed, peace
      be upon him, that which was fastened to the Wall on the night of the Isra�.
      In Muslim creed it is part and parcel of the holy Aqsa Mosque and enjoys a
      great and sacred status with all Muslims in the east and west. For
      preserving its sanctity much blood were shed across history. It is really
      a painful coincidence that Arafat's statements had coincided with the
      anniversary of the Buraq revolution that swept Palestine in August 1929
      and led to the martyrdom of 120 Palestinians and the injury of 232 others
      in addition to the death of 133 Zionists and the wounding of 339 others
      and which was followed by the execution of the three famous Mujahideen the
      martyrs Fuad Hijazi, Ata Al-Zeer and Mohammed Jamjoom.</font></p>
      <p dir="LTR" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%;
direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">It is regrettable
      that such statements be voiced by head of the PA ignoring the Muslims�
      right in the Buraq Wall, a right that was granted to them by the
      international committee formed by the League of Nations in 1930, which
      endorsed the Muslims� right in the Buraq Wall and issued a report that
      included: �The Muslims alone have the ownership of the western wall and
      they alone have the right of property because it constitutes an integrated
      part of Al-Haram Al-Sharif's yard, which in turn is a part of the Waqf
      property. Muslims also own the pavement in front of the Wall at the suburb
      known as Bab Al-Maghareba (which was razed to the ground by the Zionists
      after their occupation of eastern Jerusalem in 1967) since it is a Waqf
      land revenues of which go to charity according to Islamic Sharia. The
      Jewish attempt to install any worship tools or others whether according to
      that resolution or based on approval of both parties should not mean,
      under any circumstances, the founding of a property right for the Jews in
      the Wall or the pavement near to it.�</font></p>

text-indent:9.05pt;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><font face="Times New Roman">We
      call on the Arab and Islamic Nation to move quickly and seriously to check
      the feverish Zionist attempts aimed at judaizing Al-Quds and sacrilege the
      Aqsa through the PA's capitulation. We, in the Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, affirm anew that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf
      land for all Islamic generations until the Day of Judgment. It is
      religiously prohibited to give it up partially or wholly not by any King
      or president or all kings and presidents, not by any organization or all
      organizations whether Palestinian or Arab.</font></p>
