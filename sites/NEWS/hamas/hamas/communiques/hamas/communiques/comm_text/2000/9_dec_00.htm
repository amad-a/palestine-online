      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, announces the martyrdom of Hamdy
      Arafat Ansyo commander of the Teyba operation and marine Rafah martyrdom
      operation</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Martyrs fall
      one after the other and their blessed heroism mix together to form our
      Palestinian Muslim people�s lives that are featured with Jihad,
      resistance, martyrdom and blood of heroic Mujahideen who are making glory
      of that Nation. They write its history with their pure blood and souls
      that are yearning to live in craws of the green birds that fly everywhere
      in paradise.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Today the
      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, carries the glad tidings to our
      Mujahid Palestinian people and to our Arab and Islamic Nation on the
      martyrdom of one of the heroic Mujahideen who died in a heroic martyrdom
      operation, the first of its kind in history of the blessed intifada namely
      that of Rafah. The marine operation took place one month after outbreak of
      the intifada and targeted one of the naval vessels of the Zionist enemy
      off the coasts of Rafah. The enemy hid its losses after the heroic
      martyr�s remains blasted in one of its vessels and his blood mixed with
      the roaring Palestine sea.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">One of the
      Qassam Brigades� Mujahideen, who did not wish to disclose his name, told
      the Hamas Movement�s office over the telephone, that the Mujahid Hamdy
      Arafat Ansyo, another Qassam member, was the one who launched the
      martyrdom operation off Rafah coasts against the Zionist enemy. He wished
      to meet his fate as a martyr in a qualitative operation to revenge martyrs
      of the Aqsa intifada and in retaliation to Zionist terrorism that
      escalated through missile and artillery bombardment of our steadfast and
      stationed people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The Qassam
      martyr continued his blessed Jihad after taking part in the famous Teyba
      operation in March 2000 during which he penetrated, along with his
      brothers the Mujahideen, all barricades to strike deep into the enemy�s
      lines. In that operation four Mujahideen were martyred namely Na�el Abu
      Awwad, Ammar Hassanein, Anwar Al-Bura�ee and Ihab Al-Hattab.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font color="#0000FF">Our
      Mujahid people:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The Islamic
      Resistance Movement, Hamas, while bearing the glad tidings to our people
      and Nation along with news of famous operations launched along the march
      of the blessed intifada, it would like to affirm on the option of
      resistance and Jihad until liberty and dignity are achieved for our people
      and Nation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">This brave
      martyr, who loved Jihad and martyrdom, had his fingers cut off in the
      previous intifada in an explosion operation. However, he continued the
      march of Jihad launching the heroic Teyba operation then he was martyred
      in a qualitative operation that the enemy never before experienced. May
      Allah have mercy on his soul and rest his soul in peace alongside the
      prophets and martyrs.</p>
