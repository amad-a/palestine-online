      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The latest meeting between the chairman of the
      Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat, and the Prime Minister of the Zionist
      entity, Ehud Barak, that Took place last Thursday confirms once again the
      pointlessness of the negotiations on what is called the Palestinian track,
      and shows up the weakness<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span> <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">afflicting the Palestinian negotiators.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman">Once again Barak is imposing
      his conditions and dictates on the Palestinian Authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Barak has decreed redeployment of occupation troops from an area of
      6.1% of the West Bank, an area that he has delineated unilaterally. He has
      refused to include the suburbs of al-Ayzariyah and Abu Dis, near
      Jerusalem, in the redeployment area. These are the regions that the
      Palestinian Authority has demanded so that it can declare them a capital
      of an imaginary Palestinian state, in return for the PA's submission to
      abandon Jerusalem to remain under Zionist sovereignty, and a capital of
      the occupation state.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman">The Palestinian Authority
      has rejected the maps of areas of redeployment drawn up by the Zionists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It has become customary, however, for the PA to eventually accept
      the things that it has been rejecting. Its initial rejection and display
      of firmness are always followed by a breakdown and submission to what the
      Zionist enemy dictates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      is precisely what happened with the last redeployment that included 5% of
      the West Bank - an arrangement that was at first rejected, but later, it
      was accepted.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman">We have said repeatedly that
      the Palestinian Authority goes to the negotiations psychologically
      defeated and feeble, with no source of strength and unable to apply
      pressure after having given up its sources of strength and isolated itself
      from our people. It has lorded it over their heads, resorted to all sorts
      of repression, deprived them of their freedoms and rights, tracked down
      those who carry on the struggle, opened the prisons and detention centres
      to honourable citizens and members of the opposition, and shredded
      national unity. For that reason our people pin none of their hopes upon
      this Authority. They<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>also
      expect nothing from such an Authority but more squandering of their rights
      and the holy places.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman">The resolution of the PLO's
      Central Council, issued at its latest meeting a few days ago, came in line
      with the Authority's approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Declaring
      a state has become a tactical matter for the Authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Many times it has hinted that it was planning such an announcement,
      only to submit in the end and accept the Zionist and American orders and
      conditions. The United States and the Zionists want to see the declaration
      of a Palestinian state postponed until after the conclusion of the final
      status talks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That way the declaration of a state would come as a cheap
      reward for liquidating the Palestinian cause and all critical issues, in
      exchange for a state in name only that conforms to Zionist conditions,
      that has been stripped of sovereignty, will, and honour.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman">Such a freakish state has
      been and always will be acceptable to the Zionist leaders because they
      consider it to be entirely in the interest of their usurping entity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>What our people want is not a declaration of just any kind of
      state.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They want to build a real state that enjoys the basic
      components of a state on the ground, that exercises its own sovereignty
      and will on the liberated Palestinian land.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Times New Roman">Our people and our nation
      know that our rights and our land cannot be regained<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>by begging the Zionist enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They can only be seized back from that enemy through the
      steadfastness of our people, through the escalation of their heroic
      resistance, and through the solidarity of the Arab and Islamic peoples
      with them, supporting their steadfastness and struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The defeat of the enemy forces and puppet militias allied with them
      in south Lebanon confirms that only resistance can compel this enemy to
      submit.<o:p>
