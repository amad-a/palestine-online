      leadership of the PLO marketed the inauspicious Oslo accords as a victory
      and an achievement, slating it as a vehicle by which Statehood, freedom,
      independence, well-being, prosperity, security and stability could be
      reached and as a peace agreement to be celebrated in the White House.<o:p>

      our people are experiencing economic hardship; loose security; a proposed
      State with sovereignty over only 18% of the West Bank; the
      redeployment�not the withdrawal�of Occupation troops; and dependence
      on their occupier for their security, politics and economics. They are
      also at the mercy of the direct negotiations between Arafat and Barak,
      which are in accordance with the Zionist vision in which the Zionist
      regime dictates its perspectives regarding the final status.<o:p>

      survival of the Oslo accords, and a swindling, arrogant Zionist Prime
      Minister who imposes his conditions on the other two.<o:p>

      resistant people by the self-rule Authority and the occupation
      authorities; continued Judaization of Jerusalem; repeated denials of the
      rights of our refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes and
      to pursue self-determination; concerted efforts made to suppress our
      people�s right of Jihad and resistance by hunting down our Mujahideen in
      cooperation and coordination among the security bodies of the self rule
      authority, the occupation authorities, the CIA and others; and a rushing
      by some States in the region towards the building of relations and
      normalization of ties with the Zionist Enemy hoping to get financial
      assistance from the United States while at the same time fearing its
      threats.<o:p>

      anniversary of the inauspicious Balfour Declaration, which promised the
      Jews a homeland in Palestine. If �Balfour� was the promise, the Oslo
      agreement would be the real translation of this promise into the practical
      means necessary for the Zionist regime to procure a legitimacy which is
      not accepted by our Nation.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">While we are reminded that the Zionist gangs succeeded,
      through their military attacks, to make the Balfour Declaration a reality
      and an entity, we would like to emphasize that resistance and Jihad are
      the only ways to break this promise and to destroy this entity. They are
      also the only ways to liberate our land and build our State. We also call
      upon the Palestinian Authority to stop the series of relinquishments it
      had started, to reconsider this approach (which brought disaster to our
      Cause), and to return to its people and nation to make use of their will
      of steadfastness. It should, through this bitter experience, recognize
      that the Zionist Enemy does not seek or want peace, that its
      expansionistic settlement project will not stop, and that the U.S.
      Administration is a full partner and colluder working only for the
      interests of the Zionist Enemy.<o:p>
