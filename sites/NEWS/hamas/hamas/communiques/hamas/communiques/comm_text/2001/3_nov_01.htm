      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><b>Statement on the American
      offensive against the Islamic Resistance Movement, putting it on the list
      of terrorist organizations and considering the Palestinian intifada as
      terrorism that should be combated</b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Ever since the Zionist
      occupation of our Palestinian lands the USA displayed hostility against
      the Palestinian people, their resistance of occupation and their
      aspirations for freedom. The USA also displayed absolute bias in favor of
      the Zionist entity and covered up for its terrorist practices against our
      people including the use of veto to block any resolution that would
      condemn such practices.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">And here again the USA is
      declaring anew its obvious tilt through declaring resistance movements in
      Palestine, including the Islamic Resistance Movement � Hamas, as
      terrorist organizations.<span dir="RTL" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Traditional Arabic&quot;"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
      decision meant that the USA would adopt against them a number of
      procedures not only denying them entry to that country but also arresting
      all those supporting and sympathizing with those organizations, trying
      them and deporting them. The USA considers our people's resistance and
      glorious intifada as terrorism that must be combated.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, believes that the American declaration at this particular
      time reflected the USA's total and unlimited backing to the usurping
      Zionist entity that is practicing the cruelest forms of terrorism. The
      decision further provides legitimate cover for all Zionist practices
      against our people. Hamas would like to assert here that it never viewed
      America as a friendly or a just country for it is the one supplying the
      Zionist enemy with all tools of murder and destruction of our people. The
      USA is also keen on maintaining the Zionist entity the strongest military
      power in the region and assists that entity with the use of veto along
      with financial backing and moral support.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, considers both America and the Zionist entity as two
      terrorist states that practice international terrorism against the Muslim
      peoples of Afghanistan and Palestine.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Such a bleak image of the
      American administration and the Zionist entity gives us additional
      momentum to persist along the road of Jihad and resistance depending first
      and foremost on almighty Allah then on the determination and steadfastness
      of our people and our Arab and Islamic Nation. We will persevere along
      that road until we attain our legitimate and full rights and until we free
      our lands from the usurping occupation, which has no future in the region
      and which will be ultimately defeated Insha�allah.</p>
