&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Our steadfast people � our people everywhere �<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We remember today the 53<sup>rd</sup> anniversary
      of the usurpation of Palestine at the hands of Zionist gangs with the full
      and direct support of the then British occupation. Those gangs practiced
      the most brutal massacres against our people to force their immigration
      out of their lands and property.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The anniversary this year falls at a time when our
      people are living through a saga of heroism and sacrifice in face of the
      Zionist enemy's tyranny. Thus they confirm that more than half a century
      of occupation and repression would not terminate that people's Jihad,
      resistance and steadfastness. On the contrary, they affirm their
      insistence on the right of liberating all usurped lands, Al-Quds
      (Jerusalem) and holy shrines from Zionist occupation. The anniversary
      further falls at a time when Sharon's savage aggression against our
      people is escalating daily in an all-out offensive. The latest such attack
      was the barbaric aerial and sea shelling of the Gaza Strip last night
      other than the cowardly assassination of five Palestinian policemen
      earlier yesterday near Ramallah. The savage onslaught also includes the
      bombardment and explosions in various cities, villages and refugee camps
      and the killing of innocent children and assassinating intifada and
      resistance cadres in a feverish attempt on the part of Sharon to break our
      people's steadfastness and resistance in preparation for imposing his
      conditions.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>In the light of this continuous Zionist
      escalation, We affirm to our steadfast Mujahid people the following:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">1- Failure of the peace settlement process and
      program in the light of the bitter experience. It has been proven beyond
      reasonable doubt that the enemy does not respect any pledges or
      agreements. It has been proven that there is no use from any contacts or
      meetings with that enemy for it only understood the language of force and
      resistance. Hence, all forces in the Palestinian arena, that are daily
      attacked and murdered, are called upon to decide their options immediately
      and stick to the resistance program. They should support and develop
      resistance means with all potentials without heeding any other
      alternatives or initiatives.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">2- Importance of preserving national unity, which
      was achieved by the grace of Allah and was strengthened in the field along
      the road of intifada and resistance. We should boost, protect and insist
      on the intifada in its capacity as our effective tool in this ferocious
      battle against the enemy. Here we bless the efforts of factions and forces
      and we bless this great steadfastness, patience and sacrifice of our
      people in the occupied homeland. We also bless activity of our people in
      the diaspora calling on them to reflect more such interaction.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">3- Despite the big losses in the ranks of our
      people, yet the party that is really cornered is Sharon, his terrorist
      government and the Zionist society in general. This is reflected in the
      enemy soldiers, settlers and street's low moral as a result of their
      casualties and loss of security and stability and their growing feeling of
      concern over the present and future of the Zionist entity despite the
      elapse of more than half a century over their usurpation of Palestine.
      Consequently, we call on our Mujahid people and struggling forces to be
      more patient and steadfast over the resistance program for victory is ours
      and defeat will befall our enemies, which will not be far off
      Insha�allah. <b><i>�O ye who believe! persevere in patience and
      constancy; vie in such perseverance; strengthen each other; and fear
      Allah; that ye may prosper�</i></b> . <b><i>�if ye are suffering
      hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have hope from
      Allah, while they have none.�<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </i></b></span></p>
      <p><b>Our Arab and Islamic Nation �</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">It goes without saying that the Zionist usurpation
      of Palestine did not target the Palestinian people only but rather the
      whole Nation. Hence and as long as Palestine and its holy places are of
      concern to the whole Nation, based on religious duty and national
      responsibility, � why is this suspicious silence? Why does the Nation
      leave its people in Palestine face the Zionist carnage and shoulder
      burdens of the battle alone?<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>In the light of the aforementioned we urge the
      Arab and Islamic governments and peoples to do the following:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">1- Sense the importance of shouldering their
      responsibility regarding the grave events taking place on the land of
      Palestine and present to our people all forms of political, financial and
      popular backing in addition to arms and equipment on the basis of
      participating in the battle in its capacity as the whole Nation's
      battle. There is no room here for neutrality, mediation, silence or wait
      and see!!<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We praise, in this regard, the Arab and Islamic
      masses that renewed their interaction with our people's intifada and
      request more such action. We call on the rest of the Nation's masses to
      urgently follow their suit.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">2- The Nation has to realize that the era of
      defeat, which we suffered in the past, has ended with the grace of Allah.
      The Zionists could no longer dictate on us whatever they wish. The
      Zionists� defeat in Palestine is practically possible. Their defeat in
      South Lebanon, the first anniversary of which passes these days, at the
      hands of the Islamic resistance is a living example. Our people's
      intifada, resistance and great sacrifices furnish the atmosphere and allow
      the opportunity before our Nation today to register a new victory, God
      willing, against this usurping entity.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p><b>Our Arab and Islamic peoples �</b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">We are standing these days at an important
      crossing point in our history and before a big responsibility in
      confrontation with the Zionist project that necessitate uniting the ranks,
      shouldering the burden of Jihad and resistance and mobilizing potentials
      requesting first and foremost the help of almighty Allah.</p>
