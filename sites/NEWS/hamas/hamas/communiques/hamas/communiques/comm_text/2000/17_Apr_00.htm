      Jihad and martyrdom operations and protectors of the sanctities in
      Al-Quds, Khalil (Hebron), Nablus and Gaza in addition to all cities,
      villages and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They are the

      most precious things owned by peoples and countries are the human being,
      land and sanctities. Countries, which respect themselves, and living
      peoples, are those who preserve the human being's life and dignity as
      well as defending their lands, doctrines and holy shrines offering in the
      process the most precious sacrifices. It is not correct at all, especially
      in our Palestinian matter, to surrender our Palestinian human being's
      right, freedom and dignity or to fall short towards our principles and
      sanctities or preoccupy ourselves away from liberating our lands from
      occupation for the sake of alternate partial gains and decorative rituals.<o:p>

      prisoner's day is an opportunity to pursue a serious policy in support
      of our heroic prisoners behind bars, back their rights and stand by their
      families. We should amend the present situation and re-arrange our
      priorities to be topped by liberating prisoners and lands and stick to our
      right to Al-Quds not accepting any alternative to it. We should also stick
      to our religion, values, principles, and national prerogatives and insist
      on the refugees� right to return to their homeland.</font></p>

      prisoner's day urges us to back the detainees in both the enemy jails
      and those of the Palestinian Authority, which should immediately release
      all Mujhadeen and detainees if it was serious in reviving that day. It is
      an outright contradiction to call on the enemy to release Palestinian
      detainees while your jails are crowded with renowned cadres, Mujahideen
      and freedom fighters.!! We furthermore warn you against deceiving our
      prisoners and people by asking for the release of some of them in return
      for relinquishing great portion of our people's rights in their lands
      and pride through your meager negotiations with our enemy.</font></p>

      refugee camps so go ahead with your efforts and double them, for the
      freedom of those detainees and their just demands is not their cause alone

      even if they committed crimes against the country they live in and carry
      its nationality. Here they are now mobilizing the whole world for the sake
      of the 13 Jews accused of spying in Iran, so why do we belittle our own
      sons? Why should we be less than other nations? Our Ummah that was known
      for supporting the weak and the oppressed, regardless of his religion and
      sent an army for the sake of a woman who called on Mo�tassem in Amoriya
      to save her, should rather be the spearhead in saving its sons the
      Mujahideen in Palestine who defend Al-Quds and its surroundings, those who
      resist the Zionist enemy that targets the whole Ummah and poses a serious
