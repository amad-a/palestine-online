      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Mujahid Mahmoud Abu Hannoud, one of the commanders of the Qassam Brigades,
      has indulged in a heroic battle in the brave village of Aseera Shamaliya
      of Nablus, against a terrorist special unit grouping hundreds of Zionist
      enemy soldiers backed by five helicopter gun ships and armored vehicles.
      He was able, all praises to Allah, to kill three enemy soldiers and wound
      nine others, one of whom sustained serious injuries.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The occupation army�s suspicious moves started at 9.50 pm Saturday a
      few meters away from Abu Hannoud housing complex owned by brother of the
      wanted Mujhaid Abu Hannoud. Close to that complex there was a house of one
      of his relatives named Nidhal Daghles Abu Yassin where the occupation
      authority expected the Mujhaid to be there. The enemy soldiers and snipers
      occupied surrounding houses and stationed in sensitive spots along with
      rooftops to tighten their siege.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">During that siege and build up the Mujahid Abu Hannoud was not inside the
      house but rather in its vicinity where he surprised the enemy by opening
      his machinegun fire at the panicked soldiers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The occupation troops wounded owner of the house Nidhal Daghles in the
      chest and feet and he could not get out of the house due to his severe
      injuries. Two hours later the enemy soldiers stormed the house and dragged
      Daghles out of it for more than 50 meters. They started torturing him,
      beating his wounds, to force him provide information on the Mujahid Abu
      Hannoud.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The night of northern Osaira turned into daylight due to the abundant use
      of flare bombs fired into its skies that were seen by all those in the
      Nablus vicinity. Shooting and clashes continued until a late hour.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">During that military siege and confrontations between Mujahid Abu Hannoud
      and the enemy soldiers calls of Allahu Akbar and there is no God but Allah
      were voiced from the Mosques� loudspeakers along with calls on the
      inhabitants to break the curfew, which the enemy tried to impose on the
      village. Calls were also voiced for backing the Mujahid Abu Hannoud in a
      bid to break the siege against him. Men, women, young and old, rushed to
      the rescue and clashed with the enemy�s confused soldiers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Enemy soldiers arrested five citizens including Imam of the village�s
      main mosque Sheikh Dhirar Hamadne, 39, who was one of the deportees to
      Marj Al-Zuhour in South Lebanon eight years ago along with the wounded man
      Nidhal Daghles and each of Ahmed Khalil, Shaher, Taher and Taiseer
      Abdullah Odeh.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Mujahid Mahmoud Abu Hannoud was able to flee from the occupation army�s
      siege thanks to Allah and reach Nablus despite the injuries in his
      shoulder, arm and back and the enemy�s chase. In Nablus, Palestinian
      Authority�s security men arrested him and he is still in their custody.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The PA�s preventive security apparatus had intensified its efforts in
      the past few months in search of Mujahid Mahmoud Abu Hannoud and arrested
      all those believed to have any connections with him. They were pressured
      into providing any information that could lead to his arrest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Our Palestinian people � our Arab and Islamic Nation:<br>
      </b>We, in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in the light of that
      unbalanced heroic battle, which led to the killing of enemy soldiers and
      lowering their morals, affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The failure of more than 300 Zionist armed-to-the-teeth soldiers along
      with their choppers, reconnaissance planes and advanced hardware in
      arresting the brave hero Mahmoud Abu Hannoud and the killing of three
      soldiers and the injury of many others proved the fragility of the theory
      of the so-called �myth of the invincible Zionist army�. The incidents
      also proved that the resistance option was still capable of inflicting
      heavy losses in lines of that army and defend the Palestinian people�s
      rights.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The military confrontation that took place in Aseera Shamaliya, in which
      a Qassam Brigade hero stood fast against the Zionist army, boosted our
      conviction and our people�s confidence that when the will of confronting
      the occupation was coupled with unshaken belief in our creed and
      principles then we could defeat the Zionist occupation and force its
      withdrawal from our occupied lands by the grace of Allah.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This is the lesson that should be well absorbed in this sensitive stage
      of our cause in the light of the successful experience of the brave
      resistance in Lebanon, especially after the failure of the settlement
      option in restoring our rights and lands from the enemy in addition to the
      humiliating conditions attached to that settlement as evident in the
      results of the latest Camp David summit.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The occupation troops� savage and barbaric aggression against Aseera
      Shamaliya, storming and besieging it, clamping a curfew on its
      inhabitants, demolishing one of the houses and leaving an injured person,
      who was later arrested, for more than an hour without treatment along with
      other practices proved anew that Zionist terrorism and aggression were
      still savagely targeting our people even under the so-called �peace
      march.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Our people�s joyful reaction to the military confrontation, within the
      occupied homeland and in the diaspora, especially inhabitants of Aseera
      Shamaliya, revealed that our heroic people were still clearly in favor of
      the struggle option. It also proved that our people were not hesitant in
      supporting resistance with all available means despite the attempts to
      blackout or to forge the will of that people in service of the meager
      settlement program. Hence, we call for backing the resistance option on
      the official level and allowing the Arab peoples to support that option so
      that it would succeed in defeating occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">While greeting our people especially inhabitants of the steadfast Aseera
      Shamaliya, we hold the PA responsible for arresting Mujahid Mahmoud Abu
      Hannoud. We strongly call on that Authority to free him along with all his
      brothers the Mujahideen and to stop hurdling the resistance program for
      the enemy�s sake. We affirm that maintaining the detention policy
      against him and his brothers the Mujahideen was an unforgivable national
      crime and posed as a challenge to the will of our Palestinian people and
      the Arab and Islamic Nation, which are in dire need of such heroes to lead
      the Jihad and struggle in defense of the Aqsa, Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and
      Palestine. We also warn against any harm done to him or delivering him to
      the enemy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We appeal to our Arab and Islamic Nation at this crucial stage in history
      of the cause, with Al-Quds and the Aqsa being main symbols of that stage,
      to shoulder its responsibility in confronting the Zionist enemy, its
      practices and ambitions. We call on it to back our people�s rights,
      support their heroic resistance and bolster their insistence on national
      soil, Al-Quds and sanctities.</p>
