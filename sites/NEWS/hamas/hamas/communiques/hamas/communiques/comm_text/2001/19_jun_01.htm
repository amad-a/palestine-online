      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">While our Palestinian
      people�s Jihad is ongoing and their brave intifada is approaching its
      tenth month, the Zionist occupation is still practicing utmost degree of
      repression and terrorism against our people. This calls on our Arab and
      Islamic Nation, governments and peoples, to side by our people: defending
      and supporting their resistance with all means available especially when
      that resistance was offering one martyr after the other to liberate the
      holy lands and to defend the Nation and its holy shrines.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">At this historic and
      sensitive stage we were surprised at the Islamic Resistance Movement,
      Hamas, with the Jordanian authorities� detention of brother Ibrahim
      Ghoushe at the Amman Airport preventing him in the process from returning
      to his country from his forced exile in the Qatari capital Doha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We present you with this
      memo to explain the surrounding conditions and indications of that
      denounced Jordanian decision. To explain the situation we would summarize
      our viewpoint in the following points:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- The crisis dates back
      to 21 months ago after an unjustified decision of the government of former
      premier Abdul Raouf Al-Rawabde closing down information offices of the
      Movement and arresting and prosecuting a number of its leaders and
      sympathizers. The government then decided to deport five of the Hamas
      Movement�s political bureau members from Jordanian territory. The
      government then attributed its measures to a number of justifications that
      were neither credible nor realistic. All Jordanian parties, political and
      syndicate organizations along with the Islamic and national figures in
      that country rejected the measure in its capacity as contravening to the
      Jordanian constitution and international law other than harming national
      Jordanian and pan-Arab interests. The rejection emanated from the
      conviction that the measure was in response to Zionist and American
      pressures on the Jordanian government.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- The Movement did not
      spare any effort to solve the crisis and its negative repercussions
      through adopting flexible stands towards all Arab mediation initiatives in
      a way taking into consideration Jordan�s circumstances and interests and
      at the same time preserving the Movement and the brothers� right of
      citizenship and duty to work for their country and cause. However, the
      Jordanian government closed all doors before dialogue, negotiations and
      rational solutions. It opted to escalating the situation, turning down all
      initiatives and insisted on its stand of rejecting return of the brothers
      to Jordan. Thus it led the internal Jordanian situation into an ordeal
      that the Jordanian government could have been spared other than worsening
      relations with a sisterly Arab country.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- The Movement expected a
      positive change in the Jordanian government�s policy with the advent of
      the new government of Ali Abul Ragheb towards the issue of the deportees
      especially in the light of our people�s intifada and the terrorist
      Sharon�s government�s terrorism and repression. Yet the new government
      chose to follow the path of Rawabde�s government in its irrational
      dealing with the issue at a time when it was keen to maintain strong
      relations with the government of terrorist Sharon through retaining his
      embassy open under Jordanian security protection.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- The brothers the
      chairman and members of the political bureau�s right to Jordanian
      citizenship and return to their country was guaranteed by the Jordanian
      constitution and international law. This citizenship is a genuine one
      since establishment of the Kingdom following the 1951 unity between the
      east bank and west bank, which fell under Zionist occupation while under
      Jordanian sovereignty. It is thus a citizenship not to be stripped via a
      ministerial decision under pressure by enemies of our Nation and their
      allies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- It is no secret to all
      the nature of the inter-mingled Jordanian-Palestinian relationship as a
      result of the historical and geographic character of both countries.
      Furthermore, the de facto Palestinian political endeavor in Jordan refutes
      the Jordanian government�s pretexts for its measures. Most Palestinian
      organizations are present in the Jordanian arena while carrying the
      Jordanian nationality. There are even some members of the Jordanian
      parliament who are at the same time members in the Palestinian national
      council and in Palestinian organizations. They occupy political positions
      in those organizations. There are also ministers in the Palestinian
      Authority who are still carrying Jordanian citizenship and live with their
      families in Jordan.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- Bargaining with the
      deported brothers on surrendering either their Jordanian nationality or
      political role in the Movement is extremely serious and is rejected at the
      same time. There is no conflict between both matters for working for the
      Palestine cause via the Hamas Movement or any other organization is a
      legitimate national duty on each and every Arab and Muslim not speaking
      about the Palestinian. It is not permissible under any circumstances to
      deprive the Palestinian and Arab citizens from their natural right of
      citizenship because they shoulder their duty towards the Nation�s
      central cause and conflict with the Zionist enemy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">7- Brother Ibrahim
      Ghoushe�s step in exercising his right of returning to his country would
      have been open for a solution if the Jordanian government had dealt with
      the matter in a rational way especially when the constitution guarantees
      him this right of returning to his country whenever he wishes. Yet the
      Jordanian government violated this right through detaining <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>and
      depriving him from entry. Nonetheless, the Jordanian government still owns
      the key to that problem namely by allowing him and his brothers to enter
      their country and live there among their people and families.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">8- To affirm Hamas
      Movement�s keenness on unity of Arab ranks, it welcomes any constructive
      effort based on the return of Eng. Ghoushe to his country along with his
      deported brothers especially when we showed enough flexibility and took
      into consideration the general interests of Jordan, our cause and our
      Nation as a whole.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Esteemed leaders of
      parties, syndicates and organizations:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We table these events and
      facts before you to put you before your national and pan-Arab
      responsibilities. We hope that you would shoulder your duty towards this
      issue. Your support to the deported brothers� right of return to their
      country to serve their people and cause with all available means would
      serve as a solid support to resistance and Jihad in Palestine in addition
      to our Palestinian people and other peoples of our Nation�s endeavor for
      the sake of the Palestine cause. It would further deepen the basic and
      important Arab role towards Palestine in its capacity as the question of
      All Arabs and Muslims and in its capacity as the foremost defense line of
      the Nation and its civilization project in face of the Zionist project.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">We pray for
      your constant support to our people�s Jihad and our Nation<b><o:p>
