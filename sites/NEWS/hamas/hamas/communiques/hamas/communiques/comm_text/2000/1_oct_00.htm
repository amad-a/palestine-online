      Al-Quds (Jerusalem), sanctities and the Aqsa � and in support of the
      Arab and Islamic Nation's dignity, the precious Palestinian blood

      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      whole world that our people are not tired or weakened and will never
      succumb to humiliation, repression and occupation and that they are still
      capable of sacrifice, resistance and confrontation of the Zionist
      occupation savagery in defense of Al-Quds and the Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Zionist occupation army's confrontation of our unarmed Palestinian
      masses employing thousands of panicked soldiers who used live bullets,
      internationally banned bullets along with armored vehicles and Lao
      missiles to commit brutal war crimes against demonstrations of our people
      exposes the truth of the illusionary peace with that enemy. It further
      affirms that coexistence between the victim and the culprit is a big lie
      for that criminal enemy only understands the language of suppression,
      terrorism and sacrilegious acts. That enemy wants complete surrender of
      our people to all its conditions but the blood of our people that was shed
      everywhere on all parts of our usurped lands revealed reality of that
      spiteful enemy no matter how much supporters of peace and settlements try
      to deceive our people and Nation over that fact.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This blessed Intifadha came as a strong response to the crime of the
      Barak government in collusion with Sharon and his followers against the
      Aqsa. It also came in retaliation to allowing him to stroll in the Aqsa
      plaza under the protection of thousands of soldiers and accompanied by a
      military build up that was not even known during the time the Aqsa was
      occupied. It also came in response to the enemy's stands in declaring
      its insistence on sovereignty over Jerusalem and the Aqsa and declarations
      by its leaders on the intention of constructing their alleged temple in
      the Aqsa Mosque. Hence came this Intifadha and the bloodletting as a
      strong message that we will burn the grounds under feet of the usurpers
      and that any tampering with the Aqsa or desecrating it was out of bounds
      that if breeched would move our people young and old, women and men,
      elderly and children and that rivers of blood would be shed and martyrs
      fall for its sake.</p>

      day for popular escalation on the anniversary of Salahuddin's liberation
      of Al-Quds. We also call on our masses to continue the Aqsa Intifadha and
      escalate confrontations with enemy soldiers and herds of settlers and
      clash with them in all cities and villages � in all camps, alleys and
      streets of our holy Palestinian lands to protest the savage massacres

      confrontation against aggression. We also invite the Authority to let the

      desecration of the Aqsa through organizing rallies, carnivals and other
      activities to support our people. Let the whole world understand that the
