      Bring us forth from out this town of which the people are oppressors! Oh,

      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">From the holy land of Palestine, from Beit Al-Makdes and the precincts of
      Beit Al-Makdes, from the arena of Jihad, resistance and blessed Intifadha,
      from the heart of the bleeding wounds and ruins, from the screams of
      orphans, widows and bereaved mothers, from the midst of the continuous
      columns of martyrs, I send you, our Nation, an appeal to back the people
      of Palestine. The people of Palestine who are stationed on the cherished
      land of Palestine, the Mujahid for the sake of liberating it from Jewish
      usurpers and the defender of the Nation's dignity and sanctities topped
      by the first Islamic Qibla, third holiest shrine in Islam and Isra� site
      of prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We call on you our people and brothers on behalf of the children of
      Palestine who are facing the enemy with their bare chests. We appeal to
      you in the name of the mothers and wives of martyrs who rejoice each time
      a martyr is raised up to the heavens. We appeal to you in the name of the
      wounded who were mercilessly targeted by enemy helicopter gunships, tanks
      and gunboats. We appeal to you when everything in Palestine has turned
      into a target for the enemy's fire whether civilians, houses,
      installations, streets, trees, mosques and places of worship. Everything
      has been the target of Jewish savagery, terrorism and aggression. The
      martyrs have exceeded 200 persons, the wounded surpassed 7,000 persons
      while thousands of cultivated lands and trees were uprooted, hundreds of
      houses demolished, institutions paralyzed and the people besieged from all
      directions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Day and night your brothers in Palestine are liable to shelling,
      threatening choppers and settlers� sniper fire. What is going on in
      Palestine is a war of liquidation and annihilation. A liquidation of Al-Quds
      (Jerusalem) and the Aqsa, a liquidation of the people and their fighting
      youth generation and even a liquidation of the whole Palestine cause. Your
      brothers� blood is cheap in the eyes of the Jews, killers of prophets,
      and each day your brothers walk in funeral processions and receive more
      wounded and disabled persons. Such terrorism did not single out any
      Palestinian including your brothers stationed in the Palestinian lands
      occupied in 1948.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Our brothers everywhere �</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Your brothers and sisters in Palestine face death each and every moment
      � the columns of martyrs do not stop � the roaring sounds of guns do
      not calm down and all bombard your flesh and blood. Fires break out and
      bodies dismembered as a result of the pouring missiles that assassinate
      our people in broad daylight.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We wonder how long will such a situation persist? How long will silence
      continue vis-&agrave;-vis such premeditated killing of a whole people? How
      long will we be content with condemnation statements that do not help in
      face of liquidating Al-Quds and the Aqsa Mosque in addition to offending
      all human values and norms? If we wait until America �bestows� on us a
      fact-finding committee or international protection or restoration of the
      settlement framework that drowned in our people's blood then the Zionist
      danger will spread into other areas of Arab and Islamic lands.</p>

      is really taking place. Your brothers are besieged in lands and pockets
      without having arms to defend themselves or to ward off death that is
      targeting their families and children. If the conscience of the oppressed
      world had died, then the Arab and Islamic conscience should wake up from
      its long nap � why don�t you support your brothers here with arms,
      money and supplies? Why don�t you open the door for Jihad before the
      Mujahdieen brigades in backing of the people of Palestine and in defense
      of the Aqsa and the holy shrines and to halt the ongoing carnage? The
      people of Palestine beseech you and appeals to you, after praying to
      almighty Allah, for the mothers� screams had reached the farthest point
      on Earth and Allah had obliged you to extend support <b><i>� � but if
      they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to
      help (them)��</i></b> (Quran 8/72)</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      to launch an effective act to save Palestine, its people and Quds in
      addition to boycotting the enemy and draining its source of arrogance on
      the lands of Islam and Muslims.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The wound is deep and the hearts are bleeding. No fine-worded statements
      would be enough, for the time now is for serious and fruitful work for the
      sake of liberating Palestine and its people and lifting the oppression on
      them <b>through the use of force for whatever was taken by force would be
      only regained by force.</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">From the heart of the holy Aqsa Intifadha we hail this Nation, which
      reacted from the ocean to the ocean, to reflect its backing to the people
      of Palestine. Such reactions proved that the question of Al-Quds was not
      solely a Palestinian question but also an Arab and Islamic one. So more
      support is needed along with protection means to our people for the
      situation is extremely grave and Al-Quds is in serious danger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We affirm to you, Muslims everywhere, that we will continue along the
      road of Jihad and we will not be terrorized by the enemy's might or
      suppression for its might, God willing, is dying out and its suppression
      will lose in the end. And we will remain sticking to the land of Palestine
      from the sea to the river and we will proceed in unity under the banner of
      Haq (Right) along the road of Jihad and resistance until victory or
      martyrdom.<b><i><o:p>
