    </b></i><p ALIGN="LEFT">Due to the unfortunate incident that occurred in Rafah on Monday,

    1 February, during which Captain Rifaat Mohammad Judah and the infant Fadwa Jarwaneh were

    killed, we in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), based on our keenness to secure

    national unity and to suppress the sedition that Israel has always sought and which was

    made clear in the Israeli media following that unfortunate incident, and because of

    certain accusations, would like to stress the following:</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000">First</font></b>: Hamas reiterates its consistent

    policy that prohibits internal fighting and its continuous strategy of sparing and

    protecting Palestinian blood.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000">Second</font></b>: Our brothers<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> Usama Taha, Mohammed Abu Shamala and Raed Al Attar<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> whose names were mentioned in connection with this incident by the

    local press, have never been wanted by the PA&#146;s security service since their

    employment in a PA security apparatus headed by Colonel Sami Abu Samhadaneh. Therefore, we

    wonder why they were being chased? And why their problem, if any, has not been solved by

    the security service in which they have been working? We condemn the policy of chasing

    people that is practised by the PA security, such as shooting live gunfire in the streets,

    raiding houses by armed men and damaging their contents, and generally terrifying the

    people. Such policies open the door widely for agents of Israel&#146;s special forces to

    implement their schemes against our People.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000">Third</font></b>: Our People&#146;s blood is

    deposited in trust and is a responsibility of the PA&#146;s security services that should

    protect and guard them. The protection of the blood of Captain Rifaat Judah and the

    children Fadwa Jarwaneh and Mohammed Yaziji was the responsibility of the authority which

    should protect the citizens and enhance the security and stability among the people.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000">Fourth</font></b>: The hasty attempts to link

    Hamas to this incident are rejected and baseless. They do not serve the interests and the

    unity of our People on which Hamas stresses in all its positions, especially during this

    critical stage being experienced by our People and Cause. Therefore, Hamas reiterates its

    rejection of these repeated attempts to deform its bright image and to destroy its Jihad

    and established position, which is based on the fact that our People&#146;s main conflict

    is with the Zionist Enemy.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000">Fifth</font></b>: We in Hamas regrettably condemn

    the disgusting phrases mentioned in Fatah Movement&#146;s statement that was distributed

    in Rafah and which talk of a &#147;misled and misleading category of people&#148; with the

    aim of deforming the image of the Islamists, who proved their honesty and loyalty to their

    Nation and Homeland. Such a statement increases the tension instead of defusing it and

    instead of protecting the security and safety of our society.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000">Sixth</font></b>: Hamas reiterates the necessity

    of making the Israelis and their conspirators miss the opportunity of waging an internal

    war by controlling ourselves and by fighting rumours that aim to destabilize the

    Palestinian arena. We should close the door in the face of those who want to spread

    sedition among our People. Hamas also reiterates its continued resistance of the Zionist

    occupation and usurpation. It also strongly rejects the attempts to transfer the conflict

    into our Palestinian arena.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, we call upon our People to be cautious and to cling firmly by

    means of God&#146;s rope.</p>
