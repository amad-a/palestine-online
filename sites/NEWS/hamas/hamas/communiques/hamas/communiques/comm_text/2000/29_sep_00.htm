      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      unarmed people in the blessed Aqsa Mosque�s yards. Another savage crime
      is added to the record of continuous Zionist terrorism: repression,
      aggression, bloodletting and desecrating sanctities. Five martyrs and more
      than 200 wounded fell by gunshots of the occupation soldiers. Precious
      blood is spilt to color the Aqsa plaza defending and protecting it against
      spiteful Jewish aggression and guarding it against their greediness and
      plots.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">In this manner the hateful assaults against the Aqsa continue day after
      day and year after year and massacre after massacre. And the Mujahid
      Palestinian people young and old, women and men continue to defend their
      Mosque and repel aggression with bare chests, stones, blood, souls and
      confident belief in the victory by the grace of Allah against their
      enemies the Jews.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Our patient Mujahid Palestinian people �&nbsp;<br>
      our Arab and Islamic Nation :</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The blood of our people that was shed today in the Aqsa yards appeals to
      you to shoulder your responsibility and duty towards Al-Quds (Jerusalem)
      and the Aqsa. Those believers, who responded to the Hamas call for the
      defense of the Aqsa, affirm with blood to our people and Nation the
      following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>First</b>: This is the clear and practical response to the greed of
      the Jewish occupiers and to the terrorist Sharon�s stroll in the Aqsa
      yards under the protection of the occupation authority. It is the strong
      retaliation to Barak and his government�s greed. Al-Quds was and will
      remain Palestinian, Arab and Islamic and the Aqsa Mosque, the Muslims�
      first Qibla and site of the prophet�s Isra�, will remain under our
      people and Nation�s sovereignty. All attempts to steal or desecrate that
      Mosque will end in failure and will crash on the rock of our people�s
      steadfastness and Jihad.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Second</b>: This (spilt) blood form a clear message to the Palestinian
      Authority demanding its immediate withdrawal from the humiliating
      negotiations with the Zionist enemy. That blood further asserts to the
      Authority our people and Nation�s rejection to surrender one inch of Al-Quds
      or any part of the Aqsa Mosque and that the blood of martyrs will burn any
      agreements giving up our people�s rights, Al-Quds and the Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Third</b>: We call on the Palestinian Authority to respond to our
      people and Nation�s conscience and return to the people�s fold and
      their real option of Jihad and martyrdom. We call on the Authority to deal
      with the Zionist enemy in the language that it understands best that of
      force and resistance, the language of Intifadha and revolution against
      oppression, aggression and occupation. Rights are not begged but rather
      grabbed through sacrificing blood and soul for the cause of Allah and in
      defense of His religion and sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b><i>�Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your

      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Nation to support our people, back their Jihad and enhance their
      steadfastness, to end all forms of relationship or negotiations or
      normalization with the criminal enemy and to perform their duty and
      responsibility towards Al-Quds and the Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fifth</b>: We call on our patient Palestinian people to continue
      resisting the criminal enemy and its aggressive ambitions. We request them
      to be always on the alert and be prepared to protect Al-Quds and the Aqsa
      and to foil the enemy�s schemes. We finally ask them to insist on our
      sanctities and on constant readiness to sacrifice for their sake
      regardless of pains and blood.</p>
