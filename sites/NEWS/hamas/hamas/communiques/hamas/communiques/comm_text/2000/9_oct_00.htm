      rabid Zionist terrorist campaigns are continuing and escalating against
      our unarmed people. Thousands of heavily armed herds of settlers attacked
      last night our unarmed people in the city of Nazareth of occupied
      Palestine 1948. Two martyrs fell along with scores of wounded. The attacks
      were backed and protected by the enemy's army. They also attacked our
      people in the suburbs of Al-Quds (Jerusalem), Hebron and Gaza Strip.
      Furthermore, they burnt a mosque in Tiberias. At the same time the
      enemy's government is threatening to wage war against Lebanon and Syria
      and is mobilizing its army along the Lebanese borders in an attempt to rid
      itself from the crisis facing this usurping entity due to escalation of
      our heroic people's Intifadha and the heroes in Hizbullah's kidnap of
      three enemy soldiers. At such a critical time officials in the Palestinian
      Authority's security apparatuses declare the formation of a joint
      security operations room between the PA and each of the Zionist entity and
      the USA only hours after Barak's threat to the PA of terminating the
      peace process if the Intifadha and confrontations do not cease! Here our
      people, after sacrificing the most precious thing they own and still are,
      have the right to wonder: Why form a joint operations room and what is its
      mission? Is it formed to escalate the Intifadha, which has become a
      comprehensive popular demand? Or is it formed to end and abort it in
      accordance with the American-Zionist parties� demand, which fear its
      repercussions and reactions on the Palestinian, Arab and Islamic levels?</p>

      defending themselves. We also salute our people's masses who responded

      consider that such a step had let down our Aqsa, our people and the Arab
      and Islamic peoples that took to the streets in solidarity with our people
      and in support of the Aqsa. But we are content with the fact that our
      people is well aware with the truth and we are content with the promise of
      our prophet, peace be upon him, to the victorious group in Al-Quds and its
      precincts who �would not be harmed by those who differed with them or

      for the return of the settlers or soldiers, who had turned it into
      military barracks and a dagger in the center of the brave city of Nablus.
