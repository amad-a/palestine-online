      intention to visit the Haram Al-Sharif</font></h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">In a fresh provocative step to feelings of our Palestinian people in
      addition to our Arab and Islamic Nation, terrorist Ariel Sharon announced
      his intention to tour the Aqsa Mosque along with a number of his followers
      tomorrow Thursday to assert the Zionist occupation authority's
      sovereignty over the holy Aqsa Mosque</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The step falls in line with continuous Zionist aggressive measures
      against Jerusalem and the holy Aqsa Mosque. It also falls at a time when
      capitulation negotiations undergone by the Palestinian Authority with the
      Zionist enemy were progressing and at a time when Zionist calls are voiced
      out loud demanding sovereignty over the Haram Al-Sharif in preparation for
      building the alleged temple.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Our Palestinian people:<br>
      Our Arab and Islamic Nation:</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Jews have clearly and unequivocally declared their ambition in
      continuing occupation of Jerusalem and the holy Aqsa Mosque. It is quite
      clear that plans to demolish the Aqsa Mosque and build the so-called
      Jewish temple in its place were no longer the aspirations of limited or
      extremist groups in the Zionist society, as some believed. The fact is
      that all Jews believed and shared in such an issue no difference in that
      matter between the labor party led by Barak, the Likud Bloc led by Sharon
      or the Temple Mount Trustees organization led by Girshon Solomon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Palestinian Authority's continuation in negotiations with the
      criminal enemy under such acts and ambitions is a serious pointer to the
      bulk of concessions and bargaining offered by that Authority which dared
      breach our people's principled stands, holy shrines and religion by
      accepting to negotiate over the holy Aqsa Mosque and Jerusalem. The
      Authority has already started to table various solutions and proposals
      such as offering sovereignty over Jerusalem to all world countries as
      stated by Qrei and leaving sovereignty over the Haram Al-Sharif to the
      Security Council in addition to Arafat's declaration on his readiness to
      surrender the Buraq Wall and the Maghareba alley to the Jews!</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      to confront the terrorist Sharon and prevent him from entering the Mosque
      and its yards and to check his attempt to desecrate it regardless of
      sacrifices. Let the masses have a say in rejecting and aborting plans and
      aggressive ambitions of the Jews and in refusing any agreements or
      projects that would undermine our people and Nation's rights in
      Jerusalem, the Aqsa and all sanctities.</p>
