      victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers,�<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </i></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><i>&nbsp;</i>Sharon
      is preparing for aggression � let us prepare for resistance and
      confronting the aggression<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><b>&nbsp;Our great Palestinian people
      � the people of sacrifice</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the light of recent
      developments � quickening events � and after the Zionists experienced
      the same bitterness they inflicted on us � escalation in the Israeli
      public opinion�s demands for revenge � background of the Israeli
      cabinet members � the lust for murder and revenge controlling their
      minds � the bloody criminal history of Sharon � and his threats to
      halt the Aqsa intifada � and wiping out the dream of liberation and
      independence in implementation of his promise to safeguard the security of
      each Israeli individual through forcing submission on the Palestinian
      people and their forces �</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the light of the
      previously mentioned, Sharon started to prepare his terrorist schemes and
      mobilized his racist forces in an attempt to storm the Palestinian
      Authority areas thinking that it would be a picnic for his
      �invincible� army.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Our heroic people � the sons of Qassam,
      Salahuddin, Al-Wazir and Ayyash � your painful blows to that deformed
      entity had shocked its senile premier Sharon who is not capable of safe
      thinking and does not benefit from past lessons. His decisions are based
      on muscles of his arrogant chief of staff. They have forgotten your Qassam
      Brigades, Aqsa Brigades, Quds Brigades, armed popular resistance � you
      are Ayyash, Abayat and Hamran, your are Said Hoteri, Hamed Abu Hijle,
      Ibrahim Abdul Karim and Thabet Thabet. You are the ones who caused that
      enemy�s worst nightmares; you love martyrdom as much as the Zionists
      love life.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yes, Sharon might be able
      to enter our areas but could he get out of them? We believe that the
      Zionists will soon meet their end; their graves will be in our garbage
      dumps. Hundreds of commandos with explosive belts will chase them along
      with thousands of throwers of Molotov cocktails and hundreds of hunters of
      their insect soldiers along with thousands of women and children who pose
      as the logistic support of the courageous heroes. You Zionist women if you
      wish to mourn your sons, brothers and husbands and turn the Zionist
      society into one of only women send the soldiers to us.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our heroic Palestinian
      people � the Mujahideen and strugglers:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">To perform this duty and
      to be victorious in that war we invite you to the following:<b>&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>First: on the
      resistance and confrontation level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Estimate and expect the
      spots through which the Zionists might enter or storm the PA controlled
      areas in coordination with the PA apparatuses.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Based on the former
      point: choose strategic positions for the confrontations and deploy in
      them activists and all those wishing for martyrdom and known for
      distinctive performance to obstruct advance of the occupation army and to
      serve as the people and their institutions� protection shields.
      Commandos would be of benefit in those positions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Ambushes: to be set
      near to target areas (houses of wanted activists), (premises of
      organizations) and to deal with foot patrols when they attempt to storm a
      certain position to arrest or assassinate certain elements.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Planting explosive
      devices along the roads that the occupation troops are expected to pass
      through that would be blasted via remote control (after taking necessary
      precautions, accuracy and preparedness).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- Preparing a big number
      of Molotov cocktails mixed with sticking materials and gas cylinders.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">6- Preparing explosive
      belts � the number to be estimated by experienced elements that would be
      available for any commando wishing for martyrdom amidst the enemies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">7- Installing barricades
      to hurdle the occupation army�s movement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Second: on the security
      level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Monitoring the
      enemy�s moves and collaborators.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Requesting officials of
      sensitive areas to evacuate all precious equipment and to clean their
      offices from sensitive information.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Establishing emergency
      clinics equipped with necessary needs to treat the wounded commandos and
      others in the event the army taking control of hospitals.<b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Third: on the
      mobilization and guidance levels:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Preparing statements
      for circulation in the street including the real facts on events and
      expectations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Field mobilization:
      leaders and representatives of organizations and factions in the city
      would shoulder that responsibility after spreading in various affected
      areas � guiding and lifting the moral. It would be a good idea to use
      unified earphones.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Fourth: on the relief
      level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Forming a relief
      committee in each area in the city grouping voluntary doctors, engineers
      and university professors the soonest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- Preparing relief
      material and securing telephone numbers of owners of tractors and trucks
      to contact them whenever necessary.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- Providing medicines and
      medical equipment for first aid in various areas.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- Providing certain
      foodstuffs and stocking them in stores far from expected strikes at the
      ground floors.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- Counting the buildings
      that might be used as shelters in each area to distribute inhabitants of
      that area on those centers.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">6- Publishing guidance publications that would deal
      with shelling, evacuation procedures, carrying wounded and first aid.<o:p>
