      &nbsp;by Jewish rabbi Ovadia Yossef</font></h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal">�Commenting on the statements of Jewish chief rabbi
      of the ultra orthodox Shas movement Ovadia Yossef in which he described
      the Palestinians as 'snakes� and Arab descendants of Prophet Ismail as
      �liars, evil doers and Allah has regretted that He created them,� �
      Allah is above what they attributed to Him -, an official source in the
      Hamas Movement said:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Such statements reveal the Jews and the occupying
      Jewish-Zionist entity's racist nature. They further reveal that that
      entity was growing in extremism, racism and hatred against all
      Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Such spiteful declarations are only voiced by
      abnormal psyches that view all non-Jews with arrogance and hatred in
      addition to considering other peoples �Guyim� as lesser than Jews who
      consider themselves the �chosen people of Allah.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Quoting Allah as saying such declaration, Allah is
      above what they attributed to Him, affirm their lies and distortion of
      Allah's words as included in the verses <b><i>�Of the Jews there are
      those who displace words from their (right) places.� </i></b>Those
      statements are pronounced almost two weeks after conclusion of the
      ill-fated Camp David summit during which the Jewish-Zionists� plotting
      against Jerusalem was evident along with their aggressive intentions to
      demolish the Aqsa Mosque and build in its place their alleged temple. Such
      statements show how naive are those betting on peace with the usurping
      Zionist entity and coexistence with that extremist occupying people, whom
      Allah had portrayed as treacherous and Said they revoked pledges with Him,
      so will the peace and settlement mongers expect the Jews to respect
      agreements or pledges with them?!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Our people and Nation's experience with the Jews
      affirms that the only feasible road against the usurping occupation is
      that of resistance and Jihad and that the only healing against that
      cancerous disease is total extermination.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>'strongest among men in enmity to the
      Believers wilt thou find the Jews and Pagans.�<o:p>
