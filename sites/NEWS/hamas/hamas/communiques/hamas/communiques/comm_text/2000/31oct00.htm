      and terrorism escalated and the enemy�s army crimes continued including
      shelling our unarmed people with tanks, helicopter gunships and missiles.
      The heavily armed herds of settlers intensified their acts of revenge and
      murder against our people while the fall of martyrs and wounded continued
      along the road of Jihad, resistance and steadfastness in defense of the
      Aqsa, Al-Quds and each and every inch of our holy land.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      and children for their heroic steadfastness and strong challenge to the
      enemy�s army and aggression. We vow to the blood of martyrs and wounded
      to continue along our path and Jihad until our people�s goals are
      realized in driving the occupation away from our lands and holy shrines.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>First</b>: We call on our Palestinian masses and all Islamic and
      nationalist forces to forge more cohesion and unity along the road of
      continuation of the Aqsa Intifadha, to escalate struggle and confrontation
      against the enemy�s army and herds of settlers. We call on them not to
      heed any pressures or attempts to calm down or halt the Intifadha until
      its goals of expelling the occupiers are achieved. <b><u>We also call on
      our people to retaliate to the Zionist aggression and terrorism through
      more escalation, confrontations and days of rage.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Second</b>: We urge all our people, heroes and Mujahideen to chase and
      target enemy soldiers and settlers in all areas of our occupied
      Palestinian lands: in Al-Quds (Jerusalem), the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
      our lands occupied in 1948. Surprise the enemy with your operations and
      brave resistance with arms, knives, Molotov cocktails and all available
      resistance tools and forms. We extend our salutation to the heroes who
      launched the heroic operation in Al-Quds and the martyrdom operation in
      Gaza.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Third</b>: We appreciate the Arab countries that responded to our
      calls and our people�s requests for solidarity with the Aqsa Intifadha
      and severed relations with the criminal enemy. Meanwhile, we appeal to the
      other countries, which are still establishing relations with the enemy of
      our people and Nation and allowing its embassies and representation
      offices to continue functioning, to immediately sever those relations in
      retaliation to the enemy�s crimes and continued massacres against our
      families and children and in solidarity with the blessed Aqsa Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fourth</b>: We salute our Arab and Islamic masses that are still
      reacting in solidarity with our people and that are still organizing
      programs in support of the Aqsa and in condemnation of the Zionist
      aggression. We call on those masses and all Arab and Islamic peoples
      topped by the movements, forces, parties, syndicates, popular and trade
      unions and students� councils to continue their activities and
      solidarity with our people in the lengthy and hard battle against the
      Zionist aggression and occupation. We also appeal to the Arab and Islamic
      media to continue exposing the Zionist aggression and highlighting our
      people�s sufferings, steadfastness and Jihad. For the battle is ongoing
      ... the Intifadha is persisting � the Zionist repression and aggression
      is escalating � and the martyrs and wounded are still falling.<b><o:p>
