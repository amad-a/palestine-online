      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>Commenting
      on the security coordination meeting between security officials in the
      Palestinian Authority, the Zionist enemy and the American central
      intelligence agency that is held today in Cairo, a responsible source in
      the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The Zionist aggression is continuing against our
      people along with the daily killing and cold-blooded assassinations of our
      men and women in addition to besieging and dismembering cities, villages
      and camps and starving our people and children. Terrorist Barak is
      renewing his refusal to surrender sovereignty over Al-Quds and the Haram
      Al-Sharif and his absolute rejection of the return of our people's
      refugees to their lands and country. At such a time, chairman of the
      Palestinian Authority agrees on holding such a serious meeting in
      submission to the Zionist enemy and the American administration's
      dictates. The Zionists had set the condition that the meeting should
      tackle the mean theme of ending what they call violence (i.e. the
      intifada) and fighting terrorism (i.e. resistance). This is the required
      sinful security price that the Palestinians must pay in preparation for
      continuing the absurd negotiations on Clinton's proposals that aim at
      liquidating our cause.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">This dubious meeting has a clear goal namely to abort
      and end our people's intifada � the holy Aqsa intifada, in addition to
      persecuting and liquidating our people's Mujahideen to complement the
      role of the enemy's army and special units.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We denounce the PA's submission and approval to
      name our people's intifada as �acts of violence� and dealing with it
      on equal footing with Zionist terrorism and aggression. We condemn the
      PA's pledge in Washington to work for ending the intifada and repelling
      its heroes and resistance heroes and to accept to attend such a dubious
      meeting in service of occupation and to realize its security at the
      expense of our people's security and rights.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The resumption of security cooperation with the
      Zionist enemy and the American intelligence and under its patronage poses
      as a treacherous stab in the back of our people and the holy Aqsa
      intifada. Furthermore, it scorns the blood of more than 370 martyrs and
      20,000 wounded who fell and still fall in the intifada for the sake of
      expelling occupation, purging the Aqsa and achieving our people's goals
      not for the sake of returning to the negotiations and the criminal
      security cooperation with the enemy. It also deals the cruelest blow to
      national unity that grouped our people around the intifada and struggle
      option and poses as a return to a joint security march with the enemy that
      lead to the death or detention of the cream of our people and Mujahideen.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We, in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, regret
      that Cairo is the venue that hosts and patronizes such a meeting. Egypt
      had always been the supporter of our cause and its people had taken to the
      streets out of anger and condemnation over what the Aqsa and the people of
      Palestine were suffering at the hands of the Zionist aggression. Our
      people always appreciated Egypt. How come it would then host such dubious
      meetings that harm its image and role? Especially when it knows that our
      people reject and condemn such meetings because they are directed against
      them!</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left">We affirm to
      the whole world that the feverish attempts and efforts will end up in
      failure, God willing, and will not be able to deter our people from
      persisting in their Jihad, resistance, intifada and confrontation of the
      Zionist enemy, its war machine and herds of settlers. Our people will
      never deviate from resistance in its capacity as the road leading to
      liberation and restoration of rights.<b><o:p>
