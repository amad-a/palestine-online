      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      and the Zionist entity, failure of the ill-fated Camp David summit was
      declared despite the great efforts and pressures practiced by the American
      administration on the Palestinian side to reach an agreement ending the
      state of conflict with the Zionist enemy and coronating Bill Clinton�s
      tenure in office with such an accomplishment.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Our Palestinian people:<br>
      Our Arab and Islamic Nation:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We have warned from the beginning against involvement in such a summit
      and affirmed that its success would be inevitably at the expense of our
      Palestinian people and our Arab and Islamic Nation. Its success would mean
      the PA�s submission to Zionist-American conditions and its approval of
      the Zionist settlement speculation towards the final status issues namely
      those of Al-Quds (Jerusalem), refugees, borders, settlements and others.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Failure of the summit because of Al-Quds and the Zionist enemy�s
      insistence on retaining it under Zionist sovereignty affirms that the
      arrogant Zionist enemy only accepts the total surrender of our people to
      its will and greed. It also affirms that there is no difference among
      leaders of the occupying entity as far as our people and their legitimate
      rights are concerned. Ehud Barak, who was received with a tumultuous
      welcome by the PA and deceived persons in lines of our people and Nation,
      is not different from Benjamin Netanyahu as far as arrogance, extremism
      and hostility to our people are concerned. Peace, in the concept of those
      people, means absolute submission and surrender to Zionist hegemony and
      means giving up our people�s rights, Quds and sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The assertion by all parties that Al-Quds was the reason for the failure
      and that progress was achieved in all other issues make us wonder about
      what happened over the refugees� right of return, the borders, the
      settlements and other basic questions?!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">All pointers and information indicate that the PA had offered major
      concessions in all those issues but remained stringent on the issue of Al-Quds
      in view of its sensitivity and Arab and Islamic dimensions. For it would
      be difficult to justify any agreement belittling the Palestinian, Arab and
      Islamic rights in Al-Quds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The Camp David negotiations were shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity
      fearing the leakage of information on concessions to the public opinion so
      as not to affect attempts to reach an agreement. Now the time has come
      that our people and Nation should know what did really take place in that
      infamous summit and the PA�s true stands regarding the issues of the
      refugees� return, dismantling of settlements, borders and the
      Palestinian state�s jurisdictions and sovereignty. The general
      satisfaction towards failure of that summit because of Al-Quds should not
      make our people forget their rights and other national stable principles.
      It is also not acceptable to partition the refugees� right of return
      under the pretext of giving priority to the refugees in Lebanon, which
      means that the PA had agreed on a partial return of limited numbers of
      those refugees as suggested by the Zionists.<b><o:p>

      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">In this serious and crucial stage in history of our Palestine cause, we,
      in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>First</b>: we want the PA to brief our people with all frankness and
      transparency on the complete story of its stands towards various final
      status issues and not to deceive our people or play with their feelings.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Second</b>: we urge leaders of the Arab and Islamic countries along
      with the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Conference to adopt
      strong and clear positions in support of our Palestinian people�s
      steadfastness, Jihad and legitimate struggle for liberating their lands
      and defeating occupation. We further ask them to assert their stable
      stands towards Palestinian rights topped by Al-Quds and the refugees�
      right of return to their homeland.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Third</b>: the negotiations� march with the Zionist enemy,
      particularly the latest one in Camp David; confirm the correct course of
      the Hamas Movement and other national forces that reject the settlement
      process. It also affirms the absurdity of the peace process and
      negotiations and failure of that method to liberate the lands and restore
      Al-Quds and our people�s other rights. Hence, the PA is called upon to
      divulge frankly what happened, to withdraw from the negotiations�
      process and not to insist on proceeding along that dead-end.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fourth</b>: the only way to liberate our lands and holy shrines is
      that of Jihad and martyrdom in addition to steadfastness and resistance;
      for rights are grabbed and not begged. Rights are forcibly taken through
      dear blood and unlimited sacrifices. Our people have proven across history
      that they were capable of being patient and steadfast and of launching
      Jihad, struggle and sacrifice for the sake of their sacred cause and
      blessed lands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fifth</b>: we call on the PA to return to the lines of the people and
      re-arrange the Palestinian home from within. We ask it to meet with us
      over a comprehensive Jihad and struggle program, to stop persecution of
      the Mujahideen and to end security cooperation with the enemy. We also
      call on it to free hands of the resistance while protecting its back and
      supporting it, to respect anew the fighting guns and to benefit from
      lessons of the heroic resistance�s victory in South Lebanon and the
      Lebanese official harmony with it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Hamas, along with all loyal elements of our people, will remain faithful
      to its people and cause, loyal to their rights and stable doctrines and a
      guard of their Quds and Aqsa. Hamas will continue to defend, with its
      Jihad and blood of its sons, our people�s rights in their lands and
      sanctities. Hamas will also maintain its defense of the refugees and their
      right of return to their lands and of the heroic detainees and their
      absolute right in freedom.<b><o:p>
