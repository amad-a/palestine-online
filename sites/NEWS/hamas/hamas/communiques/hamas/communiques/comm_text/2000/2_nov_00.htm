      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      the enemy's missiles and tanks without fearing death or terrorism and
      offering one martyr after the other as a price for liberation of the Aqsa
      and Palestine and in defense of the Arab and Islamic Nation's dignity.
      So more patience and more steadfastness, challenge and pride are required
      from you: the people of martyrs and sacrifice. Do not heed any calls for
      halting or aborting your blessed Intifadha and let us continue along the
      road of Jihad and struggle for whatever was taken by force would be only
      regained by force. Such a great slogan was the motto under which the child
      Mohammed Al-Durra has martyred. Thousands greetings are accorded to heroes
      of the daring operations in Gaza and Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and to more such
      resistance by our Mujahideen.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, would like to affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      </o:p>
      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">1- We call on our people's heroes and Mujahideen to chase and target
      enemy soldiers and herds of settlers and let the daring armed operations
      escalate using all forms of resistance. Let the throwing youths continue
      their all-out civilian damage of all enemy interests. Let the ground turn
      into fire burning the occupiers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- We appeal to our people to head in big numbers to the Aqsa Mosque, to
      pray all five prayers there and to guard it for that would be considered
      Ribat (stationing) for the cause of Allah.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- The holy Aqsa Intifadha is an Intifadha to defeat occupation and the
      blood of martyrs and wounded that was spilt targeted defending the Aqsa
      and the holy shrines in addition to defeating occupation. Our people will
      never accept that their sufferings and that blood of their martyrs would
      be the price for returning to negotiations or just to improve conditions
      of negotiations. We affirm our absolute rejection of all meetings between
      the Palestinian Authority and leadership of the criminal enemy the latest
      of which was Arafat's meeting with the terrorist and mass-murderer of
      the Qana massacre Peres for the enemy's crimes had proven that there was
      no way for coexistence between the victim and the culprit.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- We along with our people criticize statements of Mahmoud Abbas, a PA
      official, to Al-Shark Al-Awsat newspaper on 31 October in which he said
      �The Intifadha does not achieve victory and it is of no use.� �
      �We do not want to fight Israel for our option is negotiations and we
      want calm to return gradually� � �What happened at the Cairo summit
      is a great thing and we did not expect more than what happened.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">5- We urge the PA anew to close the political detention file and to
      release the remaining political detainees and Mujahideen in its jails. It
      is not logical that enemy missiles shell our villages and cities while the
      PA is still detaining the honorable Mujahideen. It is high time to tear
      apart security agreements with the enemy and end the PA's abidance by
      them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">6- We are surprised at the PA's decision to limit training on use of
      arms to the Fatah elements and limiting carrying arms only to them since
      such a right should be open to all our people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">7- We affirm the request of the nationalist and Islamic forces to the
      armed men not to fire bullets in the marches among the demonstrators and
      amidst residential quarters, which leads to inflicting severe losses in
      lines of our people as a result of Zionist retaliatory aggressions. We
      urge the armed brothers to chase and target the enemy away from such
      places.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">8- We appeal to our people to express solidarity with cities and villages
      besieged by the enemy forces. We ask them to extend what they can
      including foodstuff to enhance steadfastness of the besieged and to
      organize popular programs to break that siege.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>9- We urge our people to
      support the workers who became unemployed as a result of that siege
      considering their backing as a religious and nationalist duty. The
      institutions that receive donations should perform their role in
      compensating the workers so as to boost our people's steadfastness.</p>

      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Intifadha and we greet the Arab and Islamic communities especially the
      Islamic community in the US. We request their continued activities and
      programs in support of our people and the Aqsa. We ask them to firmly
      oppose the savage Jewish massacres against our children and our unarmed
      people. We demand a continuous, long-range program for our battle with the
      enemy is a lengthy one and the Zionist terrorism and aggression are
      escalating. Furthermore, the Aqsa Intifadha is ongoing and martyrs are
      falling daily.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- We call on the Arab and Islamic leaders, who will meet in the upcoming
      Islamic summit conference in Doha, to adopt vigorous stands to back our
      people's resoluteness, to confront the Zionist aggression and to end all
      forms of relations and normalization with that enemy. We also urge
      sisterly Qatar to close down the Zionist trade representation office and
      we call on both Egypt and Jordan to close the enemy's embassies and
      expel its ambassadors. We demand from the Nation's leaders to prepare
      their peoples for Jihad for the sake of liberating the land of Isra� wal
      Mi�rage. We also ask the Arab and Islamic countries to condemn the
      stands of the US government and congress, which are blatantly biased in
      favor of the Zionist aggression.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- We beseech the Nation's Ulama (religious scholars) and intellectuals
      to pursue along their pioneering role, which they started in support of
      the Aqsa and in encouraging the masses to do the same thing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- We appreciate the brothers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for their
      financial donation to our people and the Intifadha and call on all
      countries to offer more to boost our people's steadfastness. We stress,
      meanwhile, that they should ensure that the funds are channeled to
      families of martyrs and wounded in addition to supporting the Intifadha
      and defending Al-Quds and the Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">5- We urge our Nation to donate blood to save the wounded who fall in
      large numbers each day.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">6- We implore the Arab and Islamic peoples to boycott American goods and
      any party or company dealing with the Zionist enemy. Parties and popular
      organizations in each country should prepare a �blacklist� including
      names of companies and persons dealing with the enemy.</p>

      commitee) and call on our people to launch the following activities:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      occasion of the anniversary of the ill-famed Balfour Declaration.</p>

      tumultuous demonstrations that would follow Friday noon congregations.
      They should witness distinctive escalations and confrontations against the
      enemy's army and settlers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Mohammed is His Messenger� be hoisted over the Aqsa Mosque and the
      honored Dome of the Rock. Let a hero raise such flags each time the enemy
      soldiers bring them down to affirm our people and Nation's sovereignty
      over the holy Aqsa Mosque. Let such flags be raised extensively in all
      marches.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
