      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      provocative step the Zionist enemy�s authorities agreed to build the
      so-called �Temple Mount� and allowed the laying down of the foundation
      stone of the alleged temple near the honored Dome of the Rock. The Jewish
      temple mount trustees� group had purchased more than five tons of marble
      to use one stone of them as the foundation stone at the construction site
      and use the rest in building the foundations. The construction will take
      place tomorrow at the same site under protection of Special Forces of the
      enemy�s army to coincide with the convening of the ill-famed Sharm
      Al-Sheikh summit between chairman of the Palestinian Authority and the
      criminal terrorist Barak with the aim of aborting the holy Aqsa Intifadha.
      It also coincides with the PA chairman�s submission to demands of Barak
      to re-detain Hamas cadres who were freed from PA jails by the masses.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>We, in face of such a hostile step, affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>First:</b> We consider the attempt to lay down the foundation stone of
      the alleged temple in the Aqsa Mosque as a hostile step to our Palestinian
      people and to our Arab, Islamic Nation. We also consider it as a war
      against our religion and Islamic beliefs in addition to representing a
      scorn to feelings of more than 1.3 billion Muslims.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Second:</b> Such a step follows the enemy government�s approval of
      terrorist Sharon�s stroll in the Aqsa plaza in a bid to ascertain
      Zionist sovereignty over the Aqsa Mosque and falls in line with the
      continuous rabid campaign to judaize Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and desecrate
      sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Third:</b> The coinciding of laying down the foundation stone for
      construction of the alleged temple with the convening of the notorious
      Sharm Al-Sheikh summit raises the anger and denunciation of our people and
      Nation towards that summit which would work for foiling our people�s
      Intifadha and frustrating the Nation�s masses that are eager to launch
      Jihad and resistance. It also falls at a time when criminal Barak is
      continuing his aggression and suppression of our people in addition to his
      indifference to our Arab, Islamic peoples� feelings through desecrating
      the Aqsa and allowing the laying down of the foundation stone of the
      temple under the protection of the enemy�s army.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fourth:</b> We urge our faithful, Mujahid people to head early
      tomorrow in massive marches and occupy yards of the Aqsa Mosque to repel
      the attempt of laying the foundation stone of the alleged temple and
      defend the Aqsa with souls and blood. We particularly appeal to our people
      in Al-Quds and in Palestinian lands occupied in 1948 to mobilize the
      biggest possible number of people to foil the enemy�s conspiracies and
      defend our religion and holy shrines. We also call on our people to take
      to the streets tomorrow in angry demonstrations and confrontations with
      the enemy soldiers and herds of settlers in each and every city, village
      and camp to declare our people�s condemnation and rejection over the PA
      chairman�s participation in the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit and to resist
      attempts to judaize the Aqsa and build the alleged temple.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fifth</b>: We appeal to our Arab and Islamic Nation to continue
      programs in support of the Aqsa and in solidarity with our people. We ask
      them to condemn the notorious Sharm Al-Sheikh summit and not to heed
      whatever it issues since it does not represent our Palestinian people nor
      our Arab and Islamic peoples.<b><o:p>
