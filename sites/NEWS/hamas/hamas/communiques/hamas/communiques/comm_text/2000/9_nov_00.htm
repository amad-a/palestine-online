      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      footage of the child Mohammed Al-Durra was not the first of its kind and
      will not be the last to expose the degree of hatred and savagery, which
      the Jewish usurpers harbinger against our people, for such images recur
      daily at the hands of the enemy soldiers and herds of malicious settlers.
      We witnessed the child Ahmed Al-Khafsh martyred after a spiteful settler
      intentionally hit the boy with his car then pursued him to ensure his
      death. We also witnessed the Jerusalemite young girl Shifa� Al-Hindi
      losing her eyesight after the enemy soldiers beat her with their rifle
      butts for refusing to take off her veil. We witnessed the 23 days old
      infant suffocating from the occupation teargas in Khaleel (Hebron). There
      are a lot other atrocities against our people and holy shrines for many
      mosques were shelled, holy books torn and anti-Islamic and anti-prophet
      statements were written on the walls. The Zionist massacres are ongoing
      including the bombing of civilian houses with tanks and armored vehicles
      as martyrs and wounded continue to fall under the very eyes of the whole
      world, which stands idle by because the victims are Palestinians but the
      situation would be completely different if occupation soldiers or settlers
      are touched or captured.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Our
      Palestinian people � our Arab, Islamic Nation� we in the Islamic
      Resistance Movement, Hamas, would like to affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">First:
      on the Palestinian level:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1-
      We call on our Mujahid people to continue the holy Aqsa Intifadha and to
      escalate their revolt turning it into fire eating up the occupiers. We
      also ask them not to heed any call for tranquility or an end to the
      uprising under any pretext. We affirm that this Intifadha is an Intifadha
      to defeat occupation and not to return to the negotiations option or to
      improve negotiating conditions. The settlement process, which some of our
      people are still insisting on, has turned into a dead body and whoever
      attempts to reinvigorate it would be only deceiving himself and would be
      only met with a mirage.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2-
      The meeting that is to take place in Washington with the US president
      Clinton is nothing but a fresh attempt by the US and the Zionist entity to
      halt and abort the Intifadha. It will end up in failure similar to the
      Sharm Al-Sheikh and other open and secret meetings because all those
      meetings do not cope with our people�s aspirations and do not achieve
      any of their goals. Our people only expect evil from such meetings where
      the US and the Zionist entity attempt to conspire on blood of martyrs and
      the Aqsa Intifadha, which will nonetheless persist and no-one will be able
      to stop it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3-
      We urge our people in Nablus to break the siege and curfew imposed on the
      town of Hawwara for more than 35 days. We ask them to organize a
      solidarity campaign under the title of �Let the curfew on Hawwara be
      lifted�.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">4-
      We appeal to our brothers in the Fatah Movement to stick to the Intifadha
      option and not to abide by any directives aimed at ending the Intifadha or
      resistance. The Intifadha and resistance unite our people while the
      negotiations and concessions divide them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">5-
      We advise our people to be careful of attempts by certain elements to
      smuggle Zionists goods, especially the rotten ones, into the Palestinian
      markets benefiting from the prevailing difficult conditions and the
      exhaustion of foodstuffs and other supplies. Those goods are hazardous to
      the health of our offsprings.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">6-
      Our people, with all its forces and factions, denounce the Palestinian
      Authority�s insistence to ignore all popular calls and appeals to close
      down the political detention file and to free all political detainees and
      Mujahideen. Scores of them are still thrown in PA jails especially in the
      West Bank. Closure of that file will remain an urgent request for our
      people in addition to being the first step towards crystallizing national
      unity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">7-
      We beseech our people to stand alongside the workers who lost their jobs
      as a result of the siege. Many of them do not find what to eat or what to
      feed their children. Let us all stand by them as people, individuals and
      popular institutions, so that the worker would not alone pay the price of
      the Intifadha. Let us form voluntary popular committees in each city to
      cater for the workers and support them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Second:
      on the Arab and Islamic levels:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1-
      We urge the Islamic summit to back our people and support the holy Aqsa
      Mosque. We call on the conference to be in harmony with stands of the
      Islamic peoples who demand suspending all forms of relations and
      normalization with the Zionist enemy, opening the door for Jihad to
      liberate Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the sanctities and to prepare the Nation
      for that day. We call on the summiteers to support struggle in Palestine,
      recognize its legitimacy, supply it with money and arms, pressure the US
      to end its unlimited support of Zionist aggression and employ the Arab and
      Islamic oil weapon in the battle.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2-
      We appeal to the Arab and Islamic peoples in addition to parties,
      syndicates and popular bodies everywhere to organize marches and angry
      protest activities. The wonderful reaction at the first weeks of the
      Intifadha addressed a clear message to the whole world namely that our
      Arab and Islamic peoples would not remain hands folded in face of the
      persisting Zionist bloodbaths. In view of the continuation and escalation
      of Zionist aggression, we call for activating popular moves by displaying
      rage towards such a situation and expressing solidarity with our people
      and the Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3-
      We urge the Arab and Islamic people to boycott Zionist and American goods
      in retaliation to the occupation�s crimes and the US attempt to conceal
      them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Third:
      the activities: (We affirm the activities included in the national,
      Islamic follow up committees in various districts in our country) and call
      on our people�s masses to organize the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1-
      Today Thursday 9/11 should witness marches during which photos of martyrs
      and Palestinian flags decorated with �There is no God but Allah and
      Mohammed is His Messenger� are hoisted on the anniversary of the passing
      of more than 40 days on the fall of our first group of martyrs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2-
      Tomorrow Friday 10/11, and on each Friday, should be a day of popular rage
      and massive marches starting from mosques following the Friday noon
      congregation. There should be heroic confrontations with the enemy
      soldiers and herds of settlers to affirm continuation of the Intifadha and
      our people�s insistence on Al-Quds and holy shrines in addition to
      rejecting attempts to abort the Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3-
      Sunday 12/12 should be a day of distinctive escalation, massive
      demonstrations and confrontations on the inauguration of the Islamic
      summit to ask the summit to support our people and to resist the Zionist
      aggression.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">4-
      There should be continuous visits to families of martyrs and wounded to
      check their conditions and express our people�s solidarity with them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Let
      the holy Aqsa Intifadha continue � an Intifadha to defeat occupation</p>
