    of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has stated the

    following:</strong></em></p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allegation by some officials of the Palestinian Authority that some

    brothers in the jails of the Israeli Enemy had sent a letter to the Hamas leadership

    pertaining to contacts with the Enemy are absolutely baseless. Hamas leadership, whether

    in or out of the Occupied territories, did not receive such a letter from its heroes

    detained in the Occupation jails.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that the Palestinian Authority creates a crisis among

    our people and their active forces, especially Hamas, whenever the PA has a crisis with

    the Zionist Enemy. This is considered a desperate attempt by the PA to disturb Hamas, its

    positions, its Mujahideen and its detained heroes; and to distract the public opinion from

    the PA&#146;s crisis with the Occupation. This is one of the fabrications and calumnies

    which the PA used to spread and which have become known to all of our people.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hamas reiterates its decisive and clear position that the resistance of

    the Zionist Occupation is a legitimate right of all our people as long as the Zionists

    occupy our land and our Jerusalem, and until our people achieve their goals of liberation,

    freedom and the right to return. Hamas also reiterates that the resistance option is not a

    question of bargaining at any time.</p>
