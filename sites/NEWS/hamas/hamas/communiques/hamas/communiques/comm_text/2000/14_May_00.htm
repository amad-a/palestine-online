      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The heroic detainees in prisons of the Zionist enemy's jails continue
      their open hunger strike demanding their release and ending their ordeal
      after the humiliating peace agreements and negotiations between the
      Palestinian Authority and the enemy failed to set them free. Their strike
      was also launched after hopes of most of them in freedom faded away due to
      their political opposition to the capitulatory agreements concluded with
      the usurping occupiers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The heroic detainees have decided to take the matter into their own hands
      and extract their own thorns, thus they launched the battle of empty
      stomachs to halt the series of oppression, suppression and torture, which
      they daily suffer in enemy jails. They also decided to resist attempts to
      break their will and steadfastness by humiliation, beating, constant
      provocations, solitary confinement, which lasted for more than three years
      for some of them, depriving them of seeing their relatives and children
      and refusing to provide medicine or medical treatment along with bad
      detention conditions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We, in the Hamas Movement, affirm our absolute support to all heroic
      detainees and stress the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">1- we hail the heroes of our people and their towering symbols in jails.
      We assert to them that their cause will permanently remain at the top of
      our priorities and programs. We also affirm that liberating them will
      remain the noble goal that we will work for along with all our people and
      Mujahideen. We stress that our people will never forget them regardless of
      their affiliation and will never forget their sacrifices and Jihad for the
      sake of their people, cause, nation, Quds and sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- our people's Intifadha in various areas of our country against the
      enemy soldiers and settler herds is but a reflection of the faithfulness
      of our people, young and aged, women and men, to those heroic detainees.
      The uprising also points to the status of those heroes, the bright stars
      in our country's skies and in hearts and conscience of our country and
      nation's hearts.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- we call on our Palestinian people in each and every city, village and
      refugee camp to maintain their supportive campaigns with the detainees and
      to escalate popular confrontations with the enemy soldiers and settler
      herds in solidarity with the heroic detainees and to mobilize all efforts
      for the sake of ensuring their release.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- we ask the Palestinian Authority to immediately halt its absurd
      negotiations with the Zionist enemy if it was really serious in adopting
      the issue of the detainees.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">5- we beseech leaders of Arab and Islamic countries along with the Arab
      League and the Islamic Conference Organization to express solidarity with
      the detainees of our steadfast people and to adopt their just cause in all
      international platforms. We appeal to them to organize activities and
      different programs to spread awareness of their case and shed light on
      their sufferings in addition to exercising all necessary efforts to
      guarantee their release.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">6- we call on the UN Secretary General Mr. Kofi Annan to exert all
      efforts possible to liberate our detainees in enemy jails and to halt all
      forms of repression and violation of human rights and dignity of those
      detainees at the hands of the occupation authority.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">7- we invite our people to launch a commercial strike in all occupied
      Palestinian lands tomorrow Monday 15 May in solidarity with our heroic
      detainees and to display popular backing for their release and to declare
      our people's rejection of the establishment of the usurping Zionist
      entity on our occupied lands, the anniversary of which falls tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">As for you, the brave heroes behind bars, towering like the Dome of the
      Rock, loyal men who made glory for their people and nation � we feel
      with you, all your sufferings and pains, steadfastness and patience,
      revolution against the jailers, hunger strike. We will remain in your
      support with all our might until you enjoy freedom, break the shackles of
      imprisonment and return to your people and families.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Let us all stand united in backing of the detainees to realize their
      goals of freedom and dignity and let confrontations escalate in all areas
      against occupation, its soldiers and settlers and let us all stick to the
      option of steadfastness �If you raise high the word of Allah, He will
      make you victorious and steadfast.�<o:p>
