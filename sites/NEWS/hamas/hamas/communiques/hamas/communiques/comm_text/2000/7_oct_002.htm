      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We herald to our Mujahid people today the good omens of defeating Zionist
      occupation at a dear spot in our precious homeland. The enemy withdrew in
      humiliation thanks to Allah in the first place then to the heroic
      resistance and Jihad cohesion expressed by our people ever since the
      outbreak of the Aqsa Intifadha and finally thanks to the blood of martyrs
      that poured over the country's lands and holy Aqsa's plaza. On this
      occasion we would like to affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">1-This tombstone was known a long time ago as an Islamic mosque that the
      Jews had no right in it at all whether historically or religiously. The
      Islamic Waqf documents prove that the tombstone was an Islamic Waqf and a
      mosque for Muslims and remained so for a long period until the herds of
      settlers came to plant a dagger in that brave city and convert the
      tombstone into a military camp through claiming Jewish right in that
      Islamic Waqf while it is well known that prophet Yousef, peace be upon him
      had lived, died and buried in Egypt.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- We call on our people to end the destruction and burning of that Waqf
      and Islamic mosque. We call on them to preserve, clean and purge it from
      dirt of the settlers and deal with that event in a civilizational way
      coping with our Mujahid Palestinian people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- We ask the Islamic Awqaf department in Nablus to take the initiative
      and take control of the mosque, cleaning and purging it in addition to
      restoring things to normalcy and appoint a servant and an Imam for that
      mosque to supervise and serve it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- We request our people in Nablus district to share in purging that
      mosque through maintaining the five daily prayers in it, which would bear
      the real meaning of liberating that Islamic shrine. Let the immortal calls
      of Allahu Akbar rise high from above that mosque.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">5- We urge the Awqaf department and all Muslims in that city to form a
      committee that would reconstruct that mosque so as to host the five daily
      prayers and to open a school for memorizing the holy Quran in it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Finally we call on all Muslims in the city and district of Nablus to
      offer the next Friday's noon prayers 13/10/2000 at the yards of that
      Islamic shrine �the tombstone of prophet Yousef.�<b><o:p>
