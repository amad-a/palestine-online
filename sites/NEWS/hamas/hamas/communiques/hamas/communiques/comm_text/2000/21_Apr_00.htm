      </font></h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
      heroic detainees in prisons of the Zionist enemy are persisting in their
      hunger strike, which they started on 10th April to pressure the Zionist
      entity into releasing them and end their suffering. Their strike is
      further aimed at protesting their inhuman detention conditions and the
      daily harassments and suppression, which they are subjected to at the
      hands of the Zionist prison authorities.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Those
      heroic detainees, held behind bars, in solitary confinement and in savage
      torture cellars � are the Palestinian people's conscience and their
      bright stars who have waged Jihad for the sake of their people and Arab
      and Muslim Ummah. They have struggled in defence of their people and
      Ummah's dignity, Quds and sanctities. They are now tormented in
      occupation prisons, aspiring for freedom and an end to their suffering and
      detention.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">More
      than two thousand detainees are subjected daily to cruel courses of
      humiliation and oppression in addition to attempts to break their will and
      steadfastness. They are stripped of their clothes, thrown with gas
      canisters, beaten and provoked by hateful Zionist jailers other than
      solitary confinement in dark cells for long periods that lasted for more
      than three years for many of them.</font></p>

      steadfast Palestinian people<o:p>

      </font></h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This
      is not all that your sons suffer in Zionist oppressive dungeons, for
      writing about them takes long pages of pain and anger. Lately the Zionist
      prison authorities opened a big prison specially for isolating Palestinian
      captives called Hadarim. A big number of Palestinian detainees were thrown
      there and not allowed to see their relatives for more than six months
      while continued solitary confinement penalties continued against prisoners
      in Beer Sheba and Ashkelon prisons.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
      occupation authorities also cancelled a lot of gains and rights extracted
      by detainees during the past few years through their Jihad, struggle and
      steadfastness. They were now deprived of seeing their children and
      prevented from receiving second-degree relatives.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
      face of such Zionist inhuman practices that contradict all international
      laws and norms, to improve their detention conditions, to re-impose their
      cause that was lost and faded because of the Palestinian Authority's
      continued concessions and submission to Zionist dictates in various
      negotiation rounds, and to pressure the Zionist enemy into releasing them,
      the heroic detainees waged the �war of empty stomachs� and maintained
      their hunger strike since 10th of this month.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Those
      heroic detainees� main demand is their release to acquire their right of
