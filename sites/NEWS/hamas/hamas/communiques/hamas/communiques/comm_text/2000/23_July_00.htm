      </h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">The
      negotiations and bargains on the rights of our people and their sanctities
      are continuing in Camp David between the Palestinian Authority and the
      Zionist entity. The American president Bill Clinton insists on retaining
      each of Arafat and Barak to continue pressures on the Palestinian party so
      as to offer more concessions and surrender our people�s rights and holy
      shrines for the sake of attaining an agreement coronating his period in
      office that is about to terminate.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">The
      negotiations are currently focusing on a number of American proposals over
      major issues of the final settlement basically emanating from the
      notorious (Abu Mazen-Beilen) doctrine. The proposals stipulate that the PA
      would give up Al-Quds to remain under sovereignty of the usurping Zionist
      entity in return for an administrative self-rule in the old quarters of
      the city and surrounding suburbs. They further stipulate annexing the
      settlements of Ma�aleh Adomim and Giva�at Ze�ef to Al-Quds and
      allowing the Palestinians a safe passage to the Aqsa Mosque, which would
      be under religious administration only.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">In
      a bid to beautify the agreement, a Palestinian state with separated areas
      and pruned sovereignty, the borders and authorities of which would be
      determined by the Zionist enemy, would be declared. It would have no army
      while the enemy would have the right of using its air space and deploying
      its army in the Jordan Valley. Meanwhile the West Bank would be linked to
      the Gaza Strip via a flyover bridge.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">As
      for the Zionist settlements, most of them would remain in their places and
      annexed to the occupation entity in return for exchanging certain areas.
      The Zionists would enjoy freedom of movement in the vicinity of those
      settlements that spread like cancer in all of our occupied lands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">The
      refugees� right of return to their lands would be dropped and efforts
      would be made to re-settle them in their diaspora. They would be bribed
      with sums of money as the occupation entity pledged to accommodate a few
      number of them within family re-union programs. Only half a million
      refugees would be accommodated gradually in the Palestinian mini-state
      over a period of 20 years!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Our
      Palestinian people � Our Arab and Islamic Nation</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">This
      is the perilous deal that is being negotiated, a mutilated Palestinian
      state with no sovereignty, will or dignity. It is in fact a self-rule
      entity linked to the Zionist regime. A deal that stipulates selling Al-Quds
      and the holy shrines topped by the Aqsa Mosque in return for running
      municipal services, health and sewerage along with forsaking the
      refugees� right of return to their lands leaving them for ever in camps
      of the diaspora.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">What
      is going on in Camp David is a Zionist-American plot against our people,
      rights, lands, sanctities and Arab and Islamic dignity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Al-Quds
      and Palestine are blessed holy lands and are part and parcel of the
      Muslims� religion and creed. They host the Aqsa Mosque the Muslims�
      first Qibla and the site of prophet Mohammed�s Isra� (night journey)
      and the third mosque that Muslim should visit as the prophet, peace be
      upon him, had said. Muslims across the centuries and generations had
      colored that blessed soil with their blood to retain it in Muslims�
      hands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Any
      surrendering of Al-Quds or part of it is a surrender of the Arab and
      Islamic Nation�s religion and pride and is a flagrant aggression on our
      creed and sanctities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">No
      one could or own the right of giving up Al-Quds. Whoever attempts to do so
      is reneging on our people and Nation�s will, a servant to our enemy, an
      aggressor on our religion and creed. He would not bind us, our people,
      Arab and Islamic Nation with a thing and he thus represents only himself.<b><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>We,
      in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), call for the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>First</b>:
      We demand Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to immediately withdraw
      from the farcical Camp David�s conspiracy and return instead to the
      lines of our people in their steadfastness and resistance of the Zionist
      enemy and its schemes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Second</b>:
      We urge our steadfast, Mujahid Palestinian people to reflect their anger
      regarding the cheap bargaining in Camp David over our people, lands,
      sanctities and rights with all possible means.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Third</b>:
      We appeal to our Arab and Islamic peoples, parties, Movements, groups,
      authorities, syndicates, unions and popular forces to reject any
      concession or capitulation in the land of Palestine, Al-Quds and the Aqsa
      Mosque. We also invite them to express their stands and raise up high
      their voices to contribute in foiling the conspiracy targeting Palestine
      and Al-Quds. It is a compulsory duty on each and every Muslim all over the
      world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Fourth</b>:
      We ask leaders of the Arab and Islamic Nation along with the Arab League
      and the Organization of Islamic Conference to confront any concession or
      surrendering of Palestine or Al-Quds and to pressure the PA to prevent it
      from responding and submitting to Zionist and American pressures.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">We,
      in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), along with our Palestinian
      people and our Arab and Islamic Nation will continue to hold fast to our
      right in our land, Quds and Sanctities. We will continue our steadfastness
      and struggle and mobilizing our Nation in confrontation of the Zionist
      occupation and arrogance. We will grab our rights, lands and holy shrines
      with our own hands by the grace and help of Allah regardless of the lapse
      of time for the Zionist enemy does not understand the language of begging
      and submission, which only increase its aggressiveness and arrogance. It
      only understand the language of Jihad, resistance and martyrdom, that was
      the language that led to its blatant defeat in South Lebanon and it will
      be the language that will defeat it on the land of Palestine. We are
      confident in Allah�s promise of victory.<b><o:p>
