      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">The Lebanese people along with the Arab
      and Islamic Nation these days celebrate the resistance�s victory over
      the enemy�s army and its quislings in South Lebanon. Here it is, the
      Zionist enemy, running away from South Lebanon humiliated, panicked and
      defeated. And here it is the army of agent Lahd collapsing and vanishing
      completely after the brave Islamic and nationalist Lebanese resistance
      turned its life, along with that of the occupation, into unbearable hell
      thanks to heroism and daring operations of the Mujahideen.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">Lebanon, on the official and popular
      levels, has adopted and supported the resistance with all its trends,
      sects and strength. It extended support and backing, it was patient and
      bore the repercussions, blood � pain � tears, and here it is now
      reaping the fruit of its patience, Jihad and stands.<b><o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR"><b><font color="#0000FF">Our Arab and
      Islamic Nation :</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">The victories of our people in Lebanon
      against the Zionist enemy affirm beyond any doubt that Jihad, resistance,
      blood and sacrifices extract rights. Victory is not granted nor begged.
      The Lebanese victory emphasizes that the Zionist enemy only understands
      the language of force and arms and only kneels before steadfast men. The
      Palestinian people should be fully aware of that lesson and to resume,
      with its guidance, their Jihad and resistance.<b><o:p>

      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">It is really painful that at the time
      when the Lebanese people and government affirm their cohesion and support
      to the resistance and achieve their wonderful victories, the Palestinian
      Authority, on behalf of the occupation, pursues the Mujahideen to arrest
      them. It also confronts our angry masses and prevents them from engaging
      the occupation soldiers. The PA is also seeking to abort the latest
      Palestinian detainees� Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" dir="LTR">The PA thought that through such
      practices it would please the occupiers and facilitate its humiliating
      negotiations with them while Barak�s arrogance was increasing along with
      his conditions and dictates on the PA, which finally gives up because it
      lost all pressure and power cards and stood before the Zionist enemy
      completely paralyzed and submissive.</p>
