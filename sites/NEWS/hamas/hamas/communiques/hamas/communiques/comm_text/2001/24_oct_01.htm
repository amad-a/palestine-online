      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>Our Arab and Islamic
      Nation:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A new massacre is
      committed by the Zionsit enemy this time in Beit Reema village, Ramallah
      district, scores of martyrs and wounded have fallen in the streets,
      squares and olive orchards of that village. The enemy has prevented
      paramedics from carrying away the bodies of martyrs or extending
      assistance to the wounded and has even fired at the doctors and medical
      teams. Such acts have been taking place today and last night in Beit Reema
      while scores of martyrs were falling in Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Bethlehem.<b><u><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our Mujahid, patient and
      steadfast people in Beit Reema and in the entire land of Palestine are
      asking today what is our Nation waiting for? What is our Nation's
      reaction while witnessing its sons in the holy land murdered, slaughtered
      and their houses and villages demolished and destroyed? Is such silence
      towards this pogrom permissible among brothers and holders of the same
      religion? Will Arab dignity and chivalry accept continuation of that
      silence? What is the Nation waiting for, if such daily shed blood did not
      make it act?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We ask the Nation's
      leaders and governments to shoulder their historic responsibility towards
      the Zionist enemy's massacres of our people. We urge them to embark on
      an urgent initiative and practical steps to save and defend our people and
      check the Zionist aggressions. We call on them to exercise real and
      serious pressure on the American administration to halt the enemy's
      massacre and end its protection of Sharon and his terrorist government.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We affirm that our people
      and Mujahid forces would remain loyal to their pledge of persisting in
      Jihad and resistance, defending their lands and holy shrines and remaining
      patient and steadfast for the sake of Allah. We also invite our Nations�
      masses to rescue their brothers in Palestine and beseech them to commence
      practical steps to end that carnage and check its possible spread into
      other areas.<b><u><o:p>

      patient people:<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our enemy is only deterred
      by force and only steadfastness and confrontation would halt its
      aggression. In such difficult moments, we call on all our people's
      forces and factions especially the resistance brigades in the Qassam, Aqsa
      Martyrs, Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa, Quds and elements of the Palestinian
      Authority police and national security to unite their efforts in
      confrontation of the Zionist enemy that is launching an open war. We urge
      them to retaliate to the atrocities in an open confrontation that would
      target all of its leaderships, soldiers and settlers in away that reaches
      the depth of its security.</p>
