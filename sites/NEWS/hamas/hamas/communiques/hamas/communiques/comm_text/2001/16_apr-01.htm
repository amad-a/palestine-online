      on the Zionist aggression against Syrian military positions in Lebanon</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In a serious escalation,
      the Zionist enemy's warplanes pounded a radar position for the Syrian
      forces working in Lebanon leading to the martyrdom of three soldiers and
      the injury of others.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We, in the Islamic
      Resistance Movement, Hamas, condemn this brutal aggression and warn of the
      repercussions of such an escalatory aggressive policy of war criminal
      terrorist Sharon and the possibility of its expansion in more than one
      direction in the region.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Today's aggression
      against the Syrian forces comes in continuation of the enemy's
      arrogance, aggressions and daily massacres against our unarmed people in
      Palestine. Murder, cold-blooded assassinations, damaging lands,
      demolishing houses, displacing their inhabitants, besieging cities and
      starving their inhabitants have turned into a daily practice for Sharon
      and his terrorist gang.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Zionist arrogance and
      crimes are covered with absolute backing on the part of the American
      administration, which gave Sharon a free hand and a green light. This
      aggression also continues and escalates amidst a meager Arab position that
      did not live up to the challenge confronting our Nation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We express our great anger
      due to the official Arab position that stands idle in face of the
      enemy's massacres against our people and remains content with betting on
      the American role and the so-called peace process with the criminal enemy.
      Some of the Arabs even maintain contacts and meetings with terrorist
      Sharon at a time when his hands are still smeared with our children's
      blood. Doesn�t that weak Arab stance lure Sharon into persisting in his
      aggressions and crimes?!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist danger does
      not only threaten our Palestinian people but the whole Arab and Islamic
      Nation. Sharon's threats do not have any limit, he threatens Jordan
      considering it the alternative homeland (for the Palestinians) and one of
      his ministers threatens to flatten the High Dam in Egypt with missiles.
      This is how they treat countries signing peace treaties with them, how
      would they treat other Arab and Islamic countries?!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We appeal to the Arab and
      Islamic governments and peoples to defend with pride their dignity, their
      very existence and destiny. They must shoulder their responsibility in
      repelling the Zionist aggression and must support and defend our people in
      Palestine. They should back the steadfast brothers in Syria and Lebanon
      for the enemy is one, the danger is one and the fate is one. Let the
      Nation stand united in face of aggression. Let the Nation affirm that it
      will always remain a Nation of Jihad, steadfastness and challenge � for
      this is the only road to victory and liberation Insha�allah.</p>
