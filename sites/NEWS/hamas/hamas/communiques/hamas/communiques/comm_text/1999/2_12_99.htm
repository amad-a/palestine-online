      deep concern and anger, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) learned of
      the assault by gunfire against Dr. Muaweya al-Masri in Nablus of the West
      Bank, which threatened his life. This cowardly attempt is directly and
      plainly linked to the statement issued by a number of national figures
      criticizing the corruption that is widespread among Palestinian Authority
      circles and its destructive consequences on our Palestinian society, and
      rejecting the policy of relinquishment and abandonment of our People's
      rights and land through negotiations with the Zionist Enemy.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">While
      we condemn this crime, we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for
      it because of the suppressive spheres it has created and its shriveling
      reactions, including the threatening of those who signed the statement. We
      consider this an attempt to terrify and silence those who oppose it and
      also an attempt to prevent them from exposing facts concerning the conduct
      of the PA, its corruption and relinquishments.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">What
      the PA did when it gathered its subjects, employees and members of its
      security bodies to stage ceremonial rallies, when it pushed the
      Legislative Council to condemn some of its members who signed the
      statement and when it threatened them in order to protect its reputation
      reveals that this Authority is fragile and lacks credibility. It also
      reflects the gap between the Authority and the ambitions of our People and
      their popular opinion.<o:p>

      those who oppose the peace process and who call for reformation, we call
      upon the PA to reconsider its policies and accounts, to treat the
      corruption within its ranks and to put an end to the policy of
      relinquishments instead of insisting on its mistakes.<o:p>
