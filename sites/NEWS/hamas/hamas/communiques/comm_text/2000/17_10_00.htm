      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">A responsible source in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) stated
      the following on results of the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The results and resolutions of the summit meeting have adequately proved
      that we, along with our Palestinian people and Nation, were right in
      refusing such a summit and rejecting participation of the Palestinian
      Authority and other Arab parties in it. The summit was held for the sake
      of aborting the blessed popular Intifadha, return of the security
      coordination between the enemy's government and the PA and the return
      anew to the absurd negotiating table. The results came as the American
      administration and the Zionist enemy wished and re-affirmed that the
      summit's target was not for the interest of our people who offered more
      than 100 martyrs and more than 4,000 wounded but rather to save the
      government of Barak and to boost Clinton's administration in the peak of
      the American elections battle.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">As far as the details are concerned the PA demands were bypassed, despite
      their low tune and concentration on formal procedures, while the Zionist
      viewpoint was imposed due to American bias and pressures, which had drawn
      three goals for the summit that were imposed on the Palestinian party and
      which the summit adopted through its three resolutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">In the light of what happened we, in the Hamas Movement, declare our
      stands as following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>First:</b> We declare our rejection of all results of that summit. We
      consider that our people, including its political forces and nationalist,
      Islamic figures, were not represented in that summit and hence we and our
      people would not abide by its resolutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Second:</b> We affirm that the Aqsa Intifadha did not break out for
      the sake of partial demands but rather to defeat occupation on our lands
      and sanctities and to attain our full rights. Occupation is the reason of
      all evil and our people's sufferings, wounds and pains. We, along with
      our all forces of our people, are determined to continue the Intifadha
      until it achieves its goals Allah willing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Third:</b> We condemn and denounce the American flagrant biased stand
      in favor of the Zionist enemy. We call on the Arab countries in their
      forthcoming summit conference not to heed the American position or the
      ill-fated Sharm Al-Sheikh summit. We ask them to side by the Palestinian
      and Arab-Islamic masses� option that of persisting along the road of
      struggle and popular intifadha until occupation is defeated.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>Fourth:</b> We urge our Palestinian people to continue their blessed
      Intifadha and to foil the Sharm Al-Sheikh resolutions in practice. Let all
      our people's forces unite along the road of all-out confrontation
      against occupation, for this is the real road of national unity. We appeal
      to our Arab and Islamic Nation's masses to continue their popular
      programs in support of the Aqsa Intifadha and to continue demanding their
      governments to keep in harmony with such an option and reject the Sharm
      Al-Sheikh resolutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Fifth: We ask the PA to side by our people and Nation's choice, which
      is resistance and popular Intifadha. If the PA had committed a grave
      mistake through participation in the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit we hope that
      it would not go farther in its mistake by implementing the ominous summit
      resolutions or else it will be the loser in the end and out of our
      people's national consensus.<b><o:p>
