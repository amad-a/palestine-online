      aims at achieving an accomplishment namely closing the file of the
      Palestine cause and reaching a framework agreement for a final peace
      settlement between the PA and the Zionist enemy�s government in a bid to
      end the struggle in the region before expiry of Clinton�s term in

      Camp David summit targets concluding a framework agreement on issues of
      the final status of the occupied Palestinian lands in 1967 while
      indefinitely postponing any agreement on details of those issues. Such a
      step would entail new and serious Palestinian concessions that would close
      the file of the Palestine cause. It would also lead to ending the struggle
      with the Zionist entity and open the doors wide-open for Zionist
      penetration of the Arab and Islamic region and normalization of relations.
      Barak had forestalled this summit by announcing his five Nos clearly
      pinpointing his government�s stands. Those are: no return to the pre 5
      June 1967 borders, no division of Al-Quds (Jerusalem), no to the right of
      return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland, no to dismantling of
      settlements, no to presence of any other army than the Zionist one in
      Palestine. As for the PA, it declared its demands of implementing the
      remaining articles of the transitional stage and its intention to declare
      the Palestinian state on 13 September.</font></p>

      the Zionist aggressor heads to that summit armed with those red lines and
      a public opinion rejecting to grant our people their rights, the PA goes
      to the summit carrying the illusion of the American role and stripped of
      any popular support. The PA is rather carrying the burden of quelling the
      loyal forces and Mujahideen of our people. It goes to the summit with
      actual readiness to offer dangerous concessions that apparently had been
      already approved or showed signs of approval during secret rounds of
      negotiations in Stockholm and others.</font></p>

      self-rule Authority, realizing that it had already wasted a lot of rights
      and bypassed basic principles, will seek to cover up any concession via a
      big deception campaign directed to our people along with the Arab and
      Islamic Nation. It will attempt to highlight the declaration of the state
      as the real victory and the most wanted wish or aspiration. Thus it would
      be ignoring our people�s will, hopes and preparedness to sacrifice and
      it would jump over decades of Jihad and sacrifice.</font></p>

      started in Madrid and Oslo and would only end in total surrender and
