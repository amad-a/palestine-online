      passed by and the blessed month of Ramadan again shone its lights carrying
      with it great meanings and concepts that form values of Islamic life. It
      is the month honored by Allah with the descent of the holy Quran in which
      the link between Heaven and Earth has been achieved through such heavenly
      constitution that lightened the way for humanity towards a life of virtue
      and safety.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-kashida: 0%; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Ramadan
      reminds the Ummah of the necessity of returning to its religion and Quran
      so as to bypass the stage of backwardness, ignorance and tragedies
      befalling it. Ramadan is a great opportunity to refuel Jihad into this
      Ummah and the Mujahideen in their continued civilization struggle with
      enemies of Allah and the Ummah: the Zionists who are spreading corruption
      on the land of Palestine and destroying human and greenery life. They are
      committing massacres, shelling houses and killing in cold-blood the brave
      Palestinians who are facing the Zionist war machine with bare chests that
      are full of belief and confidence in Allah�s victory. Those Palestinians
      are insistent on continuing the blessed intifada until defeat of
      occupation, liberation of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and return of our
      Palestinian people to the holy land of Palestine from which they were
      forcibly expelled and displaced in the four corners of the Earth.<o:p>

      the advent of the month of victories and conquers and on the eve of the
      international day for solidarity with the Palestinian people, the holy
      Aqsa intifada enters its third consecutive month, more solid in
      confrontation with the Zionist enemy and its terrorist and repressive
      means. The intifada enters its third month while our patient people are
      suffering from tightened siege and more terrorism and liquidation of
      Mujahideen. They are also facing numerous forms of savagery such as
      destruction of installations and lands, uprooting of trees and blockage of
      roads. However, such a situation did not weaken the intifada or our
      people�s determination and insistence on persisting along the road of
      Jihad and struggle and protecting the intifada from any deviations in its
      capacity as our Mujahid people�s option. The intifada continued, despite
      escalation of Zionist terrorism, its normal development inflicting
      casualties and losses in lines of the occupation soldiers and settlers and
      spreading panic in the heart of the Zionist entity. We hail, in this
      respect, the heroic Khadera operation and all Jihad and armed operations
      that preceded and followed it.<o:p>

      The Movement affirms the continuation of the holy Aqsa intifada and
      escalation of resistance against the enemy with all means. It urges the

      The Movement asserts that the cowardly assassination attempts perpetrated
      by the Zionist enemy among the victims of which were Qassam commander
      Ibrahim Bani Odeh, who is the holder of an honorable Jihad record in face
      of enemies to Allah and the Ummah, the five Hamas martyrs in Qalqilya and
      two strugglers from Fatah Movement along with other revolting Palestinians
      from various forces and Islamic and national forces would not weaken our
      determination, belief or solidity in face of the Zionist enemy. The
      assassinations open the door wide open for confronting and eliminating
      collaborators and traitors. We call on the Mujahideen and strugglers in
      addition to all our people to be careful of the enemy and its agents�
      attempts to unsettle the Palestinian arena via numerous and mean methods.<o:p>

      developing it on the basis of Jihad and resistance against the Zionist
      enemy in addition to protecting such unity in a way ensuring safety of the
      Palestinian arena and guaranteeing persistence of the blessed intifada.
      Here we would like to insist on the importance of releasing all our
      brothers the Mujahideen detained in jails of the Palestinian Authority for
      our people detest such detention, express its rejection of it and demand

      The Movement confirms its rejection of returning to the option of
      negotiating with the enemy. Hamas considers that such an option reneges on
      our people�s will represented in insistence on resistance and intifada
      and absolute rejection of the oppressive settlement option. Thus Hamas
      affirms that our people would not accept all tabled initiatives and all
      secret and open meetings with the enemy, which displays yearning to Oslo
      and its hateful results.<o:p>

      appreciates the Fatwa (edict) passed by the Mufti of Egypt and Sheikh

      goods. It also appreciates the Fatwa passed by the Kuwaiti house of Fatwa
