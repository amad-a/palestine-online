      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">A responsible source in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, commented
      on the meeting of the Palestinian Central council (PCC) in the period 2-3
      July 2000 by saying:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">Despite the fact that the establishment of a really sovereign Palestinian
      state on Palestinian lands was a national demand of all Palestinians, yet
      regretfully the Palestinian Authority (PA) has turned that demand into a
      mere slogan after the Oslo agreements. The PA maneuvers with that slogan
      in accordance with developments of the meager negotiations with the
      Zionist enemy whether in the transitional stage negotiations or the
      so-called final status talks.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">Results of the latest PCC meeting came in harmony with that fact since
      the decision of declaring the state was left to the Palestinian
      leadership, in response to its pressures, so that it can use such a
      decision as a bargaining card to win the remaining bits and pieces of the
      transitional stage.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">The apparent rigidity in statements of both the Palestinian and Zionist
      parties is apparently a mere fabrication to prepare the public opinion for
      future steps that include concessions and surrendering of our people's
      rights and sovereignty.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">The American administration's total biased stand in favor of the
      Zionists, including the rejection of the declaration of the Palestinian
      state, affirms that the American administration cannot be depended upon in
      ensuring justice for our people or realizing their rights.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">If the PA was really serious in not giving up Palestinian rights topped
      by Jerusalem, the refugees and establishment of the independent state,
      then it should announce its withdrawal from the absurd negotiations with
      the Zionist enemy. It also must return to the Palestinian people's
      option in resisting and defeating occupation. The PA ought to end its
      persecution of the Mujahideen and terminate its protection of the
      occupiers. Finally it should not rein in our people's potentials in
      resisting occupation.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><font face="Times New Roman">The Hamas Movement re-affirms that Jihad, struggle, patience and
      sacrifice constitute the road towards liberating our lands and grabbing
      our rights. The experience, of the brave resistance and its victory, in
      South Lebanon is strong evidence that rights are only grabbed by Jihad and
      bloodletting and not begged at the negotiating and bargaining tables. We
      call on our Arab and Muslim Nation, on the official and popular levels, to
      support resistance on the land of Palestine in its capacity as the
      Nation's choice to realize liberation and victory similar to the
      Lebanese experience where the people along with the government and the
      whole country embraced the resistance option.</font></p>
