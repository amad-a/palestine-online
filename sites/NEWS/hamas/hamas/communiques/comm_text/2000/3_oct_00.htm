      army continues to wage its all-out war against our unarmed people using
      all kinds of weapons: tanks, helicopter gunship, missiles, machineguns and
      bombs in a bid to terrorize our people and compel them by force to accept
      continuation of Zionist occupation of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and Jewish
      sovereignty over the Aqsa in preparation for establishing the alleged
      temple in its place. The savage Zionist Jewish crimes are clearly evident
      in the image of the martyr child Mohammed Jamal Al-Durra who was murdered
      by the enemy soldiers in cold bold. They did not have mercy on his
      innocent childhood, hence came the terrifying scene that shook the whole
      world. On the other hand, our proud people continue to resist the
      occupation army, the government of criminal Barak and the herds of
      settlers. The Palestinians continue to defend their lands, holy shrines,
      Al-Quds, the Aqsa, religion, honor and Arab and Islamic dignity. Our
      people prove once again that they are a people of heroic deeds and
      sacrifice, a people of Jihad and martyrdom, a people of martyrs and that
      their sacrifice for the sake of the Aqsa was boundless.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">More than fifty martyrs and 1,500 wounded fell in the Aqsa Intifadha,
      which broke out in all areas of our occupied Palestinian lands uniting the
      blood of our people in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem with that
      of our heroic steadfast people in our occupied Palestinian lands in 1948.
      The battlefield united our people with all their layers, trends, factions
      and forces in the holy Aqsa�s Intifadha, for the enemy is one ... the
      destiny is one � and the blood is one.</p>

      Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed"><b>First: on the internal Palestinian level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">1- The Movement stresses unity of the Palestinian people in their
      continued confrontations and resistance against the Zionist enemy through
      the holy Aqsa�s Intifadha. That uprising that came in retaliation to the
      savage massacres committed and still are committed by the enemy in the
      holy Aqsa�s yards and in all occupied Palestinian cities and villages
      including our occupied lands in 1948. The Movement salutes our martyrs and
      wounded in various areas of our holy land and hails their families and
      relatives affirming Hamas� backing to them all.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- The demand for resignation of the chairman of the Palestinian
      Authority did not reflect the Movement�s stand nor its policy. The
      Movement affirms that it works for the liberation of our lands, our Quds
      and our Aqsa with all our people in a liberation march from the usurping
      enemy and for the sake of the return of our lands and country.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- We call on our people in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the 48 areas
      and in each and every city and village, camp and alley to continue the
      confrontations and to escalate them against the Zionist enemy and to
      resist the settlers and defend the Aqsa and guard it with our lives and
      money and not to allow an end to this Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- We demand the Palestinian Authority to immediately set free all
      political detainees and Mujahideen in its jails topped by Dr. Abdul Aziz
      Ranteesi, Dr. Ibrahim Makadme, Sheikh Jamal Mansour, Sheikh Mohammed Jamal
      Natshe, Mujahid Mahmoud Abu Hannoud and Mujahid Mohammed Daif.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">5- We renew our salutation to our heroic steadfast people in occupied
      Palestine-1948 for their steadfastness, sacrifices and strong rejection of
      the Jewish conspiracies against the Aqsa and for their blessed Intifadha
      and for their martyrs and hundreds of wounded.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">6- Let the days of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 3,4,5/10 be days of
      escalation and all-out confrontations with the enemy soldiers and herds of
      settlers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">7- In response to the appeal by the Nation�s scholars and leaders of
      Islamic Movements, who expressed solidarity and support with our people:
      let Friday 6/10 be a day of distinctive escalation and clashes. Let
      tumultuous demonstrations march from all mosques in Palestine to reflect
      the Palestinian immense anger towards Zionist massacres. We also request
      from the Friday preachers to allocate the Friday sermon to Al-Quds, the
      Aqsa and our people and Nation�s duty towards them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">8- The Hamas Movement declares that it would shoulder its duty towards
      all families of the martyrs who fell in the Aqsa�s Intifadha through
      catering for them and ensuring that our people would also cater for them
      out of our responsibility towards the blood of martyrs and to preserve
      their families and sons after them.</p>

      in support of Al-Quds and the Aqsa and to express solidarity with our
      stationed people. Let the masses hit the streets in all Arab and Islamic
      capitals to reflect their dismay towards the Zionist carnages and to
      affirm our Nation�s insistence on Al-Quds and the Aqsa and its readiness
      to defend its holy shrines.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- We ask leaders of the Arab and Islamic countries to shoulder their
      duty and responsibility towards Al-Quds and the Aqsa and towards our
      stationed people. We ask them to strengthen their steadfastness and Jihad
      materially and morally. We ask them to allow freedom of expression to the
      Arab and Islamic peoples so that they would express their opinions and
      support their brothers in Palestine. We demand the countries establishing
      relations with the criminal enemy to sever those relations and expel
      ambassadors and representatives of that criminal entity who are
      desecrating Arab lands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- The Hamas Movement lauds our Nation�s masses that took to the
      streets in support of the Aqsa especially our people and brothers in
      Yemen, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. We also hail the Arab and Islamic
      community in Britain, America and Europe and request more such activities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- We call on our Arab and Islamic peoples to contribute in the Aqsa�s
      Intifadha and in the defense of Al-Quds and the sanctities by sharing in
      the honor of Jihad through donating money to our people and their
      certified charitable societies.</p>
