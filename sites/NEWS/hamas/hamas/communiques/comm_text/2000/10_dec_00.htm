      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Facts speak for themselves
      and events affirm our role and Jihad � we were not absent from the arena
      of events as liars claimed. We were always ready to perform our role �
      we struck the enemy on the land and at sea and penetrated all military and
      security blocks. We hoisted our guns and roamed every spot in our homeland
      but did not declare responsibility for many operations that we had
      launched since a new stage in our historic confrontation with the Zionist
      enemy had started that would lose that enemy its mind.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Within that new
      confrontation, we declare responsibility for the Rafah operation one month
      after it took place in addition to other heroic attacks but <b>we reserve
      the right of declaring responsibility for other operations at the
      opportune time.</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>First</b>: The Rafah
      marine operation on Tuesday 7/11/00 in which <b>Mujahid hero Hamdy Arafat
      Ensio</b> was martyred when he blasted a boat loaded with <b>120 kilograms
      of TNT </b>in an Israeli �Dabur� navy vessel at sea destroying it
      completely and killing all on board. The enemy did not declare number of
      casualties or losses suffered in the operation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Second</b>: The heroic
      remote-controlled Khadera blast on 22/11/00 that led to the death of 21
      Israelis and the injury of 65 others.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Third</b>: The heroic
      Kfar Darum operation on 20/11/00, which was launched with the use of an
      explosive device similar to the one that martyred hero commander Awad
      Silmi.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Fourth</b>: Constant
      firing operations in Rafah, Khan Younis, Beit Hanun and the West Bank.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We in the Qassam Brigades
      while bearing the glad tidings of the martyrdom of our hero <b>Hamdy
      Arafat Ensio</b> to the Arab and Islamic Nation and our stationed
      Palestinian people, we would like to affirm that there is no other road
      than that of Jihad and no other alternative than that of resistance. We
      would also like to affirm that we did not and would not give up Jihad and
      would not drop our arms despite persecutions and siege. The fall of one
      martyr after the other would not weaken us or stop our Jihad march or
      prevent our advance towards plucking the Zionist entity off our holy land.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We tell Barak and his
      panicked army, which we vanquished, that we never fear death as you do and
      we never love life as much as you do. We tell him that one day you will
      taste the bitterness of the Qassam swords; we will make you taste death,
      which you always flee from and teach you the horror that you dread. You
      will remember our might when you flee in front of our men's
      determination and when you get entangled in the mud of your blood that
      would be shed by Palestine freedom fighters and guardians of the Aqsa. In
      the coming few days you will see for yourself seriousness of our promises
      and threats.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Good for you the martyrdom
      Hamdy that you have always worked for and we pledge that we will remain
      loyal to you and to your brothers until we meet our fate.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Allahu
