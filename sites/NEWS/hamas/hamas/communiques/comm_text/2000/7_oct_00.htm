      bravery � this was your day � day of rage in which you proved that you
      are worth being the protectors and guardians of the Aqsa. You hoisted up
      high with your blood the flag of Palestine over the Dome of the Rock �
      and you resisted with bare chests the criminal Barak who is ordering the
      killing or our people and insist on his program to judaize Al-Quds
      (Jerusalem) and seize the Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">You are not alone in the battle for Al-Quds and the Aqsa for the Nation,
      the whole Nation stands by your side and yearns for the day of Jihad for
      the sake of liberating Palestine and salvaging the Aqsa. Here it is now
      (the Nation) reflecting its genuineness through the massive demonstrations
      in all Arab and Islamic capitals and wherever its communities reside. Yes
      our Mujahid people, the Aqsa is uniting our people and Nation � here
      they are the Intifadha and struggle uniting us after negotiations and
      settlements divided our people and Nation. Here they are foiling all
      illusionary and humiliating peace with the occupying enemy and here they
      are our people affirming that that there is no way for returning back and
      warning against any attempt to abort the Aqsa Intifadha or exploiting it
      to try and breathe spirit into the dead body of the settlement process!
      That criminal enemy would only submit to the logic of force and
      resistance. Bargaining over the blood of our martyrs will only lead to
      more Zionist arrogance, wasting rights, judaizing Al-Quds and expediting
      the Zionist Jews� attempt to demolish the Aqsa.</p>

      following:<o:p>

      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">1- We call on our Mujahid people to continue the Aqsa Intifadha, escalate
      it and confront enemy soldiers and herds of settlers. We also call for
      breaking the siege on the Aqsa Mosque by heading for prayers in it
      especially on the part of our people in Al-Quds and our people in occupied
      Palestine in 1948.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">2- We hail our people for responding to the Aqsa's appeal and their
      tumultuous demonstrations following the Friday noon prayers in all mosques
      of Palestine, their confrontation of the enemy soldiers and offering 11
      martyrs along with hundreds of wounded. We salute the Mujahid family of
      Shamlakh who offered their second martyr in the Intifadha.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      Palestinian hospitals donating blood for their wounded brothers and
      assisting in treating victims.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      and Mujahideen in its prisons to enable them, each from his position,
      perform their role in that Intifadha and in protecting our people and
      fighting the enemy. Our people have the right of wondering for whose
      interests are those freedom fighters and Mujahideen behind bars of PA
      jails?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      cooperation with the Zionist enemy and end all kinds of meetings with it.</p>

      and their martyrs to our Arab and Islamic masses that hit the streets in
      huge demonstrations and rallies along with prayers in mosques for the
      support of the Aqsa especially in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi
      Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman sultanate, Kuwait,
      Sudan, Iran, Morocco, Algeria, Bahrain, Mauritania, Pakistan, Malaysia and
      Indonesia. We also hail the Arab and Islamic communities and all
      freedom-loving forces in European countries, America and Russia.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      people and protests against Zionist massacres in all Arab and Islamic
      capitals.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">3- We demand that the forthcoming Arab summit be that of the Aqsa, a
      summit for Jihad and resistance, a summit for building a real Arab
      strategy for the sake of defeating the occupiers and purging the Aqsa
      Mosque, Al-Quds and Palestine from them. We do not want it to be a summit
      for issuing condemnation communiques and giving a fresh chance for the
      humiliating peace process.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">4- We call on leaders of the Nation to strengthen steadfastness of our
      people and bolster their Mujahideen in addition to opening the door for
      Jihad to liberate Palestine and allowing the angry masses to express their
      support and solidarity with our people and not to quell them. We denounce
      the crime of killing one of our people in Jordan as a result of using
      force and violence to quell the demonstrators.</p>

      herds of settlers. We advise the throwing arms to develop tools and means
      of their revolt and to use all popular resistance methods stones, Molotov,
      cold arms and pouring oil in roads of enemy vehicles and seeking to
      inflict biggest possible losses in enemy lines.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      writing slogans on walls condemning Zionist massacres and desecration of
      Al-Quds and the Aqsa, and demanding an immediate halt to negotiations and
      continuing Jihad and struggle, and hailing the Arab and Islamic peoples
      who backed our people.</p>
