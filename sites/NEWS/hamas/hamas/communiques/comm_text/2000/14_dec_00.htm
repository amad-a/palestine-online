      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The
      anniversary of victory in Bader this year coincides with the 13<sup>th</sup>
      anniversary of the outbreak of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
      posing as a renewed hope for the upcoming dawn and victory of our people
      Insha�allah. It further affirms that the Jihad option is the only one
      capable of formulating that hopeful victory.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Hence, let
      the holy Aqsa intifada continue and escalate and all hail to those using
      guns and to the Qassam elements who launch declared and undeclared heroic
      operations from Khadera to the martyrdom marine operation off Rafah to
      Kfar Darum to ambushes targeting occupiers all over our homeland. So
      continue along your path O heroes whether declaring or not declaring your
      operations and do not be provoked by those who do not know the truth.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">A proud
      salutation to all martyrs of the blessed intifada and to the Qassam
      martyrs Hamdy Mikdad, Ibrahim Bani Odeh, Awad Silmi and Abbas Iwewi those
      pure and hidden heroes who taught the Nation the road to sacrifice, those
      who vanquished the Zionists.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Our
      stationed Palestinian people</b> � the holy Aqsa intifada had entered a
      new stage through the painful blows against cowardly Zionists and
      frightened settlers everywhere, which made them lose their minds and sense
      that their fragile entity was shaken thanks to strikes of the Mujahideen.
      Hence they lost confidence in their topmost General and his government
      fell down heralding the fall of their state God willing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">We affirm
      that efforts exerted for the sake of returning to the negotiating table
      were but desperate attempts to save the Zionists at the expense of our
      people's intifada, Jihad and blood of martyrs. The biased American
      fact-finding committee was one of those desperate attempts. We do not
      believe it would lead to anything and we believe that in the end it would
      only serve the Zionists� interests.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Our
      Mujahid Palestinian people</b> � the ferocious Zionist offensive point
      to the Generals� despair. The savage storming of Khan Younis refugee
      camp yesterday, the bombing of Beit Jala or the cowardly assassinations
      against our people's heroes are all indications of the failure of the
      Zionist Generals. Such attempts would only boost our people's solidity
      and determination to go ahead along the road of resistance until defeat of
      occupation. So depend on Allah and be patient for the victory in the end
      will be for those who fear Allah.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Our
      Palestinian people � our Arab-Islamic Nation �</b> the Hamas Movement
      while commemorating its 13<sup>th</sup> anniversary would like to affirm
      the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>First: on
      the Palestinian level:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1- Hamas
      urges the Palestinian people to launch more resistance of the occupation
      soldiers and herds of settlers using all available means.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2- Hamas
      affirms the importance of applying the Sharia of Allah against the agent
      Allan Kharyoush who masterminded, along with his Zionist masters, the
      assassination of the Qassam Brigades' commander Ibrahim Bani Odeh. The
      Palestinian people would not accept anything less than executing that
      agent and his like. Hamas further affirms the importance of exposing,
      prosecuting and trying all collaborators, who are spreading corruption, in
      their capacity as the most important tools of occupation in perpetrating
      internal sabotage and committing assassinations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3- The
      Movement stresses the necessity of heading to the Aqsa Mosque despite the
      criminal Zionists� siege and let the last Friday in Ramadan be the day
      of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) to affirm our protection and catering of the holy
      Aqsa.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">4- The
      Movement affirms that there is no justification for retaining political
      detainees in Palestinian Authority jails. This bleeding wound should be
      stopped by releasing them topped by Dr. Abdul Aziz Ranteesi who started a
      hunger strike on Sunday 12.12.00. We request our people to display
      solidarity with him and pressure decision-makers to ensure his release
      along with other political detainees.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">5- We ask our
      people to maintain visits to families of martyrs, detainees and wounded
      especially in this holy month.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">6- The
      Movement asserts the importance of maintaining the boycott of Zionist and
      American goods and setting a certain mechanism to ensure continuation of
      this matter and abidance of all.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">7- We salute
      our brothers in Palestine occupied in 1948 and urge those who serve in the
      occupation army, which killed their families and brothers in all
      Palestine, to withdraw from this army and return to the embraces of their
      people who are struggling to get rid of that occupation. The Movement
      appreciates efforts by certain Druze figures in the Galilee towards that
      end and call for supporting them in a way that would enhance our national
      unity and cohesion in face of occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">8- Hamas
      greets our heroic detainees in Zionist occupation prisons and vows never
      to forget them or be content until their release. On this occasion we hail
      our brothers the Mujahideen in Hizbullah and its secretary general Sheikh
      Hassan Nasrallah for his insistence on releasing all detainees and
      prisoners in the Zionist occupation prisons.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Second: on
      the Arab and Islamic levels:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">1- Hamas
      calls on the Arab and Islamic peoples to retain the state of solidarity
      with the Palestinian people in a way coping with continuation and
      escalation of the intifada.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">2- Hamas
      urges the Arab and Islamic peoples to extend more material and moral aid
      to our patient people to strengthen their determination and intifada.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">3- Hamas asks
      all Arab and Islamic peoples to pray on Lailatul Qadr and the last ten
      days of Ramadan for the victory of our people and defeat of our enemies
      the Zionists.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Third:
      activities:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Hamas calls
      on its members, supporters and all Palestinians to abide by the struggle
      and Jihad program issued by the national and Islamic committees and
      affirms importance of continuation of marches of rage especially following
      the Friday noon congregations and let the grounds turn into fire under the
      feet of the Zionist occupiers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b>Allahu
