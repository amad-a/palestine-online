      surprised our people and Nation with its approval to attend the Sharm
      Al-Sheikh summit with the criminal terrorist Barak at a time the blood of
      more than 100 martyrs along with four thousand wounded did not dry yet,
      those who fell in the holy Aqsa Intifadha in defense of our lands and
      sanctities. We, in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, faced by such a
      serious decision would like to affirm the following:<o:p>

      We condemn the PA's approval to attend the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit and
      consider it a serious indifference towards the blood of martyrs and
      wounded who shed their blood on the ground of Palestine and the Aqsa. We
      also consider such a decision as a flagrant disdain of our Mujahid
      people's feelings who are still resisting occupation and confronting its
      suppression, tyranny and terrorism. It also represented a scornful act in
      face of our Arab, Islamic Nations� masses that have reacted and still
      are reacting with our people's Intifadha in an unprecedented manner.<o:p>

      the PA's approval to attend that ill-fated summit came at a time when
      the enemy soldiers and settlers� crimes were escalating at the orders of
      Barak. This PA step would frustrate our people's feelings who are eager
      for Jihad and resistance in addition to our Nation's feelings. It
      further serves the enemy's goal of quelling the Aqsa Intifadha.<o:p>

embed"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Third:</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">
      The approval to attend that summit without any prior conditions as Barak
      and Clinton wished points to the extent of dictates and humiliating
      solutions imposed on the Palestinian party, which had already retreated
      from its conditions before the convening of the summit so how would it act
      on the table of dictates!?<o:p>

      The holding of that ill-fated summit prior to the date of the Arab summit
      certainly means foiling the Arab summit's goals in addition to carrying
      negative impact on its resolutions.<o:p>

      We affirm the continuation of the Intifadha against the criminal enemy and
      call on our people to continue the march of Jihad and struggle in defense
      of our land, rights and sanctities and out of loyalty to blood of martyrs
      and wounded. We also urge our angry Arab, Islamic masses that supported
      our people and strongly backed the Aqsa and resistance to continue their
      role and solidarity with our people and the Aqsa. We request them not to
      give attention to the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit and whatever it could pass of
      decisions that do not represent the Palestinian people and do not reflect
      stands and feelings of the live Arab, Islamic peoples.<o:p>

      We understand the attempt by some PA officials to charge the Hamas
      Movement with inciting certain events in Gaza Strip as a clear attempt to
      justify tightening the noose round the Hamas Movement and re-detaining its
      leaders and cadres who were released by the angry masses. The statements
      also served as a cover-up for the PA's serious decision to attend that
      summit and an aborted attempt to preoccupy our people and our Movement in
      side battles away from our role alongside our people in resisting the
      criminal enemy.<o:p>

      We call on our brothers in the Fatah Movement to continue their role in
      the Intifadha and popular confrontations against occupation and not to
      heed the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit but rather to urge the PA not to
      participate in it.<o:p>
