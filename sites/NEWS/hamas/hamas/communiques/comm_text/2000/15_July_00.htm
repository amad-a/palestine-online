      convening of the Camp David summit in the American capital grouping US
      president Bill Clinton, prime minister of the Zionist enemy Ehud Barak and
      head of the Palestinian Authority (PA) Yasser Arafat, leads the Palestine
      cause to a very serious stage that it never experienced over its history.</font></p>

      doubt Arafat�s Authority is largely responsible for deterioration of the
      Muslims� central cause. However, this does not mean that Muslims are not
      involved in that sin if they remain silent towards surrendering the holy
      land and the first Qibla to grandsons of the monkeys and pigs.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-kashida: 0%; text-indent: 9.05pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman">The
      Ummah has passed through times of weakness during which its enemies such
      as the crusades, the moguls and others had the upper hand but he Ummah,
      despite its weakness, never recognized what the usurpers had occupied of
      Muslim land. The Ummah remained pending hopes on an end to the period of
      weakness and a return of Jihad to uproot the usurpers. One such example
      was the Hitteen battle in which the hero Salahuddin was able to wipe out
      crusade armies and managed to liberate most of Sham areas and restored Al-Quds
      (Jerusalem) to Islamic sovereignty after a hundred years of crusade
      occupation. When the Ummah was weak again in face of the moguls, capital
      of the caliphate rule Baghdad fell in their hands along with other Islamic
      cities. However, the Ummah did not give up and two other leaders Dhaher
      Beybars and Qutuz were able to defeat the moguls in the battle of Ein
      Galout on the land of Palestine.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 9.05pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman">The
      Ummah�s current weakness, during which those on whom the wrath of Allah
      is ordained have seized a part of Muslim land that is dear to hearts of
      all Muslims and established on it their alleged entity, is nonetheless a
      temporary period. It does not mean that the Ummah should accept solutions
      endorsing the Zionists� rights on the land of Palestine as the
      negotiations in Camp David now target. The excuse that the PA represents
      the Palestinian people and that its decision was theirs is a kind of
      evasion from responsibility and an unacceptable pretext. Events have
      proven that Arafat�s Authority only represented a limited section of the
      Palestinians and acted in accordance with personal interests along with
      American and Zionist pressures that made it ready to give up the
      Palestinian people�s rights in their country and lands. That Authority
      further served as the persecutor of the living popular forces who are
      insisting on the Jihad and resistance option. It also worked for
      corrupting the Palestinian people�s moral values and spreading indecency
      in their lines.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 9.05pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman">Hence,
      any agreement concluded by that Authority with the Zionist enemy is null
      and void for that Authority represents only itself. Our right in our land
      and sanctities will remain solid regardless of the lapse of time and of
      heavy sacrifices.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 9.05pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman">We
      ask the Muslim Ummah, especially the Islamic movements, groups and
      parties, to shoulder the responsibility towards that sacred cause. They
      should all check that Authority�s concessions and should warn it against
      repercussions of capitulation. They should also voice out loud such a
      stance whether through issuing communiques, organizing angry
      demonstrations, torching Zionist flags and condemning the Authority�s
      humiliating stands through speeches and lectures. They further should
      declare insistence on Al-Quds, with both its western and eastern sectors,
      as a sacred Islamic city that was and will remain for the Ummah of Isra�
      not for the killers of prophets. They also should declare their rejection
      of the American-Zionist conspiracy that is currently being hatched in Camp
      David and refuse its consequences. They must genuinely support
      steadfastness of the Palestinian people and their Jihad movements to
      restore the rights, abort the Zionist project and purge the sanctities
      from the dirt of Jewish occupation.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 9.05pt; margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font face="Times New Roman">That
      is the least the Ummah should do out of its duty towards Palestine so that
      Al-Quds would not be judaized, the Aqsa demolished, the Azan silenced, the
      star of David hoisted over the lands of Palestine and the jews allowed to
      penetrate all Islamic countries.</font></p>
