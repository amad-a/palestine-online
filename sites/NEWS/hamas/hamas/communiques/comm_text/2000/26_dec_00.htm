      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">�Among
      the Believers are men who have been true to their Covenant with Allah: of
      them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some (still)
      wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least�

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">To
      our Mujahid people � to the freedom loving people on the land of Isra�
      &amp; Mi�rage ... to the foreheads that swore not to bow to Zionists ...
      to the towering rocks of sacrifice � to the resistance gun that never
      softens � we in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, congratulate our
      dignified people on the occasion of Eid ul-Fitr. This Eid befalls us while
      we daily suffer the pain of witnessing funerals of our martyrs so that our
      smiles are mixed with our tears in a clear united stand towards the
      steadfastness and resistance option. This people receive the Eid with
      smiles of resoluteness declaring each day that they will never sway from
      their pledge and that the blood that runs in the veins of our blessed land
      of Palestine will continue to throw fire at the Zionists.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">The
      holy month of Ramadan has gone after witnessing our determination to
      continue along the project of holy Jihad and resistance against the sinful
      Zionist arrogance. The holy Aqsa intifada is steadily progressing along
      the road of daily distinctive escalation. Thus it affirms the people's
      strategy of struggle despite all feverish attempts to restore life to the
      desperate negotiating process via absurd rounds of negotiations in
      Washington and in a bid to save the Zionist mass murderer Barak from his
      political ordeal without gaining any national interest in return. Here we
      affirm anew that such attempts and efforts will not bear fruit in ending
      the blessed intifada and will not stand in face of our patient people's
      anger who swore to grab their legitimate rights with pride.<o:p>

      The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, extends its best wishes to our
      Arab and Islamic peoples on the occasion of the blessed Eid ul-Fitr
      praying that Allah would accept from all of us our Ta�at and many happy
      returns of the occasion.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">2-
      Hamas greets and appreciates our Islamic and Arab peoples that expressed
      their real solidarity with our just cause through the Quds Day activities
      in the last Friday of Ramadan and we hail their supportive stance of the
      blessed intifada.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">3-
      Hamas appeals to the beloved Islamic and Arab masses to increase their
      supportive acts of the blessed intifada and organize various activities in
      backing of the Palestinian people in face of the invading occupiers.<o:p>

      support Jihad and to reject normalization and negotiations.<o:p>

      The Movement salutes all Mujahideen who insist on the weapons of right,
      force and freedom and who continue holding their guns declaring
      continuation of the method of Jihad. All hail to our brothers who won the
      honor of martyrdom in the battles of honor in defense of the Nation. Our
      salutations also to our brave detainees who are in the limelight and we
      specifically point to the lions who are engaged in the battle of empty
      stomachs since last Tuesday in the central Junaid prison in Nablus and we
      hold the Palestinian Authority the responsibility of any harm done to any
      of the on-strike Mujahideen.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">2-
      Hamas highly appreciates the daily popular marches that sweep the streets
      of Palestine rejecting the defeatist option and proving their rejection of
      negotiations with the criminal killers. We also cable our best greetings
      to our masses that expressed their backing to the Movement in its carnival
      on the anniversary of its outbreak along with that of the earlier intifada
      in a frank public referendum.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">3-
      Hamas demands an end to all forms of negotiations with the occupiers and
      warns against going back to an option that was a proven failure in the
      past days and that the people had rejected on more than one occasion.
      Hence we declare our refusal to any bargaining on Al-Quds, the Aqsa, the
      Buraq or the refugees for it is a Quranic issue in which our great Quran
      had decided and no-one has the right to negotiate. Any agreement falling
      in this framework does not bind our people or us. The Movement warns in
      this respect against accepting the American proposals that contradict our
      people's stable interests and rights and only serves Barak and Clinton.<o:p>

      Hamas urges the Authority to release all Mujahideen, thinkers and
      religions scholars from its prisons since there is no reason for their
      detention and so that they could enjoy Eid with their sons and relatives
      topped by Dr. Abdul Aziz Ranteesi and Sheikh Mohammed Jamal Natshe.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">6-

      wounded and detainees and to deepen ties with them especially on the days
      of Eid.<o:p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><font face="Times New Roman">7-
      Hamas calls on our Palestinian people to maintain real unity, a unity that
      would unite ranks in face of usurpers for there should be a form of
      political, economic and social cohesion so that we would remain in support
      of each other.<o:p>

      Hamas beseeches our beloved people in Al-Quds and its surroundings and all
      those capable of reaching the Aqsa yards to offer Eid prayers at the holy
      Aqsa Mosque to deny the Jews the joy of evacuating the Mosque from its
      soldiers.<o:p>

      Hamas affirms the activities included in the national and Islamic
      committees� communiques in various areas of our beloved Palestine,
      which would deepen the concept of unity in the goals and means.<o:p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, we in the Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, vow to preserve Allah's Message, Religion and Quran and
      to protect sanctities regardless of sacrifices. We pray that this Eid
      would rekindle the unity over the path of Jihad and resistance on all
      levels. We pray that the next Eid would witness the liberation of our
      lands from usurpers� dirt. May Allah accept your prayers and fasting.</font><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p>
