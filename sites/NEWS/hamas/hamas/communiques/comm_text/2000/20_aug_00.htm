      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Ever
      since the Zionist Dennis Rohan committed his crime on Thursday 21 August
      1969 and Zionist Jewish spite against the Aqsa Mosque was growing and
      hoping to destroy the whole lot of it after the fire destroyed most of
      Salahuddin pulpit, which was installed after liberating Al-Quds from 90
      years of crusade occupation in 1187AD. Incidents are accelerating these
      days and that acceleration bears dangers against the Aqsa Mosque as the
      Jewish threats and violation of its sanctity increase and as Jewish
      elevation daily grows to the extent that it is about to assume power in
      the strongest state on earth. Furthermore, calls are voiced out loud
      calling for demolishing the Aqsa and building the alleged temple in its
      place!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Tomorrow
      falls The anniversary of that ugly crime to remind Muslims with what
      happened to their Mosque and the possible destruction that could target
      it, God forbid, in the event silence towards our enemies� conspiracies
      persisted. During the recent Camp David summit�s discussions, the
      enemy�s premier Ehud Barak demanded the establishment of a Jewish
      synagogue inside the holy Aqsa Mosque�s yards. Furthermore, the so
      called high rabbinate council in the Zionist entity discussed on Monday 7
      August the possibility of establishing that synagogue and decided to
      postpone the debate and not canceling it!!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">In
      a serious development, members of the �Temple Mount Trustees�
      accompanied by other fanatic Jews tried to enter the Aqsa Mosque through
      Bab Al-Maghareba on Thursday 10 August. They marched in tumultuous
      demonstrations chanting anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans. They demanded
      the construction of their alleged temple in place of the Aqsa Mosque on
      the anniversary of what they consider the destruction of the two temples,
      which fell on that same day. They carried the foundation stone of what
      they called their temple and washed it in Ein Silwan while reiterating,
      �Bring down the Mosque over their (Muslim) heads�!! Meanwhile,
      severity of the Jewish rabbis� statements calling for leveling the Aqsa
      Mosque was increasing in an unprecedented manner. In late last July rabbi
      Abraham Shabeer, who was the Zionist entity�s chief Ashkenazi (Western
      Jews) rabbi and who is currently the biggest source of Jewish edicts, said
      in a ceremony organized to lay down the foundation stone of a religious
      school in the presence of ministers, �There is nothing called the Aqsa
      Mosque. This is a lie fabricated by the Arabs and they believed
      themselves. Regretfully some of us also believed them.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">He
      added, �There is no way for deception here for the Temple Mount (The
      Aqsa Mosque) is the property of the Jews and the Jewish people in their
      Diaspora. It is not becoming of the state, which represents the Jewish
      people, to give up this place.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">To
      couple the stand of the chief rabbi of the western Jews, the chief rabbi
      of the eastern Jews Ovadia Yossef, also the chief rabbi of the Shas party,
      advocated similar stands. In the past few days he condemned presence of
      Arabs in Al-Quds describing them as snakes and animals. He even attributed
      lies to almighty Allah by saying that every day Allah �regrets� that
      he created the Arabs as written in the Talmud �because they are evil
      doers and hate Israel.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">In
      line with the accelerating campaigns to judaize the city, mayor of the
      so-called Jerusalem municipality Ehud Ulmert said on 9 August that
      �After 33 years of preventing Jews to practice their right of prayers in
      the Aqsa, today work must be done to actualize that right.� Ulmert had
      recently opened a tunnel connecting the Ma�aleh Adomim settlement to the
      Hebrew University during which he announced the annexation of that
      settlement to Al-Quds!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Falling
      in line with such growing dangers engulfing our captured Mosque, there is
      the American administration�s position topped by the US president�s
      call for moving his country�s embassy to Al-Quds. There is also his
      statement during the Camp David summit in which he affirmed that most
      Christians in the world believed that the Aqsa Mosque was in fact the
      Temple Mount, displaying total bias to the Jewish viewpoint in this
      matter. He was also trying to affect the international public opinion into
      accepting judaization of Islamic sanctities with the blessing of a
      superpower.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Our
      fears, worries and concern over fate of the Aqsa and Al-Quds are doubled
      with recent Arafat�s statements after his return from Camp David in
      which he openly gave up the Buraq Wall to the Jews claiming they had the
      right to praying at that wall.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Our
      Palestinian people ... our Arab and Islamic Nation:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">We
      in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on the anniversary of the
      burning of the blessed Aqsa Mosque would like to explain and affirm the
      following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>First:
      </b>The so-called settlement negotiations with the Zionist enemy are
      nothing but capitulation talks and an umbrella to give up rights. At
      present those negotiations are drawing the final episode of the conspiracy
      against our people and Nation through which most of the blessed
      Palestinian lands are surrendered along with the Muslims� right of
      owning Al-Quds. Furthermore, the refugees� right of return is being
      obliterated. Confronting the various stages of the Camp David conspiracy
      should top the list of duties and responsibilities. Such a stance also
      necessitates exposing all capitulators regardless of their positions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Second</b>:
      We call on the Palestinian Authority to end the capitulation talks with
      the enemy and return to the people�s option that of steadfastness and
      struggle to grab our rights, protect our sanctities and defeat occupation
      since the enemy only understands the language of force while that of
      begging only boosts its arrogance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Third</b>:
      We urge the Nation�s religious scholars to be at the forefront of the
      lines in face of the Zionist danger and to spread awareness among the
      Muslim masses about that enemy�s aggressive plots against the Muslims�
      first Qibla, site of our prophet�s ascension to the heavens and third
      mosque that should be visited in Islam.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Fourth</b>:
      We appeal to leaders of intellect, parties, movements, Arab and Islamic
      forces, popular and syndicate bodies and all civilian institutions to
      assume their role in resisting the Zionist danger and exposing its
      dimensions. They should confront challenges equipped with determination
      and active moves in various arenas including spreading public awareness
      and organizing popular rallies to reflect the Nation�s real stand
      towards Al-Quds and the Aqsa Mosque. Let the governments and regimes
      listen to the masses� voices and conscience in face of Clinton and
      Barak�s threats.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Fifth</b>:
      We ask leaders of the Arab and Islamic countries along with the
      Organization of Islamic Conference and the Arab League to shoulder their
      responsibilities and duties towards Palestine, Al-Quds and the Aqsa
      Mosque. We ask them to support the steadfastness of our people and their
      living forces that insist on the Nation�s rights and defend its
      sanctities. We finally ask them to adopt the Jihad and struggle option to
      seize our rights and prepare our Nation�s peoples to live up to the
      level of struggle and challenge with that hideous enemy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><b>Let
      our people head tomorrow Monday to Al-Quds on the anniversary of the big
      crime to gather and pray at the Aqsa Mosque</b> and let all Muslim masses
      move in support of its great Mosque, the symbol of their pride, honor and
      dignity before it is too late and before the Nation bewails the third
      holiest shrine after the Grand Mosque and the Prophet Mosque. Let all rise
      up in support of our people�s steadfastness in Al-Quds and its
      surroundings. Let all declare in loud voices their rejection of bargaining
      on one inch of our pure Quds� soil and let all voice up high calls for
      ending the comic peace negotiations aimed at surrendering our holy
      shrines.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Let
      the whole world know that wiping out, demolishing or attacking the Aqsa
      Mosque would only be possible over the skulls and remains of the whole
      Nation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">�So
      when the time of the second (Jewish) mischief in the holy land comes, we
      will send against you our worshippers to inflict on you utter defeat and
      enter the Mosque (of Al-Aqsa) as they had entered it before and to
      devastate with utter destruction whatever they (the Jews) have built in
      their elevation.�</p>
