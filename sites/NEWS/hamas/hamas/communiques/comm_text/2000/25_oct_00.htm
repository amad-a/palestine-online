      on terrorist Barak's plan to segregate and isolate Palestinian areas,

      responsible source in the Hamas Movement said:</b><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-kashida: 0%; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">First:
      Terrorist Barak's plan to segregate and isolate Palestinian cities and
      villages comes as a chain in a series of repressive measures against our
      Palestinian people and an attempt to halt their roaring popular Intifadha.
      On the other hand the plan further targets pressuring the Palestinian and
      Arab parties that are still insisting on the settlement process to return
      to the negotiating table and accept the Zionist conditions and dictates.
      Despite the racial dimension of such a policy yet it is based on the de
      facto situation resulting from the Oslo A, B and C agreements, which
      endorsed retaining the settlements and constructing circular roads around
      them.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-kashida: 0%; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Today
      as terrorist Barak is continuing his declared war against our unarmed
      people using missiles, tanks, choppers and artillery to bombard our
      cities, camps and villages, our people assert with blood, martyrs and
      solid unity that there is no other road or option but Jihad, struggle and
      steadfastness to foil the enemy's measures and aggressive policies.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-kashida: 0%; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Second:
      The reports of Clinton's invitation to both Arafat and terrorist Barak
      for separate meetings come as a new attempt to abort the Aqsa Intifadha
      following the Paris and Sharm Al-Sheikh meetings. Such meetings only
      target luring the Palestinian Authority chairman into accepting American
      and Zionist dictates and conditions. The American administration, which
      compelled the PA to attend the Paris and Sharm Al-Sheikh meetings, is
      rudely biased in favor of the Zionist enemy. It attempts to justify and
      conceal the enemy's suppression and terrorism and equals between our
      people's unarmed children who use stones and the enemy's criminal army
      that is armed to the teeth with all kinds of weapons and that is shelling
      our cities and unarmed people with missiles.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-kashida: 0%; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We
      warn the PA chairman against going to that meeting, which is considered by
      our people as a new conspiracy aimed at aborting the Aqsa Intifadha. And
      we affirm that our people who offered more than 140 martyrs and five
      thousand wounded would never accept that price of that blood would be the
      return of the PA chairman to the negotiating table or an improvement in
      his negotiating conditions!!!</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-kashida: 0%; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We,
      along with our heroic people, wish to emphasize that Jihad, resistance;
      escalating the blessed Intifadha and the comprehensive popular
      confrontation against the Zionist enemy were the only means to defend the
      Aqsa and holy shrines, to grab our rights and to defeat occupation.</font><b><o:p>
