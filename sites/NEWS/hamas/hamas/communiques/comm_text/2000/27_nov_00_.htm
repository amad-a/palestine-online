      in which was sent down the Quran, as a guide to mankind, also Clear
      (Signs) for guidance and judgment (between right and wrong �� (Quran
      2/185)<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The advent of the month of
      Ramadan has bought with it blessings and tidings breezing anew the spirit
      of Jihad through remembering past historical memories of great victories
      of our forefathers in that blessed month during which they recorded heroic
      epics that changed history and that are still breathing spirit in our
      Nation hopefully inspiring it to restore lost honor and past glory.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Ramadan this year befalls
      us while the Nation is witnessing great events taking place on our holy
      land in which our people trigger anew the Jihad torch irrigating it with
      blood and remains of martyrs. The events have united our Nation along the
      road of Jihad and martyrdom to liberate its first Qibla and site of its
      prophet's Isra�.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our heroic Palestinian
      people � here you are initiating the month of Jihad and patience with
      more martyrs and sacrifices, patiently hoping for reward from Allah, here
      you are teaching the world with your pride and dignity that you are a
      people who will never die and will not kneel or surrender before their
      tormentors regardless of plots or treachery. You tell the world that your
      determination and readiness for death for the sake of Allah breath life
      into this Nation and restore hopes anew in Allah's promise and victory.<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our Palestinian people �
      a great month has begun so decorate it with your Jihad for the enemies of
      Allah, the damned Jews, are terrified of its advent. One of their
      criminals and senior leaders said, �The approach of the month of Ramadan
      so quickly (this year) is a very serious thing and necessitates exerting
      big efforts to prevent escalation of the intifada�. Another criminal
      said, �The Barak government should do all what it could to stop the
      intifada as soon as possible before the Palestinians seek closeness to
      Allah through their and our blood in Ramadan!� So disappoint them and
      persist in your blessed Jihad march and be sure that thus you would be
      glorified and honored besides receiving double reward from Allah. Hear our
      dear brothers, who love death as your enemies love life and who yearn for
      making even with grandsons of monkeys and pigs that desecrated our
      sanctities, shed our blood and usurped our holy land, hear the glad
      tidings of prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, �The stationing for one
      hour for the sake of Allah is better than praying Qiyam (late night
      prayers) of Lailatul Qadr at Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (the black stone in the
      holy Kaaba)�. Hear dear brothers, who are confronting enemies in Beitul
      Maqdes (Jerusalem) and its surroundings at this month where rewards are
      doubled, hear the glad tidings of prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him,
      �Lining for one hour in a battle for the sake of Allah is better than
      praying Qiyam (late night prayers) for sixty nights�. Hear dear
      brothers, who are guarding our Aqsa Mosque with bare chests and offering
      for its sake convoys of martyrs regardless of enemies� schemes and who
      guard the land of blessed Palestine, hear the glad tidings of prophet
      Mohammed, peace be upon him, 'shall I tell you about a night that is
      better than Lailatul Qadr? A sentry who stands on guard in a land of fear,
      (for) maybe he would not go back to his family.�<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our patient people in
      Palestine congratulations on the advent of the month of Ramadan, and let
      it be a distinctive month in escalating intifada activities and targeting
      criminal Jews in all areas of Palestine. And we, in the Islamic Resistance
      Movement, Hamas, would like to affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- Let next Friday be a
      day of rage and escalation of resistance against the occupiers � and a
      day of solidarity on the part of Arab and Islamic peoples through marches
      and activities.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- We Urge our people to
      spend more time on worship of Allah through praying at night, reciting
      holy Quran, organizing group breakfasting, lectures and seminars in
      mosques and seeking closeness to Allah through fighting Jews and
      inflicting severe casualties in their lines.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- We call on our people
      to head to the Aqsa Mosque, break the military siege around it and offer
      night prayers there especially on Fridays.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- We appeal to the rich
      people to pay their Zakat (alms), to cater for their brothers and to act
      as one body in face of the enemy's oppressive measures and savage siege.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5- We ask our people to
      pay special visits to families of martyrs and detainees and to call on the
      wounded.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our Arab-Islamic Nation
      � the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, seizes the occasion on the
      start of the holy month of Ramadan to congratulate the Arab and Islamic
      peoples and call on them to stick to the meanings of Jihad as crystallized
      in that great month. We urge them to shoulder their duty towards their
      stationed brothers on the land of Palestine and unite in their backing
      with money, arms, Duaa and political stands that reject halting the
      intifada or returning to negotiations with the enemy. We also ask them to
      endorse boycotting the Zionist entity and its supportive countries in
      words and deeds and to start preparing themselves for the coming day of
      confrontation with that entity. Let the month of Ramadan be the start of
      spreading public awareness among those peoples on the compulsory duty of
      Jihad for the sake of liberating Palestine. Let the television and space
      channels refrain from presenting disgraceful programs that weaken the
      Nation and distract youths from their fateful issues.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The month of Ramadan is
      one of generosity and the best of Sadakat (alms) is that given during that
      month, so let it be for the Mujahideen stationed on the land of Palestine
      and let worshippers in all mosques pray for the shackled Aqsa Mosque and
      for the Mujahideen seeking its liberation.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Finally, let all those who
      extend their hands to the criminal Jews and continue open and secret
      contacts with them for the sake of terminating our people's intifada,
      let them know that Allah will foil their work and that our people will
      never forgive them. Our people will remain an angry volcano ejecting lava
      over heads of the usurpers depending on the one and only Almighty Allah.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">�Allah has promised, to
      those among you who believe and work righteous deeds, that He will, of a
      surety, grant them in the land, inheritance (of power), as He granted it
      to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion,
      the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change (their
      state), after the fear in which they (lived), to one of security and
      peace: `They will worship Me (alone) and not associate aught with Me.' If
      any do reject Faith after this, they are rebellious and wicked.� (Quran
      24/55)<o:p>
