      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">In a flagrant challenge to feelings of our Palestinian people and
      feelings of our Arab and Islamic Nation, the Palestinian Authority at a
      late hour yesterday, Friday night 1/9/2000, staged a summary trial of the
      Mujahid Mahmoud Abu Hannoud the hero of the northern Osaira battle at the
      so-called state security court. The court sentenced Abu Hannoud to 12
      years behind bars! The �comic� trial took five minutes only!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The charges were: first forming armed cells and supplying them with arms
      and second establishing an alternative authority to that of the PA! The
      hero Abu Hannoud's response to those charges was: �I am a Mujahid for
      the cause of Allah and what I have done was a Jihad against occupying
      enemies and in defense of my country and people.�</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">Our people as well as our Nation have been surprised over the trial of
      the hero Abu Hannoud and with the oppressive verdict passed against him.
      The defense team that was composed of more than a hundred lawyer from
      within Palestine and others from Egypt and Jordan, who volunteered to
      defend the Mujahid hero was also surprised by the sentence. The team was
      not informed with date of the trial or the indictment list but rather the
      court hearing was arranged under the guise of darkness. To cap the comedy,
      a police lieutenant who does not have a license to practice law was
      assigned to defend Abu Hannoud.<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

      of trying Mujahid Abu Hannoud would like to affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We condemn this trial or any other trial against this hero and his likes
          of the Mujahideen. And we condemn the policy of arresting them for the
          heroic Mujahideen should be honored and their heroism glorified and
          not imprisoned and tried.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This trial against Mujahid Abu Hannoud is a national crime that made
          light of our people's feelings and convictions. It further shocked
          the feelings of our Arab and Islamic masses.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This trial is merely a humiliating submission to demands and conditions
          of the occupation, which impose on the PA and its security apparatuses
          protection of occupation and security coordination with the Zionist
          Mossad and Shabak along with the CIA and persecuting and arresting
          Mujahideen. This summary trial posed as an immolation offered by the
          PA on the eve of its upcoming meeting with CIA chief George Tenet and
          US president Clinton.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">This phony trial and its oppressive verdict affirm our people's
          conviction that the PA had no justice and affirm absence of integrity
          and independence at its court and judiciary. This reminds our people
          of the years of scores of make believe courts and tyrannical verdicts
          conducted by that Authority over the past few years.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">The trial and the harsh verdicts should be rather passed against the
          leaders of the Zionist enemy and their herds of soldiers who wreaked
          havoc in the village of northern Osaira at night. They forced its
          inhabitants out of their homes at gunpoint, demolished one of the
          houses and destroyed many apartments, where was the PA's leaders and
          judges towards that enemy's crime?</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:
embed">We call on the PA in the name of our people within and outside Palestine
          and on behalf of the Arab and Islamic masses to cancel that trial and
          its verdict. We call for the immediate release of Mujahid Abu Hannoud,
          the termination of such trials and the annulment of their verdicts
          against him and his colleagues the Mujahideen and other notable
          figures of our people. Our cause today especially in the light of
          threats against Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the Aqsa was in dire need of
          their Jihad and efforts, which necessitate the immediate release of
          Mujahid Mohammed Daif and other Mujahideen along with other notable
          figures such as Dr. Ranteesi, Dr. Makadme, Sheikh Jamal Natshe and
          Sheikh Jamal Mansour.</li>

          <p class="MsoNormal" dir="LTR" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:

          expressed solidarity with Mujahid Abu Hannoud and flocked into the
          village of northern Osaira to support its inhabitants. We also highly
          appreciate the efforts of the lawyers in the defense team who
          volunteered to defend the Mujahid Abu Hannoud.</li>

          and students to express denunciation of the PA's crime of arresting
          and trying the Mujahid Abu Hannoud. We ask them to express their anger
          and dismay by all possible means so as to put an end to the
          Authority's contempt and challenge of our people's feelings and
          compel it release him and all his brothers the Mujahideen.<b><i><o:p>
