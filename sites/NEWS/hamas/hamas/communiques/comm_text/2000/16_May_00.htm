      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Our
      detainees in occupation jails are engaged in the battle of empty stomachs
      against the occupation authority, our people are revolting in various
      cities, villages and refugee camps in solidarity with our heroic detainees
      and engaging the enemy troops in bloody confrontations, the Zionist
      enemy�s government is degrading the Palestinian Authority imposing on it
      humiliating concessions over Al-Quds (Jerusalem), right of return and
      settlements in the so-called final status talks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">At
      such a critical stage, the PA committed a sinful crime by arresting the
      Mujahid hero Mohammed Daif as a sacrifice for the Zionist enemy�s
      government and as a price for the latter�s approval to surrender part of
      the blessed land of Palestine in Abu Dees and Alezariye to the PA. The
      arrest also came to pave the way for the government of the enemy to
      announce its approval of the establishment of an illusionary (Palestinian)
      state that is based on scattered areas of land, with no army or
      sovereignty on land, air or wealth. The PA is thus performing its role,
      drawn by the occupation, to strike the resistance, humiliate our people,
      accept the occupation as a de facto situation and submit to its conditions
      and dictates.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">This
      crime is yet another chain in a series of similar crimes against heroic
      Mujahideen of our people especially the Qassam Brigades, some of which
      included sharing in assassinating the two heroes Eng. Yehya Ayyash and
      Kamal Keheil and assassinating their brothers heroes Eng. Mohaiuddin
      Sharif, Adel and Emad Awadallah in addition to scores others of our
      people�s heroes and Mujahideen.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">The
      timing and the attempt to cover up for the crime in addition to attempting
      to deny it in the media aim at deceiving our people and avoiding their
      expected angry reaction against that Authority, a matter that would expose
      its symbols and security officials.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">We,
      in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, condemn that hideous crime,
      which reveals treachery, cowardice and villainy. We warn that Authority of
      insisting on its crime or of any harm done to our brother the hero or
      handing him over to the occupation authority and we demand his immediate
      release along with all other detainees in its jails.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Let
      the Authority know that by insisting on that crime, it would be fighting
      its own people and their right of defending their lands and resisting the
      Zionist occupiers. It would be also turning its back on the Jihad and
      sacrifices of our people, Ummah, Islam and Arabism.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed">Let
      the Authority, along with the occupation; know that our Jihad and
      resistance against occupation will continue until liberation regardless of
      obstacles, campaigns or treachery. We are confident that victory is for
      the believers the Mujahideen and that shame is the fate of all quislings.
      We are confident that Allah supports us and also our people and all those
      oppressors will one day realize what a deep pit they had fallen in. And
      Allah�s ordained words will no doubt be prevalent, But most people do
      not know.</p>
