      its crimes and terrorism against our unarmed people using warplanes, tanks
      and missiles. It unleashed its heavily armed settler gangsters who spread
      destruction, terrorism and bloodletting in a bid to subdue our people,
      judaize Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and demolish the Aqsa to build the alleged
      temple in its place. This wanton enemy believed that the language of
      terrorism and blind force could force our people into submission in
      accordance with Zionist conditions and speculations. Here is the enemy
      with its military hardware encircling our unarmed people and here they are
      our people, as they have always done, resisting the enemy and its missiles
      with bare chests, heads high, not terrorized by tanks or missiles. Martyrs
      fall one after the other in defense of al-Quds, the Aqsa, holy shrines and

      West Bank and the Gaza Strip to hit the streets to defy the Zionist
      shelling and form a human shield to protect their installations and
      national institutions. We affirm that our heroic people will defend
      themselves, their sanctities and dignity until the last Palestinian child
      God willing and will never bow for other than Allah but rather will
      withstand and fight and will not be scared by missiles or tanks or all the

      Zionist enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let this enemy
      understand that our people are not alone in this world but rather backed
      by their Arab and Islamic Nation that will not let them down and will not
      let them face death and terrorism alone. This is the time of real work for
      the sake of defending the Nation's higher interests and this is the time
      for the Arab and Islamic armies that must move to rescue the Aqsa, Al-Quds
      and our unarmed people.<o:p>

      Islamic masses that strongly backed our people in the past few days and
      expressed their anger over Zionist massacres to continue their solidarity
      with our people and to continue supporting the Aqsa and take to the
      streets tomorrow Friday and the other days in angry marches and roaring
      protests to condemn the Zionist aggression and to reflect unity of our
      Nation and its insistence on its rights and sanctities and to demand from
      leaders of that Nation to declare Jihad in defense of the Aqsa and to
      rescue the unarmed Palestinian people.<o:p>

      which established relations with the Zionist enemy, to expel the enemy's
      ambassadors and representatives and to close down its embassies and
      representation offices at once in retaliation to the Zionist aggression,
      which is the least they should do at this particular stage. On this
      occasion we hail our brothers in Oman Sultanate for their nationalist
      decision of closing down the Zionist representation office to protest the
      Zionist aggression against our unarmed people, which came in harmony with
      the Nation's conscience.<o:p>

      dead peace process and we ask the PA to declare officially the end of that
      peace process and to announce that the only option to confront the
      arrogant enemy is Jihad and resistance and that whatever was taken by
      force would be only restored by force.<o:p>
