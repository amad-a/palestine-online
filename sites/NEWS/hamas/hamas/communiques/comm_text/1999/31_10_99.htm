      Movement (Hamas) has observed with extreme disapproval and annoyance the
      decision made by the Mauritanian government to promote to ambassadorial
      level its diplomatic representation with the Zionist Regime. Mauritania
      opened a guardianship office in the Zionist State in 1995, an issue that
      was faced with a wide range of anger and rejection among the Arab and
      Muslim worlds.<o:p>

      Mauritania is being taken at a time when the Zionist leaders are
      escalating their arbitrary measures and suppression of our People, their
      continued occupation of the Palestinian and Arab territories, their denial
      of the legitimate rights of our People, their expansion of settlement
      activities, their insisting that Jerusalem is their eternal capital, as
      well as their rejection of the return of the refugees and their hunting
      down of our Mujahideen. This step is equivalent to a stab in the backs of
      our Palestinian People in particular and the Arab and Muslim nations in
      general. It is also considered a new blow to Arab Unity, which the United
      States and the Zionist Enemy have been combining their efforts to
      fragmentize in order to pave the road for the Zionists to dominate the
      whole Arab region. <o:p>

      submission by the Mauritanian authorities to American and Zionist false
      promises of introducing economic assistance and prosperity to Mauritania.
      It seems that the Mauritanian authorities have not learned from what
      happened to other Arab States that signed peace treaties with the usurping
      Zionist entity and that also falsely believed that these treaties would
      bring assistance, luxury and prosperity to their countries. On the
      contrary, they destroyed their economies and increased poverty,
      unemployment and frustration.<o:p>

      took advantage of Mauritania's poverty and its need to build relations
      with Tel Aviv since 1995 by reaching an agreement with Mauritania to make
      its desert a dump for Israeli nuclear wastes, which raised fears and
      concerns by the Mauritanian People and the Magharebi States because of
      their consequent threats against the people and states of the region.<o:p>
