      <h3 align="center"><font color="#800000">On PA�s �conditional!�
      approval of the American proposals<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%">In a very
      serious development, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority headed to
      Washington for talks with American president Clinton in response to the
      latter�s request and pressures to discuss his recent settlement
      proposals. It was later announced that the Authority chief had given his
      conditional approval of those proposals. The White House spokesman further
      declared that the Authority chief had agreed to work for ending what they
      call violence (i.e. the intifada) and resuming security coordination with
      the Zionist enemy. For their part, some PA officials said that the
      Authority�s stance vis-&agrave;-vis the American paper would be declared
      during meetings of the Arab follow-up committee that is to be held later
      today in Cairo.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the light of such a critical situation, we in
      the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>First:</b>
      Clinton�s proposals were in fact Zionist proposals, conditions and
      speculations that were adopted by Clinton as is and tabled them as
      American proposals. They do not meet any of our Palestinian people�s
      rights or those of the Arab and Islamic Nation while meeting all enemy
      demands and ambitions.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Second:</b>
      Those proposals cancel the right of return for more than five million
      Palestinian refugees who are living in the diaspora and who are sticking
      to their right of return to their homeland, lands, houses and property for
      more than fifty years. Accepting the American proposals would be a stab in
      the back of our people�s refugees.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Third:</b>
      Clinton�s proposals endorse Jewish and Zionist sovereignty on the Haram
      Al-Sharif and on parts of it. They give the Jews sovereignty over the area
      underneath the Haram, which allow continued digging in a way threatening
      the very existence of the Aqsa. They also give the Jews sovereignty over
      the Buraq Wall, which Clinton and the Zionist enemy call the (Wailing
      Wall) while in fact it is part and parcel of the holy Aqsa Mosque. The
      phrase in Clinton�s proposals even speaks of controlling the whole
      western wall, which extends for around half a kilometer inside the Islamic
      quarters. A dangerous tunnel was opened underneath that wall in 1996 thus
      boosting the enemy�s control on the whole area. The proposals
      furthermore retain the city of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) under Zionist
      sovereignty.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Fourth:</b>
      Clinton�s proposals also meet the Zionists� conditions leaving most of
      the Zionist settlements in the West Bank and Al-Quds as a dagger in the
      heart of our lands after turning those lands into isolated and severed
      isles and keeping our people under the mercy of the armed-to-the-teeth
      herds of settlers.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Fifth:</b>
      The promised Palestinian state, according to Clinton�s proposals, is
      nothing but a disfigured autonomous enclave. The enemy�s army will
      continue to control borders and crossings through its presence as the
      basis of international forces that would be deployed along the so-called
      (Green line) and along the eastern borders with Jordan. The enemy would
      also retain early warning stations and arms caches in various areas in the
      West Bank and would be allowed free access into the airspace as part of
      its army�s exercises.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Sixth:</b>
      The bases of American (Clinton�s) proposals are null and void and
      contradict our people�s interests and legitimate rights. Hence there is
      no meaning for the so-called demands for clarifications regarding those
      proposals. Consequently the PA�s announcement that it will adopt its
      final decision after meetings of the Arab follow-up ministerial committee
      is a rejected maneuver. It is only understood as an attempt to win an Arab
      support under American pressures. A return to negotiations in Washington
      on the basis of the American proposals is a new absurd step that is
      rejected by our people.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Faced
      by those facts, we in the Hamas Movement call for the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>First:</b>
      We urge the Arab follow-up committee and all Arab and Islamic countries to
      declare a clear-cut and frank position rejecting the American proposals in
      toto. We remind them that our people within and outside the homeland
      refuse such proposals and stick to their full rights and insist on
      liberating their lands and expelling the occupiers. Our people are
      capable, by the grace of Allah, of achieving that through their blessed
      intifada, escalating resistance and national unity. This dictates on the
      Arab countries to adopt our people�s stand and back their blessed
      intifada and anti-occupation program in its capacity as the real and
      practical option. We affirm that our people are not facing a dilemma but
      rather the Zionist enemy and the American administration are the ones who
      are facing a dilemma and we as Palestinians and as an Arab and Islamic
      Nation are not concerned with saving them.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Second:</b>
      We demand the PA to clearly decide rejecting the American proposals and to
      end any dealing with them or negotiating over them. It is high time to
      stop hesitation and maneuvering. The PA should declare such a position
      during the Arab follow-up committee meetings. It should give more
      consideration to our Palestinian people and their clear stand in insisting
      on their rights and demands. The PA should not give any consideration to
      American pressures nor to Clinton�s personal interests or Barak�s
      election interests.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Third:</b>
      We warn against the return of security coordination between the Authority
      and the Zionist enemy under supervision of American intelligence and the
      ensuing persecution of our people�s Mujahideen and heroes of their
      intifada or their liquidation. We also warn of any measures that the PA
      might resort to in a bid to end the intifada and prosecute its heroes in
      response to American and Zionist demands.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Fourth:</b>
      The Hamas Movement along with all our people�s forces rejects such a
      serious deterioration in the Palestinian stand and submission to
      American-Zionist hegemony. We call on our people to stick to their blessed
      intifada, resistance and steadfastness in confrontation of the enemy and
      the Zionist aggression on our people and sanctities.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b>Fifth:</b>
      <u>We affirm the decisive fact that no Palestinian, Arab or Muslim leader
      has the right of approving any agreements or treaties that reduce our
      people�s rights in Al-Quds, the Aqsa, the whole land of Palestine,
      return of refugees, dismantling settlements, liberating our lands and
      establishing a real sovereign state. Any such agreements would not
      represent our people or their free will and they would not be binding on
      us or our people who will tear apart any humiliating agreement through
      blood of their martyrs and struggle and Jihad of their sons.<o:p>
