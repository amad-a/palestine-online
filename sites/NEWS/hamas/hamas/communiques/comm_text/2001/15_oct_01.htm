      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our Mujahid people, who
      have chosen the road of intifada and resistance and shunned other roads,
      � the Zionist enemy is proceeding in its criminal schemes against our
      people without heeding anyone or paying attention to the so falsely called
      ceasefire. The enemy is besieging and storming cities and suburbs and
      assassinating our heroes in cold blood. It is exercising terrorism without
      anyone denouncing its deeds. The enemy is exploiting the international
      circumstances and the world's preoccupation with the American-led war
      against Muslims in Afghanistan to carry out its terrorist crimes against
      this persevering people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yesterday the Zionist
      terrorist forces assassinated the Mujahid hero Abdul Rahman Hammad in
      Qalqilya district and today they assassinated another hero of our people
      and one of the cadres of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, the
      Mujahid hero Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Marshood. The Mujahid had spent seven
      years in occupation jails for resisting Zionist occupation and for being a
      member in the Qassam Brigades. He was released by the end of 1999 only to
      continue to follow up concerns of the Palestinian detainees. He had lived
      with them and served them within the prison then served them outside it
      through his work in the ministry of prisoners� affairs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The cowardly assassination
      operation was carried out while Marshood was heading to his work at the
      office of the prisoners� affairs ministry in the city of Nablus where a
      booby-trapped car, parking in front of the office, exploded when he was
      passing near it, which affirms that the operation was engineered by
      occupation and its agents.<u><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist enemy's
      continuous policy of terrorism against our people should not be met on the
      part our Palestinian people with raising the white flag, surrendering to
      the de facto situation and abiding by the ceasefire, which made the
      Zionist enemy go to extremes in its terrorist crimes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our Palestinian people
      will not let the blood of their martyrs go in vain, neither will they
      waste sacrifices or accomplishments of the intifada and resistance. Our
      people have the right to defend themselves and to resist the usurping
      occupiers with all available strength.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is high time for our
      people and lions of resistance, brigades and factions of our people, to go
      on the offensive and to retaliate to the crimes of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
