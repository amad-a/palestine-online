      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Islamic

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="font-size:11.5pt">On
      the first annual anniversary of the Aqsa intifada<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">When
      the intifada broke out this same day last year in defense of the holy Aqsa
      Mosque against the provocative visit of terrorist Sharon, the most
      optimistic observers estimated that it would continue for a few days or
      weeks. However, a whole year has elapsed and our people�s intifada is
      still persisting with the grace of Allah then with the steadfastness and
      determination of our struggling people that sacrificed all for the sake of
      their country. This is the spirit with which the executors of martyrdom
      operations carried while penetrating the enemy�s fortifications to
      spread panic in the hearts of the Zionist occupiers of our country day and
      night in each and every part of our holy land.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Our
      people have disappointed the capitulatory elements that kept on
      championing realism slogans, declaring that our people�s struggle was
      over and that we had nothing else left to accept except what the Zionists
      offer at the begging tables which they falsely call �negotiations�! In
      return our people did not disappoint their Nation�s aspirations but
      rather during that year, our people continued to surprise the Nation with
      acts greater than its expectations and healed the breasts of believers who
      look forward to victory over the aggressors and to ejecting them from our
      holy land.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Our
      people have displayed and still are displaying a legendary and astonishing
      steadfastness and unprecedented determination to regain their right to
      their national soil and rejection of undermining that right under any
      pretext despite the unprecedented Zionist continuous terrorist campaign
      during the reign of both terrorists Barak and Sharon. Those terrorist
      campaigns employed all means to enforce surrender on our people and
      factions including live bullets, internationally-banned explosive bullets,
      depleted uranium, artillery and tank shells and American-made planes such
      the Apaches and the F-16s and others. Consequently all conspiracies to
      abort the intifada were foiled due to that people�s solid determination
      and their dependence on Allah first and foremost then on backing of the
      Arab and Islamic Nation.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Our
      Mujahid Palestinian people:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>On
      this great occasion, your Movement, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
      affirms the following lessons from the first year of the intifada:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">First:
      The intifada achieved big gains for the Palestine cause and led to
      important changes in the Arab-Zionist conflict represented by endorsing
      the resistance program as a strategic option for the Palestinian people
      and the Arab and Islamic Nation. Such a consequence necessitated
      perpetuating and developing the intifada in addition to resisting any
      attempt to halt or abort it before it reaches its aspired goal of
      cleansing occupation off our lands.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Second:
      The intifada crystallized and boosted Palestinian national unity and
      pushed forward horizons of joint Palestinian national endeavor along the
      way to drafting a Palestinian national program based on intifada and
      resistance. It was proven in practice that intifada and resistance united
      our people and that the settlement process and negotiations divided them.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Third:
      The intifada raised the popular interaction at with the uprising as the
      Nation expressed its huge support to the Palestinian people. The masses
      were able of compelling the official Arab leaderships to hold an emergency
      and ordinary summits. Yet, the official Arab stand, which is suffering
      from American pressures and internal difference, did not succeed so far in
      living up to the Nation�s popular aspirations and demands represented in
      breaking relations with the Zionists, ending all forms of normalization
      and opening the borders for the Mujahideen to join their brothers in
      Palestine.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Fourth:
      The intifada succeeded in neutralizing the balance of force with the
      enemy, which was on its side, when compared to the Palestinians and to
      each Arab country separately. The martyrdom operations and other heroic
      attacks succeeded in achieving the �balance� with the Zionists who
      could not withstand great casualties while our people showed growing
      patience and sacrifice actualizing Allah�s words: <b><i>�If ye are
      suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have
      hope from Allah, while they have none.�</i></b> This is the first and
      basic step that enhances the possibility of the intifada and
      resistance�s success in flushing occupation out of our lands without
      peace agreements or concessions.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Fifth:
      The intifada unveiled the real fanatic image of the Zionist society, which
      elected a man like Sharon to rule with a big percentage of votes in his
      favor and which still is expressing support to the terrorist government
      that is formed out of various forces of that society. Hence, the intifada
      exposed the false peace calls and erased the so-called barrier between the
      Zionist �left� and �right� or the �doves� and the �hawks�.
      The Zionist society brazenly exposed its image as a society of hawks that
      only believed in violence to achieve its goals.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Sixth:
      The absolute American bias in favor of the Zionists and Europe�s
      inability to exercise any effective role in the region showed that we must
      depend on the Nation�s options of Jihad and resistance rather than
      American or other mediations.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <h1><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Our Mujahid Palestinian people � our
      great Nation�s masses<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The
      first anniversary of the blessed intifada fell at a time when
      repercussions of the explosions in the USA were still live where attempts
      to form an international alliance to combat �terrorism� were still
      ongoing. The American administration wants to make of our people�s
      intifada an oblation for the success of this alliance. At the same time,
      the Sharon government is exploiting the world�s preoccupation with what
      happened in America to launch more terrorist attacks against our people.
      More than twenty Palestinian martyrs fell over the few days that followed
      the New York and Washington explosions without any international
      condemnation voiced coping with the magnitude of occupation forces�
      massacres!<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">And
      again the Zionist aggression escalated yesterday against our people in
      Rafah when occupation forces killed seven martyrs and wounded scores
      others in less than 24 hours.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We,
      in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) congratulate our people over
      continuation of their Jihad and intifada and salute all those who resist
      the enemy and its terrorism especially the Mujahideen who are deployed in
      all areas of our holy land, guarding the country, chasing the Zionist
      usurpers and defending the Nation�s honor and dignity. We pray that
      Allah would accept all our victims as martyrs, to reward them the best and
      to aid us in catering for their families and the families of the wounded
      and the steadfast detainees. We affirm that our people did not and would
      not forget their sacrifices and would continue to exert utmost efforts to
      ensure their release from Zionist jails.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We
      would like here to affirm the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">1-All
      forces of our people, backed by our Arab and Islamic Nation, are
      determined on persisting with and escalating the intifada until
      eradication of occupation from all of our usurped lands. This was evident
      in our people�s marches and rallies that rejected ceasefire agreements
      and denounced security coordination with the enemy.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">2-We
      urge the Palestinian Authority to break away from the so called peace
      process once and for all, adopt the resistance program, refuse all forms
      of coordination and negotiations and security meetings with the enemy, not
      to be deceived by American promises or bow to its pressures and reject any
      ceasefire calls since the intifada and resistance are our people�s
      legitimate rights.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">3-We
      call on the Arab and Islamic countries to shoulder their duty in backing
      the Palestinian people�s steadfastness and Jihad and to stick to their
      excellent stand in rejecting attempts to label Palestinian resistance as
      terrorism. Our people�s resistance should never be put alongside
      terrorism in one basket and we as Muslims, Arabs and Palestinians should
      not pay the price of the New York and Washington explosions.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">4-We
      ask our people in the diaspora to display more interaction with our
      people�s intifada in the occupied homeland and share with them in the
      duty of resisting occupation.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Finally,
      we pray that the second year of the intifada would be full of blessing and
      that Almighty Allah would expedite victory and liberation for our people.
      We are confident that our people�s resistance would continue as long as
      occupation continued and that all the enemies and defeatists� cunning
      schemes to halt the intifada and return our cause backwards to the mirage
      of humiliating settlements would end up in utter failure Insha�allah.<o:p>
      </o:p>
