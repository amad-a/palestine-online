      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><i>�If

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Yesterday the enemy
      committed a new massacre killing eight of our people including two of the
      political leaders, the martyrs Jamal Mansour and Jamal Salim.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A few days ago other
      massacres were committed in Fara refugee camp, Khalil, Bethlehem and Gaza
      strip in which scores of civilians were killed in addition to members of
      our people�s resistance organizations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Then there was the serious
      step of storming and desecrating the holy Aqsa Mosque by enemy soldiers
      and policemen and the attempt to lay down the foundation stone of their
      alleged temple on the ruins of the Aqsa!!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our patient, Mujahid
      Palestinian people:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our honest Arab and
      Islamic masses:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">This means that Sharon is committing continuous
      attritional massacres and an all-out war of annihilation � this means a
      serious qualitative change in the aggression that necessitates an
      important and inevitable leap in the struggle on the part of the
      Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic peoples.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our steadfast people on
      the land of Palestine:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>The inevitable
      Palestinian change should entail:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1-an open confrontation in
      each and every part in Palestine using all means.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2-mobilizing all
      Palestinian combat potentials: the factions, police and all those owning
      weapons in the Palestinian Authority and among our people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is not religiously or
      nationally acceptable that guns of tens of thousands within the PA remain
      curbed in face of such Zionist massacres! All Palestinians are targeted,
      so let all of them participate in the combat and the defense.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3-there should be a
      serious plan in which all should cooperate to terminate once and for all
      the dangers of agents who serve as the enemy�s eyes and dirty tools.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4-there should be no other
      alternative to resistance and intifada. All those advocating more contacts
      with the enemy, a ceasefire and dealing with American and Western attempts
      to calm down and end the intifada should shut up! All must unite over the
      resistance program.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our Arab and Islamic
      masses everywhere:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is a shame on Arabs and
      Muslims to stand idle by vis-&agrave;-vis the daily and continuous
      extermination of an Arab, Islamic people on the land of Isra� wal
      Mi�rage!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There is no excuse today
      for the Nation for not shouldering its duty towards Palestine and its
      people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Consequently, it is high
      time for an Arab and Islamic change to take place quickly and seriously.
      This necessitates among other things:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1-Jihad against the
      Zionist Jews in this stage is a compulsory duty on all not only the
      Palestinian people, but rather on each and every Arab and Muslim concerned
      with the Aqsa, the first Muslim Qibla, and concerned with Al-Quds and
      Palestine, and concerned with his Palestinian brother who is slaughtered
      daily and who is fighting alone with modest weapons against an army
      equipped with a huge military arsenal and supported by all world Jews.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">It is no longer acceptable to say that Arabs and
      Muslims are not capable of launching Jihad! Rather each and every Arab and
      Muslim is capable of launching Jihad against the Zionist Jews when he is
      true with himself and really intends to perform this duty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Don�t the Jews fight
      your brothers and target you all whether in the east or west?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What will Sharon and the
      Zionist entity�s criminals do if they finish off your brothers in
      Palestine, God forbid?! And will regret be of any use then?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Each and every Arab and
      Muslim believing in these facts that lie before his very eyes should be
      content with Allah�s permission to defend himself, his brothers and
      sanctities: <b><i>�To those against whom war is made, permission is
      given (to fight), because they are wronged; and verily, Allah is Most
      Powerful for their aid.�<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </i></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2-The Islamic and national
      movements and factions in our Nation should bear their responsibility in
      this open and ferocious battle. Otherwise what will they utter before
      Almighty Allah? What will they tell history and future posterity? What
      will they say to the convoys of martyrs: the children, women, the old and
      men?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Why is the Palestinian,
      Arab, Muslim always the target of murder at the hands of Zionist
      occupiers? why don�t the Zionist Jews be targets as well?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Do not wait for that from
      the Palestinian people alone, for despite their presence in a big prison
      and tightening siege around their cities, villages and camps, they fight
      with all what they can and sacrifice their dearest men, heroes and
      leaders. It is about time to perform your role and Almighty Allah will ask
      you about that; and history does not have mercy on anyone. Your life is
      meaningless without sharing your brothers in Palestine in the duty of
      Jihad.</p>
