      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i></p>
      <p class="MsoSubtitle" align="center"><b>Zionist criminals demolish houses
      on its inhabitants</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our Mujahid Palestinian
      people �<o:p>
      </o:p>

      Nation �<o:p>

      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist enemy is
      launching a ferocious war using its terrorist war machine against our
      people. In one of its beastly and dirty offensives, the enemy forces
      launched a barbaric assault against our steadfast people in Khan Younis
      refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. They razed around 30 houses to the ground
      with all their furniture and other contents. They frightened children and
      women and attacked the camp like wild beasts: shelling, demolishing and
      destroying whatever was in their way.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This cowardly war
      unleashed by terrorist Sharon and his terrorist gang against our people,
      in which he dares to storm areas previously evacuated, points to the
      enemy's murderous and destructive plans carried out by land, sea and
      air.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our Palestinian people,
      who are resisting, challenging and defending in absolute bravery and who
      stand united in face of continuous treachery, asks our Arab and Islamic
      Nation: why this silence and humiliation? Why fly to Washington to seek
      solutions while our Palestinian people are continuing to sacrifice blood
      and soul for the sake of Allah and in defense of the Nation's dignity
      and sanctities that are occupied by the Zionists with complete American
      support.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We warn the Nation against
      repercussions of this war, which is escalating against our unarmed people,
      especially when that enemy was still mobilizing its forces at the
      outskirts of the Khan Younis refugee camp and along all borders with
      Palestine occupied in 1948 in a bid to repeat its storming operations and
      inflict more killing and destruction and to further frighten children,
      elderly and women.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Let the Nation stand
      united and let its marches and protests against the usurping occupation
      hit the streets of all Arab and Muslim lands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We affirm that our Mujahid
      people will not be intimidated by this terrorism and that their march will
      not be halted by those aggressions depending, in this regard, on Allah
      first then on our glorified people and Nation.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The martyrs in the Khan Younis battle the martyr
      hero Elias Abu Issa and the martyr hero Hani Abu Rezk along with scores of
      wounded persons are enough proof of that enemy's savagery. They also
      affirm that our people will persist along the Jihad and resistance march
      and will never surrender or bow down except to almighty Allah.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>And it is a Jihad until either victory or martyrdom</i></p>
