      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, views with
      absolute seriousness chairman Arafat�s address to the Palestinian people
      on the occasion of Eidul Fitr due to the following reasons:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Demanding the Palestinian
      people and their resistance factions to halt resistance and Jihad even if
      the Zionist enemy continued its assassinations and massacres of the
      Palestinians. Such a demand opens the door wide open for mass murderer
      Sharon to continue his annihilation campaign of the Palestinian people
      with Palestinian protection.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Allowing occupation to
      continue in its aggression against our Palestinian people while preventing
      the Palestinians from defending themselves is an unacceptable oppressive
      equation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Considering the heroic
      martyrdom operations that achieved a kind of balance of deterrence and
      represented the only Palestinian weapon to attain national rights as
      terrorist operations gained Sharon legitimacy that he was in dire need to
      launch a rabid war against our Mujahid Palestinian people. It further
      dealt a blow to our Palestinian people�s struggle over the past decade
      and constituted a new dangerous retreat in face of Zionist blackmail of
      the Palestinian Authority.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Depriving the Palestinian
      people from their right of self-defense and describing it as terrorism,
      which should have rather been used to describe occupation, was in
      violation of all laws and norms that allowed peoples the right of
      self-defense.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Outlawing Palestinian
      resistance after considering it as an act of terrorism granted legality to
      occupation because it stripped Palestinian resistance of legitimacy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Insisting on prosecution
      of Mujahid Palestinian factions threatens unity of the Palestinian lines
      and achieves the Zionists� repeated and declared target of igniting a
      civil war in the Palestinian street.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Closing charitable
      institutions that effectively contributed in bolstering our Palestinian
      people�s steadfastness in face of the Zionist gang�s policies of siege
      and starvation in a bid to liquidate the Palestine cause and existence
      would no doubt share in subduing the Palestinian people and accepting the
      Zionist humiliating dictates.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">-Pending hopes on false
      American promises and adopting destined stands based on such promises
      posed as a serious threat to the fate of our Palestine cause.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Islamic Resistance
      Movement outlines such warnings before the Palestinian people and appeals
      to all Palestinian national and Islamic forces to declare their stands in
      absolute integrity for now there is no room for courtesy or partisan
      rivalry at the expense of our Palestinian people�s legitimate rights,
      just cause and rightful struggle. We also beseech all forces to stand
      united in the resistance trench before the disaster befalls all at which
      regret would be of no use. We also urge the Arab and Islamic Ummah to
      extend support to our legitimate struggle, to back our people�s
      steadfastness in their crucial battle and to break away from American
      hegemony by refusing all projects aimed at liquidating our Palestine
      cause.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We are confident that
      victory will be on our side in the end but we must continue with our Jihad
      and legitimate resistance and Allah will be along our side and will never
      make our work go in vain.</p>
