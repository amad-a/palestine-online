      Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) to extend our deepest greetings and
      appreciation and our best wishes for success of your conference in service
      of the Nation's questions praying that Allah would guide you to what is
      best for the countries and peoples.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Your Majesties
      and Excellencies</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Your meeting is held
      amidst critical circumstances and a historic turning point in life of our
      Arab Nation and Palestinian people, who are still exercising their
      legitimate right of self defense and struggle against Zionist occupation,
      equipped with belief, determination and insistence on attaining freedom
      and liberation offering along the way grave sacrifices and a long queue of
      martyrs, wounded and detainees.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Faced by such
      unprecedented steadfastness, the Zionist occupation escalated its
      aggressive and terrorist practices against our Mujahid people: killing
      children, women and innocent, assassinating Mujahideen and active cadres,
      imposing oppressive siege and cutting the West Bank and Gaza Strip into
      scores of isolated isles that turned the Palestinian citizens� life into
      utter misery. The occupation adopted siege and starvation as a policy
      aimed at ending the intifada and subduing the Palestinian people,
      terminating their will of steadfastness and resistance and increasing
      their sufferings � turning their life into hell. Our people while living
      through a state of revolt and struggle with all its repercussions and
      sacrifices look forward to your esteemed summit for a supportive Arab
      stand that would back their struggle and steadfastness and ease their
      pains and help them achieve their goals in freedom, liberation and
      independence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Your Majesties
      and Excellencies</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This critical and
      important stage in our Nation's history and conflict with the Zionist
      enemy calls on us to remind you with the following facts:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Zionist enemy is a
      usurping entity ever since Ben Gurion till the terrorist Sharon that only
      believes in the Zionist ideology based on murder, aggression and
      expansion. They do not accept peace unless with their own conditions and
      dictates that serve a certain stage of their expansionist plans.
      Consequently the American administration's so-called peace only led to
      endorsing occupation, settlement and judaization of Palestinian lands. All
      efforts to convince various enemy leaders to meet the minimum demands of
      the Palestinian Authority had failed especially when the negotiations
      reached discussions on the final status solution.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Palestinian people's
      insistence on their lands and holy places and on resisting occupation with
      all available means, including all out popular intifada and armed
      operations, was the thing that shook the Zionist ideology and caused a
      real crisis for the enemy. It was the obvious reason for the fall of enemy
      leaders one after the other and the most important thing is that it led
      the Zionist society to question destiny and future of the Zionist entity.
      With absolute understanding of the Palestinian and Lebanese situations and
      their differences in Zionist thinking, yet the Lebanese lesson remains big
      and meaningful. The resistance, backed by political resoluteness and
      popular steadfastness, forced the Zionist enemy to withdraw in humiliation
      from South Lebanon after more than 20 years of occupation without
      negotiations or political agreement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A close follow up of the
      Zionist entity and the internal political conflicts and debates, loss of
      security and stability even after 50 years of its creation, inability to
      end our Palestinian people's intifada and resistance despite the great
      disparity in the balance of power, would reveal the brittle status of that
      entity and the fact that it has no future in the region. The Zionist
      entity has even started the stage of retreat and collapse, God willing,
      after the peak that it had reached. No American-supplied material strength
      would help it continue its supremacy over all Arab countries or even a
      single Arab country. Sharon's ascension to power on the basis of
      providing security after failure of Barak's program, which was based on
      peace and security, proves that the entity was in a state of confusion.
      Sharon and his terrorist government members� threats should not scare
      anyone because they reflect a state of fear and confusion more than a
      state of confidence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The American
      administration, regardless of who is sitting at the White House, has
      always been biased in favor of the Zionist enemy and committed to its
      military supremacy over the Arab countries despite the quantity and
      quality of American interests in the Arab region. The new administration
      of George Bush had inaugurated its era with bombing Iraq and declaring
      intention to move its embassy to Al-Quds, giving a down-level priority to
      the Arab-Zionist conflict. Above all, this administration is asking for a
      chance to Sharon; thus it is of no use to bet neither on the American
      stance that is totally biased nor on the hopeless European position.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The new government of
      Sharon, which reflects the general Zionist mood, is extremely fanatic and
      bloodthirsty and it is completely anti-peace. The so-called national unity
      governments in the Zionist entity were historically governments of
      aggression and war. Terrorist Sharon did not form his government to save
      peace or meet our people's rights but rather came to end the intifada
      and quell the resistance with the use of his repressive measures, siege
      and starvation along with threats leveled in all direction hoping to
      restore the Zionists� lost security. The presence of Shimon Peres, the
      butcher of Qana, in that government's foreign portfolio does not change
      its true nature of extremism and aggression. Hence we hope that Sharon
      would not be given any new chance, for such hope is out of the question in
      addition to being a waste of time and a reflection of weakness and
      hesitation that would lure Sharon into more stringency and blackmail.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Palestinian people,
      despite great sufferings and little potentials, have decided to continue
      along the road of intifada and struggle and determined to remain steadfast
      as long as it takes in face of occupation until it leaves Palestinian
      lands and holy places. Such steadfastness, with your support and
      assistance, will defeat Sharon's schemes God willing, and will turn
      upside down the balance in the region and furnish the road for a new stage
      of our Nation's struggle with the enemy in which we will force that
      enemy to withdraw from our lands by force in a serious march for
      liberation and restoration of rights Insha�allah.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We affirm that taking the
      initiative in this conflict is possible and does not require balance of
      power. The balance of wills with a degree of force and unity of ranks and
      stands are enough to restore self-confidence and build a steadfastness and
      resistance strategy instead of the negotiations strategy, which has proven
      its failure and futility over the past years and even made the enemy
      increase its dictates as we kept on reiterating that negotiation was our
      sole strategic option.<b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is no doubt that the
      Palestinian cause is an Arab, Islamic question and even the central issue
      of the Arab Nation. Consequently, our success in settling this question
      and restoring our rights necessitate determination, strength, proper
      planning and daring decisions in addition to activating joint Arab action,
      bypassing side differences and uniting the ranks and efforts towards the
      inevitable confrontation that concerns and targets us all.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We look forward to your
      esteemed summit with hope and expect it to live up to the level of events
      taking place on the land of Palestine and hope that your resolutions would
      include the following demands:</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Supporting the steadfastness of the Palestinian
      people and assisting their intifada with money and arms in addition to
      forming committees for the support of the intifada in all Arab countries
      in its capacity as the means of foiling Sharon's plots and the transfer
      conspiracy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Endorsing legitimacy of
      the Palestinian people's right of resisting Zionist occupation and
      backing that struggle by all means until end of occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Insisting on the
      Palestinian people's rights in full, rejecting the surrendering of any
      of those rights, topped by the right of return, Palestinian and Islamic
      rights in Al-Quds (Jerusalem) including its Islamic and Christian shrines.
      Boosting efforts aimed at stabilizing life of its inhabitants and
      preserving its Arab and Islamic identity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Severing all forms of
      relations with the Zionist enemy and returning to economic boycott of that
      enemy including the reactivation of its committees.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Allocating an Arab day for
      solidarity with Al-Quds and the Aqsa intifada.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Solving all pending
      inter-Arab problems, in a way securing interests of all parties, and
      lifting the siege on Iraq and refusing to bow to American pressures.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">While presenting those
      practical demands to your esteemed summit, which reflect our people and
      Nation's aspirations, we pray that Allah will aid and guide you for the
      sake of our Nation's interest and dignity.</p>
