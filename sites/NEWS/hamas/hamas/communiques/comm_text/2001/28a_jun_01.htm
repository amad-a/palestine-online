      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>A responsible source
      in the Hamas Movement stated the following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Two weeks after detention
      of Mr. Ibrahim Ghoushe in Amman airport while he was returning to his
      country Jordan after the Jordanian authorities� refusal to allow him
      enter the country; the Jordanian authorities contacted the Hamas Movement
      expressing willingness to end the crisis. They offered a solution based on
      the Movement�s readiness not to allow any political or informational
      activity for brother Ghoushe in the name of the Hamas Movement in Jordan
      unless with approval of the Jordanian authorities. They also asked the
      Movement to agree to his departure from Jordan for three days at the most
      after which he would be allowed back into Jordan enjoying full citizenship
      rights in accordance with that agreement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We said that such a step
      could take place without Ghoushe having to leave Jordan even temporarily
      especially when the Jordanian authorities could announce acceptance of an
      Arab mediation to end the crisis. However, to facilitate the matter from
      our side, especially after those authorities� insistence on that
      condition, the Movement agreed after detailed dialogue that led to the
      written agreement signed by a representative of the Jordanian authorities
      and a representative of the Hamas Movement. The Movement retains a copy of
      the signed agreement. Brother Ghoushe was informed of the agreement in the
      presence of a representative of the Jordanian authorities and a
      representative of the Hamas Movement where he affirmed commitment to
      whatever the brothers in the political bureau deemed fit.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">An agreement was also
      reached on implementation mechanism of that agreement. The Movement tabled
      Yemen as the country that would host Mr. Ghoushe for three days in
      appreciation of its mediation initiative and that country would guarantee
      the agreement. We started contacting our brothers in Yemen who welcomed
      the idea and affirmed their preparedness to start their mediation when
      they receive an official contact from the Jordanian leadership. We
      informed the Jordanian authorities� representative with that. However,
      we were surprised at a late hour last night that the Engineer was carried
      to Bangkok instead of Sana�a in mysterious circumstances. The
      Movement�s contact with the Jordanian authorities was severed and the
      Engineer remained isolated from contacts with the Movement, his family or
      his lawyer until the present moment.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In such an atmosphere, the Jordanian government
      announced that it received a message from Mr. Ghoushe then declared its
      permission allowing him to return to Jordan from Bangkok in response to
      instructions of Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah. Consequently the return
      of Mr. Ghoushe is on the basis of not practicing any activity in the name
      of the Movement in the Jordanian arena in accordance with the position
      previously tabled with the Jordanian government by the Movement that was
      endorsed in the aforementioned agreement.</p>
