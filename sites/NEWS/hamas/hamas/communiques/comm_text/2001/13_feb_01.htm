      On the escalation of terrorism and assassination against our Mujahid
      people</font></p>
      <p>A new cycle of intensified terrorism is being waged against our Mujahid
      people along the confrontations arenas confronted by self-defense in face
      of the brutal Zionist enemy. A new and continuous terrorist scheme is
      being hatched aimed at quelling and stopping the intifada and to imposing
      conditions of an oppressive settlement on our people through agreement and
      coordination between symbols of Zionist terrorism Sharon and Barak and
      through understandings reached by the Likud in line with the formation of
      a coalition government.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The savage massacre perpetrated by the
      Zionist enemy in Khan Younis and the Mawasi area, in which more than 100
      people were wounded, other than destroying houses and property then the
      terrorist assassination of martyr Masoud Ayyad from the force-17 furnished
      additional proof to savagery of the occupation and its aggressive plans
      against our people without any distinction.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
      affirms that the policy of indiscriminate torching and cowardly
      assassinations will not deter our people from persisting along the road of
      intifada and struggle with all forms. Our people that resisted all
      aggressive and terrorist campaigns over the past century on the land of
      Palestine and organized one revolution after the other and one uprising
      after the other smashing on their way oppressive and arrogant symbols, are
      capable of indulging in the battle until achieving the goals of defeating
      occupation and returning to their lands from which they were forcibly
      ejected.</p>
      <p>This stage, where the usurping enemy is preparing to launch more
      murders and terrorism, calls on our people to be prepared to shoulder
      their great responsibility. It necessitates providing all requirements for
      steadfastness and resistance in addition to arming those capable of using
      arms within framework of continuous resistance.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">We urge all Arab and Islamic peoples to act
      swiftly in support of our people in their Jihad and intifada. We ask them
      to form various pressure groups against the Zionist enemy so as to halt
      its terrorism and aggression. We also call on all world countries to end
      the conspiracy of keeping silent vis-&agrave;-vis the enemy crimes.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">We are sure of Allah�s victory for He is
      the One capable of annihilating our enemy and make us govern the land of
      Palestine � that of Islam and Muslims � occupation and tyranny will
      definitely end.<o:p>
