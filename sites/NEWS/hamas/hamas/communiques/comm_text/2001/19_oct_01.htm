      <p><b>Our Mujahid people</b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">O� you who have chosen Jihad, resistance and
      intifada as the road towards restoring rights have clearly said to the
      whole world that the Palestinian rights could not be bargained over or
      relinquished. O� you who have proven that the Palestinian people despite
      a year of intifada that was full of wounds and pains were still capable
      and prepared to offer more sacrifices. The Palestinians are always capable
      of creating new methods of confronting the enemy. The Palestinians
      affirmed through the operation that targeted one of the symbols of Zionist
      terrorism (Rahba�am Ze�evi) that all the enemy's security measures
      could not protect it or its occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If the entire Palestinian
      people, with their various trends and forces, have expressed strong
      support of the heroic operation launched by Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa
      Brigades. They even expressed satisfaction to see the enemy have a taste
      of the suffering that it has been subjecting us to by killing our leaders,
      symbols [of our struggle] and Mujahideen. However, the Palestinian
      Authority regretfully disappointed the Palestinian people by arresting
      leaders and cadres of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
      ignoring the feelings of its people. It should have been, instead, busy
      with defending its people against the Zionist enemy's crimes in the past
      few days when the enemy assassinated a number of resistance cadres,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>murdered Palestinian women and children and reoccupied<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Palestinian towns.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We condemn the arrests of
      our brothers in the PFLP and all previous arrests that included cadres in
      Hamas and Jihad Movements. We also urge the PA to immediately release all
      detainees and halt all security and other meetings with the enemy. We
      further ask the PA not to tamper with national unity to serve the
      interests of our enemy and the patron of its terrorism, the American
      administration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We also affirm our
      solidarity and extend our warmest condolences to our brothers in the Aqsa
      Martyrs Brigades who lost a group of Mujahideen especially martyr Atef
      Obayat. We urge the PA to prosecute agents and severely punish all those
      involved in this crime. We also call on the Qassam Brigades and military
      wings of all factions to retaliate to the enemy's crimes and continue
      their Jihad program asserting our rejection of the so called ceasefire.
      Our people's option, which won national consensus, was that of
      resistance and persistence of the intifada. Our people and their Jihad and
      struggling factions will not be terrorized by Zionist threats and will not
      be deceived by American promises and will continue in their steadfastness
      and resistance until ejection of occupation and liberation of our lands
      and holy places God willing.<o:p>
