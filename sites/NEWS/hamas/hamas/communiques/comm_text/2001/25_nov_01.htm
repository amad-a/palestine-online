      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">To our Palestinian Mujahid people, our people in the
      diaspora and steadfast camps, our angry and struggling<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>masses, our Mujahid youths, our steadfast people, our brave
      children, our persevering women, our esteemed Sheikhs and our glorified
      Arab and Islamic Ummah.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">To all honorable and loyal people who refused to heed
      the American ceasefire calls and refused to accept the enemy’s dictates
      and refused to be humiliated in their own lands. To our heroic Mujahideen,
      free strugglers and brave fighters in all parts of our occupied homeland
      and in the diaspora.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">To all of you the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
      bears with pride, patience and steadfastness the glad tidings of the
      martyrdom of its martyr hero Mahmoud Abu Hannoud, commander of the Qassam
      Brigades in the West Bank districts and his brothers the Mujahideen …
      the heroes … the brothers Ayman and Ma’moon Hashayka whose pure blood
      inspired resistance in the masses from the Ocean to the Gulf and who
      renewed hope and strength in those masses along the road of Jihad and
      resistance.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The people took to the streets bidding them farewell
      and renewing allegiance to resistance and support to the Mujahid Brigades
      from which<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yehya Ayyash, Emad
      Akl, Mohiuddin Al-Sharif and other heroic Mujahideen who cleaned the
      hearts and cleared the vision of the Ummah graduated.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hence, Mahmoud did not die but rather his martyrdom
      breathed life in a situation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>almost
      killed by initiatives and understandings. Palestine knows that the man who
      was chasing martyrdom as the Zionist occupation authorities were chasing
      him was inevitably meeting his fate. However, the loss was great and
      painful despite its inevitability. Nonetheless, congratulations should be
      extended for the martyrdom, Allah’s satisfaction and paradise and
      congratulations for meeting Mohammed, peace be upon him, and his
      companions.<o:p>

      Ummah:<o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Our Mujahid hero Mahmoud Abu Hannoud left this world
      heading for the upper site in paradise after spending the best ever years
      in life and after his name was added to the list of heroes of this Ummah
      and after he became a symbol and a model. Cunning minds and sinful hands
      that assassinated the Mujahid hero Mahmoud Abu Hannoud were the same that
      planned for liquidating the Mujahideen leaders such as the martyr Dr.
      Abdullah Azam on 24th November 1989 and the martyr hero Emad Akl on 24th
      November 1993 within framework of a spiteful Zionist-Crusade scheme to
      liquidate Islamic propagators and to abort the phenomenon of Islamic
      renaissance that posed as a nightmare for oppressive regimes, the Zionist
      entity and the hateful crusade countries.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">History is repeating itself; regimes are allying anew
      to uproot Islam and Muslims under the cover of “combating terrorism”.
      Even if America were true in its intentions and calls against terrorism,
      it should have set the Zionist entity at the top of the list of terrorism.
      It should have fought that entity for representing the cruelest form of
      occupation and terrorism and it should have backed the Palestinian people
      (victim of Zionist terrorism) who are fighting to liberate national lands
      and to win freedom and independence after ejecting Israeli occupation. It
      should not justify Zionist aggression that assassinate and murder heroic
      Mujahideen and Palestinian civilians. It was not strange that the Zionists
      and Crusaders would lead the ferocious campaign against Islam and Muslims.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">This savage crime was perpetrated with all cowardice
      and meanness as a reception to the American delegation that arrived at the
      pretext of defusing tensions in the region. The American administration
      did not react in the least in face of such a crime, which affirmed its
      blatant bias in favor of Zionist terrorism. Hence, accepting American
      initiatives and offering concessions just to please it is a very serious
      matter. We urge the Palestinian Authority to declare rejection of all
      oppressive American initiatives and not to abide by what contradicts our
      people’s rights, ambitions and determination.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Our patient Palestinian people:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Our martyr hero has paid the price of pride and
      dignity after performing his duty in full towards his religion, country
      and people. Mahmoud was not only a person who chose the road of dignity
      and pride but he was also a prominent model of a Palestinian generation.
      Through representing that generation, Mahmoud gained his value as a
      Mujahid and a commander who dedicated his life to produce a glorious
      record in various areas of the country. He remained loyal to his creed and
      never got bored or stopped by the lie of the so-called “de facto
      situation” or “prevailing circumstances” but rather topped the list
      of honorable combatants who attack enemy fortresses and who spread panic
      and death in lines of its soldiers and herds of settlers.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, mourn
      today one of our most prominent commanders and affirm that such a savage
      crime would not weaken us or halt our Jihad march or check our Brigades’
      advance towards uprooting the usurping Zionist entity from our holy land.
      Let Sharon and his frightened army know that they will pay dearly for
      assassinating our heroes. We tell him not to rejoice much or smile for
      long because we will smash the fake joy that filled his black, hateful
      heart. And we will wipe out the fascist smile off his face. We will attack
      them with unvanquished soldiers who are used to Jihad as a way of life and
      who yearn for death as their way to martyrdom.<o:p>
