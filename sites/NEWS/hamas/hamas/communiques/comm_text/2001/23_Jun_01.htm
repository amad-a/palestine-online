      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Commenting on the brothers
      in Yemen�s decision to withdraw their mediation, which they had launched
      to end the crisis resulting from the Jordanian authorities� measure
      denying Eng. Ibrahim Ghoushe to enter his country and detaining the Qatari
      plane, a responsible source in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
      stated the following;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>First</b>: We, in Hamas,
      followed up with great appreciation the honorable mediation bid of our
      brothers in Yemen under the patronage of Yemeni president Ali Abdullah
      Saleh, which they tabled out of their keenness on unity of Arab ranks and
      to defuse the crisis between Jordan and Qatar and between Jordan and the
      Hamas Movement. We immediately welcomed the Yemeni mediation and
      positively responded to it out of our keenness to ensure its success but
      the Jordanian government�s stubbornness and insistence on its old stand
      and oppressive conditions that violated the constitution and the interests
      of both the Nation and the case led to halting the Yemeni mediation
      compelling the brothers in Yemen to declare its withdrawal.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Second</b>: We affirm,
      on this occasion, that we in the Hamas Movement had displayed absolute
      keenness and extreme feeling of responsibility in dealing with the
      oppressive decision to deport the four brothers from their country Jordan.
      We gave all the appreciated mediation bids the opportunity to solve the
      crisis especially the sisterly state of Qatar and the dear Jordanian
      figures but the Jordanian government closed all doors before those
      mediations during the past year and seven months of deportation. We had no
      other alternative but to exercise our legal and constitutional right to
      return to Jordan. We informed the Jordanian government with our decision
      through a third party. We also postponed the date of our return more than
      once at the request of the Jordanian government itself so as to give it
      more time. We affirmed to that government our readiness to accept the
      condition of not practicing any political or informational activity in the
      name of the Movement in Jordan. Yet the Jordanian government remained
      insisting on its strange, oppressive and stubborn stance that the deported
      brothers should choose between giving up their Jordanian nationality and
      accept the two years temporary travel documents if they wished to continue
      in their role in service of their people and cause and links to the Jihad
      Movement Hamas or to retain the Jordanian nationality after severing all
      relations with the Hamas Movement. We categorically rejected that offer
      because it contravened the Jordanian constitution and because working for
      the Palestine cause through the Hamas Movement or any other was a duty on
      all those belonging to our Nation and did not contradict their right in
      the nationality they carried.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Third</b>: In the light
      of all this Eng. Ibrahim Ghoushe decided to return to his country Jordan
      in a calm way so as to facilitate things for the Jordanian government but
      it regretfully did not absorb that meaning and chose a boisterous security
      handling of the matter that contradicted the constitution. It furthermore
      fabricated another unjustified crisis with the sisterly state of Qatar at
      a time when terrorist Sharon and his herds of settlers were waging a war
      on our people and at a time when the heroic Qassam Brigades were
      confronting the criminal Zionist enemy and the Qassam elements were
      launching martyrdom operations to defend their people and sanctities in
      addition to avenging for dignity of the Arab and Islamic Nation. The
      Jordanian government is still insisting on detaining Eng. Ibrahim Ghoushe
      for the tenth consecutive day in the Amman airport in an inhuman was that
      does not befit an ordinary citizen let alone a Mujahid like him. That
      government is also exercising pressures on him to accept its oppressive
      conditions under threat and by force and insist at the same time to
      prevent doctors from seeing him or checking his health condition. It
      further barred his family members and lawyers from calling on him!</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Fourth</b>: We salute our brother the Eng.
      Ibrahim Ghoushe for his steadfastness and patience and for his rejection
      of all bargaining on his national and religious role in service of the
      Nation�s central cause and in defense of our Mujahid Palestinian people.
      We also greet and appreciate our Jordanian people with its various trends,
      parties, syndicate and national and Islamic figures for siding with our
      just case. That people expressed solidarity with Eng. Ghoushe and his
      deported brothers, expressed absolute refusal of the Jordanian
      government�s step and affirmed backing to the Hamas Movement in its
      steadfastness and resistance of Zionist occupation. We call on them to
      express more such dignified stands for the interest of Jordan, the
      Palestine cause and the Nation in its struggle against the Zionist enemy.
      We repeat our thanks and appreciation to all Jordanian popular mediations
      and efforts along with Arab bids that sought to solve the unjustified
      crisis and end the detention of brother Ibrahim Ghoushe to enable him
      enter his country.</p>
