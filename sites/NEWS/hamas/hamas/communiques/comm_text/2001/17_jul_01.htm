      <p align="center"><b>A new massacre in Bethlehem to be added to the
      Zionist criminal record</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In a new massacre, the
      Zionist enemy affirmed its ugly face, which had tried to beautify through
      various means. The new massacre employed two American-made Apache
      helicopter gunships that raided the West Bank city of Bethlehem on Tuesday
      afternoon. They fired more than five missiles at two civilian houses in
      which Palestinian citizens were gathered awaiting the release of one of
      their detained relatives from the occupation prison of Majeddo. The
      despicable crime resulted in the martyrdom of:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Omar Saadeh, Mohammed
      Saadeh, Ishac Saadeh and Taha Al-Urouj in addition to wounding 15 women,
      children and youth who were present in the two houses.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">We, in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
      condemn this savage crime by that criminal enemy whose crimes could not be
      covered-up. We urge the whole world, especially those who race to condemn
      the Jihad of our people and their heroic deeds, to denounce that crime and
      to firmly confront the Zionist terrorist and criminal government led by
      Sharon and Peres, the butchers of Sabra and Chatilla and Qana, since the
      crime affirmed that our people were daily facing murder and that all their
      houses and individuals were targeted.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We proudly bear the
      tidings of the martyrdom of those four and affirm that Jihad against our
      enemy will continue. We affirm that the blood of the martyrs of this
      massacre and all martyrs will not be wasted but Insha�allah will serve
      as a beacon along the road of Jihad and resistance until liberation of our
      lands and restoration of our Quds. We affirm that the intifada will
      persist regardless of sacrifices until realizing our people's goals and
      aspirations for the sake of which they have sacrificed and are still
      sacrificing enormously.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We affirm, as history of
      our Jihad proves, that the enemy will pay the price of its crimes. Let the
      enemy know that with such a crime it turned all Zionists on our lands into
      legitimate targets of our Jihad and operations and that the Islamic
      Resistance Movement, Hamas, and its military wing the Qassam Brigades will
      violently retaliate <b><i>�And soon will the unjust assailants know what
